                                <p>Seems <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2008-05-29-gas-prices-75-dollar-limit_N.htm?csp=34">another sign</a> of the new era of banking fraud awareness comes from the price of gasoline/fuel.  You can&#8217;t pump more than $75 worth. <br />
<blockquote>The $75 limit &#8220;ensures merchants and customers are protected from fraud,&#8221; says MasterCard spokesman Tristan Jordan.</p></blockquote>
<p>Visa and Mastercard are worried about you and the station getting ripped off.  Really?  Interesting though how the station owners say it is the policy of the card companies but Visa said it&#8217;s the fault of the owner.  <br />
<blockquote>Visa and MasterCard have no immediate plans to go higher. &#8220;It&#8217;s something we always look at,&#8221; Wilke says.<br />Visa raised its pump limit from $50 in April, but $75 isn&#8217;t keeping up with gas prices. At $4 a gallon, $75 buys 18 3/4 gallons. A 2008 Toyota Sequoia SUV&#8217;s tank holds more than 26 gallons, a Chevy Avalanche sport pickup totes up to 31 1/2 gallons, and a 33-foot or longer Winnebago Adventurer RV hauls 75 gallons.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course there is a solution.  Swipe it twice, or in the case of the RV, 4 times.   Too much? Then they offer that you can  run your card inside.  Frankly, I&#8217;m not sure what difference there is in protection if you swipe the card inside.  The card company is still going to be on the hook if the cashier doesn&#8217;t ask for ID.  </p>

<blockquote><p>I have not read the book. I will once I finish eating the contents of my sock drawer (which ranks slightly higher on my to-do list).</p></blockquote>
<p>Now if you think the second sentence in this quote is juvenile – don’t bother reading the rest of Goldberg’s rant.  OK, I lied.  It is not a stinging review.  In fact, it is about as idiotic as anything from this worthless pundit.  But please consider this:</p>
<blockquote><p>McClellan’s only legitimate beef seems to be his unjust treatment during the Valerie Plame investigation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Really?  The book has no other legitimate complaints?  How on earth would Jonah know if he hasn’t even bothered to read anything?  I guess his mommy told him so.  Incidentally, NRO has other attacks on McClellan’s writing, which are also just as worthless.</p>

                                <p>Properly speaking this is not an economics post. So most of it is below the fold.</p>
<p>I started a Social Security blog in Nov. 2004 in the wake of Bush&#8217;s announcement that he would expend his new political capital on Social Security &#8216;reform&#8217;. At that point in time I had been looking at these numbers for about seven years and had largely formed the conclusions I have been laying out in this series. In blunt terms I knew that &#8216;crisis&#8217; was in context bullshit, and I also knew along side Dean Baker that this was &#8220;well known to those who have looked at the numbers&#8221;. So this post is an attempt to answer two questions: one, &#8216;why do they persist anyway?&#8217; and two, a question I posed in one of my first posts &#8216;Who the hell am I to be lecturing economists on Social Security?&#8217; </p>
<p>As most readers know I am not an economist, I never took even an Intro course in Economics and the closest I got to the tools of the trade was Statistics 20, Introduction to Statistics for Non-Majors, and that 33 years ago. So who am I to take this subject on? Well the answer is that Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is not at bottom an economic question to start with. Certainly all of the surface action suggests that the issue is retirement security and that the question revolves around whether or not that will be economically sustainable at some future point. But having poked around in the numbers for years I knew that really wasn&#8217;t the core issue, the results under Intermediate Cost were certainly acceptable, while results closer to Low Cost were at least plausible. Which raised the question &#8216;Why do they care?&#8217;. After all these people have no problem cutting heating oil subsidies for today&#8217;s seniors, with requiring kids to remain uninsured for a full year before they can transfer from a private plan to a new government alternative. Many of the same people who want to privatize Social Security to &#8216;save&#8217; it simultaneously advocate for abolishing the Department of Education. These are the farthest thing from bleeding heart liberals, yet they profess to be deeply concerned about retirement security for future generations, aye verily even unto the Infinite Future Horizon. But why? And just as importantly &#8216;Why now?&#8217;</p>
<p>Well I explored the question in a July 2005 post <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2005/07/social-security-it-it-about-solvency.html">Social Security: is it about Solvency or about Ayn Rand?</a>. And the conclusion I came to was this:<br />
<blockquote>The numbers are important, if you are going to participate in the debate over the future of Social Security you need to understand them, you need to understand their implications, you need to be able to measure them against the numbers you read in the paper every day. Because oddly enough this debate is not about numbers and in most respects it never has been.</p></blockquote>
<p>The oppostion to Social Security has always been driven by the ideology, and that ideology can only be understood in historical perspective, and particularly in the millennia long struggle between the powerful and the people over the distribution of production. Which is where I come in, I was in fact a trained historian with a speciality in Medieval Europe but substantial side work in Classical Greece and Ancient Rome. And over the course of that study I learned a couple of fundamental truths, one the issues hadn&#8217;t changed much between the time of the Gracchi brothers (133 BC) and the Cato Institute of today, and two the historiography is almost always charged with the class struggle of the time. The modern study of Rome can hardly be separated from the economic ideology of those first historians. That is we see the Gracchi brothers and later Caesar through a historical lens fundamentally hostile to what were considered dangerous democratic and even socialistic impulses. It is worth noting the Cato the Censor, after whom the Cato Institute is named, was the sworn enemy of the Gracchi brothers&#8217; grandfather Scipio Africanus, and for same reasons, although Africanus like Caesar was the ultimate son of privilege, achieving all the highest offices, he dared to suggest that the interest of the people at large be considered.</p>
<p>Who knew that proposals for land distribution in 2nd century BC Rome or the history of the Statute of Laborers (1351) and successor acts in England would be relevant to the Social Security debate today? Well that is why we are here.</p>
<p>The powerful have always been alarmed and often to the point of physical violence at any scheme that remotely smacks of being redistribution and this impulse historically preceded by centuries the development of classical economic theory. If you examine the actual economic history that paralleled the development of the new theory you can clearly see that the former infused the latter, there is only one degree of separation between a nineteenth century liberal economist and a nineteenth century liberal manufacturer. When examined in the historical perspective of the centuries before and close to two centuries after you see an academic discipline shaped by the political class struggle of the day, although admittedly perhaps largely invisible to the actual theorists involved.</p>
<p>A successful Social Security system is a threat to the powerful in much the same way that the throughly aristocratic Gracchi brothers land distribution plans were. Because once you let the camel of &#8216;greatest good for greatest number&#8217; get its nose under the tent who knows where it will stop. Which of course was Hayek&#8217;s premise in Road to Serfdom, admit that government planning works in some cases, next thing you know you are in the gulag. (For those who think this too strong, try reading the authorized 18 panel cartoon version of <a href="http://www.mises.org/books/TRTS/">The Road to Serfdom</a> (hosted on Marek&#8217;s mothership mises.org).</p>
<p>The question of &#8216;Why now?&#8217; is itself explained by this 1998 article from our friends at Cato <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.org/pubs/ssps/ssp11es.html">The Myth of the 2.2% Solution</a>. On my reading they had simply panicked, people like Baker and well, Webb were pointing out some inconvenient numbers, which led the Cato folk to assert the following:<br />
<blockquote>The 2.2 percent figure assumes that the reform would take effect at the beginning of calendar year 1998. Thus it is already out of date. Each year Congress waits, the magnitude of the tax hike required to balance the Social Security trust funds rises.</p>
<p>The solution is not permanent. In fact, an additional tax hike would be required every year to keep the trust funds in balance over a full 75 years.</p>
<p>The 2.2 percent solution is based on the Social Security trustees’ &#8220;intermediate&#8221; projection. If we accept the trustees’ &#8220;high-cost&#8221; projection, whose key economic and demographic assumptions more closely reflect historical experience, the necessary tax hikes would be at least twice as large.</p>
<p>The 2.2 percent solution focuses only on the program’s solvency. But simply raising taxes (or cutting benefits), while it may balance the Social Security trust funds, does nothing to redress the program’s other underlying problems, most notably the declining rate of return for young workers.</p></blockquote>
<p> Only problem none of these are factually true. In fact in the years since the magnitude of the tax hike needed has gone down, the solution is permanent and requires no additonal tax hikes during the 75 year window, the high-cost projection doesn&#8217;t remotely reflect historical experience, and at best the declining rate of return is dubious, indeed the 78% of 160% = 125% equation suggests just the obvious.</p>
<p>In short they were and are panicking, the debate was slipping out of their control, and their only response was half-truths and lies to disquise their actual, ideological committment to the principles of Cato the Elder. Social Security is thus not an economic question at all, instead it is a case study in the centuries long struggle between democracy and reaction.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.economist.com/daily/news/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11441149&#038;fsrc=nwl">The Economist</a> poses some conjectures for oil and Iraq:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Things may be changing. Iraq&#8217;s deputy prime minister, Barham Salih, said in April that Iraq&#8217;s total reserves, could be as high as 350bn barrels, triple the 115bn that has been its officially stated level for many years. The figure is aspirational and should be treated carefully but, given that there has been barely any new exploration of Iraq&#8217;s promising geology in 30 years, an upward revision of the official reserves figure seems long overdue. This underlines Iraq&#8217;s uniquely large reserves-to-production (RP) ratio, which was already the world&#8217;s highest and, based on Mr Salih&#8217;s estimate and at the expected production level of 2.3m b/d in 2008, would stand at a remarkable 415 years (compared with a world average of about 40 years). If Iraq were able to achieve the average Middle East RP-ratio of 80 years then it would be pumping 4m b/d based on the current reserves, and 12m b/d based on Salih&#8217;s aspirational estimate. Getting there would take some time, around five years for 4m b/d and probably more than 20 years for the most optimistic level. It would also require Iraq to achieve a sufficient degree of stability. However, if there are promising signs of progress over the next 18 months, then it might be enough to mitigate fears of shortages next decade and dampen the futures market.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Although there is some way to go, 2008 may be seen as the year in which Iraq&#8217;s oil industry began to recover and, when the markets recognise this, it may take some of the edge off the oil price. However, given Iraq&#8217;s history of dashed expectations, it would be unwise to factor major production increases into oil supply projections until Iraq has passed a series of important tests. One of these is whether the Iraqi army will be able to maintain security as the US draws down its troops. Another is whether the rival Shia movements led by Muqtada al-Sadr and Abdel-Aziz al Hakim can make the transition from street fighting to purely political competition—an issue that will probably not be resolved until the next general election in December 2009. Finally, the KRG and the rest of Iraq will need to conclude that it is worth reaching a compromise on Kirkuk (the disputed northern province that contains Iraq&#8217;s largest oilfield) and regional autonomy in order to share in the benefits that a major expansion in the oil industry will bring.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hakim is replacing Iraqi troops specifically with his followers, so some of the Army and Badre Brigade overlap.  The next question might be whether Maliki can ever defy Hakim if ever he even desires it, or how it plays out in 2009 elections by province.  And to see how the Awakening Council holds together and participates.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="http://www.conocophillips.com/newsroom/other_resources/testimony2.htm%3Cbr%20/%3E">Conoco Phillips Oil</a> points to a US based dilemma-access to supplies is dwindling in testimony to Congress.</p>
<blockquote><p>I cannot over-emphasize the access issue. Access to resources is severely restricted in the United States and abroad, and the American oil industry must compete with national oil companies, who are often much larger and have the support of their governments. We can only compete directly for 7% of the world’s available reserves, while about 75% is completely controlled by national oil companies, and are not accessible.</p></blockquote>

CalculatedRisk <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/05/fdic-banks-hit-by-troubled-real-estate.html">has highlighted</a> the deterioration of the &#8220;coverage ratio&#8221;, which is &#8220;loss reserves as a percentage of nonperforming loans&#8221; is now at it&#8217;s lowest level since 1993.</p>
<p>I wanted to highlight this figure from page 7, which I found particularly striking:<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SD762DmHPBI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/9mfIUpE-O08/s1600-h/qbp-loans.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SD762DmHPBI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/9mfIUpE-O08/s400/qbp-loans.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />From the report on noncurrent loans:<br />
<blockquote>Noncurrent Loan Growth Remains High<br />Even with the heightened level of charge-offs, the amount of loans and leases that were noncurrent (90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status) rose by $26.0 billion (23.6 percent) in the first quarter, following a $27.0-billion increase in the fourth quarter of 2007. Loans secured by real estate accounted for close to 90 percent of the total increase, but almost all major loan categories registered higher noncurrent levels. The amount of real estate construction and development loans that were noncurrent increased by $9.5 billion (47.2 percent) during the quarter, while noncurrent loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties other than home equity lines of credit increased by $9.3 billion (20.2 percent). Noncurrent real estate loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties increased by $2.2 billion (28.5 percent), and noncurrent home equity lines of credit rose by $1.5 billion (29.5 percent). Noncurrent C&#038;I loans increased by $2.4 billion (24.9 percent). During the quarter, the percentage of total loans and leases that were noncurrent rose from 1.39 percent to 1.71 percent, the highest noncurrent rate for the industry since the first quarter of 1994. At institutions with assets greater than $1 billion, the average noncurrent rate at the end of the quarter was 1.74 percent. At smaller institutions, the average rate was 1.52 percent. More than half of all insured institutions &#8212; 52.2 percent &#8212; saw their noncurrent rates rise during the first quarter. Restructured loans and leases (which are current under modified terms) increased by $4.0 billion (57.6 percent) during the quarter, but almost half of the increase was caused by banks including restructured 1-4 family residential real estate loans for the first time. These restructured loans added $1.8 billion to the total amount of restructured loans at the end of the first quarter. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<p>As CalculatedRisk has been saying for some time, the wave of bank failures is coming. The FDIC isn&#8217;t on a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120398607404892133.html?mod=hpp_us_whats_news&#038;apl=y&#038;r=887335">hiring spree</a> just to beef up their softball team with professional MLB ringers a la <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/8F13.html">Mr Burns from the Simpson&#8217;s</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/6774491845409045519/#700512">Commenter </a><a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/6774491845409045519/#700512">              Michael McKinlay</a> points to <a href="http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewarticle+articleid_1930576~zoneid_Home.html">this figure</a> at istockanalyst.com. The figure was put out by Credit Suisse last summer I believe. I&#8217;ve heard it referred to several times as the &#8220;Reset Tsunami&#8221;. And               Michael McKinlay is right; there is a lot more ugly to come, and a lot of it has to do with the mortgage mess.</p>
<p>Also, I believe this reset schedule has been revised since Credit Suisse put this one together. If anyone knows where there is a more recent schedule, I&#8217;ll update the post with a link.</p>

Just a data point on which we may need to work later, and a report that will be of interest to many who read here.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: As <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/2267437700143372143/#700541">rdan notes in comments</a>, this &#8220;links to testing for mad [cow disease, or BSE] as well.&#8221;  And since I&#8217;m a week or so behind in my blog-reading, I&#8217;ll just refer everyone to this <a href="http://usfoodpolicy.blogspot.com/2008/05/banning-downer-cattle-allowing-tests.html">U.S. Food Policy post</a>, which used economic reasoning to come to a depressing but clear conclusion.***</p>
<p>One of the ways in which externalities are created is with differing regulations on what should be the same product.  The quality of the Grade-A beef you buy that was raised in Texas should be the same as the Grade-A beef that was raised in Mexico and imported.  If the inspection processes are not the same, though, the chance of contamination is raised.</p>
<p><em>I hasten to note that the probability of contamination in both cases is rather low, if you assume that the firm is an ongoing concern that plans to do business with you again.</em>*</p>
<p>But what is the effect of contaminated meat slipping through?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad you asked, and so is the USDA.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/Publications/ERR57/#2008-5-28"><br />Economic Impacts of Foreign Animal Disease</a> seeks to address the question. Though it deals specifically with foot-and-mouth disease, the report:<br />
<blockquote>presents a quarterly livestock and crop modeling framework in which epidemiological model results are integrated with an economic model of the U.S. agricultural sector to estimate the economic impacts of outbreaks of foreign-source livestock diseases. The framework can be applied to many livestock diseases[.]</p></blockquote>
<p>To what I trust is no one&#8217;s great surprise, the model predicts larger losses than just the animals slaughtered:<br />
<blockquote>Model results show large trade-related losses for beef, beef cattle, hogs, and pork, even though relatively few animals are destroyed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even the bromide at the end (&#8220;The best control strategies prove to be those that reduce the duration of the outbreak.&#8221; Really??) doesn&#8217;t change the economic reality: the best way to ensure the highest return is to spend money on inspection.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever used the financial markets for hedging purposes could tell you that.  It&#8217;s good to see that the USDA has done the analysis to justify a uniform process of inspection of foreign meats; the only question is whether they realise that is what they have done.**</p>
<p>*It is, for instance, common knowledge in some parts of Eastern Europe that, if you are offered lumber at a lower-than-market price, it probably comes from the Chernobyl area.</p>
<p>**This appears to be noting new: here&#8217;s <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&#038;res=9D00E1D61F3EE733A2575BC2A96F9C946797D6CF&#038;oref=slogin">a 1906 NYTimes article</a> (PDF) dealing with jurisdiction over testing meats. (That was, of course, the year after <a href="http://www.booksamillion.com/ncom/books?id=4119949291530&#038;isbn=1884365302"><em>The Jungle</em></a> was published. Even then, loopholes were the rule, not long-term sustainability.)</p>
<p>***&#8221;Instead, the officials&#8217; actions seem to me most consistent with believing there are a handful of real cases of BSE out there in the beef cattle population, and that these cases will naturally die out without infecting new cattle over the next several years. Of course, if this were true, a handful of people would be subjected to risk of the deadly disease years after eating a cow whose infection was never discovered.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>I know I promised to back off the pace but yesterday&#8217;s comment thread got temporarily derailed before the point could be made. In yesterday&#8217;s post I highlighted the cash flow in and out of the General Fund to redeem the Trust Fund <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/soc-sec-xiii-crisis-at-shortfall-or.html">&#8216;Crisis&#8217; at Shortfall</a> in an effort to show that in inflation adjusted dollars the payback was no big deal. Well wouldn&#8217;t benefit cuts or a cap increase make the problem even smaller? Well no, you just end up taking the problem out in time by a year or so and make the ultimate cost bigger. Take the numeric series from yesterday for Intermediate Cost or here today for Low Cost and apply the effects of either benefit cuts or tax increase. Once again the left column represents total surplus and so the increase in Trust Fund balance, while the right column represents current year cash flow to or from the General Fund (in constant 2008 dollars). Either a benefit cut or a tax increase will increase the dollars in both columns. A good thing? Well not really. Because the real dollars in the right column from either benefits not being paid in full or more revenue coming are just spent in the current year. If this actually reduced current year borrowing dollar for dollar it would be one thing, but there is no real world evidence that this actually happens. So boom that extra cash is spent. And the left column properly considered is actually an increase in interest earning debt. You are not doing your kids any favors by starving gramma, not if the result is extra payments in the form of future interest on an even bigger interim Trust Fund. The net effect is to move the date of Intermediate Cost shortfall out a bit, and depletion out maybe quite a bit all at the cost of larger needs for future General Fund transfers to pay for that compounding interest. So that is Intermediate Cost. What happens with Low Cost? Well first the numbers, discussion under the fold.</p>
<p>Low Cost Surpluses and Cash Flow to/from the General Fund<br />2010 $236, $106<br />2015 $267, $78<br />2020 $250, $8<br />2025 $217, -$68<br />2030 $170, -$122<br />2035 $169, -$160<br />2040 $205, -$143<br />2045 $273, -$104<br />2050 $358, -$66<br />2055 $455, -$40<br />2060 $567, $17<br />2065 $715, $18<br />2070 $801, $58</p>
<p>What is with the negative numbers? I thought Bruce was always telling us that Low Cost meant fully funded?</p>
<p>Well it does, if you use the Trustees&#8217; definitions of Income and Cost. For the Trustees, who as the name assume have to act as if the Trust Fund is real (after all they are the guardians), Income includes Interest. But if you step back and look at this in the total budget perspective you see that Interest is suddenly transformed from a source of Income to an open obligation on the General Fund. With the results you see above, starting in about 2023 a portion of the interest earned needs to be tapped to pay benefits. But whereas under IC this portion rapidly increases after 2017 and takes in all interest by 2023, under Low Cost the effect always remains partial. In the 2007 Report the result was a system in equilibrium, with approximately 25% of all cost being paid by transfers from the General Fund. Which raises our first problem, in last years Report this subsidy goes on forever, while the utility of the actual dollars borrowed fades as the decades go by. That is not really a good outcome. In the 2008 Report the effect is only worse. Because while the needed transfers grow until about 2035 (though never as high as IC) they start shrinking until in around 2056 the need vanishes completely as Income excluding Interest once again exceeds Cost.</p>
<p>Well the problem is that you now are stuck with a near useless $12 trillion Trust Fund merrily compounding away. But you can&#8217;t just abrogate it by explaining that almost all of it what just the effect of interest on interest and so in some sense disconnected from the real economy. Because the worker of 2056 is going to look at that string of negative numbers from 2023 to 2055 and likely think &#8216;Hell they were real enough when my income tax dollar was being tapped to pay some of that interest&#8217;. But redeeming the now useless Trust Fund to eliminate the future effects of those compound interest dollars requires lowering FICA taxes by enough to offset the total accrued interest plus some extra reductions in rates to allow some gradual paydown on principle. Which means you would have to boost your transfers from 2055&#8217;s $40 billion to at least $470 billion in 2056 simply to keep you in the same place financially. So instead of having to pick up 25% of the tab for a time limited span of 2017 to 2053, here you pay varying portions of the tab through 2055 ramping down to 1% and then get a sharp jump back to 25%, more if you want to take any serious crack at paying down the principle. In effect Low Cost either requires your grandkids simply to accept that they were taxed extra all those years, that now that we didn&#8217;t need the extra income they should just get over it. Or tell them yeah the money is real and we want $470 billion a year forever out of income tax. Just to add some spice to the soup the end result is that Low Income workers who pay little or no income tax get a huge tax cut. Because the only way to make the books balance is to cut FICA back dollar for dollar in relation to that General Fund transfer.</p>
<p>Put this in a matrix with lifetime Low, Medium and High Income Worker on one axis, and Entry age, Median age, and New retiree then start examining where the incidences hit. And who woulda thunk it, the people who get crushed are people earning around the payroll cap.</p>
<p>Okay in this scenario what is the effect of either a benefit cut or a cap increase? Well once again it keeps the numbers in both columns more positive for a longer period of time, that is instead of a negative number from 2023 to 2055 you get a smaller transfer for a shorter period of time. But all that means is an even bigger Trust Fund and more accrued interest at the point of crossover and so an even HIGHER need for General Fund transfers to keep the beast of Interest on Interest from eating you up.</p>
<p>In the cold light of day the &#8216;right&#8217; answer is to take it as you would if you found out that your insurance company made record profits because of lower than expected claims. As long as all your claims were honored, who cares? I&#8217;ll be 99 in 2056. But I have some nieces, nephews and great nieces who will be rapidly approaching retirement at that point. I don&#8217;t see how screwing over Great Gramma Alice and Great Uncle Bruce on their retirement bought them anything more than a huge political mess. That is why benefit cuts and cap increases backfire.</p>

                                <p>Reader Whatever sends along an article on the health system in Singapore written in <a href="http://american.com/archive/2008/may-june-magazine-contents/the-singapore-model">The American</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The People’s Action Party has ruled Singapore since the British left, and is led today by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founder Lee Kuan Yew. It calls the health system it has put in place the “3M” framework: Medisave, Medishield, and Medifund. </p>
<p>Medisave, which covers about 85 percent of all Singaporeans, is a component of a mandatory pension program. Employees typically pay 20 percent of their wages into the Central Provident Fund (CPF), while employers pay 13 percent. (Since 1992, the self-employed have also participated.) At the beginning of 2007, CPF had over $1 billion in surpluses. </p>
<p>In Singapore’s system, the primary role of government is to require people to save in order to meet medical expenses they don’t expect.<br />Medisave accounts can be used to pay directly for hospital expenses incurred by an individual or his immediate family. Limits are in place on the extent of Medisave funds that can be used for daily hospital charges, physicians’ fees, and surgical fees. The idea is to cover fully the bills of most patients in state-subsidized wards of public hospitals. Beyond that, individuals dip into their own pockets or use benefits from insurance plans (see more on this below). Medisave can also be used for expensive outpatient treatments such as chemotherapy, renal dialysis, or HIV drugs. </p>
<p>Medishield, the second part of the program, is a national insurance plan that covers the higher cost of especially serious illness or accident, which in Singapore’s system is described as “catastrophic.” Singaporeans can choose Medishield or several private alternatives, some offered by firms listed on the Singaporean stock exchange. Premiums for the insurance plans, including Medishield, can be paid using Medisave accounts. </p>
<p>Medifund, the third part, was established by the government for the roughly 10 percent of Singaporeans who don’t have the means to pay for their medical needs, despite the government’s subsidy of hospital and outpatient costs. The fund was set up in 1993 with $150 million, with the budget surplus providing additional contributions since then. Only interest income, not capital, may be disbursed. </p>
<p>Finally, there’s Eldershield, an addition to the 3M structure that offers private insurance for disability as a result of old age. It pays a monthly cash allowance to those unable to perform three or more basic activities of daily living. </p>
<p>Nearly all Singaporeans contribute directly toward each treatment, including prescription drugs, through patient co-payments of 20 percent for amounts above deductible levels. The money to meet deductibles and co-payments can come out of a person’s Medisave account.</p></blockquote>
<p>Additional material and comments are below the fold:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>In Singapore’s system, the primary role of government is to require people to save in order to meet medical expenses they don’t expect. While the Singaporean government does regulate prices and services, its hand is nowhere near as heavy as that of governments with extensive nationalized healthcare, such as the United Kingdom or Germany. </p>
<p>John Tucci, head of general insurance consulting for North Asia for Watson Wyatt Insurance Consulting, says, “The use of compulsory savings has been very successful as the main source of private funding for hospital expenses. </p>
<p>“Another key focus of the government has been to ensure that overall health expenditure does not fall victim to the significant inflationary pressures that have been evident throughout the world. This has been achieved by regulating the supply and prices of healthcare services in the country.” Even the United States rations treatments and sets prices both through government regulation and purchasing and through private insurance rules. </p>
<p>The United States spends 15.4 percent of its GDP on healthcare, while Singapore spends just 3.7 percent.<br />Tucci warns that it may be hard to replicate Singapore’s system in the United States. After all, Singapore has a small, concentrated population, with a “backdrop of political stability, enabling successive governments [all of the same party] to introduce consistent measures relating to individual responsibility, compulsory savings, and regulatory control of healthcare services and costs.” </p>
<p>The public healthcare facilities in Singapore have been clustered, since 2002, into two integrated networks, each government-owned and managed as nonprofits: the National Healthcare Group (NHG) on the western side of the city-state, and Singapore Health Services (SingHealth) on the eastern side. Each provides a full range of services, running the public hospitals and specialty centers as private companies. </p>
<p>The Health Ministry says that these clusters “provide cooperation amongst the institutions within the cluster, foster vertical integration of services, and enhance synergy and economies of scale. The friendly competition between the two clusters spurs them to innovate and improve the quality of care while ensuring that medical costs remain affordable.” </p>
<p>Each of the networks also benchmarks against international standards and publishes exhaustive performance figures. In its 2007 report, NHG says its vision is “adding years of healthy life.” The goal, the report says, “departs from merely healing the sick to the more difficult but infinitely more rewarding task of preventing illness and preserving health and quality of life.” </p>
<p>Meanwhile, 80 percent of primary healthcare needs are met by private general practitioners and 20 percent by public outpatient “polyclinics” of hospitals, chiefly those run by the two clusters, NHG and SingHealth. Within the private general practitioner sector, a significant proportion of patients—about 12 percent of them—consult traditional Chinese practitioners. </p>
<p>Phua Kai Hong, associate professor of health policy and management at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, describes the crucial social setting that enabled the country to create its remarkably successful health system: a dynamic economy (with 7.5 percent GDP growth in 2007 and an average income per person of about $34,000, or three-quarters that of the United States), strong family ties and social support systems, a high propensity to save and invest, a rapidly aging and affluent population, and an absence of socialized models of social security, social insurance, or healthcare. </p>
<p>He lists five core prerequisites for countries that may want to emulate Singapore’s system: a willingness and ability to save; high participation in formal employment; effective payroll collection with efficient fund management and claims processing; a well-developed information system with strong security and accounting controls; and effective public education in the proper use of medical accounts. </p>
<p>Within the private-public mix, he says, most people lean toward the private system for primary care and the public system for hospital care. There are 13 public-sector specialty centers and hospitals in Singapore and 16 private-sector hospitals. But 74 percent of the beds are within the public sector. The government has also introduced low-cost community hospitals for intermediate healthcare for the convalescent and aged. </p>
<p>Why does Singapore’s system work? Phua cites these principles: “the creation of incentives for responsible behavior and the efficient delivery of services; the discouragement of overconsumption through cost-sharing; the regulation of hospital beds, doctors, and the use of high-cost medical technology; the promotion of personal responsibility; targeted government subsidies; and the injection of competition through a mix of public- and private-sector providers.” </p>
<p>Medical savings, he says, are now being accumulated to ensure that the Singaporean society of the future will be able to look after its own health needs even with a steady rise in the population of elderly people. </p>
<p>But, he adds, there remains room for further evaluation of clinical quality and outcomes as the system continues to evolve.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rdan here:  The article reads like a sales pitch, but perhaps adds to the debate on what is possible for &#8216;savings&#8217; to happen concerning healthcare costs.</p>
<p>1.  If Social Security creates a huge fuss at 6+% collection rates in the US, can you imagine  a proposal for 20% (consumers) and 13% (employers)collections even if it saved money.<br />2.  Singapore has a history of what we would consider draconian solutions.  In this case the governments mandates private savings accounts in a public-private mix.  Does anyone have additional information?</p>
