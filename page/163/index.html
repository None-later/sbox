<p>Libertarians come in many flavors, but I think most of them would agree that in an ideal world, the government would be very small and have limited powers &#8211; essentially, the government would control national defense and perhaps adjudicate over property rights disputes (i.e., maintain police and/or the courts). Otherwise, people would be free to engage in whatever activities they wished provided the specific purpose of that activity was to harm a third party. Based on conversations with libertarians, I believe negative externalities, or inadvertent harm to third parties is OK. I have yet to have a discussion with a libertarian and come away thinking: now this is a person who views negative externalities as an intrusion on someone else&#8217;s private property requiring government intervention to halt. (If I am incorrect about this, I&#8217;ll be happy to stand corrected&#8230; but it has little effect on the rest of this post.)</p>
<p>Now, one of the side effects of a very small, laissez-faire government is that tax rates will be very low. This means that the accumulation of wealth will be faster for those with a comparative advantage at creating goods and services other people want to buy. (I&#8217;m ignoring <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/simple-explanation-for-strange-paradox.html">this effect</a>, which is easy to verify <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/optimal-tax-rates-for-generating.html">empirically</a>, but then libertarians believe lower taxes result in faster economic growth and I want to focus on their assumptions here.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, without an inheritance tax or estate tax (I think it is fair to say most, perhaps even all libertarians are against these types of taxes), fortunes would pass on more intact from one generation to the next than we see happening today. In such a world, the accumulation wealth over two or more generations could allow a person or family to accumulate a greater percent of a given area&#8217;s wealth than we see happening today. </p>
<p>But&#8230; the libertarian world is one without public infrastructure. So who would build or own the roads in a given area? Well, it won&#8217;t be folks who don&#8217;t have any money, that much is evident. Presumably those who otherwise have accumulated significant resources&#8230; such as a person or a family that controls a sizable piece of the wealth in that area. </p>
<p>Now, a lot of types of infrastructure, such as roads, electric grids, and the like, have significant first mover advantages. There may be a lot of traffic on a road from A to B, or an electric grid serving the area, and monopoly rents could easily be extracted. If a second mover built a duplicate road or electric grid, it would harm the first mover&#8230; but it also wouldn&#8217;t happen, because the second mover knows the price war would make it impossible for it to profit as well. </p>
<p>This, by the way, isn&#8217;t pie in the sky theorizing or guesswork. We&#8217;ve seen precisely that in the real world. For example, in the years following the 1996 Telecom Act, incumbent phone companies were deathly afraid that their network would be duplicated&#8230; and except for a few BLECs in big cities (most of which promptly went under even so) there was no replication of the last mile. Similarly, you don&#8217;t see replication of the last mile in the electricity industry, which I mention because when it comes to deregulation, the electricity industry is where telecom was in the late 1990s. (Yes, it is not a perfect analogy, but electricity and phone calls aren&#8217;t the same thing.) </p>
<p>We do, occasionally, see the private provision of toll roads, but usually after the owner of that toll road extracts a promise from the government to reduce maintenance of any competing publicly owned road. Which means&#8230; in any given area, there isn&#8217;t going to be competition in the provision of roads and other infrastructure.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>This is important for a combination of two reasons. The first is that a monopoly extracts monopoly rents. Monopoly rents, of course, will increase and speed the process by which wealth is concentrated, and, as most libertarians will tell you, monopoly rents create market inefficiencies. But movie theaters run their own concession stands, and if you want to set up a snack bar in a Wal-Mart, you better expect to turn over most of your profits to Wal-Mart. Unless there are rules preventing it (not likely in a libertarian paradise), the owner of the infrastructure calls the shots, deciding who can and who cannot do business. </p>
<p>But the second problem with a monopoly in roads and other infrastructure is far more important. It means, simply put, there is no voting with one&#8217;s feet if the road owner chooses to prevent it. (Of course, the next region over might be run the same way anyhow.) So if you don&#8217;t like the way the people that own the roads and the markets and the apartment you rent do business, you can&#8217;t exactly up and leave without using their road or otherwise cutting across their land. And if they don&#8217;t let you do it, well, you&#8217;re breaking the law&#8230; and the Pinkertons could easily prevent you from doing that. The average person, the person not born into resources, could be left with one option to full cooperation &#8211; loss of shelter, food, and even membership in society.</p>
<p>Now, if this sounds unrealistically dystopian to you, remember that it took far less coercion than that to keep people tied to Company Towns not a hundred years ago in this country. The Company Towns did not own the roads or the land once you were out of town, the only chains were financial. </p>
<p>The road to serfdom is very pretty when you first get on it, so much so that those who are most vocal in warning us about the perils of where it leads don&#8217;t realize that&#8217;s the destination they&#8217;re promoting.</p>

<blockquote><p>The moment you threaten to strip politicians of their legal graft, they&#8217;ll moan that they can&#8217;t govern effectively without it. Perhaps they&#8217;ll gravitate toward reform, but often their idea of reform is to limit the right of &#8220;We the people&#8221; to exercise our freedom of speech in the political process.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned from local, state and national political experience that the only solution to entrenched corruption is sudden and relentless reform. Sudden because our permanent political class is adept at changing the subject to divert the public&#8217;s attention—and we can no longer afford to be indifferent to this system of graft when our country is going bankrupt. Reform must be relentless because fighting corruption is like a game of whack-a-mole. You knock it down in one area only to see it pop up in another.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />What are the solutions? We need reform that provides real transparency. Congress should be subject to the Freedom of Information Act like everyone else. We need more detailed financial disclosure reports, and members should submit reports much more often than once a year. All stock transactions above $5,000 should be disclosed within five days.</p>
<p>We need equality under the law. From now on, laws that apply to the private sector must apply to Congress, including whistleblower, conflict-of-interest and insider-trading laws. Trading on nonpublic government information should be illegal both for those who pass on the information and those who trade on it. (This should close the loophole of the blind trusts that aren&#8217;t really blind because they&#8217;re managed by family members or friends.)</p>
<p>No more sweetheart land deals with campaign contributors. No gifts of IPO shares. No trading of stocks related to committee assignments. No earmarks where the congressman receives a direct benefit. No accepting campaign contributions while Congress is in session. No lobbyists as family members, and no transitioning into a lobbying career after leaving office. No more revolving door, ever.</p></blockquote>

<p>Why did the English equivalent of Occupy Wallstreet pick St Paul’s as the place to protest?</p>
<p>Because St. Paul’s is hand in glove with the City of London Corporation, the place where democracy and light “goes to die,” the place where there is no accountability or transparency for the powerful 1%.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/oct/31/corporation-london-city-medieval?">An overview by George Monbiot</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://falseeconomy.org.uk/campaigns/item/the-city-of-london-corporation-protest1">A comment by the protesters</a>: Why are they there, in that spot of London?</p>
<p>An attempt to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2010-2011/0166/11166.pdf">shed light</a> on the dark heart of capitalism, the City of London Corporation. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Watch the events in London carefully. I am surprised that economists have not commented on what the City of London Corporation. Our banks are there…unfettered by any regulation, any oversight. Goldman and Sachs? You betcha.</p>
<p>The priests and clergy that have resigned have resigned because they know the truth of what this place is—and how St. Paul’s is complicit.</p>
<p>Anyway, this will whet your conspiracy bug…and it is true.</p>

<blockquote><p>1. V shaped real retail sales and industrial production recoveries vs. jobs:</p>
<p>&#8230;Comparing those with private jobs (red) and total payrolls (green), we can see that the percentage losses in sales and production were steeper, and have made up nearly or more than all of their ground compared with jobs. Meanwhile, private jobs have regained only slightly over 30% of their losses. When government employment is added for the total jobs picture, fewer than 25% of the losses have been regained.</p>
<p>2. Comparing improvements in aggregate hours and jobs:</p>
<p>&#8230;Another point I have frequently made is that aggregate hours worked are recovering faster than new jobs. Since more hours were lost than jobs during the recession, if past was prologue then we would have to wait for aggregate hours to regain their lost comparative ground before job growth would match the growth in hours&#8230;.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />3. Comparing real retail sales with jobs:</p>
<p>&#8230;This is yet another indication of just how significant government job losses have been to the relatively poor jobs recovery. At the same time, because real retail sales are a leading indicator for jobs, this reinforces that we should expect to continue to see positive job growth in the economy, with private jobs at least being added at something like a 2% YoY rate.</p>
<p>4. Comparing initial jobless claims with jobs added:</p>
<p>&#8230;In 2010 I thoroughly debunked the idea that we needed 400,000 or less in initial jobless claims to be consistent with job growth. It simply makes a lot of difference how deep the recession is, and also the pattern declining into a recession is quite different from the pattern during a recovery. I pointed out half a year ago that if we were to descend into a &#8220;double dip,&#8221; I would expect to see a break in trend in the scatter graph comparing these two series, with a new trend line to the left of the recovery trend line developing.</p>
<p>5. Okun&#8217;s Law</p>
<p>Okun&#8217;s law is actually a rule of thumb that holds that for every 2% YoY increase in GDP, there should be a 1% decline in the unemployment rate. Generally speaking, 2% YoY GDP growth equals no change in unemployment. A 4% GDP increase gives you a 1% decrease in unemployment. Contrarily a 0% YoY change in GDP gives you a 1% increase in unemployment.</p>
<p>I make use of a corollary, which is the YoY% growth in GDP minus 2% approximately equals the YoY% change in job growth 3 to 6 months later. Here is the graph of this relationship going back 65 years, and it has ominous implications:</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>As I said, this contradicts virtually all of the previous indicators we have discussed. A possible explanation comes via <a target="_blank" href="http://oldprof.typepad.com/a_dash_of_insight/2011/11/weighing-the-week-ahead-waiting-for-the-ecb.html">Jeff Miller of A Dash of Insight</a>, who informed us yesterday that the BLS&#8217;s Dynamic Business Report of actual job data collected from the states showed that in the first quarter of this year only 250,000 jobs were created, rather than the 500,000 previously reported.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The House Appropriations Committee recently offered up <a href="http://capwiz.com/ticas/utr/1/EAPVQWEUXE/HJRBQWGFYD/7638725271">a bill</a> that would cut students&#8217; Pell Grants &#8211; the cornerstone of the student aid system &#8211; by $44 billion over 10 years. The bill, if passed, <a href="http://capwiz.com/ticas/utr/1/EAPVQWEUXE/DPEEQWGFYE/7638725271">would slash millions of students&#8217; Pell Grants</a>: completely eliminating grants for more than 550,000 students next year and for more than 1 million students in 2017, and reducing grants for millions more. </p>
<p>The statistics can&#8217;t be ignored: though the unemployment rate for recent college graduates was 9.1 percent in 2010, that&#8217;s still less than half the unemployment rate for young adults with only a high school diploma. A <a href="http://capwiz.com/ticas/utr/1/EAPVQWEUXE/MRWRQWGFYF/7638725271">recent bipartisan poll</a> showed that young adults of all backgrounds and across the political spectrum oppose cutting access to Pell Grants. </p>

<p>Herman Cain and the Defense of Marriage</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t my usual beat, but I was fascinated to read <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57332384-503544/woman-claims-13-year-affair-with-herman-cain/">this statement</a> by Herman Cain&#8217;s attorney:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rather, this appears to be an accusation of private, alleged consensual conduct between adults &#8211; a subject matter which is not a proper subject of inquiry by the media or the public. No individual, whether a private citizen, a candidate for public office or a public official, should be questioned about his or her private sexual life. The public&#8217;s right to know and the media&#8217;s right to report has boundaries and most certainly those boundaries end outside of one&#8217;s bedroom door.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an odd position given that Cain <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/220679/herman-cains-lastest-flip-flop-a-federal-gay-marriage-ban">supports a ban on gay marriage</a>.  After all, supporters of gay marriage have long argued that what two consenting adults do in their bedroom should be nobody else&#8217;s business.  I wonder if Cain or his supporters will change their position on gay marriage.</p>

<blockquote><em>Is Capital Gains Tax Law Biased Against Low Income Investors?</em>
<p><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=384843">Min Dai</a> (National University of Singapore, Department of Mathematics), <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=106088">Hong Liu</a> (Washington University, Olin Business School) &#038; <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=783859">Yifei Zhong</a> (University of Oxford, Mathematical Institute), <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1962118">Is Capital Gains Tax Law Biased Against Low Income Investors?</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The current capital gains tax law stipulates that the tax rate for short-term investment (gains and losses) and long-term losses is equal to an investor&#8217;s marginal ordinary income tax rate, which implies that this rate for low income investors can be significantly lower than that for high income investors. In an optimal consumption and investment model with asymmetric long-term/short-term tax rates, we show that even though capital gains tax rates for low income investors are always lower than those for high income investors, the current capital gains tax law is significantly biased against low income investors in the sense that these investors are willing to pay a substantial fraction of their initial wealth to gain the same capital gains tax treatment as high income investors have. <a name="more"></a> The main reason is that investors have the option of realizing capital losses at the (higher) marginal ordinary income tax rate and realizing capital gains at the (lower) long-term tax rate and the value of this option is significantly lower for low income investors than that for high income investors. This result is robust to various changes in model parameter values. Raising capital gains tax rates for low income investors to the levels for high income investors would reduce the bias and substantially increase stock market participation by low income households. With regard to the optimal tax realization strategy, in sharp contrast to most of the existing literature, we show that it can be optimal to defer short-term capital losses beyond one year and to realize short-term gains.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/11/social-insurance-and-unemployment-do-people-deserve-poverty.html">Mark Thoma</a> responds to the meme that the social safety net encourages bad behavior overall:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The idea that the unemployment problem is due to lack of effort on behalf of the unemployed rather than a lack of demand is convenient for the moralists, but inconsistent with the facts. The problem is lack of demand, not the means through which we smooth the negative consequences of recessions.</p>
<p>But what really irks me is the implicit moralizing, the idea that people deserve to be thrown into poverty. Someone who gets up every day and goes to a job day after day, often a job they don&#8217;t like very much, to support their families can suddenly become unemployed in a recession through no fault of their own. They did nothing wrong &#8212; it&#8217;s not their fault the economy went into a recession and they certainly couldn&#8217;t be expected to foresee a recession that experts such as Casey Mulligan missed entirely. <a name="more"></a> They had no reason to believe they had chosen the wrong place to go to work, but unemployment hit them anyway. And since one of the biggest causes of foreclosure is an event like unemployment, it&#8217;s entirely possible that this household would lose its home, be forced to declare bankruptcy, etc., and end up in severe poverty if there were no social services to rely upon.</p>
<p>What moral lesson is being taught here? <!-- more --&gt  Why does this household deserve to be punished for their bad decisions? It did nothing wrong. I understand that people should suffer the consequences of their own bad choices, but that's not what happens in recessions. People who have done nothing to deserve it are nevertheless hit by severe negative shocks. That's what social insurance is for, to smooth the path for such unfortunate households, to avoid sending people into poverty who have done nothing to deserve it (see "<a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/04/_the_need_for_s.html">The Need for Social Insurance</a>"). It is not an attempt to reward bad behavior and most programs do their best to avoid giving benefits to people who have made bad choices (for example, the system is far from perfect but in most states unemployment insurance can only be obtained if you lose your job through no fault of your, e.g. if you quit or get yourself fired it is not available). The extent to which we should distinguish between deserving and undeserving households for social insurance programs is debatable and depends upon the type of program, but the idea that all households are undeserving is, in my view, simply wrong. I would apply the social safety net widely myself -- I think the benefit of the doubt should go to compassion, not harshness and moralizing -- but in any case I'd dispute the idea that "safety-net generosity" is too high. If anything, we are not generous enough.</p>

                                <p>By Jazzbumpa at Retirement Blues comes this re-posting that runs parallel to Dan Becker&#8217;s post <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/11/defining-rich-iv-corporate-vs-personal.html">here</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2011/02/federal-government-tax-reciepts.html">Federal Government Tax Receipts</a>
<p> Where do you think they come from?  I&#8217;ll just give it away:  Personal Income Taxes, Corporate Income Taxes and FICA (<i>the payroll tax: you know that hyper-regressive flat tax &#8211; nominally for Social Security and Medicare &#8211; with a ceiling, and from which there are no exemptions nor deductions.</i>)  Note: Other sources of income &#8211; excise taxes, and other miscellaneous revenues are not included in this analysis, and are excluded form the totals.    <br />OK.  That was easy.  This one is not.  How much of Federal Taxes do you think comes from each source?    <br />Oooh.  Toughie.  I suspect you will be surprised.  I sure was    <a name="more"></a>  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals/">The White House Office of Management and Budget</a> is a Storehouse of useful information &#8211; including the answer to this vexing question.    <br />Here is a graph showing the log of tax receipts from these sources, since 1934.  Individual Taxes in Blue, FICA in Yellow, and Corporate in Red.   This is on a log scale.  The upside: constant growth presents a straight line.  The downside: differences on that scale are really hard to assimilate.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JuuRg_3-njQ/TWGWZ4gRrMI/AAAAAAAABMY/24MhBMbCNhQ/s1600/Fed+Tax+Recipts.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JuuRg_3-njQ/TWGWZ4gRrMI/AAAAAAAABMY/24MhBMbCNhQ/s400/Fed+Tax+Recipts.jpg" width="400" height="236"></a></p>
<p>What we can see here is that there was a time in the late 30&#8217;s when receipts from corporate taxes and personal taxes were about equal.  It was even a 3-way near-tie with FICA for a couple of years. After that, corporate taxes steadily declined for decades as a portion of the total.    (The spike down in the data between 1976 and 1977 is due to a separately tabulated calendar quarter in the tables.)   <br />Here&#8217;s  a close up of the last couple decades, on a linear scale.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7KUY-TIjCcw/TWHHUQYIZlI/AAAAAAAABMs/11C0j_KT19U/s1600/Tax+Rcpts+since+1990.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7KUY-TIjCcw/TWHHUQYIZlI/AAAAAAAABMs/11C0j_KT19U/s400/Tax+Rcpts+since+1990.jpg" width="400" height="236"></a></p>
<p> <!-- more -->
<p>Imagine what the size of the deficit would be without FICA!  Ponder the meaning of these lines at a time when corporate profits are at record highs, and unemployment levels are at record highs!   <br />Now, lets look at the data in a totally different way, to put all this in perspective.  Here, each source is presented as a percentage of the total Federal Tax Receipts.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-POmygAIKt9w/TWGwb1zEjxI/AAAAAAAABMc/xL7inaUcXOc/s1600/Tax+Rcts+Pctg.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-POmygAIKt9w/TWGwb1zEjxI/AAAAAAAABMc/xL7inaUcXOc/s400/Tax+Rcts+Pctg.jpg" width="400" height="236"></a></p>
<p>Can&#8217;t tell you exactly what I might have expected, but it sure as hell wasn&#8217;t this.   Pick your inflection point &#8211; either &#8217;77 or &#8217;84 will do.  Since 1977, the percentage of the total paid by corporations has wobbled around a bit, but averaged 11% of the total.   The percentage coming from personal income tax has been 50%.  Obviously, the amount contributed by FICA is 39%.  Let&#8217;s have a look at trends since 1977. </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EpS_X0JPkVM/TWG2xFeEquI/AAAAAAAABMg/j8U4DTCK6Dg/s1600/Tax+Rcrp+%2525+since+77.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EpS_X0JPkVM/TWG2xFeEquI/AAAAAAAABMg/j8U4DTCK6Dg/s400/Tax+Rcrp+%2525+since+77.jpg" width="400" height="236"></a></p>
<p>The corporate tax trend is basically flat at 11%. The contribution from individual taxes is actually at a slight decline.  Meanwhile the trend for contribution from FICA has steadily increased for well over 30 years!   <br />Are you as shocked as I am?    <br />Here, to put the perspective in perspective, is a look at total receipts, on a log scale. </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-da99o-CkqSM/TWG7cbMbE8I/AAAAAAAABMo/WOIQYEG0AKc/s1600/Log+Federal+Tex+Reciepts.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-da99o-CkqSM/TWG7cbMbE8I/AAAAAAAABMo/WOIQYEG0AKc/s400/Log+Federal+Tex+Reciepts.jpg" width="400" height="236"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve placed a couple of best fine lines, a blue one through the entire data set, and a red one through the period 1958 to 2000, which seems a little more regular than the entire set.  At the far end, we had the Great Depression and WW II.  At the near end we had Bush tax cuts, Bush wars, an the ensuing Great Recession. Surprisingly, the red line has a slightly lower slope than the blue line.  Not surprisingly, total receipts have been close to flat for the last decade, as the Bush tax policies have succeeded in starving the government.   <br />General observations:    <br />1)  During the post WW II golden age, the corporate contribution to total tax receipts, though continually declining, was typically far greater than during <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2011/01/what-hell-friday-vocabuary.html">The Great Stagnation</a> &#8211; the period since roughly 1980.    <br />2)  The FICA contribution to the total, despite a break point to a lower slope circa. 1980, has grown steadily since WWII.  It is now virtually tied with personal income tax for the biggest contribution chunk.    <br />3) Since the turn of the century, tax cuts and a stagnating economy have caused a huge gap in tax receipts.  Grover Norquist&#8217;s plan to destroy government by starvation is working like a charm &#8211; at the Federal, State, and local levels.    <br />4) Not shown here, but obvious if you think about it or <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/government-investment-and-the-post-70s-prosperity-gap.html">look for the data</a>, is the <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2011/01/government-spending-and-great.html">decline the growth in government spending</a>, at all levels &#8211; for everything except defense &#8211; since 1980.    <br />If, like Norquist, you want life without government, take a look a Somalia.  Or dig out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_35?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&#038;field-keywords=a+distant+mirror+by+barbara+tuchman&#038;sprefix=a+distant+mirror+by+barbara+tuchman">A Distant Mirror</a> by Barbara Tuchman and see what life in Europe was like in the 14th Century &#8211; a time when society deteriorated, there was little or no effective government, and roving bands of thugs terrorized peasants, kings, and even the Pope.</p>
