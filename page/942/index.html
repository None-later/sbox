                                <p>Lou Dobbs has invited a few folks to discuss immigration.  Of course, he treats those who counter his anti-immigrant spin with the same disdain that Bill O’Reilly treats liberals as he pretends he is bringing the truth to this issue.  But at one point, he said Mexico was the richest of all Latin American nations.  <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/mx.html#Econ">This source</a> says per capita income is $10,000.  Not only is that not rich, it is lower than the per capita income of Chile and Puerto Rico.  Maybe Mr. Dobbs doesn’t consider these two nations to be part of Latin America.  </p>

                                <p>As a little bonus addition to my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/healthcare-cost-increases-by-president.html"> previous post </a> on healthcare costs…. </p>
<p>Looking at the period after LBJ (i.e., after the expenses for the Great Society were incurred), here are some correlations:</p>
<p>Annual % change in federal gov’t expenditures on health as a share of total expenditures on health and the annual % change in real health expenditures per capita: correlation = -0.19  (negative 19)</p>
<p>Annual % change in total gov’t expenditures on health as a share of total expenditures on health and the annual % change in real health expenditures per capita: correlation = -0.36 (negative 36)</p>
<p>Average % change over four years in federal gov’t expenditures on health as a share of total expenditures on health and the annual % change in real health expenditures per capita:  correlation = -0.16 (negative 16)</p>
<p>Average % change over four years in total gov’t expenditures on health as a share of total expenditures on health and the annual % change in real health expenditures per capita:  correlation = -0.17 (negative 17)</p>
<p>Conclusion:  The correlation between the government’s share of the nation’s healthcare expenses and the rate at which these expenses rise is negative.  In plain English – the more involved the government gets in healthcare, the slower the healthcare costs rise.  Sure, correlation is not causality, but if private health insurance was the panacea the president makes it out to be, the correlation between government involvement in healthcare and the rate at which healthcare costs increase should be positive.  Whatever GW is doing, if it increases the private share of the healthcare dollar, it will probably benefit private providers of healthcare or insurance at the expense of the rest of us.</p>

                                <p>“Since taking office, President Bush has proposed and implemented commonsense reforms designed to reduce health care costs, expand health care coverage, and improve the quality of care.”</p>
<p>“Every American deserves reliable, high-quality, and reasonably priced health care that will be there when needed.”</p>
<p>Both quotes from Reforming Health Care for the 21st Century”, released by the White House on February 16, 2006</p>
<p>In my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/abortions-and-unwed-mothers-by-numbers.html"> last post</a>, I noted that while the GOP seems to have the loyalty of voters who consider abortions and marriage their primary issue, the rate of abortions actually decreased faster under Clinton than under Reagan, GHW, and GW.  Clinton was also the only one under whom the number of births to unmarried women (per 1000 women) decreased.  Thus… a President who talks a lot about a given issue may not perform well at that issue.  (Recall cactus’ 1st law:  “Those who talk a lot about ethics, morality, and/or patriotism generally don’t have any.”)</p>
<p>A more bipartisan issue, but which also seems to lean GOP over the last few decades, is the cost of healthcare.  </p>
<p>The yearly percentage increase in real private expenditure per capita on healthcare:</p>
<p>Kennedy__7.45%<br />LBJ______4.77%<br />Nixon____4.71%<br />Ford_____4.00%<br />Carter____3.87%<br />Reagan___5.28%<br />GHW____5.57%<br />Clinton___1.83%<br />GW______5.68%</p>
<p>It seems that in general, Democrat presidents have tended to do a better job of keeping down real private healthcare costs than Republican presidents, and this has become especially true more recently.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps you are thinking – sure, one can keep down private healthcare costs by increasing public healthcare expenditures.  The table below shows total real expenditures – private, federal and state:</p>
<p>Kennedy__7.85%<br />LBJ______8.58%<br />Nixon____5.86%<br />Ford_____5.77%<br />Carter____4.04%<br />Reagan___4.93%<br />GHW____6.18%<br />Clinton___2.52%<br />GW______6.08%</p>
<p>Under JFK and LBJ, total expenditures rose by quite a bit due to the launch of the “Great Society.”  But for the most part, the pattern is the same whether one looks at only private or total healthcare expenditures…  real per capita spending on healthcare increases more slowly when a Democrat is the President than when a Republican is President, and this pattern is becoming more pronounced.</p>
<p>Which brings us to right now.  GW has given a number of speeches on the issue of healthcare, and he seems to be looking for a way to keep costs from spiraling any more out of control.  I think the obvious suggestion is for him to do whatever it was that Clinton was doing. </p>
<p>Data:<br /><a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/06s0118.xls"> Cost of healthcare </a><br /><a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt"> CPI </a><br /><a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid"> Population (NIPA Table 7.1) </a></p>
<p>My spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them.</p>
<p>Update.  Added in a few words to ensure it is clear &#8211; the expenditures referred to in the post are real, not nominal.</p>
<p>Update 2.  In my first pass, I did not take geometric means&#8230; this produced the wrong yearly percentage growth rates, which has since been corrected.  Apologies.</p>

<blockquote>Bush said &#8220;my idea&#8221; is that Americans at lower income levels would see benefit payments continue on the current basis, but &#8220;if you&#8217;re a wealthier citizen, your benefits increase at the cost of living &#8230; so everybody&#8217;s benefits go up but some go up faster than others.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Kash notes:<br />
<blockquote>And much more importantly, I was surprised that he made no mention of any effort to address the fiscal problem that makes the Social Security gap look tiny by comparison: the impending fiscal crisis that will be brought on by federal health spending in coming decades.</p></blockquote>
<p>But I want to focus on how Bush’s love for the Pozen plan puts him at odds with Edward Prescott’s brand of supply-side economics as evidenced by his interview with the <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/business/articles/1019Prescott19.html">Arizona Republic</a>:<br />
<blockquote>“It&#8217;s easy to get over $200,000 in income with two wage earners in a household,” Prescott said. “We want those highly educated, talented people to work.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well maybe it’s not so easy for everyone.  <a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr2811.pdf">Prescott’s</a> <em>Why Do Americans Work So Much More Than Europeans?</em> worried that payroll contributions would be viewed as employment taxes and generate disincentives to work:<br />
<blockquote>In some countries, some social security taxes are savings because benefits increase with income. But this is a marginal tax rate. Often there are no additional benefits to working an additional year. In the United States, the marginal savings factor is tiny. First, when I use a 4 percent discount rate and a 2 percent growth rate in the real wage, which are numbers for the U.S. economy in the twentieth century (McGrattan and Prescott 2003), the present value of benefits is only one-quarter of the present value of contributions. Second, the social security benefit scheme is highly progressive. Third, benefits to married couples typically go up little if both people work rather than if only one works. Fourth, beginning in the early 1990s, a significant part of social security benefits is subject to income taxes for many people. Fifth, for many older workers, their current-year taxable labor income has little or no consequences for the retirement benefits they receive.</p></blockquote>
<p>As AB readers know, I’m not that impressed with Laffer curve arguments as a rule and I have tended to suggest that if the current system is maintained (let’s hope, let’s hope) much of what we pay into the system can be seen in some sense as savings and not an employment tax.  Prescott is sort of agreeing with this point of view but he does suggest a few reasons why higher income workers might see at least part of their payroll contributions as employment taxes on the margin.  Given his concern about the incentives for “highly educated, talented people to work”, I have to wonder if Dr. Prescott is not happy that President Bush has turned into such a liberal with this Pozner plan?</p>

<blockquote>The Democrats Had Taken Over and You Were Able to See Their New Taxes</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right – vote Republican.  Your long-run taxes will continue to rise as they “spend and spend and borrow and borrow”, but I guess it’s harder to see deferred tax liabilities.  Is the theme of the GOP campaign this season, vote for us because you are stupid?</p>

                                <p>Stephen Slivinski has released his <em>Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors: 2006</em>.  He gives California’s governor a D:<br />
<blockquote>Governors who received praise in previous editions of the report card but have lower grades this year include Arnold Schwarzenegger of California (current grade, D); Jeb Bush of Florida (current grade, C); Bill Owens of Colorado (current grade, D); George Pataki of New York (current grade, D); and Bill Richardson of New Mexico (current grade, C) … Arnold Schwarzenegger: He received accolades for his first two years on the job when he received an A in the 2004 edition of this report card. This year, however, his grade has dropped to a D. It seems that the California governor has changed his stripes completely. After one year of aggressive budget cutting, he has let the big spenders in Sacramento get to him. Today, California state government is 12 percent bigger in real per capita terms than it was after his hard-fought battle to eliminate the massive $15 billion deficit. Now his efforts are geared toward expanding government, not scaling it back. It’s likely many voters no longer recognize the Arnold Schwarzenegger they elected in 2003 … The plot of the second reel of the current Arnold Schwarzenegger film has taken a turn for the worst. In the first reel, Schwarzenegger played an aggressive budget cutter who slashed spending by around $6 billion over two years and reversed Gray Davis’s car tax hike. Part of his budget fix, however &#8211; a $15 billion bond to cover year-to-year expenses &#8211; looks in retrospect like a harbinger of things to come. Lately, while he’s held the line against tax increases, he’s also been eager to expand government massively. Over the past two years, Schwarzenegger proposed budgets that boosted spending several times faster than population growth. This year he cut a deal with the Democrats in the state legislature to hike the budget by 10 percent. He also conspired with them to put on the ballot a massive $37 billion bond to pay for infrastructure projects, many of which have been rightly criticized as pork. Meanwhile, the recommendations produced by his first-year budget task force, which could produce $32 billion in budget savings, collect dust like a forgotten screenplay on a shelf somewhere. Schwarzenegger is no longer the small-government crusader he claimed he was when he auditioned for the role of governor. He has instead become a borrow-and-spend version of the big spending governor he unseated in 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>ARNOLD is bragging that he has avoided increasing taxes – but even the Cato crowd understands that his borrowing is only deferring the tax bill.</p>

<p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MWVmMDQ2M2EwN2VhMjlmZmQ3ZDMyNjc0MTAxODhkZWM=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> is concerned that President Bush will not be able to veto a tax increase:<br />
<blockquote>There are essentially two kinds of pay-go. One is a spending limitation that was used by the Gingrich Congress to balance the budget in the 1990s. This would be good. The other is a revenue pay-go, which is not so good. In this scenario, if the Democrats cobbled together a big-bang deficit-reduction package, large tax hikes would be put in place to meet the new deficit targets. Since Congress scores the investor tax cuts on dividends and capital gains as static revenue losses &#8211; even though the evidence shows they pay for themselves &#8211; these tax cuts would be subject to repeal or rollback. Should revenue pay-go materialize, President Bush might be confronted with a Hobbesian choice of vetoing a so-called $500 billion deficit-reduction package that would increase the cap-gain, dividend, and top-income-bracket tax rates. Truth be told, the Democratic party desperately wants to return the income-tax rate to President Clinton’s 39.6 percent. It’s an obsession that’s lodged in the Democratic DNA, a class-warfare mentality that seeks to penalize the rich and soak American success. In practice, it would be a Soviet-style income-leveling exercise in the name of making the non-rich feel better. And it’s nonsense. President George W. Bush’s tax cuts have done an amazing job of reigniting the U.S. economy. The 2003 tax cuts rallied the stock market, generated 6.5 million new jobs, and produced soaring revenues that have, in turn, slashed the deficit.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with only one sentence here: “And it’s nonsense”.  The evidence does not show that tax cuts pay for themselves.  The deficit is a lot higher than it was when we had Clinton’s tax rates as real tax revenues per capita have fallen.  And economic growth for the past six years has averaged less than 2.5% per year – so this claim that fiscal irresponsibility leads to more long-term growth is bull.  </p>
<p>But this is all old news.  The real howler in Kudlow’s latest dishonesty is that it was the spending cuts from the Gingrich Congress that led to the fiscal responsibility during the late 1990’s.  The problem with this spin is that Federal nondefense spending did not fall as a share of GDP in any material way.  Yes, defense spending fell as a share of GDP but the neocon nitwits that Kudlow hangs out with want more defense spending – not less.  Beyond the Peace Dividend, the other material thing that led to the Clinton fiscal responsibility was the tax increase that every Republican opposed and that Kudlow cannot bring himself to acknowledge.  But you might ask – when was the last time Lawrence Kudlow not lied about fiscal policy?  To be honest, I can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: A comment from AB reader 2slugbaits led me to graph Federal spending relative to GDP in terms of defense purchases (DP), nondefense purchases (NP), and “other” (transfer payments).  Our graph spans the 1976 to 2005 period and does show the decline in defense spending relative to GDP during the 1990’s.  It also shows there was very little change in nondefense purchases relative to GDP.  As far as other expenditures relative to GDP, our graph indicates that there may be business cycle effects – that is, increases in the ratio during weak aggregate demand periods and decreases during booms.  But if Kudlow can spot an alleged long-term decline in Federal spending during the reign of Newt Gingrich as Speaker, might I suggest you have his glasses checked.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/theplank?pid=51044">Jonathan Chait</a> reads Kudlow and reacts with:<br />
<blockquote>This isn&#8217;t some wacky Kudlow opinion here, this is simply wrong. There&#8217;s only one kind of pay-as-you-go budget rule that has ever been in effect. It came about as a result of the 1990 budget deal&#8211;the one with the Bush tax hike that Kudlow and his pals denounced as the greatest betrayal in American history. The rule said, simply, that any new entitlement spending or tax cuts must be offset by cuts in entitlement spending or tax hikes. Hence the term &#8216;pay-as-you-go.&#8217;   The rule worked fantastically well, and was credited by various budget geeks with helping to eliminate the budget deficit throughout the 1990s. Then Republicans killed it when George W. Bush became president, and they embarked upon their tax cut and prescription drug bill orgy, neither or which could have passed into law if the pay as you go rules were still in place.  Democrats have tried to reinstate those rules, and have been voted down. They&#8217;re promising to enact them if they win Congress. Apparently the prospect was so horrific to him it prompted his latest hallucination. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>Even if <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZDM5N2ZiZGI0MWFiMThiY2E0OGVlMzVjMzBmMjZlM2M=">Jonathan Martin</a> says so:<br />
<blockquote>Next month’s election could prove decisive on something that has nothing to do with Iraq, control of Congress, or the House page program. At stake? The free-trade consensus in the Senate that has ensured easy passage of every measure liberalizing trade put forth by the past two administrations. Democrats only need six seats to gain a majority in the Senate, but the election of five new Democrats and one independent in particular would have even greater ramifications. Should seats currently held by free-traders in Ohio, Vermont, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Rhode Island, and Missouri go to “fair traders” &#8211; and should the sour environment for Republicans prevent them from gaining any seats from Democrats &#8211; the bipartisan commitment to free trade in the Senate would almost certainly end, torpedoing the prospects for any significant legislation in President Bush’s final two years and perhaps longer while fundamentally altering the character of the upper chamber.</p></blockquote>
<p>Martin on the one hand says there is some “bipartisan commitment to free trade” and on the other hand that we need a Republican majority to avoid trade restrictions.  Martin mentions NAFTA but forgets to mention that it was the efforts of a Democratic Administration that secured its passage.  The House vote on NAFTA was 234-200.  Of the 234 votes for NAFTA, 102 came from Democrats.   Yes, there were Republicans who voted against NAFTA.  </p>
<p>Should we also remind Mr. Martin that President Clinton said no to steel tariffs but President Bush imposed them?  <a href="http://www.reason.com/0606/fe.bb.the.shtml">Bruce Bartlett</a> gets it right with his <em>The President’s Rotten Record on Trade</em>:<br />
<blockquote>GOP control of Congress was very thin, and with the economy in recession many Republicans were skittish about voting to promote trade if it might be seen as threatening domestic jobs.  Republicans in the steel-producing districts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia were especially fearful of electoral retaliation. They demanded that Bush do something to help the steel industry as the price for their vote on trade-negotiating authority. In June 2001, Bush initiated an investigation by the U.S. International Trade Commission into whether the steel industry was being injured by imports. It was virtually preordained that the commission would find such injury, because of the low legal threshold for such a determination. The commission did indeed find injury in December. Under the law, President Bush had until March to decide what actions he would take to protect the steel industry.  At the same time, Republicans from agricultural areas were complaining about low farm prices and demanding more subsidies, even though Bush had promised to move toward a more market-based agricultural system during the 2000 campaign. It was vital Bush do the right thing on the 2002 agriculture bill because the whole point of the trade negotiations, known as the Doha Round, was to remove subsidies for agriculture, which cost taxpayers in the industrialized countries dearly while making it impossible for farmers in the developing world to compete and better themselves. In both cases, Bush made exactly the wrong decision &#8230; Bush’s overt protectionism may not be that great. But in overall policy, he’s the most protectionist president since Hoover. All of Hoover’s successors until Bush understood the fragility of free trade and the dangers of playing politics with it. They also understood that there is an inherent drift toward protectionism that needs to be vigorously resisted and offset by aggressive trade-opening measures. Bush has gone in the opposite direction, repeatedly using protectionism to buy short-term political support and sabotaging multilateral trade negotiations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bruce correctly notes that there are trade protectionists in the Democratic Party, but he is under no delusional that a Congress that rubber stamps every wish of the Bush Administration will put us back on the path to trade liberalization.</p>

<blockquote>Pentagon officials plan to split the logistics contract, under which Halliburton has raked in roughly $15 billion since 2001, among four vendors, with bidding to begin on July 28. Halliburton, Vice-President Dick Cheney&#8217;s former employer, could still win a chunk of the new deal. Army officials say they&#8217;re happy with Halliburton&#8217;s services, but Defense Dept. auditors have questioned $1.2 billion in charges. Halliburton says its work has been &#8220;nothing short of amazing&#8221; and that opening up the contract for competitive rebidding is a routine Pentagon move.</p></blockquote>

Indeed, the $75 million in revenue that Halliburton has collected so far by putting out oil fires and repairing refineries in Saddam Hussein&#8217;s former turf will add insignificantly to its profits &#8211; perhaps a penny a share this year. Even if the contract eventually reaches $600 million, as projected by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, it&#8217;ll account for less than 4% of Halliburton&#8217;s annual revenue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Current revenues can be a poor way of judging expected future cash flows.  Iraq is mentioned a lot in Halliburton’s 10-K filing for fiscal year ended December 31, 2005:<br />
<blockquote>We conduct business worldwide in about 100 countries. In 2005, based on the location of services provided and products sold, 27% of our consolidated revenue was from the United States, 24% of our consolidated revenue was from Iraq, primarily related to our work for the United States Government, and 10% of our consolidated revenue was from the United Kingdom. In 2004, 26% of our consolidated revenue was from Iraq and 22% of our consolidated revenue was from the United States. In 2003, 27% of our consolidated revenue was from the United States and 15% of our consolidated revenue was from Iraq &#8230; Our government services revenue related to Iraq totaled approximately $5.4 billion in 2005, $7.1 billion in 2004, and $3.6 billion in 2003 … In 2005, Iraq-related work contributed approximately $5.4 billion to consolidated revenue and $172 million to consolidated operating income, a 3.2% margin before corporate costs and taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Swopa is correct about the role that the Iraq contracts have played in increasing Halliburton revenues, which rose from $16.3 billion in 2003 to $21.0 billion in 2005.  Operating profits in 2003 were only $0.72 billion or 4.4% of revenue.  In 2005, operating profits jumped to $2.66 billion representing a 12.7% operating margin.  </p>
<p>Halliburton’s 10-K filing attributes much of the improvement in operating profits to developments with respect to its Energy Services Group (ESG):</p>
<blockquote><p>ESG improved performance with a 26% increase in revenue and an 80% increase in operating income, compared to 2004. ESG operating margin (defined as operating income divided by revenue) increased nearly seven percentage points to 22.6% from 15.8% in 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>For companies with multiple lines of business, focusing on developments in one line may miss the big picture.</p>

<blockquote>ALAN D. VIARD, a former Bush White House economist currently at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, recently told the Washington Post: &#8220;Federal revenue is lower today than it would have been without the tax cuts. There&#8217;s really no dispute among economists about that.&#8221; He&#8217;s right. There&#8217;s no dispute among economists. Conservative, moderate or liberal, every credentialed economist agrees that the Bush tax cuts caused revenues to drop. There is, however, a dispute between economists and pseudo-economists. Supply-siders may be laughed at by real economists, but they still enjoy a strong following among politicians, including, alas, the president of the United States. Here is what President Bush said a week and a half ago:</p>
<p>&#8220;They said that we had to choose between cutting the deficit and keeping taxes low &#8211; or another way to put it, that in order to solve the deficit we had to raise taxes. I strongly disagree with those choices. Those are false choices. Tax relief fuels economic growth, and growth &#8211; when the economy grows, more tax revenues come to Washington. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened. It makes sense, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, no, it doesn&#8217;t make any sense at all. Bush, of course, is correct that tax revenues have risen over the last few years. This is normal. Except in certain extreme theoretical conditions, tax cuts cause revenues to fall, and tax hikes cause them to rise. The economy also can affect revenues. During an expansion, revenues can rise unusually fast, and during a recession, they can drop unusually fast. The latter is what happened following the first Bush tax cut. When Bush took office, tax revenues accounted for 19.8% of gross domestic product. After the tax cut, they collapsed to a low point of 16.3% &#8211; far lower than even the most pessimistic projection. Yes, revenues have risen from that low level, but they still haven&#8217;t recovered. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that revenues currently lag $200 billion behind the revenue growth you would normally find during a recovery. Now, Bush&#8217;s reply to that is to say that if it weren&#8217;t for his tax cuts, we would still be in a recession. Indeed, in the same Oct. 11 speech, he asserted, &#8220;I&#8217;m convinced that if we had raised taxes, it would cause there to be an economic decline, which would make it harder to balance the budget over the years.&#8221;  Because Bush can veto any tax hike, we can&#8217;t know for sure whether he&#8217;s right. But there&#8217;s another pretty good way to check that claim: Go back to the last time there was a major tax hike. That was in 1993. Just about every major elected Republican predicted the 1993 tax hike would slow down the economy, probably cause a recession and cause revenues to decline. Instead, they boomed, rising from 17.5% of GDP when Bill Clinton took office to 19.8% when he left. Republicans say Clinton just benefited from a good economy. Of course he did. That&#8217;s the point.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark argues:<br />
<blockquote>supply-side economics has been misused and misrepresented to suit political ends and that has tarnished its reputation, something that could have been avoided if those &#8220;real economists&#8221; who didn&#8217;t speak out strongly against claims made on behalf of the theory that were clearly wrong or wishful thinking at best &#8230; My objection comes when people dismiss the demand side entirely.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, President Bush is abusing Keynesian demand side economics.  His claim seems to be that aggregate demand will be inadequate to maintain full employment unless we make his fiscal irresponsibility permanent.  Does any real economist not find this claim laughable?</p>
