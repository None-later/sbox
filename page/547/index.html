<p>Both the Senate and the House have passed the big $700 billion bailout (actually now larded up to $800+ billion) to save the “financial system” from complete collapse. This is to supplement the various actions taken by the Fed and the SEC to shore up financial institutions, including halting short selling of hundreds of corporations and the creation of an alphabet soup of lending windows to “provide liquidity” to troubled institutions.</p>
<p>Much has been made of the fact that if nothing is done, the markets could come crashing down. Having watched some of the House floor debate this evening in my Berlin apartment thanks to the wonders of live-streaming from C-SPAN via the intertubes, I heard this argument over and over again from many members of the House. The big drop on Monday was cited as an example many times  as a sign of impending doom if nothing is done. Of course, all of this is especially ironic given that the markets took a huge nosedive as soon as the House passed the bill.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is no doubt that  a 1929-style crash would have an incredible impact upon the economy. But for whom in our society would a market crash have the most direct impact upon?</p>
<p>I found the answer to this question via the <a href="http://www.epi.org/">Economic Policy Institute</a> in their report titled <a href="http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/tabfig.html">The State of Working America 2006/2007</a>. They have a table which lists <a href="http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/tabfig/05/SWA06_Tab5.10.jpg">the concentration of stock ownership by income level</a> from the year 2004, which I found particularly interesting. I decided to make a figure that illustrates some of the data from this table:<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SOaX_FfK5tI/AAAAAAAAAQE/kJd9rwaJoU4/s1600-h/stock+ownership+and+income.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SOaX_FfK5tI/AAAAAAAAAQE/kJd9rwaJoU4/s400/stock+ownership+and+income.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>This shows that the 2.5% of the population that makes more that $250,000 a year own 44% of the shares on Wall St. Another way to look at it is that the 16.1% of the population that makes more than $100,000 per year own 73.2% of all shares. The rest of the 83.9% making less than $100,000 per year only own 26.8% of all the shares. The 57.2% of the population making less than $50, 000 own a paltry 9.2% of all shares.</p>
<p>To reiterate, many in Congress who supported the bailout package admitted that this needed to be passed in order to prevent a crash on Wall St. My guess is that allowing corporations to offload toxic assets onto the backs of taxpayers will certainly ease the strain on those corporations balance sheets. But do keep in mind, going forward, just who among stands to benefit the most in this &#8220;transaction&#8221;.</p>

<p>Prefatory Note: I wrote this several hours ago, but we had enough great posts this morning from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/whats-wrong-with-economic-theory-as.html">Robert</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/employment-situation.html">Spencer</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/few-questions-about-taxes.html">cactus</a>, and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/national-childrens-study.html">rdan</a> that I scheduled it instead of posting directly.  In the interim, the House approved the second bailout bill, which I am already <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-not-to-build-bailout-proposal.html">on record as opposing</a>, for reasons similar to those of YouNotSneaky!:<br />
<blockquote>So after voting &#8220;no&#8221; before, enough lawmakers might now vote &#8220;yes&#8221; on the new bailout plan because:</p>
<p>1. Mental health provisions in insurance plans.<br />2. State and local sales tax deductions.<br />3. Subsidies to rural counties<br />4. Relief for victims of natural disasters<br />5. Business tax breaks<br />6. Energy subsidies</p>
<p>&#8230;[W]hat 1-6 above have in common is that</p>
<p>THEY HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE FINANCIAL CRISIS!!!!!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>So, just for the record, I&#8217;m not posting this now out of &#8220;sour grapes.&#8221;  Just so that we have a record of <strong>why</strong> the bailout was a bad idea to begin with.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>There are conditionals I could put around that, but, really, why bother?  I read the press releases, and quick-skimmed through the bailout bill itself on Monday, trusted Paul Krugman&#8217;s &#8220;hold your nose and support it&#8221; analysis, and hoped for the best.</p>
<p>I forgot Daniel Davies&#8217;s Three Laws.  (Well, actually, I didn&#8217;t, but I hoped Chris Dodd&#8217;s efforts weren&#8217;t in vain.)  I forgot that the only exception to the &#8220;left the Bush Administration with a positive reputation intact&#8221; rule was Douglas Holtz-Eakin, (who just waited until he joined the presumptive Next Administration to go into the tank).</p>
<p>But I forgot the fundamental rule of economics: mechanism design has to be done well, or the idea will just be economic theory that &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/whats-wrong-with-economic-theory-as.html">depend[s] on assumptions which no one claims are approximately valid</a>.&#8221;**</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s review the assumptions under which the bill made at least some form of sense:
<ol>
<li>There was only going to be $250B taken in the first round, which would (by Paulson&#8217;s own description) provide financial until the next Congress was in place and could readdress the issue.</li>
<li>There would be oversight so that the Secretary of the Treasury (Paulson [GS], Gramm [UBS], etc.) couldn&#8217;t just reward his friends and punish his enemies.</li>
<li>The bill required <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/tarp-draft.html">equity compensation for overpriced securities</a>. (Not a great deal, but a gain from a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.)</li>
<li>The bill included changes to the compensation model that (let&#8217;s be nice) encouraged risk-taking where the bill came due on the next watch.</li>
<li>The compensation changes were also supposed to ensure that the current leadership—the people who drove these companies to the point of insolvency, that is—would not receive the monies and just pay themselves bonuses all out of proportion to performance.</li>
<li>There was never going to be a direct $700B economic gain from the stimulus package. That the proposal came out of Treasury told us that.  Some of the monies were going to go to &#8220;shoring up&#8221; firms that didn&#8217;t need it.</li>
<li>Even with that, monies that did get allocated optimally would have a multiplier effect, so you should get more than $700B in stimulus from them alone. (<a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/how-to-think-ab.html">Brad DeLong estimated $500B</a>, but that was based on E(loss) around $100B.  Even his worst case—$400B loss—would imply an $875B economic gain even in the event of a $700B government loss.  It&#8217;s not good budgeting, but it is a stimulus)</li>
</ol>
<p>That was the bill as presented.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/09/mussolini-style-corporatism-in-action.html">Yves Smith discovered the reality</a>, and, while I&#8217;m late to the party, I&#8217;ll join the piling-on:<br />
<blockquote>1. The tranching is a mere formality, and the Treasury boys as much as said so. They could take the $700 billion max as soon as the bill has passed,</p>
<p>2. However, they do not plan any action immediately, will wait a couple of weeks. They want to focus their efforts on stronger companies but also made noise about protecting the financial system. This, by the way, is the Japanese convoy system all over.</p>
<p>3. There seemed to be a lot of tap dancing about what price they will pay for assets and no straight answer about their policy on warrants. They did say that if the amount sold was greater than $100 million, they would take warrants. FYI, the current draft allows them to pay up to the price at which the assets were initially booked (yikes) . I wonder if this is obfuscation, if they have an idea of what the plan to do but will not admit it in any public forum.</p>
<p>4. As the person who listened to the call stressed, DealBreaker wasn&#8217;t clear on the bifurcated process. If you come to the Treasury and you are in trouble, you get reamed. Bear/AIG style treatment, execs probably fired. But if you participate on a voluntary basis, the intent is to make it very user friendly. That is consistent with Paulson&#8217;s position during the negotiations.</p>
<p>5. The exec comp provisions sound like a joke, They DO NOT affect existing contracts, they affect only contracts entered into during the two years of the authority of this program and then affect only golden parachutes. More detail on that point, but I don&#8217;t need more detail to get the drift of the gist.</p></blockquote>
<p>and that reform to executive compensation only exists for the <em>official</em> time of the program:<br />
<blockquote>Market mechanism: if sell over $300M into fund, some exec comp limits<br />come with it. For 2 years, the firm could not enter into NEW contracts<br />including golden parachute, for involuntary departure. And lose some<br />deductibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that undermines completely assumptions 1-5 above, leaving us with a poorly-targeted bill that does nothing to address the credit crunch (in a positive way, that is; negative implications discussed below the fold).</p>
<p>Ms. Smith later noted that <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/10/bailout-bill-to-make-money-market.html">her readers argue, probably correctly, it will make things worse</a> [numbering added to emphasize sequential nature of events]:<br />
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Fed as only lender, in an attempt to keep the financial system from imploding;</li>
<li>TARP needed to keep Fed balance sheet intact so that it can continue as only lender;</li>
<li>Treasury will need to significantly increase the amount of Ts (public money) auctioned to fund TARP;</li>
<li>Panic serves to encourage T. buyers, especially for bills;</li>
<li>This represents a liquidity trap: TARP recipients of Ts will hoard cash to buy Ts: rinse and repeat.</li>
<li>This results in drying up of lending to corporations/crowding out private capital &#8211; no new credit lines.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And that has become <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/10/breakingviews-bailout-bill-to-worsen.html">the groundswell opinion</a>, <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/10/credit-crunch-worsens-libor-spikes.html">with which the market appears to agree</a>.</p>
<p>So, even initially, we were left with a stimulus package that won&#8217;t save any firms, will support those who don&#8217;t need it, may well remove liquidity from the market at a time when it is desperately needed, and where none of the reforms that would ensure that this wouldn&#8217;t happen again.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing left.  Follow the DeLong/<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122282719885793047.html">Phelps</a> recommendation and nationalize the lot.</p>
<p>*Its not, by the way, that I&#8217;m not still sick.  It&#8217;s that when you can&#8217;t tell whether the character on the page is a dot, a carat (^), or a tilde (~), it&#8217;s time to take a break.  Which has mean reading some blogs that didn&#8217;t fit the bandwidth a few days ago, with Firefox set to an increased text size.<br />**I could pick nits here and note that many of the theories can be considered valid if they are trivial, but is that really an argument <em>for</em> theory?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Near the end of each month the Treasury Dept releases Trust Fund Reports giving balances to the penny for the previous month. By comparing these balances to the projection in the Annual Reports we can get a rough idea of how Social Security is doing year to date. This year&#8217;s Report was released on October 2. Two caveats:<br />One, these numbers are not seasonally adjusted and I couldn&#8217;t tell you the relative impact on total wages of summer employment vs harvest vs holiday. Each are marked by the entry of temporary workers into the system.<br />Two, Social Security collects FICA on your total check right up to the point you hit the annual cap at which point they stop collecting at all. For example if you have a salary of $200,000 per year you would see full deductions for Jan to Jun, a small deduction for July and nothing thereafter. This should make for the earlier parts of the year seeing relatively higher collections than the latter. But once again I can&#8217;t quantify the effect.</p>
<p>So this is an imperfect tool. But it is what we have. So lets have some numbers. (Warning we have a kind of disappointing result, Social Security not liking an economy where U6 is sitting at 11% <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/the-track-record/">Krugman: The Track Record</a>.)</p>
<p>The web page for all the Trust Fund Reports (including Medicare HI, Highways etc) is <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/tfmp/tfmp.htm">Trust Fund Monthly Reports</a> While generally Social Security is reported for convenience as having a single Trust Fund which will go to depletion (or not) in some future year (currently 2041), in reality there are two Trust Funds which are legally distinct and can have different levels of solvency and so different projected depletion dates. The larger by far (about 10 to 1) is the OAS (Old Age Survivors) TF. Its report can be found at <a href="ftp://ftp.publicdebt.treas.gov/dfi/tfmb/dfifo0608.pdf">OAS Monthly TF Report</a>. Its smaller companion the DI (Disability Insurance) TF can be found at <a href="ftp://ftp.publicdebt.treas.gov/dfi/tfmb/dfifd0608.pdf">DI Monthly TF Report</a> These can then be cross checked against the relevant tables in the 2008 Report:<br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_SRest.html#248224">Table IV.A1.—Operations of the OASI Trust Fund, Calendar Years 2003-17 [Amounts in billions]</a> and <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_SRest.html#251965">Table IV.A2.—Operations of the DI Trust Fund, Calendar Years 2003-17 [Amounts in billions]</a><br />OAS::Opening balance//Projected year end balance-Intermediate Cost//Y-O-Y Increase//Year end balance-Low Cost//Y-O-Y increase-Low Cost<br />$2.023 trillion // $2.216 trillion //$193 billion// $2.221 trillion// $198 billion</p>
<p>DI::Opening balance//Projected year end balance-Intermediate Cost//Y-O-Y Increase//Year end balance-Low Cost//Y-O-Y increase-Low Cost<br />$214.9 billion//$218.7 billion//$3.8 billion//$221.3 billion// $6.4 billion.</p>
<p>June 30th/Mid-year: OAS $2.140 trillion// DI $220 billion</p>
<p>Aug 31st/Two-thirds: OAS $2.164 trillion// DI $219 billion</p>
<p>I had some calculations up but they all got garbled in my head so I deleted them. Bottom line 2008 is shaping up to be a kind of sucky year for Social Security. What was a decent picture for OAS mid-year now is kind of dim, it is unlikely that we will even hit Intermediate Cost projections. What was a really bright picture for DI is now less shiny, from June to August the balance actually shrank, if that continues at the same rate it too will fail to hit IC projections.</p>
<p>Which just goes to show the ultimate truth about Social Security, it prospers in good times, it shares the pain in bad as receipts react to covered employment and real wages. (We have a parallel here with the late seventies, a reform was put in in I believe 1977, it didn&#8217;t fare well when stagflation simultaneously choked off revenue while boosting cost. The result was a new crisis and a need for a bigger reform in 1983).</p>

<p>Paul Krugman <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/opinion/03krugman.html?_r=1&#038;ref=opinion&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;oref=slogin">presents the optimistic version</a>*:<br />
<blockquote>The House will probably vote on Friday on the latest version of the $700 billion bailout plan — originally the Paulson plan, then the Paulson-Dodd-Frank plan, and now, I guess, the Paulson-Dodd-Frank-Pork plan (it’s been larded up since the House rejected it on Monday). I hope that it passes, simply because we’re in the middle of a financial panic, and another no vote would make the panic even worse. But that’s just another way of saying that the economy is now hostage to the Treasury Department’s blunders.</p>
<p>For the fact is that the plan on offer is a stinker — and inexcusably so. The financial system has been under severe stress for more than a year, and there should have been carefully thought-out contingency plans ready to roll out in case the markets melted down. Obviously, there weren’t: the Paulson plan was clearly drawn up in haste and confusion. And Treasury officials have yet to offer any clear explanation of how the plan is supposed to work, probably because they themselves have no idea what they’re doing.</p>
<p>Despite this, as I said, I hope the plan passes, because otherwise we’ll probably see even worse panic in the markets. But at best, the plan will buy some time to seek a real solution to the crisis.</p></blockquote>
<p>It won&#8217;t be that good.</p>
<p>More later, but the relevant quote of the week comes from <a href="http://www.breakingviews.com/2008/10/02/Tarp's%20economic%20implications.aspx?sg=breakingstories">Martin Hutchinson at Breaking Views</a> (h/t <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/10/breakingviews-bailout-bill-to-worsen.html">Yves Smith</a>):<br />
<blockquote>Herbert Hoover’s Reconstruction Finance Corporation of 1931-32, which made loans to politically connected companies, didn’t do much to alleviate the Great Depression. An equivalent amount of welfare handed out through the “Veterans’ Bonus”, which Hoover opposed, might have boosted consumption and stabilised the economy more quickly.</p></blockquote>
<p>*Or, if you prefer, the von Clausewitz version, &#8220;Any positive action, <em>even if ultimately wrong</em>&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>So much for Sarah Palin&#8217;s claim that Republican tax cuts create jobs. In the post  WW II era every Democratic President has left office with a lower unemployment rate than they inherited from their predecessor while only one Republican president left office with a lower unemployment rate than they inherited.  That was Ronald Reagan, but his first term still holds the record for the highest average unemployment rate of any post &#8211; WW II four year Presidential term.</p>
<p>George Bush inherited a 3.9% unemployment rate and the results of all his tax cuts has been a rise in the unemployment rate to 6.1%, so far.  By contrast Bill Clinton inherited a 7.4% unemployment rate and with his prudent fiscal policy left Bush a 3.9% unemployment rate.<br />Leave it to Team Bush to be the only American President to throw a war that failed to stimulate the economy.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SOYaalFehqI/AAAAAAAAAiw/SHKszKF9Mjk/s1600-h/Clipboard04.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SOYaalFehqI/AAAAAAAAAiw/SHKszKF9Mjk/s320/Clipboard04.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Both the household survey and payroll data showed declines in employment last month and the only sector to show employment gains was government.  The employment data strongly supports the conclusion that the economy is in a recession</p>

This implies that for third quarter real GDP growth to be positive productivity growth will have to exceed 2%.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SOYYmeASm5I/AAAAAAAAAiQ/TK3fZIXokPc/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SOYYmeASm5I/AAAAAAAAAiQ/TK3fZIXokPc/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Finally, average hourly earnings growth continues to slow and with the drop in hours worked average weekly wage growth actually fell.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/Pages/default.aspx">The National Children’s Study</a></p>
<blockquote><p> will examine the effects of environmental influences on the health and development of 100,000 children across the United States, following them from before birth until age 21. The goal of the Study is to improve the health and well-being of children.</p>
<p>Watch this video and learn more about the Study.</p>
<p>The Study defines “environment” broadly, taking a number of natural and man-made environmental, biological, genetic, and psychosocial factors into account. By studying children through their different phases of growth and development, researchers will be better able to understand the role these factors have on health and disease. Findings from the Study will be made available as the research progresses, making potential benefits known to the public as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the National Children’s Study will be one of the richest research efforts geared towards studying children’s health and development and will form the basis of child health guidance, interventions, and policy for generations to come. For more details on the Study, see the Study Overview.</p>
<p>The National Children’s Study is led by a consortium of federal partners including: the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (including the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Hopefully a new trend in researching the overall health of our children is forthcoming next year.  This study promises to finally tackle some of the broader issues instead of the laser like narrowness of other research.  Many initiatives died over the last eight years.</p>

<p>A Few Questions About Taxes</p>
<p>In the past few years, if you pointed out that the Bush tax cuts went primarily to those with high incomes, the response from the right was essentially this:</p>
<p>a.  those with highest income got the biggest tax cut because they pay the most in taxes<br />b.  the high income folks are the ones that do the most for the economy and create the most jobs</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8780c35e-7e91-11dd-b1af-000077b07658.html">Financial Times</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the aftermath of the US Treasury’s decision to seize control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, critics have hit at lax oversight of the mortgage companies.</p>
<p>The dominant theme has been that Congress let the two government-sponsored enterprises morph into a creature that eventually threatened the US financial system. Mike Oxley will have none of it.</p>
<p>Instead, the Ohio Republican who headed the House financial services committee until his retirement after mid-term elections last year, blames the mess on ideologues within the White House as well as Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>The critics have forgotten that the House passed a GSE reform bill in 2005 that could well have prevented the current crisis, says Mr Oxley, now vice-chairman of Nasdaq.</p>
<p>He fumes about the criticism of his House colleagues. “All the handwringing and bedwetting is going on without remembering how the House stepped up on this,” he says. “What did we get from the White House? We got a one-finger salute.”</p>
<p>The House bill, the 2005 Federal Housing Finance Reform Act, would have created a stronger regulator with new powers to increase capital at Fannie and Freddie, to limit their portfolios and to deal with the possibility of receivership.</p>
<p>Mr Oxley reached out to Barney Frank, then the ranking Democrat on the committee and now its chairman, to secure support on the other side of the aisle. But after winning bipartisan support in the House, where the bill passed by 331 to 90 votes, the legislation lacked a champion in the Senate and faced hostility from the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Adamant that the only solution to the problems posed by Fannie and Freddie was their privatisation, the White House attacked the bill. Mr Greenspan also weighed in, saying that the House legislation was worse than no bill at all.</p>
<p>“We missed a golden opportunity that would have avoided a lot of the problems we’re facing now, if we hadn’t had such a firm ideological position at the White House and the Treasury and the Fed,” Mr Oxley says.</p>
<p>When Hank Paulson joined the administration as Treasury secretary in 2006 he sent emissaries to Capitol Hill to explore the possibility of reaching a compromise, but to no avail.</p></blockquote>
<p>To date, the bailouts do not seem to address the housing bubble fundamentals.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I have a very low opinion of economic theory.  I think that its survival is the result of a bait and switch where the core principles (roughtly Nash equilibrium) can&#8217;t be proven false, because they have no implications, and, given the fact that they have not been proven false, economists attempt to convince people of the joint implications of the core principles and further assumptions which are known to be false.  Fortunately, very few people pay much attention to economic theory.</p>
<p>To continue the diatribe, the implications of economic theory as presented by right wing economists are the implications of models which are about 50 years old now.  They depend on assumptions which no one claims are approximately valid.  In particular, the traditional application to finance of economic theory, that is general equilibrium theory, (generically) gives the standard results only if markets are complete &#8212; that is there is a contingent claim for every conceivable contingency (including say this pays 1 unit of numeraire good if it is snowing on Mars or if Robert Waldmann stubs his toe between 6:55 EST of October 3 2008 and 7 EST).</p>
<p>With incomplete markets, the market outcome is generically (that is except for a set of economies with measure zero) constrained Pareto inefficient (that means that there are legal restrictions on peoples positions in financial markets which make everyone better off).  </p>
<p>Also, there is no claim based on economic theory that financial market prices reflect fundamentals.  A large set of general equilibrium economies *with complete markets* have multiple equilibria.  Which equilibrium occurs is not determined by fundamentals (tastes and technology).  With incomplete markets payoff irrelevant signals (sunspots) can affect prices in general (I think generically).</p>
<p>The conclusions of economic theory as presented by many or perhaps most economists do not follow from current economic theory, but rather from the 50 year old efforts at mathematical economic theory.</p>
<p>Thus the New York Times Op-ed page is not to be blamed for publishing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/opinion/01buchanan.html?_r=1&#038;scp=7&#038;sq=october+01+2008&#038;st=nyt&#038;oref=slogin">an op-ed full of false claims about economic theory written by Mark Buchanan a physicist</a>.  I won&#8217;t excerpt, read it if you want.  My objections after the jump.</p>
<p>Bachman has no idea what he is talking about.</p>
<p>First he has no idea of what economists mean when we say &#8220;equilibrium&#8221;.  He just assumes that we mean stable steady state (which is what we used to mean 50 years ago).  Now we mean Nash equilibrium  or Walrasian General equilibrium which is nothing of the kind.   He should check on recent developments in general equilbrium theory in the past 30 years.  He will find the word &#8220;sunspot&#8221;.  He will find that general equilbrium theorists argue that there are &#8220;equilibria&#8221; in which market prices jump around with no relevant news (based on irrelevant news that has nothing to do with tastes or technology).  That is, the view of general equilibrium theorists is the exact opposite of the view Buchanan attributes to them.</p>
<p>He will also note that general equilibrium theorists conclude that market equilbria are generically not constrained Pareto efficient &#8212; the theorists who showed that are Herakles Polimarchakas and John Geanokoplos (hey where did I just read that name ?).  </p>
<p>Finally the bit about how economists don&#8217;t use computer simulations is, if possible, even more wrong than the rest of the op-ed.   It is like saying economists refuse to use mathematics or have no use for the theory of statistics.   </p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that Buchanan demonstrates complete ignorance about what economic theorists have been doing in the, depending on the paragraph of the op-ed, past 30 to 50 years.</p>
<p>By now I&#8217;m tempted to just post my explanation of why I won&#8217;t post.  I think I will.</p>
<p>On the other hand, while Buchanan doesn&#8217;t know anything about current economic theory, I think he does have a sense about how economic theory affects the political debate.  There is a general view that, according to economic theorists, laissez faire is the best policy.  Pro-market politicians are a bit reassured by this and pro-regulation and egalitarian politicians probably think they are fighting against the false prevailing economic theory.  In fact,  many economists argue that economic theory shows (if they are delusional about the scientific standing of economic theory) or suggests that the market is socially efficient.  This is just not true at all.  In particular someone who confuses &#8220;Pareto efficient&#8221; and &#8220;efficient&#8221; can claim this about markets with rational agents, perfect competition and *complete markets*.  It is hard to explain what complete markets would look like, because an economy with complete markets is so totally unlike the real world.  No one has ever argued that markets are approximately complete and no general equilibrium theorist has ever argued that this is a matter of less than critical importance.</p>
<p>The problem is, I think, that when they talk to non economists, many economists pretend that traditional economic theory is a good approximation to reality.  By &#8220;traditional&#8221; I mean 50 year old.  The fact that the conclusions are the result of strong assumptions made for tractability and are known to not hold without these assumptions is irrelevant.  In the case of financial market equilibrium, the assumptions are not just the core assumptions of rationality and old assumptions of perfect competition but the totally crazy assumption of complete markets.</p>
<p>Once a model has been put in textbooks, it becomes immortal invulnerable not only to the data (which can prove it is not a true statement about the world but no one ever thought it was) but also to further theoretical analysis.</p>
<p>Buchanan should have talked more to Geanakoplos before shooting his keyboard off.  The Times should have checked claims about current economic theory with an economist before printing them, but I think the worse problem is that economists who are also libertarian ideologues are lying about the current state of economic theory, not only its very weak scientific standing, but the fact that, even if it were all absolutely true, their policy recommendations do not at all follow from current economic theory.</p>
