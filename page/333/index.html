                                <p>The 2010 Social Security Report is due out any day now and I thought I could lay some groundwork for a number based discussion of its implications. Starting with changes to the 75 year projection over time.</p>
<p>1996-2.19%<br />1997-2.23%<br />1998-2.19%<br />1999-2.07%<br />2000-1.87%<br />2001-1.86%<br />2002-1.87%<br />2003-1.92%<br />2004-1.89%<br />2005-1.92% <br />2006-2.02%<br />2007-1.96%<br />2008-1.70%<br />2009-2.01%<br />2010-??<br />Each Report Year the Trustees give an estimate of how much payroll tax would have to go up immediately to deliver Long Term Actuarial Balance, meaning full payment of scheduled benefits and a Trust Fund with a one-year reserve at the end of the 75th year. In this post I want to explore the reasons why this number can go either up or down over the course of a single year, sometimes in a pretty dramatic manner, how can one Report Year whip the tail by as much as +/- 10%? Geekiness under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The first thing to understand is that the bias in this number by rights should be upwards for two reasons. Consider 1998, in point of fact we did nothing in the faces of a 2.23% actuarial gap from the previous year, meaning that extra dollars were not collected and so contributed neither principal or interest to the Trust Fund, all things being equal this should have added to the cost of an ultimate fix, because as &#8216;everyone knows&#8217; the longer we wait the more any fix is going to cost. Well the numbers show that not to be true, in the face of inactivity the total cost can actually go down, why that is to be explored a little later. The second cause for an upward bias is the result of the change in valuation  period, in 1998 what had been year 1, that is 1997 dropped off, and what had been year 76 became the new year 75 and so got included. And the Trustees tell us that change alone will add 0.06% to the gap. Meaning that if we were 100% confident in our modeling we would expect to see an uptick in that amount each and every year.</p>
<p>Well a single glance at this time/number series shows that we are not justified in that confidence, when people claim that the Trust Fund &#8216;will&#8217; run dry in 2037, what they mean knowingly or not is &#8216;if every bit of our methodology is correct and so too all of our economic and demographic assumptions about the future&#8217;. Well obviously we don&#8217;t know what is going to be happening in 75 years, or even 10 years. For that matter only a handful of people not named Baker or Schiller were predicting this years economy even 3 years ago.</p>
<p>This uncertainty is fully recognized by the professionals in the SSA Office of the Chief Actuary, a fact that is shown in three ways. First the numbers above are drawn from is known as the Intermediate Cost alternative, the OACT also provides a more optimistic Low Cost alternative, and a more pessimistic High Cost alternative to present a range of possible outcomes. Second the OACT doesn&#8217;t pretend to be able to predict future business cycles after the first ten years, instead all of their economic number series under all three alternatives settle out into what are called the Ultimate values, and finally the OACT shows its work in the form of Sensitivity analyses and Stochastic projections that show how those outcomes vary in response to changes to individual variables and in light of past variations, all of which are published in the Annual Report.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my first conclusion here: Infinite Future is Hooey. Given the probabilistic variation revealed even over the medium term and particularly given that an outcome that shows the system fully funded over the 75 year period (which is the result of Low Cost), and given the substantial uncertainties in even year over year projections as revealed above trying to influence policy by an &#8216;Unfunded Liability&#8217; over the &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217; is not just misguided, it is thoroughly dishonest. Particularly given the time series.</p>
<p>In 1997 Social Security could still reasonably be said to be in crisis, the 2.23% projected actuarial gap had been steadily increasing over the few years before just as you would expect from a crisis left unaddressed, the fact that the system had finally reached a Trust Fund ratio of 100 in 1993 and so met the short term test did not mean the whole program was out of the woods, as long as the actuarial gap was ticking upwards there was good reason to &#8216;Save Social Security First&#8217;, after all under then current projections the Trust Fund would go to zero in 2029.</p>
<p>Well a funny thing happened, starting in 1998 the gap, even in the face of inactivity started to drop, in the first year just a little but in 1999 and 2000 by a lot, 10% improvement per year in a 75 year outlook. And it was in response to this that Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot published <a target="_blank" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a> and I developed my own plan for Social Security which I cleverly dubbed &#8220;Nothing&#8221;. In 2000 Greenspan was happily assuring us that via the miracle of the Great Moderation we had conquered the business cycle and we could enjoy 3% productivity and 4% Real GDP forever. Numbers that if correct were far better than the ones of Low Cost which showed Social Security vastly overfunded going forwards.</p>
<p>Which leads to a second conclusion. When it came to Social Security the Bush Administration was thoroughly dishonest from the start, they promoted their tax cuts based on a set of economic numbers that if they had actually come about would have saved Social Security along the way. Yet they willfully ignored the number series above and convened a Social Security Commission that still relied heavily on the rhetoric of crisis and &#8216;we can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8217;. Well the hell we couldn&#8217;t, the ways the projected numbers were moving during Bush&#8217;s first term there was positive evidence that a short term policy of &#8220;Nothing&#8221; was in fact optimal.</p>
<p>As noted at the outset the natural bias in this series in the face of inactivity is upwards due to theoretical taxes not collected in the previous year combined with the built in increase due to change in actuarial balance. Leaving aside the specific reasons for changes in projections from year to year the fact that four years of inactivity from the time Bush was elected in 2000 to his re-election only increased the actuarial gap by 0.02% and even at that was down by 0.03% from the previous year made the whole Social Security Tour of Spring 2005 itself throughly dishonest. These numbers show clearly why &#8220;There is No Crisis&#8221; was a relatively easy campaign to win, our side had the numbers.</p>
<p>Well except one. In 2003 a new measure of Social Security solvency suddenly appeared in the Reports, instead of measuring the payroll gap over the standard 75 year window, the Trustees would add a new number projecting Intermediate Cost over the Infinite Future Horizon. Now given the existing probability range over even the first 75 years and the rapid changes in outlook seen since 1997 this was more akin to witch magic than anything, but it produced a very useful number on its own. All of a sudden the President&#8217;s Men could point away from a number that was under 2% and on balance shrinking and to a number that was almost twice as high at 3.5%. And they needed a number that high and badly because of something I pointed out in an adage coined in 1997:</p>
<p>&#8220;If privatization is necessary, it won&#8217;t be possible. If privatization is possible, it won&#8217;t be necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>For movement Republicans the real Social Security crisis was that it existed in the first place. But due to its general popularity a head-on assault was thought politically impossible, so in order to sell their ideologically preferable system of Private Accounts they were forced to play the solvency crisis card, and to present the better returns on equities as being the key to the solution. Unfortunately for them there were three problems here. One their models assumed traditional returns on stocks, which in turn required growth rates in line with historical trends, which rates if sustained were significantly better than those projected under Intermediate Cost assumptions. Hence the ditty above. A secondary problem is that along side their ideological commitment to Private Accounts was their even stronger commitment to tax cuts which had been sold on claims that such cuts would boost productivity. If tax cuts had actually worked as advertised then Social Security would have been saved from crisis along the way. A third problem was structural, any move from traditional Pay-Go Social Security to self-funded Private Accounts had to somehow handle the transition costs. And there was no way to do that at a cost to the worker that would not exceed the 1.89% payroll gap. Which would reasonably lead an informed worker to ask &#8220;Exactly what is in this for me that I should take this extra risk when I could just except the tax increase and guarantee a 100% benefit?&#8221;</p>
<p>And there was no answer to that in 2005, even the use of a 3.5% Infinite Future number didn&#8217;t rescue the calculations, there was no numerically based challenge to the proven plan of &#8220;Nothing&#8221;. To see why we have to look a little deeper at the numbers and what I call &#8220;The Cost of Inactivity&#8221;.</p>
<p>In 2001 the process of actual shrinkage in actuarial gap stalled. There is some reason to believe that this stalling was deliberately engineered so as not to make the sales job for private accounts even harder than it was. People in a position to know on both sides of the issue insist that deliberate manipulation of the numbers in the Report is impossible, but both Prof. Rosser and an originally skeptical Arne took a hard look at the internals of the data tables and numerically if not practically the case is pretty solid. But either way a steady number as seen from 2001-2005 is an irrefutable argument for &#8220;Nothing&#8221; for two reasons. One the same performance numbers that drove down and then kept steady the actuarial gap also moved the date of Trust Fund exhaustion out in time, between 1997 and 2005 the date of depletion had been pushed out from 2029 to 2042. Not only had that date been moving at more than a year per year, suggesting that the event itself would never happen, it was being pushed out past the point of maximum Boomer demographic impact, a close look at the numbers show that the thirty or so years after mid-century will be relatively easy on Social Security as it handles a cohort of Gen-Xers that is numerically smaller than the Boomers that will have moved off the stage and the still working Millennials behind. In 2005 the case for simply waiting out &#8216;Crisis&#8217; was excellent. Because every year of inactivity meant the functional equivalent of a tax cut in the amount of the fix not applied.</p>
<p>Well the case for &#8220;Nothing&#8221; got more problematic with the gyrating numbers from 2006-2009 and what is likely to be a disappointing number for 2010. Which is why I moved off &#8220;Nothing&#8221; to support the &#8220;NW Plan&#8221;. But in any event it is important that all decision making on this be driven by the numbers and not by slogans. And that means digging into the data tables and not relying on the MSM to bring you the news. Hopefully this post will help you cut through the spin certain to be coming down the road in the next couple of weeks after Report release.</p>

Well,<br />sometimes these employment reports make me feel like one of those crewmen.</p>
<p>Yes, the employment situation has quit deteriorating, and there are encouraging details within the report.  But the overall rebound in the economy and the employment situation is one of being  stuck in the doldrums.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X7jPPs-hI/AAAAAAAABFw/ig5eWQglMsI/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X7jPPs-hI/AAAAAAAABFw/ig5eWQglMsI/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />After the February snowstorms caused monthly hours worked and the index of aggregate hours worked to tick down,  this month showed the expected snap back in hours worked. We are now looking at the first quarter hours worked index rising at a 1.8% annual rate, the first quarterly gain since the recession began. With continued strong productivity gains this implies that first quarter real GDP growth is almost certain to exceed consensus expectations.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X7PglHDUI/AAAAAAAABFo/KAyZ8cM6DxA/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X7PglHDUI/AAAAAAAABFo/KAyZ8cM6DxA/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>However, much of the improvement in the hours worked index was offset by a drop in average hours earning.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X7yuuCucI/AAAAAAAABF4/rr3uPcxFTE0/s1600/Clipboard03.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X7yuuCucI/AAAAAAAABF4/rr3uPcxFTE0/s320/Clipboard03.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Consequently, we are seeing a significant gain in average weekly earnings.  But it is not enough  to generate large gains in real income growth on the positive side, nor is it enough to scare the Fed into premature tightening on the negative side.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X687_EXcI/AAAAAAAABFg/UhLuJgueoD8/s1600/Clipboard01.jpg"><br /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X8ukNeVTI/AAAAAAAABGQ/2eA9qz9Jwbw/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X8ukNeVTI/AAAAAAAABGQ/2eA9qz9Jwbw/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />One of the encouraging details buried deep within the report is the large improvements in the diffusing index &#8212; another leading index of stronger employment.  But we have now seen several of these  leading indicators be positive for several months. It is time for them to actually lead to some strong employment numbers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2010/03/three-potential-explanations-for-the-continued-fall-in-us-savings-rate.html">Edward Harrison at Credit Writedowns</a> is theorizing why the saving rate is falling when it should be rising, as households scram to deleverage their balance sheets. My reaction to this is twofold: first this is a meaningless exercise; but second, and worse yet, there&#8217;s likely something very &#8220;unhealthy&#8221; going on here.</p>
<p>Meaningless: The BEA conducts a <a href="http://bea.gov/national/pdf/NIPAhandbookch1-4.pdf">comprehensive revision of the NIPA tables</a> every five years. The saving rate is usually revised upward, and by a fair amount, as was the case for most of the 2000s.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7TFwfYqG-I/AAAAAAAAC-U/3YXS_k3j_Qo/s1600/saving_revised.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7TFwfYqG-I/AAAAAAAAC-U/3YXS_k3j_Qo/s320/saving_revised.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>So in &#8220;roughly&#8221; 5 years from 2009 (it&#8217;s not uniformly 5 years between each revision), you will see a higher saving rate than you do today. As I said <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2009/07/us-saving-rate-before-and-after-830-am.html">in July</a>, the<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;BEA has &#8220;found&#8221; that households have been in fact saving roughly 1% more of  their disposable income per quarter since 1995, 0.9% per quarter in  2008.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> They will &#8220;find&#8221; it again.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Unhealthy: But even if they don&#8217;t &#8220;find&#8221; much more than an average +1% a year, there&#8217;s probably something a bit more sinister and non-economic (i.e., in addition to the wealth, income, or substitution effects &#8211; see <a href="http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2010/03/three-potential-explanations-for-the-continued-fall-in-us-savings-rate.html">Edward Harrison&#8217;s post on this point</a>) going on here: non-market activity is rising. I haven&#8217;t seen a study to this point &#8211; if you have, please send me the link; I am very interested &#8211; but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if non-market income has creptup lately, i.e., through the informal labor force.</p>
<p>With an <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EMRATIO?cid=12">employment-to-population ratio a shocking 58.5% in February</a> (it was 63.4% as recently as March 2007), there&#8217;s got to be a growing supply of labor that is &#8220;working under the table&#8221; just to get by. This non-market income would flow through the spending accounts but not the income accounts. Therefore, you have official consumption going up with official income (doesn&#8217;t include non-market income) stalling, which reduces the saving rate.</p>

<p>Whether there <a href="http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/6307#more">is or is not a near peak</a> in either of these two metals (copper and gold), we<br />should expect to see prices inexorably climb. The reason? The enormous<br />appetite of China for raw materials. However we look at it, China&#8217;s<br />ponderous entry onto the world stage has been the most significant economic<br />event in the last 50 years.  (<em>Rdan here</em>&#8230;<em>it looks like copper prices are driven mostly by demand to date according to the charts, not lack of supply reserves)<br /></em><br />Now the question is: How will this affect the U.S. and Europe? Certainly,<br />there will be a race to secure raw materials, especially those whose supply<br />is clearly and perhaps measurably finite. Furthermore, this race comes at a<br />time when the U.S. and Europe are not exactly flush with cash.<br />Economically, I would say that this one of the biggest stories out there.<br />Problems such as Greece and U.S. debt must be placed in this context.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s massive workforce has been deflationary in terms of the cost of<br />labor. On the other hand, the actual cost of resources will climb, both<br />because of dwindling supplies as well as the increasing cost to bring them<br />into the production stream.</p>
<p>Stormy asks.</p>
<p><em>Rdan here:</em>  I found the following in the comments from Jon and <a href="http://www.theoildrum.com/user/Gail%20the%20Actuary">Gail the actuary</a> especially relevant for us novices:<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><strong>Jon says:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;One gets a much better picture of the situation by actually reading the reports put out by the USGS. From the 2010 Minerals Yearbook <a href="http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2010-coppe.pdf">section on copper</a>:<br /><em>World Resources</em>:<br />
<blockquote>Recent assessments of copper resources indicated 550 million tons of copper remaining in identified and undiscovered resources in the United States8 and 1.3 billion tons of copper in discovered, mined, and undiscovered resources in the Andes Mountains of South America.9 A preliminary assessment indicates that global land-based resources exceed 3 billion tons. Deep-sea nodules were estimated to contain 700 million tons of copper.</p>
<p>Substitutes:<br />Aluminum substitutes for copper in power cables, electrical equipment, automobile radiators, and cooling and refrigeration tube; titanium and steel are used in heat exchangers; optical fiber substitutes for copper in telecommunications applications; and plastics substitute for copper in water pipe, drain pipe, and plumbing fixtures.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peak production and peak demand will be determined ultimately by peak price.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Gail says:</strong></p>
<p>&#8221; It seems to me we have a lot of different things going on with copper:</p>
<p>1. Extraction is very energy dependent, so cost of extraction tends to vary with the price of oil.</p>
<p>2. Ores are getting to be of lower and lower quality.</p>
<p>3. Techniques for extraction are getting better over time, using less energy (one of the true forms of energy efficiency.)</p>
<p>4. Other metals can be substituted for copper, if the price gets high enough.</p>
<p>5. Economies around the world have been growing, generally pushing up the demand for metals.</p>
<p>6. Financial issues affect demand. The easier it is to get credit, the more building will be done, and the more copper will be needed. (This is true for other metals as well.) Peak credit will likely determine peak demand. (Or perhaps the limit will be determined by net energy available for uses such as mining.)</p>
<p>It seems to me that most of what we are seeing can be explained by these factors.</p>
<p>What we see in the world production graph is continuous growth in copper use, as world economies grow. It may be that one area of the world grows faster than another, as one area reaches lower ore concentration, or has lower labor costs. I would expect costs and production to vary with the six things listed above.</p>
<p>It seems to me too, that the when the peak occurs and the shape of the downside of the curve, is likely to be defined by the above factors&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>(<em>Rdan and re-cycling efforts over the globe&#8230;.). Anyway, a neglected part of the puzzle at AB to consider.<br /></em></p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>And I could add honest definitions and honest framing to that.</p>
<p>In Dec 2005 three former staffers to Bill Clinton, John McCain and GW Bush respectively released the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/jeffreyliebman/lms_nonpartisan_plan_description.pdf">Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick Non-Partisan Social Security Reform Plan (9 pg PDF)</a> or LMS. The authors proposed a package of changes to Social Security comprised of a 1.5% across the board payroll tax increase, an adjustment of the payroll gap back to the 90% level (it had drifted down to 84%) for the equivalent of another 1.0% of payroll, and adjustment in retirement age scored at 0.62% of payroll, and a change in indexing of initial benefits that scored at 2.08% of payroll for a total worker financed &#8216;fix&#8217; of 5.2% of payroll. Interestingly enough in that year the total 75 year actuarial gap was scored at 1.92% of payroll, meaning that an immediate hike of that amount would deliver 100% of scheduled benefits over the 75 year window traditionally used to score Social Security solvency. So why a 5.2% solution to a problem scored 1.92%?</p>
<p>Well therein lies a tale, and an important one when we are faced with a so-called Deficits Commission whose leaders make it clear that Social Security is front and center, as workers and future retirees we owe it to ourselves to understand what problem &#8216;reformers&#8217; are actually addressing. Because LMS at least is not focused on retirement security, not at least in the dollars and cents sense. Much more under the fold. (It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to bring along your tin-foil hat).<br /><a name="more"></a><br />My first introduction to LMS came the summer before publication when co-author Prof. Andrew Samwick outlined it in a guest post at DeLong. In the course of discussion he casually claimed that the payroll gap was 3.5%. When in comments I asked &#8220;Whence 3.5% Samwick?&#8221; and pointed to the standard 1.92% 75 year number reported by the Trustees, both he, and by e-mail DeLong, informed me that he was referencing the gap projected over the Infinite Future Horizon and pointed to Table IV.B7 in the Report.  Well sure enough alongside the $3.5 trillion dollar 75 year gap was a $10.5 trillion Infinite Future one.</p>
<p>Well I had been reading and comparing Trustees Reports since 1997 and never heard of such a thing, was I just a sloppy reader? Well no, it turns out this particular measure was relatively new having been introduced with the 2003 Report. Why was it so introduced? And why should we prefer it to the previously satisfactory 75 year window? Well a tale within a tale. From the Report, bolding mine<br />
<blockquote>Consistent with practice since 1965, this report focuses on the 75-year period from 2003 to 2077 for the evaluation of the long-run financial status of the OASDI program on an open group basis (i.e., including both current and future participants). Table IV.B7 shows that the present value of open group unfunded obligations for the program over that period is $3.5 trillion. Some experts, however, have described the limitations of using a 75-year period. Overemphasis of summary measures (such as the actuarial balance and open group unfunded obligations) for the 75-year period can lead to incorrect perceptions and policy that fails to address sustainability.<br />In order to provide a fuller description of long-run unfunded obligations of the OASDI program, this section presents estimates of obligations that extend to the infinite horizon.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm, &#8220;some experts&#8221;, &#8220;incorrect perceptions&#8221;, &#8220;address sustainability&#8221;. What the heck is sustainability in context? Why should workers care? Got a name for any of those experts or an explanation of why an alternate perception that focuses on outcomes within our own lifetime and not on retirement of people not yet born is somehow &#8220;incorrect&#8221;? Why so? Well I suggest that the answer is that retirement security for current workers is simply not the focus of these unnamed &#8220;experts&#8221;, and that somehow the Trustees in 2003 rather silently adopted that same focus for reasons unstated.</p>
<p>Returning to LMS. In the description of the authors we get the following, once again bolding mine:<br />
<blockquote>Andrew Samwick is Professor of Economics and Director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Public Policy at Dartmouth College.  From 2003 to 2004, he was Chief Economist on the staff of President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, where his responsibilities included Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p> Well &#8220;responsibilities&#8221; is a broad term, but you would expect that an implicit change in the focus in Social Security from 75 year solvency to Infinite Future &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; might suggest the involvement of the CEA Chief Economist, and certainly Samwick qualified as an &#8220;expert&#8221;, but Prof Samwick has informed me personally that he was not in fact responsible for this particular change. And Andrew is a truly nice guy and is often described along with Bruce Bartlett as one of a small number of &#8220;honest conservative economists&#8221; by people like Brad DeLong, still it is interesting to me that the introduction to LMS starts off with these sentences:<br />
<blockquote>The three of us – former aides to President Clinton, Senator McCain, and President Bush – did an experiment to see if we could develop a reform plan that we could all support.  <br />The Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick (LMS) plan demonstrates the types of compromises that can help policy makers from across the political spectrum agree on a Social Security reform plan. The plan achieves sustainable solvency through progressive changes to taxes and benefits, introduces mandatory personal accounts, and specifies important details that are often left unaddressed in other reform plans.</p></blockquote>
<p> So while Prof. Samwick was maybe not the engineer here, he certainly was willing to board the train in time to draft LMS.</p>
<p>To which we return once again with an examination of Table 2 on page 7 along with this accompaning text:<br />
<blockquote>Sustainable solvency is achieved – The Social Security actuaries find that actuarial balance would improve by 2.14 percent of taxable payroll over the 75-year projection horizon. The current Social Security deficit is 1.92 percent of payroll.  Therefore, the changes in the plan would lead to a 0.22 surplus.  Trust fund balances in the last year of the actuaries’ projection period are positive and increasing.   (See http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/solvency/Liebman_20051117.pdf).</p></blockquote>
<p> Okay we have a 1.92% payroll gap and a 2.14% solution, reasonable enough. But what was this about a 5.2% solution? Where is the extra 3.06%? Well 1.56% percent of it is accounted for in the Table, that amount gets diverted to a new PRA, Private Retirement Account, leaving us missing only 1.5%. And where is that? Well buried in the text on page 1, LMS proposes a mandatory deduction of 1.5% credited directly to the individuals PRA and so not properly speaking contributing to Actuarial Balance and so excluded from Table 2.</p>
<p>Well I have to cry foul here. We have a problem scored 1.92% and a solution that includes a package of tax increases totaling 2.5% between the across the board increase and the payroll cap increase, that is more than enough to deliver 100% of scheduled benefits if simply applied to the Trust Fund. But we ALSO have an additional package of benefit cuts totaling 2.7% which itself would have closed all of the gap and then some. On the other hand the individual comes out of this with a PRA funded with a total of 3.06% of his wage income over that period. Perhaps the end result is a BETTER than 100% of scheduled benefit? Well no, a look at Table 1 shows that a retired couple can expect to get a result from 85% (low earner one worker) to 109% (high earner two worker) compared to the baseline schedule.</p>
<p>Well but what about Ownership Society? You have your PRA, surely you can pass those assets onto your heirs? Well no. Not unless you die quickly.<br />
<blockquote>All payments from PRAs would be paid as annuities, which would initially be required to be fixed, inflation-indexed annuities provided by the Social Security Administration as part of a beneficiary’s regular Social Security benefit.  Full annuitization by age 68 is required, but beneficiaries can choose to spread annuitization between 62 and 68 if so desired.  Married beneficiaries would be required to purchase joint and two-thirds survivor annuities.  Annuities would be 10-year certain annuities to provide payouts to heirs of those who die soon after annuitization.  The total balances in the accounts of the two spouses in a married couple would be split equally in the case of divorce.</p></blockquote>
<p> So what would workers see out of LMS? Well a joint survivor fixed income, inflation indexed annuity paid out monthly by the Social Security system. Which sounds identical to what happens today, except the result in the case of LMS is exposed to the market, the results in Table 1, bad as they are, assume &#8220;Expected Yield on Mixed Portfolio&#8221;. Meaning it is kind of a crap-shoot.</p>
<p>Does LMS do some good things? Well yes, but none of them particularly rebound to the benefit of most workers and certainly not lower earning workers. Instead they are asked to chip in a combination of 1.5% in &#8216;contributions&#8217; (they obviously would not be exposed to the cap increase) and take a guaranteed 2.7% cut in benefits hoping to make up around half of that through returns on their PRAs. How did the authors possibly proposed to sell that?</p>
<p>Time to put that Tin Foil Hat on. If you bury the 1.5% increase in the text and address all the other changes you have workers giving up 3.7%, or 2.7% for those earning under the old cap. Which is a lot to only partially solve a problem scored at 1.92% over 75 years. But not a lot to solve a problem scored at 3.5% over the Infinite Future. It is really the odd coincidence to have a new number pop up in the 2003 Report so useful for the purposes of selling a Privatization Plan that on one accounting requires just that amount of offset. How do you sell a plan that proposes a 5.2% solution to a problem scored 1.92%? Easy hide 1.5% of the solution and re-score the problem by 1.58%. Tin Foil Hat off.</p>
<p>As we confront the work of the new Deficit Commission it will be important for workers to firmly keep their own self-interest in mind and ask some serious questions. One what problem is the Commission actually addressing. Two how much of that problem if any was actually caused by Social Security. Three if the solution to that problem only calls for sacrifices by workers in the form of benefit cuts where is the equity. We know the way the problem will be framed, it will be expressed in dollar terms over the Infinite Future Horizon, it will be blamed on excessive Backward Transfers to previous generations, there will be attempts to blame Boomers for ruining the whole world with their greed. Because that is what the &#8216;reformers&#8217; have been doing for years, trying to find some way to stick workers with the tab.</p>
<p>Make them honestly define the problem they are solving. Make sure they use honest scores. Don&#8217;t let them frame this as some problem created by workers when it is nothing of the sort. And above all don&#8217;t let them bill you 5% for a problem that in 2009 was scored 2.01%. Social Security faces a real actuarial gap much as it has in various years past. And given that it is a plan financed for workers by workers it is incumbent on workers to suggest a solution. Dale, Arne and I have proposed a solution that delivers 100% of the scheduled benefit via a phased in set of payroll tax increases. Other workers might decide that it would be better to combine a lower set of increases with some changes in indexing or retirement age, or throw in some increase in cap levels. All of which is legitimate enough. What isn&#8217;t legitimate is for some Commission to use some bait and switch tactic like LMS does.</p>

<p>Maybe at this juncture, when Congress is beginning to talk about what to do about the sunsetting Bush tax provisions, it&#8217;s an appropriate time to remind ourselves about our historic commitment to progressivity in our tax system. A good source for thinking about this is an article by Tom Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, <a href="http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/piketty-saezJEP07taxprog.pdf" target="_blank">How Progressive is the U.S. Federal Tax System? A Historical and International Perspective</a>, 21 J. Econ. Perspectives 3 (2007).</p>
<p>What they show by looking at income and taxes over the period from 1960 to 2004 is revealing. While our system remains progressive to some extent, the progressivity has declined significantly. This is primarily, they say, because of the cuts in the corporate tax and the estate tax&#8211;taxes that impact the very wealthiest more than others because of their high ownership of financial assets. Our concept of distributive justice has always demanded that we should determine the tax burden based on individuals&#8217; relative abilities to pay&#8211;that means that those with lots more should pay proportionately more of their income, since those with very little need all of their income just to meet daily needs, and those with considerable wealth won&#8217;t even notice whether they have another few dollars or not.</p>
<p>The decades since Reagan took office have taken a huge toll on that sense of shared commitment. Fueled by a religious-like belief in the mathematically elegant but unrealistic assumptions of the &#8220;free market&#8221; economists from the Chicago School (see Yves Smith&#8217;s book, Econned, for a good take-down of the freshwater economists), the GOP in Congress passed huge tax cuts for the wealthy accompanied by increasingly heavy payroll taxes for others at the same time that spending continued apace&#8211;in fact, Reagan, Bush1 and Bush2 all greatly increased the military budgets and the Bushes embarked on wars of choice that imposed significant budgetary demands. The wealthy have fought for laws that favor them&#8211;deregulation, zero capital gains taxation, lower corporate taxes, the ability to offshore businesses and assets freely, privatization of social security and other programs (that would put more dollars under direct control of investment bankers and insurers), and lowering of individual tax rates and provisions that phased out deductions for the wealthy (like the phase out of the itemized deduction, which was repealed under Bush, etc.).</p>
<p>There are some really great graphs in the article&#8211;so look at it rather than just reading these excerpts. But if you only have time for excerpts, here are some key ideas.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Progressivity of the overall tax code has unambiguously declined in the United States and in the United Kingdom. The average share of income paid by those at the very top of the income distribution has dropped substantially. Id. at 21</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Large reductions in tax progressivity since the 1960s took place primarily during two periods: the Reagan presidency in the 1980s and the Bush administration in the early 2000s. The only significant increase in tax progressivity since 1960 took place in the early 1990s during the first Clinton administration. Id. at 23</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>many of the recent tax provisions that are currently hotly debated in Congress, such as whether there should be a permanent reduction in tax rates for capital gains and dividends, or whether the estate tax should be repealed, affect primarily the top percentile of the distribution—or even just an upper slice of the top percentile. This pattern strongly suggests that, in contrast to the standard political economy model, the progressivity of the current tax system is not being shaped by the self-interest of the median voter .12 Id. at 23.</p>
<p>12 Permanent reductions in dividend and capital gains combined with a repeal in the estate tax would certainly reduce the current progressivity of federal taxes and favor large wealth holders. The Alternative Mininum Tax, which is not indexed for inflation and hits more and more tax filers, will mostly increase tax burdens on the upper middle class but will not affect much the top 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The federal individual income tax is the largest tax, typically collecting 7–10 percent of GDP in most years since the 1960s. Individual income taxes declined sharply from 2000 to 2004 following the tax cuts of the Bush administration, falling from 10.3 percent of GDP in 2000 to 7.0 percent of GDP in 2004. The payroll tax financing Social Security and Medicare has increased significantly, climbing from about 2 percent of GDP in the 1960s to 6.4 percent of GDP by 2004. The corporate income tax has shrunk dramatically: it was typically 3.5– 4.0 percent of GDP in the 1960s, but had fallen to 1.6 percent of GDP by 2004. The estate and gift tax has always been very small relative to the other taxes, although it is important for distributional analysis because it disproportionately affects those with higher incomes. The estate tax collected about 0.6 percent of GDP in the 1960s, and 0.25 percent of GDP in 2004.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The greater progressivity of federal taxes in 1960, in contrast to 2004, stems from the corporate income tax and the estate tax. The corporate tax collected about 6.5 percent of total personal income in 1960 and only around 2.5 percent of total income today. [emphasis added] Because capital income is very concentrated, it generated a substantial burden on top income groups. The estate tax has also decreased from 0.8 percent of total personal income in 1960 to about 0.35 percent of total income today. As a result, the burden of the estate tax relative to income has declined very sharply since 1960 in the top income groups.</p></blockquote>

<p>Today I digress from my recent Eurozone obsessions to compare the U.S. Consumer Confidence report (released today) to the PMI production surveys, a &#8220;soft&#8221; comparison of supply and demand. <a href="http://www.conference-board.org/economics/ConsumerConfidence.cfm">According to the Conference Board today</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which had decreased in February, rebounded in March. The Index now stands at 52.5 (1985=100), up from 46.4 in February. The Present Situation Index increased to 26.0 from 21.7. The Expectations Index improved to 70.2 from 62.9 last month.<br />&#8230;<br />Consumers’ assessment of current-day conditions was less negative in March. Those claiming conditions are &#8220;bad&#8221; decreased to 42.8 percent from 45.1 percent, while those claiming business conditions are &#8220;good&#8221; increased to 8.6 percent from 6.8 percent. Consumers’ assessment of the labor market was also less pessimistic. Those saying jobs are &#8220;hard to get&#8221; declined to 45.8 percent from 47.3 percent, while those saying jobs are &#8220;plentiful&#8221; increased to 4.4 percent from 4.0 percent. </p></blockquote>
<p>This report is nothing to write home about. Consumer confidence remains at excruciatingly low levels.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7JpfD68UGI/AAAAAAAAC-M/e33J4zXgVdY/s1600/CONFIDENCE.PNG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7JpfD68UGI/AAAAAAAAC-M/e33J4zXgVdY/s400/CONFIDENCE.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>In a post back in September, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/08/consumer-confidence-fluff-or-thrill.html">I  argued</a> that the expectations index is a better indicator of  consumer spending. As such, the expectations component remains stronger  than the composite, having rebounded to its level at the onset of the  recession. However, like the composite index, the expectations index is  moving rather laterally since May 2009.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Notice the bigger picture, with the Confidence survey illustrated alongside the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys. The story remains to be very one-sided on the production side, which is more likely to drop back to meet weak consumer demand UNLESS THE JOBS MARKET IMPROVES&#8230;FOR REAL. <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2009/12/2010-census-economic-impact-probably.html">See my previous post</a> on the temporary effects of the Census hirings.</p>
<p>The underlying demand for goods and services, as determined by the 70% of the economy that is the Consumer, is weak, especially at this stage of the recovery (having already posted a positive quarter of economic growth). (By the way, if you want National Income data, the BEA offers an exceedingly easy way to download <a href="http://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2010/xls/gdp4q09_3rd.xls">it here</a>.)</p>
<p>These numbers challenge even the most optimistic of us all (that used to be yours truly).</p>

<p>I really enjoyed your recent post to OpenLeft about the war on Social Security. I wrote a related piece deconstructing Obama&#8217;s latest picks to the Debt Commission:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.alternet.org/story/146183/obama_packs_debt_commission_with_social_security_looters?page=entire">Alternet: Obama Packs Debt Commission with Social Security Looters?</a></p>
<p>Any feedback about the article or thoughts on the matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I run a watchdog website called <a target="_blank" href="http://littlesis.org/">LittleSis.org</a> that tracks ties between corporate and government elites, with an emphasis on Wall Street. We&#8217;re gearing up for a sustained investigation into the networks of funding and influence behind the latest attack on Social Security, and I wanted to just say hello and touch base. It seems that there could be more coordination happening between various folks keeping watch on this. </p>

<p> I have Matthew&#8217;s full contact info if serious people want it. But the piece is very good regardless.</p>
<p>(Update: Lifted from comments:<br />Movie Guy: &#8220;Matthew Skomarovsky wrote an excellent piece.  It strikes me that it deserved a stronger presentation at Angry Bear.  I doubt that many casual drive-by readers  bothered to click on the main post sublink.  But what a piece&#8221;)</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I was asked by <a href="http://www.diagonalperiodico.net/index2.php?intro=skip">Periódico Diagonal</a> to answer a few questions related to the Eurozone, based on several articles that I wrote (<a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/03/end-game-for-europe-wage-cutting-and.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/03/latvias-cost-cutting-does-stand-out.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/03/end-game-for-europe-wage-cutting-and.html">here</a>). I don&#8217;t know if these will be published, but &#8220;enquiring minds want to know&#8221;. Here we go:</p>
<p>1. In a recent article you announced that the next cycle of crisis in Europe will be determined by the struggle for exports. Does that mean that the country which lags behind in this struggle for exports will suffer from falling wages?</p>
<p>Rebecca: What I meant was that the Eurozone might find itself in a “race to the bottom”. The prescript coming out of the IMF and the European Union is one of harsh and deep reductions in nominal income (wages) and prices in order to reduce relative prices enough to drive export income. Normally, downward pressure on internal prices via recession occurs alongside a sharp devaluation in the currency, where external demand pulls the economy back onto its feet. But the main problem across the Eurozone IS ITS CONSTRUCT, one currency “to rule them all”. Greece, nor any of the other GIIPS countries – Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain – can devalue the currency in order to drive export growth.</p>
<p>The problem is that without proper export growth, the internal devaluation would more accurately take the form of “infernal devaluation”. Cuts to nominal income, wealth (via pensions), and other labor variables will restrict current consumption and aggregate spending to a point where such measures then pressure government deficits. It’s a vicious circle, not to mention a fallacy of composition to think that the aggregate can export its way out recession if wages are falling – spending, by definition, must be falling, too.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>2. In this sense, the IMF´s advice is to decrease wages and promote privatization of common services. Are we facing the first IMF´s serious intervention in (¿most developed?) the North countries? In that case, what is the aim of these adjustment policies? Do you think they will benefit countries like Greece or Iceland? Or is it just a matter of financial balance and euro´s credibility?</p>
<p>Rebecca: The Iceland economy received IMF support in November 2008, but IMF lending comes at the cost of conditional fiscal austerity programs and macroeconomic measures, including trimming the government-funded pension system, reduced wages, and other related budget cuts. Iceland has muddled through, though, because it has something that Greece (nor any other Eurozone country) doesn’t have: a free-floating, non-convertible currency.</p>
<p>The Iceland case is very different from Greece (or any of the GIIPS), though, because it issued a lot of debt that is denominated in foreign currency. But nevertheless, the Iceland krona depreciated around 50% against the US dollar between July 2008 and December 2009, driving exports and reducing imports. In 2009, real GDP in Iceland fell 6.5%, the biggest drag came from government spending that shaved 12.2% off of GDP growth. However, the contribution coming from exports and imports was +14.2%, which more than offset the drag from the IMF’s “austerity measures”.</p>
<p>Greece doesn’t have this option, since it cannot devalue its currency. Greece can only reduce wages and prices enough to generate internal devaluation resulting in the prescribed export growth. That’s just not going to fly when the Eurozone as a whole is fighting for export income.</p>
<p>But worse yet, there’s a positive feedback loop here that will likely result in a debt deflation scenario, normally resulting in private-sector default. Let’s use Iceland, again, as an example. In 2009, private consumption dragged GDP growth a large 7.8%. In Greece’s case, the effect on consumption would be magnified, since without the benefit of external income generation the private sector must take a larger hit. As consumption falls, so too do tax receipts and the primary deficit rises once more – the positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>3. You say it is impossible for all European countries to decrease wages in order to increase exports because –we suppose- this would reduce, in some way, domestic demand and, therefore, trade within the European Union, seeming to be no other way out. How can we get out of this situation? Could it be the end of the monetary union -so that some countries prefer currency devaluation in order to gain competitiveness?</p>
<p>Rebecca: It probably won’t be the end of the EMU, but I wouldn’t be surprised if some countries defaulted, which then increases the likelihood of the “end of the EMU”. What we have is an unsustainable situation in the Eurozone, as key countries face “infernal devaluation”. Without an epic surge in export growth, the government austerity programs called upon by the E.U. (or the IMF) will force the private sector to accumulate debt in order to balance out the aggregate forces of income and spending. That’s just fact.</p>
<p>The Eurozone was built upon the premise that there would be a unified currency and an un-unified fiscal system. In order to balance the inherent fiscal challenges that come along with inherently different saving motives across the 16 EMU countries, strict rules were set in place: no government is “allowed” to run fiscal deficits in excess of 3% nor accumulate debt in excess of 60% of GDP. Countries are fined, but that didn’t stop them from hiding government obligations from the European Union via sophisticated <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,676634,00.html">derivative securities</a>. In the end, you have a band-aid plan to satisfy markets so that Greece can attempt to rollover its near-term debt. This “bailout” comes with no specifics as to threshold levels that must be crossed in order to get the central E.U. players to offer support, which is no doubt by design. Nothing has changed here; no lessons learned; the Eurozone is still just as flawed as it was ten years ago.</p>
<p>What has now become obvious to those who did not see this coming, is that the Eurozone, in its construct, was never meant to withstand the financial contagion and ensuing global recession of 2007-2009.</p>
<p>4. The European media are suggesting this week that the European Union should “let Greece fall” as a sign of credibility. What do you think of this issue?</p>
<p>Rebecca: Unless the structure of the EMU was changed for the better, meaning fiscal consolidation, the Eurozone would be no more “credible” after the default of Greece.</p>
<p>5. What is your opinion concerning the possibility of creating a European Monetary Fund, which has recently come up in the news?</p>
<p>Rebecca: It is an awful idea and ridden with disruptive side effects. In essence, the EMF would be established to prevent sovereign default from causing contagion throughout the Eurozone. If funds are dispersed immediately, the obvious result is the lop-sided power engendered to those countries that contribute, rather than borrow, from the fund. From the get-go, the EMF would generate political pressures from the creditor countries to the unduly strained debtor countries.</p>
<p>With such power comes abuse, as illustrated by the International Monetary Fund’s involvement during the Asian Financial Crisis. The IMF proved itself to be highly intrusive into local sovereignty and adopted a one-size-fits-all policy to its conditional lending programs. There is a reason that capital controls are the policy du jour in Asia, and consequently not part of the IMF’s “prescription”.</p>
<p>It is NOT unlikely that the same [abuse] would happen under the EMF.</p>
