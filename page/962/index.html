<blockquote>And President Clinton, who snuck through a big tax-rate increase in 1992, experienced the retribution of voters in the 1994 midterm elections when Democrats lost control of both the House and Senate.</p></blockquote>
<p>This would have been a neat trick as George H. W. Bush was President in 1992.  President Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 on August 10, 1993 (must distinguish this from 2003).  This bill and some alternatives proposals were openly debated in both the House and the Senate.  To suggest it was “snuck through” is dishonest.  But what would you expect from someone who doesn’t even realize that Bill Clinton did not become President until January 20, 1993?</p>

<blockquote>By having the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court conduct the review instead of a regular federal court, the Bush administration would ensure the secrecy of details of the highly classified program. The administration has argued that making details of the program public would compromise national security. However, such details could include politically explosive disclosures that the government has kept tabs on people it shouldn&#8217;t have been monitoring.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/009042.php">Josh Marshall</a> was alerted to this passage by a TPM reader and notes:<br />
<blockquote>It sounds like Landay&#8217;s pointing to the possibility that the White House has been using the program to monitor political opponents. (I&#8217;m not sure how else to interpret that line.) And you get the sense he&#8217;s doing more than speculating.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m guilty of the same speculation but why would the White House be so afraid of a FISA Court review?  Of course, some rightwingers would view spying on Democrats as being equivalent to spying on terrorists.</p>

                                <p>Had John Kerry become President and invited Alice Rivlin to be part of his economic team, I suspect her advice to President Kerry would be similar to the advice she offered President Clinton.  <a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=harrop13&#038;date=20060713">Froma Harrop </a> reminds us of how Hubert Humphrey defined being a liberal back in 1949:<br />
<blockquote>Back in 1949, the great Minnesota liberal Hubert Humphrey was pointedly asked on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; whether progressives like himself cared about holding down the costs of government. Humphrey answered yes, but &#8220;economy in government to me doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean spending little. It means spending what you have and spending it well &#8230; &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>Harrop’s discussion then turns to the current Administration that pretends to be giving us tax cuts as it piles massive amounts of deferred tax liabilities upon us:<br />
<blockquote>As for White House comparisons, there&#8217;s no contest. The current Republican administration leaves its Democratic predecessor in the dust for both amounts spent and money wasted. Bush is the biggest spender since Lyndon Johnson, according to the Cato Institute. In domestic discretionary spending (which doesn&#8217;t include defense or entitlements), Bush has Johnson beat. By contrast, Bill Clinton stands as a paragon of restraint. Domestic discretionary spending jumped an average 8 percent a year in Bush&#8217;s first term, versus only 2.5 percent annually in Clinton&#8217;s eight years. Many conservatives are amazed that Democrats haven&#8217;t made more hay of their superior record in containing the size of government. The Democrats&#8217; dilemma is that they are not philosophically opposed to expanded government, even if in practice they have shown far more spending discipline. Democrats really ought to brag about their Clintonian track record. Not only did they keep government growth in check, but they paid its bills the old-fashioned way, with tax revenues. That&#8217;s what fiscal rectitude is all about. And it shines next to the Bush administration&#8217;s disgraceful habit of borrowing on the backs of future generations. Even more important, Democrats have spent the taxpayers&#8217; money with greater care. The reason, in part, is that Democrats don&#8217;t maintain a childlike faith in the good intentions and can-do of the private sector. They believe in regulating these guys — and that government can do some things better than can business. The Bush administration likes to send big checks and a have-a-nice-day to private contractors, who then do as they please. Our MBA president seems to forget that he is supposed to represent the taxpayers in these transactions, not the business interests. </p></blockquote>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Even though <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/posts/2006/07/13/novak-attacks-murray-waas-on-hannity-colmes">Dr. Novak</a> has been a busy person countering all those who would dare spread vicious lies about his role in PlameGate, he has taken the time to explain the <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/evansnovak.php?id=16011#2">economic principles</a> behind Bush’s fiscal fiasco for us:</p>
<blockquote><p>The White House Office of Management and Budget had originally forecast a deficit of $423 billion for fiscal 2006 &#8211; instead, increased tax revenues have pushed the estimate down to about $296 billion. </p>
<p>1. Accusations that the administration is employing the famous UPOD business principle &#8211; &#8220;under-promise, over-deliver&#8221; &#8211; are not entirely unjustified, considering that the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office had originally forecast a deficit of just $350 billion. Still, both were wrong by a very large margin (15.4 percent for the CBO and 30 percent for the White House), and the positive reversal of fortune clearly had nothing to do with fiscal discipline in the Congress. </p>
<p>2. The real culprit here for the errors is the practice of static scoring of tax revenues, which is still employed by the government despite experience. Both the White House and the CBO score the loss of tax revenue from tax-cuts as though they did not affect the behavior of business owners, shareholders and other investors &#8211; a sure recipe for missing the mark. </p>
<p>3. Setting aside the obvious fact that most of the Bush deficits are 9/11-related, the principles of supply-side economics are vindicated both by the success of the 2003 tax cuts in maintaining and even raising tax revenues, and the failure of the 2001 across-the board income tax cuts to do the same. Large cuts in the top marginal tax rates have the greatest effect on economic growth, and the growth is augmented when cuts are closest to the investment side of the economy.</p>
<p>4. The lesson is that tax cuts that focus on investment &#8211; such as the 2003 dividend and capital-gains tax cuts &#8211; really do affect investor behavior. More money pours into capital markets when investors realize a greater after-tax return. Corporations are, therefore, freer to expand business and profits. Moreover, investors are less hesitant to realize smaller gains when those gains are taxed at a lower rate &#8211; the top rate now being 15 percent. This results in a greater number of transactions, meaning more tax revenue that would not have been collected under a high-tax regime. This explains why the tax-rate cuts&#8217; overall effect on tax revenues, depending on who is doing the measuring, has been negligible or even positive.</p>
<p>5. CBO&#8217;s estimate for the fiscal 2007 deficit is $337 billion. In January 2004, President Bush made the rather weak promise of halving the budget deficit by 2009. It is not exactly clear when that promise can be considered fulfilled &#8211; the fiscal 2004 budget deficit ended up being $413 billion, but the projection had been $477 billion. Either way, he is already within striking distance. The problem in the long- and even medium-run is that as entitlements become more expensive with an aging population, a balanced budget becomes less possible. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now – I feel MUCH better!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As <a href="http://levin.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ODk1ODc1MTY2NTdmNjljMDExNTliYWYwNjBkMTg0Mjg">Mark Levin</a> opines on the civil suit filed by Joe Wilson and his wife, he seems to not know something here:<br />
<blockquote>To the extent possible, through depositions and document production, Cheney and Lewis&#8217;s lawyers should get to the bottom of the real scandal, e.g., who exactly is Valerie Plame, what was her role in sending her husband to Niger, who were all of her contacts, what media sources did she speak to, what politicians did she speak to, and on and on.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s help Mark out.  Plame did not talk to media sources or politicians and her sources are (or should I say were) national security secrets.  But if Mr. Levin does not know what she is by now, maybe Dr. Novak can explain that one to him since he let the rest of the world know back on July 14, 2003.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>One of the Big Four accounting firms is telling its clients:<br />
<blockquote>The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) is providing $137 billion in tax cuts over 10 years and comprises three major elements: tax relief for U.S.-based manufacturing activities, reforms in the taxation of multinational businesses and four dozen targeted items of business income tax relief. The act also contains targeted individual tax cuts and excise tax reforms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of this $137 billion comes from changes in section 965 addressing how repatriated profits will be taxed.  U.S. multinational corporations have a one-time opportunity to repatriate low-taxed foreign earnings at an incremental U.S. tax cost as low as 5.25%.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2139782">Michelle Leder</a> provided this estimate of the significance of this provision:<br />
<blockquote>IBM, for example, is banking a $2.8 billion refund = well, better to call it a &#8220;tax savings&#8221; &#8211; because instead of paying the normal corporate tax rate of 35 percent on $9.5 billion in profits it earned overseas, the company paid only 5.25 percent … Analysts anticipate that American companies will have repatriated around $350 billion in 2005 as a result of the law. While it&#8217;s hard to make a straight calculation because of the vagaries of the tax code, that works out to a savings of roughly $104 billion on corporate America&#8217;s tax bill. At Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant that announced the single largest repatriation &#8211; $37 billion &#8211; the one-time windfall works out to approximately $11 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>5.25% times $350 billion would translate into almost $18.4 billion in one-time tax revenues but at what cost?  Ms. Leder’s $104 billion is assuming that the U.S. Treasury would have received in the same year 35% times $350 billion or $122.5 billion.  </p>
<p>Well maybe we should admit a coupe of qualifying factors.  One comes from the foreign tax credit where the Treasury collects the difference between 35% and the tax rate charged abroad.  Since we are talking about deferral strategies which are typically used by putting these profits into low-tax jurisdictions, let’s assume a 10% foreign tax rate so the differential is only 25%.  In other words, the calculation should be 25% times $350 billion or $87.5 billion.  Secondly, deferral implies time value of money.  Let’s assume the profits would not have been repatriated for another 5 years and let’s use a 5% discount rate, which means we gave up $68.5 billion in present value terms to get $18.4 billion now.</p>
<p>So as the Bush Administration crows about the “surge” in taxes, let’s just remember that this is yet another example of Enron accounting where in reality the government gave away $50 billion on net.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/07/silliness-on-budget-deficit.html">Dean Baker</a> criticizes two threads of how the press reports the deficit by taking a medium term perspective.  The first is levied against those free lunch supply-side types:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we go back to 2001, before the economy had the benefit of President Bush’s tax cuts, CBO projected the economy to grow by 20 percent between 2000 and 2006. On its current path, growth over this period is projected to be 16.7 percent. (CBO’s growth projections are constructed to average in the effect of recessions, so the 2001 recession should not affect this story. Furthermore, even the White House’s growth projections do not show the economy ever catching up to the path projected by CBO in 2001. In other words, the White House’s economists don’t believe that the tax cuts have had any substantial impact on growth.) Getting to tax revenue, CBO’s projection of revenue for 2006 was more than 20 percent higher (adjusted for inflation) than the White House’s latest figure. In other words, the economy is behind its pre-tax cut growth path and its way behind its pre-tax cut revenue path. Users of arithmetic know that the tax cuts did not come anywhere close to paying for themselves. The fact that tax revenues are coming in somewhat higher than expected this year is explained largely by the strong stock market performance last year and the resulting increase in capital gains tax revenue. There is always a large random component to tax collections. Arguing about the budget situation based on these random fluctuations is like drawing conclusions on global warming based on yesterday’s weather.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean also notes that the rise in debt relative to GDP over the past five years has not yet bankrupted the Federal government.  If critics of Bush’s fiscal fiasco (which includes yours truly) are writing such statements, we need to be more clear.  The point is that we cannot sustain the current course of fiscal policy just as we could not sustain the Reagan fiscal fiasco forever.  We did see a reversal of the upward path of the debt to GDP ratio once we decided to reverse those tax cuts and had the luxury of the peace dividend.  So are we on a bankruptcy path?  No – unless President Bush gets his way and makes these tax cuts sine spending cuts a permanent policy.  But our point has been – or should be – we never had a tax cut but rather a tax shift.  In other words, President Bush has passed some rather massive increases in deferred taxes.  Who will pay those deferred taxes?  Don’t look to the leadership in the Republican Party to tell us the truth to this question.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTg0MTM1NGY1NzMxNzI0ZGMwNTU2OWViYjgxMTFkZDk=">Phil Kerpen</a> takes the long-term view:</p>
<blockquote><p>The deficit is actually quite modest in historical terms &#8230; Since current budget deficits are affordable, any fiscal focus on them is misdirected. That said, the country’s true fiscal outlook is not so good. A pair of reports released in May by the Medicare and Social Security Trustees and the Government Accountability Office, respectively, should serve as a wake-up call for the public and our elected representatives … The off-the-books, unfunded obligations of the federal government are an order of magnitude greater. The GAO found that the government’s true debt &#8211; on-the-books and off &#8211; more than doubled between 2000 and 2005, and now stands at a staggering $46.4 trillion. GAO, it seems, actually low-balled the true debt by using the entitlement obligations for only the next 75 years. To permanently fix these programs we’d have to put up enough money to cover all of their obligations forever. That’s where the Trustees Report comes in. Using the estimates from that report, the federal government’s true debt is shown to be a stunning $94.7 trillion … The Social Security program alone has a $13.4 trillion liability, more than all of the government’s on-the-books debt combined.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I understand why both Bruce Bartlett and Max Sawicky hate these long-run present value calculations.  Kerpen is spinning that it’s those Social Security benefits that are the real problem even that 13.4 divided by 94.7 is less than 15% of the very long-term issue.  What constitutes the other 85%?  Maybe it’s those tax cuts financed by increases in defense spending?  Or maybe it’s that expensive prescription drug benefit financed by more tax cuts.  </p>
<p>It would have been nice had Kerpen told us the present value of expected future GDP so we could take this $13.4 trillion relative to the present value of expected future GDP.  Then we would realize that the reduction in Social Security benefits and/or the increase in the payroll tax is actually quite modest.  But had Kerpen written something a little more honest – I doubt Rich Lowry would have allowed him to publish it.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Beyond the hypocrisy coming from the king of pork, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzFjOTE5N2E2NjE5MzUxN2IxNGFjYjE4ODUzN2VlZGQ=">Grover Norquist</a>, I’m struggling with the advanced mathematics that must be implicit in this statement:<br />
<blockquote>If spending increased only as a percentage of national income since 2001, the federal government would have a $20 billion budget surplus (not a $296 billion deficit) in fiscal year 2006. Moreover, the country would never have reached surplus in the late 1990s if spending equaled national income. The surplus resulted because spending was actually lower than national income during that time period.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, I know he should have referred to the growth in Federal spending matching the growth in GDP.  Federal spending as a share of GDP was 19.0% during calendar year 2000 as compared to 20.4% during calendar year 2005.  Since GDP was just under $12.5 trillion, my calculator – which must not be Sesame Street approved – tells me that the increase in the ratio of Federal spending to GDP accounts for only $180 billion of the increase in the deficit as being portrayed in terms of the unified deficit.</p>
<p>I know CalculatedRisk wants to jump in here and say something about the General Fund deficit, but could someone who dares get inside the brain of Grover Norquist explain to me how $180 billion become $316 billion?  </p>
<p>I wonder if <a href="http://www.zeroboutique.com/grover">this character</a> might help us out here?!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader cactus keeps telling me to use OMB figures based on fiscal years rather than BEA figures based on calendar years.  As I go to the link provided by cactus, I think I discover how Norquist is getting his spin.  Consider the following outlay to GDP figures by fiscal year:</p>
<p>18.4% for 2000<br />18.5% for 2001<br />20.1% for 2005<br />20.8% for 2006-PROJECTED<br />20.1% for 2007-projected</p>
<p>So Norquist’s math is not based on actual spending but one of those infamous OMB forecasts.  But maybe this forecast will be on the mark given how badly things are going in Iraq etc.  Of course, Norquist is pretending that spending will continue to be this high even as the OMB projection is for outlays to drop back to 20.1% of GDP for fiscal year.  We should also mention that the “surge” in tax revenues had transitional elements that will not likely re-occur next year either.</p>

                                <p>After reading the reveal nothing column from <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=15988">Robert Novak</a>, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjdlOWZhYTFlZmE0Njk1ZDExYjQ0NzMwMjVkYjgzMGE=">Jonah Goldberg</a> makes an amazing discovery:</p>
<blockquote><p>Okay so the government official who leaked Plame&#8217;s CIA status to Novak is known to Fitzgerald. He hasn&#8217;t been charged. If Novak&#8217;s version is to be believed, and I don&#8217;t see why it shouldn&#8217;t be, the initial leak wasn&#8217;t some nefarious assault on Wilson, but an &#8220;inadvertant&#8221; mistake. So what, exactly, was the big deal? The CIA itself confirmed Plame&#8217;s employment status. Where are the apologies? The whole thing was a big stupid nothing. I&#8217;m not saying by the way, the matter shouldn&#8217;t have been investigated. Merely that the investigation revealed that the initial suspicions were unfounded.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s review the facts as we know them – Bill Harlow (the member of the CIA) upon learning that Novak is about to out the fact that Valerie Plame is a CIA agent tells Novak that it would be a mistake if he does run his piece.  Novak’s primary source was someone within the Administration other than Karl Rove (somewhere we should say something about the Office of the Vice President).  Patrick Fitzgerald’s grand jury is still in session.  So how does Jonah Goldberg know that no wrongdoing occurred?  He does have powers beyond my comprehension!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Even rightwinger <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Conservative_Scarborough_Accidental_leak_story_garbage_0712.html">Joe Scarborough</a> finds the Novak canard that the leak was an accident to be of questionable merit:<br />
<blockquote>Conservative commentators are already trumpeting Novak&#8217;s claim that the leak was inadvertent and accidental &#8230; Maybe I&#8217;m cynical or perhaps it&#8217;s because I worked in Congress for years. But you know what, I always found that leaks of this size were rarely mistakes regardless of what the writer or the right-wing people may tell you. I can assure you that if you assign selfish motives to leakers, you will rarely be proven wrong.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/07/12/yawnwheres-the-news-bob">Christy</a> has more including a picture of a hippo yawning at the Novak “news”.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzU0NmFmODhkYzRiZGY0YWQzYjQwMjkyZjI5ZDAyNDU=">Kate O&#8217;Beirne</a> for the defense:<br />
<blockquote>But Scooter Libby&#8217;s memory is the only one that merits criminal charges and it appears that investigators have known that the disclosure of Plame&#8217;s employment was &#8220;inadvertent&#8221; since the Fall of 2003. This investigation and the indictment are ridiculous.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shorter Kate: obstruction of justice and perjury are AOK if my client has a different memory of events from the prosecutor’s witnesses – especially if I can get a fellow hack to write some garbage over at Human Events.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/009011.php">Josh Marshall</a> comes the latest from <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=politicsNews&#038;storyid=2006-07-12T003233Z_01_N11276431_RTRUKOC_0_US-SECURITY-HOEKSTRA.xml&#038;src=rss&#038;rpc=22">Peter Hoekstra</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Michigan Republican Rep. Peter Hoekstra also suggested some unauthorized leaks could have been deliberate attempts to help al Qaeda.  &#8220;More frequently than what we would like, we find out that the intelligence community has been penetrated, not necessarily by al Qaeda, but by other nations or organizations,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any evidence. But from my perspective, when you have information that is leaked that is clearly helpful to our enemy, you cannot discount that possibility,&#8221; he added.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unbelivable ! Hoekstra did not mention the outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame and her colleagues but I will.  Given that these agents were looking into the possibility that Iran might be developing nuclear weapons, how could anyone but so stupid to suggest that this leak did not harm national security – unless they are frequent readers of <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/">this</a> or <a href="http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2006/07/back_to_i_lewis.html">this</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/11/novak-explanation">ThinkProgress</a> has the latest on Mr. Novak.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=15988">Robert Novak</a> reveals little:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was interrogated at the Swidler Berlin offices Oct. 7, 2003, by an FBI inspector and two agents. I had not identified my sources to my attorneys, and I told them I would not reveal them to the FBI. I did disclose how Valerie Wilson&#8217;s role was reported to me, but the FBI did not press me to disclose my sources.</p></blockquote>
<p>So before Fitzgerald took over this investigation – the FBI was not asking who Novak’s primary source was?</p>
<blockquote><p>However, on Jan. 12, two days before my meeting with Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor informed Hamilton that he would be bringing to the Swidler Berlin offices only two waivers. One was by my principal source in the Valerie Wilson column, a source whose name has not yet been revealed. The other was by presidential adviser Karl Rove, whom I interpret as confirming my primary source&#8217;s information. In other words, the special prosecutor knew the names of my sources.</p></blockquote>
<p>And even today, Novak does not disclose the name of his primary source.  The rest of his Human Events piece is just Novak posturing and spinning with lines like these:<br />
<blockquote>That Fitzgerald did not indict any of these sources may indicate his conclusion that none of them violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act &#8230; Following my interview with the primary source, I sought out the second administration official and the CIA spokesman for confirmation. I learned Valerie Plame&#8217;s name from Joe Wilson&#8217;s entry in &#8220;Who&#8217;s Who in America.&#8221; I considered his wife&#8217;s role in initiating Wilson&#8217;s mission, later confirmed by the Senate Intelligence Committee, to be a previously undisclosed part of an important news story. I reported it on that basis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Novak remains the loyal puppet for this Administration.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://finance.senate.gov/press/Bpress/2005press/prb071106a.pdf">Max Baucus</a> has been reading the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/budget/fy2006/pdf/06msr.pdf">Mid-Session Review</a> and is not happy with one proposal:<br />
<blockquote>The Mid-Session Budget Review released by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) today included a proposal that would spend $721 billion – nearly $10 billion more than originally planned in the President’s original Fiscal Year 2007 budget – to turn Social Security into a system of private accounts with lower guaranteed benefits to Americans. The President’s proposal to privatize Social Security includes significant cuts in guaranteed benefits for the vast majority of Social Security recipients through the indexing of initial benefits to prices, rather than wages.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, I’ve only included Senator Baucus’s recitation of the facts.  Read on as he blasts this proposal.  But to be fair and balanced, let’s review the claims made by the OMB:</p>
<blockquote><p>This update also includes the estimated budget impact from the creation of personal accounts under the President’s Social Security reform proposal. Transition financing for these accounts would not begin to take effect until 2009, and is easily accommodated within the President’s deficit reduction goal &#8230; The greatest fiscal danger over the long-term is posed by the unfunded obligations in major entitlement programs &#8211; Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The rising costs of these programs are tied largely to two factors: The aging of the population, and the growing use and cost of health care. Both of these factors are largely structural. In 2008, the first of the Baby Boom generation begins to collect Social Security benefits. In 2017, the program will collect less in payroll taxes than it pays out in benefits. At that point, the system will be funded partially by general tax revenue. In 2041, the system is projected to go bankrupt because it will have insufficient resources to pay benefits. </p></blockquote>
<p>We have to stop as we’ve allowed too many lies to go unanswered.  First, the Social Security Trust Fund will be accumulating a lot of reserves that will be paying interest so that reserves will continue to grow after 2017.  At some point, this pre-funding will be drawn upon to pay for the defined benefits owed to the baby boomers but this system is not bankrupt as of 2041.  It is true that the prescription drug benefit was passed just as we were cutting taxes – so when President Bush brags to us about giving us this allegedly free entitlement and giving us our money back – he is lying through his teeth, but that should not be confused with the solvency of Social Security.  But let’s have these dishonest hacks return to the microphone: <br />
<blockquote>President Bush has proposed reforms to address the system’s long-term insolvency while making Social Security a better deal for today’s young workers. </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – everyone can be better off as there are free lunches as far as the eye can see!  <strong>Pathetic!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Via <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/009018.php">Josh Marshall</a> comes <a href="http://www.crgazette.com/2006/07/12/Home/grassley.htm">Senator Grassley</a> sayings it is not fair for us Democrats to discuss the President’s proposal to trash Social Security:<br />
<blockquote>Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Wednesday Democrats such as Bruce Braley in the 1st District House race are abusing the issue of Social Security reform for political gain.  Grassley said the Democrats are losing Iraq as a political issue to recapture a congressional majority and have fallen back to &#8220;scare tactics&#8221; about Social Security to fuel their campaign.  &#8220;I don’t think I agree right now there is a big push by anybody to set up personal accounts&#8221; under Social Security, Grassley told Iowa reporters.  Braley, in the Democrats’ response to last Saturday’s national radio address by President Bush,  said Social Security was &#8220;under attack&#8221; because of attempts by Bush to privatize it.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are not allowed to talk about minimum wages either – just flag burning, I guess.</p>
