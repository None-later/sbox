                                <p>Over at <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2007/10/president-clintons-social-security.html">EconoSpeak</a>, I criticized the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/30/AR2007093001209.html">WaPo</a> coverage of something Hillary Clinton said about Social Security:</p>
<blockquote><p>she noted, the insolvency date has moved from 2055 to 2041.</p></blockquote>
<p>I do not trust anything the Washington Post says either about Social Security or about what the Senator has to try.  I do trust <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=10&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=the_clintons_and_social_securi">Dean Baker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the last debate for the Democratic presidential candidates Senator Clinton was asked about Social Security. In her response she made the obviously true statement that the key to dealing with the problem is to maintain a strong economy. (The issue is supporting retirees, if we have a strong economy we can do this, if the economy is in bad shape, then this is a problem regardless of what we do with Social Security).   She also made the somewhat confused assertion that the projected date for the SS Trust Fund&#8217;s depletion had been pushed back to 2055 under the Clinton I administration. (I think that she may have been referring to the first set of projections for SS put out by CBO, which put the date of depletion at 2052.) While the economy did experience healthy growth in the last four years of the Clinton administration, and the projected date of trust fund depletion actually was pushed back several years by the SS trustees, this was actually due to a cut in benefits, not more rapid economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>So where did the Washington Post get the 2041?  <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/4-24-07socsec.pdf">Robert Greenstein</a> has an explanation. As I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The year when the Trust Fund is expected to be exhausted is indeed 2041 but that compares to a prediction from the 1997 report that the predicted year of exhaustion was 2029. Also notice that the “year costs exceed tax revenue and interest” is predicted to be 2027 – well after the next President Clinton leaves office.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.galluppoll.com/content/default.aspx?ci=28930">Gallup</a> has a poll out:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans in America today remain deeply distrustful of the national news media &#8212; in sharp contrast to Democrats, who have a great deal more trust in the media&#8217;s accuracy. Overall, less than half of Americans, regardless of partisanship, have a great deal or a fair amount of trust in the mass media. Nearly half of Americans &#8212; including over three-quarters of Republicans &#8212; perceive the media as too liberal while fewer than one in five say the media are too conservative. Americans are less likely to perceive bias in their local news media than in the national news media.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t trust the media that much either.  I wouldn&#8217;t be blogging if I did.  Basic economic facts are usually gotten wrong &#8211; reporters often simply report whatever nonsense the White House tells them, and rarely bother to check the facts, though the facts are often easily found.   So my general rule of thumb is to trust the sources that tend to get things that I am able to check myself right&#8230; my assumption is that if they&#8217;re wrong on things I can check myself, odds are they&#8217;re probably wrong on a whole lot of other stuff too.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;m interested in the first line, about how Republicans have less faith in the media than Democrats.  One of my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/does-australia-exist.html">favorite posts</a> dealt with this issues (go ahead and read it, this post isn&#8217;t leaving!), but let me try again, in fewer words this time.</p>
<p>I suspect many of these folks would claim to trust the media more if it had been reporting for the past six and a half years that the economy is doing really well, Afghanistan is a flowering democracy, WMDs were found in Iraq, the War in Iraq is going swimmingly, and people all across the Middle East are embracing American-style democracy and American-style Christianity.  No doubt throwing in the odd story about how Europe is sinking into the sea would be even more helpful.   But I also suspect that, at heart, these people know these things aren&#8217;t true, as much as they want to hear these stories reported in the news.  And I also wonder&#8230; would anyone trust the media if it was telling us stories like these?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>It has been a while since I even bothered to read this serial nonsense from <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MWQwMzhlODQ3MjJmZTdmOWE3NGNjZThiYzlkMDBmODY=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> but as I was reading <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_10/012228.php">Kevin Drum</a> he subjected me to seeing this:</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, we don&#8217;t need six income-tax brackets. Here&#8217;s a thought: Take the 33 percent bracket that starts at $188,450 and get rid of it. Ditto for the 28 percent bracket at $123,700 and the 25 percent bracket at $61,300. Get rid of them. Collapse it all down into one simple 15 percent tax bracket. Then figure out what kind of spending cuts are necessary to finance it.</p></blockquote>
<p>If everyone paid 15 percent of all of their income – no exemptions, no progressivity – this would not cover the non-Social Security portion of Federal outlays including interest over the long-run (something to do with those rising health care expenditures due to the Prescription Drug Benefit).  Is Kudlow so stupid that he doesn’t realize that this would be a massive Federal income tax increase on the middle class, the working poor, and even those in poverty?  Kevin is not so incredibly stupid:</p>
<blockquote><p>My back-of-the-envelope calculation says Larry&#8217;s fiscal brainstorm will cost us about $250 billion. So now that I&#8217;ve figured that out for him, how about if he games out the spending cuts first and then we take a look at his revenue ideas? It&#8217;s funny that no one ever wants to do that, but $250 billion in cuts to the non-defense, non-security, non-Medicare, non-Social Security, non-interest categories of the federal budget ought to be pretty easy for a bunch of fiscal barracudas like the modern GOP, shouldn&#8217;t it? And I think the Republican presidential field would be pretty pleased to run on all these spending cuts once somebody puts them on the table. So let&#8217;s hear it.  On the bright side, at least Larry is conceding that these tax cuts would require spending reductions in the first place. In his usual alternative universe he would have just said they&#8217;d pay for themselves and no reductions would be necessary, so I guess that&#8217;s progress. Then again, maybe he just momentarily forgot his talking points today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Something tells me that Fred Thompson and RUDY are both calling Kudlow the Klown to help them fine tune their fiscal messages.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: On the spending side, Kudlow the Klown writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you look at the non-defense, non-security budget between FY 2001 and FY 2007 — when the GOP controlled three houses in Washington — spending rose roughly $550 billion dollars. That’s a whopping 38 percent, or 5.5 percent each year. It’s also more than twice the 2.4 percent inflation rate during that period.  The Education Department was by far the biggest transgressor. It posted an alarming yearly growth of 11.4 percent. Other obvious abusers include the Interior Department, which grew at 5.8 percent, and Transportation, which came in at 4.4 percent. Rounding out the profligate herd was Energy with 5.1 percent; Agriculture at 4.5 percent; and HUD at 4 percent. Every single one of these government agencies ballooned its budget well beyond the inflation rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max Sawicky might call these big increases in small programs.  But Kudlow also notes that total nondefense spending has risen by 5.5% per year!  That’s in nominal terms folks and it is about the same of the growth rate of nominal GDP.  Check out <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/question-to-dana-perino-who-should-pay.html">my graph</a> of nondefense Federal purchases.  Kudlow wants you to believe these are huge and growing rapidly.  Even a village idiot would know this claim was false.  I suspect Kudlow is not THAT stupid.  But would this hack lie to his readers?  Why not?  He usual does.</p>
<p>Someone needs to ask Rich Lowry and Jonah Goldberg why they have not fired Kudlow.  Do they think their readers are really so stupid not to see through his serial dishonesty?</p>

                                <p>This post looks at real net worth per capita.  Data on net worth is the market value of assets owned by households and non-profit organizations obtained from <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Download.aspx?rel=Z1&#038;series=bcd677e6f69f0dec61aa7c5f7e20ffb7&#038;filetype=csv&#038;label=include&#038;layout=serieslist&#038;from=01/01/1945&#038;to=12/31/2007">the Federal Reserve</a>.  The data is converted from nominal to a 2000 base year using the <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI</a>, and further divided by the population, obtained from the BEA’s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  If you’re not happy about the inclusion of non-profits, well, neither am I – this is what the Fed seems to estimate.</p>
<p>In 1945, the first year for which data is available, the average net worth (nominal) of Americans was $5,084… in 2005, it was $186,389.  Here’s what it looks like adjusted for inflation:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rw148bL0VvI/AAAAAAAAAyg/zMyhOA8On40/s1600-h/net+worth,+line+graph.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rw148bL0VvI/AAAAAAAAAyg/zMyhOA8On40/s320/net+worth,+line+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The series tends to trend upward over time, with a few blips here and there…  the biggest is at the end of the dot com bubble.  Aside from the size of the drop, the big surprise is that it went on for three years in a row, which seems very unusual.  </p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like broken out by President.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rw142bL0VuI/AAAAAAAAAyY/Jycg3D2nNcU/s1600-h/net+worth,+bar+graph+(by+president).jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rw142bL0VuI/AAAAAAAAAyY/Jycg3D2nNcU/s320/net+worth,+bar+graph+(by+president).jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And here’s a summary.</p>

<p>FYI… Nixon/Ford doesn’t show up because at 0.01%, the growth rate is just about zero.</p>
<p>So what is going on?  Clinton and JFK/LBJ top the charts.  They’re also the ones who top the charts, by some distance, on measures of economic growth<br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">economic growth</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-personal-income.html">personal income growth</a> so its not surprising net asset accumulation was fastest with them.  Reagan followed – he was fourth on economic growth, and third on personal income, <br />and he benefited from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/growth-fed-and-presidents.html">easy money</a>  so his spot is no shocker.  Ike, in fourth, is a bit of a surprise… I’m guessing that has something to do with spending on recently discharged GI programs and Levittown constructions that made accumulation of assets possible.  Additionally, Ike, was a pretty frugal sort, ranked two or three (depending on your measure) on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-national-debt.html">paying down the debt</a>; its possible that frugality was indicative of the country’s mood, or that Ike, with his bully pulpit, helped make it so.  Of the four at the bottom, GW’s poor showing is a bit of a surprise; given the very low interest rates and extremely <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/growth-fed-and-presidents.html">easy money</a> policy the Fed maintained during much of his term so far, its frankly a surprise to me accumulation of net assets hasn’t been stronger under his term.  </p>
<p>Next post on the subject… combining all the ownership society series.</p>

<p>Correction&#8230; I&#8217;m embarrassed to say when I originally posted, I uploaded the three graphs from my previous post.  Its been corrected.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/horsesmouth/2007/10/did_washington.php">Greg Sargent</a> has links to some on the left who went after something Senator Clinton seems to have said on torture – at least according to the <a href="">Washington Post</a>:   </p>
<blockquote><p>Clinton was similarly vague about how she would handle special interrogation methods used by the CIA. She said that while she does not condone torture, so much has been kept secret that she would not know unlesselected what other extreme measures interrogators are using, and therefore could not say whether she would change or continue existing policies. &#8220;It is not clear yet exactly what this administration is or isn&#8217;t doing. We&#8217;re getting all kinds of mixed messages,&#8221; Clinton said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll know the truth until we have a new president. I think [until] you can get in there and actually bore into what&#8217;s been going on, you&#8217;re not going to know.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg also notes that the Senator’s campaign quickly responded by sending over the expanded version of what she really said.  Greg ends his blog post with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s no clear reason why WaPo shouldn&#8217;t have included the extra sentence. Err on the side of more inclusion, not less, especially in a situation as sensitive as this one. Post full transcripts. There&#8217;s plenty of space for this on the internets. No reason not to do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg is being kind enough to assume that the WaPo is interested in real journalism and not Faux News.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/10/what-can-econom.html">Dani Rodrik</a> treat us to a paper by <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1014427%20">Michael Greenstone</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This paper shows how data from world financial markets can be used to shed light on the central question of whether the Surge has increased or diminished the prospect of today&#8217;s Iraq surviving into the future. In particular, I examine the price of Iraqi state bonds, which the Iraqi government is currently servicing, on world financial markets. After the Surge, there is a sharp decline in the price of those bonds, relative to alternative bonds. The decline signaled a 40% increase in the market&#8217;s expectation that Iraq will default. This finding suggests that to date the Surge is failing to pave the way toward a stable Iraq and may in fact be undermining it.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It would seem this paper was noted by <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/09/prediction-mark.html">Alex Tabarrok</a> and by <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/09/is-the-surge-wo.html#more">Mark Thoma</a>.  It also received a review from <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/is-the-surge-working-ask-the-data-not-the-politicians/#more-1886">Steve Levittt</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>I have a few thoughts after reading Greenstone’s work:<br />1. This paper shows how good economic analysis can contribute in a fundamental way to public policy. Anyone who reads Greenstone’s article will recognize that it is careful and thorough. It is even-handed and apolitical. It combines state-of-the-art data analysis techniques with economic logic (e.g., using market prices to draw conclusions about how things are going).<br />2. Top economists like Greenstone virtually never write papers like this. The simple reason is that this sort of work is not rewarded in our profession. Academic economists are judged by the papers they publish in peer-reviewed journals. The lag time between submission to these journals and publication is often two or more years. By that time, no one will be interested in the surge, so editors won’t want to publish the paper. Consequently, good economists don’t think it is worth their while to do topical work like this.<br />3. Instead, this sort of analysis tends to be done by bad economists, or economists on the payroll of special interests. These reports might appear informative, but instead are often pure propaganda. To outsiders, it is difficult to determine what is careful analysis like Greenstone has produced versus the usual junk.<br />4. The internet can potentially solve both problems (2) and (3) above, leading to an increased supply of good, timely analysis. If people like Greenstone can immediately get their findings into the public debate through the internet, it gives a real purpose (not just an academic one) to doing the work. In addition, there are now online peer-reviewed academic journals that have greatly sped the time from submission to publication, potentially increasing the academic payoff to someone like Greenstone. With many respected economists now blogging, there is also a vehicle for these folks to weigh in on the quality of policy-related economic writings — like I am doing in this blog post</p></blockquote>
<p>I can think of a good example of Steve’s #3 – how Lawrence Kudlow looks at stock market movements as proof we are winning in the Iraq.</p>

                                <p>Rush Limbaugh has been in the news lately.  So it got me to thinking about him (shudder).  I wonder what he would say if he heard someone was called up to fight in Iraq or Afghanistan who was excused from the fighting, and even the military, because he had a note from his doctor saying he had some sort of a cyst on his butt.  Add to that a detail &#8211; that there was <a href="http://www.snopes.com/military/limbaugh.asp">no record that person was ever examined by a military doctor</a>, and that the story for what happened shifted a bit over time?</p>
<p>My guess is that alone would be worth an entire show for the big patriot.</p>

                                <p>This post looks at the owner’s equity as a percentage of the value homes– it was suggested by reader Edward Charles Ponzi Jr. as a follow-up to my post on the ownership society, and another reader, M. Jed, was kind enough to point me in the direction of data.</p>
<p>Data for this post comes from the Fed…  4th quarter <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Download.aspx?rel=Z1&#038;series=23737d39332f0c1d3371335e600335dd&#038;filetype=csv&#038;label=include&#038;layout=serieslist&#038;from=03/01/1945&#038;to=12/31/2007">real estate holdings</a> and <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Download.aspx?rel=Z1&#038;series=ac98b885836e568019aeefe5a27b5483&#038;filetype=csv&#038;label=include&#038;layout=serieslist&#038;from=03/01/1945&#038;to=06/30/2007">owner’s equity</a>.  </p>
<p>Here’s what the series looks like since 1945, the first year for which data is available.  Notice…  at one point, owners’s equity, on average, was equal to about 88% of the value of a home.  That figure collapsed to 64% by 1965, at which point it started to rise again, hitting a new (local) peak at 70% in the early 1980s.  Its been mostly downhill from there, with a bit of a leveling off in the late 1990s.  </p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwwk57L0VpI/AAAAAAAAAxw/HvnNFkRnvTY/s1600-h/owner%27s+equity+summary.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwwk57L0VpI/AAAAAAAAAxw/HvnNFkRnvTY/s320/owner%27s+equity+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The only administrations under whom owner’s equity actually increased as a percentage of are Carter and Nixon/Ford.  To some extent, they owe something to JFK/LBJ, as the graph seems to indicate that the upturn began in that administration, and it wasn’t just a one-time blip.  Nixon/Ford saw a big drop from 1973 to 1974 – probably related to the big jump in inflation and perhaps the collapse of the Bretton Woods system.  Clinton followed, with the smallest drop, then JFK/LBJ, Reagan, Mr. Ownership Society, Ike, and Mr. Ownership Society&#8217;s father came in last.  </p>
<p>Overall, the conclusion is that on average, while more Americans may <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-home-ownership.html">&#8220;own&#8221;</a> their homes as time goes on, the percentage of the home they actually own outright is diminishing.    Put another way&#8230; as with a lot of things, Americans are borrowing more and more to buy more and more.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>To be consistent with the post on home ownership, I redid the figures looking at Q1 figures rather than Q4 figures&#8230; hence, JFK/LBJ runs from Q1 1961, ending in Q1 1969.  This changed the order of the Presidents slightly.  It made GW look better, lest anyone accuse me of BDS!  Note also&#8230;  data for years before 1951 is for Q4 &#8211; Q1 data was not available.  </p>
<p>Apologies.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Second update&#8230;  several readers have pointed out that I should have mentioned inflation.  They are correct&#8230;  it probably did make a difference during the Nixon/Ford and Carter years.</p>
<p>But what caused the uptick in the mid-1960s?  Maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development">this</a>, before the rampant corruption years set in?</p>

                                <p>I have always lived near Michigan and now am spending a great deal of time in the state. I hope to semi-retire near a lake with a lot of fish (but I will never be a Wolverine fan – yuck).</p>
<p>Michigan, in the throes of a six year recession, and with four years of gruesome home foreclosures, is looking for some help, any help, and moved up the presidential primary.</p>
<p>The folks here do not think New Hampshire and Iowa should decide the fate of the nation.</p>
<p>The GOP was miffed but very shortly a GOP debate will start in Michigan. It will be interesting to hear what is said about taxes, trade and jobs.</p>
<p>The Democrats are in a complete huff. AP today&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>“LANSING, Mich. &#8211; Four Democratic candidates have withdrawn from Michigan&#8217;s Jan. 15 presidential primary, leaving what amounts to a beauty contest for front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton and a handful of lesser-knowns</p>
<p>Barack Obama, John Edwards and Bill Richardson filed paperwork Tuesday, the deadline to withdraw from the ballot, said Kelly Chesney, spokeswoman for the Michigan Secretary of State&#8217;s office. A fourth candidate, Joe Biden, said in a statement that he was bypassing Michigan&#8217;s primary…..”<br /></em><br />Well, ain’t this interesting? Michigan has been a reliable blue state, but this may throw the state political scene into chaos.</p>
<p>Bad move by the Dems? Will the GOP candidates help or hurt themselves? Is Hillary helped?</p>
