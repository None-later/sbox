                                                                    </div>

                                <p>A copy of the SOTU can be found <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/01/28/embargoed-state-of-the-union-text-2">here</a>.  The President seems to think we can have balanced budgets and low taxes at the same time with earmark reform but the absurdity of all of this comes out here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely. Next week, I will send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs totaling more than $18 billion. And this budget will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012. American families have to balance their budgets, and so should their Government.</p></blockquote>
<p>But let me outsource this one to <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2008/01/budget-policy-in-sotu.html">Andrew Samwick</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had three reactions, none of them particularly favorable.  1) While I&#8217;m likely to be pleased at the details of the $18 billion in expenditure reductions, let&#8217;s not confuse that with significant spending reduction. Total (defense and nondefense) discretionary outlays in 2008 are $1,089 billion. [See Table 3-7 here and keep the file open.] So even if Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid (the bulk of the mandatory outlays, see Table 3-3 above) are held harmless, this is a reduction of 18/1089 = 1.7%. 2) While I would be happier in 2012 with a surplus than without one, this is another one of those incredibly weak budget targets. (The earlier one was to &#8220;cut the deficit in half in 5 years.&#8221;) First, it includes the Social Security surplus in 2012, projected by CBO to be about $45 billion in that year. (See Tables 4-5 and 3-3 above.) An honest budget&#8211;one that would not be &#8220;raiding&#8221; the Social Security Trust Fund&#8211;would exclude the off-budget surplus and have the entitlement programs in long-term balance. Second, the economic forecast on which this projection is based assumes positive annual growth in real GDP between now and then. [See Table 2-4 above.] So if we are experiencing positive economic growth over this period, why is it that only in 2012 do we reach the number zero? Should we not be running surpluses in every year in which growth is above its long-term average?  3) I can&#8217;t be 100% sure on this one, but it appears from Slide 11 in these slides accompanying CBO Director Peter Orszag&#8217;s testimony on the budget outlook from January 23 that if modifications to the baseline are made which are consistent with other things the President has said, we don&#8217;t come anywhere close to budget balance in 2012. The modifications made are: to exented all expiring tax provisions, make reforms to the alternative minimum tax, to assume that the number of military personnel in the war on terrorism falls to 75,000 by 2013, and to assume regular appropriations grow at the rate of nominal GDP. The first one is critical, since the President also insisted that &#8220;Unless Congress acts, most of the tax relief we&#8217;ve delivered over the past seven years will be taken away.&#8221; So the projections for surplus in 2012 are inconsistent with other policy statements the President would has made.</p></blockquote>
<p>An $18 billion reduction in earmarks is not going to offset a General Fund deficit running in excess of $500 billion per year unless we let the Bush tax cuts sunset, end the Iraq War ASAP, and do a whole lot more to reign in the fiscal irresponsibility of the past seven years.  So let’s stop pretending otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/005162.php">Paul Kiel</a> calls George W. Bush the Earmark President:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nothing was a bigger tell of the desperation here than the heroic centerpiece of Bush&#8217;s address. It&#8217;s pretty safe to say that before the Bush administration, most Americans had no idea what an earmark was. But Bush, the earmark president, the man who presided over and enabled the Republican Congress during the Jack Abramoff and Duke Cunningham scandals, changed that. And now he&#8217;s decided that he&#8217;s really going to bring the hammer down on the practice now that the Republicans no longer run Congress (actually not so much bring the hammer down as threaten to bring the hammer down right before he leaves office).</p></blockquote>
<p>Supporting evidence comes from the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2008/01/29/watchdogs_spurn_bushs_vow_of_earmark_veto/?rss_id=Boston.com+--+National+news">Boston Globe</a> and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/washington/29earmark.html?ex=1359262800&#038;en=2228a6cafef8ba99&#038;ei=5088&#038;partner=rssnyt&#038;emc=rss">New York Times</a>.  Cliff Note version: Bush is saying he and the Republicans are allowed to do earmarks but now that the Democrats are coming to power, this practice must cease.</p>

                                <p>CoRev, a frequent commentator and sometimes guest-poster here at Angry Bear, has, at his site, a <a href="http://pcrevolt.blogspot.com/2008/01/psyops-marine-style-too-funny.html">video</a> taken in Iraq.  It was obviously taken by American troops, and shows an American soldier telling a taxi driver who is stopped at a check point to go tell his insurgent friends to come attack because he&#8217;s itching to get in a firefight.</p>
<p>CoRev thinks its funny.  Having spent some years in military dictatorships, I see something different than he does.  I see a scared guy at a checkpoint, being mocked by a soldier.  In seconds, he could be dead or on his way to prison, purely on the whim of the soldier at the checkpoint.  Some of the taxi driver&#8217;s relatives have, in fact, disappeared or died &#8211; and he doesn&#8217;t know any of the circumstances surrounding how it happened.  The thought probably entered his mind, as he pulled up to the checkpoint, that maybe one or two of those relatives might have disappeared after pulling up to a checkpoint like this one, manned by soldiers like these.  So he was already afraid when he pulled up to the checkpoint and the soldier had him roll down the window to answer questions.  But once the mockery began, he became terrified.  And one more thing &#8211; if he didn&#8217;t already hate the soldier at the checkpoint and all the other soldiers like him &#8211; he does now.</p>
<p>I wonder how many times that scene plays out every day in Iraq, and I wonder how many  frightened taxi drivers there are.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/01272008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/cut_and_running_957760.htm?page=0">Max Boot</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obviously we cannot keep 170,000 troops in Iraq indefinitely; we will be down to 130,000 (15 Brigade Combat Teams) by mid-July on current projections. And as Iraqi security forces grow in capability it may be possible to withdraw more troops without compromising the security gains of recent months. But it would be the height of irresponsibility to pledge, without knowing what conditions on the ground look like, the withdrawal of all combat troops in less than two years.</p>
<p>Imagine what would have happened in the Korean peninsula if the U.S. and its allies had withdrawn all combat troops in 1955. What are the odds that South Korea would have remained independent? Probably no higher than the odds in South Vietnam, where we did withdraw all combat troops in 1973. Within two years the war was lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>Consider what he is writing&#8230;  if the US had withdrawn from Korea in 1955, yes, the North Koreans, and more importantly, the Chinese PLA would have over-run South Korea.  Now&#8230; to which of these entities would Boot like to compare Al Qaeda?  The 260,000 thousand strong North Korean military of 1955?  Perhaps the 780,000 troops China sent into battle?  And let&#8217;s not forget the 26,000 &#8220;advisors&#8221; sent by the USSR.  Oh wait&#8230; if we insist that the enemy in Iraq is Al Qaeda &#8211; all of the above.  And we can come up with a similar set of numbers for Vietnam.</p>
<p>Al Qaeda is what the Italian Red Brigades would be if fast-forwarded a few decades and stripped of Soviet help.  The way to get rid of Al Qaeda is also the way the Red Brigades were brought down &#8211; good old fashioned police work.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The most common explanation for supply-side economics is that cutting tax rates results in higher tax collections <em>via increased economic growth</em>.  But could there be another, microeconomic, mechanism as well?</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120122126173315299.html">Here</a> is Arthur B Laffer in WSJ &#8220;Tax Threat to Prosperity&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past 30 years, the U.S. has seen large changes in income tax rates as well as other tax rates. And, as would be expected, the budgetary implications of these tax changes have once again become a hotly debated partisan issue.</p>
<p>But missing from the discussion are the huge differences in how the top 1% of income earners <em>respond to changes</em> in tax rates versus, say, the bottom 75% or 80% of taxpayers &#8212; the so-called middle class and lowest income groups. The &#8220;rich&#8221; quite simply are not like the rest of us. <em>(italics mine).</em><br />&#8230;the very highest income earners are and have always been able to vary their reported income and thus control the amount of taxes they pay. Whether through tax shelters, deferrals, gifts, write-offs, cross income mobility or any of a number of other measures, the effective average tax rate barely budges. But this group&#8217;s total tax payments are incredibly volatile.</p></blockquote>
<p>In  other words, lowering marginal tax rates at the upper end results in higher tax collections <em>by reducing incentives for tax avoidance</em>.  When evaluating tax shelters a major variable is &#8220;Marginal Tax Rate.&#8221;  The lower that number is the more likely they are to ship the money to the government. </p>
<p>If there is anything worse for economic growth than high taxes, it is shifting resources to non-economic tax shelters. </p>
<p>(There is a PhD dissertation waiting to be written on the effect of taxation (ie. 1031 exchange) on the real estate bubble).</p>

<p>This was by Sammy.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my response, fwiw.  Regular readers know I worked for a year at what is now one of the Big 4 accounting firms &#8211; it was my first job after grad school and I really didn&#8217;t like it at all.  But I learned a lot about how the world works.  And once I figured out what the company really did, I really wasn&#8217;t able to do my job very well.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a purely hypothetical story.  The partner to whom I indirectly reported was what was known in the firm&#8217;s parlance as a POGI &#8211; a Partner of Great Importance &#8211; to be distinguished from a PONI &#8211; a Partner of No Importance.  One day, he gave a presentation to all of us who reported to him (plus a lot of people that didn&#8217;t).  In the meeting, he told us about a, well, I&#8217;ll call it a plan, enacted for a Major Hypothetical Client.  Major Hypothetical Client was and continues to be a household name in pretty much any country in the world other than North Korea, and if I had to guess, one of the ten or so most recognizable brands in the world.  Major Client makes products that, from what I can tell, are no better or worse than the products made by its competitors, but when the Major Hypothetical Client&#8217;s name and logo are slapped on these products, they increase in value five-fold.  Sometimes more.  At least that seems to be the premium customers are willing to pay for that name and logo.</p>
<p>Anyway, the plan, and I repeat that this story is purely hypothetical, was more or less the following &#8211; part ownership of the logo was transferred to Major Hypothetical Company of Bermuda (or the Bahamas or some tax shelter in the Caribbean) through some convoluted scheme that involved payments being made back and forth between the parent company and the sub, but in such a way that the net of those payments equaled zero.  But&#8230;  because in the tax shelter taxes were essentially zero (and why not &#8211; the subsidiary was nothing more than a post office box so any income received by the tax shelter country was free), Major Hypothetical Client was now able to make a substantial part of its income subject to an infinitesimal tax.  Total cost cost:  whatever fees they paid their accounting firm.</p>
<p>The group that serviced High Net Worth individuals was down the hall, and I heard they did similar things for their clients.  Which means&#8230;  say you&#8217;re the heir to a large fortune.  You have a trust fund that generates $20 million a year.  You have two options:</p>
<p>1.  Pay one of the big accounting firms a fee (say, $100,000 a year) and see your income essentially exempt from taxes<br />2.  Don&#8217;t use these tax avoidance schemes and pay taxes like anyone else</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re the sort of person who is willing to use these tax avoidance schemes &#8211; and I would hazard to guess that not that many people in that situation are not &#8211; how low do tax rates have to be in order that you do not engage in those schemes?  The answer:  half a percent.  Guess how low tax rates would have to be for someone making $200 million a year not to use the same schemes.</p>
<p>So&#8230; if the approach is to count on the goodwill of people who would otherwise employ those who can use what I like to think of as legalized fraud, Laffer is essentially arguing not only for a regressive tax system, but a very, very regressive tax system.  </p>
<p>A better approach &#8211; end all these loopholes.  All of them.</p>

                                <p>In the neighborhoods where I spend any time at all, I&#8217;ve noticed two things.  One is that there are a lot of places for sale these days.  Another, and this is more of a surprise, is that there are a lot of signs indicating there are places for rent.  (BTW &#8211; this is not just residential, I&#8217;m starting to see it for commercial places too.)  I would have assumed that you see either more sales or more rentals unless people are abandoning the area.  But it doesn&#8217;t seem to me &#8211; and I should note &#8211; this is purely an observation I&#8217;m making Austrian Economics style (i.e., I haven&#8217;t looked at any data) &#8211; that people are abandoning Los Angeles County, and if they are, has the exodus really increased that much in the past two months or so? </p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on?  Anyone have any ideas?  I have a vague recollection (I&#8217;ve been so swamped lately my memory has been very feeble) of something like this being mentioned at <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">Calculated Risk</a> but I couldn&#8217;t find it.</p>

                                <p>I can&#8217;t listen to any more of this prattle so I turned off the tv.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t get&#8230;  GW said something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>And this budget will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012. American families have to balance their budgets and so should their Government.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wonderful.  This raises a few questions:</p>
<p>1.  Why should we care about his plan for what happens in 2012?  Its not like he&#8217;s going to be in office then.  And he seems to have picked a date far enough in the future that he has zero control over what happens for most of the time period between now and then.  He might as well promise me there will be a goat sitting on my desk laying golden eggs.  If either promise happens, it won&#8217;t be because of anything GW does or doesn&#8217;t do.<br />2.  Even if he was in office in 2012, why would he be any more likely to follow it than his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">earlier promise</a> to pay down debt aggressively and have us on the path to paying off the debt completely by 2011?<br />3.  If Government should have to balance its budget, and Government was balancing its budget before he took office, and he thinks Government will again balance its budget after he leaves office, isn&#8217;t it kind of obvious what the problem is?</p>
<p>One other thing he mentioned that I&#8217;m in favor of&#8230; I don&#8217;t like the idea that Congress can pass laws that have spending components that haven&#8217;t been voted on at all.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Oh <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080128/ap_on_go_co/economy_stimulus">good grief</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Still, pressure from the elderly and labor unions &#8211; both politically potent forces &#8211; is spurring senators from both parties to call for the extras. The House plan leaves out some 20 million seniors, according to the AARP &#8230; Some senators also were pressing to add to the business tax breaks in the package, including restoring a measure dropped during the House negotiations that would let businesses suffering losses now to reclaim taxes previously paid.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before I rip into this political pandering, let me try to say a few nice things (if I can).   I was hoping that Senate tinkering would increase the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/fiscal-stimulus-senator-dodd-wants-more.html">bang for the buck</a>.  And maybe a non-Ricardian version of the Life Cycle Model of consumption has seniors with a higher marginal propensity to consume tax rebates.  But remember that I’m sort of a member of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/coalition-against-fiscal-stimulus.html">Greg Mankiw’s Coalition</a> with at least this minimal qualification for any package that comes out of Congress:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’d prefer a fiscal stimulus package that does offer more bang for less bucks.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it does seem that the politicians want more bucks, which means more debt passed onto our kids.  Maybe Lawrence Summers was right to call for some fiscal stimulus, but the kind of political pandering that has ensued is just making me even more Angry.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: BNA writes that Max Baucus might be listening:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) announced a $156 billion economic stimulus proposal Jan. 28 that would offer flat $500 tax rebate checks to individuals, rather than rebates of up to $600 as proposed in the House, and include an extension of unemployment insurance. Unlike the compromise package agreed to between the White House and House leadership on Jan. 24, the Baucus proposal &#8211; which will serve as the chairman&#8217;s mark for a Jan. 30 Finance Committee mark up &#8211; also would expand the rebate checks to people who only get their income from Social Security. </p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, he will be hammered by the GOP spin machine but proposing to reduce the $600 to $500 for those who are not liquidity constrained so as to offer more to those who are strikes me as good economics – assuming we need fiscal stimulus.</p>

                                <p>I have enjoyed the comments on economics from fellow vowel-less economist KNZN but his <a href="http://knzn.blogspot.com/2008/01/deficit-is-good.html">latest</a> <a href="http://knzn.blogspot.com/2008/01/what-is-purpose-of-fiscal-stimulus.html">two</a> posts on fiscal stimulus have me scratching my head.  One claims that the Bush fiscal fiasco was a good thing:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can reasonably complain about the composition of expenditures or the composition of revenues under the fiscal policies of the last 7 years. But if you think the existence of a deficit – I mean a large deficit – has been a bad thing, you are just wrong. Back in 2006, I went into a lot of theoretical reasons why the deficit might be a good thing. But in the light of the housing crisis, it has become clear to me that there is a very simple reason why the deficit really has been a good thing: we have needed a fiscal stimulus this whole time (except maybe for, hmm, say February and March of 2006).</p></blockquote>
<p>One could counter that an easier monetary policy (the FED did raise short-term interest rates starting in late 2004) could have generated more investment demand as well as a dollar that depreciated even more, which would have increased net exports.  But KNZN notes that we did rely on low interest rates, which he claims led to the current housing fiasco.  Later we get from KNZN what the real purpose of fiscal stimulus:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the purpose of a fiscal stimulus were to stimulate aggregate demand and thereby increase economic activity, then a fiscal stimulus would almost never be a good idea &#8230; anything that fiscal policy can do, monetary policy can do better. And monetary policy will do it, because that’s the job of central bankers. And if you disagree with the central bank about whether we need a stimulus, it will do you no good to try to use fiscal policy unilaterally, because the central bank will act to offset the effect with higher interest rates. There is one exception – one case where monetary policy (maybe) just doesn’t work: that is the case where the interest rate is zero … But a monetary stimulus could have another bad effect – rising import prices due to sudden drop in the dollar. The way to avoid that effect is to keep US interest rates high enough to attract capital from abroad, which will prop up the dollar. And the way to do that is with fiscal policy – a policy to produce a demand for that capital, so that someone in the US will be willing to pay those interest rates. Again, the purpose of a fiscal stimulus is to prevent interest rates from going down.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, low interest rates are bad because we like our current account deficit so much that we have to avoid anything that will increase net exports?  Also note that a high interest rate policy is one that crowds out investment.  OK – if our incredibly low national savings rate is already too much savings, we do need some long-term fiscal stimulus.  I guess KNZN has just rationalized the last 27 years of GOP fiscal policy!</p>

                                <p>Krugman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/opinion/28krugman.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">Lessons of 1992</a> must be heeded.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;if the next president doesn’t arrive with a plan that is broadly workable in outline, by the time the thing gets fixed the window of opportunity may well have passed</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, Krugman skirts the larger issue&#8211;the one at the core of many of our problems: Power brokers&#8211;powerful ex politicians, ex-governmental appointees and ex-military who now sell their services and influence to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>Edwards refuses to take money from PACS; the same cannot be said of Hillary and Obama.<br />I was going to do a satirical pillow talk sketch between Hillary and Bill before or after she had been elected.</p>
<p>Bill, in case you do not know, has become a lobbyist, a lobbyist for Dubai. Imagine: An ex-president, the husband of the President, doing bedtime lobbying in the White House. Both Bill and Bob Dole took money to promote Dubai&#8217;s interest in the 22 port deal that caused such a ruckus a year or so ago.</p>
<p>Hillary, who once tried to develop a real health care plan, now is in bed with the pharmaceuticals. Have you all forgotten who actually wrote the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003?</p>
<p>Obama says he can deal with the drug companies and special interests. What’s he going to do? Pose for them? Is he naïve or what? Granted he does take a great picture: Noble, eyes focused above the crowd, looking, I am sure, at some heavenly city on a hill to which he will certainly lead us. How easily we are gulled by poses.</p>
<p>When he called the Canadian premier a president, I winced. Oh no, not another know-nothing. What does the man really know? I could be accused of quibbling here; we all make mistakes. What does stick in my craw is Krugman’s point—and the money thing. Obama looks visionary; it’s just a pose.</p>
<p>There is a reason Edwards has not gotten airtime. He doesn&#8217;t take the money. He gets my vote. The guy has class.</p>
<p>I give you all two numbers, executive orders: 12834 &#8211;1993 and 13184 –2000. They frame the Clinton presidency. At one time I was Clinton fan.</p>
<p>Google them. Learn something.</p>
<p>After you Google them, remember where he gets his money now.</p>
<p>America is for sale. I find it despicable.</p>
<p>Touch the big moneyed interests and you will find yourself corrupted. Foreign interests are gobbling us up from the outside; politicians, ex-government officials, and ex-military are selling us from the inside.</p>
<p>Henry Kissfinger, for whom does he lobby? Bob Dole? All of them&#8230;. This is not my America.<br />Movie Guy sent me a piece by McCain, describing a POW stitching together an American flag, even after his captors had brutally punished him for doing so. McCain concludes his story saying that we say the pledge with pride. Oh?</p>
<p>For this reason, apparently, we should say the pledge with pride. Well, I am fast losing my pride in the real America, the slim fest that now orgies in the nation&#8217;s capital. I don&#8217;t care if I vote for someone who will lose&#8211;I don&#8217;t bet on horses. I want my vote to have some honor attached to it. I want an America of which I can be proud.</p>
<p>Imagine if Hillary wins. Imagine the pillowtalk with her husband the lobbyist, the ex-President.<br />Have we no shame left? This is where we have arrived, folks.</p>
<p>Bill and Hillary are not the ugly exceptions; they are the norm. That simple image&#8211;the two of them cozy under the blankets &#8211;is a metaphor for what is happening throughout Washington. Why doesn&#8217;t the media pick this up, even the liberal media? You know the reasons. Only a fool would refuse to see it; only a scoundrel would try to justify it.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.acslaw.org/files/Vladeck%20Issue%20Brief.pdf">The American Constitutional Society</a> has published a white paper about real action versus professed belief of administrative fiat.  Transparency is not part of either.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bush Administration has been quietly waging a campaign to dramatically reconfigure American tort law by claiming that routine regulatory action taken by federal agencies has the effect of preempting state law damages claims. The campaign has been remarkable not just because of its scope, but also because it has attracted virtually no public attention. </p>
<p>Why has the campaign gone essentially unnoticed? Because the Administration does not seek to change tort law through transparent means, like the enactment of a federal law or the adoption of regulations. Instead, it has resorted to simply including statements in lengthy and obscure preambles in Federal Register notices that regulatory action taken by an array of federal agencies — the Food and Drug Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Administration, to name a few — broadly preempts state law. One commentator has aptly dubbed this campaign “preemption by preamble.”</p>
<p>The concern here is not with agencies expressing their position on the preemptive effect of their regulatory actions. That is unobjectionable, and, in many instances, unavoidable. What is objectionable is that agencies are making substantive preemption determinations in a way that is neither transparent nor democratic, and are doing so because the Administration has determined that insulating big business from tort litigation is right as a matter of federal policy. Invariably, in making these pro-preemption determinations, the agency is repudiating longstanding agency policy to the contrary.</p>
<p>This White Paper is intended to serve two purposes: First, to inform readers that this campaign is well-underway and sketch out, albeit briefly, some of the serious policy implications that it raises; and second, to explain why making preemption determinations by regulatory fiat raises serious separation of powers and agency capture concerns.</p></blockquote>
<p>1. What is happening to our flamer&#8217;s favorite remedy?<br />2. Agency capture is an interesting term.<br />3. Who is swallowing whom?</p>

                                <p>Since PGL links to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/coalition-against-fiscal-stimulus.html">Mankiw</a>, I will too.  <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/01/dont-believe-every-rumor-journalists.html">Here</a> he is telling us he&#8217;s not in the running for head of the NBER.  Good thing too&#8230;  I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if an NBER led by Greg Mankiw would move the 2001 recession into 1999, and the 1990-1991 recession to 1993-1994.  Heck, <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p_ax_fywYILjfd0iajk-dMA">this entire record would have to change</a>, wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>But enough speculation about what would have been, let&#8217;s cut to what is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why did I decide not to pursue the job? As in many such decisions in life, various factors were at play, both personal and professional. But what really pushed me over the edge was pending tax policy. With the Bush tax cuts set to expire in a couple years, I am looking for ways to reduce my taxable income.</p></blockquote>
<p>All I can say is that its unfortunate that one of the architects of the current economy can&#8217;t share in the bounty he helped create.  Most lucky duckies have already  <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p07ar.html">seen their income fall</a> from where it was before GW started with his tax cuts and tax rebates.</p>
<p>There really is no justice in this world.  And apparently not much of a sense of shame left either.</p>
