<p>This will soon be the new look for Angry Bear, and a switch to the wordpress platform from blogger will add considerably to functions.  Our advertisements are also missing.  The side bar functions will soon be completed (not in picture), and include a blogroll and archives. </p>
<p>The top category bar functions can be used to separate out posts from each other for reader convenience, and are color coded. An example of a hot topic can be the current writing stemming from Newtown, Ct. news and related data for the issue, which is not strictly economic in nature but well worth discussing.  The category Politics might be used to address the more political in the term political &#8216;economics&#8217;.</p>
<p>More to come.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>No, not <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/">Dr. Black’s blog</a>.  The <em>real </em>eschaton: the end of everything.  Or, in this case, its economics equivalent: the point at which almost all human work is no longer necessary but human beings still exist.
<p>The scenario is a simple one.  There are x humans on Earth (x>>1).  Self-repairing, recycling machines can provide all the needs and wants of those x people and then some.*  There is only one job humans need to do: every day, one person needs to press one button once&#8211;during a specific time period—to start the self-rebuilding and repairing of the machines.</p>
<p>Applying basic micro and macro economic theories, and assuming a money-using society, we can come to several stylized facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is the true case where Chamley (1995, 1996) applies.  The only capital created is exactly that that replaces current capital.  With no new capital, the effective tax rate on capital should be 0%.**     </li>
<li>The requirement that someone presses the button has two aspects:</li>
<ol>
<li>It is not required to be skilled labor</li>
<li>It is, however, essential labor</li>
</ol>
<li>In standard economic theory, the laborer is paid hisser Marginal Product</li>
<ol>
<li>The pressing of the button provides all of the goods to everyone for that day; since there is no MPK in this scenario, the MPL should equal the net profits from that day.</li>
<li>Pressing the button requires the laborer to choose to do the job instead of something more pleasant; therefore, they must be compensated to provide at least as much Utility as not pushing the button would provide them</li>
<li>For a sufficiently large population x, there may well be people who will not press the button in their lifetimes.  For even relatively large x, there will be people who will press the button less frequently than they will need to buy goods.</li>
<ol>
<li>In either of those scenarios—unless we consider Malthusian constraints necessary in a time of abundant plenty—any equilibrium condition will require that each person and any of hisser dependents be supported s.t. AD does not decline.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>The natural scenario for button-pushing selection is by lottery, which would also minimize the substitution effect. Some constraints would be required: may not repeat for at least z days, cannot sell/buyout of doing the job (though some intraweek switching possible), backup available in case of illness,*** etc.</p>
<p>What is interesting is the tax rate <em>t</em> required.  It is fairly easy to show that for even moderate populations, <em>t </em>must approach 100% if the laborer is indeed receiving the day’s MPL.****  This is in part because, since no new capital is being created, tax revenues from capital must approach 0%.</p>
<p>The problem then becomes one of Game Theory.  We know what the Final State must be if all activity leading up to it is rational.  The next question is how we get there.  But that will have to be deferred to my next post.</p>
<p>Enjoy the Holiday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*Excess capacity needs to be assumed if you assume humans are still breeding; that is, an additional y babies (y<<x) will neither strain resources nor have more than a marginal effect on AD.</p>
<p>**It is caddish of me to note that Chamley’s brilliant realization that has been the underpinning of several decades of freshwater economic theory is, of course, completely reflected in the U.S. tax code, where investment is offset directly by depreciation.</p>
<p>***Anyone who designs a non-redundant system with a Single Point of Failure should be shot. The applicability of this to economic models, and most especially microeconomic models, is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>****It is also intuitive that a large consumption tax would not be a reasonable substitute for such an income tax; even a “luxury tax” presents significant timing issues for even a small population.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Brad DeLong and Paul Krugman are having a mini debate on whether Brad et al (that means the Clinton administration) had good reason to fear bond vigilantes in the 90s. Krugman wrote tht they did not.*</p>
<p>Krugman phrases Brad&#8217;s argument as high deficits cause high inflation which causes tight money.   He notes that the inflation implies high nominal interest rates and low real interest rates so it should cause high demand now and writes <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/bond-vigilantes-and-the-power-of-three">&#8220;It’s not at all easy to tell a coherent story in which the effect of future expected deficits on today’s interest rates is contractionary &#8220;</a> I&#8217;m not going to let a challenge like that get by me.  On the spot, without using pen or paper I try 2</p>
<p>1) Very political economy  and trying to read Greenspan&#8217;s mind of the time.   Greenspan would have punished Congress and Clinton for disobeying his command to cut the deficit with high interest rates.  Note I make no reference to inflation.  In fact, in my model, I assume there is no inflation.  Monetary authorities using tight money to punish elected officials for violating Austerian doctrine strikes me as totally obviously what regularly happens (note your discussion of episodes of alleged expansionary austerity, in any case deficit reduction followed by high growth and speculate as to why Alesina claims that spending cuts work better than tax increases). </p>
<p>Basically the story that we have to do what Greenspan says or he will make US workers suffer makes a whole lot of sense to me.</p>
<p>2) Hmm I will assume that productive capital depreciates very quickly (and so is just a material input reall) so long term interest rates matter only for home construction (this is just an unrealistically for exposition strong version of something you wrote here) .  I will assume that the home equity loan (heloc) market is not developed and people think of taking a second mortgage as a desperate last resort (I think this was true in 1993). Finally assume extreme nominal wage rigidity.  Really assume that medium income economic agents assume extreme nominal wage rigidity so inflation implies low real wages.   In fact, assume nominal wages are permanently fixed so inflation is high prices for while but is eventually followed by deflation to get real wages back to normal.  A couple with low financial wealth considers buying a house.  The relevant real interest rate is the nominal rate corrected for wage inflation.  Oh that&#8217;s the nominal rate.</p>
<p>Yes someone has to have financial wealth.  I assume people accumulate it after paying off their mortgage.  These people would face a negative real interest rate.  There would be the effect of the change in real interest rates on their consumption.  I assert that the effect of real interest rates on consumption  is negligible.  This can be modeled assuming those with financial wealth are rentiers without labor income and that they have logarithmic utility.  But I assert that it is clear from the data and that any discussion of important effects of real interest rates on consumption and saving is proof of detachment from reality.</p>
<p>Here the story really is that what  depends on interest rates is housing and that the housing market depends on the ratio of a monthly mortgage payment (notably nominal) and current wages.  It does require sophisticated investors in the bond market and unsophisticated home buyers (given the other assumptions that&#8217;s just to rule out the heloc borrow from Peter to pay Paul strategy).</p>
<p>I think this second story is the truth, nothing but the truth, and the only truths that are relevant to the debate which I call for Brad.</p>

                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">We have got to calm down and not take tragedies like this, crimes like this, and use them for political purposes.</p>
<p>&#8212; Grover Norquist, <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/274461-norquist-accuses-obama-of-politicizing-sandy-hook-school-shooting">yesterday</a></div>
<p>I agree.  We also shouldn’t, say, take tragedies like the hijacking of four commercial planes and deliberately crashing them into huge buildings with large numbers of people inside them, and use them for political purposes.  Or take the sudden, near-complete collapse of the banking system and use it for political purposes.  Or take a steep economic downturn and resultant high unemployment rate, and use these for political purposes.  Or take the large federal fiscal deficit and debt, and use those for political purposes.</p>
<p>We should, however, address the problems that these and other occurrences and facts notify us about or highlight.  And when, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the Bush administration and Congress, with bipartisan participation and support, enacted sweeping legislation to try to address our vulnerability to terrorist attacks, neither Bush nor the congressional supporters of the legislation was politicizing 9/11.  That is, they were not using that terrorist attack to try to push through legislation whose actual purpose was something other than its advertised purpose.  Which is what the term “politicization” means.  </p>
<p>This is apart from whether you (or I) think that legislation, or any other legislation, is wise or is, instead, say, excessive and harmful in important respects (as many people, I among them, thought, and think, much of the post-9/11 legislation is).   The officeholders, including Bush, who pushed for the legislation did so for the purpose they said: to reduce our vulnerability to terrorists, not to achieve some unrelated political or ideological goal.  </p>
<p>Bush did soon unabashedly politicize 9/11, most glaringly by encouraging the false belief that Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9/11 in order to garner public support for the invasion of Iraq, but also in the non-security-related domestic arena.  But at least the former was national-security related (or so it was claimed), and the latter was not overt.</p>
<p>Similarly, with the TARP legislation, its stated purpose was its actual purpose, which was to save the financial system from near-total collapse, and it was supported not just by the Republican president but, in Congress, by many members of each party.  But this also was true of the stimulus law enacted in early 2009 and the Dodd-Frank law, both of these supported almost exclusively by Democrats.  Just as it was true of the New Deal legislation, such as the Securities Exchange Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, whose stated and actual purpose was to address the causes of the financial collapse, and the Works Progress Act and other classic Keynesian New Deal laws, whose stated and real goal was to alleviate some of the effects of the downturn and spur growth of the economy.  </p>
<p>Grover Norquist, of course, of all people, well knows the difference between using a pretext for pushing and enacting legislation for an unrelated purpose, and, instead, pushing legislation whose stated and actual purposes are the same.  He has led a decades-long campaign of deceit founded upon the false claim that the call for federal reductions in spending is an attempt to eliminate the federal debt&#8211;a purpose obviously incompatible with Norquist’s primary goal of eliminating income taxes on the wealthy and corporations.  Unless, of course, his companion goal also is achieved: eliminating the social safety net and most federal agencies, such as the EPA, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, and (to borrow a phrase from Mitt Romney) what have you.</p>
<p>What have we, of course, would be a country and society that most Americans would find repugnant, and a substantial majority of the public now sees that.  What have we, also, is a profoundly dishonest political <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svengali">Svengali</a> who, after decades of substantial but not complete success in achieving his aims, is finally witnessing his stranglehold on American politics and government pried loose, leaving him at loose ends and gasping for that final breath. </p>
<p>The problem with that final, gasping breath is that it&#8217;s too obviously ridiculous.  There probably just aren&#8217;t very many people, even among gun-rights zealots, who think Obama and the Democrats are trying to enact laws prohibiting the sale to the public of military-style assault rifles and huge ammunition clips in order to achieve anti-global-warming policy regulations, or something.  Most people, even, I suspect, most NRA members, do understand that there is a connection between mass-shooting rampages and the <i>issue</i> of gun-control policy, even if they disagree about the utility of gun-control laws.  That&#8217;s because they recognize that mass-shooting rampages do actually have something to do with guns. </p>

<blockquote><p>Actually, the NRA&#8217;s power has been waning since at least 2005 when it declared a boycott against ConocoPhillips, a major Oklahoma employer with 3,000 workers, for blocking its bring-your-gun-to-work efforts. &#8220;ConocoPhillips went to federal court to attack your freedom,&#8221; thundered Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive vice president and CEO. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to make ConocoPhillips the example of what happens when a corporation takes away your Second Amendment rights. If you are a corporation that&#8217;s anti-gun, anti-gun owner, or anti-Second Amendment, we will spare no effort or expense to work against you, to protect the rights of your law-abiding employees<br />&#8230;</p>
<p>The bring-your-gun-to-work bullying did not even fly in the &#8220;Gunshine State,&#8221; Florida. &#8220;Possession of firearms in the workplace or on company property is strictly prohibited,&#8221; said Bruce Middlebrooks of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, which has 7,500 employees in the Jacksonville area. &#8220;We&#8217;re not against the Second Amendment, but guns are inappropriate in our workplaces and workplaces include parking lots,&#8221; said Randy Miller, a lobbyist for the Florida Retail Federation which represents 12,000 businesses in the state.<br />Bring-your-gun-to-work efforts were so over the top, with hundreds a year already killed in workplace shootings, the American Bar Association challenged its legality.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>There is still a lot of headline material concerning the role of guns in our lives, and a lot of anecdotal material and thoughts abound.  Also I seem to note an increase in the reporting of <a target="_blank" href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/24/16125861-4-volunteer-firefighters-shot-2-killed-in-apparent-trap?lite">police in Lakewood, Washington</a> and <a target="+_blank" href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/24/16125861-4-volunteer-firefighters-shot-2-killed-in-apparent-trap?lite">firemen in Webster, NY</a> murders by gun makes the news as well.  We are a site that also values data to help in policy decisions as we try to govern ourselves. Hence this article from JAMA caught my attention on the apparent lack of more specific data on injuries and deaths from media.</p>
<p><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1487470" title="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1487470">The Journal of the American Medical Association</a> notes in <i>Silencing the Science on Gun Research</i> that basic gahering and reporting data was defunded and/or forbidden by government agencies including the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, Hational Institute of Health, and other Department of Health agencies. The following is an excerpt:<br />(hat tip reader Tom B.)</p>
<blockquote><p>The nation might be in a better position to act if medical and public health researchers had continued to study these issues as diligently as some of us did between 1985 and 1997. But in 1996, pro-gun members of Congress mounted an all-out effort to eliminate the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Although they failed to defund the center, the House of Representatives removed $2.6 million from the CDC&#8217;s budget—precisely the amount the agency had spent on firearm injury research the previous year. Funding was restored in joint conference committee, but the money was earmarked for traumatic brain injury. The effect was sharply reduced support for firearm injury research.</p>
<p>To ensure that the CDC and its grantees got the message, the following language was added to the final appropriation: “none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.”<sup><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/#ref-jvp120140-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Precisely what was or was not permitted under the clause was unclear. But no federal employee was willing to risk his or her career or the agency&#8217;s funding to find out. Extramural support for firearm injury prevention research quickly dried up. Even today, 17 years after this legislative action, the CDC&#8217;s website lacks specific links to information about preventing firearm-related violence.</p>
<p>When other agencies funded high-quality research, similar action was taken. In 2009, Branas et al<sup><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/#ref-jvp120140-5">5</a></sup> published the results of a case-control study that examined whether carrying a gun increases or decreases the risk of firearm assault. In contrast to earlier research, this particular study was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Two years later, Congress extended the restrictive language it had previously applied to the CDC to all Department of Health and Human Services agencies, including the National Institutes of Health.<sup><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/#ref-jvp120140-6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>The US military is grappling with an increase in suicides within its ranks. Earlier this month, an article by 2 retired generals—a former chief and a vice chief of staff of the US Army— asked Congress to lift a little-noticed provision in the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act that prevents military commanders and noncommissioned officers from being able to talk to service members about their private weapons, even in cases in which a leader believes that a service member may be suicidal.<sup><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/#ref-jvp120140-9">9</a></sup><br /><sup></sup>…<br />Given the chance, could researchers achieve similar progress with firearm violence? It will not be possible to find out unless Congress rescinds its moratorium on firearm injury prevention research. Since Congress took this action in 1997, at least 427 000 people have died of gunshot wounds in the United States, including more than 165 000 who were victims of homicide.<sup><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/#ref-jvp120140-1">1</a></sup> To put these numbers in context, during the same time period, 4586 Americans lost their lives in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.<sup><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/#ref-jvp120140-10">10</a></sup></p></blockquote>

The correlation is pretty clear: more guns, more gun deaths.<br />But I was also wondering about correlation within the U.S., by state. I’m pleased to find that Sam Wang’s <a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2012/12/22/scientific-americans-gun-error/">got it</a>:<br /><a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2012/12/22/scientific-americans-gun-error/"><img alt="Scientific American’s gun error" height="393" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/gun_ownership_deaths_500px.jpg" width="500"></a><br />I’d say that great minds think alike, but really: Sam — a professor at Princeton — has got it <em>all</em> over me when it comes to drawing valid conclusions from statistical data.* For instance: like Nate Silver, he called <em>every state</em> correctly in the recent presidential election. But his stated confidence level was way above Nate’s — between a 99.2 and 100% chance that Obama would be re-elected. That’s putting your reputation where your predictions are.<br />Read Sam’s <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/guns-murders-and-the-rule-of-law-running-the-numbers.html">post</a> and the one preceding it. He makes all sorts of sense. He also gives us the sources, so I thought I’d show the data a couple of other ways. How about…red states vs blue states? Here you go:</p>

Here it is on a map:<br /><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-shot-2012-12-24-at-6.35.25-AM.png"><img alt="Screen shot 2012-12-24 at 6.35.25 AM" height="257" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-shot-2012-12-24-at-6.35.25-AM.png" width="472"></a><br />Though I find that Richard Florida has <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/07/geography-gun-violence/2655/">beat me to it</a> on this one:<br /><a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/07/geography-gun-violence/2655/"><img alt="" height="308" src="http://cdn.theatlanticcities.com/img/upload/2012/07/20/GunDeaths.jpg" width="400"></a><br />You can quibble all you want about correlation and causation, but the simple fact is: if you live in a red state <em>the odds of your children dying of gun violence is 75% higher</em> than if you live in a blue state.<br />That may help explain why, when Americans vote with their feet and choose where to live, only 38% vote for red states.<br />It may also help explain why people in red states want guns so much: it’s <em>dangerous</em> to live in a red state. They’ve got all those guns.<br />I’m still asking: would you rather “feel” safe, or would you rather be safe?<br />* “<strong>Prof. Sam Wang</strong>‘s academic specialties are biophysics and neuroscience.

<div dir="ltr">House Republicans argue that voters handed their members a mandate as well, granting the party control of the House for another two years and with it the right to stick to their own views, even when they clash strongly with the president’s.</div>
<div dir="ltr">And many Republicans remember well when the tables were turned. After Mr. Bush’s re-election in 2004, Democrats eagerly thwarted his push for privatization of Social Security, hobbling Mr. Bush’s domestic agenda in the first year of his second term.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/us/politics/still-bitter-about-election-republican-opposition-unwilling-to-compromise-with-president.html?partner=rss&#038;emc=rss&#038;src=igw&#038;_r=0">Events Recall a More Bipartisan Era, and Highlight Gridlock of Today</a>, Michael D. Shear, New York Times, today. </div>
<p>Whoa.  Funny, but I too remember the weeks following the 2004 presidential election. Which immediately followed the 2004 presidential campaign.  Which I also remember; it wasn’t all that long ago.  
<div></div>
<div>And I remember that during that campaign, Bush never mentioned his plan to privatize Social Security.  </p>
<p>Yes, that’s right.  Bush waited until immediately after the election to announce his intention to privatize Social Security&#8211;outraging not just Democrats but millions of Independents, some of whom had voted for him, and even some Republicans.  </p>
<p>The main focus of the 2004 presidential campaign was national security.  Privatization of Social Security was not an issue at all in 2004.  Not until after the campaign, that is, when Bush not only announced his plan but also then campaigned intensely for public support for it, to no avail.  The proposal quickly proved deeply unpopular.  And congressional Republicans began to run from it.  The Republicans, who controlled both houses of Congress, did not even put it up for a vote, in either house, if I recall correctly. </p>
<p>So if Republicans think they remember that the tables were turned&#8211;a metaphor that refers to actual similarity, or at least some semblance of it&#8211;they might consider seeing a neurologist.  Or maybe just reading news accounts from the period between Bush’s announcement of his proposal and the death of that proposal early in 2005.  They also can search for reports of any mention&#8211;any suggestion at all&#8211;by Bush during the campaign that he was planning to propose the privatization of Social Security.  I wish them luck.</p>
<p>As for their claim to a mandate because they retained control of the House, the speciousness of this assertion has already been documented and discussed in the mainstream media, largely because a Washington Post reporter (I wish I could recall his name, but I can’t) meticulously researched the campaign results, congressional district by congressional district, and then did something that modern Republicans don’t: math.  Republicans lost, albeit narrowly, the aggregate popular vote in House elections nationwide.  They retained control of the House only because of extreme gerrymandering last year in some states, most notably in Pennsylvania and Texas, but in other states as well.  </p>
<p>The word “mandate” in this context leaves room for debate about what percentage of victory in the popular vote constitutes one.  But a victory in the popular is a prerequisite to that debate.  The Republicans don’t have the prerequisite, nor do they claim to have it; they simply misuse the word “mandate”.  Like so many other words.  </p>
<p>But at least it’s not false for them to note that they did retain control of the House.  What is baldly false, though, is their characterization of late 2004 and early 2005 as tables turned.  Unless, of course, there’s such a thing as a retroactive mandate for a policy that wasn’t disclosed during a campaign and is announced as a surprise only afterward.  Immediately afterward. </p>
<p>Which, now that I think about it, probably is what happened in 2004.  no, the public isn’t clairvoyant.  But we did know during the campaign that a Republican president and a Republican-controlled Congress in the current era will always want to privatize Social Security, and will waste no time (literally, in that case) in trying to do that when they hold the White House and majorities in both congressional houses.  We just forgot that, to our near-detriment&#8211;a mistake that, I trust, we the public won’t make again, however much Republican candidates insist otherwise during the campaign.  Because the Dem candidates will remind the public, during the campaign, of what happened after the election of 2004.  And of the current congressional Republicans’ claim in that New York Times article that a clear election victory is not a mandate on issues that were at the express and constant heart of a national campaign, because, after all, the opposition party doesn’t recognize as a mandate a vital policy proposal made only after the election that retroactively turned out to be all about that vital policy issue after all.  I mean, who knew?  Well, the Republicans did.</p>
<p>And now we do too, and it will be a prominent factor in campaigns to come.  The sheer trickery;  the attempt, in 2004 and now, to utterly undermine the very concept of democracy.  The current congressional Republicans’ express equating, as Shear reports, of a policy issue clearly at the heart of a campaign with a policy not even mentioned during the campaign.  It’s of a piece with the Romney campaign’s modus operandi of incessant, outright misrepresentations of fact.  And also of a piece with state and federal Republican legislative and executive-branch officeholders’ policy of delegating to lobbying groups the actual writing of legislation, including during lame-duck periods, enacting policies never proposed and, in some instances, expressly rejected by the officeholders, pre-election.  (Think: Michigan, Dec. 2012.)</p>
<p>But there’s also a separate issue of the messenger’s’&#8211;Shear’s&#8211;curious acceptance of the false equivalence of Bush’s and Congress’s handling of the Social Security privatization issue in late 2004 and early 2005 and resolution of the tax and spending issues of the fiscal cliff.  Shear mentions that Obama’s current approval rating in this week’s polls is his highest since shortly after bin Laden was killed.  He doesn’t mention that Obama’s approval rating has been above 50% throughout the post-election period, including the period before the Newtown shooting rampage, when the cliff talks were the news story, daily.  And that Bush’s approval rating plummeted once he announced his Social Security privatization plan.  And that the juxtaposition of the drop in Bush’s approval rating and that announce was not coincidence; the polling on that issue was awful for him.</p>
<p>We all are, by now, used to the news media’s acquiescence in the Republicans’ false-equivalency game.  This Times article, by a reporter whose reporting is normally of high quality, makes me wonder whether there’s just is no limit to even the reporter-as-mindless-stenographer-for-fear-of-appearing-to-be-anti-Republican mindset at even the very highest level of the mainstream media.*</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Well … in the comments to this post, reader CasualObserver wrote:</p>

<p>
<div dir="ltr">Watch at the 5 min mark you will find that the faulty memory is all yours.</div>
<p>To which AB regular contributor Bruce Webb responded:</p>
<div dir="ltr">Well I don&#8217;t relish being the skeleton at the feast here, but Bush made his intentions on SS crystal clear when he set up his CSSS (Commission to Strengthen Social Security) in 2001 with six specific guidelines. one of whic categorically ruled out Payroll tax solutions of the sort Dale and us put forth as the &#8216;NW Plan&#8217; and another nandated that private accounts had to be part of the package.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">CSSS rolled out its recommendations right on time, unfortunately for Bush that time was right after 9/11. Absent that, which the Bush Administration was not expecting at all, we could have expected some analogue of the 2005 Social Security Tour being rolled out in 2002. The Bush Administration apparently took the intention for the deed and after fighting out the mid-terms and the 2004 presidential elections almost solely on national security somehow got the idea that yhe time was ripe to push the &#8216;Bi-Partisan&#8217; Model 2 CSSS Plan, though at first with the flimsy vover of the near identical Posen Plan. because Posen, like a full half of the CSSS was a Democrat.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Anyway by Nov 26th 2004 Bush could plausibly claim that his plans for Social Security were fully spelled out after a &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; process for the last three years and so were at least implicitly on the table during the 2004 campaign. perhaps counting on the fact that no one was paying attention. and he almost won that bet, the fond belief by Dem leaders that they shot down Model 2 is not supported by the chronology instead the SS Tour was stopped in its tracks by the blogger led &#8216;There is No Crisis&#8217; movement (in which I had an informal role but which was led by Dave Johnson and some others).</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">So no there was little to no talk of Social Security privatization on the hustings, and unless you were predisposed to be a SS geek that &#8220;I have got capital&#8221; move would indeed come out of thin air. Me I set up a new Social Security blog within 48 hours (bruceweb.blogspot.com) and started lobbing SS Report tables at figures with abandon. Because for my sins I was already seven years into this SS thing. And as such knew what Bush was about.</div>
<p>For which I am deeply grateful, Bruce, since after I read CasualObserver’s comment and did watch the video clip&#8211;which shows presidential-debate moderator Bob Schieffer asking Bush about his proposal to allow people to use part of their Social Security taxes to invest in the stock market rather than have the money go to the U.S. Treasury&#8211;I was dismayed.  How could I, who was downright obsessed with the 2004 presidential campaign and its outcome, not recall that Bush had campaigned in 2004 on his plan, announced years earlier, to partially privatize Social Security?</p>
<p>The answer, it turns out, is that Bush didn’t campaign on that plan during the 2004 campaign.  Schieffer was asking him about what had transpired before 9/11, and his commission’s recommendations, released in 2002.  To his credit, Bush, unlike a certain Republican presidential candidate in 2012, didn’t deny that he had done and said what Schieffer said he had.  Nor did he flip-flop.  He answered, straightforwardly, that this was his intention, and made a brief argument for the policy.</p>
<p>But Bush himself did not raise the issue during the campaign, and certainly did not campaign on the issue; that answer to Schieffer’s question probably is the only time he mentioned it during that campaign, unless maybe some other reporter asked him about it at some other point.  And Republicans had held control of both houses of Congress throughout Bush’s term, yet neither Bush nor the congressional Republicans had attempted to enact this into law.  That, of course, is because it was a very unpopular proposal.  </p>
<p>So CasualObserver is right, and I was wrong, that Bush made clear at some point during the campaign that he wanted to propose a plan to partially privatize Social Security.  But CasualObserver is wrong in suggesting that Bush campaigned on this.  He did not; he said, once or perhaps twice, in answer to a question, that he planned to do this.  But there was little expectation that such a proposal, if actually presented as a bill in Congress, would go very far.  And it did not go very far, not, as the current Republican congressional delegation claims, because the Senate Dems threatened a filibuster, or whatever, but because the polls were consistently showing&#8211;to Republican members of Congress as well as to Dem ones&#8211;that there was strong, broad-based opposition to it among the public.  So strong, in fact, that Bush’s 2005 attempt to have this policy enacted played a role in the unexpected change of both houses of Congress to Dem control in the 2006 election.  This, even though there weren’t enough Republican members in either house in 2005 to push this through.</p>
<p>The 2004 election was almost entirely about national security&#8211;at a time when, polls showed, about half the public still believed that Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11, and many still thought he had had weapons of mass destruction.  Virtually no one, Republican or Democrat, viewed the central issue in the campaign as anything else.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that it is delusional&#8211;or maybe just a desperate political gimmick&#8211;for the current Repub crowd to claim an equivalence, in any substantive respect at all, between the 2005 Social Security privatization issue and the fiscal-policy controversies at issue in the current situation.</p>
<p>Including, not incidentally, that the Social Security privatization issue didn’t threaten to bring down the economy in 2005.</p></div>

                                                                            <a href="./../category/steve-roth/index.html" class="post-category-41" title="Steve Roth"><div class="color-box"></div>Steve Roth</a>                                                                     </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>When I was eighteen years old, I went down to the government office in Olympia, Washington with my friend Steve (no, not that Steve) and signed as the character witness on his application for a concealed carry permit for his handgun. I was probably stoned at the time; I often was back then. (FYI, I grew up with guns in my house — stored in the gun locker up in the attic, but we took them out and shot targets now and then, cleaned them, took care of them. I went hunting several times as a kid.)</p>
<p>Steve and I are still buds, and he still carries. He even stays at my place sometimes when he’s working up here in Seattle, but he leaves the heat in his car. I guess he doesn’t feel the need to scare off the dangerous girl gangs that are forever threatening to invade my houseboat and have their way with us. (Yeah: wildest dreams.)</p>
<p>You won’t be surprised to hear that Steve and I have been going at it on Facebook since the Newtown horror (cordially, if you can believe that). I point to the numbers — less guns, less murders — and he points to countries like Mexico, which have gun control laws but still have high levels of gun homicide. I point out: those countries don’t have strong rule of law; corruption and criminal intimidation is rampant in the police, the judiciary, and the legislatures.</p>
<p>Those countries’ problem is not that they don’t (try to) control guns. It’s that they <em>can’t</em> control guns.</p>
<p>Curious as always, this led me to wonder: in countries like ours that do have a strong, well-institutionalized rule of law — countries that can control guns if they choose to — do less guns mean less gun killings?</p>
<p>Short answer, Yes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/firearms-3.png"><img alt="firearms 3" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/firearms-3.png" width="575" height="393"></a></p>
<p>CL is Chile. MK is Macedonia. FI is Finland. You know what US stands for.</p>
<p>The WJP index looked like a good measure among those I found on the web; you can choose others if you wish. I used .55 as the cutoff because it’s the line above which all European countries are included, and the resulting list seemed to consist of countries that (at least in aggregate) are fairly comparable to ours. Here’s the list:</p>
<p>Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Macedonia, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay.</p>
<p>The firearms and homicide data is from the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/statistics/data.html">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime</a>, but it’s laid out in a conveniently sortable table with a linked Google spreadsheet at this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/jul/22/gun-homicides-ownership-world-list">Guardian page</a>.</p>
<p>Steve also pointed me toward a blog that includes, among other things, a time-series analysis of gun violence and gun restrictions in the UK. I’ll simply say: if you live in the U.S. instead of the U.K., you are 43 times as likely to die of a gunshot.</p>
<p>So are your children.</p>
