                                <p>Duncan Black’s post entitled <a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/">Sully</a> is a reaction to an article by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/07/AR2006030701403.html">Dana Milbank</a> on a conference where Bruce Bartlett and Andrew Sullivan were doing some Bush bushing (also see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/conservatives-arent-fond-of-bush.html">Kash’s post</a>).  Sully and Bruce long for the days when President Reagan allegedly brought us a smaller government.  Duncan writes:<br />
<blockquote>I know the myth of the Reagan era is one of those consensus things impervious to fact but lets go to the numbers. In 1981 when Reagan took office, as a percent of GDP federal outlays were <strong>22.2%</strong> of GDP. When he left, in 1989, federal outlays were an incredibly shrunken <strong>21.2%</strong>. Revenues went from 19.6% to 18.4%, which is why we were blessed with those lovely Reagan deficits. Under George Bush II, outlays went from 18.5 to 20.1% of GDP in 2005, and revenues from 19.8 to 17.5%. An increase in outlays, to be sure, but federal expenditures are still smaller, as a percentage of GDP, than they were at the end of the Reagan era of small government.</p></blockquote>
<p>I changed the emphasis in Duncan’s post to reflect something rather odd about it.  Had Federal spending declined by 1% of GDP under President Reagan, I might understand Bruce’s argument.  The following graph was taken from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a> table 3.2 (line 1 is revenues drawn in blue and line 19 is expenditures drawn in purple – both as shares of GDP).  Federal spending as a share of GDP was 21.5% in 1981 and was 21.3% in 1989.  We did see this share decline to only 19.0% by 2000 – but that was mostly the result of the Peace Dividend.  But Bruce and Sully are right in one sense – Federal spending has risen as a share of GDP under George W. Bush.  However, the main reason for the Bush deficits is the decline in revenues and not the increase in expenditures.  </p>
<p>As far as the ratio of Federal revenues to GDP, we should be mindful of two issues.  Taxes tend to be so procyclical that the revenue to GDP ratio rises during booms and declines during recessions.  But more importantly, the use of total Federal revenues and expenditures credits to the unified surplus (deficit) those Social Security surpluses that followed the 1983 Social Security reforms.  In other words, the increase in payroll contributions partially offset the reductions in income taxes during the Reagan years.  </p>

                                <p>As you may know, Bruce Bartlett has a new book out about the Bush presidency entitled “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385518277/104-7035323-9631969?v=glance&#038;n=283155">Impostor: How George W. Bush Bankrupted America and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy</a>” which is making quite a stir.  If you don’t know who Bruce Bartlett is, let me excerpt this passage from <em>The Economist</em>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.economist.com/books/displayStory.cfm?story_id=5572467">book review</a> (which rather absurdly criticized his book for being really, really hard on Bush): <br />
<blockquote>Bruce Bartlett is a card-carrying Reaganite libertarian. He truly believes in free markets, small government and low taxes. His 1981 book “Reaganomics” was a manifesto for its era. He worked in the Reagan White House and the Treasury Department of Mr Bush&#8217;s father. Until he was sacked last autumn (for writing this book), Mr Bartlett was attached to the National Centre for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based think-tank which propounds free-market solutions for everything from health care to pension reform. His conservative credentials, in short, are beyond question.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not a conservative, and on most policy issues (though <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/bartlett-on-taxes.html">not</a> <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/03/what_bush_boom.html">all</a>) Bruce and I are on opposite sides of the fence.  Nevertheless, I find the book a refreshing helping of intellectual honesty and philosophical integrity.</p>
<p>In his book, Bartlett crystallizes an important point that is not as widely recognized as it should be: the Bush administration is indeed blindly ideological&#8230; just not to conservative ideology.  Instead, the Bush administration requires strict adherence to the doctrinal theorem “it doesn’t matter what the policy is as long as it tightens our grip on power,” and the closely related lemma of “never, ever criticize us.”  The details of what policies help them achieve these goals are irrelevant to the Bush administration.</p>
<p>At any rate, Bruce was at Cato yesterday (along with Andrew Sullivan), talking about the Bush administration.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/07/AR2006030701403.html">Dana Milbank</a> does some amusing reporting from the forum: <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;We did ask a few members of the Bush economic team to come,&#8221; explained David Boaz, [Cato&#8217;s] executive vice president, as he moderated a discussion between two prominent conservatives about President Bush. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t get that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now why would the administration pass up such an invitation?</p>
<p>&#8230;[Bartlett] began by predicting a big tax increase &#8220;to finance the inevitable growth of government that is in the pipeline that President Bush is largely responsible for.&#8221; He also said many fellow conservatives don&#8217;t know about the &#8220;quite dreadful&#8221; traits of the administration, such as the absence of &#8220;anybody who does any serious analysis&#8221; on policy issues.</p>
<p>Boaz assured the audience that he told the White House that &#8220;if there&#8217;s a rebuttal to what Bruce has said, please come and provide it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8221;If Bush were running today against Bill Clinton, I&#8217;d vote for Clinton,&#8221; Bartlett served.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to understand the people in this administration have no principles,&#8221; [Andrew] Sullivan volleyed. &#8220;Any principles that get in the way of the electoral map have to be dispensed with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boaz renewed his plea. &#8220;Any Bush economists hiding in the audience?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;Bartlett argued that Richard Nixon &#8220;is the model for everything Bush is doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sullivan said Karl Rove&#8217;s political strategy is &#8220;pathetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bartlett said that &#8220;the administration lies about budget numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not a responsible human being; he is a phenomenally reckless human being,&#8221; Sullivan proclaimed. &#8220;There is a level of recklessness involved that is beyond any ideology.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh,&#8221; Boaz interjected. &#8220;I wish we had a senior White House aide up here.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Long ago on this blog, AB made a pitch arguing that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003/10/libertarians-for-dean-18-minute-gap.html">libertarians should vote Democratic</a> rather than Republican.  For different reasons, true conservatives may be forced to the same conclusion, at least when the Republican in question is George Bush.</p>

<blockquote>Americans do not want higher taxes &#8230; Most Democrats in Congress are ignoring the two-thirds of their constituents who want tax rates to stay where they are, voting consistently to raise taxes and using the procedural mechanism of the filibuster to keep automatic rate hikes looming over American taxpayers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Never mind the fact that the Republican controlled Congress has no clue how to cut spending – so the question really is: tax me now or tax me later.  Factor continues:<br />
<blockquote>The current tax rates, on dividends and capital gains, in particular, but also regular income taxes, have been a stunning success, driving a robust economic recovery and pushing unemployment levels down to historic lows.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>All I could say when I read <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_03/008367.php">Kevin Drum</a> today on single-payer health care was &#8220;YES&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>[F]or tactical political reasons, [prominent Democratic politicians] think it&#8217;s more effective to talk about incremental solutions.  </p>
<p>I disagree. </p>
<p>&#8230;The alternative, I think, is to continue supporting improvements to the current system but to make it absolutely clear that our goal is single-payer national healthcare.  </p>
<p>&#8230;[Nothing] will happen if Democratic politicians are afraid to fight for it. We don&#8217;t have to give up incrementalism in the meantime, but we do need to make it absolutely clear what goal we&#8217;re working toward. It&#8217;s good politics, good policy, and good branding. But it&#8217;s a long fight, and the sooner we get back in the saddle and start fighting it, the better. </p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin gives some excellent arguments in favor of making single-payer health care a consistent goal (and campaign theme) of the Democratic party.  And he&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>Let me take this chance to put up links to some of the various posts that I&#8217;ve written on this issue:
<ul>
<li>A single-payer system would yield enormous savings in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/us-health-care-system-administrative.html">administrative costs</a>.</li>
<li>Moving to a single-payer system would probably <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/moving-to-single-payer-system.html">reduce overall healthcare costs</a> in the US.</li>
<li>Single-payer systems do not necessarily result in longer <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/waiting-for-health-care.html">waiting times</a>.</li>
<li>Health outcomes under a single-payer system would probably be at least as good as they <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/performance-of-us-health-care-system.html">currently are in the US</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>But most importantly, single-payer health care is the right thing to do from a moral standpoint.  And how often are political tactics and moral obligations aligned?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/119880">Brad Setser</a> objects to the following from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/05/AR2006030500943.html">Sebastian Mallaby</a>:<br />
<blockquote>There&#8217;s a powerful reason for China&#8217;s recalcitrance. The country&#8217;s technocrats were convinced years ago that revaluation made economic sense. But revaluation would cut the price of food imports, depressing earnings of Chinese farmers. Faced with simmering discontent among rural Chinese who have been left behind by China&#8217;s coastal boom, the dictatorship fears that currency revaluation could unleash furious protest.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad replies:<br />
<blockquote>Seriously, if every country set its exchange rate at levels that keep its least competitive sector competitive on global markets, its most competitive sectors will end up with an enormous advantage.    In China&#8217;s case, massive intervention to keep the exchange rate at levels that keep local food prices up (by pushing up the price of imported food) implies keeping the exchange rate at levels that will make China&#8217;s export sector (and those on Wall Street betting on China&#8217;s continued peg) very, very happy.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I take it that we still have a comparative advantage in producing agricultural goods such as rice.  Given that I have been known to use the example of apple exports to Japan to note American comparative advantage in certain portions of the agricultural sector, this statement from Brad surprised me:<br />
<blockquote>China&#8217;s apple industry is doing well and taking export market share from the US.   I just heard that China is taking over the Japanese broccoli market, too.  Apparently, using the exchange rate to protect rice farmers favors apple and broccoli exports, not just electronics exports.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad links to the <a href="http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/horticulture/Apples/Apple%20Update%20-%20November%202005.pdf">Apple Update</a>, which does a very nice job of summarizing apple production and consumption around the globe.  It turns out that China leads the world in apple consumption but also produces enough apples so as to be an exporter of this commodity.  Trade with Mexico is also mentioned:<br />
<blockquote>The United States is slowly losing market share to China. China is very proactive in opening additional markets for Chinese apples. China is actively trying to meet EU fruit standards by improving quality, food safety, apple variety, and packaging. China recently signed a trade agreement with Mexico that will open the Mexican market to Chinese apples. This will give China a competitive advantage as U.S. apples are charged a duty. On September 29, 2005, Mexico’s government announced a new, preliminary anti-dumping duty of 44.57 percent for Red and Golden Delicious varieties on all companies affiliated with Northwest Fruit Exporters  </p></blockquote>
<p>Are you shocked that Mexico is not honoring NAFTA?  Well, let’s turn to the sweetener wars for more news.One publication notes the latest from the World Trade Organization as follows:<br />
<blockquote>A WTO appellate body has found that Mexico violated WTO free trade rules by imposing a tax on soft drinks made with high fructose corn syrup that affects imported soft drinks from the United States but doesn&#8217;t affect Mexican soft drinks that are sweetened with cane sugar.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mexico’s defense of its discriminating tax was simply that the U.S. continues to impose tariffs on sugar from Mexico.  While Mexico has a point, the WTO still ruled in favor of the U.S. position.  Now as I eat my orange, I have to wonder if it is from Florida or Brazil.  Regardless, it sure is refreshing! But I bet my strawberries were grown here in California.</p>

                                <p>The “M3” measure of money is almost gone.  At least, it’s <em>probably</em> almost gone.  Its last publication is due to happen on March 23, which means that M3-related reporting requirements for financial firms end this week.  However, there remains an outside chance that Congressional interference could yet scuttle the Fed’s plan to terminate the M3 series.</p>
<p>Various observers have been unhappy with the Fed’s decision to stop publishing data on M3.  Some simply argue that more data is always better – for example, see yesterday’s post by <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2006/03/can_m3_be_saved.html">Barry Ritholtz</a>. But the bulk of the complaints are from people who subscribe to old-fashioned monetary economics (i.e. the belief that inflation is a simple function of the amount of money created by the central bank), including full-blown <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000039&#038;refer=columnist_baum&#038;sid=abJD2CVu7kHk">conspiracy theorists</a> who think that the Fed is trying to hide something. </p>
<p>But the concerns of people who are worried about the loss of a useful monetary indicator are unfounded.  The reason is simple: M3 is not a useful monetary indicator.  </p>
<p>M3 is the sum of everything in M2, such as most bank accounts and retail money market accounts, as well as a few extra things, such as assets held in institutional money funds, large time deposits, repurchase agreements, and Eurodollars.   The complicating factor for M3 is that there has been a secular trend in money management toward the sorts of assets included in M3.  Put another way, financial firms typically manage money very differently today than they did 20 years ago, and hold more of their assets in the forms included in M3.  </p>
<p>One example is institutional money funds.  If a large corporation actively manages its liquidity, each day investing excess cash in Treasury bills, for example, this wealth is not measured in M3.  But if a wave of cost-cutting and outsourcing takes place and the firm decides to let a money market mutual fund do the investing for it instead, then all of a sudden M3 has increased, even though there has been no actual change in anything real.  </p>
<p>This type of increase has happened in waves, causing sharp rises in M3 that are unrelated to anything other than the internal practices of large corporations.  As a result, movements in M3 over the past couple of decades have been dominated by these changes in cash management practices, rather than by trends in the amount of “money” in the economy.  This has rendered M3 useless as an indicator of money creation.</p>
<p>Economists who study and practice monetary policy have found that M3 has been of no empirical value for a long time.  It&#8217;s easy to see why, even to the untrained eye.  M3 has grown quite rapidly in recent years, particularly since the mid 1990s (see <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/11/much_ado_about_.html">David Altig</a> for a good picture of this).  If this reflected rapid money creation, and if one believed in the monetarist view of inflation, then one might expect that the US should have been experiencing a major bout of inflation.  Yet inflation (other than due to higher oil prices) has remained low and stable.  </p>
<p>Since M3 no longer tells us what it was designed to tell us, the Fed has decided to stop spending time and money (both their own and that of the private sector) on it.  As Chairman Bernanke put it during his <a href="http://www.knowledgeplex.org/news/146285.html">testimony before Congress</a> last month: <br />
<blockquote>BERNANKE: [W]e have done periodic analyses of the various data series that we collect to see how useful they are. And our research department&#8217;s conclusion was that M3 was not being used either by the academic community nor were we finding it very useful ourselves in our internal deliberations.</p>
<p>Now, one of our obligations is not just a question of our own costs &#8212; although, of course, we do want to be fiscally responsible on our own budget &#8212; but it&#8217;s also, I think, important for us to recognize the burden that&#8217;s placed on banks that have to report this information.</p>
<p>And so when we can reduce that burden, we would like to do so. And that was one of the considerations in the decision that was made about M3.</p></blockquote>
<p>So while the costs of maintaining M3 may be relatively small, there are real costs, and the benefits are even smaller.  Perhaps even worse, since M3 doesn’t do what it is supposed to, it can be a potentially dangerous source of misunderstanding and misinformation (as the gold bugs’ recent fascination with it attests).  As a side note, <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2005/11/whats_going_on.html">William Polley</a> reminds us that this decision has substantial precedent; the Fed discontinued M4 and M5 long ago, once they estimated that those series no longer contained any useful information.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the story isn’t quite over, as I alluded to in the opening paragraph.  To understand why, we need to return to the monetarists and conspiracy theorists who think that the Fed is trying to hide some damning evidence (of what, I’m still unclear about).</p>
<p>Their hero on Capitol Hill is Congressman <a href="http://www.house.gov/paul/bio.shtml">Ron Paul</a> (who I try not to confuse with <a href="http://www.rupaul.com/">RuPaul</a>).  Despite being trained as a physician, Ron Paul <a href="http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press2006/pr021506.htm">boasts</a> that he is “a congressional expert on monetary policy”, who took it upon himself during the last Congressional hearings to teach Chairman Bernanke that inflation is a monetary phenomenon.  In the past Ron Paul has proposed legislation in Congress to <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c107:H.R.5356:">abolish the Fed</a>, but now Paul is apparently preparing a bill that would compel the Fed to continue to publish M3.</p>
<p>Such micromanagement of the Fed by Congress strikes me as the height of absurdity, on many levels.  Obviously, having the Fed’s economists take their marching orders from a physician <em>cum</em> politician is ridiculous to begin with.  And obviously, having a country’s central bank subject to the whims of its legislature seems like a pretty good recipe for disaster in general.  </p>
<p>But silliest part of this whole story is that the concerns about the end of M3 are largely misplaced in the first place: M3 does not tell us anything useful about money creation in the economy, and so keeping it will not achieve anything but a waste of time and energy.  </p>
<p>Some other time I&#8217;ll explain why I think the other indicators of money supply are also pretty much useless.  But for now I&#8217;ll be content to simply see M3 fade into history. </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/03/AR2006030301756.html">George Will</a> has decided the former Senator John Edwards has an old paradigm of what causes poverty in America:<br />
<blockquote>Edwards has a 1930s paradigm of poverty: Poor people are like everyone else; they just lack goods and services (housing, transportation, training, etc.) that government knows how to deliver. Hence he calls for a higher minimum wage and job-creation programs. And because no Democrat with national ambitions will dare to offend teachers unions, he rejects school choice vouchers and says this: &#8220;Give working parents who are poor housing vouchers so they have a chance to move into neighborhoods with better schools.&#8221; But the 1930s paradigm of poverty was alive in 1968 when the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, created in response to urban riots, thought this would be an imaginative cure: government creation of 2 million jobs. This at a moment when the unemployment rate was 3.7 percent. The 1930s paradigm has been refuted by four decades of experience. The new paradigm is of behavior-driven poverty that results from individuals&#8217; nonmaterial deficits. It results from a scarcity of certain habits and mores &#8212; punctuality, hygiene, industriousness, deferral of gratification, etc. &#8212; that are not developed in disorganized homes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Will mentions <a href="http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.23598,filter.all/pub_detail.asp">James Q. Wilson</a> who touts Will’s very <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110002868">old view</a> as to how to avoid poverty:<br />
<blockquote>To avoid poverty, do three things: finish high school, marry before having a child, and produce the child after you are 20 years old.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is interesting that neither Mr. Will nor Mr. Wilson cite the time series data on poverty rates such as <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/histpov/hstpov6.html">this series</a> showing the percent of the population below 125% of the official poverty level.  Four decades ago, this rate was 21.3% and it declined to only 15.8% by 1978.  It is true that the next 15 years saw this rate rise to 20%, which was partly the result of 3 recessions and the type of neglect to solving poverty that Mr. Will advocates we return to.  Of course, the Clinton years saw more progress at reducing poverty so that this rate dropped to 15.6% before George W. Bush took office.  Then again – this rate has increased to 17.1%.  I wonder why.</p>

                                <p>I wanted to follow-up on a couple of aspects as to my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/bush-v-cheney-on-consumption-and.html">post</a> noting Dick Cheney hoping people would <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CHENEY_SAVINGS?SITE=7219&#038;SECTION=HOME&#038;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&#038;CTIME=2006-03-02-15-53-52">save more</a>.  </p>
<p>First of all – one of our readers is now saying Bush and his allies never said that the Administration wanted to give people their money back so they could consume more.  Yes – Bush said many times that he wanted to give us our money back EVEN THOUGH his government kept on spending it.  Then again – most folks see rising debt as deferred tax liabilities so this White House has not kept its promises to give us our money back.  But check out this <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0110/04/cf.00.html">Crossfire</a> transcript from October 4, 2001:<br />
<blockquote>WATTS: But Bill, I did hear you and Charlie saying that that tax relief package was too big. That &#8212; I have to disagree with that, simply because if 68 percent of the economy is driven by consumer spending, it&#8217;s healthy and it&#8217;s good for the economy to give people their money back to buy appliances or to buy food, to buy clothes, to help with house payments. That&#8217;s a good thing, and I think, you know, what we see ourselves drifting into post-September 11th &#8212; boy, let me tell you, that was very prophetic that we passed the tax package when we did. That&#8217;s good for the American people.<br />RANGEL: Suppose I agreed with you and said that it&#8217;s consumer confidence that we&#8217;re after, and we have to get that money out there. Why then would the Secretary of Treasury say that we ought to accelerate the tax cut with the middle income and why would Mr. Armey and Mr. Thomas talk about capital gains tax cuts? Talk about tax cuts for accelerated depreciation and expensing variety of things for the corporations. They&#8217;re not really investing, because they can&#8217;t get rid of the goods they have. So half of the stimulus package is a business package that the Republicans had before we went to war.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rangel is a Democrat who was hoping for a more effective aggregate demand stimulus back in October 2001, while Watts was a Republican Congressman echoing the White House line.  Back that was a while back.  So why is Dick Cheney still supporting tax cuts – this time for the long-run?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The American dream begins with saving money and that should begin on the very first day of work,&#8221; Cheney told a conference here exploring how to encourage people to boost savings and be better prepared for retirement. Too often, workers are living paycheck to paycheck and are not saving sufficiently, Cheney said. Last year, Americans&#8217; personal savings rate dropped to its lowest point since the Great Depression. The dismal state of savings comes as a big wave of baby boomers will soon start retiring. That wave of retirees will eventually put massive strains on government resources as people draw on Social Security and Medicare benefits, Cheney said. Fewer workers, meanwhile, can be counted on to help bankroll the retirement program. &#8220;With an aging population, and a steadily falling ratio of workers to retirees, the system is on a course to eventual bankruptcy,&#8221; the vice president said … &#8220;There will always be a wagon load of excuses for ignoring the problem of entitlements,&#8221; Cheney said. &#8220;But Americans have a right to expect more out of the nation&#8217;s leaders, especially when it comes to Social Security and other defining national promises.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now making this speech takes a lot of gall coming from a White House that massively increased expected future entitlements with its overly expensive prescription drug benefit and even more massively reduced expected future taxes with its irresponsible tax deferrals, which they’d like to turn into permanent tax cuts.  But as far as I can tell – the only way that Dick Cheney intends to reduce the fiscal fiasco of his own making is to eliminate your future Social Security retirement benefits even as the government still collects payroll taxes.  Of course, this would make those who main form of savings is their payroll contributions to the Social Security program Cheney hopes to destroy worse off – not better off.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=71000001&#038;refer=us&#038;sid=aAZRH6MUBTlE">Robert Rubin</a> is correct:<br />
<blockquote>Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin urged fellow Democrats to reject President George W. Bush&#8217;s plan for a bipartisan commission to examine solutions to the mounting costs of Social Security and health care. Rubin, who served in President Bill Clinton&#8217;s administration, said Democratic leaders in Congress should instead insist Bush join them in a &#8220;fiscal commission&#8221; to discuss all options for cutting the budget deficit, including rolling back Bush&#8217;s tax cuts. </p></blockquote>

<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/10-yr-yield1.jpg"><br />Note: 10-year interest rate expressed in tenths of a percentage point, so &#8220;47&#8221; indicates 4.7%, etc.</p>
<p>Interest rates were higher for a few weeks during May and June of 2004, but other than that one must go back to 2002 to find long-term rates as high as they are today.</p>

<blockquote>Meet the typical American family.</p>
<p>It has about $3,800 in the bank. No one has a retirement account, and the neighbors who do only have about $35,000 in theirs. Mutual funds? Stocks? Bonds? Nope. The house is worth $160,000, but the family owes $95,000 on it to the bank. The breadwinners make more than $43,000 a year but can&#8217;t manage to pay off a $2,200 credit card balance.</p>
<p>That is the portrait of the median American household as painted by the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s Survey of Consumer Finances. </p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, overall wealth in the US seems to have risen a lot in recent years.  But as PGL sagely reminds us from time to time, in real per capita terms much or all of that increase in illusory.  Very commonly, household debts have risen as fast or faster than their assets.  </p>
<p>By consuming instead of saving, the typical household has arrived at the situation described above: a dearth of readily accessible savings; the vast proportion of their wealth allocated to their house; and a huge resulting vulnerability to changes in the economy, interest rates, and personal fortunes.  In that sense (and not coincidentally), the situation of the typical household could be taken as a pretty good metaphor for the US as a whole.</p>
