<blockquote><p>The hearing began with a sudden and sharp partisan dispute when Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter ruled that Gonzales did not have to be sworn in to testify. After Democrats strongly objected and demanded a roll-call vote, Republicans prevailed and the attorney general did not testify under oath.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before one asks why not, let’s see what he has been reported to have said to the Senate committee:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The terrorist surveillance program is necessary, it is lawful and it respects the civil liberties we all cherish,&#8221; Gonzales said &#8230; Gonzales told the committee that the program is limited to communication between someone in the U.S. and someone in a foreign nation; triggered when a NSA professional beliefs one of the parties is tied to al Qaeda &#8230; Gonzales responded that he was asked whether the president could authorize surveillance that violated law. &#8220;That has not occurred&#8221;, he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>My question sort of answers itself – it would not be prudent for the Attorney General to have lied under oath, would it?</p>

<p>Menzie writes:<br />
<blockquote>By December 2004, payroll employment was -76,000 less than in January 2001. Both the payroll employment series, and the household survey based employment series adjusted to conform to the establishment survey coverage, are plotted in the figure below … Not only has employment growth been unnaturally low in this recovery, it has been &#8211; and remains &#8211; low relative to even the post-1991 recovery, which was itself marked by slow job creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Put another way – payroll employment as of January 2005 was the same as it was as of January 2001, that is, zero growth during Bush’s first term.  While it is true that we have had better decent growth over the past year, the cumulative growth during the first five years of this century has been very low for such a time span.</p>

                                <p>In the spirit of Brad DeLong&#8217;s <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/teaching_spring_2006/">course on economics reporting</a>, I noticed this morning that Joel Havemann of the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-budget6feb06,0,4647679.story?coll=la-home-nation">LA Times</a> does a reasonably good job providing some context against which to measure the Bush administration&#8217;s budget rhetoric:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Bush Budget Plan Strikes Home, Not Deficit</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Bush today will propose a $2.7-trillion budget that would take another slice out of domestic spending next year — but still leave a huge $355-billion deficit.</p>
<p>In Bush&#8217;s budget for fiscal year 2007, which begins Oct. 1, the departments of Defense and Homeland Security would continue to grow at a rate greater than inflation.</p>
<p>But most other federal departments, from Agriculture to Veterans Affairs, will be asked to get along next year with less money, and with no allowance for inflation or population growth.</p>
<p>Altogether, Bush&#8217;s budget would save $14.5 billion next year by eliminating or sharply curtailing 141 federal programs — fulfilling his vow in last week&#8217;s State of the Union address to reduce the costs of what he called &#8220;non-security discretionary spending.&#8221;</p>
<p>Broken down, those range from a relatively small nick in Medicare&#8217;s enormous growth to the virtual elimination of a small program that distributes food to the elderly.</p></blockquote>
<p>The things that Havemann&#8217;s article could have done better are: 1) providing a bit more context to illustrate that the $14.5 billion cut from some discretionary programs, while a lot of money to the programs being cut, is peanuts compared to the huge numbers in the defense budget, entitlements, and the deficit; and 2) pointing out that while the Bush budget does show a halving of the deficit as a percent of GDP by 2009 (though not in dollar terms), the administration&#8217;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/pdf/overview-06.pdf">budget document</a> showing this fall is suspiciously vague about the assumptions it incorporates regarding spending in Iraq and Afghanistan, future tax cuts, and AMT relief.  All of these major factors affecting the budget are frequently excluded from Bush administration budget forecasts whenever they are inconvenient to their rhetorical goals.</p>
<p>Those quibbles aside, this is a pretty good piece of reporting, and overall the LA Times continues to generally provide better reporting on the budget and economic issues than you will see from most major news outlets.</p>

<blockquote>Including revisions, January employment is a huge 317,000 above the initial December level.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/02/latest_employme_1.html">James Hamilton</a> reads this sentence and writes:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;m not quite sure where Larry is getting this 317,000 figure, but I am inclined not to make too much of the data revisions. As the table on the right reveals, the revised figures released yesterday show 140,000 new jobs in December, rather than the 108,000 December job growth figure that was reported on January 6.</p></blockquote>
<p>But let’s go to page 6 of the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Employment Situation Summary</a> that discusses revisions to establishment survey data:</p>
<blockquote><p>In accordance with annual practice, the establishment survey data have been revised to reflect comprehensive universe counts of payroll jobs, or benchmarks. These counts are derived principally from unemployment insurance tax records for March 2005.  As a result of the benchmark process, all not seasonally adjusted data series were subject to revision from April 2004 forward, the time period since the last benchmark was established.  In addition, with this release, the seasonally adjusted establishment survey data from January 2001 forward were subject to revision due to the introduction of updated seasonal adjustment factors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Had these revisions increased reported employment by something on the order of 93,000, then perhaps we might understand how Mr. Kudlow came up with his 317,000 figure.  Now any reasonable person would say such playing games with numbers is rubbish, but note Kudlow loves to report the change in the reported household survey figures – never acknowledging the footnotes, which state “data affected by changes in population controls in January 2000, January 2003, January 2004, January 2005, and January 2006”.  To illustrate how dishonest Kudlow et al. are being, let’s consider the following chart of the reported household survey figure from October 2002 to September 2003 – a period in which the employment to population ratio declined from 62.7% to 62%.  Yet, the reported employment number appears to be higher on September 2003 than it was on October 2002 because of the jump in reported employment from December 2002 to January 2003.  This jump occurred not because the employment to population ratio jumped.  Rather it is related to the “changes in population controls in January 2003”.  </p>

<p>Kudlow got the sign wrong per the recent revision in the payroll survey.  Table C shows the December figure “as previously published” to be 134,468,000 as compared to the revised figure of 134,371,000.  Now if some pessimist wished to be as dishonest as Kudlow has been in the past, he could not that the January 2006 figure of 134,564,000 is only 96,000 greater than the 134.468,000 December figure “as previously published”.  But let’s not go down this dishonest path – January did see an increase in employment that was indeed almost 200,000, which was neither as explosive as Kudlow had claimed nor as small as his inappropriate reporting technique (done right) would have implied.  The following graph shows reported employment from July 2005 to December 2005 “as previously published” as well as the current reporting from July 2005 to January 2006.</p>

<p>No wonder Dr. Hamilton was confused by Kudlow’s Kalculation – as Kudlow once again fails to tell his readers what he has done and this time fails to double check his math.</p>

                                <p>So asks <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200602031604.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> who writes:<br />
<blockquote>Economic pessimists have had a field day ever since GDP was reported a week ago at only 1.1 percent for the fourth quarter. But the latest jobs report released on Friday blew them out of the water. Including revisions, January employment is a huge 317,000 above the initial December level. In fact, over the past three months, non-farm payrolls have increased an average 229,000 per month. That’s explosive … As soon as the breakout employment news was released, Salesman-in-Chief George W. Bush should have been in the Rose Garden giving it air time. He should have declared that jobs have continued to grow big time while the unemployment rate has fallen &#8211; all the way down to 4.7 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair to Mr. Kudlow, I was hoping someone would bring up as I was eager to bring up an old point about the labor force participation rate and I see that <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2006/02/payroll_employm.html">William Polley</a> has already weighed in.  The point starts with the identity that the unemployment rate is simply one minus (the employment-population ratio/the labor force participation rate).  </p>
<p>Let’s go back to December 2000 (just before George Bush took office) and remember that the employment-population ratio was 64.4%, while the labor force participation rate was 67.0% &#8211; which translated into a 3.9% unemployment rate.  Economic growth, however, was dreadfully slow from early 2001 to September 2003, which translated into an employment-population ratio of only 62.1%.  The unemployment rate, however, only rose to 6.2% as the labor force participation rate had declined to 66.1%.  From September 2003 to January 2006, the recovery in the labor market has not been explosive but has been sufficient to let the employment-population ratio inch back up to 62.9%.  Alas, the labor force participation rate is 66.0%, which is lower than where it was as of September 2003.  Leave to Mr. Kudlow to cheer about falling unemployment as a result of fewer people being officially counted in the labor force.</p>
<p>Even as Dr. Polley notes that whether it is reasonable to expect the labor force participation rate to rise, let’s consider what the implications of a 62.9% employment-population ratio would be if the labor force participation rate were currently at 67%.  Wow – the unemployment rate would be 6.1%.  Even if we split the difference and assumed a 66.5% labor force participation rate with the present employment-population ratio, we’d be talking about a 5.4% unemployment rate.</p>
<p>But beyond these simple realities, there may be another reason President Bush does not wish to join Kudlow’s cheerleading.  I bet that President Bush – like Mr. Kudlow – is hoping for another pander to the voters style free lunch tax cut – and if one claimed we were at full employment, the logic behind advocating even more fiscal stimulus would simply be too stupid for even this White House.  But not to NRO Financial.</p>

                                <p>Apparently, Donald Marron testified to the Senate Budget Committee yesterday &#8211; and if the account I’m being told is true, I have a lot more respect for Senator Judd Gregg (Republican-New Hampshire) than I do for Mr. Marron.  From a Tax Analyst account of the testimony:<br />
<blockquote>Marron told the committee that the February 1 passage of a budget reconciliation bill in the House would chip about $5 billion from this year’s estimated $337 billion federal budget deficit. Other than that, Marron’s testimony was consistent with the themes he has echoed since the January 26 release of the latest CBO outlook: Over the next 10 years the deficit is projected to improve, the economy should remain strong, and challenges from entitlement programs loom. Marron said those themes and projections assume that mandatory spending programs will continue, that discretionary spending will grow at the rate of inflation, and that tax law will stay as is.  In other words, said Budget Committee Chair Judd Gregg, R-N.H., the CBO’s baseline “takes into account things that probably aren’t going to happen.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Kent Conrad (Democrat-North Dakota) also got in an important objection to Mr. Marron’s testimony:<br />
<blockquote>Conrad dismissed the argument that the president’s tax cuts on capital gains and dividends would generate enough economic growth to offset the revenue loss they cause.  Marron agreed: “Pro-growth tax cuts &#8211; reducing marginal rates, things that are focused on savings and investment &#8211; do help the economy grow, and therefore you get back something from that economic behavior that a purely static estimate wouldn’t account for. But the scenarios being considered do not come close to actually paying for themselves.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What does President Bush continue to say?  Oh yea, we need to give people their money back so they can CONSUME more.  Which means national savings decline (yes, I’m assuming that this Congress will continue to only pretend to cut spending).  So how does the acting director of the CBO get away with claiming that savings and investment will increase?</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/02/does_the_death_.html">Tyler Cowen</a>, <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w11982">John J. Donohue and Justin Wolfers</a> questions the empirical evidence purporting to show that capital punishment deters murder:<br />
<blockquote>Does the death penalty save lives? A surge of recent interest in this question has yielded a series of papers purporting to show robust and precise estimates of a substantial deterrent effect of capital punishment. We assess the various approaches that have been used in this literature, testing the robustness of these inferences. Specifically, we start by assessing the time series evidence, comparing the history of executions and homicides in the United States and Canada, and within the United States, between executing and non-executing states. We analyze the effects of the judicial experiments provided by the Furman and Gregg decisions and assess the relationship between execution and homicide rates in state panel data since 1934. We then revisit the existing instrumental variables approaches and assess two recent state-specific execution morartoria. In each case we find that previous inferences of large deterrent effects based upon specific examples, functional forms, control variables, comparison groups, or IV strategies are extremely fragile and even small changes in the specifications yield dramatically different results. The fundamental difficulty is that the death penalty &#8212; at least as it has been implemented in the United States &#8212; is applied so rarely that the number of homicides that it can plausibly have caused or deterred cannot be reliably disentangled from the large year-to-year changes in the homicide rate caused by other factors. As such, short samples and particular specifications may yield large but spurious correlations. We conclude that existing estimates appear to reflect a small and unrepresentative sample of the estimates that arise from alternative approaches. Sampling from the broader universe of plausible approaches suggests not just &#8220;reasonable doubt&#8221; about whether there is any deterrent effect of the death penalty, but profound uncertainty &#8211; even about its sign.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their abstract reminds me of an argument in Edward Leamer’s  <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8282(198303)73%3A1%3C31%3ALTTCOO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-R"> Let&#8217;s Take the Con Out of Econometrics</a>.  For more discussion on whether capital punishment deters murder, see the testimony of <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/FaganTestimony.pdf">Jeffrey Fagan</a>.</p>
<p>Confession – I’m opposed to capital punishment in part because I’ve yet to be convinced that the evidence shows any deterrent value.</p>

                                <p>This morning the BLS released its estimate of net new job creation in Janaury.  Including upward revisions in the new job estimates for the previous few months, it was <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">a pretty good report</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 193,000 in January, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Job gains occurred in several industries, including construction, mining, food services and drinking places, health care, and financial activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, construction employment still seems to be growing robustly, despite some concerns that the real estate market is cooling off; 46,000 of the new jobs created last month were in construction.</p>
<p>Taking a look at the industry shares of employment gains over the past year illustrates that construction has regularly accounted for nearly one out of five new jobs in the US economy.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/sector_jobs3.jpg"></p>
<p>In percentage terms the growth rate of jobs in the construction sector was higher than for [almost] any other industry in 2005, as the following table shows (job growth in thousands, wage in $/hour).</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/sector_jobs4.jpg"></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, all of this confirms what we already knew: the US economy is steadily shifting away from producing tradeable goods, toward producing non-tradeable goods.  And that underlies most of the concern many people have about how painful an adjustment in the US&#8217;s current account deficit might someday be.</p>

                                <p>Those of us who applauded the Bush41 and Clinton Administrations for moving us closer to free trade might have been tempted to cheer the following passages from the latest State of the Union addressed delivered by Bush43:<br />
<blockquote>We will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy &#8211; or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity. In a complex and challenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting &#8211; yet it ends in danger and decline. The only way to protect our people . . . the only way to secure the peace . . . the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership &#8211; so the United States of America will continue to lead … The American economy is pre-eminent &#8211; but we cannot afford to be complacent. In a dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors like China and India. This creates uncertainty, which makes it easier to feed people&#8217;s fears. And so we are seeing some old temptations return. Protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy. Others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy, centralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes. We hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy &#8211; even though this economy could not function without them. All these are forms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction &#8212; toward a stagnant and second-rate economy … Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all that Americans make and grow. One out of every five factory jobs in America is related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy American. With open markets and a level playing field, no one can out-produce or out-compete the American worker. </p></blockquote>
<p>As I heard these remarks, two thoughts emerged.  First – this Administration has had a dismal record on free trade.  Secondly – let’s focus on “this creates uncertainty”.  Indeed, there are those who do suffer economic losses from opening our markets to global competition.  Since the President is recognizing the reality of economic uncertainty, one has to wonder why he is pushing his ownership society, which is essentially efforts to reduce the means to mitigate uncertainty – such as health and retirement insurance.  </p>
<p>Later, we heard the following:<br />
<blockquote>Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. Here we have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world … Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the Middle East by 2025. By applying the talent and technology of America, this country can dramatically improve our environment . . . move beyond a petroleum- based economy . . . and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/02/why_oh_why_are_.html">Brad DeLong</a> points us to the White House having to backpedal on this promise, while <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_02/008136.php">Kevin Drum</a> notes that the White House continues to flip-flop on this issue. Kevin’s <em>Political Animal</em> colleague, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_02/008134.php">Christina Larson</a> demonstrates that the only way the government can achieve Bush’s promise is trade protection.  So why do conservatives argue that George W. Bush is for free trade?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>It is being reported that the Bush administration is preparing to request $70bn in additional funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (<a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=politicsNews&#038;storyID=2006-02-02T180043Z_01_WAT004783_RTRUKOC_0_US-BUSH-IRAQ-FUNDS.xml">Reuters</a>) &#8211; President George W. Bush will ask Congress for another $70 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, congressional sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The sources said that money, which would come on top of about $330 billion for the wars so far, would be for this fiscal year. The White House likely will seek another $50 billion in emergency money in the fiscal 2007 defense spending bill for the wars, the sources said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as a reminder, let&#8217;s think back to <a href="http://www.iraqfoundation.org/news/2003/ajan/2_whitehouse.html">what the White House said</a> during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq:<br />
<blockquote>The administration&#8217;s top budget official estimated today that the cost of a war with Iraq could be in the range of $50 billion to $60 billion, a figure that is well below earlier estimates from White House officials&#8230; Mr. Daniels would not provide specific costs for either a long or a short military campaign against Saddam Hussein. But he said that the administration was budgeting for both, and that earlier estimates of $100 billion to $200 billion in Iraq war costs by Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush&#8217;s former chief economic adviser, were too high.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, one could make plenty of other fun <a href="http://costofwar.com/">juxtapositions</a> with this large and growing bill for Iraq, including <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/AccountTempFiles/cf/%7BE9245FE4-9A2B-43C7-A521-5D6FF2E06E03%7D/PRIRAQCLAIMFACT1029.HTM#4">more juxtapositions</a> between reality and what the Bush administration expected before the war.</p>
<p>My favorite juxtaposition today, however, is simply putting this post next to my earlier post about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/02/mean-spiritied.html">spending cuts</a>.</p>
