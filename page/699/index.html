                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/4160/1/529">OMB Watch</a> suggests looking at projections first for talk on fiscal responsibility. Hence instead of talking idealogy first, go for the numbers. It is not BDS to use this years budget, in that the projections have been manipulated for decades. We are just better at manipulation after decades of experience, and the supplementals simply throw out the bathwater, baby, and soap so far in making sense of the budget.</p>
<blockquote><p>So what were the economic experts saying when OMB were making their assumptions for the FY 2009 budget request? In testimony before Congress on Dec. 5th, <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/88xx/doc8876/12-5-Economic.htm" target="_blank">CBO Director Peter Orszag told Congress</a> that the Blue Chip forecast was for 2.4 percent GDP growth in 2008 and that the Federal Reserve Board were predicting growth of 1.8 to 2.5 percent. Applying the administration&#8217;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/apers.html" target="_blank">economic sensitivity data</a> (p177) &#8211; a 1 percentage point reduction in GDP growth results in a $13.8 billion drop in revenue and a $2.6 billion increase in spending &#8211; to the Fed&#8217;s high-end 2.5 percent estimate, the projected deficit would be $413.3 billion in 2008 &#8211; a tie for largest nominal deficit.</p>
<p>A budget that predicts a record-high deficit would be terribly inconvenient for a president who wishes to be remembered as &#8220;fiscally-responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>FY 2008 Deficits Under Various Economic Assumptions<br />Projecting Organization<br />GDP Growth Rate (percent)<br />Projected FY 2008 Deficit (billions of dollars)<br />Noted in President&#8217;s Budget<br />OMB         2.7               410<br />CBO          1.7                426<br />Blue Chip 2.2                419<br />Assumptions Cited by Orszag in December Testimony<br />Blue Chip  2.                 415<br />Fed (low)  1.8              426<br />Fed, high    2.5            413</p></blockquote>
<p>So the first order of the day is to think citizen ground rules.</p>
<p>1. What is a reasonable number for growth expectations?<br />2. Given current ways of dealing with taxes, what is expected revenue. This is federal revenue. State and local revenue is a whole lot messier in many places.<br />3. What contributes to the deficit?<br />4. What are the difficulties in getting beyond an idealogical argument between slightly left and slighty right? (Social Security being the first for revenue, since this revenue has balooned so dramaticly, and the second being?)</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;ve noticed (and I&#8217;m not the only one) that as of late, some of the exchanges in comments have gotten more vicious.  I don&#8217;t mean disagreement &#8211; I mean flat out name-calling.  Now I enjoy mocking stupidity as much as the next guy, and if I rummage around I can find instances where I&#8217;ve crossed the line myself, but at some point it is off-putting to a lot of people.</p>
<p>I am not talking about disagreement&#8230;  regular readers know we have a policy of putting up posts even by people with whom we disagree.  But calling people names, and doing so regularly, doesn&#8217;t move anything forward and probably doesn&#8217;t benefit anyone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also noticed that the viciousness ebbs and flows depending on the ebb and flow of the personality of some of our commentators.  For instance, once PGL&#8217;s bestest troll in the world stopped coming by regularly, the degree vitriol dropped quite a bit for a while.  Now, its an upswing again.</p>
<p>So we have to consider our options&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  Ignore it hope one of the ebbs comes soon.<br />2.  Ask people politely to keep the vitriol to a minimum.<br />3.  Start moderating.<br />4.  Ban people.<br />5.  Use ridicule.</p>
<p>Now, none of us have the time to start moderating the comments.  Its just not possible.  But I don&#8217;t think any of the other options are incompatible with each other.  So&#8230; let&#8217;s try this:</p>
<p>Please, keep the vitriol to a minimum.  Don&#8217;t call other people idiots, or any synonym for that word.  If you want to demonstrate someone is an idiot, feel free.  Break out with the facts and show it.  It will be a lot more convincing to everyone else than whatever assertions you make.  But remember the key word:  facts.  Neither your opinion, nor mine, is a fact, no matter how strongly held and how often you repeat it.  There aren&#8217;t always facts available, and sometimes the facts are open to interpretation, but when you have to go with something other than a fact, be cognizant that it is not, no matter how much believe it, a fact.  </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t make us have to figure out how to ban you.  Its a waste of our time, and yours.</p>

I believe this is the first edition.</p>
<p>It is coordinated between Treasury, OMB, and the Comptroller General. It is pdf.  It reads like the last legacy of David Walker as he heads out to private think tank and Alan Greenspan&#8217;s new booklet on his wisdom.  But that is my snark.  It is supposed to explain what is up to the average person.</p>

                                <p>In comments to his earlier post on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/howard-covitz-mccain-iraq-and-south.html">comparison between Chile and South Korea</a>, Howard Covitz writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had read the Wikipedia entries before writing my e-mail, and basically was hoping to get either confirmation or denial about the comparison to Chile&#8230;economic success at the cost of liberty (and I figured Cactus might have some cultural insight from a South American standpoint).</p></blockquote>
<p>My best answer to this may not be very good, but I&#8217;ll give it a stab.  I&#8217;m not sure my perspective is South American; I grew up in South America, though I was born in the US (American mother, Argentine father).  One additional thing that may color my perspective &#8211; Chile was run as an experiment by the Chicago Boys and in grad school I would one day have the privilege of studying under the godfather of the Chicago boys, Arnold Harberger.</p>
<p>So here are my semi-random thoughts:</p>
<p>1.  Chile has, in many ways, been the big success story over the past few decades in South America in terms of economic growth.</p>
<p>2.  In many people&#8217;s minds, the US is very closely associated with Pinochet taking power in Chile.  Just about anybody who doesn&#8217;t work for the Wall Street Journal seems aware of the fact that the CIA provided encouragement and intelligence to those plotting the overthrow of Chile&#8217;s democratically elected government in 1973.  </p>
<p>3.  But the US involvement was essentially the same in other, um, transitions from democratically elected governments to military rule.  LBJ despised João (&#8220;Jango&#8221; &#8211; Brazilians do come up with some cool nicknames!) Goulart and I understand that the relationship between the American and Brazilian administrations in 1964 were no different than the relationships between the American and Venezuelan administrations today.  But clearly, the US took a few steps then that they didn&#8217;t now &#8211; here are excerpts from a <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/johnsonlb/xxxi/36291.htm">recently declassified telegram the American military attache to Brazil sent to his superiors in Washington</a> (notice that I&#8217;m linking to the State Department&#8217;s website &#8211; this is not exactly The Nation that I&#8217;m quoting here) less than a week before the coup in Brazil:</p>
<blockquote><p>He had just come from meeting of resistance movement to Goulart and said it had been decided to take action this week on a signal to be issued later. Response to Castello Branco document from Second Army Commander General Kruel fully satisfactory. Kruel stated that he agreed one hundred percent with document and considered himself released from any obligation to Goulart by reasons of latter’s recent actions. Kruel added that if relieved as Second Army Commander he would not turn over command. Cintra said that when Castello Branco is relieved as Chief of Staff early this week he will immediately issue denunciation to nation. Helicopter has been laid on to move Castello Branco, Gen Cordeiro de Farias and Marshal Dutra out of Rio and on to Sao Paulo when movement is imminent. Cintra indicated that he and BGEN Syseno Garmento will remain in Rio de Janeiro. BGEN Moniz de Aragao will operate in Rio Vila Militar. Movement in Vila Militar will begin from bottom up and plans have been made to neutralize key units believed to be favorable to Goulart and leftists. Cintra said that central command of movement would initially be in Sao Paulo. Arrangements have been made with navy and air force for joint action. BGEN Souto Malan proceeding this morning to Porto Alegre with full instructions for Maj Gen Adalberto Pereira dos Santos there in command of Sixth Inf Div and next senior officer to Third Army Commander. Cintra confident of Minas Gerais Garrison and said Governor Magalhaes Pinto of that state eager for move. Total movement may be triggered by meeting of democratic governors in Porto Alegre on Wednesday. Day not yet decided for initiation of movement. Cintra seemed confident of success.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Major Moraes Rego leaves in morning for Recife carrying instructions for Fourth Army Commander Justino Alves Bastos. Comment: While this may be only talk ARMA has never seen Cintra as assured and positive. ARMA expects to be aware beforehand of go signal and will report in consequence. If opposition intends to do something this is time. Cintra stated flatly move would occur during coming week barring overriding reason for postponement as further waiting would only help Goulart.</p></blockquote>
<p>I will repeat&#8230; this is on the State Department&#8217;s website.  That this happened is  not some leftist propaganda.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to know these names or recognize the geographic references to figure out that the generals planning to overthrow the civilian government were keeping the US fully informed.  But the US support was more than tacit&#8230;  see the line about &#8220;plans have been made to neutralize key units believed to be favorable to Goulart and leftists&#8221;?  The coup plotters were particularly worried about the First Army, based in Rio &#8211; its General did not sign on for the coup.   Now&#8230; it just so happens my father was an exchange student in Rio at the time.  He told me American warships showed up and started patrolling up and down just off the coast&#8230; sending a clear message not only to General Âncora, the commander of the First Army, but to the local population and the Brazilian government as well.  Everyone knew the coup was coming and that the Americans were in on it.</p>
<p>4.  The US didn&#8217;t impose the Chicago Boys on Chile.  Pinochet did.  And elsewhere, each country&#8217;s military junta cooked up its own silly economic policy.  The &#8220;infant industry&#8221;  concept  (which, incidentally, was copied from Asian countries like Japan, Taiwan and South Korea) was especially popular.  For instance, you couldn&#8217;t import electronic equipment into Brazil or Argentina without paying very steep import duties. </p>
<p>5.  As per item 4, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to say the US tolerated lack of liberty in exchange for economic success unless in Chile you also say the US tolerated lack of liberty in exchange for economic stupidity elsewhere in Latin America.  Basically, the US didn&#8217;t care about the economic policies being tried provided that folks running the show called themselves anti-communist. </p>
<p>6.  When the military takes over a country, they like to run it.  That includes the economy.  All of these countries &#8211; Chile included &#8211; nationalized key sectors of the economy (or if they had already been nationalized, kept them that way).  Pinochet decided that his predecessor had nationalized too many industries, so he sold off some of them.  But he wasn&#8217;t about to relinquish control of the key sectors.  Chile produces more than a third of the world&#8217;s copper.  As I recall, Pinochet kept that under government control.</p>
<p>7.  Another note on copper&#8230; Chile&#8217;s population is actually pretty small&#8230; even today we&#8217;re talking about 16 or 17 million.  One third of the world&#8217;s copper production divides up nicely in population that small.  This is not a model that could be emulated by a country that doesn&#8217;t have quite the same ratio of natural resources to population any more than Norway or Saudi Arabia can be emulated.  </p>
<p>8.  If you&#8217;re interested in free markets in South America, perhaps General Stroessner in Paraguay ran a freer market than General Pinochet did in Chile, and Paraguay doesn&#8217;t have Chile&#8217;s copper, so if any market could be emulated, Stroessner&#8217;s Paraguay is a better example than Pinochet&#8217;s Chile.  Sure, there was the same government meddling, and Stroessner is the same sort of villain.  At one time, the second largest  in Paraguay was &#8220;Puerto Stroessner&#8221; &#8211; now that its verminous namesake is gone, the city has reverted to its old name, Ciudad del Este.  Puerto Stroessner is on the border with Brazil and Argentina.  Remember the infant industry argument and how you couldn&#8217;t import electronic goods into Brazil or Argentina?  Well&#8230;  at the time you could buy electronic equipment on the Paraguayan side of the border&#8230; and for an extra fee (there were two prices listed for all electronic goods on sale in Puerto Stroessner) those goods would appear at your hotel doorstep on the Argentine or Brazilian side of the border the next morning.  And trade went the other way too&#8230;  I remember hearing a statistic that a third of the cars stolen in South America that are not recovered end up in Paraguay, and my understanding is that they&#8217;re still big in that industry. </p>
<p>My point&#8230; the closest thing to a free market I saw in South America at the time, and it wasn&#8217;t very close at all, looked an awful lot like Tijuana.</p>

<p>Paul, however, would have preferred more spending on infrastructure and less on the instruments of war.  Paul then reminds us of something <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch10.htm">Lord Keynes</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pyramid-building, earthquakes, even wars may serve to increase wealth, if the education of our statesmen on the principles of the classical economics stands in the way of anything better.  It is curious how common sense, wriggling for an escape from absurd conclusions, has been apt to reach a preference for wholly “wasteful” forms of loan expenditure rather than for partly wasteful forms, which, because they are not wholly wasteful, tend to be judged on strict “business” principles. For example, unemployment relief financed by loans is more readily accepted than the financing of improvements at a charge below the current rate of interest; whilst the form of digging holes in the ground known as gold-mining, which not only adds nothing whatever to the real wealth of the world but involves the disutility of labour, is the most acceptable of all solutions.  If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coalmines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again (the right to do so being obtained, of course, by tendering for leases of the note-bearing territory), there need be no more unemployment and, with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community, and its capital wealth also, would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is. It would, indeed, be more sensible to build houses and the like; but if there are political and practical difficulties in the way of this, the above would be better than nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Political difficulties in achieving a more sensible use of government expenditure!  How did Keynes back in 1936 have the foresight to predict the modern Republican Party?!</p>

                                <p>Reader Howard Covitz sends me this e-mail:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given McCain&#8217;s comparison of Iraq to Korea, I think it would be prudent for voters to familiarize themselves with the 20th century history of that country.  I only recently realized how shallow my own conception of Korean history was, and can only imagine that most Americans are, too.  I would expect that most Americans nowadays consider South Korea a success story, given the mainstream image we generally get of it, and the American focus on economic/material success at the cost of democratic/political success.  The image is all the more rosy when contrasted to the mainstream conception of North Korea as an economic wasteland let by a caricatured madman.  But apparently for most of its history, the rule has been a bit tyrannical, autocratic, and perhaps very similar to Chile.  Are there any lessons to be drawn?</p>
<p>I would welcome Angry Bear commentators to chime in and help illuminate readers on the post-1953 history of South Korea.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update from PGL</strong>: Thanks to Fermi Pyle who suggested that we check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung-hee">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngman_Rhee">this</a> out.  Syngman Rhee was a dictator known for conducting several massacres, letting his own citizens be trapped in Seoul as the Communists marched in, and vetoing any peace plan to further his own ambitions.  Park Chung-hee took advantage of the following to lead a coup:</p>
<blockquote><p>the new government was caught between an economy that was suffering from a decade of mismanagement and corruption by the Rhee presidency and the students who had led to Rhee&#8217;s ouster. The students were regularly filling the streets, making numerous and wide-ranging demands for political and economic reforms. Law and order could not be maintained because the police, long an instrument of the Rhee government, were demoralized and had been completely discredited by the public. Continued factional wrangling caused the public to turn away from the party.</p></blockquote>
<p>But rightwingers seem to love Rhee as he was an anti-Communist.  While the Park regime saw South Korea’s economy grow, he also clamped down on personal freedoms.  He allowed Korea’s CIA broad powers to arrest and detain citizens and his political opponents were not only arrested but also tortured.  Yes, voting was allowed but:</p>
<blockquote><p>The electoral system was also heavily rigged in favor of Park&#8217;s Democratic Republican Party, which routinely won large majorities in the National Assembly. Opposition parties and leaders were subjected to varying degrees of official harassment. In spite of this, Park was narrowly reelected in 1967 against Yoon.</p></blockquote>

Their logic?  It was six months ago.  <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/iraq/story/27346.html">Steve Lannen</a> reported just last week:</p>
<blockquote><p>Violence is increasing in Iraq, raising questions about whether the security improvements credited to the increase in U.S. troops may be short-lived.  Car bombs in Baghdad on Monday killed at least 11 people and injured a prominent leader of one of the country&#8217;s most influential American-allied tribal militias. The Ministry of Electricity announced that power to much of the nation, already anemic, is likely to lag in coming days because insurgents had blown up transmission facilities and natural gas pipelines that fuel generators.  CBS News confirmed that two of its journalists are missing in Basra, in Iraq&#8217;s south. A leading parliament member warned that budget disputes have paralyzed the legislature. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, finishing a two-day visit to Baghdad, said that he was likely to advocate a pause in troop withdrawals to evaluate the situation after the last of the additional troops sent here under President Bush&#8217;s so-called surge strategy had left later this year.  Gates made the remark after meeting for two hours with Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Iraq. Petraeus already has indicated that he wants to slow troop withdrawals to consolidate the past year&#8217;s security gains.</p></blockquote>
<p>So we had some security benefits from the surge but the concern now is that even those could be waning.  As far as economic and political stability – which most experts say is crucial – there does not seem to be that much progress.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/">Eyes on Trade</a> of Public Citizen Watch has an opinion piece worth reading on the WTO and trade agreements, with some useful links.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s our unfortunate duty here at EOT to have to read some truly mind-numbing trade law analyses of domestic regulation. For instance, have you ever really thought about whether electricity is a good or a service? Yesterday, I had to read through a 1998 WTO document that goes through this metaphysical question in excruciating detail. Short answer: if your electricity comes from coal, well then the coal itself is a good. But once it becomes electricity, it&#8217;s probably a service, because you can&#8217;t plop a piece of electricity down on your dinner plate.</p>
<p>Since the Bush I and Clinton I administrations committed many energy-related services to the restrictive WTO service sector agreements, there&#8217;s a good chance that many of Clinton, McCain and Obama&#8217;s proposals on energy could run afoul of WTO rules. So if the political reasons to talk fair trade weren&#8217;t compelling enough, there&#8217;s plenty of good policy reasons as well.</p>
<p>You may ask yourself, how did we get to the point where lawyers sat around thinking of basic human rights to turn into &#8220;tradeable commodities/services&#8221;? To paraphrase Larry the Cable Guy, this 1992 intellectual history article by William Drake and Kalypso Nicolaidis shows how corporate lobbyists &#8220;got-r-done&#8221;:</p>
<p>The very act of defining services transactions as ‘trade’ established normative presumptions that ‘free’ trade was the yardstick for good policy against which regulations, redefined as nontariff barriers (NTBs), should be measured and justified only exceptionally. Members believing there to be many justifiable exceptions thus had to defend what their counterparts label ‘protectionism.’… [the services trade lobby’s] body of work took on the attributes of a social science literature in which authors cited, critiqued, and built on each other&#8217;s analyses. But unlike most academic debates, in which contending theories and assumptions remain contested, the services discussion produced broad and lasting consensus on core concepts and objectives. Community members were by now unanimous in their dedication to the common policy project of placing services on the GATT agenda, and this relevance test precluded meta-theoretical differences of the sort familiar to political scientists. Disagreements were confined to the issue of which GATT principles and processes were right for which transactions, rather than to the question of whether services should be treated as trade in the first place.</p>
<p>This gets back to my point about how savvy corporate interests are at incrementalism. You don&#8217;t have to totally commoditize everything in a single day or single WTO round: just getting some definitions on the table can get the corporate animal spirits spirited up. Before you know it, public interest advocates are on the defensive, having to articulate why they thought regulation was necessary in the first place. And unfortunately, even many of our best politicians attempt to strike a &#8220;middle ground&#8221; between the previously unthinkable corporate takeover and the public interest, leading to a continual rightward drift.</p></blockquote>
<p>This statement is another take on trade agreements. When does &#8216;free trade&#8217; become &#8216;coercion&#8217;? And when does a linear and limited corporate culture (profit) become a replacement for a differently linear and limited governmental culture (good governance)?</p>
<p>Update: The links do not transfer, but it is worth the trip over.</p>
