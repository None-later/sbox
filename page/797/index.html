                                                                    </div>

                                <p>A lie is an assertion, believed to be false, made with the intention to deceive.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s essentially Bernard William&#8217;s definition of a lie on p. 96 of &#8220;Truth and Truthfulness.&#8221; It probably fits with how most of us think about a lie. But what about statements that use true facts to deceive?</p>
<p>August 31, <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2007/08/arguments-over-night-of-living-dead-in.html"> Juan Cole</a> was shrill about administration and media statements that GI deaths in Iraq were down for the year. His point was that temperatures get to 120 degrees, so summer means low combat. He produced a table contrasting 2006 with 2007 by month: deaths are higher in 2007 than 2006. He asked for a visual display and many responded. I&#8217;m posting mine here.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/Rt9eqfrfxHI/AAAAAAAAAB0/0BFCyRTAQ2A/s1600-h/GI_IraqDeaths.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/Rt9eqfrfxHI/AAAAAAAAAB0/0BFCyRTAQ2A/s400/GI_IraqDeaths.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />But this is just part of a pattern of communicating, where true facts are presented within a limited context, so that the resulting asymmetry of information creates a false impression. Most of us don&#8217;t know that Iraq temperatures reach 120 degrees in July so that physical activity like combat is down. On the other hand, if an official announced that lowland US snow fall in July was the lowest it&#8217;s been all year &#8212; duh. The difference is that here in the US we all know about July snow fall, so there&#8217;s no asymmetry.</p>
<p>Since there’s <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_09/011985.php"> some dispute</a> about the August combat casualties, for the following I will shift back to July. That doesn’t change the substance of the argument.</p>
<p>What do you think? The three-star general who <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=3437698"> reported</a> July deaths are down for the year &#8212; did he know that was because it was July, like we know about snow fall? Of course he did. The military needs to forecast its supply requirements. His staff forecasters incorporated the cycle, July is a low activity month. Surely that information reached the general. That&#8217;s like the Administration’s PhD economists had to know job creation was better in the US than in the EU and Japan because our population was growing at four times the rate as theirs. Nevertheless, they <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/10/eddie_lazear_sh.html"> write</a>, We’ve added more jobs “than all the jobs added in the European Union and Japan combined,” which suggested to most, because of asymmetric information, that the comparatively better job growth was the result of policy rather than the reality that it was because of an intrinsic phenomenon. There are many such examples.</p>
<p>So maybe, technically, these are not lies, because they assert true facts. But that doesn&#8217;t make them true statements. Paraphrasing <a href="http://stevenson.classicauthors.net/TruthOfIntercourse/"> Robert Lewis Stevenson</a>, a true statement does not just present true facts; a true statement is one that conveys a true impression. “July GI fatalities are the lowest for the year” is a true fact. On the other hand, “GI fatalities are higher every month so far this year compared with last”, is also a true fact. It&#8217;s the latter, however, not the former, that conveys a true impression.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton has stated she would cut spending for contractor support for DoD by 50%. I tried to find her exact statement and instead found some testimony concerning waste and abuse in Army contracts in Iraq.</p>
<p>She seems to have figured it out from the <a href="http://www.justhillary.com/herwords/pentagon0419.php">following exchange</a> that took place on 19 Apr 2007; Senator Clinton to Assistant Sec Army Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, Claude Bolton (Pentagon insider, retired AF general, who &#8220;survived the C-17 scandals of 1989):</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
<blockquote>Clinton: Here are a few excerpts from some of the DoD documents from July 2005: </p>
<p>There were concerns as to &#8220;the contractors&#8217; reluctance to down-size the labor force after the transfer or support missions to the sustainment contractor.&#8221; Also, July 2005, &#8220;The use of self-directed work added additional cost to the task order with no visible benefit to the government. &#8221; March 2006, &#8220;There was no effort to coordinate with the contracting officer to de-scope changes based on the reduction requirements and to establish a new definite price.&#8221; April 2006, &#8220;Command personnel advised us that the contractor wouldn&#8217;t move idle personnel or equipment assigned from one task order to another task order to accomplish needed work. When we brought this situation to the attention of top contractor operational personnel, they informed us this was a company policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senator Clinton asks some questions excerpts from Mr Bolton&#8217;s answers:</p>
<p>Bolton: One (Army chartered committee) is to look at requirements. These are requirements that come on a regular basis from the commanders to make sure that the commander is getting what he or she really wants. Sometimes those requirements are inflated. </p></blockquote>
<p>Ilsm here: Interesting that commanders make requirements for idle labor, the congress has required service contracts be performance based, that is let the private sector determine the cost effective approach, not create a featherbedding scam in the area of responsibility. </p>
<p>Back to the document&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Bolton: And many times those bids are a lot larger and higher than we&#8217;d like them to be, so we put people in place to correct some of the things that you&#8217;ve just mentioned.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ilsm again: Here is where Bunny Greenhouse tried to stop one example of many, the 5 year no competition contract to Kellogg Brown Root (Halliburton). The performance was so necessary, they had no idea what was needed, but that they had to rush into 5 years of this kind of waste and abuse. Competition is the only way for the offerors to provide lean offers, removing competition left the Army and taxpayer holding the bag with no performance and continuing cost accumulation.</p>
<p>The answer to the company not moving idle labor hours being charged for nothing over to &#8220;real&#8221; work was &#8216;company policy&#8217;.</p>
<p>All the waste of US civil servants with overhead, general and administrative costs, good old boy (revolving door) management and profits. </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>This one was by ILSM.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2007/09/crandall-canyon-one-more-time.html">Peter Dorman</a> begins his post by making the laissez faire argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>The standard theory, which can be found in any labor economics textbook and even some principles texts, is that dangerous work is essentially a non-problem. Workers will only take a dangerous job if they get extra pay to compensate. This gives employers an incentive to make jobs safer up to the point when the cost of more safety exceeds the added wages they would have to pay. The result: the level of safety is efficient (marginal benefit of safety improvements equals marginal cost), workers with a taste for risk are efficiently matched with employers whose technologies make risk harder to reduce, and workers in dangerous jobs are no worse off than those in safe ones, since they have bigger bank accounts to keep them happy. There are two big regulatory implications: interference, like enforcing safety rules, is against the interest of both workers and employers, and the wage-safety tradeoff can be used to calculate a “value of statistical life”, which comes in handy whenever cost-benefit analyses need to be performed. I kid you not. The “consensus” view in the profession is that a wealth of empirical data validates this theory. The Environmental Protection Agency holds earnest discussions on whether the value of a life should be raised or lowered a bit, or perhaps set at a higher level for some groups (like the rich) compared to others.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peter sort of trashed this in his <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521553067">book</a> from eleven years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>This book provides a critical survey of conventional economic approaches to occupational safety and the analysis of environmental risk in general. The author concludes that unsafe work is not voluntary, that markets do not compensate workers for risk, and that attempts to put a monetary value on life and health are futile. He attributes the shortcomings of economic orthodoxy to its underlying approach to human decision-making and social interaction, and demonstrates that useful alternative approaches are available. The analysis is used to identify policies that combine effective regulation with democratic values.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>My father is a physcist. But when I decided to study economics, he started paying a bit of attention to the field so we&#8217;d have something to talk about. At one point, he told me: &#8220;Economics now is where Physics was before Galileo.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about that, and I&#8217;d like to expand on the theme. Right now, Economics is bull$%!#. Plain and simple. And it is bull$%!# for the same reason physics was bull$%!#&#8230; because people prefer to believe in myth than reality, and so many institutions crop up to defend those myths so strongly that a) even those people who would prefer to believe in reality never get exposed to it under the relentless weight of &#8220;experts&#8221; telling them what reality really is and b) those that manage to figure out what reality is usually find it best to keep their mouth shut.</p>
<p>And, just as before (and in the centuries after) Galileo, the acceptable &#8220;physics&#8221; myths varied by location, our acceptable economics (and I&#8217;m not putting economics in quotes the way I put physics in quotes &#8211; we know what physics really is, but I don&#8217;t think any of us know what real economics might really look like)&#8230; in some countries, prices can be frozen or set by government fiat, in others, (such as our own) cutting taxes and shrinking government always produces more growth. </p>
<p>I want to focus on the myths we believe in here in the US&#8230; we have fewer excuses than folks elsewhere. After all, supposedly we are free to open our mouth and make up our own minds, so we should be the most free to arrive at some form of economics that is &#8220;right.&#8221; And we worship technology enough to have made the data easily available&#8230;. its all there, at the BEA, the OMB, the BLS, the IRS, and so forth. And we all have access to computers and spreadsheets (no need for fancy statistics, just as there really was no need for fancy Latin prayers to determine whether you can transmute lead into gold) when Galileo was running around.</p>
<p>As I noted the other day&#8230; perhaps the most important question in economics, as it stands now, is what leads to faster growth&#8230; in particular, what is the optimal size of government, or what are the tax rates that lead to the fastest possible growth. And in fact, there are a lot of very well funded organizations and think tanks and universities that produce carefully worded studies that address these topics. But they generally find&#8230; we have to cut taxes more, and decrease the size of government.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m no academic (despite the 5 years adjuncting), and I&#8217;m certainly not angling for a position in academia, but I think what would happen to someone in any of the think tanks who pointed out that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/tax-rates-and-economic-growth-look-at.html">growth rates are higher at much, much higher tax rates than we observe now, and tax cuts have not usually led to faster growth rates than tax hikes</a>. No theorizing, just pointing out the data. Because we all know that tax cuts and smaller government lead to faster growth (aren&#8217;t Republicans supposed to be better for the economy?), even though we have over a hundred years of experience watching Alabama and Massachusetts. </p>
<p>But a lot of people know what the data shows&#8230; but they don&#8217;t say a word. Anyone think the Dean of the business school and the Harvard Professor that advised the current president on the economy and are now advising the front runner on the Republican side don&#8217;t know what the data shows?</p>
<p>In the end&#8230; the reason economics is bull$%!# is because the practitioners have allowed it to remain bull$%!#. And this is a problem&#8230; how many people died because physics remained bull$%!# for so long? And chemistry? And biology? How much further along would we be if things had changed centuries earlier? And the same is true of economics. How much farther along would we be if every president since WW2 had achieve JFK/LBJ&#8217;s growth rates? Or failing that, Clinton&#8217;s?</p>
<p>Put another way&#8230; this is not a game. Any movement toward and not away from the optimal tax rates and optimal size of government makes us better off, and movements away from the optima hurt us.  The people who choose to perpetuate the myths and the bull$%!# are harming the country. What does that say about the ones that are smart enough to know they are perpetuating myths and the bull$%!#?</p>

<blockquote><p>More than four years after declaring &#8221; Mission Accomplished&#8221; in Iraq, Bush still can&#8217;t make an announced visit to the war-wracked country.</p>
<p>But his supposed &#8220;visit to Anbar Province&#8221; was in some ways even more cynical &#8212; and accepted even more gullibly by the media &#8212; than his June 2006 visit to Baghdad. There, at least, he actually set foot on Iraqi soil.</p>
<p>This time, Bush visited Al-Asad Air Base &#8212; an enormous, heavily fortified American outpost for 10,000 troops that while technically in Anbar Province in fact has a 13-mile perimeter keeping Iraq &#8212; and Iraqis &#8212; at bay. Bush never left the confines of the base, known as &#8220;Camp Cupcake,&#8221; for its relatively luxurious facilities, but nevertheless announced: &#8220;When you stand on the ground here in Anbar and hear from the people who live here, you can see what the future of Iraq can look like.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

But most of us recall how much the use of mathematics assisted our understanding of economic theory even from our undergraduate texts.  </p>
<p><a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/09/why-we-use-math.html">Dani Rodrik</a> recalls when he was getting his masters degree:</p>
<blockquote><p>So I tell them a story about Sir W. Arthur Lewis. When I was a master&#8217;s student myself at Princeton, I once attended a lecture that he gave on real wages, the commodity terms of trade, and North-South income differentials.  The talk had no math in it. One of the younger faculty members of the economics department was sitting in the front row, and I could see him scratching his head in confusion throughout the talk.  A few minutes after Sir Arthur was done, this young professor jumped up in excitement and went up to the board. &#8220;Now I get it!&#8221; he exclaimed and began to scribble some equations on the board.  &#8220;This is the equation which relates to what you said in the first part of your talk, and this one expresses the other, and here is a third&#8230; and now finally we have three independent equations that determines your three endogenous variables&#8230;&#8221;  Sir Arthur kept on his bemused smile as his lecture was explained to him in mathematical terms. The moral of the story is that if you are smart enough to be a Nobel-prize winning economist maybe you can do without the math, but the rest of us mere mortals cannot. We need the math to make sure that we think straight&#8211;to ensure that our conclusions follow from our premises and that we haven&#8217;t left loose ends hanging in our argument.  In other words, we use math not because we are smart, but because we are not smart enough. We are just smart enough to recognize that we are not smart enough. And this recognition, I tell our students, will set them apart from a lot of people out there with very strong opinions about what to do about poverty and underdevelopment.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>A big problem in health care is the non-compliant patient. Non-compliance can be in the form of disobeying orders or advice, or simply by blowing off doctor visits (if you don’t hear the bad news it isn’t news, right?).</p>
<p>Well, maybe there is a solution.</p>
<p>Presidential candidate John Edwards says that under his universal health care program everyone WILL see the doctor for preventive care. Women WILL have mammograms.</p>
<p>No word on the enforcement mechanism.</p>
<p>In the UK, a panel of Conservative MPs have a recommendation that Brits who live an unhealthy lifestyle should not receive certain types of care. The healthy lifestyle initiative would also be tied to health care service reforms and various social initiatives including housing and schooling reforms.</p>
<p>Brits who live healthy lifestyles would be rewarded by receving points to be used for vegetables and gym memberships.</p>
<p>Is this the future of health care? Slightly Orwellian?</p>
<p>No word if Edwards will give us veggies.</p>
<p>Seriously, is this the way to deal with non-compliance? Is there a better way?</p>

<blockquote><p>Buyers from the nation’s leading department stores will sift through the work of hundreds of designers as another Fashion Week begins today in New York, seeking the looks that shoppers will want to wear next spring. Seema Anand will be looking for the ones they want right now.  Ms. Anand, who will be following the catwalk shows through photographs posted instantly on the Web, is a designer few would recognize, even though she has dressed more people than most of the famous designers exhibiting a few blocks from her garment district studio, under the tents in Bryant Park. “If I see something on Style.com, all I have to do is e-mail the picture to my factory and say, ‘I want something similar, or a silhouette made just like this,’ ” Ms. Anand said. The factory, in Jaipur, India, can deliver stores a knockoff months before the designer version. Ms. Anand compared a gold sequined tunic she created with a nearly identical one by the designer Tory Burch. Bloomingdale’s had asked her to make several hundred of the dresses for its private label Aqua, she said. The Tory Burch dress sells for $750; Ms. Anand’s is $260. Ms. Anand’s company, Simonia Fashions, is one of hundreds that make less expensive clothes inspired by other designers’ runway looks, for trendy stores like Forever 21 and retail behemoths like Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would seem some in the industry don’t like competition and what the Federal government to outlaw it:</p>
<blockquote><p>A debate is raging in the American fashion industry over such designs. Copying, which has always existed in fashion, has become so pervasive in the Internet era it is now the No. 1 priority of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which is lobbying Congress to extend copyright protection to clothing. Nine senators introduced a bill last month to support the designers. An expert working with the designers’ trade group estimates that knockoffs represent a minimum of 5 percent of the $181 billion American apparel market.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=09&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=designer_fashion_the_benefits">Dean Baker</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>While designers would predictably be unhappy with this situation, the availability of low cost copies of designer fashions would lead to substantial economic gains, just as lowering tariffs leads to economic gains.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>A story about Iraq in the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-surge4sep04,0,2280359,full.story?coll=la-home-center">LA Times</a> includes this:</p>
<blockquote><p>People who describe their neighborhoods as calm often attribute this to the sectarian &#8220;cleansing&#8221; of Sunnis or Shiites. Many say that better security is attributable to a heavy U.S. presence in their neighborhoods and that whenever those troops scale down operations, trouble returns.</p>
<p>Hamid Abdul Kareem, a supermarket owner in the northeastern neighborhood of Shaab, said the area was relatively secure. He said that was because of an exodus of Sunni families from Shaab, where the Mahdi Army loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr has a strong presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunnis still live in the region, but I think within the next year, the region will be totally Shiite,&#8221; Kareem said.</p>
<p>Hassan Shimari is one such Sunni. He lives in Shaab with his wife, a Shiite. He also wears a beard and is grateful for his dark complexion because it makes him look more Shiite than Sunni.</p>
<p>He said Shaab was quiet because Sunnis were lying low and because there was still enough of an American presence there to keep Shiite militias under control.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is any weakening of the American forces here, it will be very, very bad,&#8221; said Shimari, a taxi driver. &#8220;In the last three days, I&#8217;ve driven four families at 6 in the morning to travel companies so they could leave for Syria. Those who can afford it leave.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Determining accurate civilian death tolls is virtually impossible in Iraq, where the government has no single source for reporting deaths related to the war. Whichever numbers one uses, however, it is clear that thousands of Iraqis continue to be slain or driven from their homes.</p>
<p>According to U.S. military figures, an average of 1,000 Iraqis have died each month since March in sectarian violence. That compares with about 1,200 a month at the start of the security plan, the military said in an e-mailed response to queries. This does not include deaths from car bombings, which the military said have numbered more than 2,600 this year.</p>
<p>Figures from Iraqi government ministries point to far higher casualty numbers and show that this year, an average of 1,724 civilians a month have died in sectarian attacks, bombings and other war-related violence.</p>
<p>In February, the civilian death toll was 1,646. Last month, it was 1,773, according to numbers from officials in the ministries of Defense, Interior and Health, who cite morgue, hospital and police reports. It was the second straight month that casualties have increased since the security plan began.</p>
<p>Dana Graber-Ladek of the International Organization for Migration said internal displacement had escalated since the troop buildup began. The increase is partly because of people fleeing military offensives, and partly because of better record-keeping by the Ministry for Displacement and Migration, Graber-Ladek said.</p>
<p>But 63% of those displaced this year said they had moved because of threats to their security, according to the International Organization for Migration. One-fourth said they were forced from their homes.</p>
<p>The organization also said that 69% of newly displaced Iraqis had left homes in Baghdad, a sign that sectarian cleansing continues in the capital. These people had either moved to new neighborhoods in the capital or had left Baghdad altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, Iraqis are fleeing because they flee for their lives,&#8221; Graber-Ladek said. &#8220;As long as the violence continues, displacement will continue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If the US stays long enough, there will be peace in Iraq&#8230; because everyone the &#8220;cleansers&#8221; want to cleanse will be cleansed. Of course, that will also happen if the US leaves tomorrow.  I don&#8217;t recall any of this being part of the rationale for war.</p>

                                <p>This post looks at the relationship between tax rates and economic growth. Because this is a controversial subject, I will approach this methodically, and also (where possible) approach the problem (and the solution) from more than one angle. It makes for a long post, so be forewarned. If you want to read it, make sure your chair is comfortable.</p>
<p>Here’s the plan… First, look at how the top marginal income tax rate, the bottom marginal income tax rate, and the top capital gains tax rate evolved over time beginning in Ike’s term graphically. Next, look at the growth rate of real GDP per capita observed at these different tax rates. Where possible, when a “maximum” or optimal point is uncovered, use correlations between tax rates and growth rates to confirm whether that point truly is a maximum. </p>
<p>Real GDP per capita comes from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">NIPA BEA Table 7.1</a>. The highest and lowest marginal tax rates come from <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histaba.pdf">this IRS document</a>. Capital gains tax rates come from <a href="http://www.ctj.org/pdf/regcg.pdf">Citizens for Tax Justice</a>. Regular readers are aware I prefer to get data directly from the source, but after 30 minutes I didn’t find the time series on the IRS website. I’m sure its there, I’m just not finding it. That said, the data does seem to match my recollections, and while Citizens for Tax Justice might be a biased source, I suspect they got the data right. </p>
<p>So let’s start by looking at how these tax rates have evolved over time…</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzLZk9FIyI/AAAAAAAAArQ/pqC1ObtFsWE/s1600-h/Tax+Rates,+Graph+3+-+Capital+Gains+Tax+Rate.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzLZk9FIyI/AAAAAAAAArQ/pqC1ObtFsWE/s320/Tax+Rates,+Graph+3+-+Capital+Gains+Tax+Rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>We can group the top rates into a few categories…. There are many ways to skin a cat, so to speak, but I think a natural division (trying to keep bunches of tax rates together, and where possible, trying to keep the bunches more or less of the same size) might be the following:</p>
<p>Group 1: 90% to 93%, 11 observations<br />Group 2: 78% to 69%, 18 observations<br />Group 3: 60% to 50%, 5 observations<br />Group 4: 40% to 36%, 11 observations<br />Group 5: 36% to 25%, 9 observations</p>
<p>Similarly, the bottom marginal rates could probably be grouped as follows:</p>
<p>Group 1: 20% to 23%, 11 observations<br />Group 2: 15% to 20%, 14 observations<br />Group 3: 14% to 15%, 17 observations<br />Group 4: 11% to 14%, 6 observations<br />Group 5: 10% to 11%, 6 observations</p>
<p>Finally, we can group the capital gains tax into the following categories:</p>
<p>Group 1, 35% to 40%, 7 observations<br />Group 2, 30% to 35%, 5 observations<br />Group 3, 25% to 30%, 26 observations<br />Group 4, 20% to 25%, 12 observations<br />Group 5, 15% to 20%, 4 observations</p>
<p>Admittedly, other divisions are possible, but for the most part, unless one’s intent is some serious cherry picking, it won’t make much a different to much of what we’re going to do on the rest of the post. (I’ve tried a few breakdowns for grins but I’m not including them due to the length of the post.) </p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the top marginal rate and how it compares to growth rates since 1953…</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzMy09FI3I/AAAAAAAAAr4/XCPGqqYr8NU/s1600-h/Tax+Rates+and+Growth+Rates,+Graph+1+-+Top+Marginal+Rate.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzMy09FI3I/AAAAAAAAAr4/XCPGqqYr8NU/s320/Tax+Rates+and+Growth+Rates,+Graph+1+-+Top+Marginal+Rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>What we see is that when the rate is “too high”, growth rates are pretty low – presumably this is because the high tax rates discourage private enterprise. Similarly, when tax rates are “too low”, growth rates are low – this is probably because in such instances, the government shrinks too much to provide services essential to economic growth, or it must borrow heavily to finance its activities. (Put another way… taxes are too high when the private sector can make better use of a marginal dollar than the government, and they are too low when the government can make better use of a marginal dollar than the private sector.) So what’s the happy medium? Highest observed growth rates occurred when the top marginal rte was between 50% and 60%. And the shape of the distribution seems to bear out that this range is the optimum.</p>
<p>But this could be mere coincidence. Luck and whatever else. Its certainly heresy to anyone who has ever voted Republican. So its worth taking another bite at this apple. And here’s how we’ll do it. If there is a such a relationship, call it a “Laffer curve for growth”, then at points to the left of the optimum, we should expect, on average, that increasing the tax rates should lead to faster growth rates, and at points to the right of the optimum, we should expect, on average, that decreasing the tax rate should lead to faster growth rates. Put another way, when tax rates are below the optimum, the tax rate will be positively correlated with growth. Conversely, when tax rates are above the optimal level, we would expect to see the tax rate negatively correlated with growth.</p>
<p>Below is a table showing that relationship…</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzNK09FI7I/AAAAAAAAAsY/FXobEWrH2LE/s1600-h/correlations+between+tax+rates+and+growth+rates,+Graph+1+-+Top+Marginal+Rate.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzNK09FI7I/AAAAAAAAAsY/FXobEWrH2LE/s320/correlations+between+tax+rates+and+growth+rates,+Graph+1+-+Top+Marginal+Rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The first row can be interpreted as follows… when the top marginal tax rates are equal to or lower than 39%, the correlation between the top marginal tax rates and the growth in real GDP per capita is equal to –0.08. Similarly, the correlation between tax rates and growth rates is 0.02 when tax rates are above 39%. Anyway, none of the correlations are especially high – not surprising given the fact that we’re only looking at one variable (i.e., top marginal tax rate) to explain growth, but nevertheless, the signs of the correlations are as we expect for the range we’re observing, and the highest sum of absolute lower and higher correlations seem to occur in the range the earlier graph led us to expect.</p>
<p>Thus, given the historical data, it seems that a) the fastest growth rates were observed when marginal tax rates were between 50% and 60%, and a simple test of correlations provides a bit of support to the hypothesis that the tax rate that provides the fastest growth is indeed somewhere in the vicinity. Is this conclusive evidence? Heck no – I’m well aware people much smarter than I have used far more sophisticated tools to do this sort of work, but as time goes on I’m more and more convinced of the value of using simple tools. One thing I think is evident from the graph and the correlations… there isn’t much in the data to support having the top marginal tax rate at the current 35% rate if one wants to encourage growth, and there is even less in the data to support cutting the top marginal tax rates any more as some Presidential candidates have advocated.</p>
<p>Moving along, we do the same thing for the bottom marginal rate. Here’s the graph.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzMuU9FI2I/AAAAAAAAArw/etvQf4iBDcs/s1600-h/Tax+Rates+and+Growth+Rates,+Graph+2+-+Bottom+Marginal+Rate.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzMuU9FI2I/AAAAAAAAArw/etvQf4iBDcs/s320/Tax+Rates+and+Growth+Rates,+Graph+2+-+Bottom+Marginal+Rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Notice that again we get the familiar bow shaped curve. And once again, the optimum is evident… somewhere in the neighborhood of 11% to 14%. Which in fact, is not too far distant from the range which we’ve seen in the not very distant past. (And for the economists among us… charging low income people lower rates than the high income individuals makes sense – the former have a higher marginal propensity to consume, so the multiplier effect is going to be much larger when their tax rates are very low relative to the tax rates faced by those with high incomes. Personally, I think taxes should go on wealth and not income, but that’s another story.)</p>
<p>Now the correlations between the lowest marginal income tax rates and real GDP per capita…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzNGU9FI6I/AAAAAAAAAsQ/zakEGksiTbI/s1600-h/correlations+between+tax+rates+and+growth+rates,+Graph+2+-+Bottom+Marginal+Rate.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzNGU9FI6I/AAAAAAAAAsQ/zakEGksiTbI/s320/correlations+between+tax+rates+and+growth+rates,+Graph+2+-+Bottom+Marginal+Rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Seems the 11% to 14% range looks most plausible closer to the 11% rate.</p>
<p>Now what about capital gains tax rates? Here’s the picture.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzMpE9FI1I/AAAAAAAAAro/X01q1ZGy0QM/s1600-h/Tax+Rates+and+Growth+Rates,+Graph+3+-+Capital+Gains+Rate.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzMpE9FI1I/AAAAAAAAAro/X01q1ZGy0QM/s320/Tax+Rates+and+Growth+Rates,+Graph+3+-+Capital+Gains+Rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Well, we have a problem… it seems we don’t have the familiar bow shape … it may be because we simply haven’t observed rates larger than the optimum, because while the graph suggests 20% to 25% may constitute a local optimum, it also suggests that the overall optimum is at least in the 35% to 40% range. Sadly, the shape of this curve precludes much of a correlation analysis – we simply don’t have observations above the 35% to 40% range. </p>
<p>What we learn from this is that regardless of how one chooses to interpret the graph, the current 15% capital gains tax is way too low – keeping tax rates that low is reducing economic growth and hurting us all, including those who pay taxes on capital gains. (In the short term they may be better off paying less in capital gains, but it comes at a cost of less economic growth which in turn decreases their income opportunities.) </p>
<p>This post is getting way too long, but I want to add in a few details… I want to check the results of tax cuts themselves, and compare them to tax hikes.</p>
<p>The graph below shows the median and average growth rates in the year of a cut in the highest marginal tax rate, the year after such a tax cut, two years after such a tax cut, three years after a tax cut, and four years after such a tax cut. It also shows the same after a tax hike. (Note… there have been instances where a change in tax rates in one direction was quickly followed by a change in tax rates in the other direction, one or two years later. For instance, in 1969, there was a tax hike, followed by a tax cut in 1970. I count the tax hike in 1969, but don’t count 1970 as one year following a tax hike or 1971 as two years following a tax hike since the more recent tax cut nullifies the hike. Note also.. there have been 12 cuts in the highest marginal rate, and four hikes in the sample.) </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzNAk9FI5I/AAAAAAAAAsI/FjG76oEgTqg/s1600-h/Tax+Cuts+and+Tax+Increases,+Graph+1+-+Top+Marginal+Tax+Rate.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzNAk9FI5I/AAAAAAAAAsI/FjG76oEgTqg/s320/Tax+Cuts+and+Tax+Increases,+Graph+1+-+Top+Marginal+Tax+Rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>What does this show? Well, it shows that the economy has grown faster two years after a cut in the highest marginal tax rate than two years after a hike in the highest marginal tax rate. Similarly, it has grown faster three years after a highest marginal rate tax cut than three years after a highest marginal rate tax hike. But&#8230; growth rates are slower in the year of a highest marginal tax cut than the year of a highest marginal rate tax hike, as well as one year out and four years out. This isn’t much data, but its clearly not exactly evidence that cutting the highest marginal tax rates is any kind of a growth producer.</p>
<p>What about cutting the lowest marginal rate? Well, there’s only one year in which there was a tax cut, so it kind of not instructive.</p>
<p>What about cutting the capital gains tax rate? Seven cuts, eight hikes…</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzM509FI4I/AAAAAAAAAsA/XpLPQxpucE4/s1600-h/Tax+Cuts+and+Tax+Increases,+Graph+3+-+Capital+Gains+Tax.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzM509FI4I/AAAAAAAAAsA/XpLPQxpucE4/s320/Tax+Cuts+and+Tax+Increases,+Graph+3+-+Capital+Gains+Tax.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Results are similar to cutting the highest marginal rate. Put another way&#8230; in the five years beginning with a change to the tax rate, tax cuts are associated with faster growth than tax hikes 40% of the time, and with slower growth than tax hikes 60% of the time. </p>
<p>Cuts beat hikes 2 years out and 3 years out, and are beaten year of, year after, and are walloped 4 years out. Again… cutting the capital gains tax rate isn’t exactly a formula for super duper growth.</p>
<p>So&#8230; what can we conclude from all this? Well, there isn&#8217;t much evidence that cutting tax rates, at least to high income earners and on capital gains, will lead to faster growth. In fact, it would seem that since Nixon&#8217;s time, tax rates have been below the &#8220;optimal&#8221; level for generating growth, possibly even leading to slower growth over the past thirty five years or so. </p>
<p>This post may go some way toward explaining why since Ike took office, Democratic Presidents have generally produced faster rates of growth in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">real GDP per capita</a> than their Republican counterparts. Some time soon I’m going to look at that in more detail.</p>
<p>(Note to regular readers who may be wondering why I did the entire analysis for real GDP per capita, as opposed to my favorite measure, real (GDP – change in the national debt) per capita. Basically, I wanted this to be as easy to replicate as possible. Also, those parts of the analysis I did using that measure of growth were even more damning of the “tax cutting” philosophy.)</p>
