                                <p>After the London train bombings the following website and its credo went up.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.werenotafraid.com/about.html">We are not afraid</a><br />
<blockquote>We are not afraid to ride public transportation.</p>
<p>We are not afraid to walk down a crowded street.</p>
<p>We are not afraid of each other.</p>
<p>We are not afraid to say that terrorism in any form is never the answer.</p>
<p><i>We’re not afraid</i> is an outlet for the global community to speak out against the acts of terror that have struck London, Madrid, New York, Baghdad, Basra, Tikrit, Gaza, Tel-Aviv, Afghanistan, Bali, and against the atrocities occurring in cities around the world each and every day. It is a worldwide action for people not willing to be cowed by terrorism and fear mongering.</p>
<p>The historical response to these types of attacks has been a show of deadly force; we believe that there is a better way. We refuse to respond to aggression and hatred in kind. Instead, we who are not afraid will continue to live our lives the best way we know how. We will work, we will play, we will laugh, we will live. We will not waste one moment, nor sacrifice one bit of our freedom, because of fear.</p>
<p>We are not afraid.</p></blockquote>
<p>Contrast this to the reaction in what we can call Beck-merica, where fear overcame any sense of proportion, and civil rights simply surrendered to authority. Londoners picked themselves up, Americans rushed through the PATRIOT Act and bought flag magnets for their cars.</p>

<p>So a rude idiot shouts &#8220;you lie&#8221; and Obama decides he has to punish undocumented aliens.  This is not about subsidies which were clearly not on offer yesterday.  This is about making it harder for them to pay the full price of insurance.  </p>
<p>That way they won&#8217;t give US citizens their infectious diseases.  Uhm well but they are illgal so it&#8217;s worth it.  </p>

<p>In response to a critical comment, I have decided to actually read the article which I stopped reading when it said the Journal of Monetary Economics was a must publish journal for young economists.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/07/priceless-how-the-federal_n_278805.html">Ryan Grim asserts that economists don&#8217;t criticize the Fed because the Fed has bought control of the economics profession.</a><br />I have three general impressions.  First the sourcing is very odd.  There are fairly few academic economists quoted and two of them firmly contest Ryan Grim&#8217;s thesis.  <br />Second it is assumed that the Federal Reserve System is a centrally controlled disciplined organization.  Grim explicitly includes regional Federal Reserve Banks.  Thus he assumes that the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is identical to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  This is a bold assumption.  Finally, he is convinced that the economists who might comment on the FED are &#8220;monetary economists.&#8221;   I have met macroeconomists and economists who work on money banking and credit, but I don&#8217;t recall ever meeting a monetary economist.  </p>
<p>I have no idea how much influence the Fed has on the debate in the profession (really) and certainly agree that the economics profession is dangerously in bred and that it is much much much better for an economist to be conventionally wrong than unconventionally right (but it&#8217;s gotten better in the past 20 years).</p>
<p>More detailed comments after the jump.</p>
<p>OK editorial standards.  Grims list of the journals that he considers important follows</p>
<p>The Huffington Post reviewed the mastheads of </p>
<p>the American Journal of Economics, the Journal of Economic Perspectives, Journal of Economic Literature, the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, the Journal of Political Economy and the Journal of Monetary Economics.</p>
<p>The list does not appear to include the American Economic Review which is a bit more important than the American Journal of Economics.  It also doesn&#8217;t include the Quarterly Journal, Econometrica, The Review of Economic Studies, The Journal of Economic Theory or, well, any of the really top journals except for the Journal of Political Economy.</p>
<p>The Journal of Economic Literature is mainly an index of articles.  It contains review articles and book reviews (partly I think so that it can be shipped with the special rate for journals).  The journal of economic perspectives doesn&#8217;t really publish research exactly &#8212; articles are meant to be easily understood so its role is, in very large part, divulgative.</p>
<p>Grim attempts to explain why economists didn&#8217;t warn of the financial crisis before it hit, in part, by having interns google members of the boards of <br />the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, American Economic Journal: Economic Policy</p>
<p>I quote from the Wikipedia </p>
<blockquote><p>American Economic Journal is a group of four peer-reviewed academic journals published by the American Economic Association. The names of the individual journals consist of the prefix American Economic Journal with a descriptor of the field attached. The four field journals which started in 2009 are Applied Economics, Economic Policy, Macroeconomics, and Microeconomics.</p></blockquote>
<p>it is a bit harsh to blame the editors of journals which started publishing in 2009 for the failure to warn of the events of September 2008.  I think normal courtesy would compel someone to wikipedia a journal title before having interns google its board of editors.</p>
<p>On lumping regional banks in with the board of governors, Grim argues that Bernanke controls the JME partly by noting that many editors of the JME are affiliated with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.  This is not a joke.</p>
<p>Now as to the universe of critics the Fed might want to buy off.  Grim assumes that it consists of &#8220;monetary economists&#8221; who are distinct from macroeconomists of finance economists.  I don&#8217;t think there is such a group of people (name one).<br />Yet oddly, he considers many people who are not monetary economists valid critics of the Fed.  He quotes Joshua Rosner, a Wall Street analyst,  James Galbraith (who sure knows what he&#8217;s talking about but probably doesn&#8217;t &#8220;list &#8216;monetary policy, central banking, and the supply of money and credit,&#8217; as either their primary or secondary specialty,&#8221; (I will write &#8220;not monetary&#8221; below) Robert Auerbach, a former investigator with the House banking committee, Jane D&#8217;Arista, a Fed critic and an economist with the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts (not monetary) Robert King (who contests his thesis and is I&#8217;d guess not monetary), a letter from Milton Friedman (OK he&#8217;s got one monetary economist who criticizes the Fed), Economist Rob Johnson (OK maybe two), Ahmed Ehsan a self described monetary economist who disagrees with the thesis,  and Paul Krugman (not monetary).  </p>
<p>The thesis is that the Fed (including regional banks who take orders from the chairman evidently) controls most people who have standing to criticize the Fed.  Journalistic integrity requires checking if the critics of the Fed whose standing Grim considers adequate are on his list of people who have the standing to criticize the Fed.  I&#8217;d guess that at most one does (Friedman is, sadly, no longer a member of the AEA).</p>
<p>The economics profession is a very large very slow moving target, but it is possible to miss.</p>

<p>Arguments were heard by the U.S. Supreme Court this week as to whether restrictions on corporate political donations were constitutional or whether those corporations are protected by the First Amendment. Court watchers report that signs are that the Robert&#8217;s Court will so rule with the ruling due to be handed down around Oct 5. I&#8217;ll let those who like battle out the legal issues in comments. I want to know what would then prevent the following wholly fictional scenario?</p>
<blockquote><p>Flash forward to early Winter 2011 when in this era of the permanent campaign contenders for Election 2012 need to start their preparations. For the Republicans three faces have emerged. One is John Ellis, former political analyst for Fox News, most famous for being the first such analyst to call Florida for George W Bush in 2000. Ellis is expected to be backed by millions of dollars from his former employer NewsCorp, parent of Fox News, as well as substantial donations from the Carlyle Group, a privately held corporation with substantial but undetermined ownership interest held by Ellis&#8217;s uncle, former President George H.W. Bush. The other is former Tennessee Senator Dr. Bill Frist, jumping back in the political ring due to his concern about the impending socialization of medicine, but this time directly backed up by the resources of Hospital Corporation of American (HCA) founded and until recent years run by members of the Frist family. The third face is  surprise entrant Manuel G________, a wealthy third generation Mexican American little known outside Latino business, charitable, and religious circles. He currently is CEO of TelMUSA, a newly formed American subsidiary of  TelMex.</p>
<p>On the Democratic side two candidates have emerged to challenge President Obama from the Left. One is Darcy Burner {ed: I said fiction} former Microsoft exec, Congressional candidate, and first executive director of  the American Progressive Caucus Policy Foundation. A longtime favorite of the progressive wing of the Party she is expected to draw strong support from Microsoft and various investment companies owned by Microsoft co-founder and billionaire Paul Allen. A more long-shot candidate is Massachusetts based Peter M________. Born in Puerto Rico he is currently both an executive for Citgo and a long-time supporter of community organizing in cities throughout the Northeast. He has strong pledges of support from Citgo and its parent PDV America Inc.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. G and Mr. M are fictional as is TelMUSA, but the other persons and affiliations are real.</p>
<p>Well it is a problem of billionaires, and more particularly foreign billionaires. In this scenario John Ellis would be drawing his support from Australian billionaire Rubert Murdoch, his wealthy family&#8217;s interest in the Carlyle Group, itself with substantial ownership interest by high ranking members of the Saudi Arabian royal family including Prince Bandar. Then you have Bill Frist, drawing direct support from hospital giant HCA, source of his own substantial fortune. And finally Mr. G, a man who works in a direct line for Carlos Slim, the owner of TelMex and the third richest man in the world.</p>
<p>On the Democrat side you would have Darcy backed by two more of the wealthiest men and corporations in the person of Gates and Allan and Mr. M. working for the wholy owned American subsidiary of the Venezuelan government, a guy named Hugo Chavez.</p>
<p>So we really want to turn American political financing over to Prince Bandar, Rubert Murdoch, Carlos Slim, and God help us Hugo Chavez? Would we fill much better knowing that on the other side were balanced out candidates backed by companies largely owned and controlled by Gates, Allen and Frist&#8217;s wealthy family?</p>
<p>And you can make this a lot more sinister. Throw in U.S. companies controlled by people associated with Putin or with Chinese Government ownership interests and you can have a real nightmare. People on the Right blindly pushing to unleash American corporations need to remember that when you get to the big boys there mostly ain&#8217;t no such thing as an &#8220;American company&#8221;. Not anymore.<br />(Update: a reader reminds me that Murdoch is now a U.S. Citizen. This doesn&#8217;t materially effect the argument. The danger is from any billionaire or company buying politicians directly. Moreover Murdoch&#8217;s Wiki bio says he became a citizen simply to satisfy legal requirements for owners of TV stations and not out of some sense of real loyalty to the U.S.)</p>

                                <p>So I ran DataFerret in Batch mode. (I&#8217;m using other data and thought I would be nice.  Never again, apparently.)</p>
<p>Got the popup that said, &#8220;We&#8217;re gonna do it, dude.  You can pick it up later at URL.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the URL was (1) complicated and (2) <em>not</em> copyable from the popup.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t gotten an e-mail saying the data is ready, and haven&#8217;t been able to duplicate the URL.</p>
<p>Anyone who can tell me if I just have to Start Over, or if there is a way to find it?</p>

                                <p>Ken Houghton distracts us from the important things with an examination of monopoly power, asymmetric information, and perpetuating a bad business deal.</p>
<p>By the time Gary Bettman got to Phoenix, <a target="_blank" href="http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/postedsports/archive/2009/09/11/live-blog-battle-for-coyotes-continues.aspx">his lawyer was lying to the court</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;There are three things that it takes to be an owner of an NHL franchise. One, you&#8217;ve got to be wealthy &#8230; two, you&#8217;ve got to love hockey. And Mr.Balsillie, he has got both of these in his favour in spades. Nobody&#8217;s denying that. But number three, your Honour, you&#8217;ve got to play by the rules that bind NHL owners.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>My Loyal Reader notes that NHL owners are clearly bound by something. In at least one case, handcuffs. From <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2009/09/09/nhl-team-owner-gets-8-year-prison-sentence/">the WSJ, two days ago</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[William “Boots” Del Biaggio III’s] [bankruptcy] filing came amid lawsuits accusing him of fraudulently offering collateral he didn’t own to secure the loans he took out before buying the [NHL&#8217;s Nashville] Predators.</p>
<p>Del Biaggio pled guilty to forging financial documents in order to secure $110 million in loans from eight banks and National Hockey League owners Craig Leopold (of the Minnesota Wild) and AEG (of the Los Angeles Kings), loans that Del Biaggio used to buy his stake in the NHL team.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s good to see that the owners have a very strict policy when selecting owners, almost as sensible a policy as when they located a team in the Phoenix area in the first place. (Noted for the record: both the city of Phoenix and Scottsdale turned down the &#8220;opportunity&#8221; to have the Coyotes play in an arena there after the initial lease was up. Only Glendale was stupid enough to make an offer.)  I guess none of them owns a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rim.com/newsroom/media/executive/index.shtml">Blackberry</a>.<br />

<p>It appears that the worst tax ever TM is the brainchild of the normally sane Olympia Snowe.  <br />How could a sensible intelligent person come up with such a terrible idea ? <br />What is wrong with the leaky bucket metaphor for the economics of redistribution ?<br />What is the leaky bucket metaphor for the economics of redistribution ?<br />What is this worst tax ever anyway ?</p>
<p>Answers after the jump.</p>
<p>The worst tax ever TM is the proposal that large employers who don&#8217;t provide their employees with health insurance pay the subsidies that those employees receive.  It is a terrible tax, because the subsidies are supposed to go to people who need the money and the proposal will give firms incentives to avoid hiring people who need money and instead hire people who don&#8217;t.  </p>
<p>I think that Sen Snowe was confused, because she took the leaky bucket metaphor seriously.</p>
<p>The leaky bucket metaphor is very simple.  It is generally agreed that most taxes and transfers create dead weight losses because they distort incentives.  This means that the dollar benefit to the recipient is less than the dollar cost to the taxpayer.  If the recipient needs money more than the taxpayer, the transfer can increase average welfare, but not as much as it would if there were no dead weight losses.  This encourages the use of a metaphor that redistributing wealth is like carrying water in a leaky bucket.</p>
<p>If we tax the metaphor literally, we conclude that if we want to redistribute it is best to carry the leaky bucket a short distance than a long distance.  The loss of water is proportional to the distance we carry it.  </p>
<p>Returning to public economics we discover that this insight is worse than useless.  There is no meaningful way in which it is more efficient to redistribute wealth a short distance than a long distance.  </p>
<p>Simple models (public finance 101) suggest that income taxes are more efficient than excise taxes and that a broad based income tax is better than a narrow based one.  Basically, the standard result is that if the problem is that some people are poor and their is an opportunity because some other people are rich and have more money than they need then take from the rich and give to the poor.  This means that wealth will travel long distances (Say from Alaska to Mississippi) and that the net contributor will have nothing to do with the net recipient.</p>
<p>It very definitely says that the people bearing the burden should not just be the employer of the poor person.  Thus there is a presumption from public finance 101 that the earned income tax credit is more efficient than the minimum wage.  Similarly HR3200 (a payroll tax on large employers who don&#8217;t provide insurance) is more efficient than the Baucus Snowe plan.  I think the appeal to Snowe is that the money wouldn&#8217;t go far, just from an employer to an employee.  This pretty much maximises the social cost of the resulting dissincentive to hire.</p>
<p>The leaky bucket has played another role in the gang of six negotiations.  Back when he was pretending to negotiate, Sen Grassley used a stupid pun and stupid visual aids to denounce the HR3200 provision that subsidies be funded by a tax on high incomes. He insisted that money for health insurance subsidies must come from within the health sector.  Now there is a case for taxing especially expensive insurance, but this is not that case.</p>
<p>More generally, the employer mandate itself is a case of a mess made by the leaky bucket.  A tax funded single payer plan would probably be more efficient.  It is politically impossible for obvious reasons, but one very silly reason is that the money would appear in the federal budget.  Mandated insurance is like taxing the employuer and buying insurance for the employee, but mandated insurance does not appear as taxing and spending in the budget.  So what ? I mean it makes no difference so who cares ?</p>
<p>Most people care, but they shouldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Yesterday&#8217;s post on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/09/australiaescaped-total-meltdown-but.html">Australian economy</a> sparked some discussion of its housing market. I agree &#8211; Australia&#8217;s bubble is large relative to that in the US (interestingly enough) and Canada.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SqpHHo_ZLLI/AAAAAAAACgo/OFqtcp0ymeQ/s1600-h/bubble_chart.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SqpHHo_ZLLI/AAAAAAAACgo/OFqtcp0ymeQ/s400/bubble_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart illustrates the price to rent ratio in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, the UK, and the US, which measures the trade-off between owning and renting. Across country, the housing indices are not perfectly comparable &#8211; for example, <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/090911/dq090911b-eng.htm">Statistics Canada</a> measures the value of new homes, while the <a href="http://www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/pdf/index/SP_CS_Home_Price_Indices_Factsheet.pdf">S&#038;P/Case-Shiller</a> index measures repeat sales of existing homes. Furthermore, countries often measure the owner-equivalent rents differently. Nevertheless, the trends are meaningful.</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s bubble was (is) big, and relative to rents, home values recently turned upward. According to <a href="http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2009/08/30/debtwatch-no-38-the-gfc%E2%80%94pothole-or-mountain/">Steve Keen</a> (thank you reader VtCodger for the link), government subsidies provided households the incentive to leverage up their balance sheets while the private business sector deleveraged. Basically, the crash is yet to come.</p>
<p>The recent uptick in the Australian price-rent ratio, i.e., jump in housing prices relative to rents, is interesting. Notice the same is happening in the UK and Ireland; however in their cases, seriously weak economic conditions are dragging down the CPI housing index (the denominator). (In the UK, prices are likewise rising, but rents are falling faster.) As rents slide, so too will the relative attractiveness of home ownership.</p>
<p>I expect that the same will happen in the US. In Q2 2009, the <a href="http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/us/page.topic/indices_csmahp/2,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.html">S&#038;P/Case-Shiller</a> home price index grew 1.4%, faster than did the owner-occupied rents index in the CPI. Owner-occupied housing (see CPI table <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm">here</a>) inflation slowed dramatically in Q2; and given the long lag on core price fluctuations, there is a very good chance that it turns negative.</p>

<p>Hat tip to juan for the link to the Wednesday <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/analysis-two-precedents-in-jeopardy/#more-10669">SCOTUS blog</a> for this:</p>
<blockquote><p>If supporters of federal curbs on political campaign spending by corporations were counting on Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., and Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to hesitate to strike down such restrictions, they could take no comfort from the Supreme Court’s 93-minute hearing Wednesday on that historic question.  Despite the best efforts of four other Justices to argue for ruling only very narrowly, the strongest impression was that they had not convinced the two members of the Court thought to be still open to that approach.  At least the immediate prospect was for a sweeping declaration of independence in politics for companies and advocacy groups formed as corporations.</p>
<p>The Court probed deeply into Congress’ reasoning in its decades-long attempt to restrict corporate influence in campaigns for the Presidency and Congress, in a special sitting to hear a second time the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (08-205).  At issue was whether the Court was ready to overturn two of its precedents — one from 1990, the other from 2003 — upholding such limitations.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>&#8230;the Justices were heavily engaged in questioning four lawyers — two on each side of the question of overruling Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990) and McConnell v. FEC (2003).   Two former U.S. Solicitors General, the new SG — Elena Hagan — and the country’s leading free speech advocate — Floyd Abrams – argued energetically</p></blockquote>
<p>October 5 may be the final decision.</p>
