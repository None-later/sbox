                                <p>Some questions asked about Angry Bear moderation of comments need answered.  What it is not is a careful screening of content.  It is not even a screening for ad hominems pretty much, which might be done later if missed, but in public and noted.</p>
<p>Since deletion, disemvowelling, or other standard editing was not working due to the volume and vitrioloc nature of some of the commenters, pending moderation has been put into use.</p>
<p>Main posters come by and approve comments, but the criterion has been purposely kept extremely simple&#8230;it primarily is a way to delete the comments from those in coventry who start fights through ad hominems or slanderous comment, those in coventry who exceeded even our standards.  </p>
<p>I do not even read many comments in the process&#8230;the normal sorts of edits take care of the occasional swearing or ad hominems.  The &#8216;review&#8217; has nothing to do with political content, and does not involve editing unless clearly noted.  Enough of us moderate to make the system as close to immediate publication as is reasonable, which we think helps discussion.  You may have noticed paid sites use interns or teaching assistants&#8230;we are a working group without those particular resources. </p>
<p>So Paul, no, it is not like a magazine where letters to the editors are published after careful review to insure standards&#8230;it is a quick screening done as quickly as possible to screen out bile and slanders.  The election appears to have energised many, some of whom misbehave badly.</p>

<blockquote><p>The abuse of power investigation against Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate, took a potentially ominous turn for her party today when state lawmakers voted to subpoena her husband.</p>
<p>Republican efforts to delay the probe until after the Nov. 4 election were thwarted when GOP state Sen. Charlie Huggins, who represents Palin&#8217;s hometown of Wasilla, sided with Democrats. &#8220;Let&#8217;s just get the facts on the table,&#8221; said Huggins, who appeared in camouflage pants to vote during a break from moose hunting.</p>
<p>Thomas Van Flein, the Palins&#8217; private attorney now representing her as governor, did not immediately return calls for comment.</p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee acted at the request of investigator Stephen Branchflower, who is gathering evidence on whether Gov. Palin abused her power by firing Walt Monegan, the state&#8217;s director of public safety&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Are there any Alaskans out there who can help with the state level of politics?&#8230;this story feels incomplete from what I think I know of Alaskan politics.</p>

                                <p>A guest post to <a href="http://mudflats.wordpress.com/2008/09/12/karl-rove-comes-to-alaska/">Mudflats blog</a> is worth a look:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s Rep. Gara’s  take on McCain’s spin and interference with the bi-partisan “Troopergate” Investigation.  </p>
<p>Politicians are good at spin.  The McCain camp has brought a whole new level of it to our small state &#8211; in what looks like an effort to show they can play the same Karl Rove-like political games that have haunted this country for the last 8 years.  I like Governor Palin on a personal level.  But I don’t like what the McCain campaign is doing to our state.  I don’t like deception.  And I don’t like politics as usual.</p>
<p>Alaskans are starting to see evidence of a Karl Rove-like effort to stonewall what started as a non-controversial, bi-partisan ”Troopergate” investigation.  A little deception here.  A few personal attacks there.  And the kind of spin you see at an amusement park tilt-a-whirl station.   </p>
<p>This investigation was started by a Republican-dominated Alaska Legislature to look into Governor Palin’s conduct in seeking the termination of a State Trooper, once married to the Governor’s sister, Trooper Michael Wooten.  The McCain camp wants to stop it by saying it’s a “democratic” investigation.  Apart from facts, and the reputations the McCain folks don’t mind destroying, there’s not a lot standing in the way of this strategy.</p>
<p>Until August 29 “Troopergate” was a small state investigation Governor Palin, and every Republican and Democrat in a Republican-led Legislature had agreed was appropriate.  But things changed the day Governor Palin joined the McCain ticket.  His handlers went ballistic that the Governor agreed to an investigation they now needed to stop.</p>
<p>I know Senator McCain is now running on a political platform of ”change.”  Leave aside how he’ll fight to change what he’s voted to do to this country for the last 8 years.  If you ask me, the only thing he’s changed so far is Governor Palin’s position &#8211; her decision to cooperate with this once-small investigation.  </p>
<p>This is one of those cases where there’s a clear truth.  It’s a clear truth &#8211; about a bi-partisan investigation &#8211; that I hope McCain’s operatives will ultimately fail at spinning into a “partisan” plot against his running mate. </p>
<p>To get their way, and prevent sworn testimony from leaking out on what I suspect was probably a minor breach by Governor Palin, McCain’s operatives have come to Alaska to add invective in a state where people generally get along.  They’ve chosen to vilify: 1) one of the state’s most respected public officials, Senator Hollis French; 2) the state’s most respected law enforcement official, Walt Monegan; and 3) a highly respected former DA and Victims Rights advocate a legislative committee voted 12 &#8211; 0 to hire to conduct the investigation, Steve Branchflower.  </p>
<p>It’s the ghost of Karl Rove.  Say something untrue enough times &#8211; like that Al Qaida is training with Saddam Hussein’s help &#8211; and people will believe it.  Not this time.  I’m not sure if I mentioned a few important facts.</p>
<p>Did I mention that no one ever attacked the Troopergate investigation by Alaska’s Legislature &#8211; started long before Governor Palin was placed on McCain’s ticket &#8211; until August 29?  That was the day Governor Palin joined the McCain bid for the White House.  </p>
<p>Did I mention that before the McCain camp got involved, the Governor stated of the Legislative investigation:  “That being the route they choose, so be it.  I’m happy to comply, to cooperate.” (KTUU.com, July 24, 2008).  She repeatedly stated she’d comply, and that it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Did I mention the personal attacks against our local public officials only started after Sen. McCain sent his flacks up to our small state on August 29?  They came with a mission to make America believe a Republican-initiated investigation, started with a unanimous committee vote of 8 Republicans and 4 Democrats, was a “partisan” plot.  That’s only a tough sell if people know the facts.</p>
<p>Did I mention they now claim the Legislature cannot legally proceed with an investigation into government misconduct (I thought Republicans didn’t like attorneys who made frivolous arguments), and that they are threatening to to go to court to stop it?   The Governor’s attorneys started writing those letters on &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; August 29.  Before then they agreed the investigation was proper.</p>
<p>Oh, and what about this.  Last week the McCain camp put our Governor in a bizarre position.  They told her to file an ethics complaint against herself!  Yup, again after her VP nomination.  Too weird?  What’s behind this move?  You guessed it.  Lawyers.  </p>
<p>To create the legal argument that the Legislature cannot investigate government misconduct, the McCain team has had her file a complaint against herself before something called the State Personnel Board.  That’s a 3 member group of Republican Gubernatorial appointees &#8211; that, if it started this week, wouldn’t get an investigation done, and reported to the public, until after the November election.  Convenient.</p>
<p>Hmmm.  The Legislature has announced they’d have their investigation done &#8211; if witnesses would cooperate like they were until August 29 &#8211; by October 10.  I can’t imagine why the McCain camp would prefer an investigation that doesn’t get finished until after November.  Any ideas?</p>
<p>So what about the claim that this investigation is some sort of partisan plot against a Republican ticket?  A legislative committee of 8 Republicans and 4 democrats asked former Assistant District Attorney Hollis French, a Democrat &#8211; to hire a legislative investigator in July.  He did.  He’s not doing the investigation.  So the complaint that he’s a Democrat who supports Barack Obama  is, well, weak.  He’s a Democrat who supports Barack Obama, who was appointed before Governor Palin was a VP candidate.  More importantly, he’s a Senator who has the confidence of a majority Republican Senate.  </p>
<p>He once said to the press the results of the investigation are likely to be troubling.  He shouldn’t have said that.  But the Governor’s said it too.  The newspapers have said it.  We all know it.  The public record already contains evidence that the Department of Public Safety was contacted roughly 20 times by Palin senior staff, and her husband Todd, about firing Trooper Wooten.  The Governor has conceded that based on this evidence, the public could conclude the Department could have felt pressure from above to fire Trooper Wooten.</p>
<p>The investigator, Steve Branchflower, is a former DA and Office of Victims Rights head (a job he was appointed to by a Republican Legislature).  He’s actually conducting the investigation.  Attacking Senator French doesn’t really work if he’s not investigating the case, or making any findings.  So the McCain folks have attacked Mr. Branchflower.  And they’ve tried to stop him from issuing subpoenas to the witnesses now directed not to talk.  Today the McCain folks suffered a setback.  A bi-partisan committee of Republicans and Democrats authorized Mr. Branchflower to move ahead to subpoena those witnesses.</p>
<p>And for good measure &#8211; the McCain folks are attacking Walt Monegan &#8211; the Public Safety Commissioner Governor Palin fired.  The Troopergate investigation involves claims that Monegan was fired for not agreeing to fire Trooper Wooten, the Governor’s brother in law involved in a very ugly custody dispute with the Governor’s sister.  </p>
<p>I don’t begrudge the Governor for not liking her brother-in-law.  I don’t really like him either, from what I’ve read.  I do begrudge those who’d attack Commissioner Monegan, a quintessential public servant who’s worked for both Republican and Democratic heads on the state and local level.  </p>
<p>These three public servants deserve better.  What they’ve received so far, is a little dose of ugly Washington politics in a state where we don’t see that stuff too often.</p>
<p>I stood on the sidelines when this investigation started.  When Governor Palin fired Commissioner Monegan, my advice was to end the flap and just hire him back. He does good work.  He’s well respected.  Unfortunately, my advice sometimes isn’t that good, and the Governor didn’t agree.</p>
<p>Then McCain’s staff of outsiders came to town.  And they began to launch personal attacks on people I respect.  They started proving that the same old politics that have caused dissatisfaction with Washington insiders these past 8 years are going to be the bread and butter of the McCain campaign.  </p>
<p>So &#8211; here I am today.  I support an Obama presidency because he shares a vision I believe in.  I’ve publicly supported him since the race started last year.  I also think Governor Palin originally did the right thing in agreeing to take some small lumps by proceeding with a legislative investigation Republicans and Democrats, and much of the public asked for.    </p>
<p>But unfortunately Alaska is the bull’s eye in a national presidential race today.  When told by the McCain folks that she needed to change her position, she did, as a loyal running mate.  I understand that.</p>
<p>As an Alaskan I’m not really angry at our Governor for this mess.  I do blame John McCain for the ugliness he’s brought to our state this week.   His folks have come to my small state to attack my friends, and people I respect, for political gain.  In my book, that’s not OK.  We all mess up time to time.  But this crosses the line.  </p>
<p> In small states, like small towns, people who act like the McCain folks apologize.  Until that happens, I’ll keep defending 3 public servants who deserve better.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In the Washington Post, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/11/AR2008091102827.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">E.J. Dionne</a> writes an op-ed piece that captures Obama&#8217;s dilemma:</p>
<blockquote><p>The campaign is a blur of flying pieces of junk, lipstick and gutter-style attacks. John McCain&#8217;s deceptions about Baracks views and Sarah Palin&#8217;s flip-flopping suggest an unedifying scuffle over a city council seat. </p>
<p>The media bear a heavy responsibility because &#8220;balance&#8221; does not require giving equal time to truth and lies. So does McCain, who is running a disgraceful, dishonorable campaign of distraction and diversion. </p>
<p>But Obama bears responsibility, too: His task is to remind Americans that the stakes in this election are far higher than the matter of who said what and when about Palin. He isn&#8217;t doing that. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, it&#8217;s clear that Obama has lost control of this campaign. And he will not seize back the initiative with the sometimes halting, conversational and sadly reluctant sound bites he has been producing. The excitement Obama created at the beginning of the year has vanished.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the problem: Few voters know that Obama would cut the taxes of the vast majority of Americans by far more than McCain would. Few know Obama would guarantee everyone access to health care or that McCain&#8217;s health plan might endanger coverage many already have. Few know that Obama has a coherent program to create new jobs through public investment in roads, bridges, transit, and green technologies&#8230;. </p>
<p>It should not be hard for Obama to use crisp, punchy language to force the media and the voters to pay attention to the basic issue in this election: whether the country will slowly continue down a road to decline, or whether, to invoke a slogan from long ago, we can get the country moving again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Setting aside for a moment the accuracy of E.J.&#8217;s characterization of all of Obama&#8217;s positions, I would agree that Obama has lost control of the message, at least for now.</p>
<p>McCain-Palin are fighting like pitbulls. Palin is the bait, the lure; the real pit bull is McCain, trying to shred Obama in anyway he can: Pull him off message, take away his luster. So far it has worked.</p>
<p>And where is Biden? Maybe he is whispering something somewhere in the wings.  Biden certainly is not in the fray, at least as far as the national media are concerned. Media spotlight is the name of the game.</p>
<p>Perhaps Biden should step down, realizing that right now he is adding nothing to the mud fight and let Hillary take his place. Right now, Biden is a lost cause, chosen because he brought international expertise to the ticket, chosen to counter Obama&#8217;s presumed inexperience.</p>
<p>Now that would be a counter to the McCain-Palin nonsense. Suddenly the whole field shifts; there is a new game. Palin versus Hillary. Let&#8217;s talk about who is qualified to do what.</p>
<p>While I understand the problems involved in such a change&#8211;how does Biden bow out, for example&#8211;, I am  serious about my suggestion.</p>
<p>Sorry, E.J., no amount of &#8220;crisp, punchy language&#8221; can compete with lipstick on a pig.</p>
<p>In a campaign like this, do the unexpected. Change the script.</p>
<p>Let Hillary answer the silly charges; she has far more visibility than Biden. She will be heard. She will get attention. Let Obama be on message. And let the far-right howl and show their real colors, as they desperately re-write their playbook.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>McCain <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/09/mccain-ad-obamas-lone-edu_n_125205.html">approves</a> an ad claiming Obama wants comprehensive sex education for kindergarteners, i.e., teaching toddlers &#8220;about sex before they can learn to read.&#8221; This is gutter politics.</p>
<p>Now we come to the &#8220;pig outrage.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had a heated debate with a good friend of mine&#8211;intelligent, well informed&#8211; who claimed absolutely that Obama had so slurred Palin. I asked for the link. &#8220;Google it,&#8221; was the reply. Finally, I found it. I listened.</p>
<p>Well, I can listen as well as the next guy. More importantly, I can parse sentences better than most. I know all about subjects, verbs, and objects. I know also how to understand comparisons.</p>
<p>Well, I found the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPd4yk0x-eg">link</a>&#8211;finally.</p>
<p>Obama says McCain&#8217;s policies are identical to Bush&#8217;s&#8211;and concludes by saying: You can put lipstick on a pig (Bush&#8217;s policies), but it is still a pig.</p>
<p>And then we have the McCain and Palin outrage, all because Palin had described herself as a bulldog with lipstick&#8230;.too much. McCain, the white knight, heroically runs to rescue.</p>
<p>Curiously, the Canadian press understood what was going on&#8211;and reported it accurately. It knew exactly what Obama had said. It knew exactly how it had been twisted.</p>
<p>All of this may win elections. And maybe there is an argument that McCain and Palin are playing a good game of hardball. But who wants to slide into a home plate that looks like a pigsty?</p>
<p>There are real issues out there, as I have noted time and time again. Does anyone care about America?</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/roubini-monitor/253549/the_wefs_financial_development_report_and_index_why_is_the_us_ranked_1_in_spite_of_its_serious_financial_instability_and_crisis">Nouriel&#8217;s blog</a>, here is a comment from London Banker, a writer and commentator for the blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was briefed on the proposed US financial reforms which will be shoved through with minimal review. Short version is that the Fed wins an explicit &#8220;financial stability&#8221; role which gives it powers and secrecy to do pretty well whatever Tim Geithner chooses to do for his capitalist crony clientele. The role will include comprehensive, global data collection which will give the Fed visibility of all open positions. In the wrong hands, this insight could be used to selectively induce volatility and margin calls which would selectively hurt some and advantage others. That could help the Fed&#8217;s friends over time.</p>
<p>The FDIC will be stripped of financial supervision and prudential intervention powers in favour of the Fed. That makes the Fed totally unreviewable and unchallenged by other authority in the USA.</p>
<p>Additionally, the SEC will be forcibly reformed to be more like the CFTC &#8211; a service entity for the interests of those who pay good money for bad regulators. Instead of fixed rules, SEC regulation will become &#8220;principles based&#8221; which will mean that no one is ever held accountable for breaking the law unless they have done something to break the code of omerta and anger their peers.</p>
<p>Federal law and regulation will pre-empt all state laws, and states attorney generals will be stripped of authority to investigate or sue. That means no more inconvenient Elliot Spitzers to get in the way of Wall Street excess.</p>
<p>This may not meet Professor Roubini&#8217;s recommendations, but the deal is going through with little review so far because the cries for reform are only going to be met with this one pre-agreed proposal. After all, who in Washington or Wall Street would ever suggest that Geithner, Bernanke and Paulson didn&#8217;t have the best interests of American and global investors at heart? </p></blockquote>
<p>And, from the <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-09/12/content_7020656.htm">China Daily</a>:<br />
<blockquote>China, which holds a fifth of its currency reserves in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt, may cut the portion held in US dollars, according to China International Capital Corp (CICC), one of the nation&#8217;s biggest investment banks.</p>
<p>The US government this week seized control of the two mortgage-finance companies, which account for almost half of the home-loan market in the world&#8217;s biggest economy, to prevent defaults from crippling them. China holds up to $400 billion in the two firms&#8217; debt, CICC Chief Economist Ha Jiming said in a report Thursday.<br />&#8220;The crisis has made Chinese officials realize it&#8217;s a bad idea to put all their eggs in one basket,&#8221; wrote Hong Kong-based Ha. &#8220;This will likely lead to greater diversification of foreign exchange reserve investments.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>China held $447.5 billion of US agency bonds as of June 2008, according to the CICC calculations using disclosures by the US Treasury. It is likely to reduce the portion of reserves in dollar assets from the current 60 percent by purchasing more non-dollar assets with new reserves, he said.</i></p>
<p>Countries in Asia have stockpiled foreign exchange reserves since the 1997-98 financial crisis to act as a cushion against a run on their exchange rates. That in turn has increased pressure on policymakers to ensure higher returns from more than $4 trillion in assets.</p>
<p>China will expand its investments in corporate bonds and equities, according to Ha. Treasury and agency bonds account for 50 percent and 40 percent of total dollar assets held by the central bank, he wrote.<br />[Italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>In a year&#8217;s turning, we may well not recognize the new emerging world order. The fall of Fannie and Freddie has set in play falling dominoes whose ultimate pattern is still not clear. Will China pull back from supporting U.S. debt? Will others follow suit?</p>
<p>Some have argued that China simply cannot disengage; the price for them is too high.</p>
<p>To that I answer: The present arrangement cannot continue. It will and must change. We have been joined at the hip like Siamese twins: One falls; the other falls.</p>
<p>But doctors have been assembled, both at home and abroad. The delicate severing operation may be about to begin.</p>
<p>China will protect its interest. And is London Banker correct about whose interests in the states will be protected?</p>
<p>In every system there is a dynamic. Look closely at the gears and you will see its direction. Globalization as it has been structured has its dynamic as well. China as exporter and saver: America as consumer and debtor. There have been winners&#8211;and rest assured, they will do their best to protect their gains.</p>
<p>We, we the bit players, are like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Tom Stoppard&#8217;s marvelous play. Around us move the great ones, making plans we cannot see, arranging the world according to their needs. They tell us all is well, proceeding as planned. A glorious future awaits us; we simply have to obey directives. Like blind pawns, we are moved around the board.</p>
<p>Well, I for one, am not convinced all this will end happily&#8230;at least not for us.</p>

                                <p>Let us assume:
<ol>
<li>That <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/the-us-equity-p.html">there is an equity premium</a> (<s>[PDF]</s> UPDATE: Link modified to Brad De Long posting in which the PDF is embedded.  Hat tip: <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/lets-play-game-connect-dots.html#719787">Don Lloyd in comments</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>That the equity premium can be derived from a linear relationship (y = ax(1) + bx(2) + &#8230;.) of the most significant variables.
</li>
<li>That equity premia are, to some not-insignificant extent, <a href="http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/economic_research/economic_quarterly/pdfs/winter2008/hatchondo.pdf">based on Wealth Inequality</a> [PDF].
</li>
<li>That one of the primary variables contributing to the premium is the reliability and quality of the information provided</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the above, should we expect the imminent weakening of U.S. accounting rules, discussed <a href="http://profalbrecht.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/take-this-mr-cox/">here</a> and <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/the-rush-to-international-accounting/">here</a>,  to produce a higher equity premium?*</p>
<p>If so, there are two possibilities. Either,
<ol>
<li>the firms are perceived to have a higher present value, despite the change being one of accounting, not business flows or</p>
</li>
<li>the stock prices decline in the face of greater uncertainty, leading to an increase in the premium due to a lowering of the price.</li>
</ol>
<p>My instinctive answer—which I can probably be convinced is wrong, but it would take some effort**—is that the second would be the result.  Leaving only one question:</p>
<p>Why does Christopher Cox (R-CA) hate the Securities Markets?</p>
<p>*Following from [3] above, we can assume that greater information tends to result in more optimal investment practices, and therefore a lower equity premium.</p>
<p>**The argument would have to show that the loosening of accounting practices will result in improvements to the company&#8217;s business processes that would not otherwise occur.</p>
