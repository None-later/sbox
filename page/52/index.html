<p> Tax Relief for Victims of Sandy</p>
<p> The IRS released several bulletins this week providing relief for victims of Hurricane Sandy.<br /><a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Provides-Tax-Relief-to-Victims-of-Hurricane-Sandy;-Return-Filing-and-Tax-Payment-Deadline-Extended-to-Feb.-1,-2013">IR-2012-83</a> extends the return filing and tax payment deadline to Feb. 1, 2013 for hurricane  victims in Connecticut (Fairfield, Middlesex, New Haven, and New London Counties; the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and the Mohegan Tribal Nationa within New London County), New Jersey (Atlantic, Bergen, Cape May, Essex, Hudson, MIddlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Somerset, and Union) and New York (Bronx, Kings, Nassau, New York, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester).  The New Jersey relief starts with the Oct. 26 onset of the storm, while the Connecticut and New York relief start Oct. 27.  The release notes that the relief may be extended to taxpayers in other locations &#8220;based on additional damage assessments by FEMA. </p>
<p>The tax relief postpones various tax filing and payment deadlines that occurred starting in late October. As a result, affected individuals and businesses will have until Feb. 1, 2013 to file these returns and pay any taxes due. This includes the fourth quarter individual estimated tax payment, normally due Jan. 15, 2013. It also includes payroll and excise tax returns and accompanying payments for the third and fourth quarters, normally due on Oct. 31, 2012 and Jan. 31, 2013 respectively. It also applies to tax-exempt organizations required to file Form 990 series returns with an original or extended deadline falling during this period. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Penalties and interest that would otherwise apply will not apply, and taxpayers don&#8217;t have to apply for this basic filing extension.  Failure-to-deposit penalties for deposites due when Sandy struck or later are waived if the deposits are made by Nov. 26, 2012. Details on this are available at <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&#038;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTIxMTA3LjExODcxODUxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDEyMTEwNy4xMTg3MTg1MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MjQzNzE0JmVtYWlsaWQ9bGJlYWxlQHdheW5lLmVkdSZ1c2VyaWQ9bGJlYWxlQHdheW5lLmVkdSZmbD0mZXh0cmE9TXVsdGl2YXJpYXRlSWQ9JiYm&#038;&#038;&#038;114&#038;&#038;&#038;http://www.irs.gov/uac/Tax-Relief-in-Disaster-Situations">disaster relief</a>.   </p>
<p>The IRS also noted that it will work with taxpayers who don&#8217;t live in the designated areas &#8220;but whose books, records or tax professional are located in the areas affected by Hurricane Sandy.&#8221;  Those taxpayers do need to contact the IRS to claim the relief.  The number to call is 866-562-5227.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Hurricane-Sandy-Qualified-Treatment-of-Payments">IR-2012-84</a> alerts employers and others that qualified disaster relief payments made by an employer or other person in respect of damage from Hurricane Sandy (which has been designated a &#8220;qualified disaster&#8221;) can be excludible from taxable income and that &#8220;employer-sp9onsored private foundations may provide disaster relief to employee-victims in areas affected by the hurricane without affecting their tax-exempt status.<br />Qualified disaster relief payments include amounts to cover necessary personal, family, living or funeral expenses that were not covered by insurance. They also include expenses to repair or rehabilitate personal residences or repair or replace the contents to the extent that they were not covered by insurance.<br /><a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Treasury-and-IRS-Expand-Availability-of-Housing-for-Hurricane-Sandy-Victims">IR-2012-86</a>  expands availability of housing for victims of Hurricane Sandy by temporarily waiving the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-Income_Housing_Tax_Credit">low-income housing tax credit</a> rules that prohibit owners of low-income housing from providing housing to Sandy victims who do not qualify as low-income.</p>
<p>Other assistance through FEMA may be available:<br />Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster. FEMA has also approved Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) in New York and New Jersey for eligible disaster survivors who have a continuing need for shelter because they are unable to return to their homes for an extended period of time. Individuals and business owners who sustained losses can apply for assistance from FEMA by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) via mobile device at m.fema.gov, or online at <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&#038;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTIxMTA3LjExODcyNjIxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDEyMTEwNy4xMTg3MjYyMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MjQzNzYwJmVtYWlsaWQ9bGJlYWxlQHdheW5lLmVkdSZ1c2VyaWQ9bGJlYWxlQHdheW5lLmVkdSZmbD0mZXh0cmE9TXVsdGl2YXJpYXRlSWQ9JiYm&#038;&#038;&#038;124&#038;&#038;&#038;http://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=http://www.disasterassistance.gov/">http://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=http://www.disasterassistance.gov/</a></p>

<p>Will the Reign of Witches end January 1st?<br />(hat tip to Maggie Mahar at Health Beat blog)<br />
<blockquote>A little patience,&#8221; Jefferson wrote, &#8220;and we shall see the reign of witches pass over, their spells dissolved, and the people recovering their true sight, restoring their government to its true principles. It is true, that in the meantime, we are suffering deeply in spirit, and incurring the horrors of a war, and long oppressions of enormous public debt. &#8230; If the game runs sometimes against us at home, we must have patience till luck turns, and then we shall have an opportunity of winning back the principles we have lost. For this is a game where principles are the stake.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thomas Jefferson in writing to John Taylor after discussing Mr. Martin&#8217;s patent.</p>
<p>Jefferson complains of President Adams, the Federalists, and the Sedition Act which was used to quiet dissent and criticism. Our present situation allows a Republican minority led by their leaders John Boehner and Mitch McConnell to hold the nation hostage to the terror of cuts in domestic programs and defense in January after failing to compromise with the President on tax increases and spending cuts. In answer to the obstructionists, what if the second term President Barack Obama let the cards fall where they may and the cuts happen? Peter Orszag suggests it may not be so terrible to allow the nation to temporarily drive off the fiscal cliff to break the backs of the Republican party whose only weapon is to hold hostage the nation’s economy. Perhaps the newly elected president could have a plan to bring to an end the obstructionism of the Republicans whose sole goal was to keep Obama from being re-elected.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Jonathan Chait suggests there may be such a plan to end the reign of witches.  November 7th</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Obama does have a plan to break the legislative impasse and settle the long-term struggle over the scope of government. It does not rest on the GOP’s coming to its senses and thinking of the national good. The plan is the very opposite of naïve. And he can put it into effect even more quickly than Romney could enact his own plan. Here is how it will happen. On the morning of November 7, a reelected President Obama will do … nothing. For the next 53 days, nothing. And then, on January 1, 2013, we will all awake to a different, substantially more liberal country. The Bush tax cuts will have disappeared, restoring Clinton-era tax rates and flooding government coffers with revenue to fund its current operations for years to come. The military will be facing dire budget cuts that shake the military-industrial complex to its core. It will be a real-world approximation of the old liberal bumper-sticker fantasy in which schools have all the money they require and the Pentagon needs to hold a bake sale.</p></blockquote>
<p>Allow the program cuts to take place, the tax breaks to end, and place the Republicans in their own predicament. He could then go back and restore the middle lower income tax breaks and domestic program funding. What Republican will deny a tax cut to its primary constituency and the restoration of funds to the third rail of Social Security and Medicare?  Medicaid the program of choice for most of the middle income in going into Nursing Home care would not be far behind. Having opposed any compromise over the last two years with the objective of denying President Obama the presidency in 2012, the Republicans may have spent their powder in opposition and also in flexibility to compromise and in turn becoming a hostage to their own divisiveness. Lobbyists and executives are already pushing the Republicans to seek an agreement on tax increases and spending cuts. McCain and Lindsay have signed a letter calling for a bipartisan agreement to head off cuts to the military and defense contractors. Twixt and between . . .</p>
<p>Chait posits there is not an immediate need for a bipartisan agreement to head off the Thelma and Louise driving off the deficit precipice action of the US. With the resulting increase in taxes, revenues will swell and eventually lead to a deficit reduction allowing it to decrease to 1% of the economy and stabilize through 2022. All Obama has to do is wait and restore the programs he wishes after January 1st 2013. Of course, this begs another question.</p>
<p>Former 2008 Democrat transition lead John Podesta “does not envision Obama playing chicken with the Republicans even though the President comes off an election victory and holds the Republicans in a tight space.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/us/politics/obama-second-term-has-immediate-challenges.html%20pagewanted=all&#038;_r=0%20Question%20for%20the%20Victor;%20How%20Far%20Do%20You%20Push?">Question for the Victor; How Far Do You Push?</a></p>
<p>I guess my question is, which Obama will emerge? One who has learned bipartisanship with this crop of Republicans will not work or the Obama who will go down in history as one of the weakest presidents ever who appeases the Republicans with cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to gain tax increases. During his campaigning, not much was heard on the domestic issues from the incumbent President until late in the campaign leaving a gap in what his positions truly were with regard to immigration, Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, etc. creating tension amongst his followers.<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Obama seemed to address this tension in the closing speeches of his campaign. ‘I want to see more cooperation in Washington,’ he said in Mentor, Ohio. ‘But if the price of peace in Washington means slashing student aid, reversing his health care program or cutting people from Medicaid’ he added, ‘that’s not a price I’ll pay.’</p></blockquote>
<p>The next 53 days will tell us which President has taken office in the second term.</p>

                                <div>Three writers point to the need to maintain energy and attention to the Obama Grand Bargain.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Mark Weisbrot at The Guardian writes on <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/07/barack-obama-economic-populism-carries-day">Barack Obama&#8217;s carefully crafted economic populism carries the day</a>:</div>

<blockquote><p>The media are a huge factor in most elections in the US, and outside of Fox News and the rightwing press, most of the major news outlets were more sympathetic to Obama than to Romney. They still helped Romney quite a bit, however, especially with swing voters, with <a href="http://www.cepr.net/beat-the-press/">poor reporting on key economic issues</a>. Most Americans didn&#8217;t know that the federal stimulus had <a href="http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2010/wp10-17bk.pdf">created an estimated 3m jobs</a>; in fact, they didn&#8217;t even distinguish the stimulus from the unpopular federal bank bailout. They didn&#8217;t understand <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-&#038;-columns/op-eds-&#038;-columns/obama-health-care-reform-is-a-step-forward-hopefully-toward-medicare-for-all">the benefits that people would derive</a> from Obama&#8217;s healthcare legislation. They didn&#8217;t know that they&#8217;d had their taxes cut under Obama. And millions believed the hype that federal deficit spending and the US public debt were major problems. (For the record, the US currently <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43288">pays less than 1% of GDP in net interest</a> annually on the federal debt – less than it has paid during the past 60 years.)<br />The confusion on economic issues was probably <a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/2364/very-important-registered-voters-issues-priorities-economy-jobs-terrorism-immigration-partisans-deficit-smaller-government-energy-obama-romney-reduce-best-way-swing-medicare">the most important influence</a> on swing voters, who supported Romney against their own economic interests, thinking that the economy might improve if he were elected. For this, and other misunderstandings, we can thank the major media, although we should also include the public relations blunders made by the Obama team. Perhaps the biggest strategic error was<a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-&#038;-columns/op-eds-&#038;-columns/the-economics-of-social-security-in-the-presidential-race">President Obama&#8217;s refusal</a> to go after <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/issues/social-security">Romney&#8217;s proposal to cut social security</a>, thereby losing the majority of senior citizens&#8217; votes (a big vote in swing states like Virginia and Florida), which he could potentially have won by defending America&#8217;s most popular anti-poverty program.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Obama&#8217;s silence on social security is a bad omen for the future of his second administration, when – facing almost immediately the &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; – political, media, and business leaders will be <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83197.html">pressing for a &#8220;grand bargain&#8221;</a> on budget issues that will screw the vast majority of Americans. It will take a lot of grassroots pressure to prevent the worst outcomes: likewise, to get us out of Afghanistan and to prevent another disastrous war, this time with Iran. Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-naiman/five-specific-questions-j_b_2020214.html">foreign policy has been mostly atrocious</a>and the never-ending <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/plan-for-hunting-terrorists-signals-us-intends-to-keep-adding-names-to-kill-lists/2012/10/23/4789b2ae-18b3-11e2-a55c-39408fbe6a4b_story.html">&#8220;war on terror&#8221; continues to expand</a>, while most Americans&#8217; living standards have been declining.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=31&#038;Itemid=74&#038;jumival=9057">Bill Black interview</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Bill BLACK: Yes. The president came into office talking about the possibility of this grand bargain—more than the possibility; this desire reach it. And then he tried to reach it in budget discussions with the Republicans. They refused.</p>
<p>He just a few days ago went and met with the editorial board of <i>The Des Moines Register</i>, the leading newspaper out in that portion of Iowa, and he had a discussion off the record, and emphasized that because it was off the record he could be more blunt, and said that his first course of business, and one that he believed he could get done very quickly should he be reelected, would be to strike a grand bargain. And he described the grand bargain, and there would be $2 in budget cuts for every dollar in increased taxes.<br /> So this grand bargain is: we will weight this much more heavily towards killing social programs, or at least cutting them back significantly and raising taxes on the rich.</p>
<p>Now, that&#8217;s got most of the attention from progressives, but note two other things that he was saying. One, he&#8217;s talking about austerity. He&#8217;s talking about following exactly the kind of model that Europe has followed that put them gratuitously back into recession, and indeed into a Great Depression. And as we&#8217;re doing this interview, it has just come out that European unemployment reached a new high in September, which is the latest month that they had data for. So this has cost millions of Europeans their jobs, and it&#8217;s Great Depression levels of unemployment in Spain and Greece, and growing in many other nations. So this is insane to follow this strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/series/glenn-greenwald-security-liberty">Glenn Greenwald at The Guardian</a>  writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>So the delirium of liberals this morning is understandable: the night could scarcely have gone better for them. By all rights, they should expect to be a more powerful force in Washington. But what are they going to get from it? Will they wield more political power? Will their political values and agenda command more respect? Unless the disempowering pattern into which they have voluntarily locked themselves changes, the answer to those questions is almost certainly &#8220;no&#8221;.<br />Consider the very first controversial issue Obama is likely to manage, even before the glow of his victory dims, literally within the next couple of weeks. It is widely expected &#8211; <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83197.html">including by liberals</a> &#8211; that Obama intends (again) to pursue a so-called &#8220;Grand Bargain&#8221; with the GOP: a deficit- and debt-cutting agreement whereby the GOP agrees to some very modest tax increases on the rich in exchange for substantial cuts to entitlement programs such as social security and Medicare, the crown legislative jewels of American liberalism.</p>
<p>Indeed, Obama <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-debt-talks-obama-offers-social-security-cuts/2011/07/06/gIQA2sFO1H_story.html">already sought</a> in his <a href="http://americablog.com/2012/03/obama-wanted-cuts-to-social-security-and-medicare-during-failed-grand-bargain-talks.html">first term</a> to implement <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/11/obama-medicare-eligibility-age_n_894833.html">sizable cuts</a> to those programs, but liberals were saved only by GOP recalcitrance to compromise on taxes. In light of their drubbing last night, they are likely to be marginally if not substantially more flexible, which means that such a deal is more possible than ever. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>By Jeff McCord of <a href="http://www.the-investor-advocate.com/"><i>The Investor Advocate</i></a></p>
<p>USA: History’s Largest Free Port for Financial Freebooters?</p>
<p>The term “freebooter,” derived from the Dutch vrijbuiter, means one who openly steals property. Once freebooters sailed the coasts of the Carolinas, Florida and Caribbean isles from free ports such as Port Royal, Jamaica, taking what they wished with little or no consequences because Jamaican Colonial authorities granted them immunity.</p>
<p>Today, a federal appeals court may determine if the United States has become the largest such free port for swindlers in modern history. At issue is the Supreme Court’s controversial 2010 decision (Morrison v. National Australia Bank), that provides immunity from investor accountability to off-shore shysters preying on Americans as well as on-shore fraudsters plundering foreigners as long as the fraudulent transactions take place outside the USA or involve securities listed overseas. Many experts believe Morrison also provides immunity from SEC civil and federal criminal actions.</p>
<p>“Political” High Court Decision to Curtail Investor Rights May Also Free Criminals<br />
<blockquote>With Morrison, the Supreme Court “cavalierly overturned 40 years of precedent,” says former SEC commissioner and Brooklyn Law professor Robert S. Karmel. She says there was no compelling reason for the Supreme Court to even hear the case and onlyu did so to “further its campaign to limit [investor fraud] class actions to the extent possible”</p></blockquote>
<p>See <a href="http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=1202560166548&#038;Should_Morrison_Be_Overturned&#038;slreturn=20120923095758">Justce Antonin Scalia’s majority [Morrison] opinion is blatantly political&#8230;NY law journal</a></p>
<p>Justice Scalia’s majority opinion may also be so broadly worded that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit may be compelled to conclude that no prosecution &#8212; civil or criminal &#8212; of wrongdoers peddling foreign securities is possible within the United States. Among other unfortunate and unforeseeable consequences, such a ruling would overturn the criminal convictions of two flamboyant “old school” fraudsters: Alberto Vilar, who falsely claimed to be a Castro-fleeing Cuban émigré but did have an investment operation in Panama (an old pirate haunt); and, Ross Mandell, a broker of questionable repute who resides in Boca Raton (the new Port Royal?).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Flamboyant Convicted Swindlers May Be Off the Hook</p>
<p>First, let’s meet Ross H. Mandell, a Boca domiciled broker with a regulatory challenged past – he was suspended from trading on the New York Stock Exchange &#8212; and million dollar life-style, the New York Times reported. A unanimous federal jury convicted him of running an old-fashioned “boiler room” operation in Florida to defraud mostly British investors by using fraudulent sales pitches to flog questionable stocks on a London exchange. Although, he allegedly defrauded Americans as well, his lawyers contend the statute of limitations had run out on those crimes. <br />New York Times columnist Floyd Norris recently described Mr. Mandell:<br />
<blockquote>“The government says the money he gained from defrauding investors paid for ‘first-class flights, five-star hotel suites, expensive meals, adult entertainment and personal spending,’ even though his firm was losing money. It says some of the money was used for ‘work done on Mandell’s penthouse apartment at Trump U.N. Plaza’ in Manhattan.”</p></blockquote>
<p>See: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/business/us-justice-vs-foreign-fraud.html?_r=1">NYT&#8230;Us justce vs. foriegn fraud</a></p>
<p>Let’s now consider the case of Mr. Alberto Vilar, a high-profile broker-dealer who was found guilty in federal court of stealing millions of customers’ funds. Listed by Forbes in 2005 as among the 400 wealthiest men in America, Mr. Vilar had assets believed to total nearly $1 billion. He was an opera lover and a very generous, well-known patron. Despite his love of the performance art, Mr. Vilar reportedly embezzled $2 million from star tenor Placido Domingo, in an incident unrelated to his securities conviction. See: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/02/13/060213fa_fact_stewart">New Yorker</a></p>
<p>In an appeal citing Morrison, Mr. Vilar’s attorneys say he should be released from incarceration at a federal facility and his conviction overturned because the transactions and investments at issue were allegedly structured at the defendant’s Panamanian registered broker-dealer, rather than within the United States. In a sign some believe signals that the federal appeals court may agree, Mr. Vilar was ordered released on bail pending the appellate decision. See: <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-02/amerindo-cofounders-vilar-and-tanaka%20win-release-on-bail.html">Bloomberg&#8230;amerindo cofounders vilar and tanaka-wi release-on-bail</a></p>
<p>Foreign-Based Frauds of Petty Criminals and Too-Big to Fail Banks</p>
<p>These are simply two recent fraud cases that may be turned upside down by Morrison. And, although the alleged crimes were egregious, these were relatively small scale transgressions when measured against the off-shore connivances of too-big-to-fail banks that can cause multi-billion dollar investor losses. Think Goldman Sachs and its’ allegedly fraudulent sub-prime mortgage derived collateralized debt obligations structured in London, but sold to U.S. investors. </p>
<p>Whether petty criminals or clever multi-national corporate schemers, such wrongdoers may have been dealt a “get out of jail free” card by the Supreme Court. They have also been immunized from accountability to their victims.<br />Congress Should Take Action before Jolly Roger flies beside Stars and Stripes<br />Many agree with former SEC commissioner Karmel (cited above) that it is time for Congress to overturn Morrison. Salvator J. Graziano, Esq, a partner at Bernstein Litowitz Berger &#038; Grossman, LLP, president of the National Association of Shareholder and Commercial Attorneys and former Assistant District Attorney for Manhattan agrees. He summed-up the wider repercussions of Morrison in calling for Congress to take action: </p>
<blockquote><p>“With Morrison, the Supreme Court unwittingly has allowed the U.S. to become a safe haven for fraud so long as the securities at issue are listed abroad. On behalf of investors at home and abroad, we ask Congress to over-turn the unfortunate Morrison decision by restoring the rights of action of defrauded investors and clarifying the authority of federal regulators and the Department of Justice.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Congress should act before the Jolly Roger flies beside the Stars and Stripes over Wall Street and Boca Raton.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>It is now clear that the calculations Nate Silver made just before the election were a better guide to what was about to happen than Joe Scarborough&#8217;s gut or the voices in Peggy Noonan&#8217;s head.  This is not a high bar to clear.  Many other poll aggregators made similar predictions.</p>
<p>However, Silver&#8217;s performance this year has been amazing (again).  It isn&#8217;t because the networks still haven&#8217;t decided if his expected Obama electoral votes forecast was too high or too low (they will when they call Florida) its that they haven&#8217;t yet concluded that the forecasts he made in July were noticeably different from the outcome (they will when they finally call Florida for Obama). </p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cn5-u6NwBsI/UJp-mPHeEuI/AAAAAAAAAU4/M2ocZUKX100/s1600/silverstandard.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="397" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cn5-u6NwBsI/UJp-mPHeEuI/AAAAAAAAAU4/M2ocZUKX100/s400/silverstandard.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Silver stresses that he thinks it is important to make predictions about the future &#8212; that predicting on Monday what will happen Tuesday is of no use for people trying to decide what to do in July (say how aggressively to use tax shelters July 2012 or whether to invest in bottled water, canned food and ammunition July 2004).</p>
<p>The fact that he got it right the day before the end is, well better than cable babbler standard anyway.  The fact that he got it right without having to constantly massively change his forecasts due to new information is much more impressive. </p>
<p>Sticking to a prediction is always possible if one is stubborn (or strategically boastful).  Getting it right in the end is possible if tons of information are available at the end.  To stick to a prediction of the distant future and get it right one must have precognition.  To make predictions which change as little as Silver&#8217;s did and get it right one must be on to something.</p>

(As of yesterday—remember, remember, the Fifth of November—we were the town in Essex County that had the least restored houses.) A lot of progress today, with teams from Texas and Florida among those called in (which presumably left the NJ teams to deal with the major issues down by the shore).</p>
<p>By a fluke of (mis)transcription, my work number is getting calls from the Huntington (NY) School District.  Huntington is (per Google Maps) fifty-six (56) miles away, around the middle of Lon Gisland.</p>
<p>One of the things that has been happening is that the towns are in parallel: my childrens’s schools have both been closed since last Monday.  So has the Huntington School District. For the past two days, on two separate telephones, I have gotten a call saying, in short, “We have no power. No school tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Today, the calls were different.</p>
<p>For here, the grade school is open tomorrow.  For the middle school, power is still not restored, but alternatives have been found.</p>
<p>For Huntington, the message went roughly like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Power has now been restored to the school.  However, we are now anticipating that the high winds from tomorrow’s Nor’easter will reach our area before the scheduled dismissal time tomorrow.  Given the danger from trees and power lines that have not yet been repaired from Sandy, we are going to remain closed tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jersey Jazzman asked if his annual evaluation would include a “<a href="http://jerseyjazzman.blogspot.com/2012/10/will-my-teacher-rating-have-sandy.html">Sandy variable</a>.”  All the talk from Lon Gislanders has been about how Sandy impacted the South Shore and how tomorrow’s Nor’easter will impact the North Shore.</p>
<p>Some areas of the Northeast were less affected.  Some are recovering.  And some—such as the middle of Lon Gisland—are getting the worst of both worlds.</p>
<p>Just to relate this to finance:  I really wouldn’t go long any insurance companies (or even reinsurance companies) just yet.</p>

<blockquote><p>A remarkably important and persuasive paper that calls into question the need for “reforming” Medicare has not gotten the attention it warrants. “<a href="http://www.bancaditalia.it/studiricerche/convegni/atti/fiscal_sustainability/session_3/Follette%20Sheiner.pdf">An Examination of Health-Spending Growth In The United States: Past Trends And Future Prospects</a>” (hat tip nathan) by Glenn Follette and Louise Sheiner looks at the model used by the Congressional Budgetary Office to estimate long term health care cost increases. Bear in mind that this model is THE driver of virtually all forecasts of future budget deficits.<br />This paper, although written in typically anodyne economese, is devastating in the range and nature of its criticisms.</p></blockquote>
<p>The election for Senator in MA is close and takes a lot of time, so discussion of this topic has received short shrift till later, but reponses are in the works.  I have taken the liberty of lifting comments from that thread at <i>Naked Capitalism</i> from run75441, Yves, and reader river.</p>

After all of us experiencing this exact same thing play itself out in the housing market, I can only imagine how it would play itself out in healthcare. For the last few years, most of my raises have gone to healthcare cost increases, and I would expect that to continue, but after a while, we would switch to a catestrophic insurance program and just not use the services that they are providing. As the costs keep going up, more and more people would stop getting any insurance. Bankrupcies, and cost pressures on medical facilities will start to hit the practitioners (if all of the antelopes are starving, the lions will soon starve themselves).<br /><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/11/fed-budgetary-experts-demolish-cbo-health-cost-model-the-lynchpin-of-budget-hysteria.html?replytocom=890411#respond">Reply</a>

The goal is to get both down to 1% through a series of cost initiatives led by Medicare. Obama has pledged to allow Medicare to begin negotiating healthcare industry services.<br />The MLR was put in place to control the amount of premiums spent on insurance administration. Within the MLR are risk factors based upon the youngest and healthiest insuree, 150% for smokers (too low), and up to 300% for the elderly. There is also a maximum you will pay as a percentage of income.<br />I had a discussion today with Maggie Mahar on the growing costs and the attached article. I am sure she would not mind my posting some of her thoughts:<br />“It seems to me that any attempt to forecast that far out is nuts. Wall Street analysts don’t try to predict a corporation’s finance out more than 3 years– maybe 5– and that’s just one corporations.<br />They’re talking about healthcare spending– a huge chunk of the economy.They also assume that the aging of America means higher spending.<br />A number of countries in Europe that have populations that are significantly older than ours have shown that just isn’t true. (I’m thinking of Germany &#038; Sweden in particular).<br />We’ve always been somewhat hysterical about “What will happen when the Baby Boomers Grow Old!!” We’ll handle it because we have to.<br />We already know that 1/3 of Medicare dollars are wasted. Cut even 2/3 of that waste, and problem solved. Getting away from fee for service, more efficient systems, refusing to pay for preventable errors, reducing what medicare pays for services we know are not terribly effective; greater use of nurse practitioners, less screening, . . . etc.”</li>
