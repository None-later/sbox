<p>Liberal attacks on Social Security are the unkindest cut of all.
<p>The Center for American Progress’s Matt Miller has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/09/AR2011020903118_Comments.html">argued</a> that liberals can learn a valuable lesson from NY Governor Andrew Cuomo’s proposed budget. With his state facing a fiscal crisis, the Governor has proposed to cap growth of state spending on the Medicaid program. Miller has argued that we should follow his example and apply a similar cap to Social Security spending.</p>
<p>Briefly, New York’s Medicaid spending was slated to grow by 13%, much faster than the overall inflation rate. Governor Cuomo has proposed to ignore funding formulas and to limit growth to 6%. Miller wants liberals to follow that example by changing Social Security’s formula used to adjust benefits.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Miller rightly notices that Social Security expenditures are also projected to grow faster than inflation. Of course, some of that is due to our aging society, with more retirees to support. But funding formulas for Social Security also contribute to growth of individual benefits beyond cost of living adjustments. In other words, Social Security expenditures in real terms (after inflation) increase faster than growth of the retired population, meaning that the benefits received in the future by a retiree will be higher in real terms than they are today.</p>
<p>Here’s why. In the 1970s it was recognized that if real living standards rise over time (due to growing productivity of workers), then Social Security retirement benefits would fall behind even if they are adjusted for inflation. Suppose you retired today at age 65 and were fortunate enough to live another 25 years to the ripe old age of 90. Let us say you retire at the typical benefit of $18,000 paid to one who has earned a medium wage pre-retirement. If that benefit is adjusted every year to account for inflation, when you die in 2036 you will still be able to buy the same consumer basket in your last year of life (assuming the COLA adjustments accurately reflect inflation — something that is not really true). But over that 25-year period you will watch as the average American living standard rises relative to your own. You will become relatively impoverished.</p>
<p>Over a period that long, it is likely that living standards will have increased substantially; over the course of US history they have typically doubled each generation. You will have fallen far behind in relative terms — from a not-so-comfortable living standard ($18,000 is by no means extravagant today) to a living standard that is half as good in relative terms.</p>
<p>For comparison purposes, based on current formulas, your Social Security retirement is projected to grow in real terms from that $18,000 now to $24,000 in 2030 and to $29,000 in 2050 (should you be so lucky to live to the age of 104!). Your living standard will grow by 60% as it keeps pace with the growth of American workers’ living standards. In relative terms, you do not fall behind. If everyone else is driving flying saucers to Venetian vacations, you’ll be able to do the same.</p>

<p>There are of course two objections. First, we do not know how much living standards will rise. It will depend on growth of labor productivity. But by linking growth of Social Security benefits to real wage growth we are ensuring that no matter how much productivity grows (whether it is zero or 400 percent), seniors will get their share.</p>
<p>Second, one could argue that in absolute terms, seniors are no worse off if we limit benefit growth to cover inflation. They’ll probably still live better in America than they would in India, after all.</p>
<p>But one thing we do know is that well-being depends more on relative comparisons than on absolute terms. Relative poverty is more detrimental to one’s physical, psychological, and emotional health than is absolute poverty. At first that might sound counterintuitive, but researchers from many disciplines have consistently found this to be true. It is relative poverty that isolates an individual, that reduces her ability to participate fully in society. So while it is commonplace to note that America’s poor are rich by Indian standards, that comparison is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Miller’s justification for elimination of the real living standard adjustment is based on two fallacies.</p>
<p>First, he argues that financing growth of Social Security benefits will “crowd out” all the other liberal priorities. The federal government simply will not be able to “afford” the costs of “guaranteeing great teachers for poor children, universal preschool, repairs for America’s crumbling roads and sewer” if we let living standards of seniors rise.</p>
<p>Second, he refers to growing numbers of retired baby boomers as the cause of the problem. It is a little publicized fact that when the intergenerational warriors trot out their “unfunded entitlements” that supposedly total tens of trillions of dollars, the shortfall is entirely due to the projected deficits in the long distant future after all baby boomers are dead and buried. The projected date of Armageddon, when Social Security first starts to run deficits (that is, when its total revenues fall short of its benefit payments) changes from year-to-year as assumptions change based on recent economic performance. But typically that date is sometime in the 2040s.</p>
<p>Think about it. The babyboomers will be closing in on the century mark by then. Yes, a few of them might make it. But most of us partied way too hard in the 1960s and 1970s. Heck, we were surprised to make it to the 1980s.</p>
<p>I do not have the space to go through all the reasons why the very long-term (75 years and beyond) projections of Social Security’s finances show growing budget deficits — but it mostly comes down to implausibly pessimistic and inconsistent assumptions about economic variables. In any case, it turns out that the projected financial shortfall amounts to about 2% of GDP per year after 2040 or so. In other words, if we find a way to shift 2% more of GDP annually toward Social Security’s funding over the next 30 years, the “looming financial crisis” disappears. By the way, we achieved a greater shift than that between 1960 and the 1990s. Only an ideologue could trump that up to a crisis.</p>
<p>But forget the finances. What really matters is growth of our nation’s ability to take care of the young, the workers, and the aged. Will we be able to produce enough goods and services to provide a rising living standard to all (supplemented by imports — if the rest of the world continues to prefer to “consume” green paper money over their own output, a topic for another day)? On all plausible projections the answer is a resounding “yes”. Indeed, even the pessimistic projections made by the Social Security Trustees shows rising living standards for all even as we age as a society.</p>
<p>That makes sense. The average worker in 1965 supported more dependents (young plus old) than workers are ever projected to support again. Why is that? Elementary: the parents of baby boomers supported 3.7 kids; the flip side of an aging society is that workers today and into the future are supporting more old people but fewer kids. It’s a tradeoff. We may not like it, but the alternatives are unpleasant: euthanasia for the elderly or very much higher birthrates. Far better to accept the aging society and to continue to ramp up productivity so that we can provide for them.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is precisely that productivity growth that drives the growth of real benefits that Miller wants to cut! If we don’t get rising productivity, we don’t get rising real benefits.

<p>David Cay Johnston, former New York Times tax reporter and now a columnist at Tax Analyst&#8217;s Tax Notes, writes this week about  the way both the Obama White House and the Republican party conspire to provide every-increasing benefits through the tax system to some while stiffing the working poor.  <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/files/david-cay-johnston.-obama-and-the-gop-united-against-the-working-poor.-tn-14feb11.pdf">Download David Cay Johnston. Obama and the GOP United Against the Working Poor. TN 14Feb11</a>.</p>
<p>The beginning paragraphs make the critical points.</p>
<p>The tax compromise passed in December has been hailed everywhere as a payroll tax cut combined with an extension of the Bush tax cuts, despite the fact that it raised taxes on a third of Americans. The killing of Obama’s Making Work Pay tax credit, which the White House called the biggest middle-income tax cut ever, and the replacement of it with the Republicans’ payroll tax cut raised taxes on single workers whose wages come to $20,000 or less and married couples with less than $40,000 in wages. That’s 51 million taxpayers, the Tax Policy Center estimated.</p>
<p>[Two-thirds of the poorest quintile had a tax increase of $134 (about 1.3% of total cash income), whereas] at the top, just 1.8 percent of the top 1 percent ([those with] more than $564,600) were hit with a tax inrease.  Just 1.3 percent among the top tenth of 1 percent ([those with] more than $2 million) got a tax hike.  These best-off one in 1,000 Americans got a tax cut worth on average $45,000 each, all financed with borrowed money.</p>

<p>The more I get to know this recovery, the more I’m starting to like it.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s been rather standoffish, giving the cold shoulder to millions of unemployed Americans. And true, through much of 2010 it was maddeningly elusive, never giving us confidence that it was here to stay. But the more data I review from the second half of 2010, the more I start liking what I see. Particularly because the data suggests to me that this recovery, while not roaring, is being built on a solid foundation, and therefore has the potential to grow into something pretty meaningful as this year progresses.</p>
<p>There are four things in particular that make me guardedly happy about this recovery.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><strong>1. The manufacturing sector. </strong><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ne0uGUCxusE/TVnGz4SA6hI/AAAAAAAAAYE/WOLwDVbEtI4/s1600/manuf%2Bjobs1.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ne0uGUCxusE/TVnGz4SA6hI/AAAAAAAAAYE/WOLwDVbEtI4/s320/manuf%2Bjobs1.PNG"></a><br />I’ve spent a lot of time over the last week explaining why I am <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/lean-mean-manufacturing-machine.html">bullish on US manufacturing</a>. The manufacturing sector is too small to make a significant dent in the US’s vast unemployment problem. However, it has been the source of some net job creation (see table), and more generally is a good indicator of the competitiveness of the US economy in terms of international trade. Which brings us to&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>2. US exports. </strong><br />Exports from the US did very well in the second half of 2010, which helped to give the US economy a substantial boost toward the end of the year. Best of all, this strong export performance was driven by <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/selling-stuff-to-china.html">sales to the growing, dynamic, developing countries of the world like China</a>. That makes it likely that continued rapid growth in China and other developing countries will actually provide a noticeable boost to the US economy in 2011 and going forward. Compare this with what happened during the recovery from the previous recession. As shown in the chart below, in 2002-03 US export growth only provided a modest 0.45% boost to GDP. This time around, however, US export growth has been adding over a full percentage point to US GDP growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IvpgBH-KSzo/TVnHlGs_JQI/AAAAAAAAAYM/9X5ZJSTzh8w/s1600/recovery%2B1.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IvpgBH-KSzo/TVnHlGs_JQI/AAAAAAAAAYM/9X5ZJSTzh8w/s400/recovery%2B1.PNG"></a><br /><strong>3. Business purchases of investment goods.</strong><br />Unlike the recovery from the last recession, when businesses were extremely slow to begin purchasing new equipment and machinery, in 2010 business spending on things other than buildings grew at a healthy rate. In fact, investment spending in “equipment and software” (the “e&#038;s” in the chart above) added over a full percentage point to GDP growth through 2010. The best part of this kind of spending is that it provides a much greater boost to productivity, and thus long-term economic growth, than personal consumption spending. The fact that in 2010 far more of the growth in real GDP came from business investment (and less from residential investment) than was true during the previous recovery is a very good sign for medium and long-term economic growth in the US.</p>
<p><strong>4. Household financial retrenching. </strong><br />The biggest drag on economic growth during this recovery has been the ongoing financial rebalancing that US households have been doing by paying down debt. But while this has meant that consumption has not grown as rapidly as it might have, it also means that this recovery is not (unlike the previous one) being built on borrowed money. Household debt levels have fallen dramatically over the past two years (see the chart below), and while arguably still higher than they should be, the fact that households have been reducing their debt in a pretty determined way suggests that households will be able to increase, and sustainably increase, their spending in 2011 and beyond as incomes grow faster.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wp7S5e6nq84/TVnISlF8NlI/AAAAAAAAAYU/geat1AK9I3M/s1600/recovery%2B2.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wp7S5e6nq84/TVnISlF8NlI/AAAAAAAAAYU/geat1AK9I3M/s400/recovery%2B2.PNG"></a><br />Yes, all in all, I think there are some very nice things to like about this recovery. Now we just need it to set to creating new jobs in a serious way. But based on the strong foundations on which this recovery is being built, I think it won’t be much longer before we see meaningful falls in unemployment levels in the US.</p>
<p>I must say: after being very bearish on the US economy through all of the 2000s (and particularly during my previous stint writing for Angry Bear, 2003-06), it’s nice to finally have something hopeful to write about this surprisingly alluring recovery&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Key European CDS are starting to turn in the more northern direction again, as the German-French &#8216;pact for competitiveness&#8217; faces <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,745383,00.html">near-unanimous pushback across Europe</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ALLZu81DlW8/TVmUyM4j-XI/AAAAAAAADek/LeczhVBaunc/s1600/cds_spreads.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ALLZu81DlW8/TVmUyM4j-XI/AAAAAAAADek/LeczhVBaunc/s400/cds_spreads.JPG" border="0"></a>Credit default swaps (CDS) are a market security used by investors to buy 5-yr protection (in this case) against default (or the like). As the spread rises the implied probability of default does too. Current market values imply a 39% probability of default by the Irish sovereign (listed in legend), 20% by that of Spain, and 14% by the Italian sovereign, etc. Cash bond spreads are blowing out again, too, where Spain now must pay a 216 bps premium over Germany on a 10-yr loan (the sovereign bond). I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s not totally irrational.</p>
<p>I completely understand why these negotiations are stalling. I&#8217;m Spain &#8211; it&#8217;s not clear that Spain commented against the pact based on <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,745383,00.html">this article</a>, but I digress &#8211; why would I agree to a deal that forces more &#8216;competitive&#8217; measures, which really just means quashing indexed wage growh, reducing the government deficit, adhering to a fiscal policy rule (which, by the way should be modeled after Germany&#8217;s debt brake), and adopting a standardized tax rate? Okay, I will if you (Germany) will. Meaning, I&#8217;ll increase my competitiveness by stripping away aggregate demand if you allow prices to rise. I&#8217;m Germany &#8211; no way. (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/eurozone-rebalancing-depends-on-german.html">Please see my previous post </a>which argues that a successful transition to a more stable Eurozone depends on higher Germany inflation.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,742565-3,00.html">Der Spiegel spells it </a>out pretty succinctly in an article that is now two weeks old but still totally relevant:<br /><em><br />
<blockquote><em>Germany will only agree to additional guarantees for the euro rescue fund &#8212; as the Commission and other parties have called for &#8212; if its partners approve its competitiveness pact.<br /></em></p></blockquote>
<p></em><br />Simply put: we (Germany) will only agree to eventually bail you out if you agree to our harsh demands at that time, or you agree to our harsh demands now. You&#8217;re choice.</p>
<p>This political drama is far from over. (More exciting analysis below the jump)</p>
<p>(Dan here&#8230;Kantoos responds to Rebecca&#8230;http://kantoos.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/rebecca-wilder-on-eurozone-monetary-policy-and-german-inflation/ )<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another little fact to think about: The price to buy protection against a default by the Japanese sovereign is just 77 bps, that&#8217;s only 23 bps above that for the German sovereign. This is ironic because Germany is the premiere demander of fiscal austerity, while Japan is not (to say the least) with gross debt equal to 221% of GDP (<a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fm/2011/01/update/fmindex.htm">according to the IMF</a>) &#8211; <em>or is it</em>?</p>
<p>The table below lists common characteristics usually associated with rising CDS spreads (CDS spreads are current as of 4pm today and may vary according to pricing source): the stock of debt held by foreigners (any currency denomination) and the stock of gross public debt. The final column illustrates the ability of a country to print fiat currency that is not backed by anything but government decree.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s pretty clear: Japan and the US have very elevated government debt, but low external holdings AND can print their own money to finance liabilities (which by the way are in most part denominated in their respective currencies). Clearly markets&#8217; attach weight to this simple fact via low CDS spreads.</p>

<p>Economist James K. Galbraith attends a Pete Peterson-funded road show.
<p>The <a href="http://www.pgpf.org/Issues/Fiscal-Outlook/2010/09/28/The-Fiscal-Solutions-Tour.aspx">Fiscal Solutions Tour</a> is the latest Peter G. Peterson Foundation effort to rouse the public against deficits and the national debt — and in particular (though they manage to avoid saying so) to win support for measures that would impose drastic cuts on <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/category/social-securitys-fiscal-fitness/">Social Security</a> and Medicare. It features Robert Bixby of the Concord Coalition, former Comptroller General David Walker and the veteran economist Alice Rivlin, whose recent distinctions include serving on the Bowles-Simpson commission. They came to Austin on February 9 and (partly because Rivlin is an old friend) I went.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Mr. Bixby began by describing the public debt as “the defining issue of our time.” It is, he said, a question of “how big a debt we can have and what can we afford?” He did not explain why this is so. He did not, for instance, attempt to compare the debt to the financial crisis, to joblessness or foreclosures, nor to energy or climate change. Oddly none of those issues were actually mentioned by anyone, all evening long.</p>
<p>A notable feature of Bixby’s presentation were his charts. One of them showed clearly how the public deficit soared at the precise moment that the financial crisis struck in late 2008. The chart also shows how the Clinton surpluses had started to disappear in the recession of 2000. But Mr. Bixby seemed not to have noticed either event. Flashing this chart, he merely commented that “Congress took care” of the budget surplus. Still, the charts did show the facts — and in this respect they were the intellectual highpoint of the occasion.</p>
<p>A David Walker speech is always worth listening to with care, for Mr. Walker is a reliable and thorough enumerator of popular deficit-scare themes. Three of these in particular caught my attention on Wednesday.</p>
<p>To my surprise, Walker began on a disarming note: he acknowledged that the level of our national debt is not actually high. In relation to GDP, it is only a bit over half of what it was in 1946. And to give more credit, the number Walker used, 63 percent, refers to debt held by the public, which is the correct construct — not the 90+ percent figure for gross debt, commonly seen in press reports and in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_public_debt">comparisons</a> with other countries. The relevant number is today below where it was in the mid-1950s, and comparable to the early 1990s.</p>
<p>But Mr. Walker countered that fact with another, which I’d never heard mentioned before: in real terms he said — that is, after adjusting for inflation — per capita national debt is now twice what it was back then.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/contact/test/">Sign up for weekly ND20 highlights, mind-blowing stats, event alerts, and reading/film/music recs.</a></p>
<p>The problem is that real per capita national debt is a concept with no economic meaning or importance. (No government agency reports it, either.) Even in the private sector, debt levels matter only in relation to income and wealth: richer people can (and do) take on more debt. Real per capita national income is well over three times higher today than it was in 1946 — so how could it possibly matter that the “real per capita national debt” is twice as high?</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Walker made a comparison between the United States and Greece, with the implication being that this country might, some day soon, face that country’s interest costs. But of course this is nonsense. Greece is a small nation that has to borrow in a currency it cannot control. The United States is a large nation that pays up in a money it can print. There is no chance the markets will mistake the US for Greece, and of course they have not done so.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Walker warned that “foreign lenders… can’t dump their debt but can curb their appetite” for new US Treasury bonds. This was an oblique reference to the yellow peril. The idea, when you think about it, is that the Chinese central bank will acquire dollars — which it does when China runs an export surplus — and then fail to convert them into Treasury bonds, thereby choosing, voluntarily, to hold dollars in cash, which earns no interest, instead of as Treasury bills, which do. Mr. Walker did not try to explain why this would appeal to the Chinese.</p>
<p>Walker closed by calling for action tied to an increase in the debt ceiling; specifically for a hard cap on the debt-to-GDP ratio with “enforcement mechanisms,” which could include pro rata cuts in Social Security and Medicare benefits and tax surcharges. He did not specify whether the cap should apply to gross federal debt or only to that part of the debt held by the public (a number which the Federal Reserve can change, any time it wants, by buying or selling public debt). When pressed, in the question period, he would not even say what he thought the cap should be.</p>
<p>I waited for Ms. Rivlin to add something sensible. But she did not. Apart from some platitudes — she favors “serious tax reform” and “restructuring Medicare” — her interesting contribution was to restate Mr. Walker’s comment about “foreign lenders,” who might say “we’re not going to lend you any more money.” That this would amount to saying “we’re not going to sell you any more goods” seems — from a question-and-answer and brief exchange afterward — genuinely not to have crossed her mind.</p>
<p>The Fiscal Solutions Tour comes with a nice brochure, and even (in my case) with a flash drive containing Mr. Bixby’s powerpoints. But does Mr. Peterson think he’s getting his money’s worth? The President, in his State of the Union, mostly ignored him. The Bowles-Simpson effort (which he paid for in part) and the closely allied Rivlin-Domenici plan are fading from view. And as the House Republicans forge their own course, demanding radical spending cuts right now — for political rather than economic reasons, which they don’t even bother to explain — the tired and shabby arguments of these old deficit-worriers hardly seem connected, any more, to the battles at hand.</p>

                                <p>The NYT <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/business/economy/14dip.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;pagewanted=print">moves deeply into delusion</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The rolling real estate crash that ravaged Florida and the Southwest is delivering a new wave of distress to <em>communities once thought to be immune— economically diversified cities where the boom was relatively restrained.</em></p>
<p>In the last year, home prices in Seattle had a bigger decline than in Las Vegas. Minneapolis dropped more than Miami, and Atlanta fared worse than Phoenix. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Putting it politely, that is h*rs*sh*t. Anyone who was paying attention in the Atlanta area—or <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/10/never-blame-on-hyperoptimism-what-can.html">who has been paying attention to Georgia Bank Failures</a>—has described the Greater Metro Area&#8217;s housing prices (let alone Atlanta itself) as a bubble. (As I noted at the link above, one of our commenters, <a href="http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http%3A%2F%2Fangrybear.blogspot.com%2F2009%2F06%2Fnoted-for-record-failed-bank-edition.html&#038;title=Noted%20for%20the%20Record%2C%20Failed%20Bank%20edition%20~%20Angry%20Bear&#038;path=%2F7261484830963939755&#038;avatars=yes&#038;standalone=no&#038;scoring=yes&#038;paginate=1000&#038;backwards=no&#038;sort=date&#038;thread=yes&#038;permalink=http%3A%2F%2Fangrybear.blogspot.com%2F2009%2F06%2Fnoted-for-record-failed-bank-edition.html&#038;skin=echo&#038;smiles=no&#038;editable=yes&#038;popup-title=Echo">Nancy Ortiz, was all over this</a> in <strong><em>June of 2009</em></strong>; and the old Business Week covered it in <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/investing/wall_street_news_blog/archives/2009/10/weekend_reading.html">an article published in October of that year</a>. Does the NYT believe that local banks fail for no reason?  As Peter Carbonara wrote in the BusinessWeek piece:<br />
<blockquote>One Material Loss Review released today, for example, describes the death throes of FirstCity Bank, which had $297 million in assets and was based in Stockbridge, Georgia, a town not far southeast of Atlanta. FirstCity, like many other banks in the metro Atlanta area, partook of <em><strong>the state&#8217;s late, lamented enormous real estate boom</strong></em>, making a large number of loans to local builders. When the boom turned into a crash in 2007, those loans turned bad. The bank failed on March 20. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Minneapolis is another clear case where the locals were talking about a bubble back in late 2006/early 2007. Commenter TrickStar was <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2008/11/case-shiller-index-falls-174/#comment-128775">all over Minneapolis at Barry Ritholtz&#8217;s place it in November of 2008</a>. (Indeed, by March of 2010, the <a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/spf/CSHomePrice_Release_033056.pdf">S&#038;P/Case-Shiller Index was claiming a &#8220;recovery&#8221; for Minneapolis</a> [link is PDF]. Talk about &#8220;green shoots.&#8221;)</p>
<p>That same PDF&#038;again, from 11 months ago, using January 2010 data—discusses Seattle, which had the fifth-largest drop in housing prices during 2009. And that was over a year ago. As the Seattle Bubble blog noted, <a href="http://seattlebubble.com/blog/2010/12/28/case-shiller-seattle-home-prices-hit-new-post-peak-low/">things only got worse last year</a>.</p>
<p>SEATTLE UPDATE:  Even <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/seattles-foreseeable-housing-bust/">David Leonhardt piles on</a>.  Hint to the NYT: Institutional Memory is an Asset <em>only when used</em>.  If you need someone to run your Knowledge Management division, give me a call and we&#8217;ll talk.</p>
<p>In short, anyone who was paying attention knew that all three cities were prime examples of housing bubbles. The idea that the NYT&#8217;s best economics writer doesn&#8217;t is frightening at best.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/02/new-program-for-offshore-accounts.html"><strong>New Program for Offshore Accounts</strong></a><br />crossposted with Ataxingmatter
<p>As I mentioned in earlier posts, the IRS has released information about a new voluntary disclosure program for offshore account holders.  The last program, which closed in October 2009, provided a low penalty of 20% of the highest aggregate balance in offshore accounts for the various failure to file information returns (FBAR and others) and elimination of any risk of a 75% fraud penalty or criminal prosecution for those accepted into the program who &#8216;truthfully, timely, and completely&#8221; comply with their disclosure obligations under the initiative.  This one is only slightly harsher, with a 25% aggregate-balance penalty.  Participants would also pay a 20% accuracy-related penalty on any tax underpayments for relevant years.</p>
<p>The information is available on the IRS website under &#8220;<a href="http://www.irs.gov/compliance/enforcement/article/0,,id=205909,00.html">How to make a Voluntary Disclsure under the 2011 OVDI </a>(standing for &#8220;Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Initiative&#8221;) and in a new Q/A on the website, <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/international/article/0,,id=235699,00.html">2011 OVCI frequently asked questions and answers</a>.  Generally, a taxpayer (or representative) asks the IRS criminal investigation division for a &#8220;pre-clearance&#8221;.  If granted, it essentially means that the taxpayer is not already a person of interest to the IRS for offshore accounts.  Then the taxpayer has thirty days to comply with the reporting obligations by filing an &#8220;<a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/ltr-voluntary-disclosure01312011__1_.pdf">offshore disclosure letter</a>&#8220;.  That letter discloses the source of the funds, informs the IRS if the taxpayer or related entities are under audit or criminal investigation, and estimates the highest values and income of the offshore accounts for the years between 2003 and 2010.  The taxpayer has to reveal the country, institution, contact at the institution, date account opened, information about any entities connected with the account(s), and details of all meetings and other communications with the account institution and with other advisers about the account.  Once accepted into the program, the taxpayer must make a &#8220;full&#8221; voluntary disclosure by August 31, 2011&#8211;this includes filing amended returns, paying the prescribed penalties, providing complete information on facilitators of the offsore accounts, and filing a closing agreement with the IRS.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The Q&#038;A uses an example of a person with a million on deposit since before 2003, earning $50,000 a year from 2003 to 2010. </p>
<p><em>They would pay $518,000 plus interest. This includes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Tax of $140,000 (8 years at $17,500) plus interest,</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>An accuracy-related penalty of $28,000 (i.e., $140,000 x 20%), and</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>An additional penalty, in lieu of the FBAR and other potential penalties that may apply, of $350,000 (i.e., $1,400,000 x 25%).</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If the taxpayers didn’t come forward, when the IRS discovered their offshore activities, they would face up to $4,543,000 in tax, accuracy-related penalty, and FBAR penalty. The taxpayers would also be liable for interest and possibly additional penalties, and an examination could lead to criminal prosecution.</em></p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this plays out.  Some of my colleagues who practice in this area tell me they believe there are at least several hundred thousand Americans who have &#8220;substantial&#8221; foreign accounts.  But there are a number of them, I understand, who have decided to take the risk of not being discovered in order to continue to avoid paying these taxes and penalties.  As these programs increase the numbers of accountholders who report contacts, banks and advisers who have assisted in this process, the risk becomes measurably greater.  Personally, I hope that those who choose to continue being scofflaws are the losers and not the government (which is just &#8220;we the people&#8221;).</p>

<p><strong>Canadian economic growth is about two percentage points higher under Liberal governments</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=346">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>Frances Woolley has a piece in <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2011/02/why-is-canadian-gdp-growth-higher-under-liberal-governments.html">Worthwhile Canadian Initiatives</a> that begins like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Canadian economic growth is about two percentage points higher under Liberal governments. At least, that&#8217;s what my colleagues Stephen Ferris and Marcel Voia found in their recent article in the <a href="http://economics.ca/cgi/jab?journal=cje&#038;article=v44n1p0107">Canadian Journal of Economics</a> (earlier ungated version <a href="http://www2.carleton.ca/economics/ccms/wp-content/ccms-files/cep09-11.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>This is a large impact. For example, if the economy was growing at 1 percent under a Conservative government, switching to a Liberal government would increase the predicted GDP growth rate to around 3 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been reading my blog posts, or <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">Presimetrics</a>, the book I co-authored with Michael Kanell, you&#8217;ll recognize this is about the same conclusion that can be drawn about the United States.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Because of the similarity in outcomes for Canada and the US, its worth considering whether the drivers are the same.  Woolley suggests two explanations for the Canadian results.  The first:</p>
<blockquote><p>One hypothesis begins with the observation that the Liberals are Canada&#8217;s natural governing party &#8211; they have been in office more often, and for longer, than any other political party. Temporary interruptions to their rule, for example, the election of R.B. Bennett, occur when something goes seriously wrong. </p></blockquote>
<p>This explanation doesn&#8217;t work for the US.  Democrats have outperformed Republicans from 1929 (the first year for which data is available from the BEA) to the present.  That&#8217;s 81 years, and Republicans have had the Oval Office for 39 of them &#8211; just slightly less than half.  In the period from 1953 to the 2008 the period we focus on in our book, Democrats still easily outperform Republicans, there are a total of 56 years, and Republicans have been President for 36 of them. </p>
<p>The second explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p>A second hypothesis is that Liberals pursue pro-poor policies and Conservatives don&#8217;t. This means that Liberals will tend to be elected when people are feeling poor, that is, at the bottom of the business cycle, whereas Conservatives will tend to be elected at the top.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one also doesn&#8217;t work in the US.  Yes, FDR and Obama were elected when economic disasters were underway, but malaise was the word of the day when Reagan was elected.  (And leaving out FDR and Obama doesn&#8217;t change results.)  On the other hand, JFK was elected and both Truman and LBJ became President when the country&#8217;s mood was exceptionally strong. (Growth under LBJ was second only to FDR, and Truman turned in the worst performance among Democrats thus far.)  </p>
<p>Frankly, I think the first sentence of the second hypothesis may have some juice to it, but you have to divorce it from the sentence that follows it: </p>
<blockquote><p>A second hypothesis is that Liberals pursue pro-poor policies and Conservatives don&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>The difference in &#8220;pro-poor&#8221; versus not &#8220;pro-poor&#8221; explains tax policy, and tax policy <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=301">correlates with growth</a> in the US.  The difference in &#8220;pro-poor&#8221; versus not &#8220;pro-poor&#8221; explains tax policy, and tax policy <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=301">correlates with growth</a> in the US.  I suspect, but I haven&#8217;t checked yet, that there are two other differences between Democrats and Republicans in the US, and Liberals and Conservatives that matter:</p>
<p>1.  Where the money gets spent.  (i.e., &#8220;pro-poor&#8221; spending v. not &#8220;pro-poor&#8221; spending)<br />2.  Regulation of externalities</p>
