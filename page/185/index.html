                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Some of you may remember that last cycle I sometimes posted charts showing real exports and imports versus trend to show how trade  was doing.  It is now over two years since imports and exports bottomed so I thought It was time to update those charts for this cycle.  But as I started looking at the data I made a very interesting discovery.</p>
<p>Real petroleum exports &#8212; both crude and refined product  &#8212; are exploding. After being flat for years, petroleum exports have been growing at some 33% to 50% rates since 2006.  They have leaped from about $2 B (2005 $) to over $5 B (2005 $).  This is a significant development that few people have recognized.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2m-fsy_3MJI/Tm-0eZbqQcI/AAAAAAAABvs/OnZs76T7vCk/s1600/Clipboard01%2Breal%2Boil%2Bexp.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2m-fsy_3MJI/Tm-0eZbqQcI/AAAAAAAABvs/OnZs76T7vCk/s320/Clipboard01%2Breal%2Boil%2Bexp.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>To but this in perspective, petroleum exports had been a relative small factor in trade and the economy for years.  For example from 1994 to 2005 petroleum exports had fallen from a sum equal to about 10% of petroleum imports  to under 5%.   But they now amount  to almost a third of petroleum imports.<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7TTT6cCpQTU/Tm-0wDttVnI/AAAAAAAABv0/Wg46s4PfjtY/s1600/Clipboard01%2BOIL%2BSHARE%2BOF%2BIMP.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7TTT6cCpQTU/Tm-0wDttVnI/AAAAAAAABv0/Wg46s4PfjtY/s320/Clipboard01%2BOIL%2BSHARE%2BOF%2BIMP.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Consequently,  when you look at US dependence on foreign oil it makes a big difference in the analysis if you just look at the data on gross imports or if you adjust the data to look at net petroleum imports &#8212; imports less exports. Gross imports show that since the last cyclical peak the combination of falling demand and even  expanded domestic production over the last couple of years had produced a significant drop in real petroleum imports. I&#8217;ve long used oil imports as a measure of the US marginal demand for oil.   This approach shows that real petroleum imports have fallen to their level of about ten years sago &#8212; a rather import ant development.   But if you look at the net data, real petroleum imports are back to levels of 20 years ago.  This shows that the US is making much more significant progress  in reducing its dependence on foreign oil than is generally recognized.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BJWHDcv-El4/Tm-07kJVeMI/AAAAAAAABv8/Rnx42LgyM_s/s1600/Clipboard01%2BGROSS%2BNET%2BOIL.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BJWHDcv-El4/Tm-07kJVeMI/AAAAAAAABv8/Rnx42LgyM_s/s320/Clipboard01%2BGROSS%2BNET%2BOIL.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>This also has a significant impact on the US balance of trade. In recent months the real trade balance has appeared to be bottoming and this has been starting  to get economists and analysts optimistic that trade could make a significant positive contribution to growth in coming quarters.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bk7dFnUjJlc/Tm-1DjEBpOI/AAAAAAAABwE/BxJ4UXcPJHE/s1600/Clipboard01%2BBALANCE%2BALL.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bk7dFnUjJlc/Tm-1DjEBpOI/AAAAAAAABwE/BxJ4UXcPJHE/s320/Clipboard01%2BBALANCE%2BALL.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>But the improvement has almost all stemmed from petroleum.  The real trade balance excluding petroleum is still deteriorating, although maybe not as severely as it had been earlier in the cycle.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ynxvrUXmpOc/Tm-1Lr3y2jI/AAAAAAAABwM/CVyD3eZr1UI/s1600/Clipboard01%2BBALANCE%2BX%2BOIL.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ynxvrUXmpOc/Tm-1Lr3y2jI/AAAAAAAABwM/CVyD3eZr1UI/s320/Clipboard01%2BBALANCE%2BX%2BOIL.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Moreover, if you look at real non-petroleum exports they appear to be rolling over. When I tried to do a trend analysis neither a linear or  an exponential equation generated a good fit.  I had to resort to a polynomial equation to get a good fit.   But real non-petroleum exports shows  significantly worse prospects for trade adding to growth in coming quarters that the consensus expects.<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5xiDiyBlTag/TnDFgQw1NZI/AAAAAAAABwk/KIkA_Xu2d24/s1600/Clipboard11.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5xiDiyBlTag/TnDFgQw1NZI/AAAAAAAABwk/KIkA_Xu2d24/s320/Clipboard11.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>

                                <p>The Census Bureau has released estimates of poverty in 2010. Coverage focused on the headline poverty rate which is horrible enough. Much worse, 6.7% of people in the USA suffered severe poverty, that is lived in households with income less than half the poverty line. This is the highest severe poverty rate on record (the series only goes back to 1975 &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why). </p>
<p><a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/historical/people.html">Look at Table Five.</a></p>
<p>I blame welfare reform.  Yes the severe recession and slow recovery is a major factor, but the 2010 ratio of the severe poverty rate and the poverty rate is 0.444 which is also the highest on record.  That ratio is a crude way of looking at the effect of welfare reform. </p>
<p>Like the poverty rate, the severe poverty rate goes up in recessions, goes up when inequality increases and goes down when per capita income grows. However, the pattern is very different with a long term trend of increasing severe poverty and no correspond trend of the headline poverty rate. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I think it is clear that this can be explained with two acronyms AFDC and TANF. In 1975 the economy was in bad shape, the poverty rate was 12.3 % which is not vastly lower than the 2010 poverty rate of 15.1%. The severe poverty rate was 3.7 % less than 56% of the current rate. The fraction of people in poverty but not severe poverty was 0.301 in 1975 much lower than it is now.</p>
<p>During the period of high inflation, the real value of welfare benefits declined. This explains at least part of the increase in severe poverty. In 1983 the poverty rate peaked at 15.2% and the severe poverty rate peaked at 5.9%. Compared to 1983 a smaller fraction of people are in poverty but a larger fraction of people are in severe poverty. I think that welfare reform is the only plausible explanation.</p>
<p>If the ratio of number in severe poverty to number in poverty were the same as in 1983 the severe poverty rate would be less than 5.9%.  </p>
<p>This post is an update of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/all-time-record-level-of-severe-poverty.html">my post about the 2009 severe poverty rate </a>(I admit to cutting and pasting as if such an admission were necessary).  The political debate has not taken the record severe poverty rate into consideration. Quite the opposite. As far as I know, no politician dares discuss reversing welfare reform.   </p>
<p> I think the still widely accepted conclusion that welfare reform was a great success is based on two gross and obvious errors. </p>
<p>First the matter was considered to have been decided by 2000. Only specialists reconsidered the analysis of welfare reform with any data not collected during the amazing boom of the late 90s. </p>
<p>Second a huge amount of attention is focused on the poverty rate and almost no one ever looks at the severe poverty rate. It is as if people think that it doesn&#8217;t matter how poor one is once one is under the poverty line. This is more extreme than not caring about income distribution. </p>
<p>But it is accepted as a fact that welfare reform worked like a charm. Evidence which isn&#8217;t more than 11 years old, and the fact that $11,000 <br />It&#8217;s almost as if most people had no clue what it is like to be poor so that they don&#8217;t even know that the poor are much poorer than they used to be.</p>

                                <p>The current low level of long term interest rates is creating all types of debate about what it is suppose to signify and what investors are discounting.</p>
<p>Maybe they are not signaling anything and it is just a return to normal for interest rates.  For example, from 1871 to 1960 long Treasuries were below 4% some 75%of the time.   Over the long sweep of history very low rates were more the norm than the high rates of recent decades.  Maybe the recent history was the exception and we are now just returning to a more normal level of rates.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>

<p><strong>The Effect of Individual Income Tax Rates on the Economy, Part 6: 1981 &#8211; 1993</strong> </p>
<p>This post is the sixth in a series that looks at the relationship between real economic growth and the top individual marginal tax rate.  The first looked at the period from 1901 to 1928, the second from 1929 to 1940, the third from 1940 to 1950, the fifth looked at 1950 &#8211; 1968, and the sixth from 1968 to 1988.  Because the Reagan era is so pivotal in the American psyche, though it was covered in the last post, I intend to focus on it again.  The last post included the lead in to Reagan&#8217;s term, this post contains the follow-up to his term.  In this post I&#8217;ll look at the period from 1981 to 1993.  </p>
<p>Before I begin, a quick recap&#8230;  both the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1901 &#8211; 1928 period</a> and the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_22.html">1929 &#8211; 1940</a> failed to show the textbook relationship between taxes and growth.  In fact, it seems that for both those periods, there was at least a bit of support for the notion that growth was faster in periods of rising tax rates than in periods when tax rates were coming down.  It is worth noting that growth from 1933 to 1940 was generally quite a bit faster than at any other peacetime period since data has been available, both on average and for individual years.  Not quite quite what people believe, but that&#8217;s what it is.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_29.html">1940 &#8211; 1950</a> period, we did observe slower economic growth following a tax hike and faster economic growth followed a tax reduction.  However, that happened when the top marginal tax rate was boosted above 90%.  <br />Interestingly enough, though the so-called &#8220;Kennedy Tax Cuts&#8221; are often used as one of the prime exhibits on the benefits of cutting taxes, a look at the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1950 &#8211; 1968</a> period yields no such conclusion.  Growth rates were already rising before the tax cuts occurred in 1964 and 1965, reached a peak when the tax cuts took place, and started shrinking immediately afterwards. The other period that is always pointed to as evidence that tax cuts spur growth is the Reagan years, which showed up in the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_1325.html">1968 &#8211; 1988</a> post.  It turns out that put into context, the Reagan years produced one year of rapid but not particularly extraordinary growth a few years after tax cuts began.  That&#8217;s it.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Real GDP figures used in this post come from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis.</a>  Top individual marginal tax rate figures used in this post come from the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a>.  As in previous posts, I’m using growth rate from one year to the next (e.g., the 1980 figure shows growth from 1980 to 1981) to avoid “what leads what” questions. If there is a causal relationship between the tax rate and the growth rate, the growth rate from 1980 to 1981 cannot be causing the 1980 tax rate.  Let me stress this point again as I&#8217;ve been getting people e-mailing me to tell me I&#8217;ve got the growth rates shifted a year.  That is correct, and is being done on purpose (and is shown on the graph labels).  To avoid questions of causality, the growth rate in year X used in this post is the growth rate from year X to year X+1.  And when I say &#8220;to avoid questions of causality&#8221; &#8211; you&#8217;d be amazed at how many people write me when I don&#8217;t do this and insist that sure, higher tax rates seem to be correlated with faster growth, but that&#8217;s because when growth is faster governments feel more willing to charge higher tax rates.</p>
<p>With the preliminaries out of the way, let&#8217;s get started.  The first graph shows the tax rates from 1981 to 1993 along with the t to t+1 real GDP growth rates.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_mUizk7USxg/Tm1ODoiD7lI/AAAAAAAAAtI/CoYppBxqLJA/s1600/Figure_1_-_1981_-_1993.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_mUizk7USxg/Tm1ODoiD7lI/AAAAAAAAAtI/CoYppBxqLJA/s320/Figure_1_-_1981_-_1993.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that what the graph does not, repeat, does not show is that lower tax rates have much to do with faster economic growth.  In fact, some of the slowest sustained economic &#8220;growth&#8221; that occurred during the Reagan-Bush years coincided with the lowest tax rates:  28% and 31%.  The one standout year occurred when tax rates were at 50%, and had been at 50% for a few years.  And yet, somehow this period has entered the public consciousness as Exhibit A that Tax Cuts Work.  </p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;d like to point out that unlike the folks who venerate Reagan today, Reagan himself did have a reason, an excellent reason, in fact, to try tax cuts&#8230; at least the first round of tax cuts.  Looking back from the vantage point of 1980 and leaving out the WW2 years, real economic growth when tax rates were in the 90% + range was lower than it was when tax rates were in the 80% to 89.9% range, and that was slower than when tax rates were in the 70% to 79.9% range, and that in turn was slower than when tax rates were in the 60% to 69.9%.  That is shown in the graph below.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O2fwRwsWdSI/Tm1OYbsuqPI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/Kk4hp-yUxF0/s1600/Figure_2_-_1981_-_1993.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O2fwRwsWdSI/Tm1OYbsuqPI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/Kk4hp-yUxF0/s320/Figure_2_-_1981_-_1993.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>Note that all the information contained in Figure 2 was available by the time Reagan took office.  If the information in Figure 2 is all you have,  it isn&#8217;t unreasonable to wonder whether further reductions in the tax rate will lead to faster economic growth.  Of course, Reagan did have a bit more information available.  He also had growth rates from the last time tax rates were in the 24% and 25% range  (i.e., the start of the Great Depression) which were negative&#8230; and which might have tipped him off that the relationship between tax rates and growth is actually quadratic.  But I guess its a bit much to expect any of Reagan&#8217;s advisors to consider anything like a <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/24732335">quadratic relationship</a>. </p>
<p>In any case, we can combine Figures 1 and 2 to put the Reagan &#8211; Bush rates into context:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uAgbprfASbo/Tm1QByAQpyI/AAAAAAAAAtY/7ALYtKzMX1k/s1600/Figure_3_-_1981_-_1993.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uAgbprfASbo/Tm1QByAQpyI/AAAAAAAAAtY/7ALYtKzMX1k/s320/Figure_3_-_1981_-_1993.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering, during seven of the 12 Reagan-Bush years, growth rates were actually below the average rate observed when top marginal tax rates were above 90%&#8230; and the really slow growth during the Reagan &#8211; Bush era occurred disproportionately when tax rates were at the 28% and 31%.  That is to say, when tax rates were at their lowest levels in the Reagan &#8211; Bush era, growth rates were also at their lowest.   And as the graph also shows, every single year, repeat, every single year of the Reagan Bush had a lower average growth rate than when tax rates were in the 60% to 69.9% range.  </p>
<p>So&#8230;  what we don&#8217;t from the Reagan &#8211; Bush era is anything that supports the notion that lower tax rates correlate with faster economic growth.  (Note&#8230; correlation does not imply causality, but lack of correlation certainly does imply lack of causality.)  We do see that it could have been a rational experiment for Reagan to cut tax rates from 70% to 50%.  It was not a rational experiment, based on what happened at 50%, to cut rates further, and the result was easily predictable.  </p>
<p>And speaking of rational&#8230;  the story the data tells is strongly at odds with what is commonly believed.  And this isn&#8217;t ancient history.  Most of us lived through this.  It isn&#8217;t rational for us to believe things that aren&#8217;t true.  But collectively, we do.  And its leading to crummy growth rates.  What a surprise.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Yesterday in the <em>New York Times</em> Greg Mankiw &#8212; a professor of economics at Harvard, an advisor to the governor of Massachusetts, in the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and a former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under president Bush &#8212; had a column in which he argued that a cut in the corporate tax rate would induce greater investment. This is a key premise of Republican campaigns that has driven Republican policy since the early 1980s. The article is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/business/business-investment-as-a-key-to-recovery.html?_r=1">here</a>.</p>
<p>We should look at the record and see how well such cuts to corporate taxes actually  has worked.</p>
<p><em>First, average corporate profits versus tax business pays.</em> Contrary to the statutory rate of 39% widely quoted, the effective rate corporations actually pay is now about 22%. That is down from about 50% in 1950 and a local peak of some 44% in the early 1980s. The right likes to compare the statutory rate to other advanced countries statutory rate and claim that the US has about the highest corporate tax among advanced countries. But according to a recent study by the US Treasury the US effective rate is in about the middle of the pack of effective rates for advanced countries.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>

<p><em>Second, let&#8217;s look at after tax profits as a percent of GDP</em>. Despite cyclical swing there has been a strong secular trend since 1950. From 1950 to the early 1980s taxes as a percent of GDP declined from about 10% of GDP to under 4%. Since 1980 it has rebounded from under 4% back to about 10% of GDP and this measure appears to be on the verge of breaking out to a new record high.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hnBB05kYqEg/Tmvjj8TfCxI/AAAAAAAABvE/iyB8Uln6R7A/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hnBB05kYqEg/Tmvjj8TfCxI/AAAAAAAABvE/iyB8Uln6R7A/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Next look at <em>business investment as a share of GDP </em>. Again, despite cyclical swings there appears to be a secular trend. From 1950 to 1981 it rose and reached an all time peak of 14% in the early 1980s. Since 1980 it has been trending down from 14% and is now back to about the 10% level it was at in 1950.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0pVj6DjDgxE/TmvgPCNj74I/AAAAAAAABu8/nVla0eObRg4/s1600/Clipboard03.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0pVj6DjDgxE/TmvgPCNj74I/AAAAAAAABu8/nVla0eObRg4/s320/Clipboard03.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>&#8230;and compare it to <em>taxes as a percent of GDP</em>. Note the secular swing in investment is the exact opposite of the secular trend in profits. From 1950 to 1980 profits fell and investment rose. Since 1980 profits rose and investment fell. This is the exact opposite of Mankiw&#8217;s theory that cutting corporate taxes will lead to higher investments.</p>
<p>Mankiw writes a column for the NY Times every few weeks. Maybe in his next column he can explain why we should ignore this evidence that directly contradicts his theory.</p>
<p>His theory appears to be like the supply side theory that if we cut personal taxes on savings that people will save more. Since 1980 we have created IRA and other instruments that allow consumers to save on a tax free basis and increase their returns. So what happened to the personal savings rate over this period, it fell from 14% to almost 0%. This has to be about the greatest failure of an economic theory since communism. Remember, Milton Friedman said the most important test of a theory is how its forecasts work. Using Friedman&#8217;s basis the supply side theory about personal savings was a abject failure.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m going to surprise you by saying that I completely agree with Mankiw that corporate profits taxes should be cut. But of course there is a catch.</p>
<p>What I want corporations to pay taxes on is their profits as defined by the Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures (GAAP) rather than profits as defined by the IRS. Congress does not establish GAAP so this change would massively cut the ability of Congress to create loopholes or special cases in the tax code. As a consequence incentives for firms to buy-off politicians would be massively reduced. If you are a corporate CEO would rather use the money you now have to spend on Washington lobbyist and expensive tax lawyers to actually expand your business. My primary objective is to reduce the power of corporate money in politics and if Mankiw is right that it increases investment all the better.</p>
<p>Almost to a man Republican and business leaders strongly agree that the US should not have industrial planning. Politicians should not be in the business of picking winner and losers. But the US has a major industrial planning system, it is just that we call it the federal tax code. And generally the critics are right, Washington does a poor job of picking winners and losers.</p>
<p>According to the GAO the industries with the highest effective tax rates like information technology are frequently the fastest growing industries. Moreover the slowest growing industries, like oil, have the lowest effective tax rate. The GAO estimate that the oil industries&#8217; effective tax rate is about 11%, or about half the overall corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>Apparently oil executives learned decades ago that the get a much higher return on their capital if they use it to buy political favors rather that actually drilling for more oil. Surprisingly, domestic oil production actually rose in 2009 and 2010. This is the first consecutive annual increase in domestic oil production since Carter was president and oil faced price controls and windfall profits taxes. Maybe the oil executives realized they could not buy-off Obama and decided that to grow  profits they had to do something really radical, like increasing domestic oil production.</p>

<p>Can someone explain to me why people volunteer at for-profit hospitals?  I can understand volunteering at a not-for-profit hospital, but how is volunteering at a for-profit hospital different from, say, volunteering at Exxon-Mobil or Wal-Mart?</p>

                                <p>NYTBR, 11 September 2011</p>
<p>Ten years ago today, nineteen people, including fifteen Saudis&#8211;using funding from the House of Saud and led by a distinguished member of that House&#8211;used airplanes to attack the U.S., destroying the World Trade Towers, damaging the Pentagon, and being prevented from attacking the White House only by the heroic efforts of passengers on board the fourth plane and a suicide mission by an unarmed U.S. fighter jet.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was quick action from President Bush and his Administration. They detained all fourteen of Osama bin Laden&#8217;s relatives in the United States, interrogating each. This was followed by the execution of surgical strikes within Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden himself was hiding. By the time Special Forces troops captured him in the caves near Tora Bora, in part due to intelligence gained from his relatives, domestic uprisings and U.N. support led to the overthrow of the Taliban government.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>There were rumors there would be war with Saudi Arabia. But he Administration enacted high-level discussions (using, allegedly, some still-classified data as incentives) that were quickly followed by regime change in Saudi Arabia. That country&#8217;s new leaders provided compensation for costs and victims, as well as intelligence on previously unknown Pakistani participation.</p>
<p>On the domestic front, Rudolph Giuliani&#8211;who had moved the NYC Emergency Response headquarters from the safety of the basement of One Police Plaza to the 25th floor of a building that had been attacked eight years before, and who declared spending money on upgrading communications equipment for firefighters a waste&#8211;was barely saved from a Lynch mob of New Yorkers. He is rumored to have moved to Arizona, having been shunned by the President and the news media.</p>
<p>So now, ten years later, we find some American authors writing alternative histories about that time. The most recent, and one of the most absurd, is Philip Roth&#8217;s <em>Becoming Who We Are</em>, in which the Bush Administration assists the Bin Laden family in flying out of the United States (even before domestic commercial flights resume), becomes even closer to the Saudi leadership (there is a scene in the novel of Bush holding hands with the Saudi King while posing for photographs), and declares war on Iraq.</p>
<p>Even more problematic, Roth imagines Giuliani being touted as a hero, while the Bush Administration tortures prisoners, committing what most readers will correctly view as war crimes.</p>
<p>Perhaps saddest of all, Roth postulates an uprising of &#8220;Christian Conservatives&#8221; who vociferously and repeatedly applaud both of the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians and wanton torture of prisoners—and who, in this novel, are largely credited with re-electing President Bush despite those revelations and an economy driven to stagnation by war—cheering the mere suggestion that an execution, even of someone who is clearly innocent, will occur. After Roth&#8217;s frequent but appropriate mention of &#8220;blood libel&#8221; in <em>The Plot Against America</em>, one probably ought not be surprised that some &#8220;Christian&#8221; characters of this novel would act in such a manner, but it is a daunting leap of faith nonetheless. (That Roth&#8217;s narrator is aware enough to note that it is not the &#8220;Christians,&#8221; but rather those in the highest income brackets who are—for the first time in United States history—not taxed to pay for a war who make the difference in the 2004 election arguably is even more damning of his portrayal.)</p>
<p>Roth has had a long and noble career, and his recent forays into alternative history&#8211;most notably his portrayal of <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/09/liveblogging-world-war-ii-september-11-1941.html">leading isolationist Charles Lindbergh</a> [link added] in the aforementioned novel&#8211;have been based in a deep knowledge of the way those personages acted publicly and privately.  That he would undermine that with an absurdist piece in which the President of the United States squanders opportunities and weakens his own country by starting multiple wars is unfortunate at best. We can only hope Mr. Roth&#8217;s next work recovers the historical veracity for which he is known, rather than this deranged flight of fancy.</p>

<p>Angry Bear and I have reached an understanding regarding the blog and decision making.  He has been referred to as owning the blog, as much as it can be with such a rowdy group, and has agreed to transfer this ownership to me, sort of the Bill Gates giving over to Steve Ballmer analogy, to use AB&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>If I was to devote more time to the blog&#8217;s expansion and look, I felt that the originator of AB should give the go ahead to transfer ownership his blessing as respect for what he created, the goodwill built to his initial retirement and after, and the material I would like to steal from the days of AB, pgl, and Kash that I was not a part of.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge cactus as a pivotal player over the last several years as continuing this excellence.  As I told him in an e-mail, I still ask myself &#8216;What would cactus do?&#8217; when faced with executive decisions regarding the blog.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with this noisy bunch of people with a great deal of pleasure, trepidation which I will not expose very often, and learning.</p>
<p>If either one of us had earned the same money as Gates or Ballmer, we would not be here with you today.  You guys are so lucky!</p>
<p>Dan</p>
