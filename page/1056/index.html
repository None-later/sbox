                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Inspired by a question from PGL about whether the US still has a comparative advantage in agricultural products, I have put together another trade-related table.  The table provides a simple measure of where the US&#8217;s comparative advantages and disadvantages lie. </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/x_m_ratio.jpg">
<div>(Note: for a list of items in each end-use category, see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/Principal_End_Use_Categories.pdf">this document</a>.)</div>
<p>For each category of goods, the table divides exports by imports during the first three months of 2004 and 2005.  So for example in 2005, total exports of $211.7 bn divided by total imports of $381.6 bn yield a ratio for all goods of 0.55.  The total X/M ratio for the US fell from 2004, because the US&#8217;s imports grew by more (in $ terms) than its exports.  Obviously, a surplus in any category would yield an X/M ratio greater than 1.00, and a deficit yields an X/M ratio less than one.  During the first three months of this year, the US ran a deficit in every broad end-use category of goods.</p>
<p>In determining where the US has a comparative advantage, each category of goods should be compared to the overall ratio for total exports and imports.  A reasonable definition of comparative advantage is when a category of goods has a better-than-average X/M ratio.  By that definition the US has a comparative advantage in the production of those goods that have an X/M ratio that is higher than 0.58 in 2004, or 0.55.  </p>
<p>So to answer PGL&#8217;s original question: yes, clearly the US still does have a substantial comparative advantage in the production of agricultural products, along with capital goods and industrial supplies.  The US is currently running a deficit in all three categories, but that is simply because the US is importing so much of everything to satisfy the difference between its consumption and production.  The US&#8217;s comparative advantage hasn&#8217;t changed as a result of its trade deficit, so as soon as individuals and/or the federal government in the US start spending less and saving more, we can expect trade surpluses to return in those categories.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This morning&#8217;s release of the <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/newsrel/tradnewsrelease.htm">trade data for March</a> by the BEA showed a bit of a narrowing of the trade deficit on goods and services, from $60.6 bn in February down to $55.0 bn in March.  This was due to slightly higher exports and a surprising drop in US imports.</p>
<p>At this point let me add the usual reminder that one observation does not make a trend; this data really gives us no clue as to whether the US trade deficit has peaked and is starting down (which I think is unlikely) or whether March was just an aberration.  It&#8217;s far safer to add up or average several months of data before trying to paint a picture of what&#8217;s happening to the economy.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s data release made me curious to investigate some more details about the US&#8217;s importing behavior.  So I&#8217;ve put together a couple of tables that help to describe what kinds of things the US imports, and from where.  First the &#8220;What?&#8221; table:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/imports_what.jpg"></p>
<p>And next the &#8220;From Where?&#8221; table:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/imports_where.jpg"></p>
<p>Some things on these tables may be slightly surprising to some.  For example, while US imports from China are growing rapidly, the US still imports more from Canada and the EU.  Consistent with that is the fact that US imports include lots of capital and industrial goods, in addition to consumer goods.</p>
<p>This is important to keep in mind.  The first thing that most people think about when they think of US imports is cheap consumer goods from China.  While there is certainly plenty of truth in that conception, it would be just as accurate to think about US imports as being composed of industrial equipment from Canada and electical machinery from Germany.  </p>
<p>Thinking about it this way reminds us that the US&#8217;s voracious appetite for imports is not the result of low labor costs in China, but rather the result of a fundamental imbalance in which the US consumes more than it produces of virtually all types of goods.  In many of the countries with which the US runs a trade deficit labor costs are actually higher than in the US, but since those countries don&#8217;t consume everything they produce the US imports from them.  The cause of the trade deficit is therefore clear: it is simply the direct result of the US&#8217;s lack of saving.</p>

As far as long-run solvency defined in terms of the size of the 75-year shortfall, the former closes only 60% of it and the latter closes only 30% of it.  In terms of the estimated date for Fund “exhaustion”, the Pozen plus privatization plan accelerates the date from 2041 to 2030.  In terms of the estimated date for when benefits exceed receipts, the Pozen plus privatization plan accelerates the date from 2017 to 2011.  </p>
<p>Personally, I think this last criteria is just plan silly – but the President and his minions tout it ad nausam.  Jason Furman’s analysis shows that the proposal these minions are touting makes matters worse per their favorite criteria.</p>

                                <p>I pity Stephen Moore as the victim of poor timing.  A Federal Appeals Court just gave <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7804571">Dick Cheney</a> a victory in his coverup regarding the 2001 energy task force.  The State Department told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/10/un.ambassador.ap/index.html">no</a> on the Bolton documents request.  And the National Review decides to today is the day to run Stephen’s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/moore/moore200505100827.asp">claim</a> that we have too much whistleblowing activity.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll grant his argument that we should review what is the best incentive structure for detecting fraud, but I&#8217;m a little surprised that a supply-sider is arguing against money being a proper incentive.</p>

                                <p>Many thanks to <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2005/05/index.html#000323">William Polley</a> for a thoughtful post on the employment-population ratio.  He follows up on my critique of the unemployment ratio – where its decline over the past couple of years is a combination of a weak recovery in employment relative to adult population and a fall in the civilian labor force participation rate.  On the later, William notes two <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6018&#038;sequence=0">CBO</a> <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=5803&#038;sequence=0">reports</a>, which have gone to the top of my read pile.</p>
<p>Update: The <a href="http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet;jsessionid=f0309bcddc03%243F%243F%240">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> allows one to form customized tables of items such as labor force participation rates for various subsets of the labor force.  A few Angrybear readers noted that the largest decline in labor force participation rates was for teenagers.  The table below takes various age groups starting with the 16 to 24 year-old bracket and ending with the 55 and over bracket (mislabeled in my table) – and compares the group’s labor force participation rate as of 2000QIV and 2005 QI.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/age.jpg"></p>
<p>This data indicates two important things: (1) while the labor force participation rate did fall dramatically among those under 25, it actually rose for those 55 and over; and (2) labor force participation is rather low for the 55 and over group.  The baby boomers generation has reached age 55 – and since the overall labor force participation rate is a weighted average of each group’s participation rate, William Polley’s point that we are about to experience a decline in the natural rate for the the labor force participation rate (my responsibility for this odd terminology) seems quite reasonable.  Additional note, confession, and request: I had tried to get the customized tables to give the data for the 55-64 group and it would only give the 55 and over series.  Anyone with better luck navigating the BLS tables?.</p>
<p>Update II:  Many thanks to Donald Coffin who did have more luck with the BLS tables than I did.  For the 55-64 year old group, labor force participation was 59.2% as of Dec. 2000 and 62.9% as of March 2005.</p>

                                <p>When interviewing Mary Matalin, Tim Russert should invite someone other than her husband to stand in for the Democrats.  Nothing against James Carville, but when Mary says things that are <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7761272">simply not true</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>MS. MATALIN:  There is nowhere in our history, once &#8211; Abe Fortas -who did not have majority &#8211; a legislative filibuster used for the purposes of stopping nominees.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Someone should call her on these things.  If Mr. Fortas did not have a majority in 1968, then why did the Republicans need to filibuster?  </p>
<p>When the topic got around to whether Senator Clinton should be our nominee in 2008, Mary said:</p>
<blockquote><p>MS. MATALIN:  I think she&#8217;s charismatic, she is &#8211; she&#8217;ll have a ton of money. She has a bunch of brilliant people, not the least of which is her husband and his &#8230;(unintelligible).  But no Democrat, Democratic president, has been elected in the last half century that didn&#8217;t have some Southern bona fides</p></blockquote>
<p>So Arkansas is a Northern state and President Kennedy was from the Confederate state of Massachusetts?</p>

                                <p>The Usual Suspects are lining up to push the third plank of the Bush Social Security propaganda.  On one hand, the Usual Suspects tell us that the Pozen plan <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/05/AR2005050501680_pf.html">only slows the rate of growth of benefits</a>.  On the other hand, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/lowry/lowry200505030803.asp">only the wealthy will sacrifice so the poor can have more</a>.  So when <br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/02/opinion/02krugman.html?hp=&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;position=">Paul Krugman</a> points out that no one gets more benefits and the middle class suffers the largest cuts in terms of percentage of retirement wealth, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/07/opinion/l07social.html?n=Top%2FOpinion%2FEditorials%20and%20Op-Ed">Al “not Glenn” Hubbard</a> tells those making around $40,000 a year know that they are affluent and can afford these benefit cuts (and continuing to pay the 12.4% payroll contribution). </p>
<p>These defenses of the Pozen plan strike me as the modern day equivalent of the remarks attributed to Marie Antoinette – “if the people have no bread, then let them eat cake.” This weekend, the New York Times provided us what Kevin Drum calls the <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_05/006277.php">The Bobbsey Twins</a>.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/opinion/08brooks.html?">David Brooks</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>By embracing the progressive indexing of Social Security benefits, the president has asked us to make a shared sacrifice for the common good. He&#8217;s asking middle- and upper-class folks to accept benefit cuts so there will be money for the people who are really facing poverty. He has asked us to redistribute money down the income scale. Why should programs for children and families be strangled so Donald Trump can get bigger benefit checks? </p></blockquote>
<p>Having told us that privatization guarantees high stock market returns, which was plank #1 for the propaganda, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/07/opinion/07tierney.htm">John Tierney</a> dusts off plank #2, which is the system goes broke around 2017.  The political risk that Tierney talks about comes down to whether the GOP will make permanent its various tax cuts on capital income – including the reduction in the top tiers of the income tax, dividend and other capital income tax reductions, and the elimination of the estate tax.  </p>
<p>Tierney’s most recent op-ed, however, exposes this progressivity argument for what it is.  Brooks et al. want to argue there is a shared sacrifice.  I’m not sure whether Mr. Trump even has employment income but certainly his capital income is many multiples of $90,000 a year.  So even including <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/views/articles/20040927galeorszag.htm">deferred taxes</a>, individuals such as Mr. Trump will likely get a significant overall tax break paid for by middle class workers – either in the form of future new taxes or continuing to contribute 12.4% of the wages to a Social Security system that will pay out less.  </p>
<p>Brooks et al. also want to argue that Bush is being principled and brave.  Yet, Bush-Cheney ’04 denied that they were planning to cut benefits during the President campaign – and when presented with the facts, Andrew Card tried to disown the Pozen plan.  The cynicism, dishonesty, and hypocrisy of these Bush minions aside, the middle class likely knows that Bush’s Social Security proposals are part of a massive shift of the tax burden onto them.  Now if these minions wish to say working class Americans are affluent enough to make sacrifices so Donald Trump can keep his tax cuts, maybe we Democrats should highlight their own words.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/opinion/09krugman.html?hp=&#038;pagewanted=print">Paul Krugman</a> was on the story before I was – again.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: How dare I leave <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200505100918.asp">Donald Luskin</a> off my list? He is rather desperate to accuse Krugman of a lie:</p>
<blockquote><p>Krugman flat-out lied when he wrote that “benefits for the poor would be maintained, not increased” in the president’s proposal. It’s true that under progressive indexing benefits for the lowest-wage earners would stay the same as under current law … Krugman also lied when he portrayed progressive indexing as “a plan to slash middle-class benefits.” It’s not a plan to “slash” benefits at all, or even reduce them. Under progressive indexing, everyone’s Social Security benefits will be greater than they are today, by the rate of inflation or more. What progressive indexing does is slow the runaway growth in benefits</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there is a lot more to Luskin’s latest rant – but he has failed to rebut anything Krugman wrote – although he does display his own stupidity and/or mendacity as usual.</p>

                                <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Forbes <a href="http://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2005/05/09/afx2012041.html">reported</a> today that UK housing prices are up &#8221; 0.31 pct from the previous quarter&#8221;.  That is a slight decline in real terms.  However the &#8220;volume of sales decreased by 34.77 pct&#8221;.  That is exactly how a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/housing-after-boom.html">housing bust</a> usually works:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Housing &#8220;bubbles&#8221; typically do not &#8220;pop”, rather prices tend to deflate slowly in real terms, over several years. Historically real estate prices display strong persistence and are sticky downward. Sellers want a price close to recent sales in their neighborhood, and buyers, sensing prices are declining, will wait for even lower prices. This means real estate markets do not clear immediately, and what we usually observe is a drop in transaction volumes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>   It is the drop in transaction volumes that causes general economic problems (slower retail sales, lower employment, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Original Post:</strong> &#8220;Are we there yet?&#8221; Soon.</p>
<p>Next year at this time I expect to be writing about how the falloff in housing is impacting the economy, but I wouldn’t be completely surprised if the housing bubble is still expanding. Speculative bubbles go on longer than most people can imagine.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Predicting the timing of a future economic event is not easy. Predicting what will happen is easier, though.&#8221;<br />Warren Buffet, 4/30/2005</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps we can look at the UK for guidance on timing. But first, here is another amazing story in the Washington Post from this morning, “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/07/AR2005050700198.html">It&#8217;s on the House</a>: Now Everybody Is Paying for Everything With Home Equity”. Also see Dr. Setser’s take: “<a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/setser/archives/2005/05/the_us_economy.html">The US economy, in a nutshell?</a>&#8221; as Setser ties the housing boom to the current account deficit &#8211; an ongoing theme.</p>
<p><strong>What is happening in the UK?</strong> The housing boom has apparently ended, and the retailers are already feeling the impact. According to the Telegraph this morning: &#8220;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2005/05/08/ccboom08.xml&#038;menuId=242&#038;sSheet=/money/2005/05/08/ixcoms.html">It&#8217;s bad and getting worse</a>&#8220;:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The longest and strongest consumer boom in recent history is over. And normally euphoric retailers are suddenly feeling very depressed &#8230;</p>
<p>The storm clouds hanging over the UK retail sector are looking greyer by the day. New figures from the British Retail Consortium, the industry body, will tomorrow show that high street sales over April fell by more than 3 per cent compared to the previous year.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That is on top of last week&#8217;s bleak numbers for retail and manufacturing, &#8220;<a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8209-1596982,00.html">UK Economy Shaken</a>&#8220;:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;High street sales suffered their steepest monthly drop for 13 years while manufacturing activity succumbed to its first decline in two years.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Friday morning the BBC reported that &#8220;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4514207.stm">Britain braced for credit crunch</a>&#8220;:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Not since the mid-1990s, as the last economic recession claimed its final victims, has so much debt pain been felt by so many people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…according to official figures nearly 26,000 property repossession orders were granted in the first three months of 2005, the highest number since 1995.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And sure enough, on Friday the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/story.jsp?story=636322">revealed</a> that &#8220;Personal bankruptcies leap 25 per cent to hit an all-time high&#8221;.<br />According to Steve Treharne, the head of personal insolvency at the accountants KPMG:<br />
<blockquote>“There is a big black cloud of debt hanging over the UK.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So for housing, is the UK leading the US?</strong> Here is a comparison of the monetary policy of the respective Central Banks. The <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/Links/setframe.html">Bank of England</a> started raising rates in November of 2003.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/USUK.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/USUK.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm">Federal Reserve</a> didn&#8217;t start raising rates until June, 2004. It appears the US is about 6 to 8 months behind the UK. Although both the US and UK rates were at 6% in Jan 2001, the Federal Reserve lowered US rates far lower than the UK and held rates lower for an extended period.  Still it is possible that housing in the US will not suffer until the Fed Fund rate is over 4% or higher &#8211; some time in the future.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll finish with another Buffett <a href="http://www.usafairtrade.com/icplan.htm">quote</a> (on the trade imbalance):<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I will close by reminding you again that I cried wolf once before. In general, the batting average of doomsayers in the U.S. is terrible. Our country has consistently made fools of those who were skeptical about either our economic potential or our resiliency. Many pessimistic seers simply underestimated the dynamism that has allowed us to overcome problems that once seemed ominous. We still have a truly remarkable country and economy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2118053/">Jacob Weisberg</a> has an interesting discussion of how the GOP has failed to live up to its 1995 promise to downsize the Federal government.  He points to a <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa543.pdf">Cato paper</a> documenting that inflation-adjusted spending for the 101 largest programs that the Republicans proposed to eliminate as unnecessary in 1995 has risen by 27%.  Cato should be congratulated on two counts: (1) one for noting that the GOP is not really “giving us our money back”, and (2) using real increases as opposed to nominal increases to make this particular point.  Alas, the Executive Summary starts off with the statement that total government spending increased by 33% during Bush&#8217;s first term, which has to reflect the nominal increase in spending.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Stephen Moore will join The Wall Street Journal as its senior economics writer.  While <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_05/006249.php">Kevin Drum</a> calls this a move to lower their collective intelligence, <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001359.html">Max Sawicky</a> suggests this move may actually increase the already low standards of the editorial page of what otherwise is a very good newspaper.  Since the problem with the editorial page has been not stupidity but rather mendacity, let me suggest that Moore can radically change this perception by pointing out the flaws in the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200505051554.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a>.  Kudlow wants you to believe that the Bush tax cuts have increased revenues by causing a supply-side boom to the economy even though he knows that the 2.5% average annual growth in real GDP over the past four years is below that 3.5% normal growth he keeps referring to.  For Moore’s convenience, I have graphed real Federal tax revenues excluding payroll contributions (see <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">NIPA table 3.2, line 2</a>) (which includes personal current taxes, corporate income taxes, taxes on production and imports, and taxes from rest of the world) – using the GDP deflator to convert nominal to real.  Tax collections were $1313.6 billion in 2000 but had fallen to $1023.1 billion in real terms by 2004.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/tax.jpg"></p>
<p>Of course, it might be difficult for Art Laffer’s co-author of the October 27, 2000 WSJ op-ed endorsement of George W. Bush to adopt my suggestion since Moore and Laffer tried to tell the WSJ readers that the Reagan tax cuts led to faster long-term growth and a doubling of tax revenues.  As noted by <a href="http://www.tnr.com/archive/06/063097/chait063097.html">Jonathan Chait</a>, Moore also suggested that the Clinton era was one of slow growth and weaker tax revenue growth than the Reagan era.  Moore will be happy to note the real tax revenue series we present here does not include payroll taxes given how Chait noted that much of the 1980’s increase in tax revenues was due to the Social Security reforms in 1983.  Moore and Laffer also pulled a bait-and-switch on the eve of the Bush-Gore election by citing real tax revenue growth for the 1920’s but subtly moving over to nominal tax revenue growth when discussing the Reagan-Bush41 era.  Again, our series consistently looks at real tax revenues not including payroll contributions.  </p>
<p>Of course, Moore would have to admit that real tax revenues were only 16.1% higher in 1992 versus 1980 – in part because real GDP growth averaged only 3.0% per year over this 12-year period.  Over the next eight years, real GDP growth averaged 3.7% per year and real tax revenues were 71.9% higher in 2000 than they were in 1992.  </p>
<p>Now I’m not asking Mr. Moore to give up on his small government philosophy.  Low tax rates don’t cause slower long-term growth but low national savings does tend to crowd-out investment.  As Bruce Bartlett often notes, the failure to reduce government spending to pay for the Reagan tax cuts was a serious problem for their “save and invest” agenda.  I suspect most readers of the Wall Street Journal are already smart enough to reject the free-lunch version of supply-side economics.  I also imagine that they would appreciate a renewed integrity if the editorial pages simply admitted as much.  </p>
<p>Final note: <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2005/05/06/tax-politics">Henry Farrell</a> has a must see post on the politics of taxation with a wonderful caption of Homer Simpson as Karl Rove’s favorite voter.</p>
