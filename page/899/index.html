                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Regular readers might recall I frequently note that I’m not a huge fan of the Democratic Party – I generally lean toward Democrats, though, because it seems to me that Democrats are less obnoxious than the Republicans, and have been for a few decades.  One sign of being less obnoxious is following policies that make more sense.  Now, we can sit here and argue about one or another policy, but in the end, what matters are results.  (At least until Marketing blurs the picture.)  </p>
<p>Regular readers may recall I often look at different series – debt per capita, healthcare costs, whatever, by Presidential terms.  So in this post, I was planning to do the same with GDP per capita.  (I vaguely recall having a post in which I’ve looked at real GDP per capita growth already.)  But when I do something like that, there is invariably someone who doesn’t like the results and decides to blame the business cycle.  </p>
<p>The problem with the business cycle is that in some ways it makes sense to take into account recessions (or booms), and in some ways it doesn’t, when comparing growth across Presidencies.  Sometimes recessions (or booms) are inherited, and thus the President should not be faulted for a recession (or credited for a boom), but the President’s policies may exacerbate them or even create them.  Or, to put things another way… one bad year (or one spectacular year) may not be the President’s fault (or to the President’s credit).  So maybe knocking off the best and worst years of a President’s term is a helpful way to look at things.  (A President can inherit a recession, but if stagnation is still around after a year, something is seriously wrong, and there’s a good chance that something is the President.)  </p>
<p>The problem is that removing the best and worst year can be a real problem when a President served only three years, such as JFK, or worse, two years, such as Ford.  So instead of looking at administrations, this time around I’m looking at “full terms.”  For purposes of this exercise, say JFK &#038; LBJ served a full term from 1961 to early 1969, and Nixon &#038; Ford together served a full term from 1969 to early 1977.  </p>
<p>The Table below shows the annualized percentage change in real GDP per capita, the growth in the best year of a full term, the growth in the worst year of a full term, and the average of the annual growth when the best and worst years are left out.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdHCV4VHjfI/AAAAAAAAABo/jyTypoOt2gk/s1600-h/God+Punishes+Us+When+We+(Collectively)+Vote+Republican+Pic.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdHCV4VHjfI/AAAAAAAAABo/jyTypoOt2gk/s320/God+Punishes+Us+When+We+(Collectively)+Vote+Republican+Pic.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>From the table, we can learn a few things.  <br />1.  It doesn’t appear that leaving out best and worst years makes much of a difference. <br />2.  Growth rates in real GDP per capita tend to be higher under Democrats than under Republicans.  There were three Democrat administrations and five Republican administrations, and all three Democrat administrations were among the 4 fastest growth administrations.  All four of the slowest growing administrations were Republican.<br />3.  The Republican hero-worship of Reagan makes sense, in that he’s the only Republican under whom the growth rate was comparable the growth rate under Democrats.  Of course, he’s no JFK LBJ, but he’s probably within the margin of error of being Clinton and a bit better than Carter if one looks only at real GDP per capita and ignores such issues, say, debt.  <br />4.  When Republicans perform poorly, they don’t mess around.  Every Republican administration had at least one year of negative growth, and for all but one of the Republican administrations, real GDP contracted by more than 1% in the worst year.  By contrast, among Democrats, only Carter had a year in which real GDP per capita shrunk.</p>
<p>So what do we learn from this?  Well, either Republicans pursue policies that simply don’t work (assuming the goal is to make us all better off), or God really doesn’t like it when the President is Republican. </p>
<p>A few wrap-up details….</p>
<p>a.  I hope to find debt by calendar year data and have another post looking at growth of real gdp less debt per capita some time soon.  Regular readers may recall that here at Angry Bear we’ve had quite a few posts looking at deficits and growth rates, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/optimal-size-of-deficit.html">most recently this one</a>, showing that running big deficits is merely a way of postponing taxation and cutting growth in later years.  Accounting for deficits and debt will probably make a fiscally irresponsible President like Reagan look worse.<br />b.  data is from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SS_Data/Section7All_xls.xls">BEA’s NIPA Table 7.1</a><br />c.  For the umpteenth time I ask… why do those who claim they are pro-growth support policies which so obviously lead to slower growth?<br />d.  Don’t people who sell the American public on these silly policies bear some responsibility?  Its one thing when its done once, or twice.  But at some point, isn’t it fraud to push a policy that so obviously hurts most of us?<br />e.  As always, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants &#8217;em.</p>

<blockquote>The numbers in President Bush&#8217;s budget add up &#8211; arithmetically. If his assumptions come true, the deficit will evaporate in 2012. But there are a lot of ifs &#8211; if Iraq and Afghanistan cost only $50 billion in 2009 and nothing thereafter; if the president and Congress hold growth in annually appropriated domestic spending well below inflation; if they let the alternative minimum tax reach deeper into the middle class or raise taxes on others to prevent that; if Congress squeezes $66 billion (4%) from Medicare over five years. OK &#8230; William Gale of the Brookings Institution think tank &#8211; populated by deficit-fearing Democratic wonks who have been trying to find common ground with deficit-fearing Republican wonks &#8211; has been thinking a lot lately about the parallels between Mr. Bush on Iraq and Mr. Bush on the budget.  &#8220;The Bush administration&#8217;s two signature policies have been the war in Iraq and consistent pressure for tax cuts,&#8221; he argues. &#8220;On the surface, they look quite different and were advocated by different parts of the administration. Look a little deeper and some common patterns emerge &#8212; so maybe this says something about the principles or management style of the Bush administration.&#8221;  It is a provocative and illuminating exercise. Let Mr. Gale kick it off: The president took the U.S. into Iraq with &#8220;falsely rosy scenarios&#8221; about the post-Saddam landscape there, he says. Mr. Bush built his tax cuts in 2001 on a similarly unrealistic hope that the budget surplus was large enough to cut taxes without creating deficits.  Let us keep going. As Iraq proved different and more difficult than anticipated, and contingency planning was regarded by the Bush White House as a sign of weakness, rather than prudence, Mr. Bush vowed to &#8220;stay the course.&#8221; When then-Treasury Secretary Paul O&#8217;Neill and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan argued for &#8220;triggers&#8221; to undo tax cuts if budget reality didn&#8217;t match projections, the White House scoffed. Even when the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan drove spending on homeland security and the military far above projections, Mr. Bush didn&#8217;t revisit his fiscal strategy.  Smart critics, even inside the administration, were disregarded and shunned. (Gen. Eric Shinseki on troops levels in Iraq, Treasury Secretary O&#8217;Neill on deficits.) Only true believers remained to give the president advice. Eventually, Mr. Bush changed his team &#8212; hiring new secretaries of defense and Treasury &#8211; but too late to get credit from the public or to forge bipartisan consensus in Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>Say what you want about Paul O’Neill’s performance as Treasury Secretary.  While he was not Robert Rubin, the reason he was fired was that he refused to drink any more Kool Aid.  David finishes the parallel with:<br />
<blockquote>But look ahead, and there is an unwelcome parallel between Iraq and the budget. Current policy is unsustainable, but there is no easy way out. Extend the president&#8217;s tax cuts beyond their scheduled expiration in 2009 and 2010, and the fiscal hole is enormous. Let them expire, and the tax increases could derail the economy. Messrs. Baker and Hamilton had little apparent effect on the president&#8217;s Iraq policy. Maybe they would have better luck on economics.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK – James Baker and Lee Hamilton are not economists.  But they have been plenty of economists, such as William Gale, willing to offer their advice on fiscal policy.  If we had such a commission, would we have any more expectations that this President would pay any attention to its recommendations?  No – we have to bide our time for another couple of years until we have a real President in the White House.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>ON ABC’s <em>This Week</em>, the gang was debating whether rising inequality matters.  Robert Reich was saying yes and noted a self-deprecating joke where he and Shaq were standing on a basketball court – “the average man here is six foot two inches”.  This came right after George Will saying inequality was not that important.  Will tells his joke by saying “three men enter a bar – since one of them was Bill Gates, the average man in the bar is a billionaire”.  That works only if Mr. Gates was paying for the tab and writing big checks to his two champions.  </p>
<p>But didn’t <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/column/012103.html">Paul Krugman</a> tell the joke this way:<br />
<blockquote>A liberal and a conservative were sitting in a bar. Then Bill Gates walked in. &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re rich!&#8221; shouted the conservative. &#8220;The average person in this bar is now worth more than a billion!&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s silly,&#8221; replied the liberal. &#8220;Bill Gates raises the average, but that doesn&#8217;t make you or me any richer.&#8221; &#8220;Hah!&#8221; said the conservative, &#8220;I see you&#8217;re still practicing the discredited politics of class warfare.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that the <em>This Week</em> discussion had already noted that the real income of the median household has not risen even as the mean income has, one has to wonder whether Mr. Will was really paying attention or ever got the point of the joke that he botched.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/steyn/251601,CST-EDT-steyn11.article">Mark Steyn</a> spends most of his Chicago Sun-Times admitting he doubts Global Warming and talking about his credentials on this topic.  He undermines everything in his silly op-ed that came before with this:<br />
<blockquote>In the course of the 20th century, the planet&#8217;s temperature supposedly increased by 0.7 degrees Celsius, which (for those of you who want it to sound scarier) is a smidgeonette over 1 degree Fahrenheit. Is that kinda sorta staying the same or is it a dramatic warming trend? And is nought-point-seven of an uptick worth wrecking the global economy over?</p></blockquote>
<p>This 0.7 degrees Celcius over the past century seems to have been the latest <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/jonah-goldberg-on-economics-of-global.html">rightwing talking point</a>, but it omits the fact that 0.6 of this 0.7 has come in the last 50 years.  Steyn also tries to play economist on TV with his “wrecking the global economy” and this:<br />
<blockquote>And, in return for this meaningless gesture, American GDP in 2010 would be lower by $97 billion to $397 billion &#8211; and those are the U.S. Energy Information Administration&#8217;s somewhat optimistic models. And now Jerry Mahlman of the National Center for Atmospheric Research says &#8220;it might take another 30 Kyotos&#8221; to halt global warming: 30 x $397 billion is . . . er, too many zeroes for my calculator. So, faced with a degree rise in temperature, we could destroy the planet&#8217;s economy, technology, communications and prosperity. And ruin the lives of millions of people. Or we could do what man does best: adapt. You do the math.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steyn is referring to the EIA’s <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/press/press109.html">Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets and the Economy, October 1998</a>, which noted:<br />
<blockquote>The loss in GDP, plus the funds used to purchase permits internationally, represents the total cost to the economy. Over the period 2008 to 2012, the annual average total cost ranges from $77 billion (1992 dollars) to $338 billion, depending on the level of carbon reductions and the recycling assumptions. This cost is relative to a total economy of $7 trillion in 1996, growing to about $9.5 trillion in 2010, and about $11 trillion in 2020 (1992 dollars).</p></blockquote>
<p>Steyn is again reading from the standard rightwing talk points, which often omit the “plus the funds used to purchase permits internationally”.  Steyn is also suggesting that we have only two choices – ignore global warming or go with the Kyoto Protocol.  I would hope the debate would be more directed towards more efficient approaches to slowing the reducing the rate of global warming.  Economists often argue that we should weigh the benefits of reducing global warming – which recognizes that a warmer climate imposes costs on our productive capacity and our general wellbeing – against the costs of addressing this problem.  But for global warming deniers, their question seems to be “what costs on our productive capacity and our general wellbeing?” Let&#8217;s face it, Mark Steyn&#8217;s credentials to be an economist are zero.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/02/road-ahead.html">Greg Mankiw</a> reproduces what might appear to be a shocking document from the latest <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=7731&#038;sequence=0">CBO</a> report, which is entitled “Cumulative nominal percentage growth from 2006 level”. As you look at this graph, we should also read the accompanying text:<br />
<blockquote>After 2010, spending related to the aging of the baby-boom generation will begin to raise the growth rate of total outlays. The baby boomers will start becoming eligible for Social Security retirement benefits in 2008, when the first members of that generation turn 62. As a result, the annual growth rate of Social Security spending is expected to increase from about 4.5 percent in 2008 to 6.5 percent by 2017. In addition, because the cost of health care is likely to continue rising rapidly, spending for Medicare and Medicaid is projected to grow even faster &#8211; in the range of 7 percent to 8 percent annually. Total outlays for those two health care programs are projected to more than double by 2017, increasing by 124 percent, while nominal GDP is projected to grow only half as much, by 63 percent (see Summary Figure 1.). Consequently, under the assumptions of CBO&#8217;s baseline, spending for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will together equal nearly 11 percent of GDP in 2017, compared with a little less than 9 percent this year. Revenues are projected to increase sharply after 2010 given the assumption that various tax provisions expire as scheduled. In the baseline, total revenues grow by 9.2 percent in 2011 and by 7.5 percent in 2012, thereby bringing the budget into surplus. Beyond 2012, revenues are projected to grow at about the same pace as outlays (by roughly 4.5 percent a year), keeping the budget in the black through 2017 under baseline assumptions. Relative to the size of the economy, outlays are projected to range between 18.8 percent and 19.7 percent of GDP during the 2008-2017 period under the assumptions of CBO&#8217;s baseline &#8211; lower than the 20.6 percent average of the past 40 years (see Summary Figure 2.).</p></blockquote>
<p>Three observations here: (1) the rise in the share of entitlements as a share of GDP is not so great that we will see spending exceed 20% of GDP if the rest of this forecast holds; (2) letting the tax cuts expire will insure sufficient tax revenues to cover this rise in entitlement spending; and (3) figure 2 is probably a more meaningful measure as it plots spending and revenues as a share of GDP.  Figure 1 is odd in two respects – the focus on nominal increases rather than real increases and its insistence at showing the cumulative increase.  I guess the goal was more to shock the reader than inform the reader.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I think another graph might prove useful here – that being the cumulative nominal percentage growth from 1998 level in defense spending as reported by the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>. Our graph shows actual data from 1998 to 2006 and uses the CBO projections of GDP for 2007 and 2008.  I had to extrapolate defense spending by assuming that it will grow by 8% per year for the next two years.  Given that the President’s budget proposal calls for DoD spending to be over 17% higher in 2008 than it was in 2006 – my assumption seems reasonable if not conservative.  Now one might infer from the graph that the doubling of defense spending in a decade is, well, just shocking.  But this would represent an increase in the share of GDP devoted to defense where it would grow from 3.95% in 1998 to 5% in 2008.  Not as shocking – is it?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news/thousands_lose_jobs_as_michigan">Onion</a> pokes fun at Michigan’s labor market woes:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;This is a sad day for the people of Michigan,&#8221; Granholm said to a crowd of part-time reporters and former assembly-line workers Tuesday. &#8220;Our state has a long, hallowed history of unemployment, and with these closings, we have lost a vital part of our economic and social fabric.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While I bet many residents of Michigan will find this in poor taste, it seems <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGEyMzAxNDUzNjc1NThjNWJkZWY2MTJmMGUyZDQ4ZTk=">John J. Miller</a> of the National Review thinks this is funny.  </p>
<p>Had Mr. Miller done a little fact checking, he might have realized that the only way The Onion’s little joke makes any sense for a long history to be defined as the last six years.  Our graph shows Michigan’s and the nation’s unemployment rate from January 1997 to December 2006.  During Clinton’s second term, the state’s unemployment rate was below the already low national unemployment rate.  The state’s unemployment rate, however, rose even more than the nation’s during the 2001 to 2003 period.  While the nation’s unemployment rate has declined – Michigan’s unemployment rate has not.  </p>
<p>But you know – it does seem like a very long time since we’ve had a real leader in the White House.  Somehow, I don’t think this was Mr. Miller’s point.  But then what was his point?</p>

But hang on a second folks and let’s focus here:<br />
<blockquote>Q: does the Treasury tell him that more money is coming in than was lost to the tax cuts? <br />MR. SNOW: Well, I&#8217;m not sure &#8211; the whole point is that the tax cuts generate extra economic activity. All you have to do is &#8211; I would, if you want to <br />Q: That&#8217;s a separate issue. <br />MR. SNOW: Well, no, it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not a separate issue at all. What it says is when you have greater economic  <br />Q: If the economy is growing more, that&#8217;s one thing; but whether tax revenues are growing is a separate issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, it is not a separate issue.  The impact of a reduction in tax rates on tax revenues does depend on whether it increases economic activity and by how much.  The supply-side crowd wants you to believe that a 1 percent reduction in tax rates will lead to an increase in economic activity that is greater than 1 percent, which is a proposition that has been ridiculed by <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-years-plea.html">Andrew Samwick</a> and many other economists.  But let’s go further and stipulate that Bush’s fiscal game seems to be long-term stimulus, which means less national savings.  And that means less long-term growth, not more.  So Tony Snow has it backwards – the whole point is that fiscal irresponsibility generates less economic activity in the long-run.</p>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/does_tony_snows.html">Mark Thoma</a> who adds:<br />
<blockquote>Does the president continue to repeat this because (a) people are afraid to tell him the truth about tax cuts, (b) he&#8217;s been told the truth, but chooses to repeat the tax cuts pay for themselves mantra anyway, (c) it&#8217;s been explained to him, but he doesn&#8217;t get it, (d) he&#8217;s decided, as with other issues, that everyone else is wrong and only he sees the truth about tax cuts &#8211; they do pay for themselves despite evidence to the contrary, (e) someone he trusts, perhaps someone who has influence on who can access the president, is telling him that tax cuts pay for themselves and he believes it, (f) there&#8217;s an obscure model somewhere built with the intent of proving this that might, and only might, under the right assumptions, show this effect. That&#8217;s all that&#8217;s needed &#8211; some evidence somewhere no matter how flimsy &#8211; to sell the policy, a lesson learned in the run-up to the Iraq war, or (g) none of the above.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s it.  Nobel Prize winning economist Tony Snow who doubles as Bush’s press secretary has constructed some obscure model where reducing the national savings rate leads to more growth!  Someone call the American Economic Review so they might publish the Snow model.</p>

                                <p>The latest attempt by <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MmJiZDEyYzkxYWE0OWYxMWY4Y2ZjYzI2YmNmOGExMDE=">Jonah Goldberg</a> to do economics starts off with an obvious observation:<br />
<blockquote>Public policy is all about trade-offs. Economists understand this better than politicians because voters want to have their cake and eat it too, and politicians think whatever is popular must also be true.</p></blockquote>
<p>Never mind the fact that Goldberg lets Lawrence Kudlow oversea the usual National Review economic stupidity that pretends there is no law of scarcity.  But then his latest gets incredibly stupid:<br />
<blockquote>Earth got about 0.7 degrees Celsius warmer in the 20th century while it increased its GDP by 1,800 percent, by one estimate. How much of that 0.7 degrees can be laid at the feet of that 1,800 percent is unknowable, but let’s stipulate that all of the warming was the result of our prosperity and that this warming is in fact indisputably bad</p></blockquote>
<p>Well if average annual growth was between 2.9% and 3% per year, we are producing about 18 times what we produced a century ago.  Of course, that would grossly overestimate the increase in per capita income unless we had zero population growth for the past century.  But this is not why Goldberg’s op-ed was incredibly stupid.  He is assuming that there is some fixed temperature to GDP relationship.  In other words, it is not possible to alter how we produce goods so as to not cause global warming.  But his assumption sort of denies the possibility of improvements in technology that allow us to have more goods and a better environment.  But then – what would you expect from a National Review nitwit?  At least he understands the law of scarcity, which makes this op-ed a vast improvement over the usual nonsense from the National Review.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Thanks to one of our readers for letting us know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Instrumental_Temperature_Record.png">this graph</a> showing average annual global temperatures.  It does look like this average rose by 0.7 degrees Celsius over the past century &#8211; but notice something else that Mr. Goldberg failed to mention. In the last half century, the increase has been about 0.6 degrees Celsius.  Was Mr. Goldberg too stupid to check the data – or was he simply exhibiting the standard behavior of National Review writers who deem their readers to be stupid and worthy of being lied to?</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/wolfforum/2007/02/in_spite_of_eco.html">Martin Wolf</a> leads a discussion on the Economics of Climate Change.  Hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/global_warming_.html">Mark Thoma</a> for picking up on a suggestion from <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/wolfforum/2007/02/in_spite_of_eco.html#comment-60088170">Andrew Oswald</a> entitled the Global Warming Bond.  Mark notes:<br />
<blockquote>That&#8217;s a good trick &#8211; charging future generations to prevent environmental damage that would occur before they are born and then affect them. I wonder if we can get the unborn to pay us not to do other sorts of damage, kind of a protection racket. Pay us off in bonds or we&#8217;ll pollute this river!</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Senator <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N06252236.htm">Joe Lieberman</a> as well as a NY Times opinion piece today (behind the subscription wall) both have called for a war tax to fund the Iraq conflict and to have all Americans share in the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Now I am definitely of two minds here.  The economist in me says that whether or not we like to admit it, we are passing a de facto tax bill whenever we make an expenditure because even if we borrrow to fund the war effort, those bonds will have to be paid someday and it is tax receipts that will do it.  So if we don’t pay for the war today then our kids will do it later on – not something we ought to wish on them.</p>
<p>The political activist in me says no way do I want to pay for this war.  I was against it and the President lied to get us into it, all the while being cheered on by many who even today cant admit they were wrong.  Let them pay for it if they like it so much.  Add to this the injustice of proposing a broad based tax to pay for the war just after massive tax cuts benefitting the richest among us.  What that means at the end of the day is a massive shift in paying for the war – First make sure the rich get out from under and then stick it to everyone with a regressive tax like the one on phone calls proposed by the NYT opinion piece.</p>
<p>I have a better idea.  Since it isnt possible to target a tax on those who support the war, lets at least make sure it isnt as regressive as some of the proposals out there.  How about lets repeal Bush’s tax cuts on those who make more than, say, a quarter of million dollars a year?  And if Republicans and war supporters are more heavily represented in that group then that would be just little bit of cosmic justice wouldn’t it?</p>

                                <p>Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House ranks right behind Dick Cheney in the line of succession to replace George Bush as President.  So the fact that the Pentagon is providing her with a military jet in the same fashion that they provided the previous Speaker is no surprise.  Yet certain rightwingers – and a few other nuts such as Lou Dobbs – thinks this is a scandal, which is just stupid.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/09/us/politics/09pelosi.html?_r=2&#038;hp&#038;ex=1170997200&#038;en=180fe8f62263bb4e&#038;ei=5094&#038;partner=homepage&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">Carl Hulse</a> recaps this faux story noting Tony Snow calling this a silly story.  Hulse finishes his article with:<br />
<blockquote>Some Republicans were put off by the flight fight. “This is a bunch of baloney,” said Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois, who said he had flown on Mr. Hastert’s military plane. “Next week,” Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said, “we are going to steal their mascot and short-sheet their beds.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We also learned that some Congressmen were criticizing Pelosi’s love of chocolate. Maybe they should join her on her next flight to San Francisco so they can visit <a href="http://www.ghirardellisq.com/ghirardellisq">Ghirardelli Square</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Since the title of the piece by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020900432.html">Darlene Superville</a> (House GOP Blasts Pelosi for Plane Request) was a lie, her lead had to be dishonest as well:<br />
<blockquote>For most of the past five weeks, House Republicans could do little else but watch as majority Democrats passed major legislation without giving them a chance to propose changes or offer alternatives.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Democrats did pass major legislation – often with House Republicans voting for these bills.  And yes, they had opportunities to debate.  More than the previous Speaker allowed the minority party.  In fact, read further in this story and you’ll see:<br />
<blockquote>The Republicans&#8217; amendment to the alternative fuels bill amounted to a dig at Pelosi; it specifically mentioned passenger planes &#8220;capable of transcontinental flights.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait a second, didn’t she write that the Republicans did not have any chances of propose amendments? </p>
