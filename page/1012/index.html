                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I guess we can give thanks as we headed out on our commutes to friends and relatives that gasoline prices were not as high as they were two months ago.  Keeping in the spirit of the holidays &#8211; <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/11/windfall_profit.html">James Hamilton</a> declares the windfall profits tax proposal a real turkey as he links to <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2005/11/gasoline_tax.html">Arnold Kling</a> who summarizes a paper from <a href="http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-DP-02-12.pdf">Ian W. H. Parry and Kenneth A. Small</a>.  Their Does Britain or the United States Have the Right Gasoline Tax, which was published in the September 2005 <em>American Economic Review</em>, suggests that the UK should cut its gasoline tax in half, while the U.S. should double its gasoline tax.  The UK tax rate is around $2.80 per gallon, while the U.S. tax rate is around $0.40 per gallon.</p>
<p>Parry and Small note a variety of driving externalities including pollution and congestion costs.  They also note a Ramsey rational for using higher gasoline taxes instead of higher taxes on employment to fund government spending, which is interesting because the Bush Administration seems to think we can avoid tax increases on either gasoline or labor (or capital income) even as it has no other serious proposals to reduce the massive Federal deficit.  </p>
<p>Given my suggestion that a gasoline tax would be mainly paid out of economic rents from oil suppliers, I was curious as to the relative elasticities of demand and supply in the Parry and Small model.  While they provided various demand-type elasticities, their model assumed fixed supply prices.  In such a model, a higher tax would be fully reflected in the price at the pump with no effect on economic rents.  I guess some liberal politicians might suggest that they have overestimated the impact on prices by assuming a perfectly elastic supply response.  But let&#8217;s be clear &#8211; increases in gasoline taxes would raise the price to consumers, which is why it would tend to reduce pollution and congestion.  I also find it interesting that the British pay more in taxes for their gasoline than we do in total.  </p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
<p>Update: MovieGuy must have some devastating critique in store as he is inviting me to provide an update.  All I have for now are a couple of things.  One is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_tax">this</a> interesting discussion of fuel taxes in the UK, U.S., Canada, and China.  The other comes from one my <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gaspump.html">favorite sources</a> for the components of the retail price of gasoline, which reports that the average price was $2.90 per gallon in September and $2.72 per gallon in October &#8211; of which $0.44 was attributable to gasoline taxes.  But here is what I found really interesting.  The contribution from refinery margins dropped from $0.79 per gallon in September to only $0.41 per gallon in October.  In other words, rents for the refinery function dissipated rather quickly.</p>

                                <p>This has nothing to do with economics, nothing to do with politics, and only a little to do with Thanksgiving.  But that slight connection is enough of an excuse for me to recycle this old Angry Bear post.  After all, Thanksgiving makes me think about football season, and football season makes me think of&#8230;</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In today&#8217;s NYTimes, Cornell economist <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/24/business/24scene.html">Robert Frank</a> suggests that perhaps they didn&#8217;t.  He argument consists of two primary elements:
<ol>
<li>Since happiness seems to depend more on relative wealth (compared to one&#8217;s peers, for example) than absolute wealth, and since all of the wealthy are getting wealthier together thanks to the Bush tax cuts, having more money has not really made the wealthier any happier.</li>
<li>The budget deficits that the tax cuts caused have caused a) financial fragility, and b) cuts in government spending on things like medical research, homeland security, and transportation infrastructure.  These budget cuts hurt the wealthy disproportionately, simply because they have the most to lose.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have to say that I disagree.  True, the research shows that relative wealth seems to affect people&#8217;s well-being more than absolute wealth&#8230; but an important component of this is the trajectory of one&#8217;s wealth over time.  Rising income and wealth makes people happier.  And the wealthy in the US have certainly enjoyed rising wealth and income thanks to the Bush tax cuts.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is entirely possible that the tax cuts were large enough that the downsides of budget cuts are small compared to them.  The wealthy have the luxury of essentially insuring against such losses, minimizing their impact.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the possibility of financial crisis: I have yet to see an example of a country where the wealthy suffered more than the middle-class in a financial crisis.  Typically, the wealthy have enough resources to safeguard their assets from financial chaos, while the middle-class does not.</p>
<p>So while I would like to believe Frank&#8217;s argument, simply because it is so roguishly counter-intuitive, I have to confess that I am not sold.  I remain convinced that when the wealthy have lobbied for more tax cuts, they have done so because they are very well aware of their own self-interest.  And as they have received tax cut after tax cut over the past 5 years, they have benefited &#8211; just as they thought they would.</p>

<blockquote><strong>US manufacturing ‘undermined by skills gap’</strong></p>
<p>More than three quarters of US manufacturers say that a scarcity of skilled workers is holding back their business, according to a survey by the National Association of Manufacturers. The survey of 800 manufacturers showed that 68 per cent were experiencing a moderate skills shortage while 13 per cent said they were suffering a severe shortage.</p>
<p>The complaint comes despite heavy job loses in the sector in recent years and seems ironic in the light of the announcement by General Motors that it plans to cut payroll by 30,000. Since 1998 around 3.4m factory jobs have been lost in the US.</p>
<p>Paul Ashworth, an analyst at Capital Economics, said the apparent paradox reflected the changing nature of US manufacturing. “As global competition is intensifying, US manufacturers are having to migrate higher up the value added chain in order to survive,” he says. “The US is losing a lot of moderate or low skilled jobs but finding it hard to satisfy the growing demand for highly skilled technical workers.”</p>
<p>The National Association of Manufacturers says the problem has been heightened by the exodus of baby boomers from the workforce, a decline in the number of students chosing technical or engineering degrees.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Alas, the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/print?id=890450">news</a> is not about the House Republican leadership doing an about face and supporting an increase in the nominal minimum wage:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON &#8211; The House on Tuesday agreed to a $3,100 pay raise for Congress next year to $165,200 after defeating an effort to roll it back. In a 263-152 vote, the House blocked a bid by Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah, to force an up-or-down vote on the pay raise. Instead, lawmakers will automatically receive the raise officially a cost of living adjustment as provided for in a 1989 law that barred them from pocketing big speaking fees in exchange for an annual COLA.  Matheson was the only one of 434 House members to speak out against the 1.9 percent COLA, which will raise members&#8217; salaries in January. &#8220;Now is not the time for members of Congress to be voting themselves a pay raise. We need to be willing to make sacrifices,&#8221; he said. The vote came as the House debated a spending bill containing a provision to guarantee a 3.1 percent pay increase for federal civilian workers. The bill, which funds transportation and housing programs and Treasury Department agencies, was scheduled for a final vote later Wednesday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not that I’m opposed to allowing Congressional salaries to be indexed this way.  In fact, I agree with Tom DeLay:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a pay raise,&#8221; said House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas. &#8220;It&#8217;s an adjustment so that they&#8217;re not losing their purchasing power.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now if he would only use this same logic to the minimum wage!  More from <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_11/007622.php">Steve Benen</a> who is doing a very nice job of filling in for Kevin Drum.</p>

<blockquote>Despite clear evidence that the marginal rate cuts of the 1920s, ’60s, and ’80s (not to mention the 2003 tax cuts) led to higher revenues.</p></blockquote>
<p>In defense of Tamny, all he is doing is repeating claims from the likes of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/did-stephen-moore-sucker-kevin-drum.html">Art Laffer</a> and his <a href="http://www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/09-10-99.html">ilk</a>: <br />
<blockquote>But reductions of federal income taxes in 1924, 1926, and 1928 were each followed by an increase in federal revenues. To some, this seemed proof enough that a tax cut would or could raise the national income and thereby raise the revenue. </p></blockquote>
<p>Many U.S. students of economics can easily rebut the free-lunch supply-side spin regarding the 1981 tax cuts by simply looking at the evidence on Federal tax revenues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Note in particular that Social Insurance and Retirement Receipts increased by over 140% from 1980 to 1990 so all other taxes increased by only 81% in nominal terms. In real terms, tax revenues not including Social Insurance and Retirement Receipts rose by less than 18% even before adjusting for population increases. With a 10% increase in population, real tax revenues per capita excluding Social Insurance and Retirement Receipts rose by a mere 7% over the decade. Of course, one might ask with Social Insurance and Retirement Receipts rose by over 140% in nominal terms. One reason had to do with the payroll tax increase to pre-fund the Social Security benefits of the baby boom generation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or one could also simply compare the 3.5% per annum growth in real GDP from 1947 to 2000 (which Larry Kudlow often correctly notes) to the fact that real GDP growth was only 3.0% during the Reagan-Bush41 years.  As far as the 1964 tax cut, most macroeconomic discussions note the return to full employment from an increase in aggregate demand – a Keynesian effect and not a supply-side miracle.  Some macroeconomic textbooks go further to remind us that the fiscal stimulus got out of hand leading to the 1966 Credit Crunch as the Federal Reserve initially tried to offset the surge in aggregate demand.  The rest of this 1960’s with its acceleration of inflation is something the supply-side crowd chooses to omit. </p>
<p>So I’m not surprised that the Laffer crowd goes back to the tax cuts of the 1920’s.  But how would one characterize the macroeconomy of the 1920’s.  If you have read &#8220;Understanding the Supply-Siders&#8221; co-authored by <a href="http://econ.academic.claremontmckenna.edu/CV/twillett-cv.htm">this fellow</a>, you might characterize the 1920’s as being similar to the 1950’s – strong real GDP growth over the decade but plagued with a couple of recessions.  Steve Kangas has also compiled <a href="http://home.att.net/~Resurgence/HISTORICAL_ECONOMIC_STATISTICS.htm"> Historical Economic Statistics</a>, which provides such items as Gross Domestic Product (1929 Dollars) and Federal Receipts and Spending (Billions, 96 dollars).  I have graphed the 1919 to 1929 potion of both series.  </p>

<p>While real GDP grew by 44.4% during this ten-year period, it is interesting to note that real GDP growth was greater in the first half of this period (21.3% increase) than in the second half of the period (19.0%) – as it was the first half of this period that had the higher tax rates.  As far as Federal revenues allegedly rising from the tax cuts, our graph of real tax revenues show no such effect.  And yet, Kemp and Laffer claimed in their October 2000 Wall Street Journal op-ed that real revenues did increase.  It would seem that the supply-side crowd continues to repeat its spin even when it is not true.</p>

                                <p>Congressman Murtha was excellent on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10042399">Meet the Press</a> answering each question quite honestly:<br />
<blockquote>MR. RUSSERT: In hindsight, do you now believe your vote for the war in Iraq in 2002 was a mistake?<br />REP. MURTHA: Obviously, it was a mistake. I mean, all of us were misled by the information that we had.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it was the line of question that preceded this Q&#038;A that I found most interesting:<br />
<blockquote>MR. RUSSERT: You think we&#8217;ll be out of Iraq by the end of 2006?<br />REP. MURTHA: I think we&#8217;ll be out of there; if not completely out of there, we&#8217;ll be very close to being out of there. I think we could be out &#8211; yeah, I predict we&#8217;ll be out of there &#8211; it&#8217;ll be 2006.<br />MR. RUSSERT: By Election Day 2006?<br />REP. MURTHA: You &#8211; you have hit it on the head.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right!  We entered this war at a time of Karl Rove’s own choosing – and we shall exit this war at a time of Karl Rove’s own choosing.</p>

                                <p>Rumors of the housing market&#8217;s demise are probably premature.  </p>
<p>Yes, inventories are rising and price appreciation has slowed &#8211; and even some small price declines have been reported in Boston and anecdotally in San Diego.  Also activity has <a href="http://www.dqnews.com/RRBay1105.shtm">slowed</a> in some areas, like Northern California.  But overall, inventories are still in line with a healthy market (4 months of supply).</p>
<p>Interest rates are also rising, but purchase mortgage applications are <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/11/mba-mortgage-activity-steady.html">steady</a>.  And rates dropped last week for a 30 year mortgage; the first significant decline in over 2 months.</p>
<p>But there are hints that the long awaited housing slowdown has begun.  Anderson Forecast&#8217;s Dr. Thornberg <a href="http://www.edab.org/index.html?BODY=reports.html">wrote</a> in October:<br />
<blockquote>The best indicator that the party is starting to end will be a decline in overall market activity &#8211; slowing of total unit sales and build up of inventories. When inventories rise and sales start to fall this will spill over into price appreciation and construction within three to six quarters, and this is when the overall economy will begin to feel the pinch. Right now the market appears to be at a crossroads. According to the latest numbers available, market inventories in the state have almost doubled over the past six months and overall market activity has been flat albeit at a very high pace. <br />&#8230;<br />&#8230; things are clearly at a tipping point. And remember, while it is unlikely that nominal home prices will fall rapidly, that does not mean a cooling market will do little damage to the economy. A cooling market is characterized by a large drop in new building units, market activity, and refinancing activity, not to mention heightened foreclosure activity. A lot of the new jobs in those areas will suddenly start to disappear. And don&#8217;t forget those wealth effects. When consumers realize they can no longer expect that appreciation bonus to subsidize their consumption habits, they will very likely pull back on spending. Keep an eye out.</p></blockquote>
<p>  The most immediate impacts of a housing slowdown on the economy will be the loss of equity extraction (The Home as &#8216;ATM&#8217;) and the loss of real estate related jobs.  I will revisit the impact of the loss of equity extraction and the &#8220;wealth effect&#8221; in the near future.  <strong>ADDED:</strong> on equity extraction, a funny photo from Mark Thoma: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/11/the_consumption.html">The Consumption Boom</a></p>
<p>For jobs, my blog has excerpts from <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/11/housing-and-employment.html">four stories</a> on housing and employment.  </p>
<p>And that brings me to California&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Empire_(California)">Inland Empire</a>.</p>
<p>Of all the areas experiencing a housing boom, the areas most at risk have had the greatest increase in real estate related jobs.  These jobs include home construction, real estate agents, mortgage brokers, inspectors and more.  The following graph uses NSA construction jobs for comparison purposes. </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, California has become more dependent on construction than the rest of the country, and construction has really boomed in San Diego.  But San Diego has nothing on the Inland Empire.  </p>
<p>I believe that areas like the Inland Empire will suffer the most when housing activity slows.</p>

                                <p>Actually, I suspect that <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/murray200511160844.asp">Iain Murray</a> failed to read the post by <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/11/gas-tax-redux.html">Andrew Samwick</a> before Iain wrote:<br />
<blockquote>The aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita have proved a massive breeding ground for what former OECD Chief Economist David Henderson has termed &#8220;Do-it-Yourself Economics&#8221; (DIYE), which he defines as &#8220;firmly held intuitive economic ideas and beliefs which owe little or nothing to textbooks, treatises or the evidence of economic history.&#8221; … The reason for keeping the price high, the Times asserts, is twofold: to defund the paymasters of terrorism in the Middle East and to combat global warming.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Samwick, however, pointed out two papers by Professor Jayanta Sen.  One addressed <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=809466">global warming</a> and the <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=792304">other</a> suggested:<br />
<blockquote>A buyer&#8217;s cartel could be formed by the governments of the major oil importing countries like the U.S., Japan, Germany, China, India etc. All oil sold in these countries would have to pass through the buyer&#8217;s cartel. The buyer&#8217;s cartel could negotiate a price with the oil exporting countries, say $10 a barrel (which should be a sufficient markup over production costs). After purchasing oil from the producing countries, the buyer&#8217;s cartel would release the oil in the market and let demand determine the price. If current demand conditions remain unchanged then the price would still remain at $65. However, this would reduce the effective price to the citizens of the importing countries to $10 a barrel as their governments would earn a profit of $55, which could be used to reduce taxes or pay for programs like Social Security. For the U.S. (which imports 10 million barrels a day) the savings would be $55 x 10 million x 365 = $200.75 billion a year.</p></blockquote>
<p>The National Review is so used to writing Do-It-Yourself-Economics, they fail to realize the fact that Dr. Samwick was referring to the writings of an economist at Ohio University.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.dccc.org/stakeholder/archives/003927.html">Jesselee</a> captures Congresswoman&#8217;s Jean Schmidt&#8217;s comments in full.  Let&#8217;s focus on one sentence each from her original rant v. her retraction.</p>
<p>From the rant:</p>
<blockquote><p>He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do.</p></blockquote>
<p>From the retraction:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Speaker, my remarks were not directed at any member of the House and I did not intend to suggest that they applied to any member.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Murtha IS a member of the House.  Too bad Ohio&#8217;s second district did not send that other Marine to Congress.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: Thanks to AB reader JP for pointing out <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/11/18/iraq.plan/index.html?section=cnn_latest">this story</a>:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8211; The top U.S. commander in Iraq has submitted a plan to the Pentagon for withdrawing troops in Iraq, according to a senior defense official. Gen. George Casey submitted the plan to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. It includes numerous options and recommends that brigades &#8211; usually made up of about 2,000 soldiers each &#8211; begin pulling out of Iraq early next year.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there we have it – the whole furor over Murtha’s proposal was a smoke screen.  The Bush Administration wants to pull the troops home in time for our November 2006 election, but they wanted it to appear to be their idea and not a proposal from the Democrats.  Will the Iraqis be able to maintain order in their nation within a year?  Not likely.  So by his own logic, George W. Bush intends to “cut and run”.</p>
