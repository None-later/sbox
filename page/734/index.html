<blockquote><p>In the stampede of instant experts unveiling their Pakistani solutions-in-a-box, some contributions are worthy of special attention.</p></blockquote>
<p>Instant experts on Pakistan.  I wonder if who those might be.</p>
<p>In an unrelated story, here&#8217;s what I see under a heading entitled &#8220;AT WAR&#8221; and a subheading entitled &#8220;Pakistan&#8221; right at this moment:</p>
<blockquote><p>JONATHAN FOREMAN: While Benazir took her courage too far in the pursuit of her political dream, the only parties we should blame for her death are the terrorists who actually killed. <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=M2Q1NGMwY2FjODM5MWQ2NTE2OTk4ZTE2YTNlZjc2ZGQ=">“Questions of Blame”</a> 12/28 10:11 AM</p>
<p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: Lost in all the frenzied reaction to the Bhutto assassination is any consistency of critique. <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YWRkZDQxNzE1N2FiZmVjZTI5Nzk1ZjFkYTU0YmNmYmE=">“Pakistani Punditry”</a> 12/28 9:43 AM</p>
<p>STANLEY KURTZ: Polling data may show support for Bhutto, but it’s not because of her strong anti-terror position, but in spite of it. <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=M2VkZWFiYmIzZmY2NWZhZDZmZDQ3NGRhYjhiNGFlMjc=">“Democracy in Pakistan”</a> 12/28 11:30 AM</p>
<p>RICH LOWRY: Upon her return, she was a frank voice against Islamism. <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NmJjZjdlN2UwZGVhNzliMDhhMjVjOWNmMjY5YjI0NmY=">“When an Assassin Succeeds”</a> 12/28 12:00 AM</p>
<p>MONA CHAREN: Now, at last, and perhaps just in time, the campaign season will get serious. <a hre="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGU0NzAzNTQ5ZjFmMDI4YmM0ZDIxZWE2NjRjZmQxZmU=">“The Real World Intrudes”</a> 12/28 12:00 AM</p>
<p>ANDREW C. MCCARTHY: If you really want democracy and the rule of law in places like Pakistan, you need to kill the jihadists first. <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MTExNmE0MzY3YjBlYWEwZDkzOThkMWJiM2JmZGQ2NDE=">“Benazir Bhutto”</a> 12/27 1:20 PM</p>
<p>AN NRO SYMPOSIUM: Jonathan Foreman, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, Victor Davis Hanson, Stanley Kurtz, Bill Roggio, and Henry Sokolski react to Bhutto’s murder. <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YzY3MDY5YTJkMTliODQ1NjJhZDgxODliNWZjMTg0Yzc=">“After Bhutto”</a> 12/27 11:40 AM</p>
<p>MARK STEYN: Benazir Bhutto&#8217;s return to Pakistan had a mad recklessness about it which gives today&#8217;s events a horrible inevitability. <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTYyZDM1ZTJiYTEzMzM2ZDZjNTAxZWQ3MzMzODBmOTg=">“Benazir Bhutto”</a> 12/27 10:10 AM</p></blockquote>
<p>Irony died long before Benazir Bhutto did.</p>

                                                                    </div>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>In a surprise move late this week President Bush vetoed the Defense authorizations bill.  First a little civics lesson.  The way funding is performed in today&#8217;s federal government  it takes two bills.  First is an authorization to spend which usually sets goals and limits on an agency&#8217;s spending (i.e. raises for employees, amounts for construction, research, operations, etc.) and some instructions on priorities how that authorization is to be spent.  Second, a bill is passed, the budget, which funds those authorizations.  Essentially congress has two swipes at effecting how and how much money is spent.</p>
<p>The current authorizations bill included a poison pill effecting and even eliminating some spending BY THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT.  Huh, you might say?  US authorizations stop Iraqi from spending?  What was included was a hidden little set of clauses authorizing plaintiff&#8217;s trial lawyers to impound Iraqi bank accounts.  </p>
<p>File a law suit against the Iraqi government or official and the first motion could be to impound ALL/ANY bank accounts.  Thusly, all Iraqi accounts could be locked up tight by a US Court just by request of a plaintiff&#8217;s lawyer(s).  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s just one potential impact.<br />
<blockquote>By the way, the real question is what account is those  billions of Iraqi dollars in?  That provision would terminate the arms purchases thru FMS with the<br /> first lawsuit. That would stop further arming of the ISF with Iraqi money. The end of the Iraqi military surge.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this comment explains some of the motivation. <br />
<blockquote>Theres (sic) a lot more  sneaky stuff here than meets the eye. What this little jem (sic) did was to allow Iraqi assets to be frozen by trial lawyers sueing (sic) Iraq for the actions of Saddam Hussein. The back door effect would be that Iraq<br /> would be strapped for cash, pull all of their money out of American banks, and it would probably put a financial stop to the rebuilding progress, in effect taking money away from the war effort. This is in effect, a back door effort to cut off funds for the war because if you take away all of Iraqs (sic) money, there would be no money available for our forces rebuilding that country. The dhims knew exactly what they were doing here and this amendment was never made know to anyone befor (sic) the bill was submitted.</p>
<p>By the way, this bill was submitted late on a friday (sic)night and voted for on saturday (sic) afternoon. I seriously doubt anybody really knows everything in it.</p></blockquote>
<p>More information is available at <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/016465.php#comments">Captain&#8217;s  Quarters.</a>  Read the comments for a lively discussion countering the good Captains opinion.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This one was by CoRev.  </p>
<p>Cactus here.  A few comments &#8211; based mostly out of ignorance:</p>
<p>1.  I figured foreign countries are generally exempt from lawsuits in US courts&#8230; except when by some action they are not.  An example would be how Libya was slapped with a huge judgment in a US court over the plane that went down in Lockerbie, for example.  And <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_12/012797.php">Steve Benen</a> links to <a href="http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/printedition/2007/12/29/bush1229.html">an AP report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sovereign nations normally are immune from lawsuits in U.S. courts. An exception is made for state sponsors of terrorism, and Iraq was designated such a nation in 1990. After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, however, Congress passed a law and Bush issued a decree stating that Iraq was exempt from such lawsuits.</p></blockquote>
<p>The subject of intent that often comes up in situations like this&#8230;  If the Republican Congress and the Republican President had intended for a post-Saddam Iraq not to be liable for such suits, they either would have written that into the law in the first place, or they would have changed the law in the years following his fall before the Dems took over.  </p>
<p>Update&#8230; On a re-reading of this point, it is clear I misunderstood the quote I provided.  My bad.  My point number 1 is moot.</p>
<p>2.  The <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071228/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush;_ylt=Al_Uedok0ZYpijyKNxH8p12s0NUE">AP also reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bush&#8217;s decision to use a pocket veto, announced while vacationing at his Texas ranch, means the legislation will die at midnight Dec. 31. This tactic for killing a bill can be used only when Congress is not in session.</p>
<p>The House last week adjourned until Jan. 15; the Senate returns a week later but has been holding brief, often seconds-long pro forma sessions every two or three days to prevent Bush from making appointments that otherwise would need Senate approval.</p>
<p>Brendan Daly, spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said, &#8220;The House rejects any assertion that the White House has the authority to do a pocket veto.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Put another way&#8230; if you can only use a pocket veto when Congress is not in session, and Congress has remained in session, the pocket veto does not apply.  GW was very good about sticking to the letter, if not the intent of the law, when it came to recess appointments.  Dems began to play the same game.  And now GW wants to play the intent rather than the letter of the law?  </p>
<p>3.  Leaving aside any issues of illegality or whatnot &#8211; this is an administration that cared so little about US taxpayer money that it lost track of billions of dollars of reconstruction money in Iraq.  It cared so little about US lives that it lost track of tons of explosives and who knows how many weapons that could be used against US troops.  But it seems plenty concerned about money being made available for the members of the Iraqi government (those paragons of honesty and virtue) to loot.</p>

                                <p>I once had a post comparing the the Euro (one currency, multiple countries with different economies) to the dollar (one currency, multiple states with different economies) and concluded that for such a situation to be stable, you need to see transfers to the lousy performing states from the well performing states.  And we do see such transfers.  (Interestingly, for decades, on average, it seems the lousiest performing states are among the reddest of the red states, inhabited by people who rail against welfare.)  </p>
<p>I was thinking of that yesterday when I read this interesting <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/12/is-future-of-euro-in-doubt.html">Yves Smith&#8217;s</a> post on the future of the Euro.  And I&#8217;ve been trying to think what to add to it &#8211; some pithy comment or whatnot instead of just a link &#8211; but after 24 hours I&#8217;m giving up.  Click the link.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Role of Expected Price Appreciation in Housing Prices</p>
<p>U.S. home prices are declining, putting considerable strain on the economy.  Much of the blame is focused on &#8220;reckless&#8221; financial institutions.  But what has been the role of the public (or free market) in driving housing assets up to, in retrospect, unsustainable levels?</p>
<p>Up to now the price of a house has been made up of two components:</p>
<p>1)  Shelter  Value  (tax adjusted mortgage (ownership) payment vs. comparable rental payment)</p>
<p>2)  Investment Value  (price appreciation)</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/business/2007_BUYRENT_GRAPHIC.html">Here</a> is a model that illustrates the effect of these two components on House price.</p>
<p>Note:  There are many Rent vs. Buy models out there.  I chose this one because 1)  It&#8217;s from the New York Times and 2)  It&#8217;s so easy, visual, and fun.</p>
<p>O.K.  Real World inputs.  I currently rent a condo with a market value of $400,000 for $1250 per month (Portland OR).  I used 0% rent increase as my assumption. Feel free to use your own.</p>
<p>Plugging these figures (shelter value) along the top, and adjusting expected appreciation (investment value) with toggle on the left yields the following results:</p>
<p>1)  At 10% expected price appreciation buying is better than renting after 1 year</p>
<p>2)  At 5% expected price appreciation buying is never better than renting</p>
<p>3)  You don&#8217;t even want to know what happens below 5%, (but toggle the arrow anyway)</p>
<p>4)  Reverse mojo, assuming 0% price appreciation (pure shelter value) a fair price for the condo is $165K  (&#8220;Buying better than renting after 10 years&#8221;)</p>
<p>Buyers, sellers, investors use some form of this calculation in their decision making process.  It was &#8220;Appreciation Crowd Mania&#8221; that drove home prices up.  The screwy lending, relying on historical loss data, just followed.  Now the crowd mania, as is want to do, is reversing.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This one was by Sammy.</p>
<p>Cactus here&#8230;  I agree with Sammy.  I have no doubt that home buyers and lenders both drove up prices together.  I will say this&#8230;.</p>
<p>1.  Presumably, the lenders &#8211; financial institutions &#8211; were more financially savvy than most buyers<br />2.  When the bail-out comes, I expect the lenders to do better than the buyers from it</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s With All the Shock and Surprise?</p>
<p>Is it just me, or was the assassination of Benazir Bhutto if not a foregone conclusion, at least an extreme likelihood?</p>
<p>In listening to the news over the past couple of days, the elements of shock and surprise had seemed to dominate the coverage.  I have no idea why anybody would be surprised at this outcome, at least not anyone who has even casually followed the news in Pakistan and similar countries.</p>
<p>So my question is, the moment that Ms. Bhutto started up the steps into the airplane taking her back to Pakistan, was anyone planning what they would do in the event of her death?  If not, why not? </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This was by Noni Mausa.</p>
<p>And now, a word from our sponsors&#8230; or rather, from me, cactus.  From what I could tell about Pakistan and the folks running the show over there, the administration bet all its money on two kleptocratic ponies in the Pakistani Stakes.  One is now dead.  My experience growing up in South America tells me that its not a bad thing if the death of a kleptocrat robs an uninformed American president of the opportunity to further alienate the locals &#8211; the fact that he (or she, as the case may be) is &#8220;our son of a bitch&#8221; is something remembered by the locals long after that son of a bitch kicks the bucket and is no advancing what an uninformed President perceives US interests to be in the very short term. </p>
<p>Having observed ham-handed American foreign policy through something resembling local eyes, I will only add this:  I won&#8217;t be at all surprised if it turns out that money we gave by the sackful to one of our pet kleptos was used for the funding, training and planning of the operation that killed another.  The process is helped along by the complete obliviousness of our folks who physically hand over the cash.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>At last <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/opinion/28krugman.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">Krugman</a> acknowledges that there has been a massive shift of jobs to low-income third world countries.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Since then, however, the sources of our imports have shifted to Mexico, where wages are only 11 percent of the U.S. level, and China, where they’re only about 3 percent or 4 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>As usual, Krugman fails to mention to that many of these countries have no labor protection, no right to bargain collectively&#8230;that they have become de facto awash in sweat shops, many of which our own companies happily use.</p>
<p>Nary a peep is heard from Krugman on this score. Instead, he seems to think that the poor in China and Mexico now have hopes of climbing the ladder. I guess that explains all the illegal Mexican immigrant labor. NAFTA must be a success sorry, Paul? Sorry, but there is no hope until labor is protected.</p>
<p>Krugman thinks that highly skilled jobs are staying in the states. Oh? He cites North Carolina and Lenovo. Is that it? Research centers are cheaper in China and India. Even the prestigeous scientific journal Science has acknowledge that fact.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beijing&#8211;With China emerging as a world research power, top AAAS officials and their Chinese counterparts signed a series of cooperative agreements that could serve as the foundation for future collaborations on a range of scientific issues.<br />&#8211;October, 2007</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only highly skilled jobs staying in the states are those of bankers and investors, for now. With the rise of Sovereign Wealth Funds and state sponsored capitalism, the bankers and investors are surrendering, inch by inch, their corner of the world. But that is another story.</p>
<p>Look, when trade agreements are made with countries that have no labor rights, whose entire history has been the systematic repression of those right, what do you expect? You think that the repressive Chinese regime is about to surrender power? That they will not use its vast labor force to enrich itself and its collection of cronies?</p>
<p>The &#8220;contract agreement&#8221; China enacted last May is already in shambles. State owned, state directed banks, investment firms and corporations? You think that these entities will be responsible to the vast Chinese underclass? How convenient it is to have a repressive government run the only union in the country. Where are the checks and balances? Walmart is having a field day in China. [Maybe we should call it quits; announce the end to democracy; install a one-party dictatorship in the U.S.]</p>
<p>Sweat shops have proliferated because China looks upon its populace as mere cannon fodder in its effort to become a &#8220;frontier country.&#8221; According to He Chuanqi, who headed the research team of the CAS [the guys responsible for mapping China&#8217;s future], by 2050 there is a six percent <i>chance of China&#8217;s </i>minimum wage being $1,300/month, $15,600/year, $7.50/hour&#8211;in 2002 dollars! For a full discussion with links, see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/china-now-to-2100.html">here.</a></p>
<p>Come on, Paul. Think. Actually look at the facts. Stop creating straw men to attack. The problem is not protectionism but the lack of rules underpinning globalization: The failure to ensure labor&#8217;s right to bargain collectively, to name just one.</p>
<p>If you continue to ignore some very unpleasant realities, if you refuse to understand the repressive regimes you now celebrate, if you refuse to address issues involving labor, then protectionism is what you will get.</p>
<p>Finger wagging? Yeah, right at you, Paul.</p>

I will, however, excerpt a paragraph and the footnote that goes with it, which are not the main points of his post but I think make interesting points by themselves:  </p>
<blockquote><p>If we could have predicted to 1968-Americans that 25% of 2007-Americans would get by below a realistically set poverty line (based on a varied market basket instead of a single-factor formula*) &#8212; further, that 25% of Americans&#8217; wages would sink below LBJ&#8217;s ($9.50/hr adjusted) minimum wage &#8212; what could they have guessed: that a mini ice age, a limited nuclear exchange followed by a mini ice age (nuclear winter), or multiple depressions or even tsunamis would bring American (not European) employees low?</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>
<blockquote>[ * 12.5% of American incomes are officially reported below today&#8217;s, decades irrelevant, federal poverty standard: three times the price of the cheapest emergency diet &#8212; dried beans only please, no canned! &#8212; try the 2002 book Raise the Floor for realistic poverty parameters. ] </p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t checked the figures, but assuming they&#8217;re right&#8230; it kind of sucks, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

But I&#8217;m going to touch on two of my favorite topics which also happen to be two of the more controversial topics I&#8217;ve touched on over the past year.</p>
<p>Consider&#8230;  economic theory says that you can move the economy through fiscal or monetary policy.  So let&#8217;s put together a simple model based on that.  We&#8217;re going to look at real GDP per capita from BEA&#8217;s NIPA <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">Table 7.1</a>.  To avoid issues of non-stationarity, we&#8217;ll try to explain the percentage change in real GDP per capita.</p>
<p>Monetary policy &#8211; I like real M2 per capita better than other measures like, say, nominal interest rates.  We can get monthly M2 from the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/hist/h6hist1.txt">Fed</a> going back to 1959, monthly CPI from the <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">BLS</a>, and quarterly population figures which, like the real GDP per capita, comes from.  </p>
<p>I use the March M2 figures for Q1, June M2 figures for Q2, etc.</p>
<p>Fiscal policy &#8211; I&#8217;m going to use short-hand, and simply create a dummy variable, equal to 1 if the President is a Dem and equal to 0 if the President is a Rep.  For those quarters in which there&#8217;s been overlap (e.g., Q1 of 2001), I go with the party of the new President since he is in office for the greater part of the quarter.</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s the model:  <br />% change in real GDP per capita  = B0 + B1 * % change in real M2 per capita + B2 * Party Dummy</p>
<p>Since the dependent variable is a percentage change, we don&#8217;t expect a particularly strong fit &#8211; we&#8217;re more concerned with the signs and significance of the variables.</p>
<p>Here we go:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R3QbpPy-qrI/AAAAAAAAA7U/LNUHwhegOX0/s1600-h/%25+change+in+real+GDP+per+capita,+dem+pres,+%25+change+in+real+m2+per+capita.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R3QbpPy-qrI/AAAAAAAAA7U/LNUHwhegOX0/s320/%25+change+in+real+GDP+per+capita,+dem+pres,+%25+change+in+real+m2+per+capita.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Its a dumb little model, but it indicates that the MS is significant.  And the President&#8217;s party is significant.  In fact, having a Dem in the White House is good for an extra 1.1% growth in real GDP per capita.</p>
<p>The fit, frankly, sucks.  But then, we didn&#8217;t expect much &#8211; its a toy model with only two variables, and anyway, explaining a variable that is a percentage change generally is a pain anyhow.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s see what we can do with this simple model.  Let&#8217;s lag the 1 year % change in real M2 per capita by a quarter.  Put another way&#8230; let&#8217;s see if we can assume that the Fed doesn&#8217;t react to changes in the economy as much as it leads them.  </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R3Qcjfy-qsI/AAAAAAAAA7c/k14NgHofEgw/s1600-h/%25+change+in+real+GDP+per+capita,+dem+pres,+%25+change+in+real+m2+per+capita+t-1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R3Qcjfy-qsI/AAAAAAAAA7c/k14NgHofEgw/s320/%25+change+in+real+GDP+per+capita,+dem+pres,+%25+change+in+real+m2+per+capita+t-1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; the model&#8217;s fit rises a bit, the significance of the Fed&#8217;s behavior goes up.  So yes, it seems the Fed leads the economy more than it follows.</p>
<p>But is a 1 quarter lag the right lag to use?  I won&#8217;t go through a bunch of variations, but I found I got better results using a 3 quarter lag than anything else:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R3Qd5fy-quI/AAAAAAAAA7s/Qw_RO7ffPrg/s1600-h/%25+change+in+real+GDP+per+capita,+dem+pres,+%25+change+in+real+m2+per+capita+t-3.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R3Qd5fy-quI/AAAAAAAAA7s/Qw_RO7ffPrg/s320/%25+change+in+real+GDP+per+capita,+dem+pres,+%25+change+in+real+m2+per+capita+t-3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The fit of the regression is still not that great, but its respectable given that the dependent is a percentage change in something.  </p>
<p>And are the variables significant?  Well&#8230;  I&#8217;m not one to argue with a P-value of 8.81657298073407E-23.  (To those of you aren&#8217;t numbers people, the answer to the question &#8220;are the variables significant?&#8221; amounts to heck yes.)  The Fed tends to lead the economy by 3 quarters.  And Dem Presidents have produced faster growth.  (And <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_19.html">no</a>, the Fed isn&#8217;t exactly helpful to Democrats.)</p>
<p>So please, once and for all, can we stop arguing about whether these two factors matter?  I think a better use of our collective time, frankly, is explaining:</p>
<p>1.  Is it a good thing that the Fed is essentially leading the economy considering how partisan it is?  (Its pretty clear that Uncle Alan really didn&#8217;t like GHW or Clinton, but he bent over backward for GW.)  <br />2.  Why does the economy grow faster when Dems are in office.</p>

                                <p>Noni Mausa considers a hypothetical application for immigration.  I suspect her hypothetical candidate would get waterboarded.  (I&#8217;ve edited the piece very, very slightly.)</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Candidate for US Immigration &#8212; Report and Recommendations</p>
<p>Personal History<br />Applicant was born in a small town in the northern part of Israel. Neither he nor his parents are Christian, nor are they citizens of Israel. When he was a baby, his parents spent some time as refugees, returning to the area later.  The family seems quiet and sober.  In his early teens he ran away from his parents and was lost for a few days.  He showed no interest in his family&#8217;s distress when he was finally found.</p>
<p>Education and Job history<br />He included no educational transcripts in his application. He is mostly or completely illiterate.  Now in his early thirties, he is unemployed, though he may have worked in construction in the past. He lists no job references, and is unable or unwilling to account for his activities during the last ten years or so. His considerable ability as a lay-preacher seems to be his sole significant skill, but he has<br />not been ordained or studied theology.  Instead he preaches a mix of scriptural fragments and personal intuition. </p>
<p>Current Family Status<br />He is unmarried, and has no fixed address, no savings, and few possessions.  He does not speak any English, nor has he tried to learn it. His current activity as an itinerant preacher pays no salary, nor does he seem to be interested in gainful employment.  He appears to be supported in a haphazard manner by people who are impressed by his preaching.  He usually travels with a group of supporters, men who are also unemployed.</p>
<p>Criminal History<br />He has had minor run-ins with the law, but these may indicate greater potential for trouble. He has a history of disruptive, irrational behaviour, especially in church, where on one occasion he attacked the staff. Charges were not laid in this incident. He has done &#8220;faith healing&#8221;, has also stolen livestock and damaged crops and trees. He has shown no regret and has not apologized for any of these incidents. He is often found loitering in parks, but also spends a good deal of time in unpopulated areas. He sometimes goes without food for long periods, and reports vivid hallucinations and hearing voices during these fasts. He drinks alcohol in moderation. He has not been known to use any illicit or prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Recommendations<br />The applicant speaks no English, had an unstable upbringing, has no proof of formal job training or experience, has no financial resources, and shows no interest in fitting into the community or making amends for disruptive behavior. In our opinion, he is ill-suited for immigration to the USA — in fact, we have seldom seen<br />anyone less well suited. Obviously he has nothing to offer America.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
