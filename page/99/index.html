<p>Lost Output Over $3 Trillion And Rising </p>
<p>Still traveling, so just a quick post, but this really can&#8217;t be emphasized enough. Andrew Fieldhouse at the Economic Policy Institute <a href="http://www.epi.org/blog/failure-stimulate-recovery-costing-trillions/">reports</a> that the Congressional Budget Office now has cumulatively reduced its estimate of 2017 gross domestic product by 6.6% since the beginning of the recession in December 2007. As Fieldhouse points out, that doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but when it&#8217;s 6.6% of a $15 trillion economy, we are looking at about $1 trillion (with a &#8220;T&#8221;) of lost income in 2017. To put it another way, that is well over $3000 of income per person that year. That is on top of $3 trillion in potential GDP already lost since the recession began, according to Fieldhouse.    </p>
<p>The culprit, of course, is the lack of further stimulus to the economy. After the <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/05/on-the-inadequacy-of-the-stimulus/">totally inadequate</a> $800 billion stimulus package in 2009, we have had essentially nothing. At the end of 2011, Republicans <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-30/congress-passes-two-month-u-s-payroll-tax-cut-extension.html">had to be shamed</a> into approving a payroll tax cut they previously favored. Indeed, as Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institute and the Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute have pointed out, it is not the case that both parties are getting more partisan. As they put it, &#8220;Let&#8217;s just say it. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-30/congress-passes-two-month-u-s-payroll-tax-cut-extension.html">The Republicans are the problem</a>.&#8221; It is the Republicans in Congress who are blocking further stimulus measures. Electing a new Congress that will not pass a stimulus bill will cost Americans thousands of dollars out of their pockets.    </p>
<p>We are a long way away from <strike>George Wallace </strike>Will Roger&#8217;s famous claim that there was not &#8220;a dimes&#8217; worth of difference&#8221; between the two parties. </p>

                                <p>Thought <a href="http://esoltas.blogspot.com/2012/06/recession-and-extreme-poverty.html">this</a> one might be interesting. <br />Rdan</p>
<p>(posted by Robert Waldmann / commentary after the jump)</p>
<p>extreme poverty update <a href="http://esoltas.blogspot.it/2012/06/poor-and-getting-poorer.html">update:</a></p>
<p>I assume you have clicked the link.  I&#8217;m not going to snip and paste the graph. Go <a href="http://esoltas.blogspot.it/2012/06/recession-and-extreme-poverty.html">there</a> if you want to find out what I am talking about.</p>
<p>The rate of extreme poverty (income less than half the poverty line also called &#8220;deep poverty&#8221; and &#8220;severe poverty&#8221;) set a new record in 2010 for <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/all-time-record-level-of-severe-poverty.html">the second year in a row</a> (the record only goes back to 1975.  I don&#8217;t know why).</p>
<p>I have three thoughts.  The first (as in my old post) is that there is clear evidence that AFDC (pre-reformed welfare) had an important effect on deep poverty.  Since the Welfare reform bill of 1996, the rate of deep poverty and not so deep but still pretty damn bad poverty (50 to 75% of the poverty line) have diverged.  Both declined in the late 90s boom (which convinced people with short attention spans and no understanding of omitted variable bias that welfare reform was a great success).  Since 2000 the increase in deep poverty dwarfs the increase in not so deep but still pretty damn bad poverty.</p>
<p>Also note the late 70s.  This was a period of rapidly declining unemployment and high inflation.  AFDC benefits were not indexed to inflation &#8212; instead the dollar amount was adjusted by state legislatures or, quite often, wasn&#8217;t.  I think the divergence of the two rates which Soltas shows in the 1970s corresponds to real benefit levels in many states falling below half the poverty line.  I note before a commenter does that the change in the 70s is overstated as food stamp benefits, which are not counted in income for calculation of poverty rates, automatically increase as cash benefits decrease.  I note that the change due to the welfare reform bill of 1996 is, if anything, understated as the bill also included huge cuts to food stamps which accounted for much more of the forecast spending reduction than the change from AFDC to TANF.</p>
<p>Finally get this &#8220;Evan Soltas is a student at Princeton University, where he intends to major in economics. &#8221;  The guy hasn&#8217;t even officially chosen his major (he looks about 16 in the photo) !</p>

                                <p>Yves Smith, Matt Taibbi, and Bill Moyers talk on the financial <i>Follies of Big Banks and Government</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Matt Taibbi:<br />The question I wanted to ask is, was, really more about the criminality. I mean, none of the members in either the House or the Senate really got into the issue of all the different offenses that these banks have committed in the last few years. You know, or, an ordinary person, if he commits welfare fraud, never gets a food stamp again in his life.</p>
<p>So given that these banks have systematically and repeatedly committed fraud, repeatedly been caught, you know, in situations like Jefferson County, municipal bid rigging, why should we still give them billions and billions of dollars in emergency lending from the Fed, bailouts, all of this aid from the government? How come there&#8217;s no consequences for them and there are consequences for ordinary people?</p>
<p>Yves Smith: I would have asked questions more having to do with what&#8217;s the justification for complex banking at all? That why do we need, why shouldn&#8217;t banks be run on the utility basis? Why should we have people like Dimon and his, the members of the CIO unit, most of which he&#8217;s fired, what the justification for literally that hundreds of millions of bonuses were paid collectively to those people.</p>
<p>And now he says they didn&#8217;t know what they were doing. There&#8217;s no justification for this, the sort of level of compensation that we generally have on Wall Street. And I would like to see that myth starting to be punctured in more public places.</p></blockquote>

<div>The Court will announce its healthcare ruling on Thursday.  Tom Goldstein, founder of Scotusblog, said after this morning’s opinions were issued that, in light of the Court’s informal division-of-labor routine, and based on which justice wrote which of today’s majority opinions, it looks pretty clear that (as everyone has been predicting all along) Roberts will write the majority opinion in the healthcare case, possibly (Goldstein said) with assistance from Kennedy.  In other words, it’s likely that Roberts will write the part of the majority opinion that addresses the individual mandate and related penalty and that Kennedy may write the majority opinion on at least one of the other three issues in the case. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Interestingly, at least to me, veteran LA Times Supreme Court correspondent David Savage has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/health/la-na-court-final-20120625,0,1925650.story">an article</a> today in which he offers the possibility that—er—<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/06/linda-greenhouses-aca-litigation.html">I’m right</a>.  Here’s the relevant excerpt from Savage&#8217;s article:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The healthcare case has been fiercely debated as a test of whether Congress can require individuals to buy health insurance under its power to regulate commerce. Opponents have likened it to forcing Americans to buy <a href="http://www.latimes.com/topic/health/diets-dieting/healthy-diet-HEDI000014.topic" title="Healthy Diet">healthy food</a>, such as vegetables.</p>
<p>Lurking in the background is a way to decide the case on tax law grounds. No one can be prosecuted, punished or fined for violating the mandate. In fact, the word &#8220;mandate&#8221; does not appear in the law. In &#8220;practical operation,&#8221; the administration argued, it&#8217;s just a tax law.</p>
<p>If the mandate is really just a tax, that would be supported by the Constitution, which says Congress &#8220;shall have the power to lay and collect taxes … to provide for the common defense and general welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, in the end, the justices could agree the law&#8217;s required tax payments are constitutional, while also making clear the government does not have broad power to mandate purchases.</p>
<p>Late last year, Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, an influential appointee of President <a href="http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics/government/presidents-of-the-united-states/george-bush-PEPLT000857.topic" title="George Bush">George W. Bush</a> and a friend of the chief justice, wrote an opinion arguing for treating the mandate as a tax law, not a regulation of commerce.</p>
<p>During oral arguments in March, the conservative justices sounded highly skeptical of giving the government the power to mandate purchases. But at one point, liberal Justice <a href="http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/justice-system/sonia-sotomayor-PEPLT0000016163.topic" title="Sonia Sotomayor">Sonia Sotomayor</a>asked whether it would be constitutional for Congress to assess a tax for health insurance and include an exemption for everyone who had insurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government might be able to do that,&#8221; said Paul D. Clement, the lawyer for the Republican states suing to overturn the healthcare law. If so, the liberals asked, why can&#8217;t Congress require people to have private insurance or pay a tax penalty?</p>
<p>Having the law upheld on tax grounds would be a big win for the president.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>(In my June 15 post, I paraphrased Sotomayor’s question and erroneously attributed it to either Roberts or Kennedy.  I said I couldn’t remember which of the two had asked the question, which is no surprise since neither of them did.  Ah; I should have known.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now on to today’s big rulings.  The most significant—<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/25/politics/scotus-arizona-law/index.html?eref=igoogledmn_topstories">and it is huge</a>—is a <i>big</i> surprise.  In a 5-3 opinion (Kagan did not participate) written by Kennedy and joined by Roberts in <i>Arizona v.</i> <i>United States</i>, the Court struck down on “federal preemption” grounds almost all of the major provisions in Arizona’s stop/demand-citizenship-papers/detain-upon-suspicion-of-being-an-illegal-alien all Hispanic-looking-or-sounding-folks law.  “Federal preemption” is a legal doctrine, based on the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, that bars states from enacting laws that conflict with a federal statute or that intrude into a policy area in which the Constitution grants the federal government sole control (e.g., national defense and foreign policy) or in which a federal statute indicates Congress’s intent to make federal statute the sole arbiter in that area of policy. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>On the only remaining major provision—which appears to allow the detention by state prison officials of anyone arrested on other grounds, in order to allow the officials to verify the person’s citizenship—the Court rule that it is too early to know whether or not federal law preempts that provision, because the state courts have not yet “interpreted” it.  The opinion makes clear, though, that if the state court interprets the provision to permit a detention or an extension of a detention in order to enable the citizenship check, this provision, too, likely would be preempted.  And the opinion says explicitly that even if the state court interprets the provision narrowly enough to survive preemption on the grounds argued in this case, the provision may be preempted on other grounds or it may violate another provision of the Constitution.  In a separate lawsuit, the law is being challenged on Fourteenth Amendment equal protection (racial profiling) and due process grounds.</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/06/online-symposium-s-b-1070-rides-off-into-the-sunset/">Here&#8217;s</a> an outstanding discussion of the Arizona-statute opinion at Scotusblog.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>The other major ruling today in a fully briefed and argued case—two cases, actually; one from Alabama, the other from Arkansas—extended the Eight Amendment’s bar to cruel and unusual punishment to strike down as unconstitutional state statutes that mandate life imprisonment without possibility of parole when the statute is applied to minors.  This was a 5-4 opinion written by Kagan and joined by Kennedy.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the final ruling of broad significance, the Fab Five summarily reversed (i.e., without full briefing and oral argument) the Montana Supreme Court in the case in which that court had upheld the constitutionality of a longstanding Montana campaign-finance statute despite <i>Citizens United</i>.  I had called this one wrong in postings on AB, saying that I thought the Court would agree to hear the case, but a week ago I realized that I probably was wrong.  The Court had initially scheduled its decision for last Monday on whether or not it would hear the case next term.  When it put off its announcement until today, I knew what that meant.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The dissent, written by Breyer and joined by the other Dem appointees, says that while they had the minimum number of votes (four) to force full briefing and oral argument, the four decided not to do so because they recognized that there was no chance that any of the other five would vote differently if the case were argued.  I think the four should have forced full argument next term, not because there was a chance that one of the five would switch sides—there was not—but because this case would have educated the public about a critical fact that most of the public probably does not know: that in <i>Citizens United</i>, the 5-4 majority didn’t hold that the First Amendment speech grounds are absolute—a ruling that would have required them to expressly overrule the Court’s longstanding election-law precedents—but instead based its ruling on a “finding” of utterly fabricated and baseless <i>fact</i>.  The 5-4 majority simply declared, based on nothing at all, that they “find” that unlimited campaign “expenditures” by outside individuals, groups and corporations does not “give rise” to corruption or to the appearance of corruption.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Had the Court been forced to have a full hearing on the Montana case, complete with oral argument, the public would have learned that in election-law cases, this 5-4 majority simply fabricates facts and casually varies the standard under which the Court can strike down a statute as unconstitutional, depending on what is required for the majority rule in a way that (significantly) helps Republican candidates.  In <i>Citizens</i><i>United</i>, for example, the majority not only decided on its own to raise the issue of the constitutionality of the campaign-expenditure limitations in the McCain-Feingold law, a tactic that violates the Court&#8217;s own procedural norms and, in that instance, its own Article III &#8220;jurisdictional&#8221; precedents;* they also required that Congress have vast, specific evidence that unlimited expenditures cause corruption or the appearance of corruption, and then denied the government the opportunity to gather and present that evidence, instead simply coopting for themselves the writing of the “facts.”  Yet, in a case a few years ago that challenged the constitutionality of a state law that required a government-issued photo ID in order to prevent voter fraud, the 5-4 majority required no evidence whatsoever by the state that widespread voter fraud existed—and ignored the evidence that such voter fraud is almost nonexistent. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In my opinion, it is this aggressive but quiet altering of procedural and standard-of-review law in cases that could affect election outcomes, in a manner that baldly favors Republican candidates either directly or indirectly, that makes this 5-4 majority so dangerous.  But for the moment, I’ll rejoice in the outcome of the two opinions in argued cases that I discussed above.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And on Thursday, we&#8217;ll learn whether Savage and I are right or whether instead almost everyone else is.</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*The part of that sentence that reads &#8220;a tactic that violates the Court&#8217;s own procedural norms and, in that instance, its own Article III &#8220;jurisdictional&#8221; precedents&#8221; was added for clarity on 6/26.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2012/06/22/dont-believe-everything-you-read-dept-foreclosure-case-in-massachusetts-gives-new-protections-to-homeowners/">Via Firedoglake&#8217;s David Dayen</a> comes this post of the &#8216;ambiguity&#8217; of a State Supreme Court ruling on one case of foreclosure action and the requirements to &#8216;own&#8217; a property.</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on my conversations, the ruling does not allow Fannie Mae to foreclose. It remands the case back to the lower court for them to decide how to proceed. And while the case is prospective, meaning that it only applies to foreclosure actions from this point forward, as <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505247_162-57458916/mass-foreclosure-ruling-disappoints-advocates/">Adam Levitin explains</a> there are still some added protections for homeowners granted. In the case, Eaton v. Fannie Mae and Green Tree Servicing, the homeowner argued that a lender cannot foreclose unless they hold both the mortgage and the promissory note. And the high court in Massachusetts agreed with that.</p>
<p>Georgetown University Law Professor Adam Levitin, who wrote a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Eaton’s position, said the decision makes clear that lenders who do not hold both the mortgage and the promissory note do not have the right to foreclose, an area of state law that until now has been ambiguous.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s not an outright victory. The court was definitely concerned that if it applied the ruling retroactively, that it would cloud title for a lot of real estate in Massachusetts. They avoided that,” Levitin said.<br />“However, for people who are currently in foreclosure or worried that foreclosure will happen in the future, this rule matters quite a bit because the mortgage industry was, frankly, sloppy about its paperwork.<br />“If you lost your house in foreclosure, you’re not getting it back because of this, but overall, it means homeowners have pretty good protections, namely, you can’t be thrown out of your house unless the lender can absolutely prove they have the right to do so.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://stopforeclosurefraud.com/2012/06/22/eaton-vs-fannie-mae-massachusetts-supreme-judicial-holding-the-mortgage-and-also-either-holding-the-mortgage-note-or-acting-on-behalf-of-the-note-holder/">Eaton v. Fannie Mae</a> decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is not a huge banking industry win going forward. In fact, if the Legislature lets it stand, it’s a huge homeowner win. Forget the part about the decision applying in the future only; while I think it is wrong, it was doctrinally reasonable and arguably protects many innocent third parties.</p>
<p>Going forward, the really big deal is that the Court has taken the “show me the note” defense and made it “show me the note owner.”  </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Show me the note owner” is really hard to do in an era of mass <a href="http://abigailcfield.com/?p=882" title="Securitization Fail, What It Means If the Servicer Settlement “Cures” It &#038; Why NY Can’t Sign">securitization fail</a>. Securitization fail means the trust doesn’t own the loans. And if the trust doesn’t own the loans, then the servicer isn’t the agent of the note owner and can’t foreclose non-judicially. Moreover, as this Court’s earlier <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/46471786/Ibanez-Case"><em>Ibanez</em> decision</a> revealed, securitization <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/01/07/massachusetts-ruling-slams-bank-foreclosure-practices/" title="My take on Ibanez for DailyFinance">fail may have occurred more often in Massachusetts</a> than elsewhere.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Recently, Matt Stoller claimed Obama had a 61 vote majority in the Senate and enough to secure either Universal or Single Payer Healthcare. We all forget the one Senator from Aetna stand which killed any other options an Medicare for those starting at 55. President Obama did not have a filibuter proof 61 votes in the Senate for any other healthcare options muchless the ACA. The Blue Dogs (Nelson(s), Bacus, Bayh, Cantwell, Feinstein, Lincoln, Pryor, Widen, Conrad, etc) wouldn&#8217;t move for any healthcare plan unless they brought home the bacon as Nelson attempted to do for Nebraska. Just plain ordinary obstructionism to block whatever this President would attempt to do. Senator Lieberman killed anything beyond the ACA. </p>
<p>Former Editor of the New England Journal of Medicine and others should be sorry if the entire ACA is struck down or dismembered as we will go another decade before a President and a Congress take up the issue again and heathcare costs (for which healthacre insurance is a reflection) will again rise faster than inflation. Because of the power of Medicare, it has been able to rein in rising healthcare costs so far at less than 3% than that of the commercial market at about 9% %. <a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&#038;blobcol=urldocumentfile&#038;blobtable=SPComSecureDocument&#038;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3Ddownload.pdf&#038;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&#038;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&#038;blobkey=id&#038;blobheadername1=content-type&#038;blobwhere=1245335609391&#038;blobheadervalue3=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&#038;blobnocache=true" target="_blank">Standard and Poors Healthcare Economic Indices</a> .</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The last time healthcare reform was attempted was under Clinton and costs have increased multiple times. A failure to allow the ACA to go forward will allow the overall Healthcare Industry to again implement inflationary costs in a market which has no restraints. Certainly, I can not conjur up what SCOTUS will do. The kings in black robes will decide what is best for us as Congress lacks the will power to represent those who placed them there with the exception of ALEC, Koch(s), and Norquist.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Hi folks.  I have finally initiated the process to migrate to a word press platform from the blogger platform, and will be switching to another comment system to be determined.  Blogger is getting harder to use in our experience, and of course did not develop the variety of tools to augment how Angry Bear can offer a more systematic reference by topic access to archives and allow the opportunity for individual authors to discuss topics in  their own more personal styles on author pages.  All the attendant social media and subscription access will be modernized.</p>
<p>In the process the look and feel of Angry Bear will change to a more polished and better used &#8216;real estate&#8217;.  I personally do not like the narrow middle column (two sidebars) coming in use currently.  It is perhaps geared to mobile communications, but I feel detracts if you use a wider screen and data intense posts.  An e-mail subscription with a mobile look might be necessary.</p>
<p>Please leave suggestions for useful functions first, and then perhaps the look of your favorite sites. </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<p><strong>Is Barack Obama Morphing Into Dick Cheney?        <br />Four Ways the President Is Pursuing Cheney’s Geopolitics of Global Energy </strong>      <br /><strong><br /></strong><br />As details of his administration’s global war against terrorists, insurgents, and hostile warlords have become more widely known &#8212; a war that involves a mélange of drone attacks, <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175547/andrew_bacevich_the_golden_age_of_special_operations">covert operations</a>, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html">presidentially selected assassinations</a> &#8212; President Obama has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/02/drone-wars-secrecy-barack-obama">compared</a> to President George W. Bush in his appetite for military action. “As shown through his stepped-up drone campaign,” Aaron David Miller, an <a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/staff/aaron-david-miller">advisor</a> to six secretaries of state, <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/23/barack_oromney?page=0,0">wrote</a> at <em>Foreign Policy</em>, “Barack Obama has become George W. Bush on steroids.”</p>
<p>When it comes to international energy politics, however, it is not Bush but his vice president, Dick Cheney, who has been providing the role model for the president. As recent events have demonstrated, Obama’s energy policies globally bear an eerie likeness to Cheney’s, especially in the way he has engaged in the geopolitics of oil as part of an American global struggle for future dominance among the major powers.<br />More than any of the other top officials of the Bush administration &#8212; many with oil-company backgrounds &#8212; Cheney focused on the role of energy in global power politics. From 1995 to 2000, he served as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halliburton">Halliburton</a>, a major supplier of services to the oil industry. Soon after taking office as vice president he was asked by Bush to devise a new national energy strategy that has largely governed U.S. policy ever since.<a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="more"></a>  </p>
<p>Early on, Cheney concluded that the global supply of energy was not growing fast enough to satisfy rising world demand, and that securing control over the world’s remaining oil and natural gas supplies would therefore be an essential task for any state seeking to acquire or retain a paramount position globally. He similarly grasped that a nation’s rise to prominence could be thwarted by being denied access to essential energy supplies. As coal was to the architects of the British empire, oil was for Cheney &#8212; a critical resource over which it would sometimes be necessary to go to war.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>More than any of his peers, Cheney articulated such views on the importance of energy to national wealth and power. “Oil is unique in that it is so strategic in nature,” he <a href="http://www.energybulletin.net/node/559">told</a> an audience at an industry conference in London in 1999. “We are not talking about soapflakes or leisurewear here. Energy is truly fundamental to the world’s economy. The Gulf War was a reflection of that reality.”</p>
<p>Cheney’s reference to the 1990-1991 Gulf War is particularly revealing. During that conflict, he was the secretary of defense and so supervised the American war effort. But while his boss, President George H.W. Bush, played down the role of oil in the fight against Iraq, Cheney made no secret of his belief that energy geopolitics lay at the heart of the matter. “Once [Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein] acquired Kuwait and deployed an army as large as the one he possesses,” Cheney told the Senate Armed Services Committee when asked to justify the administration’s decision to intervene, “he was clearly in a position to be able to dictate the future of worldwide energy policy, and that gave him a stranglehold on our economy.”</p>
<p>This would be exactly the message he delivered in 2002, as the second President Bush girded himself for the invasion of Iraq. Were Saddam Hussein successful in acquiring weapons of mass destruction, Cheney <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/08/20020826.html">told</a> a group of veterans that August 25th, “[he] could then be expected to seek domination of the entire Middle East [and] take control of a great portion of the world’s energy supplies.”</p>
<p>For Cheney, the geopolitics of oil lay at the core of international relations, largely determining the rise and fall of nations. From this, it followed that any steps, including war and environmental devastation, were justified so long as they enhanced America’s power at the expense of its rivals.</p>
<p><strong>Cheney’s World</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br />Through his speeches, Congressional testimony, and actions in office, it is possible to reconstruct the geopolitical blueprint that Cheney followed in his career as a top White House strategist &#8212; a blueprint that President Obama, eerily enough, now appears to be implementing, despite the many risks involved.<br />That blueprint consists of four key features:</p>
<p>1. Promote domestic oil and gas production at any cost to reduce America’s dependence on unfriendly foreign suppliers, thereby increasing Washington&#8217;s freedom of action.<br />2. Keep control over the oil flow from the Persian Gulf (even if the U.S. gets an ever-diminishing share of its own oil supplies from the region) in order to retain an “economic stranglehold” over other major oil importers.<br />3. Dominate the sea lanes of Asia, so as to control the flow of oil and other raw materials to America’s potential economic rivals, China and Japan.<br />4. Promote energy “diversification” in Europe, especially through increased reliance on oil and natural gas supplies from the former Soviet republics of the Caspian Sea basin, in order to reduce Europe’s heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas, along with the political influence this brings Moscow.</p>
<p>The first objective, increased reliance on domestic oil and gas, was highlighted in <a href="http://www.pppl.gov/common_pages/national_energy_policy.html"><em>National Energy Policy</em></a><em>,</em> the energy strategy Cheney devised for the president in May 2001 in close consultation with representatives of the oil giants. Although mostly known for its advocacy of increased drilling on federal lands, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Cheney Report (as it came to be known) largely focused on the threat of growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil suppliers and the need to achieve greater “energy security” through a damn-the-torpedoes-full-speed-ahead program of accelerated exploitation of domestic energy supplies.<br />“A primary goal of the National Energy Policy is to add supply from diverse sources,” the report declared. “This means domestic oil, gas, and coal. It also means hydropower and nuclear power.” The plan also called for a concerted drive to increase U.S. reliance on friendly sources of energy in the Western hemisphere, especially Brazil, Canada, and Mexico.</p>
<p>The second objective, control over the flow of oil through the Persian Gulf, was, for Cheney, the principal reason for both the First Gulf War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Although before that invasion, the president and other top officials focused on Saddam Hussein’s supposed weapons of mass destruction, his human rights record, and the need to bring democracy to Iraq, Cheney never wavered in his belief that the basic goal was to ensure that Washington would control the Middle Eastern oil jugular.</p>
<p>After Saddam’s ouster and the occupation of Iraq began, Cheney was especially outspoken in his insistence that neighboring Iran be prevented, by force of arms if need be, from challenging American preeminence in the Gulf. “We’ll keep the sea lanes open,” he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/world/middleeast/11cnd-cheney.html">declared</a> from the deck of an aircraft carrier during maneuvers off the coast of Iran in May 2007. “We’ll stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating the region.”</p>
<p>Cheney also focused in a major way on ensuring control over the sea lanes from the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf (out of which 35% of the world’s tradable oil flows each day) across the Indian Ocean, through the Straits of Malacca, and into the South and East China Seas. To this day, these maritime corridors remain essential for the economic survival of China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, bringing oil and other raw materials to their industries and carrying manufactured goods to their markets abroad. By maintaining U.S. control over these vital conduits, Cheney sought to guarantee the loyalty of America’s key Asian allies and constrain the rise of China. In pursuit of these classic geopolitical objectives, he pushed for an enhanced U.S. naval presence in the Asia-Pacific region and the establishment of a <a href="http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/pacific-allies-aim-for-india-upgrade/story-e6frfkp9-1111113156335">network of military alliances</a> linking Japan, Australia, and India, all aimed at containing China.</p>
<p>Finally, Cheney sought to rein in America’s other major great-power rival, Russia. While his boss, George W. Bush, spoke of the potential for cooperation with Moscow, Cheney, still an energy cold warrior, viewed Russia as a geopolitical competitor and sought every opportunity to diminish its power and influence. He particularly feared that Europe’s growing dependence on Russian natural gas could undermine its resolve to resist aggressive Russian moves in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus.<br />To counter this trend, Cheney tried to persuade the Europeans to get more of their energy from the Caspian Sea basin by <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175123/ira_chernus_cold_war_s_ghost_blocks_mideast_peace">building</a><strong> </strong>new pipelines to that region via Georgia and Turkey. The idea was to bypass Russia by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/06/world/europe/06cheney.html">persuading</a> Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan to export their gas through these conduits, not those owned by Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled monopoly. When Georgia came under attack from Russian forces in August 2008, after Georgian troops shelled the pro-Moscow enclave of South Ossetia, Cheney was the first senior U.S. official to <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/30ff9d6c-7a9e-11dd-adbe-000077b07658.html#axzz1y4V7SV10">visit</a> Tbilisi, bringing a promise of $1 billion in reconstruction assistance, as well as an offer of fast-track entry into NATO. France and Germany <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/world/03nato.html">blocked</a> the move, fearing Moscow might respond with actions that could destabilize Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Obama as Cheney</strong></p>
<p>This four-part geopolitical blueprint, relentlessly pursued by Cheney while vice president, is now being implemented <em>in every respect</em> by President Obama.</p>
<p>When it comes to the pursuit of enhanced energy independence, Obama has embraced the ultra-nationalistic orientation of the 2001 Cheney report, with its call for increased reliance on domestic and Western Hemisphere oil and natural gas &#8212; no matter the dangers of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/business/deepwater-oil-drilling-accelerates-as-bp-disaster-fades.html">drilling</a> in environmentally fragile offshore areas or the use of hazardous techniques like <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175492/ellen_cantarow_shale-shocked">hydro-fracking</a>. In recent speeches, he has boasted of his administration’s efforts to facilitate increased oil and gas drilling at home and promised to speed drilling in new locations, including <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/30/nation/la-na-drilling-alaska-20120331">offshore Alaska</a> and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>“Over the last three years,” he <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/24/remarks-president-state-union-address">boasted</a> in his January State of the Union address, “we’ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my administration to open more than 75% of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now &#8212; right now &#8212; American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years… Not only that &#8212; last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years.” He spoke with particular enthusiasm about the extraction of natural gas via fracking from shale deposits: “We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years. And my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.”</p>
<p>Obama has also voiced his desire to increase U.S. reliance on Western Hemisphere energy, thereby diminishing its dependence on unreliable and unfriendly suppliers in the Middle East and Africa. In March 2011, with the Arab Spring gaining momentum, he traveled to Brazil for five days of trade talks, a geopolitical energy pivot <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/obama-visits-brazil-with-libya-on-his-mind/2011/03/20/ABZrNb1_story.html">noted</a> at the time. In the eyes of many observers, Obama’s focus on Brazil was inextricably linked to that country’s emergence as a major oil producer, thanks to new discoveries in the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/cabs/brazil/Full.html">“pre-salt” fields</a> off its coast in the depths of the Atlantic Ocean, discoveries that could help the U.S. wean itself off Middle Eastern oil but could also turn out to be pollution nightmares. Although environmentalists have <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175264">warned</a> of the risks of drilling in the pre-salt fields, where a <em>Deepwater Horizon</em>-like blowout is an ever-present danger, Obama has made no secret of his geopolitical priorities. “By some estimates, the oil you recently discovered off the shores of Brazil could amount to twice the reserves we have in the United States,” he <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/19/remarks-president-ceo-business-summit-brasilia-brazil">told</a> Brazilian business leaders in that country’s capital. “When you’re ready to start selling, we want to be one of your best customers. At a time when we’ve been reminded how easily instability in other parts of the world can affect the price of oil, the United States could not be happier with the potential for a new, stable source of energy.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Obama has made it clear that the U.S. will retain its role as the ultimate guardian of the Persian Gulf sea lanes. Even while trumpeting the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from Iraq, he has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/world/middleeast/united-states-plans-post-iraq-troop-increase-in-persian-gulf.html">insisted</a> that the United States will bolster its air, naval, and special operations forces in the Gulf region, so as to remain the preeminent military power there. “Back to the future,” is how Major General Karl R. Horst, chief of staff of the U.S. Central Command, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/world/middleeast/united-states-plans-post-iraq-troop-increase-in-persian-gulf.html">described</a> the new posture, referring to a time before the Iraq War when the U.S. exercised dominance in the region <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175498/engelhardt_offshore_everywhere">mainly through</a> its air and naval superiority.</p>
<p>While less conspicuous than “boots on the ground,” the expanded air and naval presence will be kept strong enough to overpower any conceivable adversary. “We will have a robust continuing presence throughout the region,” Secretary of State Hillary Clinton <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/world/middleeast/united-states-plans-post-iraq-troop-increase-in-persian-gulf.html">declared</a> last October. Such a build-up has in fact been <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/12/world/la-fg-us-persian-gulf-20120113">accentuated</a>, in preparation either for a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, should Obama conclude that negotiations to curb Iranian enrichment activities have reached a dead end, or to clear the Strait of Hormuz, if the Iranians carry out <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/12/27/iran-threatens-to-cut-off-oil-exports-if-sanctions-imposed-over-nuclear-activity">threats</a> to block oil shipping there in retaliation for the even harsher economic sanctions due to be imposed after July 1st.</p>
<p>Like Cheney, Obama also seeks to ensure U.S. control over the vital sea lanes extending from the <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175496/tomgram%3A_michael_klare,_no_exit_in_the_persian_gulf/">Strait of Hormuz</a> to the South China Sea. This is, in fact, the heart of Obama’s much publicized policy “<a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175476/michael_klare_a_new_cold_war_in_asia">pivot</a>” to Asia and his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/world/asia/united-states-sees-china-everywhere-as-it-shifts-attention-to-asia.html">new military doctrine</a>, first revealed in a speech to the Australian Parliament on November 17th. “As we plan and budget for the future,” he <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/17/remarks-president-obama-australian-parliament">declared</a>, “we will allocate the resources necessary to maintain our strong military presence in this region.” A major priority of this effort, he indicated, would be enhanced “maritime security,” especially in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Central to the Obama plan &#8212; like that advanced by Dick Cheney in 2007 &#8212; is the construction of a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203537304577028490161890480.html">network</a> of bases and alliances encircling China, the globe’s rising power, in an arc stretching from Japan and South Korea in the north to Australia, Vietnam, and the Philippines in the southeast and thence to India in the southwest. When describing this effort in Canberra, Obama <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/world/asia/obama-and-gillard-expand-us-australia-military-ties.html">revealed</a> that he had just concluded an agreement with the Australian government to establish a new U.S. military basing facility at Darwin on the country’s northern coast, near the <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175540/michael_klare_energy_wars_heat_up">South China Sea</a>. He also <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/17/remarks-president-obama-australian-parliament">spoke</a> of the ultimate goal of U.S. geopolitics: a region-embracing coalition of anti-Chinese states that would include India. “We see America’s enhanced presence across Southeast Asia,” both in growing ties with local powers like Australia and “in our welcome of India as it ‘looks east’ and plays a larger role as an Asian power.”</p>
<p>As anyone who follows Asian affairs is aware, a strategy aimed at encircling China &#8212; especially one intended to incorporate India into America’s existing Asian alliance system &#8212; is <a href="http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38715&#038;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=25&#038;cHash=b17a7a99a3ee2726f13bb6a96e842e90">certain</a> to produce alarm and pushback from Beijing. “I don’t think they’re going to be very happy,” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/world/asia/obama-addresses-troops-at-final-stop-in-australia.html">said</a> Mark Valencia, a senior researcher at the National Bureau of Asian Research, speaking of China’s reaction. “I’m not optimistic in the long run as to how this is going to wind up.”</p>
<p>Finally, Obama has followed in Cheney’s footsteps in his efforts to reduce Russia’s influence in Europe and Central Asia by promoting the construction of new oil and gas pipelines from the Caspian via Georgia and Turkey to Europe. On June 5th, at the Caspian Oil and Gas Conference in Baku, President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan read a <a href="http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&#038;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=39461">message</a> from Obama promising Washington’s support for a proposed Trans-Anatolia gas pipeline, a conduit designed to carry natural gas from Azerbaijan across Georgia and Turkey to Europe &#8212; bypassing Russia, naturally. At the same time, Secretary of State Clinton traveled to Georgia, just as Cheney had, to <a href="http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&#038;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=39469">reaffirm</a> U.S. support and offer increased U.S. military aid. As during the Bush-Cheney era, these moves are bound to be seen in Moscow as part of a calculated drive to lessen Russia’s influence in the region &#8212; and so are certain to elicit a hostile response.</p>
<p>In virtually every respect, then, when it comes to energy geopolitics the Obama administration continues to carry out the strategic blueprint pioneered by Dick Cheney during the two Bush administrations. What explains this surprising behavior? Assuming that it doesn’t represent a literal effort to replicate Cheney’s thinking &#8212; and there’s no evidence of that &#8212; it clearly represents the triumph of imperial geopolitics (and hidebound thinking) over ideology, principle, or even simple openness to new ideas.<br />When you get two figures as different as Obama and Cheney pursuing the same pathways in the world &#8212; and the first time around was anything but a success &#8212; it’s a sign of just how closed and airless the world of Washington really has become. At a time when most Americans are weary of grand ideological crusades, the pursuit of what looks like simple national self-interest &#8212; in the form of assured energy supplies &#8212; may appear far more attractive as a rationale for military and political involvement abroad.</p>
<p>In addition, Obama and his advisers are no doubt influenced by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/business/energy-environment/inching-toward-energy-independence-in-america.html">talk</a> of a new “golden age” of North American oil and gas, made possible by the exploitation of shale deposits and other unconventional &#8212; and often dirty &#8212; energy resources. According to <a href="http://205.254.135.7/forecasts/ieo/">projections</a> given by the Department of Energy, U.S. reliance on imported energy is likely to decline in the years ahead (though there is a <a href="http://oilandglory.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/06/05/can_we_survive_the_new_golden_age_of_oil">domestic price</a> to be paid for such “independence”), while China’s will only rise &#8212; a seeming geopolitical advantage for the United States that Obama appears to relish.</p>
<p>It is easy enough to grasp the appeal of such energy geopolitics for White House strategists, especially given the woeful state of the U.S. economy and the declining utility of other instruments of state power. And if you are prepared to overlook the growing environmental risks of reliance on offshore oil, shale gas, and other unconventional forms of energy, rising U.S. energy output conveys certain geopolitical advantages. But as history suggests, engaging in aggressive global geopolitical confrontations with other determined, well-armed players usually leads to friction, crisis, war, and disaster.</p>
<p>In this regard, Cheney’s geopolitical maneuvering led us into two costly Middle Eastern wars while heightening tensions with both China and Russia. President Obama claims he seeks to build a more peaceful world, but copying the Cheney energy blueprint is bound to produce the exact opposite.</p>

<p>Confidence Indicators Deteriorated Significantly This Week<br /> <br />This week national confidence surveys rolled in with just one story: the economic infection in Europe is spreading. Business confidence indicators in France and Germany declined 1.1% and 1.6%, respectively, in the month of June. In Italy consumer confidence hit another record low since 1996 of 85.3 after falling 1.4% in June.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/confidence_measures.jpg"><img alt="" height="376" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/confidence_measures.jpg" width="503"></a></p>

<p>The National Bank of Belgium and Statistics Netherlands released their balance measures of consumer confidence. Both balances fell 2 points over the month of June. Notably, consumer confidence in the Netherlands is depressed, hitting a record low since 1986 at -40 in June.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/confidence_netherlands_belgium.jpg"><img alt="" height="376" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/confidence_netherlands_belgium.jpg" width="503"></a></p>
<p>These are highly credible indices with robust correlations with hard data like real retail sales and production. Given the precipitous decline in confidence, it’s hard to imagine how European economic sentiment will turn around without truly innovative policy action.<br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong><br /><strong><em>Rebecca Wilder</em></strong></p>
