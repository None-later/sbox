<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article7914.html">Market Oracle</a> has an opinion on where the trade deficit will be headed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Durable and capital goods</p>
<p>The US&#8217;s manufacturing sector is concentrated in industries most vulnerable to an economic downturn, durable and capital goods. Durable goods are products that last for more than three years like SUVs, motor/sail boats, etc. These items are the first areas where consumers cut back spending, which is why the big three are in so much trouble. Capital goods are equipment/machinery used in creating other goods, and the biggest demand for these products has come from emerging markets with their growing manufacturing sectors. With emerging market manufacturing now in contraction, demand for these capital goods is set to disappear, which leaves the US in a disastrous situation:</p>
<p>    * We make mining equipment at a time when commodity prices are crashing and mines are shutting down.<br />    * We make construction equipment (caterpillars, pickup trucks, etc…) at a time when global construction is grinding to a halt.<br />    * We make civilian aircrafts at a time when global trade and travel is quickly contracting.</p>
<p>Cheap consumer goods</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum from durable and capital goods are the cheap consumer goods found in retailers like Wal-mart. Demand for these lower-end consumer products tends to hold through the severest of recessions, because they are absolutely essential to our modern standard of living. While some current shoppers at Wal-Mart might be forced to cut spending on these essential items, new spending from shoppers who are downgrading from higher end stores will pick up a lot of this shortfall. For example, as more American&#8217;s lose their jobs, there will be a lot of consumers downgrading from designer clothes to Wal-Mart&#8217;s cheaper clothing. The resiliency of Wal-Mart sale is bad news for the US, as virtually all the retailer&#8217;s cheap goods are imports from Asia.</p>
<p>The trade deficit</p>
<p>A quick look at where the US&#8217;s trade deficit is concentrated reveals just how grim the outlook is. We are running huge deficits in consumer goods and industrial supplies (oil), which we desperately need, and the only category with a sizable surplus is capital goods (civilian aircrafts, mining equipment, etc), for which global demand is crashing. This explains why the US trade deficit grew in October. </p></blockquote>
<p>Spencer mentioned in an e-mail that to date he is not sure the deficit is worsening.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not so sure the US trade deficit is worsening.</p>
<p>It did last month, but that looks like one month<br />of a counter trend movement.</p>
<p>It would be out of line with historic trends<br />that in recessions imports drop so much<br />that the US trade deficit improves.</p>
<p>Also note that the I/S ratio is up sharply<br />this fall and that implies that imports will weaken over<br />the next 6 months as retailers cut back<br />on import orders to reduce inventories.</p>
<p>real imports a function of:<br />1.  lagged change in relative import/domestic prices<br />2.  lagged change in domestic consumption<br />3.  current change in inventories.</p>
<p>over an expansion no. 3 is not important,<br />but in recessions it plays a major role.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/opinion/05krugman.html?_r=1" target="_blank">Krugman</a> correctly lays out the problem: We are facing the second Great Depression. Agreed again that simple monetary policy is not enough. Agreed also that a stimulus package is certainly needed; otherwise the domino effect of shrinking businesses and increasing unemployment, together with tight credit and deflation will prove disastrous.</p>
<p>The point I have made repeatedly is that a stimulus package, while necessary, must be combined with programs and policies that address root problems. Otherwise, after the stimulus package runs its course, we will again be in the same boat: A wasteful and inefficient health care system now out of cost control, an energy independence policy too long neglected with costs poised to re-escalate once Americans are back to work, a trade policy that has permitted massive imbalances in the global economy, and a banking system that remains fearful and frozen.</p>
<p>Krugman despairs that the stimulus plan will come too late and too little. Even if Congress acts quickly&#8211;which is unlikely&#8211;, projects need time to be properly planned and organized. We may not have that time.</p>
<p>Of course, Congress could do revenue sharing with states and localities, as Galbraith suggested; thus passing off the actual delineation and oversight of projects, while quickening their progress and enhancing the prospects for their success.</p>
<p>But, as I have said repeatedly, much more is needed. Attacking the symptoms of the disease is not enough. We must simultaneously address root causes.</p>
<p>I outline them again, without too much comment:
<ul>
<li>Universal health care, setting fees and schedules. Putting such in place would remove an enormous monetary burden from millions of Americans. The actual cost of doing business would be improved. Consider the Canadian, the British, or the French systems, which are far more cost effective than the American. This is one investment that will actually save money. </li>
<li>Crash programs in energy independence. Nothing should be off the table. Cheap oil is a reflection of the growing crisis. What happens when the crisis is passed? Expect energy prices to rise once again. </li>
<li>A sensible trade policy. At the very least, we should insist that China allow its currency to float more freely. If we cannot even do that, there is no hope. Once spending starts again, will we just return to buying Asian? Will jobs continue to flow to emerging nations? At some point, we must address the current account deficit and the net trade imbalance. </li>
<li>A national bank. If private banks continue to tighten credit&#8211;and in this environment it is natural that they will&#8211;, then we should create a national bank that will lead the way.</li>
</ul>

                                <p>How is Social Security holding up given the terrible employment numbers? Well not as bad as I had feared.</p>
<p>OAS::Opening balance//Projected year end balance-Intermediate Cost//Y-O-Y Increase//Year end balance-Low Cost//Y-O-Y increase-Low Cost<br />$2.023 trillion // $2.216 trillion //$193 billion// $2.221 trillion// $198 billion</p>
<p>DI::Opening balance//Projected year end balance-Intermediate Cost//Y-O-Y Increase//Year end balance-Low Cost//Y-O-Y increase-Low Cost<br />$214.9 billion//$218.7 billion//$3.8 billion//$221.3 billion// $6.4 billion.<br />Per IV.A2 the opening balance for DI was $214.9 billion, projected year end under IC $218.7 billion, under LC $221.3 billion</p>
<p>June 30th/Mid-year: OAS $2.140 trillion// DI $220 billion</p>
<p>Aug 31st/Two-thirds: OAS $2.164 trillion// DI $219 billion</p>
<p>Sept 30th/Q3: OAS $2.177 trillion//  DI $219 billion</p>
<p>Oct 30th/Five-sixths: OAS $2.187 trillion// DI $218 billion</p>
<p>Nov 30th/Eleven twelvths: OAS $2.197 trillion//DI $217.5 billion. So what does all this mean? Well nothing really. Mostly the outlook is unchanged, which is why I&#8217;ll keep the brief discussion below the fold.</p>
<p>The DI (Disability Insurance) Trust Fund is more or less holding its own with the balance in recent months dropping by less than a billion a month. A reasonable year end estimate for this fund would be something over $216 billion which would put it  below both Intermediate Costs projection of $219 billion and Low Cost&#8217;s projection of $221 billion. Not great news but maybe what you would expect in the face of an extended downturn, if you had managed to stay in the regular work force during the boom but really would qualify for Disability the 2007-2008 period might be the right time to make the transition. But spin it how I will, and putting on a happy smile through gritted teeth, there is little doubt that the 2009 Report will show some degradation in the outlook for DI. And this true even though the year over year balance is still positive.</p>
<p>As for OAS. Well it is still running a surplus, but then a good part of that is accrued interest. And the same will be true for December, the Treasury will still be crediting interest on the existing portfolio of bonds and so we can expect some uptick, but a fair estimate is that OAS is kind of on auto-pilot right now. Still we can expect about an additional $10 billion in the TF by years end taking the total balance up to maybe S2.207 compared to Intermediate Cost projections of  $2.216 trillion and Low Cost Projections of $2.221 trillion. So once again we will probably see a miniscule deterioration in outlook come the release of the new Report come March. But once again the net year over year effect is to show continued surpluses.</p>
<p>You have to wonder how many other multi-trillion dollar funds saw slightly less than expected but still positive returns over the last year.</p>
<p>Bottom line. Social Security is not immune to periods of economic crisis, how could it  be. But it is buffered by being tied to real wage on the one hand and CPI on the other and calculates its health from the top down rather than the bottom up. That is a change in unemployment for 4.5% to 6.9% computes to more than a 50% increase when examined from the bottom up. And if you are out of work that may be the right metric. But from the point of view of Social Security that just means a drop from 84.5% to 73.1%  of covered workers paying in, meaning that payroll tax based worker retirement can never take the hit that individual workers do in any given year.</p>

<p>I understand that traders are compensated roughly half based on mark to market profits in a given year and half on long term outcomes (the was the AIG AIG-FP deal).  This implies that many people made a lot of money being wrong about the housing bubble etc.    It also implies that the conditions for profitable market manipulation are much broader than they would be if market manipulators were trading their own money and the conditions for sophisticated traders to buy into bubbles are weaker.  </p>
<p>Using his BA in philosophy Matt Yglesias <a target="_blank" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/01/bob_rodriguez.php">gets this point</a>.  Compensation based, even in part, on short run mark to market profits is a recipe for disaster.  </p>
<p>I see (via Yves Smith) that <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/09/journal-tells-us-quants-have-suffered.html">Financial Times&#8217; John Dizard</a> puts it well</p>
<blockquote><p>A once-in-10-years-comet- wiping-out-the-dinosaurs disaster is a problem for the investor, not the manager-mammal who collects his compensation annually, in cash, thank you. He has what they call a &#8220;résumé put&#8221;, not a term you will find in offering memoranda, and nine years of bonuses&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>A &#8220;model&#8221; after the jump.</p>
<p>The model is based on </p>
<p>J. Bradford DeLong, Andrei Shleifer, et al (1990), &#8220;Positive-Feedback Investment Strategies and Destabilizing Rational Speculation,&#8221; Journal of Finance 45: 2 (June), pp. 374-397.</p>
<p>There are 3 types of agent in the model.  First necessarily there are momentum traders or trend chasers, agents who buy assets whose price just increased (say like you know houses).  Second there are value investors whose demand for assets is downward sloping in current price just like a normal demand curve (call them Buffets)<br />super smart investors who know all about fundamental values *and* about the momentum traders (Soroses).  There were two results, under extreme assumptions about mementum traders it is possible that sophisticated traders drive asset prices further from their fundamental value when there is a disturbance, that is pump up the bubble.  It is also possible that, without any exogenous shock, the sophisticated investors deliberately trigger a bubble &#8212; that is manipulate the market.</p>
<p>The asset in the model is finite lived.  The challenge is that it gets back to its fundamental model when in matures (in period 4).  This makes it hard to find cases where it is rational to buy into a bubble or manipulate the market.  </p>
<p>With an incentive contract such that people get paid in uhm period 2 based on marked to market profits then never ever have to give that money back, I think it is enough that there be some momentum traders.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say I am a manager who controls a large amount of money and I want to manipulate the market.  I buy a lot of an asset.  I have to pay a high price to get it from the Buffets.  Suddenly momentum traders want the asset too so next period they buy (and I don&#8217;t sell).  Mark to market says I have made money.    If other super sophisticated traders know what is going on they will cooperate with me.  I think this strategy is technically illegal, but there is no way to detect it.</p>
<p>I think the only thing that protects us from this is the irrational arrogance of financial operators.  They consider their position to be very valuable as they think they can systematically beat the market.  If they knew they were mostly just lucky to  be where they are, they would be more tempted to cash in by manipulating the market.  </p>
<p>In any case, the fact that traders don&#8217;t really lose when they buy into bubbles is a reason that only the very very top managers got a bad deal out of the 21st century so far.  </p>
<p>I think the worse problem is, as Yglesias note, the contrarian looses for a while and might be out of the business irreversibly by the time the crash comes.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Paul Rosenberg has started an interesting series over at Open Left that in some ways could see my post <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/12/what-was-nexus.html">What is the Nexus?</a> as prologue.</p>
<p>The first post in the series is <a href="http://openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=10701">Hegemony On Steroids&#8211;Episode 35,879: &#8220;The Neocons Couldn&#8217;t A Dunnit!&#8221;</a> It starts by stating one set of revisionist talking points eagerly being peddled by wingnuttia (and the Village) to keep from having to take responsibility for Iraq<br />
<blockquote>Last week, the day before Christmas, Digby took note of an eager wanker (Frank Harvey, pimped by Kelly McParland) making the argument that if Gore had been President instead of Bush, we would have had the exact same clusterfuck, because (a) the neocons had nothing to do with it, that&#8217;s just a conspiracy theory! (b) invading Iraq was inevitable and (c) Al Gore had all sorts of hawkish attitudes, towards Iraq in particular, so, case closed!</p></blockquote>
<p> Well Digby did a through take down on points (b) and (c). Mainly in that Al Gore came out publicly against the then current Bush approach on Sept 23, 2002, i.e. before the war.  (Extensive quotes and links at OL). Which allows Paul to pursue assertion (a). </p>
<p>And in the course of that he totally demolishes the twin arguments that the Neo-Cons were not powerful enough to get everyone else to go along and that in the end everybody was sharing the same intelligence analysis. Both are simple nonsense and Paul lays out the case why that is so. Conclusion of part 1<br />
<blockquote>In fact, if one looks carefully at what was going on behind the screen&#8211;and even just what was going on in plain sight&#8211;it soon becomes quite apparent that BushCo and the neocons were quite aware of how utterly flimsy their &#8220;evidence&#8221; was.  They may have fooled some other folks&#8211;or at least bluffed them into playing safe and stiffling their doubts&#8211;but they knew all along their case couldn&#8217;t stand the light of day.</p>
<p>Which is why they never laid it out for anyone else to see.  They knew very well that there was no &#8220;there&#8221; there.  They were eager to show us all the evidence.  They just didn&#8217;t have any.</p>
<p>In Part 2, we&#8217;ll take a closer look.</p></blockquote>
<p> Link to Part 2 and some comments below the fold<br /><a href="http://openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=10706"><br />Hegemony On Steroids&#8211;&#8220;The Neocons Couldn&#8217;t A Dunnit!&#8221;, Part 2</a><br />
<blockquote>After the Iraq fiasco, the key to continuing neocon power was two-fold: First, disappearing the disaster. Second disappearing the neocons themselves.  The disaster was disappeared by a series of rationalizations and redefinitions, the most important of which was the replacement of the original rationale&#8211;9/11, WMDs and all that&#8211;with goal of &#8220;democratization&#8221; (which the US originally had no interest in), and the replacement of all else with the mantra, &#8220;the surge is working.&#8221;  Disappearing the neocons involved a rather extensive chameleon act, a key part of which was the erasure of their fingerprints all over everything in sight.<br />This is where we get the common bit of hegemonic narrative used to excuse the Iraq War, the claim that &#8220;everyone&#8221; believed the intelligence that Saddam had WMDs.  This narrative is not just false, it&#8217;s a textbook case of how hegemonic discourse makes it virtually impossible to think straight about anything.  There&#8217;s an old adage that if you ask the wrong questions, you can&#8217;t get the right answers.  Hegemonic discourse works best by making sure that nothing but wrong questions get asked.</p>
<p>By implicitly making the question, &#8220;did everyone believe Saddam had WMDs?&#8221;&#8211;and not even asking it, but simply asserting an answer, every question we ought to be asking is summarily swept off the table.  And the chance of making a truly fundamental break with the neocon direction is substantially weakened</p></blockquote>
<p> If some of this sounds awfully familiar it should, various commenter/war supporters here have been faithfully pushing versions of this argument for years.</p>
<p>In any event Paul goes on to give a detailed chronological timeline of how the intelligence was being consciously shaped around the war policy. In other words the Brits had it exactly right in the Downing Street Memo. The question of why Blair and Powell and Rice and Tenet (none of them neo-cons) and yes too many congressional democrats went along is really the theme of the rest of the piece. The whole thing is longish but certainly worth it.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>When Biden talked of Obama being tested, he should have noted that some of our so-called friends will test him even more. So it is with the horror that is now Gaza. American-Likud foreign policy has been cruel and disastrous. The Likud government continues to expand its settlements, cutting so-called Palestine into ever more pronounced Swiss cheese. The U.S. politely protests but continues to look the other way. Both Lukud and the U.S. have repeatedly insisted that they and they alone have the right to select the leaders of Palestine. Unhappy with Arafat? Unhappy with Hamas? Get rid of them.</p>
<p>Perhaps Israel should stop the charade and simply annex Palestine. Democratic elections clearly mean nothing to the to Israel&#8230;or the U.S. in this matter?  Why should it when it has a world-class military force pitted against rocks and a few rockets.</p>
<p>After a right wing zealot assassinated Rabin and after the aborted Clinton-Barak-Arafat meeting, there has been no serious peace process. Instead, the U.S. has allowed the Likud government to dictate not only its path in the Palestinian conflict but also its Middle East policy in general. The net result has been to radicalize more and more Islamists.</p>
<p>I listened this morning to Ofir Gendelman of the Israeli Foreign Ministry claim that there was and has never been a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, that passage for supplies to Gaza have always been open. When told that journalists inside Gaza have been reporting just the opposite, he responded that those Hamas is clearly intimidating them. When told that the Supreme Court of Israeli has said that foreign journalists should be allowed to cover what is going on in Gaza and asked why the Israeli government would not allow such coverage, he responded that the world would then blame Israel if they got hurt or killed. But journalist cover wars all the time. And so the defense of the indefensible continues. Of course this confrontational exchange occurred on CBC television; it would never be allowed to air in the U.S. The simple explanation those in the U.S. hear is: Israel is defending itself from Hamas rockets.</p>
<p>The Canadian commentator then confronted Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian negogiator, about those rocket attacks. Her simple reply was that Hamas had maintained a six month cease fire&#8230;and still Israel maintained a siege on Gaza, one of the most densely populated places in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any responsibility on the part of Hamas,&#8221; the commentator asked?</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the people under occupation,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;You would do the same.&#8221; She continued that ultimately all sides will have to sit down and work this out and realize that bloodshed gets us nowhere.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/world/middleeast/04assess.html?_r=1&#038;hp" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> described part of the problem:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>“If the war ends in a draw, as expected, and Israel refrains from re-occupying Gaza, Hamas will gain diplomatic recognition,” wrote Aluf Benn, a political analyst, in the newspaper Haaretz on Friday. “No matter what you call it,” he added, “Hamas will obtain legitimacy.” </p>
<p>In addition, any potential truce deal would probably include an increase in commercial traffic from Israel and Egypt into Gaza, which is Hamas’s central demand: to end the economic boycott and border closing it has been facing. To build up the Gaza economy under Hamas, Israeli leaders say, would be to build up Hamas. Yet withholding the commerce would continue to leave 1.5 million Gazans living in despair. </p>
<p>Implicit in Mr. Benn’s argument, however, is that the only way to stop Hamas from gaining legitimacy is for Israel to fully occupy Gaza again, more than three years after removing its soldiers and settlers. That is a prospect practically no one in Israel or abroad is advocating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see no end to this tragedy until America straightens out its crooked and disastrous slavish following of Likud. America&#8217;s media and America&#8217;s leaders have been tied to the hip of right wing, religious fanatics in Israel. These are harsh words&#8211;and meant to be.</p>
<p>The testing of Obama has begun.</p>

<p>(hat tip 2slugbaits) Krugman says <a target="_blank" href="http://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/optimalg.pdf">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What I’ve illustrated here is the marginal cost and benefit of government purchases of public goods in and near a liquidity trap. The marginal benefit is presumably a downward-sloping curve. If G is low, so that monetary policy cannot achieve full employment, the marginal cost of an additional unit of G is low, because the additional government purchases don’t crowd out private spending. Once G is high enough to bring full employment, however, any further rise in government purchases will be offset by a rise in the interest rate, so that extra G does come at the expense of C, implying a jump in the marginal cost.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a back-of-the-envelope model explaining why monetary policy won&#8217;t do the job and why we need fiscal policy to stimulate aggregate demand.  ( I was going to try for more but injured my foot so am in no mood to continue&#8230;really, not the social kind involving mouth.)</p>

                                <p>In 1979 Peter Sellers starred in a brilliant movie about the ultimate in accidental Presidents. As the movie ends Chance the Gardiner has not actually been elevated to be Leader of the Free World but is well on his way. Because people could read meanings they wanted to hear into what he was saying. I hadn&#8217;t made the connection until today but this movie tells us much about the process which left us with the Boy Chimperor Bush. When Chance admits &#8220;I don&#8217;t read&#8221; this is taken as a statement that he instead acts from the gut and not by taking direction from the pointy headed among us. Which should sound painfully familiar. You want a &#8216;Bush Legacy Project&#8217;? I suggest forwarding a copy of the DVD to his library. It will probably give a lot more insight than any number of future biographies.</p>
<p>The only real difference between Chance the Gardiner and George W. Chimperor is that the team that picked Chance to be the leader of the Free World didn&#8217;t know where he came from. Whereas Uncurious George came with a pedigree. But the decision making process was much the same.</p>

<p>Kafka and Bills</p>
<p>Back in May, we moved out of state.  Before we did, we canceled our assorted services, ranging from the newspaper subscription to gas.  One of the utilities we canceled was Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  The ex-GF called, and they said they&#8217;d do a final reading and send a bill to the address we provided; a two month temporary apartment.   Perhaps we should have been more pro-active about wondering about where that bill went, but what with the move out of state (actually, two moves), a new job, etc., there was a lot on our minds.</p>
<p>Fast forward (more than) a few months.  The day before Christmas, my ex-GF gets a call from a collection agency.  They had gotten her phone number from LA DWP, which was irate that we hadn&#8217;t paid the final bill; issued in September one month after we had moved out of our temporary apartment.  We never got that bill, or any other notices from DWP. And, apparently it never occurred to the folks at LA DWP that if they had my wife&#8217;s phone number, they might try to call her themselves before paying a collections agency to do just that with the number they provided to the collections agency.  Again &#8211; perhaps we should have been more diligent, but things fall through the crack when you&#8217;re moving around&#8230; and we had provided contact info &#8211; a place to send the bill that might have been useful had they not taken four months to put out a new bill (if it was ever sent), and a phone number that remains valid to this day.</p>
<p>So my wife decides to call the LA DWP to see if she could pay them directly.  She spoke to several people at LA DWP including several supervisors, and every one of them claimed not to be authorized to accept payment for this bill.  She even left several messages with the collections department of LADWP and no one returned the messages.  So she called back the collections agency &#8211; PMR Progressive &#8211; and perhaps because its the holiday season, nobody answered.  She&#8217;s called back.  Nobody answers.  <br />______________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>While blogging here at Angry Bear, I have been almost as blunt and direct as I am ignorant, but I would like to be much more frank in this post. The question, roughly, is which innovative financial instruments and trading strategies are socially useful.  This is important, because people argue against draconian regulation on the grounds that it will block financial innovation and/or interfere with the trading strategies of legitimate arbitrageurs.   My honest opinion is that all recently developed instruments are harmful and that the typical activities of law abiding financial operators destroy value.   I don&#8217;t see any downside risk of excessive regulation basically because I think that, on balance, the allegedly undesirable side effects are desirable.  </p>
<p>It should be possible to guess that I don&#8217;t think that &#8220;market liquidity&#8221; is a good thing.   I use quotes as I would define assets as liquid or illiquid and markets at thick or thin.  The issue is whether one can quickly buy or sell a large amount of an asset without causing its price to shift much.  I believe (without proof as usual) that assets are liquid when trading volume is high.  Thus my question becomes whether high trading volume is a good or a bad thing.  </p>
<p> A sudden decline in the liquidity of assets can create problems as firms can&#8217;t unwind leveraged positions without extreme market disruption.  If the assets had always been illiquid, those leveraged positions would never exist.  I think that would be a good thing.</p>
<p>Now there is a class of arguments that rational investors will take highly leveraged positions to profit from asset miss pricing and that this is socially desirable as they will drive asset prices towards their fundamental values.  It is hard find these arguments convincing given the enormous increase in asset price volatility which has accompanied the enormous increase in gross long positions and gross short positions not to mention the huge increase in trading volume.   My sense is that the average super smart highly trained trader is driving asset prices away from fundamentals.  Thus I think honestly reported legal trading strategies are, on average, worsening the quality of the signals financial markets send to the real economy.</p>
<p>In particular, hedging strategies require constant trading.  They are not feasible if there are significant bid ask spreads.  The scale of hedged positions is limited if assets aren&#8217;t perfectly liquid as the hedging trades drive prices against the hedger.  So ?  There is no huge amount of trading by people who don&#8217;t follow hedging strategies such that a huge amount of hedged trading is required to balance it.  Rather the huge volume consists of roughly equally sophisticated traders, all of whom know how to hedge, taking bets against each other.  The cure is the disease.  </p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be this way.  I would be possible for trading volume to be tiny compared to current volume &#8212; the way it was in the 50s.  Trading for reasons other than perceived asset misspricing would be very rare.  There would be investors who save when young and dissave when old, investors who liquidate financial assets to make downpayments on houses and maybe a tiny bit of investors hedging their labor income risk (has anyone ever met anyone who ever did that ?).  Now the most archaic market in which there are specialists who sell for one eighth of a cent more than they pay when they buy would be a tiny tiny problem for life cycle investors.   If people aren&#8217;t trying to beat the market, liquidity barely matters to them.</p>
<p>As noted above, if no one tries to beat the market no one gathers information on, say, firms prospects.  That would imply that price earnings ratios of shares would depend on rough guesses.  That wouldn&#8217;t be strong form efficient.  I don&#8217;t think any sensible person can look at the history of asset prices and doubt that the old market in the 50s  was closer to a strong form efficiency.</p>
