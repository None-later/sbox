                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A friend of mine used to say:  “I’ve never been to Australia, but I know its there.”  Now, if you think about it, that expression goes a long way toward explaining how we all interact.  After all, how do we really know there is an Australia?  </p>
<p>Now, full disclosure…. I’ve never been to Australia either, but like my friend, I’m pretty sure its there in the sense that there’s a place shaped more or less like the continental United States, but sitting out in the middle of nowhere – relatively close to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.  Also, I’m pretty sure a lot of the elements of the narrative about Australia that we all have in common – that the people over there say funny things like “another shrimp on the barbie” and that its infested with vicious carnivores like koalas and kangaroos – happen to be true.  </p>
<p>Anyway, so how do we know that Australia truly does exist, as opposed to being a truly imaginary place like New Zealand?  Even people who have been to Australia might be wrong – after all, it might be that when you fly to Australia, what you’re really doing is circling around the Pacific for a few hours and then landing somewhere in the boondocks in Nevada.  Most folks who claim to be from Australia could be in on this, Capricorn One-style, with the remainder being innocent simpletons who haven’t figured out the scam. </p>
<p>Well, an economist would think cost and benefits.  The costs of mounting such a monumental hoax would be enormous.  The benefits – well, there would be some… how could you get people to visit Elko County if you didn’t dress it up?  But the financial costs would exceed the financial benefits by many orders of magnitude. </p>
<p>So a rational person would conclude, reluctantly perhaps, that Australia probably does exist – even if they had never been there.</p>
<p>Which leads me to <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTc5ZGQ1ZWFiZmI2NDg4MGU1MDU3MDRkZWJlZDEyNzc=">this</a> from one of the denizens of the National Review:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rich, I thought your column yesterday made a very important point. The letters you post today make valid points as well. Media coverage of Iraq has been biased, and that bias has indeed helped to shape events there for the worse. At the same time, conservative distrust of the media’s very real bias has inclined us to dismiss reports about problems in Iraq that are real. <br />In the end, I think the media bears fundamental responsibility for this. Had they been less biased–had they reported acts of heroism and the many good things we have done in Iraq–I think conservatives would actually have taken their reporting of the problems in Iraq more seriously. In effect, the media’s consistent liberal bias discredits even its valid reports.</p></blockquote>
<p>It goes on in this vein, and its worth reading.  Now, a lot of the big name bloggers have commented on it already, but there’s still room for a little guy like me to pipe up.   </p>
<p>One of the many problems with this is that he’s in effect saying that believing in the existence of Australia would be easier if only the NY Times had the occasional story about the Great Australian Controversy – can a creature like the platypus possibly exist, and what’s with the accent and Crocodile Dundee?  The fact that the media is so firmly entrenched in the “Australia Exists” camp only serves to make a smart guy like Kurtz more skeptical.  </p>
<p>Apparently Kurtz doesn’t think like an economist or he’d be asking himself about costs and benefits.  Now, I can think of one big benefit to the media convincing the world that there is a big mess in Iraq, as opposed to a veritable orgy of drive-by school-paintings.  What better way to earn a living can there be than hanging out by a swimming pool in a peaceful exotic land and writing stories about a conflict that doesn’t exist? </p>
<p>But the cost side of the equation is the problem, especially the cost of making sure that everyone who is in on the joke continues to play along.  That includes the military, as the story isn’t credible without regular American deaths.  (Apparently, to a smart guy like Kurtz, even that won’t do it.)  All you need is a bit of film of some of some reporters and their families hanging out at the resort in Basra and in this era of You Tube the gig is up.  </p>
<p>Which brings up another problem…. despite his protestations, Kurtz knew.  The rest of the National Review crowd knew, the conservative bloggers knew, and their readers knew all along that Iraq was a mess.  Sure, they were saying otherwise, and they might even had kept themselves willfully and deliberately ignorant, but deep down, every single one of them, except those that are truly morons, knew.  </p>
<p>How do I know this?  Well, reporters aren’t the only ones who go on vacation.  Any of those people could have decided to go over to Iraq and see the painted school houses or witness the gratitude of the Iraqis up close and personal.  But more importantly – these people are vehement, and they see the conflict as one in which they are personally involved.  They talk about “fighting the war of ideas” on Iraq and their place in it, as if its on a par what the Marines are doing.  Well, you’d figure one of these many tens of thousands of people would have some spare time and money (it doesn’t take much to travel the world, as many poor college students can attest) and would want to be the one who goes over there to amass the proof, the final incontrovertible proof, that the only thing keeping the conflict going is that evil liberal media.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/12/modern_republic.html">Brad DeLong</a> comes a rather strange piece of writing from <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16240579/site/newsweek">Michael Gerson</a>: <br />
<blockquote>During the Reagan years, big government got bigger, with federal spending reaching 23.5 percent of GDP (compared with just over 20 percent under the current president). But the Reagan reality is more admirable than the myth. He wisely chose what was historically necessary &#8211; large defense increases and tax reductions &#8211; over what was politically unachievable: a massive rollback of government. And the critics believe in a caricature of recent budgets. Well over half of President Bush&#8217;s spending increases have gone to a range of unexpected security necessities, including military imminent-danger pay, unmanned aerial vehicles and biological-weapons vaccines.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Gerson bashes small government conservatives, he reaps praise to Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney for being big government conservatives.  Gerson leaves out our big government governor in California – who like Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney promises magic fairy dust in the form of low taxes and lots of spending.  Should I remind Gerson that there is a long-run government budget constraint and the law of scarcity (dubbed crowding-out in macroeconomics) or should we just return the microphone back to Dr. DeLong:<br />
<blockquote>Large defense spending increases and tax reductions don&#8217;t go together. In the short run they produce a fiscal boost to employment. In the medium run they produce slow growth as government deficits drain the pool of capital available for investment. In the long run they produce hyperinflation, as the failure of the government&#8217;s resources to match its commitments leads to an effective default. Such an economic policy strategy is not &#8220;historically necessary.&#8221; It reveals a lack of a moral compass, and either total ignorance about the requirements of good government or enormous cynicism &#8211; a belief that we can make a mess and somebody else, somebody responsible, will clean it up.</p></blockquote>
<p>I may not be a small government conservative but I’d rather listen to them than the nonsense from the likes of Michael Gerson.</p>

<blockquote>the recent diverging trend between short-term and long-term yields has been fairly remarkable. In a typical episode of monetary tightening, as the Fed increases the fed funds rate, long-term yields also rise, though not as much. For example, between January 1994 and February 1995, a 3% increase in the fed funds rate was associated with a 1.7% increase in the 10-year Treasury yield. By contrast, when the Fed increased the funds rate from 1% in June 2004 to 4.25% in December 2005, the rate on 10-year Treasuries fell from 4.7% to 4.5%.  One explanation is that there has been a dramatic drop in the term premium, that is, a decline in the extra expected return that investors require in order to hold long-term securities. An objective summary of the risk that investors perceive from holding long-term bonds comes from the prices of option contracts on Treasury bonds. The lower the price investors are willing to pay for an option that only delivers if there is a big move in interest rates, the safer the long-term investment appears. The implied volatility from these option values (the Merill-Lynch MOVE index) has fallen quite dramatically since 2003, the same time that the yield curve has been flattening and now inverting.</p></blockquote>
<p>We had discussed another angle to the relationship between long-term rates versus short-term rates – that being that canard that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/social-security-if-trust-fund-is.html">Social Security will soon be bankrupt</a>:<br />
<blockquote>we can’t cash in Trust Fund bonds because of trading restrictions. Is this some astute point as those who privately hold Federal bonds can trade them in? Well, let’s think about how market prices respond to default risk. Oh yea, the market prices of long-term bonds would fall, which would mean that their yields would be higher. So let’s check with the reporting of market rates from the Federal Reserve &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Rudebusch, Swanson, and Wu’s paper does not even consider default risk – likely because such risk is seen by market participants as non-existent.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Econ 101 story…  When hiring a CEO, shareholders should worry about competence, but also about the Principal-Agent problem.  The CEO has one set of motivations as CEO (e.g., increase pay, live extravagantly on the company dime, and accumulate adulation) while shareholders have another, namely to increase the value of the company.</p>
<p>Now, for most people, that is a good argument for having a CEO that comes from a family that owns the biggest block of shares in the company.  Who else, these people ask, could possibly be as motivated to see the company succeed as the biggest shareholder?  Who could be more motivated?</p>
<p>My response – just about any randomly selected corporate Vice President in that same company.  Consider such a person.  He (and this person is still probably a he) has worked for the company for 20 years, rising from a lowly entry level position.  This not only means he knows the company inside and out, but it also that a major part of his wealth is tied to the company – mostly in stock options, but the pension and other benefits and perks also contribute substantially to his net worth.  Even his experience – his human capital itself, after 20 years, is heavily tied to the company.</p>
<p>Compare that to a member of the largest shareholding family.  Odds are, this is only part of the family empire, each element of which demands some attention.  If the company fails, that person will still very wealthy, and may find him or herself with the time and resources to start just the sort of enterprise he or she finds most interesting, as opposed to running some big stodgy un-sexy company that&#8217;s been around for decades.</p>
<p>Thus, the largest shareholder probably has less incentive, not more, to ensure the success of the firm than the random corporate Vice President.  He probably also pays less attention, and has less knowledge of the industry.  Additionally, the amount of compensation necessary to motivate the random corporate Vice President is probably a lot less than the amount of compensation needed to motivate someone significantly wealthier.</p>
<p>All things considered, it seems to me that Fortune 500 companies not only often select candidates that are far from the best possible choice, they also have a selection process that ensures that none of the best candidates are even considered.  Back in the 14th century, the selection process for lord of the manor was much the same.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The issue of oil access has come up recently from our own pgl (See <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/iraq-war-access-to-oil_20.html">here</a> ) and also Mark Thoma (See <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/12/what_about_iraq.html">here</a> )  both citing comments about Bush’s press conference today where the subject never came up.  There are two parts to the question:  access to oil revenue by Iraqis and access to oil itself by customers.  pgl gives the standard economic answer to the second question – you buy the oil on the market – and I already commented on his post by saying that one thing I have confidence in is that whoever owns Iraq will sell the oil because that is the way you get rich quick which is what politicians always want.</p>
<p>But then I thought again and it seemed to me that there are some lessons from another oil fueled civil war in a country I have worked in a lot – <country-region><place>Angola</place></country-region>.  While there are of course major differences there are also some similarities that should make us think twice about our answers to the same questions in the Iraqi case.</p>
<p>First, on the question of who gets the oil revenue inside the country, the Angolans fought over this for 25 years.  The civil war was on again and off again but the problem was always that the prize for winning was huge ($2 billion/year more or less) and nobody trusted the other parties to honor any revenue sharing agreement.  So they fought on and on and on until one side won a military victory over the other.  All during this quarter century they did indeed keep on pumping the oil – and that meant that they could afford serious hardware to blow up the whole country since one side had oil and the other diamonds.  At the end of it they have several cities that look like WW2 just ended and a completely destroyed infrastructure.</p>
<p>Would the Iraqis be any different?  Suppose there were some formula worked out for oil revenue.  Would the Sunnis trust the Shias to honor it or vice versa?  Would the Kurds?  Maybe, but there is also a very big chance that they would just fight it out as the Angolans did because the prize is so very big, not just monetarily but also politically and socially.</p>
<p>And as for Bush’s opinion on this, I have more than a sneaking suspicion that they are really interested in maintaining access for their oil industry cronies.  Mightn’t the Iraqis look to some other country for oil engineering expertise if the <country-region><place>US</place></country-region> weren’t there in force?  The French for example are widely rumored to be more willing to engage in payoffs and under the table signing bonuses than are the Americans.  Even if they aren’t it isn’t hard to imagine that American companies wouldn’t be at the head of the line.  The Angolans have pursued a conscious policy of spreading oil contracts among various different companies from various different countries.  Prudence might lead the Iraqis to do the same thing to the detriment of <country-region><place>US</place></country-region> oil company interests.</p>
<p>On the customer side there is little doubt at the present time that the oil market is indeed a market and what one needs to get oil is hard currency.  But it is worth remembering that it hasn’t always been this way.  Thirty some years ago we went through a crisis where oil was NOT allocated by the market but was distributed on an administrative basis for political reasons – we were embargoed.  It would be silly to imagine that it would be impossible for something that happened before to happen again.  So here the Bushies may be less nuts than an economist would think.  Certainly the Chinese think there is value in securing access to oil in the future – This is why they have lent or promised the Angolans almost $10 billion in oil backed loans – If oil is market allocated when the loans come due in the future then the Chinese are in good shape because they already have a contract for it.  If not then the Chinese are still in good shape because they have bought one hell of a lot of good will by giving the Angolans a huge amount of money right up front.</p>
<p>In the <country-region><place>Iraq</place></country-region> case I would imagine that there are contingency plans somewhere in the Pentagon what to do if there is another oil embargo aimed at the <country-region><place>US</place></country-region> – and having some permanent bases would certainly make an oil field takeover easier.  But to think that the <country-region><place>US</place></country-region> isn’t planning ahead for all eventualities would be naïve.  And one thing is for certain:  we can’t depend on the good will of anyone in <country-region><place>Iraq</place></country-region> if we ever get to a non-market allocation of oil at some point in the future.  </p>

But check this &#8211; <a href="http://www.chrishayes.org/blog/2006/dec/20/oil-law">Christopher Hayes</a> says staying in Iraq is important to the Bush crowd because we need access to the oil (hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/12/what_about_iraq.html">Mark Thoma</a>): <br />
<blockquote>But there’s also the not-so-minor fact that if we withdraw from Iraq we’ll have a hard time establishing permanent bases and may not have any secure access to the country’s oil.</p></blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, I temporarily confused sensible Christopher with Stephen Hayes over at Mark’s place.  My apologies to Christopher as he clearly was simply reporting on what certain rightwingers are using as their latest excuse (how many have there been as I’ve lost count) for that stupid decision to invade.  Here’s my problem with the latest excuse – I thought the Bush crowd believed in markets.  Access to oil simply means one buys the stuff.  Never mind the fact that this Administration’s fiscal fiasco is contributing to massive current account deficits and if this continues for long – the U.S. dollar won’t purchase much at all.  But wouldn’t a believer in markets think living within one’s budget constraint so one had the resources to buy goods such as oil be more appropriate than simply taking the stuff by military force.  Something about the efficiency of market trades over the inefficiency of global conflict.</p>
<p>And thanks to Christopher for his thought provoking post.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Not surprisingly from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzllMDQ3YTk4YzY1ZjQ0ZjIzYTVlMzk1Yzk2N2E5ODY=">Peter Ferrara</a> of the National Review.  Ferrara doesn’t like Bush’s idea for “progressive price indexing”.  Full disclosure, I’ve never been too keen on this proposal either but I would never argue redistribution is per se inefficient.  Yet that’s what Ferrara claims:<br />
<blockquote>The folks selling this idea argue that the current wage-indexing system increases benefits for future retirees each year in real terms, above inflation, which is unworkable since all projections show that Social Security doesn’t have the financing to pay such benefits over the long run. But the problem with this reasoning is that taxes paid under the payroll tax rise with wages each year as well. If taxes grow faster than benefits, than the effective rate of return promised by the program would decline each and every year &#8211; into perpetuity. Under the current wage-indexed system, Social Security already offers workers low, well-below-market returns. For most workers currently in the system, the real rate of return promised by the program is 1 percent to 1.5 percent or less. For some it is zero, or even negative. But price indexing would drive more and more workers into this negative-return range, making the program harsh, oppressive, and senseless for many Americans.</p></blockquote>
<p>So many contradictions, so little time.  Of course, some lose from redistribution, while others gain.  You can’t have it both ways.  If the Pozen plan reduces aggregate benefits, it does not also increase insolvency.  But this is not the dishonesty from Ferrara caught my eye.  What caught my eye was his subtitle:<br />
<blockquote>Personal accounts, not short-sighted price-indexing schemes, will answer the Social Security problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>You see, the average return to stock portfolios is 7% according to Ferrara, which of course, is all risk-free.  Funny thing – most individuals don’t believe this nonsense so they tend to put some of their retirement wealth into bonds not stocks.  So if I move $100 in Federal bonds from my left pocket to my right pocket, the increase in my portfolio return is ZERO.</p>

                                <p>Steven Kyle wrote a post yesterday entitled <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/problem-with-incompetence-at-top.html">”Incompetence at the Top”</a>.  This post is an attempt to use his title for a more general purpose.  Y’all might recall I had a post recently in which I discuss estate taxes.  One problem with inheritance, as a concept is that it can lead to incompetence at the top.  </p>
<p>To quote <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1170874.stm">Warren Buffet</a>, repealing the inheritance tax is similar to “&#8221;choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics&#8221;.  </p>
<p>But you don’t really have to repeal the inheritance tax to get that result – in effect, we are more or less at that point already.  As an example… I used to work for a Fortune 500 Company.  While I was there, the CEO retired, and a new CEO was appointed.  The new CEO was young – I believe he was in his 30s.  I never actually met him, but I don’t get the impression he knew much about the industry.  From what I can tell, his primary qualifications for the position were that his father was the previous CEO, and his grandfather was the CEO before that.</p>
<p>Now, even someone ignorant, inexperienced and incompetent can be a good CEO if he or she has good advisors.  (This was the argument we were given for GW, you may recall.)  The problem with this is that person who is ignorant, inexperienced and incompetent is unlikely to know the difference between good advisors and poor ones.  And who picks those advisors?  Those advisors in turn pick their subordinates.  If the advisors were selected by someone incompetent, the odds that they are incompetent are higher, and thus the odds increase that the subordinates they themselves select are incompetent.  The process continues on down the corporate hierarchy.</p>
<p>Now the basic Econ 101 story here would say that companies that are run this way will go out of business, driven out by their more efficient competitors.  The problem is that if you pick your Olympic team from the eldest sons of your previous Olympic team, your team might be good relative to other teams if they select their team the same way.  It seems that one of the big requirements to be CEO is having a parent who is a member of Augusta or a first name like Carlton or Reed.  </p>
<p>I note that the company for which I worked had plenty of very, very competent and knowledgeable people in the lower levels of upper management.  (Corporate Vice Presidents.)  There were also plenty of incompetent ones – as I noted earlier, being competent isn’t necessarily a virtue when the folks who evaluate you can’t tell the difference between those who know what they’re doing and those who don’t. </p>
<p>This means that a CEO that rises from the ranks isn’t necessarily competent either.  That person may simply good at the things that people who are members of Augusta or have first names like Carlton or Reed value, namely the ability to interact with people who are members of Augusta or have first names like Carlton or Reed.  </p>
<p>Now, there are some advantages to a system like the one I describe.  One is that it makes negotiations with other companies and the investment banks (same gene pool) and government (political power often devolves to the same group) easier if your CEO comes from the same circle.  And this makes for quite a barrier to entry against companies run by potentially more competent outsiders.  A second (and this is another Econ 101 argument) is that presumably, the members of the Augusta, the Carltons and the Reeds own the biggest blocks of shares.  Since they have more at stake, the argument goes, they will work harder to ensure the company does well that anyone else would.  (I’ll be covering this issue in another post – I’ll try to write it up later today or in the next couple of days.)  </p>
<p>So, what do you think?  Is this view of corporate America too cynical?</p>

                                <p>Blogging economists have been opining on how to reduce the current account deficit and maintain full employment without risking inflation with the 50 year old insights of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/exchange-rates-and-fiscal-policy.html">Jan Tinbergen</a> playing a prominent role.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/19/AR2006121901634_2.html">Someone</a> must not have been paying attention:<br />
<blockquote>While Bush touted prospects for compromise with Democrats, his chief economic adviser warned yesterday that the new Congress poses the &#8220;biggest risk,&#8221; potentially, to the nation&#8217;s robust economy. Edward P. Lazear, chairman of Bush&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters that he is worried that Democratic lawmakers may try to raise taxes or enact &#8220;isolationist&#8221; trade policies that could steer the country toward recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>In what model does expansionary expenditure-switching policies cause recessions?  And what is Lazear opposed to my suggestion – easy money with tight fiscal policy, which was the 1993 approach?  </p>
<p>As this Washington Post article noted President Bush would support an increase in payroll taxes, <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/12/the_jihad_against_social_secur.html#014884">Dean Baker</a> has an objection to its coverage:<br />
<blockquote>The Washington Post writes again on Social Security, describing the system as the &#8220;fiscally imperiled Social Security system.&#8221; For the facts, CBO says that if nothing is done, the program first faces a shortfall in 40 years. It&#8217;s too bad the Washington Post doesn&#8217;t give the same attention to the problems (e.g. global warming, rising health care costs, the increasing prison population) that will impose much larger costs on the country. But, hey, it&#8217;s a jihad.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This started out as a comment to <stockticker>PGL</stockticker>’s    <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/exchange-rates-and-fiscal-policy.html">post below</a>   but got so long I turned it into a post.  In the comments to what <stockticker>PGL</stockticker> said (which I mostly agree with), Dean Baker says “&#8217;I’m also hard-pressed to see that his deficits played much role in keeping up the value of the dollar” .  This is a question that at first took me by surprise but then I realized that I had been thinking under the presumption that there was such a relationship – and that the sign of the relationship was the opposite of what Dean was implying.  So I am writing this to see if the general readership can shoot holes in my argument so I can decide what I think.</p>
<p>Dean Baker’s argument seems to be that a higher deficit leads to higher interest rates which should strengthen the dollar for interest parity reasons.  That logic makes sense but only as much empirical sense as we can find in interest parity theories of exchange rates.  My impression of these theories is that they work fine except when they don’t, so on that basis one would have to concede that Dean may be right.</p>
<p>But that makes it sound like it is silly to see any relation  between government dissaving and national dissaving (which is what a CA deficit is) and since I certainly do believe that sustained CA deficits eventually lead to depreciation, a link between the government deficit and the CA would mean a link between government deficits and the exchange rate.  While there certainly is no one to one relationship between the federal deficit and the CA deficit it seems a stretch to say there is no relationship at all.  And if there IS a relationship then cutting the deficit reduces the extent to which the dollar eventually has to depreciate by reducing the quantity of dollars we emit into the world every day.</p>
<p>So that is why I have trouble buying the idea that there is no relationship between the deficit and the dollar.</p>
<p>While I hate to sound like an apologist for the IMF, it is a fundamental of stabilization that you need to quit emitting your currency if you want it to stabilize.  It is simply a matter of supply and demand.  If you are supplying too much of your currency then the price of it (the exchange rate) will drop unless demand keeps pace.  The problem in a place like e.g. <country-region><place>Argentina</place></country-region> is that nobody will hold their emitted currency in the first place so there is a direct relation between running a deficit and seeing your currency tank.  If  a country like <country-region><place>Argentina</place></country-region> runs a deficit one of three things can happen:  </p>
<p>1.  They can float bonds like we do and borrow the money, seeing interest rates go up as result.  This is using domestic savings to fund government dissaving.</p>
<p>2.  They can monetize the deficit either directly by forcing the central bank to honor their worthless checks or indirectly by having the central bank buy the bonds back from the public.  This is using an inflation tax to fund government dissaving and basically imposes a tax on anyone holding the currency.</p>
<p>3.  They can sell the bonds to foreigners who can end the chain of causation if they are willing to hold on to them.  This is using foreign savings to fund government dissavings.
</p>
<p>Though a crisis can occur in a variety of ways, if the foreigners lack confidence in the government then signs of incompetent management such as large and growing fiscal deficits will often result in them dumping the bonds and/or refusing to buy new ones.  This quickly throws the government back on options 1 and 2 so that they end up with higher interest rates and a monetization of any new deficit.  The thinner the domestic bond market the more direct is the link between government deficits and monetization, with only the foreigners available to act as a “shock absorber”.  And lots of monetization means lots of money growth, lots of inflation and lots of depreciation</p>
<p>We don’t see the direct relationship between deficits and monetization in the <country-region><place>United States</place></country-region> for two reasons:</p>
<p>1.  We have a big domestic bond market</p>
<p>2.  We have lots of willing foreigners who buy our paper and hold it.</p>
<p>So the real question in this debate is – to what extent are we becoming more like, e.g. <country-region><place>Argentina</place></country-region>, or to what extent do we retain the privileges that go with being the emitter of the world’s reserve currency?</p>
<p>Looking at the past few years it has become increasingly apparent (to me, anyway) that our own bond market has become less important as a marginal buyer of our government’s paper and foreign central banks have become more important.  Of course if Ben B is right, that is because they love our country so much as a place to park their savings that they are outbidding residents for those bonds.   I have trouble believing that story, probably because I spend too much time reading what Brad Setser writes – those willing foreigners are disproportionately foreign central banks who have other plausible reasons for accumulating our paper.  In sum, our government dissaving is increasingly being financed through use of foreigners’ savings rather than domestic savings.</p>
<p>But either way we have a major problem if, as happens in non-hard currency countries, the foreigners lose confidence and stop wanting our paper.  At that point we are in the same boat as <country-region><place>Argentina</place></country-region> and there are two things that will happen.  First, they either sell or quit  buying our paper, meaning that the exchange rate will fall.  Second, our interest rates spike, leaving us with two outcomes – a recession together with a far higher cost of borrowing for the government (and the rest of us).  At that point we will really really wish we had left ourselves with more capacity to borrow and more capacity to run a bigger deficit because we will need them badly to have a counter-cyclical fiscal policy such as Ed Prescott doesn’t believe in.</p>
<p>So that is my reasoning, and one of the reasons I get so wound up whenever I watch Congressional Republicans heedlessly running up huge deficits.  If my reasoning is correct then the road we are on is one which leads to an end to our reserve currency status since that is the implication of the day when “foreigners lose confidence and stop wanting our paper”.  It is worth repeating something I have said before – I am not predicting that this WILL happen.  I think the odds are still fairly low.  But the fact that the odds are big enough to talk about is shocking.  And there is a lot of room before that gloom and doom disaster scenario for the effects I am talking about to have an impact.</p></p>
