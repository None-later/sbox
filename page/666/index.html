                                <p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=03&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=middle_class_on_what_planet">Dean Baker</a> beats the press in the form of something about my neighborhood by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/29/AR2008032901117.html">Robin Shulman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Washington Post reports on a new trend for middle class white families with children to live in cities. The fourth sentence tells us that: &#8220;In the national imagination, it [Manhattan] was a place of artists, musicians, socialites, Wall Street bankers &#8212; or of hustlers, runaways, addicts, murderers. But it was not on the radar of the typical white, middle-class couple as a place to raise children.  Those who read a bit further will find that the median income for a white family with children living in Manhattan was $280,000 in 2005, roughly $300,000 in today&#8217;s dollars. That&#8217;s enough to place this family well up into the top 2 percent of the country&#8217;s income distribution.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s pretty clear to me as I walk towards the subway on the Upper East side that these families are affluent and Robin admits this.  So let’s move onto <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/03/30/ben-stein-watch-march-30-2008">Felix Salmon</a> watching <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/business/30every.html?_r=2&#038;scp=1&#038;sq=ben+stein&#038;st=nyt&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">Ben Stein</a> as Ben complains about how poor he has become:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fourth, plan for living more frugally. This is not easy for some of us. “What were once vices are now habits,” as the Doobie Brothers once said. This is true for millions of us, but we simply cannot escape the logic and power of arithmetic. We cannot live forever on more than we have in principal and interest (or earnings) and pensions. If that means no more second homes, or no more third cars, so be it.  No comfort is worth putting yourself in genuine fear of poverty. For me, your humble scribe, this is a vicious problem, but at some point, it must be solved.  But look on the bright side. My pal and investment guru Phil DeMuth and I have shown repeatedly that the best returns for stocks come after periods of extreme pessimism. It is just when the horizon seems darkest and cloudiest that we find above-par returns. And it is just when hopes seem dimmest for the United States that the economy starts to rally. If you have enough liquidity, if you are well diversified, now would be a good time to start back into the buying pool, in the most diversified way imaginable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah Ben – most people don’t have stock portfolios to fall back home.  Many people don’t own even one house – let along a house in Beverly Hills.  Some in my city don’t one own car and must take public transportation to work – assuming they have a job.  But let’s give the microphone to Felix:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stein is becoming a sick and unfunny joke at this point, and the NYT, by association, is the butt of that joke. Nick Kristof and many other reporters do a very good job reporting on real poverty for the New York Times; I hope they&#8217;re barraging their editors right now with complaints about how Stein is trivializing an extremely serious problem. Given the level of intellectual honesty that Stein displays in his new film, it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard at this point for the NYT to kill his column permanently.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many familiar names are in the comments. It is a great start to bringing economic theory out of the limits of a mechanistic approach that purports to explain human behavior but includes little of any other science in explanation.</p>
<p>While the article looks at some kinds of decision making for the poor, I also will have other works and ideas about &#8216;fair&#8217;, &#8216;wealthy&#8217;, &#8216;rich&#8217;, and &#8216;value&#8217;, &#8216;responsibility&#8217;. I do know our pithy sayings just don&#8217;t describe much. So it is well worth going over.</p>
<p>That can be the first admission of some kinds of ignorance, and a chance to take another look into the more real world of humans and their apparent messiness.</p>
<p>Update:<br />
<blockquote>[Charles] Karelis, a professor at George Washington University, has a simpler but far more radical argument to make: traditional economics just doesn&#8217;t apply to the poor. <a></a><br />When we&#8217;re poor, Karelis argues, our economic worldview is shaped by deprivation, and we see the world around us not in terms of goods to be consumed but as problems to be alleviated. This is where &#8230; bee stings come in: A person with one bee sting is highly motivated to get it treated. But a person with multiple bee stings does not have much incentive to get one sting treated, because the others will still throb. The &#8230; poorer one is &#8230; the less likely one is to do anything about any one problem. Poverty is less a matter of having few goods than having lots of problems.<br />Poverty and wealth, by this logic, don&#8217;t just fall along a continuum&#8230; They are instead fundamentally different experiences&#8230; At some point between the two, people stop thinking in terms of goods and start thinking in terms of problems, and that shift has enormous consequences. &#8230;</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>We may have good news with respect to the fighting in Iraq from <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2008/03/alsadr_pulls_fighters_off_iraq.php">AP News</a> but let’s first turn to a round-up of recent events provided by <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2008/03/mahdi-army-unsubdued-iran-asks-for-end.html">Juan Cole</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Iraqi Police surrendering to the Mahdi Army in Baghdad &#8230; Aljazeera English does a report on the fighting between the Iraqi government and the Mahdi Army. The video shows that the Mahdi Army is still in control of its Basra neighborhood strongholds … The Iranian foreign ministry called Saturday for an end to the fighting, saying that it strengthens the US hand in Iraq and may have the consequence of prolonging the US presence. Iran tends to back the Da&#8217;wa Party of Iraqi PM Nuri al-Maliki, and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, so it is significant that Tehran is criticizing this push by those two to destroy the Sadr Movement. I take them at their word. They are genuinely afraid that al-Maliki&#8217;s poorly conceived campaign will backfire and that Bush will use it to insist on keeping troops in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s see.  The Iranians believe that this Maliki assault on Sadr’s forces is backfiring on the Iraqi government and will be abused by the Bush Administration to prolong the US presence in Iraq.  It also appears that the government assault is not working all that well.  So what is AP reporting?</p>
<blockquote><p>Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said Sunday that he was pulling his fighters off the streets nationwide and called on the government to stop raids against his followers and free them from prison.  The Iraqi government quickly welcomed al-Sadr&#8217;s apparent move to resolve a widening conflict with his movementparked Tuesday by operations against his backers in the oil-rich southern city of Basra.  Al-Sadr&#8217;s nine-point statement was issued by his headquarters in the holy city of Najaf and broadcast through loudspeakers on Shiite mosques. It said the first point was: &#8220;taking gunmen off the streets in Basra and elsewhere.&#8221; He also demanded that the Iraqi government stop &#8220;haphazard raids&#8221; and release security detainees who haven&#8217;t been charged, two issues cited by his movement as reasons for fighting the government.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems Sadr is brokering a peace but with a price – that the Maliki government back off.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_03/013431.php">Kevin Drum</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>So apparently Sadr remains willing to continue his cease-fire, but only if Maliki stands down. In the meantime, he has no intention of giving up his weapons and has demanded the return of captured Mahdi Army fighters. Overall, this sounds likes it&#8217;s an offer to Maliki to declare victory and then leave town.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Maliki accepts this deal, his government will look weak.  If he declines this deal, no telling what will happen in Iraq.  Forgive me – but this looks like a lose, lose situation for the Maliki government. But <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-bush29mar29,1,110745,full.story">President Bush</a> thought the Maliki decision to invade was a great decision:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I would say this is a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq,&#8221; Bush said at the White House.&#8221;The decision to move troops, Iraqi troops, into Basra talks about Prime Minister Maliki&#8217;s leadership.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – we are ruled by an idiot.</p>

                                <p>With all the discussion about our plight money wise I thought it would be interesting to see just how distorted our view can become depending on what factor we choose as a comparison. Also, I find <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/">this site fun</a>.</p>
<p>So, just how do we compare today to the fondly remembered yesterday? I am very grateful to you for asking. Let&#8217;s see, we need a base. Let us use Social Security (OASDI to be complete) as a base dollar source. There have been suggestions that we need to raise the wage cap. OK, maybe, but what should it be? Using this OK, but what should it be?  Using <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/Content/PDF/ssrate_historical.pdf">this pdf chart</a> I picked 3 different years as starting points.  1937, because  “In the Beginning” there was poverty.  1966, because the beginning went so well, we added more.  And 1983 because we became enlightened .</p>
<p>Using the Measuring Worth site I produced this chart:<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/R_FHHV_0IxI/AAAAAAAAAHI/CEIsmKH2Vik/s1600-h/Social+Security+Wage+Base+chart.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/R_FHHV_0IxI/AAAAAAAAAHI/CEIsmKH2Vik/s400/Social+Security+Wage+Base+chart.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The 6 factors are explained at the Measuring Worth site. My short hand is: C Bundled = Consumer Bundle, Unskilled = Unskilled Wage. The N in NGDP stands for nominal.</p>
<p>So, what number do we pick? The one that shows the current cap is set way to high, so we obviously are covering too much in OASDI as compared to the past. Or the one that shows the current cap is too low, so we obviously are not covering as much in OASDI as in the past.</p>
<p>I vote for the one which shows that the $94,200 cap is about the proper income to be earned by the Unskilled Labor force allowing such a person to have maintained their standard of living based on the Consumer Bundle. Yet even at that, their share of GDP would be historically rather low.</p>
<p>Anyone recall me <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/this-is-continuation-of-looking-at.html">presenting an argument</a> that we have pushed the cost of the American Dream up to the point that one has to be in the top 10% of income earners to have it? It also takes 2 people working to do it.</p>
<p>In fact how uncanny that the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f07ar.html">median household income</a> in which the wife is not working, for 1967 (couldn&#8217;t find a number for 1937) converts to an Unskilled Labor income of $48,353 and the Consumer Bundle is $51,019.</p>
<p>Maybe we shouldn&#8217;t feel to bad. Based on Measuring Worth&#8217;s President George Washington example, the current President George is getting screwed by about $100K. But, this does not include the benefits received by the present George. Guess we are getting the short end compared to being president.</p>
<p>Saving the rustbelt goes beyond a geographic area. Saving the rustbelt is referring to a demographic group.</p>

                                <p>Angrybear has had a tradition of allowing a free flow of comments.  Other blogs have not and I find the following quite interesting.  From <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/27/boing-boings-moderat.html">Boing Boing&#8217;s Moderation Policy</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Q. What&#8217;s likely to land me in your bad graces?<br />A. Since you&#8217;ve asked, here&#8217;s a nowhere-near-exhaustive list:<br />1. Spamming. Linkwhoring. Re-posting text you&#8217;ve already posted on a dozen other sites.<br />2. Making supercilious and unpleasant remarks in a civil liberties thread about how the victim had it coming. This is not to say that victims never have it coming; but there&#8217;s a species of internet demi-troll that appears to specialize in posting such comments. Try not to look like you&#8217;re one of them.<br />3. Making snide comments and insinuations about the editors. That&#8217;s right out. You don&#8217;t like one of the editors? Take it up with them in e-mail. If you&#8217;re going to comment on an entry, talk about the entry.<br />4. Being nasty to no purpose. (This is the catch-all.)<br />5. Using unnecessarily exciting language. Making an argument is fine. Making your argument in language guaranteed to make your hearers see red? Bad idea. It practically guarantees that you&#8217;re going to have a dumb (and therefore boring) argument. And if the argument&#8217;s not going to be interesting, we don&#8217;t see the point.<br />6. Jeering, sneering, condescending, or one-upping when there&#8217;s been no provocation. Telling people they&#8217;re naive idiots for caring about whatever-it-is. Like the &#8220;I&#8217;m bored&#8221; pose, it&#8217;s empty attitudinizing, and it&#8217;s remarkably unpleasant.<br />7. Failing to notice that there are other people in the conversation. Posting a remark that&#8217;s already been made five times and answered six. Coming back and re-posting essentially the same material after a twenty-message thread has discussed your previous comment. Trying to forcibly wrench the conversation onto one of your own pet topics. Posting a stale, canned rant you&#8217;ve posted a dozen times before at other sites. Not coming back to see how others have responded to you.<br />Why post comments at all, unless you expect to be read? And if you expect to be read, you must know you&#8217;re part of a conversation. Therefore, you should act like it. Engage with what the other commenters are saying. Read the thread before you add to it.<br />8. Posting a snotty but otherwise worthless anonymous comment. It&#8217;s a lot easier to get away with snotty comments if you&#8217;re a registered user.<br />9. Dragging in one of those topics that&#8217;s guaranteed to generate a huge thrash that goes nowhere, like gun control, abortion, or Mac vs. PC vs. Linux. You&#8217;re only allowed to discuss those if (a.) they&#8217;re relevant to the entry; and (b.) everyone in the discussion is doing their level best to say something new.<br />10. This list will undoubtedly get longer.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Comments by Trolls and Asshats:</p>
<p>This may be a free country, but The Big Picture is my personal fiefdom. I rule over all as benevolent dictator/philospher king/utility infielder. Fear my wrath, mortals! <br />I will ban anyone whom I choose from posting comments &#8212; usually, for a damned good reason, but on rare occasions, for the exact same reason God created the platypus: because I feel like it. <br />I encourage a broad range of perspectives, philosophies, sexual orientations. Dissent is good. I want to see a debate of views, a battle in the market place of ideas. (Thomas Jefferson wasn&#8217;t so dumb after all). You can post on nearly anything, so long as it is at least tangentially related to the topic at hand. <br />On occasion, I will &#8220;unpublish&#8221; a comment if I feel it is too impolite, harsh, ad hominem, inappropriate, or off-topic. Off-topic posts have been rising, and I have taken to unpublishing them en masse. Publish too many comments on a given post (3 or 4 relevant comments out of 30 are fine, 10 out of 30 is excessive). It takes me ~10 seconds to un-publish 10 comments.<br />If you find yourself publishing way too many comments, consider this: This humble blog is my forum for expressing my ideas. Get your own damned blog.   <br />A few things that will get you permanently banned from commenting at The Big Picture. The fastest way to lose posting privileges is to misrepresent your host&#8217;s complex and nuanced views in some inane bumper sticker comment. Those who do this, be advised: I&#8217;ve read your prose and considered your thought process: Suffice it to say that Robert Frost&#8217;s legacy is safe. Your comments will not be missed. <br />Other fast tracks to getting banned: <br />&#8211; Knowingly posting false or malicious material;<br />&#8211; multiple postings under different names;<br />&#8211; generally engaging in troll-like behavior;<br />&#8211; misquoting your host/overlord;<br />&#8211; being impolite in the extreme;<br />&#8211; ad hominem attacks;<br />&#8211; being an asshole.<br />Right now, someone is reading this and saying to themselves &#8220;What does he mean, being an asshole?&#8221; If you wondered that to yourself, well the odds strongly favor that you yourself have sphincter-like qualities. Thus, you should consider it likely that you will be banned as a rectoid from posting comments sometime in the near future.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which experts?</p>
<p>If an agency is not looking, or actively praising instead of evaluating, I suppose they also would fail to recognize problems.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.alternet.org/environment/80508/">Alternet</a>, a leftist blog, carries this interview with Dr. Jansen, head of Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA&#8217;s premiere climate research center. So might that make it slightly left of center?</p>
<blockquote><p>DR. JAMES HANSEN: Well, my concern is general with both Republican and Democratic administrations. They both feel that they can control what scientists say to the public. So their offices of public affairs in the science agencies are headed, in general, by political appointees, and they review the press releases before they go out. So, it doesn&#8217;t really make sense in a democracy. The public should be honestly informed. And then, of course, the publications are allowed to make the decisions, and they don&#8217;t have to follow exactly what the science says. There are other considerations that they have. But they shouldn&#8217;t influence what is presented, the scientific evidence. And I object to that, regardless of which administration is in power.</p></blockquote>
<p>I posit that the Bush administration has been much better at bending the bureacracy to its political needs because of breadth of coverage, and the instituting positions of political screening in every department, albeit in a variety of guises (I have written on this several times).</p>
<p>I for one will be closely watching to see if any of the apparautus is dismantled with a new president. I am not optimistic, and am sure it will not be thorough.</p>
<p>Update: &#8216; former&#8217; was deleted</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I know it is not fashionable to praise former members of the Carter Administration but I have always admired how Zbigniew Brzezinski expresses his views.  While I don’t always agree with him – his latest on the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032702405.html">Iraq mess</a> is exactly right on several issues.  First &#8211; why did we invade Iraq?</p>
<blockquote><p>The case for U.S. disengagement from combat is compelling in its own right. But it must be matched by a comprehensive political and diplomatic effort to mitigate the destabilizing regional consequences of a war that the outgoing Bush administration started deliberately, justified demagogically and waged badly.</p></blockquote>
<p>President Bush did start this disastrous war for demagogic reasons, but Brzezinski has already moved onto whether we stay or go:</p>
<blockquote><p>Both Democratic presidential candidates agree that the United States should end its combat mission in Iraq within 12 to 16 months of their possible inauguration. The Republican candidate has spoken of continuing the war, even for a hundred years, until &#8220;victory.&#8221; The core issue of this campaign is thus a basic disagreement over the merits of the war and the benefits and costs of continuing it … The contrast between the Democratic argument for ending the war and the Republican argument for continuing is sharp and dramatic. The case for terminating the war is based on its prohibitive and tangible costs, while the case for &#8220;staying the course&#8221; draws heavily on shadowy fears of the unknown and relies on worst-case scenarios. President Bush&#8217;s and Sen. John McCain&#8217;s forecasts of regional catastrophe are quite reminiscent of the predictions of &#8220;falling dominoes&#8221; that were used to justify continued U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Neither has provided any real evidence that ending the war would mean disaster, but their fear-mongering makes prolonging it easier.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm – it seems John McCain has picked on the Bush-Cheney demagogy.  But wasn’t getting rid of Saddam worth it?</p>
<blockquote><p>Nor do the costs of this fiasco end there. The war has inflamed anti-American passions in the Middle East and South Asia while fragmenting Iraqi society and increasing the influence of Iran. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#8217;s recent visit to Baghdad offers ample testimony that even the U.S.-installed government in Iraq is becoming susceptible to Iranian blandishments. In brief, the war has become a national tragedy, an economic catastrophe, a regional disaster and a global boomerang for the United States. Ending it is thus in the highest national interest.</p></blockquote>
<p>But wouldn’t leaving now lead to an Al Qaeda victory?</p>
<blockquote><p>Contrary to Republican claims that our departure will mean calamity, a sensibly conducted disengagement will actually make Iraq more stable over the long term. The impasse in Shiite-Sunni relations is in large part the sour byproduct of the destructive U.S. occupation, which breeds Iraqi dependency even as it shatters Iraqi society. In this context, so highly reminiscent of the British colonial era, the longer we stay in Iraq, the less incentive various contending groups will have to compromise and the more reason simply to sit back. A serious dialogue with the Iraqi leaders about the forthcoming U.S. disengagement would shake them out of their stupor. Ending the U.S. war effort entails some risks, of course, but they are inescapable at this late date. Parts of Iraq are already self-governing, including Kurdistan, part of the Shiite south and some tribal areas in the Sunni center. U.S. military disengagement will accelerate Iraqi competition to more effectively control their territory, which may produce a phase of intensified inter-Iraqi conflicts. But that hazard is the unavoidable consequence of the prolonged U.S. occupation. The longer it lasts, the more difficult it will be for a viable Iraqi state ever to reemerge. It is also important to recognize that most of the anti-U.S. insurgency in Iraq has not been inspired by al-Qaeda. Locally based jihadist groups have gained strength only insofar as they have been able to identify themselves with the fight against a hated foreign occupier. As the occupation winds down and Iraqis take responsibility for internal security, al-Qaeda in Iraq will be left more isolated and less able to sustain itself. The end of the occupation will thus be a boon for the war on al-Qaeda, bringing to an end a misguided adventure that not only precipitated the appearance of al-Qaeda in Iraq but also diverted the United States from Afghanistan, where the original al-Qaeda threat grew and still persists. Bringing the U.S. military effort to a close would also smooth the way for a broad U.S. initiative addressed to all of Iraq&#8217;s neighbors. Some will remain reluctant to engage in any discussion as long as Washington appears determined to maintain its occupation of Iraq indefinitely. Therefore, at some stage next year, after the decision to disengage has been announced, a regional conference should be convened to promote regional stability, border control and other security arrangements, as well as regional economic development &#8212; all of which would help mitigate the unavoidable risks connected with U.S. disengagement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brzezinski does not pretend the leaving Iraq will be easy and he offers diplomatic steps that should be taken.  Alas, the current Administration refuses to listen to anything that makes sense.  Judging from the neocon nonsense from John McCain – he is not listening either.</p>
<p>Update: US forces are bombing Iraqis in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/world/middleeast/29iraq.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">Basra</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The American military conducted airstrikes Thursday and Friday to back up stalled Iraqi forces in Basra and battle Shiite militias in Baghdad as continued violence and political infighting worsened the prospects for any timely reconciliation among Iraq’s warring factions. Although American officials have emphasized that the campaign in the southern port city of Basra is directed by Iraqi forces, the Iraqis have failed so far to wrest control of neighborhoods in Basra from Shiite militias and asked the Americans and British to step in. The Iraqi military does not have jet fighters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Al Qaeda must see this as a huge PR victory.  Meanwhile, <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2008/03/iraqs_sadr_tells_followers_to.php">Reuters</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shi&#8217;ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has told his followers not to lay down their arms, rejecting a demand by the Iraqi government which launched a crackdown against them this week, a top aide said on Saturday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seriously – why do we leave our troops in the middle of this mess?</p>

<blockquote><p>Maybe we could wrap this whole Democratic nomination marathon up by having the candidates announce their choices for their running mates. I&#8217;m sure that might be some downside to this, but it can&#8217;t be any worse than what we&#8217;re seeing now. That way, whoever picks Joe Lieberman can be eliminated.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t give me that crap about how they haven&#8217;t decided on one yet. Anyone who has been thinking and then running for President for the past several years and doesn&#8217;t have an idea of who they would to join them on the ticket doesn&#8217;t deserve the job.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I don&#8217;t think many people can argue GW has had a succesful presidency.  This isn&#8217;t a partisan statement &#8211; I remember the Reagan, GHW Bush, and Clinton administrations, and this one is simply qualitatively different from those.  </p>
<p>The administration&#8217;s early <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">promises to pay down the federal debt</a> have been long forgotten.  The proud speeches about the &#8220;ownership economy&#8221; haven&#8217;t been heard in years.  Despite massive, perhaps unprecedented help from the Fed, and a compliant Congress which gave him just about everything he wanted, the fastest year of growth in <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls">real GDP</a> under GW was 3.6%.  To give you an idea how inadequate that is, under half the Presidents following the 1929 crash, FDR, JFK, LBJ, Carter, Reagan, and Clinton, the median annual real growth was faster than that.  GW&#8217;s best year would have been sub-par for half the Presidents in the sample!  If there&#8217;s an economic success story that GW will leave behind, its hard to imagine what it could be.</p>
<p>But economics isn&#8217;t everything.  Osama hasn&#8217;t been captured, dead or alive, though we do catch a glimpse on the occasional video.  Afghanistan isn&#8217;t going as promised, and neither is Iraq.  And then there&#8217;s diplomacy, about which the less said, the better.</p>
<p>So, with a year to go, thinking in terms of GW and his administration, what do you think will be the biggest successes and failures of the coming year?</p>
