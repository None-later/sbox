                                <p>Rdan here&#8230;The following post is the first of a possible four concerning shareholders, that magic group of owners of publicly traded companies which is invoked as beneficiaries of actions and policies by company officers and Boards.  While many readers are well versed in shareholder doings, we also have readers less versed in how this is done, hence Proxy Voting 101 at my request to begin.  But if you read news media, all is done for the sake of &#8216;shareholders&#8217;.  Lets begin the discussion.</p>
<p><strong>A guest post from Doug Gates, vice president and co-founder of Moxy Vote (www.moxyvote.com).</strong><br /><strong>Proxy Voting 101</strong></p>
<p>When you own something you generally expect to be able to control it. This is easy if you’re the only owner – “it’s my car, so I’ll decide when to change the oil.” It gets more complicated when there are multiple owners – “it’s our house, so ‘Honey? Is it time to fix our deck?’” This can create long discussions about budgets, priorities, plans and other issues. Now imagine there are millions of owners. You need to keep these owners informed about what they own and you need their input on big decisions. Organize this mob into a productive committee and you’ll be ready for work in corporate governance.</p>
<p>American companies ostensibly serve at the pleasure of their shareholders, so they periodically look to us for a nudge in the right direction. Our financial and regulatory system has developed the proxy voting process to deliver these nudges and give the shareholders a say.  </p>
<p>Here’s how it works in theory: companies assemble proxy ballots and distribute them to shareholders. Shareholders cast their votes, one per share, and the votes are tallied. The result is announced and the business moves on.</p>
<p>Of course, this well-intentioned process is never this easy. Let’s look at this piece by piece:<br /><a name="more"></a><br />1. Companies assemble proxy ballots. If you’ve seen a proxy ballot before, you know they don’t usually contain gripping, exciting information. Rather it has information on reelecting a director, appointing an auditor, designating a compensation committee, etc. In their proxy statements, companies recommend how you should vote on each of these.</p>
<p>If shareholders are particularly organized, they can submit their own ballot proposals on specific issues they are passionate about.  In general, shareholder proposals are due six months before the vote, they can’t deal with “ordinary business operations,” and are toothless. That’s right &#8212; they’re non-binding, although they do put public pressure on management. Shareholder proposals have been used to make statements on issues such as executive compensation, labor relations and global warming. Social activists like PETA and the Teamsters use shareholder resolutions, and they have also been used by activist investors like <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Icahn">Carl Icahn</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/10364142/grass-roots-activist-yahoo-just-the-start.html">Eric Jackson</a>. Most shareholder resolutions are rejected by voters.</p>
<p>2.  Ballots are distributed to shareholders. This is not nearly as easy as it sounds. For various reasons, many companies don’t even know the identities of most of their shareholders.  To distribute the proxy materials to unknown shareholders, companies hire a proxy distribution agent, who has relationships with all the brokers, funds and other intermediaries necessary to unravel the ownership chain. <a target="_blank" href="http://broadridge.com/">Broadridge Financial</a>, a $2.5 billion company, has a near lock on this market. The company sends proxy ballots to the distribution agent, who figures everything out and distributes them to shareholders. Companies can contact their known shareholders by getting their names from the transfer agent they’ve hired to maintain shareholder records.</p>
<p>3.  Shareholders cast their ballots &#8211; at least in theory. Most shares aren’t bought and sold by individual investors like you and me. They’re controlled by large institutional investors, such as pension funds and mutual funds. With thousands of proxy ballots to vote every year, most of these institutional investors hire a proxy advisory firm to recommend how to vote each ballot. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.riskmetrics.com/">MSCI</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.riskmetrics.com/">The Corporate Library</a> are among a handful of companies that compete in this space.  The large institutional shareholders vote because they have the obligation and the resources to figure out the best way to vote.</p>
<p>Small individual shareholders, like you and me, often choose to not vote. If you’ve ever received the thick packet of ballot legalese in the mail, you know why. It takes time and effort to vote when it appears to have little benefit. You can vote on a paper ballot, just like grandpa did, or you can vote via telephone or the Web.  </p>
<p>As a shareholder, you’re eligible to attend the company’s annual meeting, which can be a fascinating mix of administrative trivia and theatrics. Just weeks ago, <a target="_blank" href="http://walmartstores.com/shareholders/onlinearena/">Walmart entertained their shareholders</a> with pep rallies, speeches, the comedy of Jamie Foxx and musical performances by the Barenaked Ladies, REO Speedwagon and Tim McGraw.  16,000 people attended the closed-to-the-public festivities at the University of Arkansas’ Bud Walton Arena.</p>
<p>4.  Results. A few weeks after the voting deadline, the company announces the results of the vote, and the business moves forward.  Everything starts over in nine months as the next set of proxy ballots are distributed.</p>
<p>As you can see the proxy voting process is simple in theory, but a closer look reveals the complexities of the system and the difficulties individual shareholders face when desiring to vote and influence company management.  In our next post, we will discuss what’s wrong with the proxy process and how individuals can increase their participation and influence.  </p>

                                <p>This idea was lifted from an e-mail exchange with Noni Mausa this morning.  The following <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jokeoverflow.com/text-jokes/text-jokes-animals/wheres-my-parrot">well seasoned joke</a> reminds me of political communications among the people who write the copy for our leaders:</p>
<blockquote><p>A carpet layer had just finished installing carpet for a lady. He stepped out for a smoke, only to realize he’d lost his cigarettes. He went back in and in the middle of the room, under the carpet, was a bump. “No sense pulling up the entire floor for one pack of smokes,” he said to himself. He got out his hammer and flattened the hump.</p>
<p>As he was cleaning up, the lady came in. “Here,” she said, handing him his pack of cigarettes. “I found them in the hallway.”</p>
<p>“Now,” she said, “If only I could find my parakeet.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Part of Noni&#8217;s note</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is worrisome is that we don&#8217;t always correct our steering as we should, jumping back and forth between data, predictions, steering, more data and comparisons to our predictions.</p>
<p>But the biggest problem isn&#8217;t poor execution of good-faith strategies. It is clever execution of bad-faith strategies.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>All the fuss still ignores main driver of popularity says <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/06/21/obama_new_york_times_column/index.html?source=newsletter">Steve Korniak at Salon</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That&#8217;s because, for all the talk about whether he gave away too much on healthcare or hasn&#8217;t reacted angrily enough to the oil spill, Obama (like every president) is a prisoner to the economy. As long as the unemployment rate remains high, no amount of &#8220;magic&#8221; will restore Obama&#8217;s robust January 2009 poll numbers. (At this point, only some kind of international or terrorist incident, which might produce a rally-around-the-flag effect, could do so.)</p>
<p>It is absolutely not a coincidence that the basic themes of Blow&#8217;s column were also sounded by pundits in the first half of Ronald Reagan&#8217;s first term. Reagan, after all, was the last president to deal with double-digit unemployment. (His presidency also began with broad popularity, high expectations, and a souring economy &#8212; sound familiar?) At virtually this same point in his first term (August 1982), Reagan&#8217;s approval rating dipped to 41 percent. It was seen as a stunning decline for a man who had been elected in a 44-state landslide less than two years earlier. The unemployment rate when that survey was conducted was 9.8 percent, and trending upward. Today, it is 9.7 percent, with no substantial drop on the immediate horizon.</p>
<p>None of this is to say that Obama hasn&#8217;t made mistakes, possibly big mistakes, in his presidency. But they are not the reason why his poll numbers are where they are. Mass opinion doesn&#8217;t respond to the details of policy, no matter how important they might be. It responds to the economy. If the economy turns around, Obama&#8217;s numbers will, too. If it doesn&#8217;t, they won&#8217;t. There&#8217;s really nothing magical about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe voters overall do not allow nuance to impact their votes&#8230;it is a forced choice game anyway, which may or may not match up to personal thinking or feeling.  One of those major drivers is perceived performance and expectation of the &#8216;economy&#8217; personally or for people we know&#8230;examples of the focus on &#8216;economics&#8217; are everywhere, even if couched in other terms.</p>

<p>The announcement is being credited with about a 1% higher opening for the stock market and numerous pundits are claiming this will make a significant difference.</p>
<p>But this has happened before and it had little impact. From 2004 to 2007 the yuan appreciated some 20%.  But the net impact was about a 1% rise in the price index for US imports from China and essentially no impact on the US trade deficit with China.<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TB-FSsNIL5I/AAAAAAAABM0/zFmwzDpe1nI/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TB-FSsNIL5I/AAAAAAAABM0/zFmwzDpe1nI/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>So why should anyone expect a different reaction this time?</p>

<p><strong>Presidents, the Tax Burden and Corruption &#8211; Explaining Economic Growth</strong></p>
<p>One of the topics we cover in <ital>Presimetrics</ital> is the relationship between the tax burden (i.e., the share of income going to taxes) and economic growth.   As shown also in a <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=50">recent</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/06/presidents-tax-burden-and-economic.html">post</a>, Presidents who cut the tax burden tended to produce slower growth than Presidents who raised the tax burden.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to begin to address causality.   As we stated in the book and as I’ve since said a few times, I don’t think higher tax burdens in and of themselves cause faster economic growth, but rather that increasing tax burdens are correlated with some other criteria that create conditions that help produce economic growth.  </p>
<p>But let us start by addressing the issue of timing first.  A number of people have indicated in comments or offline that perhaps the reason for the strong correlation between tax burdens and economic growth could be because when the economy is growing rapidly, Presidents feel comfortable boosting taxes.  </p>
<p>I’ve pointed out a few a problems – theoretical and empirical &#8211; with this line of argument, but I think I can illustrate it best with a simple graph.  Since 1929, the first year for which data is available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) tables, there have been five Presidents that have served an eight year or more term:  FDR, Ike, Reagan, Clinton and GW.  Additionally, there are several more “quasi-eight year terms.”  These are instances in which a VP took over upon the death or resignation of the President and maintained a similar a policies similar to those of his predecessor (JFK/LBJ and Nixon/Ford), or in which a VP took over a mere few months into a new terms and thus could put his own stamp on just about the entire eight years (Truman).  </p>
<p>The graph below shows the change in the tax burden in the first two years of each administration on one axis and the growth in real GDP per capita during the remaining six years of each administration on the other axis. </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TB6t4LhE9NI/AAAAAAAAAMY/sichorNcZOg/s1600/pres1.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TB6t4LhE9NI/AAAAAAAAAMY/sichorNcZOg/s320/pres1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Notice…  increases in the tax burden in the first two years of an administration tend to be followed by rapid growth during the remainder of that administration.   Conversely, administrations that greatly decreased the tax burden during their first two years suffered from poor economic growth during their remaining six years.   This relationship, at least, is very difficult to explain by insisting that administrations which enjoyed rapid growth simply were more able to raise tax burdens than administrations which grew more slowly.   It is also impossible to explain by anything said by anything you hear out of the Austrians or the Chicago school.  </p>
<p>(Incidentally – I have a simple explanation for why some administrations appear above the regression line and some below.  I know that it applies to the administrations that begin in 1952 because I’ve written about it in the past.  I’ll collect the data going a bit further back and some time in the future will write a post on that.)  </p>
<p>So what is going on here?  Michael Kanell and I advanced several theories in <ital>Presimetrics</ital> but the one I think makes the most sense is that changes in the tax burden are a sign of the degree to which an administration enforces laws and regulations.   Consider this graph that appeared in a post last week:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TB6t4jOuyoI/AAAAAAAAAMg/zt00hgzOSS8/s1600/pres2.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TB6t4jOuyoI/AAAAAAAAAMg/zt00hgzOSS8/s320/pres2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2</p>
<p>Notice that among the Presidents to increase the tax burden are some who raised marginal tax rates (FDR, Clinton), others who decreased it (LBJ), and others still under whom marginal tax rates didn’t change.  Similarly, tax burdens fell under some Presidents who cut marginal rates (Reagan, GW), Presidents who raised marginal rates (Bush Sr.), and others who left it unchanged.  And for tax burdens to fall at a time of increasing marginal rates really requires  more people avoiding taxes they legally owe.  Similarly, for tax burdens to rise at a time of decreasing marginal rates one would need more people paying the taxes they legally owe.  Thus, enforcement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an administration willing to turn a blind eye toward one set of laws and regulations is probably more than willing to turn a blind toward other rules and regulations.   It is not a coincidence that aren’t keen on tax collection also tend to view the government as the problem and not the solution.</p>
<p>Now, corruption (and let’s call it what it is) is a tough thing for which to test.  But I think I there are signs that often appear among corrupt regimes, and one of them is the displacement of private sector by the government.  Running an honest business when the government is dishonest is very difficult.  The government will side with its favorites and everyone else will have a tough time.  It becomes easier to make a buck by playing legal technicalities than by actually doing something useful.  This is not to say that some countries do not succeed in having large government sectors without remaining honest and transparent – I suspect Denmark and Singapore are examples of that, though I’m not all that familiar with data for those countries.  But we are not Denmark, and if a regime populated with flacks who insist they believe in small government takes over a growing piece of the economy despite taking steps to &#8220;encourage the private sector&#8221; it probably isn&#8217;t a good sign.  </p>
<p>So with that… the next graph shows changes in the tax burden in years 1 and 2 on the one hand, and changes in the size of the federal government’s expenditures as a share of GDP during the remaining six years on the other hand. </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TB6t5fqCRVI/AAAAAAAAAMo/JW1FdG4NjMA/s1600/pres3.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TB6t5fqCRVI/AAAAAAAAAMo/JW1FdG4NjMA/s320/pres3.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3</p>
<p>Notice that administrations that started off by cutting the tax burden also went on to increase the government’s share of the economy.   That relationship is stronger and more evident if one looks at changes in the tax burden in the first four years of an administration against changes in the size of the federal government during the remaining four years.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TB6t63xuU2I/AAAAAAAAAMw/CiTXhZOS0UE/s1600/pres4.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TB6t63xuU2I/AAAAAAAAAMw/CiTXhZOS0UE/s320/pres4.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 4</p>
<p>Clearly, in general, the more an administration cut the tax burden in its early years, <bold>the smaller the private sector’s share of the economy it its later years</bold>, contradicting all rhetoric of the tax cutters, not to mention all Chicago or Austrian “economic theory.”   After all, those folks will tell you that lower taxes are going to jumpstart the private sector, right?  Not what happened in the real world, is it?</p>
<p>Notice also that the relationship is stronger for the four post-War Presidents that served a full eight years than for the entire sample.  A switch in administrations could lead to a break in our little “lower taxes as a sign of corruption shrinks the private sector” story.  I note also something else…  take a look at where FDR sits on the graph above.  Does that fit with the accepted FDR narrative in this day and age?</p>
<p>Which leads me back to corruption.  If cuts in the tax burden are a sign that the federal government is tolerating corruption, one would expect that administrations that start off by cutting that burden would end by seeing the private sector shrink relative to the public sector.  And that is precisely what we have seen.</p>
<p>Do you have a better explanation? </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Data sources and comments.</p>
<p>The definition of the tax burden used in this post is Federal government current receipts from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=87&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010"> line 1 of NIPA Table 3.2</a>divided by GDP from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=5&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010">NIPA Table 1.1.5, line 1</a>.  Real economic growth was measured as the change in real GDP per capita, which was obtained from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010">NIPA Table 7.1, line 10</a>.  The government’s share of the economy is measured the federal government’s current expenditures (line 23 of NIPA table 3.2) divided by GDP.  </p>
<p>Note that in past posts I have tended to only consider the first eight years of the FDR administration to avoid even getting close to the war years.   As noted in previous graphs, even leaving out the years after 1938, FDR oversaw the fastest economic growth or any President for whom there is reliable data available.  However, in this post, I was trying to remain consistent by sticking to 8 year stretches of data.  Note also that, as shown in the fourth graph, the federal government’s share of the economy actually shrunk from 1936 to 1940.</p>
<p>Growth rates are measured from the year before a President took office  to his last year in office. Note also&#8230; if its not obvious, this post deals with the tax burden, the share of GDP going to the Federal government, and not marginal tax rates.  Please do not insist on commenting on a topic unrelated to this post.</p>

<p><strong>Medicare Fee Ordeal &#8211; Continued</strong></p>
<p>As of Friday the Senate has passed a six (6) month patch to counter the Sustained Growth Rate formula cuts directed at most physicians.</p>
<p>The average for all physicians was a 21% cut, with changes ranging from primary care (+6%) to cardiology (-42%).</p>
<p>The House will consider the patch next week, and is likely to pass the necessary legislation.</p>
<p>CMS contractors will process claims from June 1 forward &#8211; someday. This will really help cash flow in medical practices.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong>PEANUT BUTTER REGULATIONS</strong></p>
<p>Watching people spread peanut butter is interesting.</p>
<p>I am a semi-neurotic peanut butter spreader, I try to cover most of the bread and try to get the thickness close to even, but I am not a perfectionist-neurotic spreader.  There are also slap-and-eat messy spreaders.</p>
<p>Having dealt with a wide range of government regulatory agencies over 35 years, dealing with both health care and small business, I am familiar with “peanut butter regulation.”</p>
<p>Peanut butter regulation spreads regulatory effort evenly over all regulated entities, even when it is well known that 20% of the targets represent 80% of the problems.</p>
<p>Nursing home regulation comes immediately to mind. Also food safety. And the SEC.</p>
<p>Regulation and regulatory capture are a hot topic these days. Do we need more targeted regulatory efforts?</p>
<p>Peanut butter regulation reminds me of drunk driving checkpoints, stop everybody and eventually the cops find a drunk. Is there a better way?</p>
<p>Some regulators are complaint based, such as wage-and-hour and  OSHA, should these agencies be more like peanut butter?</p>
<p>We gotta get better.</p>

<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit last month enjoined a Pennsylvania county prosecutor’s office from indicting teenage girls who had sued in federal court because their county’s prosecutor was threatening “sexting” indictments unless the girls agreed to attend a months-long class devised by the prosecutor to educate the girls about the prosecutor’s sense of sexual morality for teen girls. The case is Miller v. Mitchell. </p>
<p>The court’s opinion gained widespread attention in legal circles. And not only because it concerned the hot topic of teen sexting. The ruling was based, surprisingly, not on grounds specific to sexting but instead on the prosecutor’s interference with what the court said was the kids’ parents’ constitutional right to decide, free of state interference, what “ideas of morality and gender roles” their children will be taught. And on what the basis that the prosecutor’s indoctrination-by-extortion plan violated what the court said was the kids’ free speech rights to not be compelled by the state to write a mea culpa essay in conformance with the prosecutor&#8217;s sense of morality. </p>
<p>The opinion is being hailed as a civil rights victory. And it is a civil rights victory, but not just for the obvious reasons. Other civil rights advocates thought, “This is a big free-speech victory.&#8221; And, “This is a big parents’-rights victory.” Me? I thought, “This sets a blueprint for avoidance of the Younger doctrine.”</p>
<p>The Younger doctrine?</p>
<p>The Supreme Court regularly engages in the extracurricular activity of proclaiming court-created ‘doctrines’ that undermine the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the statute that is the main federal statute that provides for access to federal court in order to challenge the constitutionality of a federal, state or local law or government policy, or an action of a particular government official or employee. </p>
<p>One of those court-created doctrines is the “Younger abstention doctrine,” named for a 1971 Supreme Court opinion called Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37(1971), the case in which the doctrine originated. The essence of that doctrine originally was that, in the name of neo-federalist comity toward states, federal courts are required to “abstain” from hearing any civil rights claims brought by a person who is currently being prosecuted for a matter arising from that claim. The Supreme Court later expanded the doctrine to require the lower federal courts to abstain from hearing constitutional challenges to a state court’s procedural or substantive handling of civil cases during the pendency of the case in state court. The doctrine does have a few eye-of-the-judicial-beholder exceptions, which are rarely invoked.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The companion court-created Rooker-Feldman doctrine is (erroneously) interpreted by the lower federal courts to prohibit them from hearing such constitutional claims in civil lawsuits once the state-court case is over, ostensibly for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. (Rooker-Feldman will be the subject of a later article.) Habeas corpus law does allow challenges to the constitutionality of state-court criminal proceedings once the state-court appellate process is completed, but the two doctrines combine to effectively remove constitutional restraints from the judicial branches of state governments in civil cases. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court has never explained why it believes that these types of court-created federalist comity should apply to state judicial branches but not to the other two branches of state government. But I suspect it is a matter of professional courtesy. Or a matter of what they think they can get away with without dismay from the public. The very purpose of this jurisprudential “federalism” ideology is to flip the meaning of the Constitution’s Supremacy clause. </p>
<p>Justice Clarence Thomas, a professed originalist/textualist, speaks, for example, eloquently about what he and other federalists call the “dignity” of the states as sovereigns that will suffer humiliation by interference from a federal court. The dignity of the states trumps the dignity of the individual. Unless some specific right dear to his particular heart is at issue. Think Second Amendment. Or Fifth Amendment’s “takings” rights. </p>
<p>The kids who along with their parents sued in Miller were lucky. Had they waited until an indictment was issued, they could not have challenged the constitutionality of the criminal statute as it was being applied to them, and they could not have challenged the constitutionality of the prosecutor’s conduct, however bizarre and clearly violative of constitutional rights. The Younger doctrine would have prevented it. They would have had to endure a full prosecution and, if convicted, years of appeals, and if necessary, the years-long federal habeas process, in order to test in federal court the constitutionality of the prosecutor’s actions. Instead, because they filed their lawsuit before any indictment was issued, the legal process for them ended swiftly with a federal-court-issued temporary restraining order. </p>
<p>The moral of this story is that individuals who are in danger of prosecution under a statute they wish to challenge as unconstitutional, or who want to contest the constitutionality of the prosecutor’s conduct of the investigation, have a blueprint for avoiding the Younger doctrine: they can file their lawsuit under § 1983 before the indictment is filed in state court. </p>
<p>In civil (non-criminal) matters, though, the dignity of the states will have to rest upon the continued evisceration of § 1983 and the Supremacy Clause.</p>

<blockquote><p>But fundamentally, the debate is absurd.</p>
<p>It’s not the purpose of the private sector to protect the public. Companies like Goldman Sachs, Massey Energy, WellPoint, and BP will do everything they can to make money. They owe allegiance to their shareholders. Hopefully along the way they also make great products and provide terrific services. If the market is competitive, both consumers and investors gain.</p>
<p>The purpose of government is to protect and enhance the well-being of Americans. Its job is to protect the public from corporate excesses — enacting laws that bar certain actions that may hurt or endanger the public, and fully enforcing those laws.</p>
<p>We get into trouble when the two sets of responsibilities are confused – when big business and Wall Street spend vast amounts of money trying to influence government, and when government officials (including the officials of regulatory agencies) pull their punches because they’re aiming for lucrative jobs in the private sector.</p>
<p>The real challenge of our time has nothing to do with whether one trusts Big Business and Wall Street more or less than Big Government. The challenge is to keep the two apart, each focused on what they’re supposed to be doing. (That’s why, for example, I still think it unwise to have BP run the operation to plug the hole in the bottom of the Gulf.)</p></blockquote>
