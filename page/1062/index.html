                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Today&#8217;s <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">Consumer Price Index</a> report came in a bit higher than expected:<br />
<blockquote>On a seasonally adjusted basis, the CPI-U rose 0.6 percent in March, following an increase of 0.4 percent in February.  Energy costs advanced sharply for the second consecutive month&#8211;up 4.0 percent in March&#8230; The index for all items less food and energy, which rose 0.3 percent in February, increased 0.4 percent in March.</p></blockquote>
<p>This counterbalances yesterday&#8217;s Producer Price report, which showed a slight fall in inflation (on a 12-month basis) once food and energy are excluded.</p>
<p>But why do economists pay any attention to the &#8220;core&#8221; inflation rate &#8211; i.e. the rate excluding food and energy prices &#8211; in the first place?  The reason is not because the core rate more important than the overall inflation rate, but rather because it tells us something <em>different</em> from the overall inflation rate.  The general inflation rate tells us what is actually happening to consumer&#8217;s purchasing power.  That is important information, and the most relevant when considering certain types of questions (such as what&#8217;s happening to real wages).</p>
<p>But much of the variation in this rate is simply due to wild swings in food and energy prices.  So it is often the case the an uptick in inflation one month due to higher oil prices, for example, will simply be reversed the next month by lower oil prices.  The core rate therefore gives us a better sense of what the average inflation rate looks like over many months or years.  (Note that there are <a href="http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/inflation/US-Inflation/mcpi.cfm">other inflation measures</a> that do much the same thing.) The following chart illustrates.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/cpi_core1.jpg"></p>
<p>The core rate is much more stable than the overall rate, simply because food and energy prices are so volatile.  Sometimes the overall rate is higher than the core, sometimes lower&#8230; so if you read too much into what&#8217;s happening to the overall inflation rate you will often be mislead about inflation trends due to temporary blips.  For example, if one looked only at the overall rate, one might have concluded in late 2002 and early 2003 that inflation was moving dramatically higher, to around 3%.  But the core rate told us that that rise in overall inflation was likely temporary and would be reversed, as indeed it proved to be.</p>
<p>The other reason that the core rate matters is because it gives us much better insight into the underlying condition of the economy.  When the core rate is low, that suggests a broad-based lack of pricing power, which generally coincides with weak economic growth.  On the other hand, if the overall inflation rate is low, that could simply be due to a temporary fall in oil prices, which may have nothing to do with underlying economic conditions.  Similarly, a rise in the core rate, such as we&#8217;ve seen over the past year, provides a good indicator that firms are encountering growing demand.  </p>
<p>So while the overall inflation rate is useful if you just want to know what&#8217;s happening to individuals&#8217; purchasing power, it&#8217;s worth keeping your eye on the core rate too.</p>

                                <p>As <a href="http://plumer.blogspot.com/">Brad</a> was having fun with President Bush’s confusion in Ohio (“Risk, Return, Confusion”) he reasoned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Okay, so currently every working man and woman puts his or her savings in some combination of Social Security/the bank/the stock market/etc. These investments have total risk X and expected return Y. Now anyone who thinks Y is too low, and is willing to assume a risk greater than X can do so right this very instant. Just take, say, the money you&#8217;ve invested in T-Bills and put them in some riskier stock. Or sell of your risky stocks and buy even more riskier stocks. Or take money out of the bank and buy some junk bonds. The point is that almost anyone in America right now, it seems to me, could easily rearrange their current investments to assume an even greater risk and thus hope for an even greater return than they currently expect. If they so chose. The only thing they can&#8217;t invest somewhere else are their payroll taxes. Under privatization, people could do that. But if everyone is currently at their optimal level of risk X and return Y (as all perfectly rational people should be, otherwise one ought to take money out of the bank and buy junk bonds, etc.), if that&#8217;s true, then reinvesting payroll taxes in a riskier place with higher return shouldn&#8217;t make any difference. People will just shift other investments around until they&#8217;re back at X and Y.</p></blockquote>
<p>A commenter to Brad’s post point to a <a href="http://johnquiggin.com/index.php/archives/2005/02/16/emhss">John Quiggin</a> post, which makes the same point.  We have also noted that this is the point made by Robert Barro’s 7/3/2000 <em>Business Week </em>op-ed as well as Gary Becker’s 2/22/2005 <em>Wall Street Journal </em>op-ed.  Yet, the Cato-Club for Growth crowd continues to argue for a free lunch without ever addressing this question.  </p>
<p>Brad also makes the point often put forth by <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/">Mark Thoma</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, this argument has always been a bit disingenuous—the point of the program is the insurance aspect, not the return</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – increasing diversifiable risk does not increase expected return.  An increase in how much systematic risk one bears might increase expected return, but rational people already know that.  I guess the fact that the Cato-Club for Growth crowd does not understand basic finance speaks volumes.</p>

                                <p>Part one of the BLS&#8217;s monthly inflation check was released today: the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm">Producer Price Index</a> for March.  It shows a sharp but entirely expected jump, thanks to higher energy costs.  However, excluding energy costs, producer prices rose quite moderately.<br />
<blockquote> The Producer Price Index for Finished Goods advanced 0.7 percent in March, seasonally adjusted, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  This increase followed a 0.4-percent rise in February and a 0.3-percent gain in January.  As they did in February, prices for finished goods other than foods and energy edged up 0.1 percent in March.  At the earlier stages of processing, the intermediate goods index rose 1.0 percent, after climbing 0.7 percent in the prior month, and prices for crude goods turned up 4.3 percent in March, after declining 1.6 percent a month earlier.</p></blockquote>
<p>As usual, I will have more analysis and a graph following the CPI release tomorrow.</p>

                                <p>To help round out our series of posts on health care, I was going to survey the survey evidence about the public&#8217;s opinion of their health care system in various countries.  But <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_04/006142.php">Kevin Drum</a> has beaten me to it: check out his post for the story.  </p>
<p>The punchline: the US ranks 14th out of 17 countries for satisfaction with health care&#8230; but Americans who receive government-provided health care (i.e. the poor and the elderly) are significantly happier with their health care than the rest of us.</p>

                                <p>Angrybear reader Rob provides the shorter <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/does-everyone-gain-from-free-trade.html">PGL</a> to my side note on <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200504150850.asp">John Tamny</a>, which was critique #2 from <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/04/why_oh_why_cant_6.html">Brad DeLong</a>.  Rob writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shouldn’t any “economist” who confuses stocks &#8230; with flows  &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Tamny is not an economist and few of the NRO econopundits are.  But there may be a consistent definition of savings coming from Lawrence Kudlow and <a href="http://www.mosler.org/wwwboard/messages/2237.shtml">David Malpass</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not only are we not running out of household savings, it is growing fast both in terms of the annual additions and the cumulative buildup of American-owned savings. Household net worth, one good measure of savings, reached $48.5 trillion in 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>Malpass’s March 29, 2005 op-ed was better timed than a claim made by Kudlow a year earlier regarding record household net wealth.  The series they focus on can be found <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/Current/z1r-5.pdf">here</a> as line 42 in table B.100.  While nominal wealth was $44.583 trillion at the end of 2003, real wealth in terms of 2000$ (I’ll use the GDP deflator throughout) was $41.853 trillion versus $42.933 trillion at the end of 2003.  By the end of 2004, however, real household net wealth had risen to $44.478 trillion.  </p>
<p>While one could argue that this definition of wealth is incomplete as it leaves out factors such as the increase in deferred tax liabilities from the Bush fiscal irresponsibility, if we compare this 3.6% increase in real household net wealth to 5.2% rise in total population over the same period, real per capita wealth was lower at the end of 2004 than it was at the end of 1999.  The following chart compares real per capita wealth using the end of 1998 = 100 as its index.  What we see is a noisy series that increased by over 10% during 1999, fell as stock market valuations declined, but then recovered with a reversal in stock market valuations as well as rising values for home equity.  Our diagram, however, does not square with the Kudlow-Malpass-Tamny claim that households have saved a lot during the last five years.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/rw.jpg"></p>
<p>I’m not sure how the Clinton bashers of NRO might view this diagram?  They have in the past argued that it was Clinton’s tax cutting tendencies that led to the late 1990’s booms.  They have also suggested irrational exuberance was the reason for the surge in market valuations in the late 1990’s, but note the housing boom argument put forth by folks like <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/housing-after-boom.html">Calculated Risk</a>.</p>
<p>So what is the NRO’s out here?  Maybe it comes from the one person there who has a Ph.D. &#8211; <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_canto/canto200412100922.asp">Victor Canto</a>.  Rather than the usual NRO quibbling with whether their measure of some national income accounting measure is correct, Canto simply sums the two:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it the actual savings (an income statement) or the change in net worth (a balance-sheet item)? When one thinks about it, both will result in a higher net worth. If you take the sum of private savings and the change in net worth as a percent of GDP as the approximation of the true savings rate, by my account, that rate is on the order of 10 to 15 percent today</p></blockquote>
<p>The clever reader might go “aha – you are double counting”.  But his sleight of hand is more than that.  Earlier in his op-ed, Canto says net savings but his calculation is based on gross savings, which fails to deduct depreciation.  Yes, if one NRO approach to defining savings fails to yield a Bush cheerleading result, concoct another.</p>

                                <p>It seems that market sentiment has abruptly turned in the past week or two.  In late March the financial markets were abuzz with inflation fears.  Now, on the other hand, the business press abouds with stories about a coming economic slowdown (though worrying about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/18/opinion/18krugman.html?hp">stagflation</a> might make more sense).  Some examples: &#8220;<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/15/news/economy/slowdown/index.htm">Clouds gather on Wall Street</a>&#8220;; &#8220;<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B66177153-F3A8-4CBA-972E-6B0EAC7F5B30%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">Stocks got what they wished for</a>&#8220;; &#8220;<a href="http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3868421">Is the world economy running out of puff?</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/8ed600c4-afe1-11d9-ab98-00000e2511c8.html">Global equities slide on growth and earnings fears</a>&#8220;.  Partly in response, US stock markets fell broadly last week, losing about 3% of their value.  </p>
<p>Recent movements in the bond market typify this sudden change in investor sentiment, as the following picture illustrates.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/tnx2.jpg">
<div>Note: Chart shows yield on 10 year treasury bond over past 6 months; 45 = 4.5%, etc.</div>
<p>Just a little while ago, bond yields were marching rapidly higher; but over the past couple of weeks they have been falling just as quickly.  Have we learned anything new in the past couple of weeks?  No, not really.  Does April of 2005 mark the first time that many economists have worried about the sustainability of the current economic expansion?  No.</p>
<p>I have no good explanation for this seemingly bizarre (dare I say irrational?) behavior. Financial markets do overreact sometimes, and at times they go through unexpectedly large swings as a result of new information that was actually unsurprising, such as the release of the FOMCs minutes last week, or the FOMCs statement in March.  I think that such movements are often hard to explain if you believe in the perfect rationality of investors (rational overshooting models notwithstanding).</p>
<p>Should we care?  It&#8217;s tempting to dismiss this new collection of bearish stories as no more than hype, or the most recent &#8220;flavor of the month&#8221; in ever-fickle investor sentiment.  So I&#8217;d like to say no, we don&#8217;t need to care.  Except for this one inconvenient, insurmountable fact: developments in financial markets, such as interest rates and asset prices, can have strong and lasting effects on the real economy.</p>

                                <p>Is there a housing bubble?  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/housing-speculation-is-key.html">Yes</a>.  But what happens after the boom?  This post will address the likely bust in the housing market and next week&#8217;s post will discuss the possible impact of the housing slowdown on the general economy.</p>
<p>For those readers still uncertain about the housing bubble, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59515-2005Apr16.html">here</a> is an excellent article from the front page of today&#8217;s Washington Post. For those in denial, Dr. Shiller <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/economics/comment/0,11268,1461424,00.html">discussed</a> booms this week: &#8220;There are always popular explanations for the boom, but they are obviously not always right.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Housing &#8220;bubbles&#8221; typically do not &#8220;pop”, rather prices tend to deflate slowly in real terms, over several years. Historically real estate prices display strong persistence and are sticky downward. Sellers want a price close to recent sales in their neighborhood, and buyers, sensing prices are declining, will wait for even lower prices.  This means real estate markets do not clear immediately, and what we usually observe is a drop in transaction volumes.</p>
<p>Even though prices tend to deflate slowly, they can still drop significantly over time.  On the following graph are the nominal price declines for three busts: Los Angeles in the early &#8217;90s, San Antonio in the mid &#8217;80s (the oil patch bust) and Hartford starting in &#8217;89.  The peaks of all three housing booms are aligned on the left and the relative price declines are plotted by quarter after the local market’s price peak.</p>

<p><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>For all three busts, the prices steadily declined over many quarters.  Although these are three of the worst busts of the last 25 years, the price action is representative of other housing busts.  In real terms (adjusted by CPI less shelter), the price declines are even more dramatic:</p>

<p>Data Sources: OFHEO <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/HPI.asp">House Price Index</a>, BLS <a href="http://www.bls.gov/data/home.htm">CPI less Shelter</a>.</p>
<p>In real terms, prices in the Hartford market declined for over 8 consecutive years before reaching a nadir of almost 40% off the peak price of 1989.   The other markets experienced similar declines:<br />

<p>When the current boom ends, the coasts will probably experience the largest declines.  This boom is more widespread than previous booms according to an <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/fyi/2005/021005fyi.html">FDIC  report</a> released in February, and the bust will probably be more widespread too.  The FDIC reported: &#8220;Our count of 33 boom markets in 2003 is the highest witnessed at one time during the past 25 years—1988 ranks second, with 24 booms. Moreover, the 2003 boom markets account for roughly 40 percent of the nation&#8217;s population base, contributing to the impression that this is a nationwide phenomenon.&#8221; </p>
<p>All areas might not see declining prices, but transaction volumes will probably  decrease nationwide.  In the early &#8217;90s bust, the bubble areas like Los Angeles and Hartford saw declining nominal prices, but the nationwide nominal prices didn&#8217;t decline.  Nationwide real prices did decline about 8% over a 6 year period.  But more dramatic was the precipitous drop in the volume of New Home Sales at the start of the bust:  </p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/PriceSales.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/PriceSales.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Home builders tend to adjust to lower prices and New Home Sales rebounded after a few years.  Transactions of existing home sales are more susceptible to declining prices and stayed depressed for a longer period.</p>
<p>In summary, my expectation is for slowly declining prices in much of the United States and significantly lower transaction volumes nationwide.</p>
<p>What is the impact of falling prices and lower transaction volumes on the economy?  Obviously employment in real estate related occupations will fall.  This includes  Real Estate agents, mortgage brokers, home construction trades and other real estate related fields.  Also homeowners will withdraw less equity from their homes to use for consumption.</p>
<p>Next week’s post will discuss the possible impact of falling real estate related employment and less mortgage equity withdrawal on the general economy.</p>

                                <p>Angrybear readers might have already picked up on the fact that I am generally a free trade advocate.  One might then suspect I’d be praising the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200504150851.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a>.  But then Lawrence has to write:</p>
<blockquote><p>But you can blame U.S. textile makers. These businesses have been protected for nearly 30 years but they still can’t seem to compete. Why should consumers be denied choice simply because a handful of companies can’t cut the mustard? … Free trade helped all political parties and all world nations. It was not zero sum. It was &#8211; and is &#8211; win-win.</p></blockquote>
<p>I generally agree with Mr. Kudlow that free trade is not the cause of our current account deficits (never mind the fact that Kudlow supports the Bush fiscal trainwreck that is one contributor) and I’m hoping against all hope that this Administration does not impose duties on garment imports.  But the notion that everyone gains from free trade is not a credible argument – especially in parts of South Carolina.  </p>
<p>Memo to the National Review: leave the international trade issues to Bruce Bartlett and Bill Buckley.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Kudlow’s colleague <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200504150850.asp">John Tamny</a> just told Paul Volcker (and hence me as well) that Bush’s fiscal trainwreck is not a cause of the current account deficits.  You see – we are saving more according to this statistic:</p>
<blockquote><p>In it David Malpass (NRO financial writer and Bear Stearns chief economist) shows per capita assets in the U.S. of $89,800 that make us the top saving country in the world. (Japan is second at $76,900 per head.)</p></blockquote>
<p>This represents the level of assets whereas savings represents the increase in assets over time.  Real per capita wealth at the end of 2004 was lower than it was the end of 1999 for the U.S.  But neither Malpass nor Tamny get the point that their own measure shows we have had negative savings.</p>

                                <p>Now that you have sent more than your fair share to the IRS, you might be wondering why the Federal deficit is so high.  It turns out that when this clueless bear was <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/irs-budget-penny-wise-pound-foolish.html">praising</a> Bob McIntyre and Max Sawicky, they were part of a <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001310.html">conference</a> addressing this issue.  Max even provides pictures.  Shorter Max: allocate IRS resources less towards going after the working poor and more to where the real money is.  He also provides a link to <a href="http://www.epinet.org/newsroom/releases/2005/04/050411_McIntyre.pdf">Bob’s paper</a>.  Pages 11 to 13 are a very good discussion of transfer pricing manipulation, which includes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Or a company may have a very valuable asset, such as a trade name. If it transfers the ownership of that name to a low-tax place and then charges its taxable operations large royalties to use the name, it can avoid huge amounts in taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the game that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591840198/qid=1113517951/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-4414318-7674360">David Cay Johnson</a> mentioned in his chapter “Letters to Switzerland”.  Tax attorney <a href="http://www.bnatax.com/tm/insights_Reform.htm">Robert T. Cole</a> critiqued Johnson with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the chapters in Perfectly Legal is entitled “Letters to Switzerland” in which Johnston alleges that a U.S. corporation can reduce its taxes by mailing the rights to intellectual property (IP) to a country that imposes no tax or a low rate of tax generally (or on the type of income which U.S. multinationals might locate there) in exchange for a payment that is far less than the true value of the transferred IP. Johnston notes that under the law “the price has to be reasonable,” but then goes on to give an example of a price that he regards as far less than reasonable and suggests that undervaluation is the norm. Whatever may have been the situation before and in individual cases, there are in place rules (and stricter enforcement) that should in most cases prevent the transfer of U.S. IP to foreign affiliates without full consideration. In 1982, §367(d) was added to the Internal Revenue Code to prevent transfers of U.S. IP for stock and in 1986 §482 was changed to add the commensurate-with-income standard for the transfer (or license) of intangibles to a related party. Thus, the Code now requires that a U.S. taxpayer take into account the full value of U.S. intangible property transferred overseas.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cole is assuming that the “economist” working for the taxpayer provides an honest estimate of the value of the intangible asset.  But we often see “analyzes” where an intangible asset that generates high royalties is supposedly worth very little.  How?  By assumptions of discount rates that are so high or economic lives so short that even Lawrence Kudlow would refuse to publish the rubbish at the <em>National Review</em>.  </p>
<p>But when economists turn into hacks, the attorneys for both the taxpayer and the tax authority decide they are not worth very much.  Joe Garrett, a tax policy attorney with the Alabama Department of Revenue, has this neat <a href="http://www.mtc.gov/2004AnnualConferenceAgenda_files/Garrett.pdf">presentation</a> of how the game is blame at the state level.  Slide 6 asks “Is my economist better than your economist?”  What Joe is saying he has no use for economists who play what is known as the Comparable Profits Method (CPM) game.  You might ask – what is CPM?  It’s more rubbish to bait and switch the tax authorities into giving a pass to aggressive tax plays.  So why would any economists working for the tax authorities play the CPM game.  Perhaps poor training?</p>
<p>But there is another cost of this game playing.  Max noted some bizarre hearings held by Senator Roth:</p>
<blockquote><p>His staff staged a parade of witnesses who recounted horror stories of mistreatment at the hands of the IRS. The hearings led to legislation constraining IRS enforcement efforts, and pushing them to chase after the low-wage workers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p></blockquote>
<p>One might scoff at the notion that the taxman abuses multinationals.  Perhaps, but there are some multinationals that simply wish to avoid double taxation without enormous compliance costs.  Arm’s length pricing could be easy for them if they could find a smart and honest economist.  If they cannot, this pathetic game played by the enablers of tax cheats also tends to interfere with free trade.  Tax revenues are lost, honest taxpayers face absurd regulatory nonsense, and the economics profession is scoffed at by the tax attorneys who play the pesudo-economists for whores.</p>
