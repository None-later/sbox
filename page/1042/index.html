                                <p>The release of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2006/pdf/06msr.pdf"><em>Mid-Session Review</em></a> of the 2006 budget by the White House today was accompanied by a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/pubpress/2005/factsheet_msr.pdf">press release</a> full of dubious claims.  Each point in the press release contained its own misleading or incorrect spin on the budget.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM #1:</strong> <em>&#8220;The Improved Fiscal Outlook Is Directly Tied To The Strength Of The Economy. With the help of tax relief, the U.S. economy is growing at a healthy pace, creating millions of new jobs and increasing business investment.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Of course, it is certainly true that government tax revenues, and thus the country&#8217;s fiscal outlook, depends directly on the strength of the economy.  However, it is an unlikely and unproven claim to assert that the economic recovery was helped by tax relief.</p>
<p>Tax relief probably had little or nothing to do with the growth of the US economy over the past few years.  As the following chart shows, the economy has grown much more slowly under the Bush administration than after the average post-war recession, despite tax cuts in 2001 (the “recession year”) and 2003 (“R +2”).  In fact, the current recovery is no better than the recovery from the 1991 recession, even though that recovery faced more rapid increases in interest rates by the Fed (300 basis points in 18 months, compared to 200 basis points in 18 months during this recovery).  So from this <em>prima fasciae</em> evidence, it’s hard to see that the Bush tax cuts have made any discernable mark on economic growth.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/msr1-709491.jpg"></p>
<p>What did more sophisticated economic modeling predict for the supply-side effects of the tax cuts?  As I mentioned in the previous post, the best estimate by the Congressional <a href="http://www.house.gov/jct/x-105-03.pdf">Joint Committee on Taxation</a> (JCT) in 2003 was that the supply-side boost from the Bush tax cuts may (using optimistic assumptions) increase GDP growth by 0.3% per year for a few years.  Note that this effect was predicted to disappear, or even be reversed, after 2008.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=4454&#038;sequence=0#pt2">Congressional Budget Office</a> (CBO) published the results of a similar exercise in July 2003, in which they used several different macroeconomic models – specifically incorporating forward-looking supply-side reactions in the economy to the tax cuts – to estimate the growth effects of the tax cuts. Using the assumption that future government spending would be cut to try to balance the budget, five of the six supply-side models they used predicted that the Bush tax cuts would reduce, rather than increase GDP growth.</p>
<p>The economic models thus suggest that it is likely that the Bush tax cuts had a tiny or even negative effect on economic growth.  Judging by actual GDP growth of the past few years, those models seem to have been about right.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM #2:</strong> <em>&#8220;Growing Economy Is Producing Greater Than Expected Revenues. The Mid-Session Review projects tax receipts will rise 14 percent from last year – the largest such year-over-year increase in 25 years. Receipts are on pace to rise $87 billion more than expected last February; spending was $7 billion less than expected.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Tax revenues have indeed risen quickly in the past couple of quarters.  But as I illustrated in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/budget-nonsense-from-white-house.html">the previous post</a>, if it weren’t for the Bush tax cuts, they would have grown even more quickly, and erased even more of the budget deficit.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, the degree to which this relative improvement in the budget picture is “unexpected” is debatable.  The following table shows the White House’s forecasts for the budget deficit (in billions of $) and GDP growth in 2005 and 2006.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/msr2-713996.jpg"></p>
<p>Today’s much-trumpeted forecast of the deficit of “only” $333 billion is actually right in line with most of the projections for the 2005 deficit that the White House has made over the past few years, with the exception of the outlier of January 2005.  Meanwhile, today’s forecast for the budget deficit in 2006 does not look like much of an improvement at all over earlier forecasts.  </p>
<p>Based on the White House&#8217;s own forecasts, it&#8217;s hard to see that recent budget news contains any unexpected improvements in economic growth or the budget picture.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM #3:</strong> <em>&#8220;The Projected Decline In The Deficit Includes Anticipated Costs. The new deficit forecasts take into account full extension of tax relief, war spending in 2005 and a substantial part of 2006, and the expected financing impact from creating voluntary personal retirement accounts under the President’s Social Security reform proposal.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>First of all, I find it odd that the White House is so proudly trumpeting the fact that this forecasts of the US budget actually &#8220;includes anticipated costs.&#8221;  Isn&#8217;t a budget forecast <em>always</em> supposed to do that?  It&#8217;s sad that this is news.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this budget forecast still fails to include several important and fully anticipated costs.  </p>
<p>First of all, today’s projections assumes that non-defense discretionary spending will grow at between 1.7% and 1.2% in nominal terms (which translates into a cut of about 1% per year in real terms) from now until 2009.  This is despite the fact that such spending has grown by between 5% and 10% every year since 2001.  Even if they just made the optimistic (from a budgetary point of view) estimate that non-defense discretionary spending would grow no faster than inflation, that would add $80 to the budget deficit through 2010.</p>
<p>Secondly, today’s projections assume just $37 billion in expenses for Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006, $10 billion in 2007, and virtually zero thereafter.  By contrast, the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6067&#038;sequence=0">CBO estimated</a> that continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, even with a gradual withdrawal or US troops from that part of the world, would cost $50-$80bn per year through 2008, and over $25 billion per year thereafter.</p>
<p>Thirdly, today’s projections assume that nothing is done to fix the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), a problem that nearly all budget-watchers recognize will need to be addressed within the next couple of years.  By ignoring the AMT problem, the White House is again dramatically understating likely future budget deficits &#8211; by some $170 billion over five years, according to the CBO.</p>
<p>If you add these missing &#8220;anticipated costs&#8221; to the White House estimates of the budget deficit, and put aside the social security surplus to focus on the &#8220;On-budget&#8221; budget balance, you find that there is no significant reduction in the budget deficit in sight, as the following chart illustrates (figures in billions of $).</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/msr3-725057.jpg"></p>
<p>The US government will have to borrow about a half a trillion dollars in 2005 to fund its general operations, and keep borrowing an additional half a trillion dollars each year for the forseeable future.</p>
<p>For some reason, the White House seems to be proud of the budget update that it released today.  But the faulty logic, evidence-free reasoning, and misleading assumptions embodied in it cause me to feel nothing but disappointment about this budget report.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Bush administration has spent much of the past two days <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/pubpress/2005/factsheet_msr.pdf">claiming</a> that the tax cuts are responsible for the recent <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/07/13/news/economy/budget_deficit.reut/index.htm">surge in government revenues</a>.   </p>
<p>But this is nonsense.  The fact that government tax collections are rising during a time of economic growth is, at the very least, unsurprising.  If the White House wants to take credit for a falling budget deficit, then they need to make the only comparison that really matters, and one that they have been studiously avoiding: what is today’s budget deficit <em>compared to what it would have been without</em> the Bush tax cuts?</p>
<p>Since they&#8217;re unwilling to do so, let’s make that comparison for them.  In fact, since I’m in a generous mood today, let’s suppose for a moment that we gloss over a host of theoretical problems with the argument of the supply-siders (e.g. their evidence-free assumption that substitution effects of tax cuts outweigh income effects) and buy their dubious argument that the tax cuts caused supply-side economic growth.  </p>
<p>Even with such supply-side optimism, the budget deficit today is much higher than it would have been without Bush administration tax policies.</p>
<p>In January of 2003 the Republican Congress stipulated that its own tax specialists, the Joint Committee for Taxation (JCT), must prepare “dynamic” analyses of all tax legislation – i.e. analyses that include supply-side gains that may reduce the tax burden of any tax cut.   We can use these estimates to get at the supply-siders’ best-case scenario for the effect of the Bush tax cuts on the budget deficit.</p>
<p>In December 2003 the <a href="http://www.house.gov/jct/x-105-03.pdf">JCT estimated</a> that when supply-side macroeconomic effects of the 2003 tax cuts were taken into consideration, the tax cuts would indeed cause an offsetting revenue gain by stimulating economic activity.  However, they estimated that the positive supply-side effects on the economy would boost real GDP growth by only 0.2-0.3% per year during 2003-08.  They then estimated that this benefit to the economy would mean that the revenue losses from the tax cut were estimated to be only around 75-90% of what they would otherwise be.</p>
<p>The following chart shows what this means for the budget deficit.  The blue bars show the Bush administration’s most recent budget deficit forecast – the one that they were crowing about today.  The orange bars show the budget forecast if the Bush tax cuts had never happened, according to the estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, calculated by simply summing the CBO’s estimates of the revenue effects of each of the Bush tax cuts.  The purple bars show what the budget deficit would have been without the Bush tax cuts, <em>even if you believe the supply-siders</em> and use the JCT&#8217;s “dynamic scoring”, which assumes that without the tax cuts the economy would have grown more slowly. </p>

<p>The White House is proud of the fact that their tax policies have caused the budget deficit forecasts to improve, so that this year’s deficit will be only $333 billion.  Yet without their misguided tax cuts, the budget deficit today would be in the neighborhood of $100 billion instead, and heading toward balance within another two years.</p>

                                <p>While it has been a while, let me start by thanking Kash for his post on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/us-vulnerability-to-china.html">CNOOC bid to buy Unocal</a> as well as his various posts that discuss the benefits of free trade.  The NRO has even featured very good defenses of free trade from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/buckley/wfb200503021122.asp">William Buckley</a> and <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/bartlett200506290858.asp">Bruce Bartlett</a>.  I was hoping to say the same thing about the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200506241442.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> with his colorful title “The Insanity of Smoot Schumer and Hawley Graham”.  Alas, Kudlow spent more time of this theme:</p>
<blockquote><p>This rhetorical question was asked by economist Arthur Laffer last week in connection to an unprecedented attack on China trade by numerous U.S. senators. In response to the China bashing, the stock market plunged … Art Laffer argues that a stable yuan linked to the dollar has promoted strong economic growth at low inflation for the U.S., China, and the rest of the world … Think of the dollar-link as China’s gold standard … Ironically, since the dollar has been floating freely, the dollar-linked yuan has also floated compared to a market basket of currencies. Between 1995 and 2001 the yuan-dollar appreciated by nearly 50 percent and in recent years has fallen by about 30 percent. Both the U.S. and China adjusted internally to deflation and inflation. But the common link between the two has given the yuan global financial confidence while at the same time giving the U.S. enormous leverage over the Chinese economy. What’s wrong with that? We buy their goods and they invest in our country through the purchase of Treasury bonds and more recently through direct investment in large U.S-based corporations (like Maytag and Unocal). </p></blockquote>
<p>First of all – for all the NRO’s devotion to every word written by Art Laffer, why can’t they identify what Laffer paper they refer to?  Secondly, U.S. monetary policy is neither tied to the price of gold nor should it be.  Perhaps, Kudlow should review these words from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200506240838.asp">John Tamny</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>given the rise in the price of gold from $255 in 2001 to roughly $435 today … from 1996 until 2001 &#8211; a time in which the price of gold plummeted from roughly $385 to $255.</p></blockquote>
<p>If one looks at the bottom right of <a href="http://www.kitco.com/charts/historicalgold.html">this webpage</a>, one can plot gold prices and see Tamny at least got the data right.  Even though gold prices fell during the late 1990’s, I would not argue that monetary policy should have been more expansionary.  And even though <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/06/does_the_increa.html">Mark Thoma</a> seems to be more comfortable with recent FED tightening than I am, he is not saying the FED should try to reverse the recent rise in gold prices.  </p>
<p>Kudlow argues that Chinese inflation roughly tracks U.S. inflation.  Reported inflation in China has been less than reported inflation in the U.S. over the past several years per <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2005/01/pdf/statappx.pdf">this IMF report</a>, but one could argue that the official statistics understate Chinese inflation.  The IMF data also shows that China’s monetary growth rates have been double-digit since 1997, which is what one would expect under a fixed exchange rate regime where China has consistently run current account surpluses, while the U.S. has consistently run current account deficits.  </p>
<p>And yet Kudlow’s whole argument seems to be that we should retain the current exchange rate peg.  His claim seems to be that Chinese real GDP growth, which has been in excess of 8% per year since 1997, is due to its pegged exchange rate.  Yet, the IMF also reports that real GDP growth in China averaged 10% per year from 1987 to 1996.  The current exchange rate peg has not been in place for this entire period.  Additionally, fixed exchange rates are neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for macroeconomic stability.  While a yuan revaluation might be in order to reduce China’s current account surplus, the impact on U.S. net exports is likely to be quote modest.</p>

                                <p>Part V will be my final post on this for several reasons including the possibility that the rightwing reaction to the news that Karl Rove may indeed be the traitor has reached its pinnacle of dishonesty and hypocrisy.  As evidenced by this <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110006955">WSJ editorial</a>, they wish to grant Rove a medal of honor for being a traitor.  If you are trying to count the lies in this editorial, maybe we should thank AB reader AB Initio for the piece from <a href="http://noquarter.typepad.com/my_weblog/2005/07/the_real_outrag.html">Larry Johnson</a>.  Mr. Johnson sums up this entire issue quite nicely.</p>

<p>The AP story included this from Ken Mehlman:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ken Mehlman said Rove was the victim of partisan political attacks by Democrats. Rove &#8220;was discouraging a reporter from writing a false story based on a false premise,&#8221; said Mehlman. Cooper&#8217;s e-mail says that Rove warned him away from the idea that Wilson&#8217;s trip had been authorized by CIA Director George Tenet or Vice President Dick Cheney.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Whether every single word from Joe Wilson is 100% accurate is not the issue.  The issue is that Karl Rove committed a treasonous act and then lied to cover up his transgression.  And as <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_07_10.php#006069">Joshua Marshall</a> notes – on many of these alleged points, it is not Joe Wilson who lied as folks like Mr. Mehlman are lying.  </p>
<p>Phase IV seems to be blame the Democrats and it seems the White House has <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200507120006">Kyra Phillips</a> as their CNN stooge.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/">John Podhoretz</a> must think he is really clever:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is important, because it suggests Rove wasn&#8217;t &#8220;retailing&#8221; the information about Wilson and Plame &#8211; wasn&#8217;t reporter-shopping to drop a dirty dime on those involved &#8211; but was rather a passive source, answering a phone call at the reporter&#8217;s behest and presumably changing topics to the sexier one at issue at the reporter&#8217;s behest as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>Passive – not active?  Wholesale instead of retail?  I have some career advice for John Pod – don’t even try to be a lawyer if such pointless distinctions are the best you have to offer.  And it’s very clear that the National Review has little interest in either the rule of law or national security.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Should the Fed continue to raise interest rates?  Should they raise them faster?  Typically economists presume that the central bank cares about two things when deciding how high interest rates should be: the output gap, which tells us how far the economy is from some notion of &#8220;full employment&#8221;, and inflation.  The Taylor Rule is one slightly more formal way of expressing the intuition that these two indicators should tell us whether current interest rates are too high, too low, or just right.</p>
<p>But measuring these two variables is not easy.  Last week PGL did <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/are-we-near-full-employment_06.html">a nice job</a> discussing some of the difficulties in estimating exactly how large the output gap is in the US economy right now, with <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/james-hamilton-on-decline-in.html">a follow-up</a> over the weekend.  Even among economists who think carefully about this issue, there&#8217;s substantial disagreement about how large the output gap is right now.</p>
<p>But it turns out that it may be at least as difficult to estimate the other key factor affecting monetary policy decisions: the inflation rate.  (Warning: the rest of this post is a bit long and wonky.)</p>
<p>There are several potential problems with the way inflation is measured in official statistics.  Measuring average price changes of thousands of very different goods and services is an enormous task, after all, and there are no clear ways to resolve many of the difficulties involved.  </p>
<p>But recently, the US government&#8217;s official measures of inflation in housing have drawn increasing criticism specifically for understating the impact of the rise in house prices on the cost of living.  According to the BLS&#8217;s <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm">Consumer Price Inflation</a> measure, the cost of shelter has risen by only 2-4% per year over the past couple of years.  Yet we all know that the price of houses has risen by far, far more than that recently. According to the widely-cited <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/HPI.asp">House Price Index</a>, house prices have risen by 12.5% over the past year across the US as a whole, and risen by 20% or more in many metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>The discrepancy is explained by a number of factors, but the biggest is simply this: the BLS measures the price of housing services as the rent that a household would have to pay for an equivalent living space.  And inflation in rents has indeed remained low in recent years, despite the run-up in housing prices.</p>
<p>The following pair of charts illustrates.  The first shows the price index for shelter in the four Census regions of the US over the past 20 years according to the CPI&#8217;s &#8220;rental-equivalent&#8221; measure.  The second chart shows an index of the monthly payments that an individual would have incurred in any particular year when buying a house of a constant level of quality. (In this case, the benchmark is a house with all of the features of the average house sold in 1996.)</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/housecost1-789908.jpg"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/housecost1-788653.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/housecost2-722636.jpg"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/housecost2-721274.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Note: Constant-quality house price index from <a href="http://www.census.gov/const/www/constpriceindex.html">Census.</a>  &#8220;Cost of buying a house&#8221; reflects the monthly payment needed to buy an average 1996 house using the average 30-year mortgage rate for the year.  2005 data assumes a 5% price appreciation over 2004 prices, and uses the average Jan-Jun 2005 mortgage rate.</p>
<p>Clearly the two measures are wildly different.  Much of the variation in the second chart comes from changes in the interest rate, which changes the monthly mortgage payment entailed by the home purchase.  But over the past few years the 30-year mortgage rate has remained roughly constant, and rents have risen only modestly, while the cost of buying a house has actually risen substantially.  That&#8217;s the effect of the recent sharp rise in house prices.</p>
<p>This means that the inflation experienced by people who have bought a house in the past couple of years is probably considerably higher than the inflation measured by the CPI.  It&#8217;s worth noting at this point that typically 40-50% of households in the US move to a new house during any 5-year period, so the fraction of the US that has experienced this greater-than-measured inflation is not insignificant.</p>
<p>Note that the BLS&#8217;s decision to use the &#8220;rental-equivalent&#8221; cost of shelter instead of the actual cost that individual&#8217;s incur in their housing makes sense in a lot of ways, for example by keeping temporary fluctuations in interest rates from showing up in the CPI.  And when compared over many years (such as in the charts above), the CPI measure actually have may <em>overstated</em> the inflation rate in shelter.  </p>
<p>But recent history highlights this potential drawback of the &#8220;rental-equivalent&#8221; measure of housing inflation: it assumes that the cost of renting and owning move at least roughly in step with each other.  And that has clearly not been the case in recent years.</p>
<p>This makes the job of estimating the inflation rate in the US even tougher than usual.  While official inflation measures show rates of about 2-3% over the past year, that certainly doesn&#8217;t correspond to the experience of a large fraction of the US population.  Which just makes the Fed&#8217;s job of balancing inflation concerns against the output gap that much tougher.</p>

For good rebuttals, see <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/07/some_simple_fis.html">Mark Thoma</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/11/opinion/11krugman.html?">Paul Krugman</a>.  Of course, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200507120940.asp">Donald Luskin</a> has attempted a rebuttal of Krugman.  </p>
<p>Luskin cannot deny that tax revenues have fallen so he provides a graph of projected nominal Federal tax revenues where revenues in 2009 was projected to be 10% higher than they were in 2000.  You might be wondering what his graph would have looked liked had it been constructed in terms of real Federal revenues per capita.  Our graph shows the 1991 to 2004 historical record.  And if one deflates the 2009 estimate by prices and express it in per capita terms, projected real Federal revenues per capita for 2009 would still be below the 2000 level.  Mr. Luskin knows this but he’s hoping his readers are too stupid to understand the simple point.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Apparently this is the HOT job in California. Over the last 12 months, the number of licensed real estate agents in California has climbed 14% to almost 450,000. Here is the year over year percentage growth in Real Estate agents by quarter.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/REagent.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/REagent.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>Maybe California needed more agents. Here is a simple calculation: Currently there are about 620,000 homes sold per year in California <a href="http://www.car.org/index.php?id=MzUxNTg=">according</a> to the California Association of Realtors (CAR). With 450,000 agents, there are about 1.4 homes sold per agent. CAR doesn&#8217;t report the average sales price, but the median home price in California last month was $522,000. If we round up to $600,000 for the average price that would give $840,000 in sales per agent or about $40,000 in commissions (at 5%).  NOTE: There are 1.4 sales per agent and 1.4 listings per agent. I combined the listing and sales agent to obtain the average commissions.</p>
<p>The agent has to split the commissions with their broker and many agents in California pay expenses, but that is still a reasonable income, especially considering that the barriers to entry are very low.</p>
<p>And touching on that theme, from the NY Times yesterday: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/09/realestate/09complex.html">Boom in Jobs, Not Just Houses, as Real Estate Drives Economy</a>.<br />
<blockquote>Unlike other industries that have boomed recently &#8211; health care and technology in particular &#8211; real estate has the advantage of relatively low barriers to entry. A college degree, let alone one from a medical or business school, is not a prerequisite for a middle-class income &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>  Although some construction trades require substantial skill and take several years to master, most real estate related jobs require limited special training or special skills.  This is potentially a huge problem.  When the housing boom ends, many of these middle class workers will not have transferable skills to other like paying jobs. From the NY Times article:<br />
<blockquote>For all its benefits, the newfound power of real estate has also left the country vulnerable to a housing slowdown, which many economists expect over the next few years. Residential housing now makes up 16 percent, or $1.9 trillion, of the gross domestic product and is the economy&#8217;s largest single sector, slightly bigger than the industries and services that supply health care, according to Economy.com.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Since the real estate sector has been the main source of job creation for the economy for several years, I&#8217;m concerned that the coming RE slowdown will create a large pool of displaced workers that will have to take a substantial cut in pay.  Therfore the housing slowdown might have a larger impact on the economy than many economists expect.  Of course that doesn&#8217;t count the hotel <a href="http://www.naplesnews.com/npdn/news/article/0,2071,NPDN_14940_3916350,00.html">doormen</a> moonlighting as flippers &#8230;<br />
<blockquote>Joey Rock, a 26-year-old real estate investor who also is a doorman at the Ritz-Carlton, &#8230; says he&#8217;s flipped a half-dozen properties. On a North Naples townhouse at Stratford Place, a hot Pulte Homes community near Interstate 75 that&#8217;s now sold out, Rock made a cool $84,600 in 15 days. </p>
<p>&#8220;Easy money,&#8221; says Rock, who later had to ask a reporter to show him which particular unit it was that he sold. He&#8217;d never seen it. </p>
<p>Property records show Rock bought the townhouse at 960 Hampton Circle preconstruction, closed on it on Feb. 18 for $185,400 and sold it on March 4 for $270,000. </p></blockquote>
