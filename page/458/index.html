                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Robert Waldmann<br /><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/03/i-think-paul-krugman-is-wrong.html"><br />Defenders</a> of the Geithner plan <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/03/road-nationalization">argue</a> that, even if Obama knows he will eventually have to nationalize banks, <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/03/the_geithner_plan_and_congress.php">he has to show</a> he is willing to try everything, absolutely everything, else first, so that he can convince Congress that he really has to nationalize banks.</p>
<p>So the idea is to buy a few votes in the Senate (A Republican and who knows how many Blue Dogs) for a mere $ 500,000,000,000 OK less, since not all of the money will be lost. With luck only $ 100,000,000,000 or maybe ten to twenty billion a vote.</p>
<p>I think you could buy them cheaper with a public private plan with lower subsidies (I mean if the plan is to fail one might as well fail cheaply) but I&#8217;ve never bought a Senator.</p>
<p>In any case, DeLong et al seem to understand what is going on.  Today&#8217;s Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/23/AR2009032302830.html?hpid=topnews">tells me</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The Obama administration is considering asking Congress to give the Treasury secretary unprecedented powers to initiate the seizure of non-bank financial companies, such as large insurers, investment firms and hedge funds, whose collapse would damage the broader economy, according to an administration document. </p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds a bit like Bush and Iraq frankly.  Asking for the authority while saying they don&#8217;t want to use it, and going through the motions of trying something else.  I didn&#8217;t like Colin Powell&#8217;s speech at the security council, but now I notice its strong point &#8212; it didn&#8217;t cost a hundred billion dollars.</p>
<p>Oh well you go to nationalization with the Senate you have not the Senate you want.</p>
<p>update:  Paul Krugman <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/larry-larry/">writes</a></p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a bit disappointing to see the Obama administration engaging in this sort of market-worship — hailing markets as a Good Thing in themselves, rather than as an often but not always useful means to an end. But I have reason to think that unlike the Bushies, they don’t really believe it; it’s just politics. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now the double super secret deepest background conversation with a source who is so anonymous that Krugman provides no hint as to whether his source is human or devine which is his &#8220;reason to think&#8221; might have been insincere.  Policy makers have been known to secretly tell different people who believe contradictory things that, yes I can tell you in secret I agree with you, but if you quote me I will deny it.</p>
<p>However, Paul Krugman has a long memory and smart people are reluctant to jerk his leg.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say my despair is now 60% lifted.</p>

<blockquote><p>Wall Street and the Economy</p>
<p>Suppose Timothy Geithner announced a new program that would tax every family $10,000 dollars and give the money to Wall Street banks and hedge funds. (Any resemblance between this hypothetical program and real world programs is purely coincidental.) </p>
<p>We would expect the stock of Wall Street banks and other financial sector firms to rally based on the anticipation of higher profits. Is this good for the economy? It&#8217;s not in any obvious way. After all, we can always tax people more to raise profits for Wall Street, but that doesn&#8217;t help the economy.</p>
<p>Reporters should remember this when assessing Wall Street&#8217;s response to the plan proposed by Geithner for buying bad assets from banks. The larger the subsidy, the better the news for Wall Street. It&#8217;s not clear that most of the public should be happy about seeing more of their tax dollars going to Wall Street.</p>

<p>A lot of the blogolandian debate on the Geithner plan is based on the assumption that there are only three options<br />1) The Geithner plan<br />2) Try to convince congress to nationalize banks now (real quick before they knew what hit them) <br />and<br />3) Do nothing.</p>
<p>Now this is reasonable in the sense that no way in hell is a blogger going to manage to get any 4th option to be seriously considered.</p>
<p>On the other hand, that also means there is no harm in arguing for a fourth way<br />as I do after the jump.</p>
<p>Before you get bored I have a plan</p>
<p>1. Private partners put up 1% of the money and get a 1% share of a public private partnership.  They also get paid a fee.  They have incentives to maximize the present discounted stream of revenue, discouted at a rate which corresponds to their modest risk.</p>
<p>Simple, does not create incentives to overpay and alligns public and private interests except 1% of a trillion is a good chunk of change and not totally unscary and 1% of up and down sides are not enough to keep private partners from effectively taking bribes. </p>
<p>I think this is the least bad proposal</p>
<p>The cases for and against nationalization are overwhelming &#8212; the irresistable force meets the immovable object.</p>
<p>For) It is the only approach that has ever worked in situations like this.</p>
<p>Against) It would cost a ton, includes the word nationalization and needs the support of 60 senators.  Oh and there would be monstrously bad incentives during any long and drawn out debate about nationalization.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that the immovable object called the US senate wins this one.</p>
<p>In any case, the Obama administration has to convince people that they tried everything else and it didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>The problem with the Geithner plan is that it involves a large transfer from the public purse to the current owners of toxic sludge.  This is unfair and unjust and also will stave off collapse for a while, reducing pressure to really deal with the problem rather than increasing it.</p>
<p>The transfers are due to the <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/23/geithner-plan-arithmetic/">non recourse loan Geithner put aspect.</a> which can, and probably will, drive prices up so high that the US debt will be enlarged by the plan &#8212; that is prices will be above hold to maturity value when treasury interest rates are used to discount cash flows.</p>
<p>The claim is the plan addresses the problems that all private agents are short of cash right now *and* that perceived risks are high so the US government which can borrow at low rates and has no reason to be risk averse (rather the opposite it should go deeper in debt when things go badly) has to be involved.</p>
<p>Now except for the &#8220;all&#8221; this makes sense (the &#8220;all&#8221; is needed to explain the extremely low trading volume that is the market freeze up).  I will assume that the argument is true.</p>
<p>That does not imply that the solution is the Geithner plan.  The Geithner plan pushes up prices by an amount (which depends on the variance of returns on the assets) which was arbitrarily decided.  It does not just provide extra cash (the 99% share in my proposal) or reduce the risk that private managers have to bear (the Treasury bears 99% of it under my proposal).  I don&#8217;t think it is designed to address the problems used to justify it.  I think it is designed to address those problems and transfer public money to banks.</p>

                                <p>Following up on <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/delong-krugman-and-risk-aversion.html">Robert&#8217;s post</a> (he started later and finished earlier):</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2009/03/risk.html">Dr. Black</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[T]he idea that all this came about simply because the banksters decided a bit of extra risk was good is an idea only a macro finance person could sanely entertain.</p></blockquote>
<p>All right, I represent that remark in more ways than one. So let&#8217;s Tell the Truth, Shame the Devil, and make the case for Financial Intermediation—all while agreeing with him that Geithner&#8217;s statement is absurd.</p>
<p>(For my next trick, I&#8217;ll spin plates on poles and juggle cutlery while riding a unicycle. You might want to stay clear of the area for a while)</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s talk about weather derivatives, the driving habits of government employees, and Miss Spider&#8217;s Sunny Patch below the break.</p>
<p>It was 1993, I think, when Richard Sandor gave the closing presentation at the ISDA Conference in Washington, D.C.  Sandor was enthusiastic; there was finally enough weather trend data that you could model damage expectations for an area and reasonably estimate, for instance, the likely exposure of an insurance company to hurricane or tornado damage.</p>
<p>We may not be able to do anything about the weather, but we <em>can</em> do something about managing the risk associated with it.</p>
<p>Sandor&#8217;s argument was, in short, That&#8217;s what we do.  We manage risk.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the story of GEICO, the current crown jewel of Berkshire Hathaway.  GEICO started as an insurance company dedicated to Government Employees.  It started that way for a reason, and the reason has everything to do with risk.  Because GEICO management looked at the data and realised what anyone who thinks about it for a second will already know: government employees are safer drivers than the rest of the population.</p>
<p>They are safer drivers because <em>they are more risk-averse</em>.  They take a job with, as a rule, lower pay than they could get in the public market, but better security. They prefer stability.  Short version: they are risk averse.</p>
<p>Therefore, they are safer drivers than the general populace (who don&#8217;t want to be stuck behind them when they are time-dependent).</p>
<p>SO when <a target="_blank" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/03/i-think-paul-krugman-is-wrong.html">Brad DeLong says</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I think the private-sector players in financial markets right now are highly risk averse&#8211;hence assets are undervalued from the perspective of a society or a government that is less risk averse.</p></blockquote>
<p>my immediate response is at best Inigo Montoya (&#8220;I do not think those words mean what you think they do&#8221;) and at worst a version of Nelson Algren&#8217;s amendment of Thackeray (&#8220;That&#8217;s Not the Way to Bet&#8221;).</p>
<p>Because risk management means managing risk, not just taking chances.  <a target="_blank" href="http://itmightbedangerous.blogspot.com/2008/06/draft-review-about-process.html">Hitting on 17 in blackjack</a> isn&#8217;t the way to get rich.  Paying $50 for something that is worth $35 to you isn&#8217;t the way of getting rich.</p>
<p>And, worse, it isn&#8217;t the way to get capitalism working again.</p>
<p>Because sooner or later, the professionals have to take over again.</p>
<p>The kids were watching <em>Miss Spider&#8217;s Sunny Patch</em> this weekend, an episode where the young Dragonfly flies for the first time, accompanying a bunch of &#8220;Daredevil&#8221; dragonflies.  They fly for a while and then the whole place gets covered in fog.  The daredevils find a place to sit and wait.  The youngster keeps chiding them: &#8220;C&#8217;mon, I thought you guys were Daredevils.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Daredevils explain, roughly, that they don&#8217;t fly without knowing where they are going.</p>
<p>Unlike, apparently, the U.S. Treasury.</p>
<p>Robert already dealt with the basic illiquidity of the market.  So let&#8217;s talk about Price Discovery, but this is getting long even for me, so&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>I think the private-sector players in financial markets right now are highly risk averse&#8211;hence assets are undervalued from the perspective of a society or a government that is less risk averse. Paul judges that assets have low values beceuse they are unlikely to pay out much cash.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have the same objection to this that I have to Brad&#8217;s analysis in general.  He is explaining the market price but not explaining trading volume.</p>
<p>Trading volume in MBS based CDOs is very very low (markets have &#8220;frozen&#8221;).  It is very difficult for this to happen at a price below the expected value of cash flows discounted at the safe rate of interest.  For the private sector to hold all of the assets, it is necessary for the expected return to be high, maybe very high if the variance in returns is  high.</p>
<p>However, for this to drive trading volume to essentially zero, it is necessary that no private sector entity wants to buy a little more of the asset at its current price.  That means that the covariance of the return on the asset and the returns on every existing portfolio must be positive &#8212; otherwise a little bit more of the asset is a hedge and someone will buy a little bit more even at a return lower than the safe rate.</p>
<p>There are a lot of naked CDSs out there.  They were cheap when bought, but are now expensive and, therefore, risky &#8212; if the economy makes it out of the crisis they will lose their value.  If I owned a naked CDS on Mortgage based CDOs I would like to clothe it right now.  I would certainly clothe it, that is buy the CDO, if the expected return on the CDO was above the safe interest rate.</p>
<p>If I owned as much of both CDS and CDO  (a fully clothed or Burka portfolio) I would still be bearing counterparty risk on the CDO but just a bit of CDO (a G-string or not quite totally naked portfolio) would be nice.<br /><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/03/moneyblogging-vs-sexblogging.html"><br />Why are the people with naked CDSs buying G-strings ?</a></p>

<p>Shorter US Treasury</p>
<p><a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/tg65.htm">&#8220;I usually shop there, but they are having a fire sale so we should go shop somewhere else&#8221;</a></p>
<p>When did they hire Yogi &#8220;no one goes there anymore, its too crowded&#8221; Berra ?</p>
<p>Direct quote of the US Treasury </p>
<p>&#8220;a wide-scale deleveraging in these markets and led to fire sales. As prices declined, many traditional investors exited these markets, causing declines in market liquidity.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not a joke.  The key to the Treasury argument is that asset prices are far far below hold to maturity values and that no one wants to buy them &#8212; that is, that no one shops during fire sales.</p>
<p>Also, others have noticed this but The Treasury officially rejects anathematizes and abjures the socialist doctrine of &#8220;supply and demand&#8221; enunciated by Marx&#8217;s great teacher Adam Smith.</p>
<p>They write &#8220;Third, to reduce the likelihood that the government will overpay for these assets, private sector investors competing with one another will establish the price of the loans and securities purchased under the program.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is competition among buyers drives down prices.</p>
<p>On the other hand, looks like we saved half a trillion since &#8220;he Public-Private Investment Program will generate $500 billion in purchasing power to buy legacy assets – with the potential to expand to $1 trillion over time.&#8221; so that&#8217;s something.  Also the FED will take part of the hit which is nice since the FDIC is desparately needed, underfunded and has to ask Congress for money instead of just printing it.</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.occ.treas.gov/aboutocc.htm">OCC</a> is: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency   <br />
<blockquote>The OCC was established in 1863 as a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The OCC is headed by the Comptroller , who is appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a five-year term. The Comptroller also serves as a director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and a director of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. </p>
<p>The OCC&#8217;s activities are predicated on four objectives that support the OCC&#8217;s mission to ensure a stable and competitive national banking system. The four objectives are: </p>
<p>To ensure the safety and soundness of the national banking system. <br />To foster competition by allowing banks to offer new products and services. <br />To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of OCC supervision, including reducing regulatory burden. <br />To ensure fair and equal access to financial services for all Americans. </p></blockquote>
<p>Out of the 4 statements and I count 9 items, I think they only have achieved two items: <br />&#8230;allowing banks to offer new products and services<br />&#8230;including reducing regulatory burden.</p>
<p>Funding?<br />
<blockquote>The OCC does not receive any appropriations from Congress. Instead, its operations are funded primarily by assessments on national banks. National banks pay for their examinations, and they pay for the OCC&#8217;s processing of their corporate applications. The OCC also receives revenue from its investment income, primarily from U.S. Treasury securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ring a bell?<br />If yes, you are probably thinking about the one that got <a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2005/occ_spitzer2.html">Elliot Spitzer</a> and the other 48 AG&#8217;s pissed off.  That one certainly needs to be reversed.  Infact, the AG is going before the Supremes on the 25th. <a href="http://www.consumersunion.org/pub/core_financial_services/009349.html">There is a push</a> to get Obama et al to change this ruling. <br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON, D.C. – <br />For the past four years, the OCC has been championing deregulatory and minimal standards against states that have been trying to enact higher standards for banks and their operating subsidiaries. When states tried to monitor mortgage lending and protect consumers, the OCC invited national banks to contact the agency, which then wrote letters to banks and state banking agencies asserting that states had no authority to do so. The OCC also sided with national banks in the courts, writing amicus briefs arguing that state monitoring and enforcement in a variety of areas did not apply, and that only the OCC could investigate and enforce laws against nationally chartered banks. <br />After the Second Circuit Court sided with the OCC, the Attorneys General of all 50 states urged the Supreme Court to take up the case and reverse the appeals court decision. The Supreme Court agreed and, on March 25, the U.S. must file its brief in the case on behalf of the OCC, an agency under the Treasury Department.</p></blockquote>
<p>With all the talk about re-regulating why have we not heard boo from Obama et al about changing this.  I mean, he changed with a simple pen other bad positions from the last administration that are not related at all to the #1 issue of world wide economic collapse.  What could be more simple and basic to steps to be taken to resolving this crisis than undoing the OCC ruling?  Why is Obama leaving this OCC issue to chance when the Supremes already ruled in favor of Wachovia against Michigan? <br />
<blockquote>This included the case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court last year against Michigan, in which the OCC sided with Wachovia Bank and argued that state mortgage lending laws and oversight could not apply to a national bank’s operating subsidiary.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just read this <a href="http://www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices-government/10575155-1.html">article from 2005</a> about the issue to see what the pro-OCC crowd was thinking.  </p>
<p>Ok, it wasn&#8217;t that ruling you were thinking of.  Maybe you were thinking about the OCC ruling letting banks be realtors and real estate developers?  I would understand, it was a 2006 ruling making it a little more fresh in the mind.  Needless to say, the <a href="http://www.realtor.org/banks_and_commerce.nsf/docfiles/T-06Sept-shelton.pdf/%24FILE/T-06Sept-shelton.pdf">National Association of Realtors</a> was not happy.<br />
<blockquote>The OCC decisions permit U.S. national banks to engage in the business of real estate development by developing and operating a luxury hotel; financing, developing, operating and leasing space in a mixed use building (including developing residential condominiums for sale). They need only argue that a small portion of the project is needed for bank premises or that a part of the project is needed to make the rest economically feasible. <strong>They may also hold a 70 percent equity stake in a windmill business, qualifying for special tax credits.</strong> Three national banks were given the green light to engage in these business activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well there goes the green powered economy Obama wants.</p>
<p>But there was another ruling from the OCC that I&#8217;m thinking of.  A ruling that requires Obama to undo a Clinton era position from 1996.  And, funny thing it had an entire industry all bent out of shape that today would not be recognized as completely and entirely distinct from the banks; <a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18894030.html">the insurance industry</a>.<br />
<blockquote>Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; bank subsidiaries may sell insurance<br />WASHINGTON &#8212; Insurance groups are vowing to do everything possible to block a new ruling by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that could allow national banks to form operating subsidiaries that sell and underwrite insurance. </p>
<p>Gary Hughes, vice president and chief counsel with the Washington-based American Council of Life Insurance, said his preliminary analysis suggests two possible levels of attack. </p>
<p>First, Mr. Hughes said, insurers could charge that Comptroller Eugene Ludwig does not have the power to adopt the ruling. Second, he said, insurers could say that even if the ruling is lawful, insurance underwriting is not incidental to banking and thus &#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>Are you seeing a pattern here?  No?  How about this <a href="http://www.dmnews.com/OCC-Ruling-Relieves-Credit-Card-Marketers/article/78737/">2002 ruling:</a><br />
<blockquote>A recent ruling by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency eased fears of marketers in the credit card industry about any possible new rules that could have hampered telemarketing of debt suspension and cancellation agreements.<br />In addition, the OCC declined to consider the agreements a type of insurance product. Doing so would have taken the agreements out of the hands of federal regulators and into the jurisdiction of the states, opening the possibility that they would be subject to 50 different state laws.</p>
<p>The OCC also ruled that marketers could provide consumers with short-form disclosures at the time of closing an agreement provided that they mail a long-form disclosure brochure afterward. The new rules take effect in June 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>How did the OCC get to do this?  Guess!<br />
<blockquote>Congress granted the OCC the authority to regulate credit card marketers when it passed the <strong>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999</strong>. In 2000, the office published a notice of proposed rulemaking stating that it was considering changes regarding debt suspension and cancellation agreements.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know we are all thinking the bad guys have been the prior Treasury, Fed and AG.  But I gotta tell you, looking at these OCC actions, the OCC seems to be the real Ace under the table and <strong>NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THEM</strong>!  Hell, they get their money from fees charged to the industry they regulate.  And recently we heard that a part of their directorship duties, the FDIC, hasn&#8217;t been collecting the insurance premiums.   Though that was <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/03/11/now_needy_fdic_collected_little_in_premiums/">do to congress </a>I guess. I mean, no influence from the industry here (cough, cough, choking, choking).</p>
<p>I just can&#8217;t resist closing with this statement about why the fees were not collected.  They (as in congress, bankers, financiers) really believed in the free lunch money from money theories.<br />
<blockquote>But James Chessen, chief economist of the American Bankers Association, said that it made sense at the time to stop collecting most premiums because &#8220;the fund became so large that interest income on the fund was covering the premiums for almost a decade.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, just like your 401K huh?</p>

<p>The posing and posturing hopefully will produce a partially reasonable plan for the overall benefit of US citizens.  There will always be winners and losers, but let us hope the re-distribution of wealth does not continue to be mostly up the ladder.</p>
<p>Update:  Dean Baker has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.truthout.org/032309J">take on this</a> notion.</p>

                                <p>UPDATE:  Dr. Black <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2009/03/uh-brad.html">twists the knife</a>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/03/the-geithner-plan-faq.html">The Geithner Plan FAQ</a> is worth reading; it&#8217;s a classic example of treating an incomplete market as if it were the entire market.  And note that &#8220;skin in the game&#8221; is limited to a part of the local pool.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while Treasury plays in the wading pool, hedge funds have The Whole Wide World in which to romp. <a target="_blank" href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2009/03/despair-over-financial-policy.html">Yves</a> (h/t <a target="_blank" href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2009/03/despair-over-financial-policy.html">Mark Thoma</a>) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2009/03/investor-on-private-public-partnership.html">has a commenter who explains</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Say I am SAC Capital. I get to be one of the bidders on bank assets covered by the program</p>
<p>Citi holds $100mm of face-value securities, carried at $80mm.</p>
<p>The market bid on these securities is $30mm. Say with perfect foresight the value of all cash flows is $50mm.</p>
<p>I bid Citi $75mm. I put up $2.25mm or 3%, Treasury funds the rest.</p>
<p>I then buy $10mm in CDS directly from Citi [or another participant (BOA, GS, etc)] on the bonds for a premium of $1mm.</p>
<p>In the fullness of time, we get the final outcome, the bonds are worth $50mm</p>
<p>SAC loses $2.25mm of principal, but gets $9mm net in CDS proceeds, so recovers $6.75mm on a $2.25mm investment. Profit is $4.5mm</p>
<p>Citi writes down $5mm from the initial sale of the securities, and a $9mm CDS loss. Total loss, $14mm (against a potential $30mm loss without the program)</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury loses $22.75mm.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would have thought by now that economists would know what happens when you create bubbles in a market.  That doesn&#8217;t change just because you use the U.S. Treasury as a Fluffer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSN1629460520090316">&#8220;the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets U.S. accounting rules, proposed to give more leeway on mark-to-market accounting rules. &#8220;</a></p>
<p>In my (ignorant) view, this is an act of desperation allowing banks to make up asset values, because given current market prices they would be insolvent.</p>
<p>The argument is that current prices are below fundamental value because of a panic, or forced deleveraging (due to mark to market rules) or adverse selection.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe any of this.  However, I note that, if this is the problem, there is a less extreme solution.  </p>
<p>Bank A can buy 10% of Bank B&#8217;s holdings of toxic sludge for X% of face value which equals Y dollars and, in exchange, bank B buys Z % of Bank A&#8217;s holdings for W% of face value which equals Y dollars.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure each bank will claim (and think) the other is getter a better deal (the average banker is sure he is above average).  However, if market prices are grossly under fundamental value *and* marking to market is forcing banks to unwind anyway, then both will benefit.</p>
<p>Now I ignorantly guess (and certainly hope) that existing mark to market rules require arms length transactions.  Still if we need to bend the rules I would bend them this way &#8212; allowing specific non arms length transactions.</p>
<p>If banks were allowed to do this, but would refuse to do this and insist on marking to model, it means there is no half way objective rough estimate of hold to maturity value and the marking to model is fraud.</p>
<p>update: After a long struggle with my sense of propriety (I won my sense of propriety lost) I note that my original running title was </p>
<p>&#8220;The Ball Kickers Approach To Balance Sheets&#8221;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there is not a punctuation error in that phrase, Kickers is a plural and not a possessive.  The ball kickers are soccer players.  The traditional means by which insolvent Italian Soccer teams cook their books is to each buy the contract of a player from the other team &#8212; and grossly overpay.  The gross overpayment counts as a capital gain to each.  Each purchased contract is marked to the pseudo-market they just made.</p>
<p>You know living in Italy (and occasionally reading the sports pages) I think I&#8217;ve picked up some business skills that are in very high demand these days back in the USA.  Italian cooking is an art, including book cooking.</p>
