                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The November employment figures were <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">released by the BLS</a> this morning.  It shows surprisingly weak growth in the labor market:</p>
<blockquote><p>Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 112,000 in November to 132.1 million, seasonally adjusted.  This followed a much larger increase of 303,000 in October.  In November, employment rose in health care and social assistance, leisure and hospitality, and other service-providing industries.</p></blockquote>
<p>At this point one might recall the Bush administration&#8217;s expectation about the number of jobs in the US in 2004: in the <em>Economic Report of the President</em> the White House predicted average employment this year of 132.7 million.  Since employment started the year at 130.2 million, this implies that they were predicting December employment of over 135 million.  We&#8217;re 3 million jobs short.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>The average workweek for production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.1 hour in November to 33.7 hours, seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p>&#8230;Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls were up by 1 cent in November to $15.83, seasonally adjusted, following a 4-cent gain in October.  Average weekly earnings decreased by 0.2 percent over the month to $533.47. Over the year, average hourly earnings increased by 2.4 percent, and average weekly earnings grew by 2.1 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only were fewer jobs created than expected (expectations had been in the neighborhood of 200,000 jobs), but hours of work were down slightly and pay was essentially flat.</p>
<p>Note that the 2.1% gain in average weekly earnings so far in 2004 compares poorly to the 3.2% increase in consumer prices in 2004 through October; by this measure, average real pay has gone down this year.  Note as well that nonfarm business labor productivity increased by 3.1% in the year through September 2004.  So it continues to be the case that as workers become more productive, their hourly pay fails to fully reflect that improvement &#8212; another symptom of this seemingly chronically weak labor market.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Reader Steve writes in with a good question about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/12/three-card-monte.html">Greenspan&#8217;s 3-Card Monte:</a><br />
<br />
<blockquote>Love your site and have been following the various articles about Social Security. Admittedly, my understanding of the system is very raw as is probably the case with most people who are not economists. My question is therefore very basic. How does the Trust Fund &#8220;bail out&#8221; the General Fund? If the Trust Fund holds General Fund bonds, won&#8217;t the General Fund have to eventually pay the Trust Fund?</p></blockquote>
<p>My response:</p>
<p>The trust fund bails out the general fund in the following sense (the numbers are made up, but the point will hopefully be clear):</p>
<p>1. The government spends $1.4 trillion on everything but social security.<br />
<br />2. The government collects $600 billion in non-social security taxes.<br />
<br />3. So the deficit is $800 billion, seemingly.<br />
<br />4. Now suppose that social security collects $800b in payroll taxes while spending only $600b in payments to retirees. So Social Security has a $200b surplus which it uses to buy bonds from the U.S. Treasury (had Gore won in 2000, said bonds would, apparently, have been put in a <a href="http://www.antimatternews.com/2004/05/bush_keeps_gore.html">lockbox of some sort</a>).</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s how the deficit you typically hear about is computed:<br />

<ul>
<li>Total money in is $600b (income taxes) + $800b (payroll taxes) = $1.4 trillion</li>
<li>Total money out is $1.4 trillion + $600b = $2 trillion.</li>
<li>Deficit = $600b (Not $800b!)</li>
</ul>
<p> So while the operating deficit is $800b (see 3, above), the total deficit after counting Social Security&#8217;s surplus is only $600b. Thus, the trust fund has &#8220;bailed out&#8221; the general fund and in the process mitigated some of the outrage and political problems that accompany large deficits. In principle, the general fund will eventually have to repay the trust fund, but that&#8217;s a long time away. And, if we instead privatize social security or otherwise cancel the program, then that time may never come.</p>
<p>The result of this has been that for the last twenty-plus years payroll taxes have been higher and income taxes have been lower. Of course, payroll taxes are regressive while income taxes are progressive, so this has been a big transfer of wealth from the lower and middle classes to the upper class. That transfer was premised on the idea that, someday, the social security system would stop running surpluses and start running deficits. And those deficits would be made up by cashing in the accumulated Treasury Bonds, which would be paid off by raising income taxes, thereby reversing the transfer.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already had, and still have, the upwards wealth transfer part. Whether the implicit promise will be honored remains to be seen.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Many of us (see for example <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004-2_archives/000592.html">Brad DeLong</a>) have been wondering for some time why the bond market does not seem to be reflecting expectations of a dollar depreciation into its prices.  Shouldn&#8217;t investors be demanding higher interest rates to compensate them for the exchange rate risk that they&#8217;re taking on by holding dollars?  Yet bond yields have stayed surprisingly low.</p>
<p>One possible explanation is that the signals that the bond market is sending have been somewhat distorted this year (i.e. not reflective of average market sentiment) because of the large-scale participation of foreign central banks in the bond market.  The chart below shows the 6-month moving average of net purchases of US treasuries by foreign central banks and governments.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/tic_data1.jpg"></p>
<p>It&#8217;s plausible to imagine that the $15 or $20 bn in net monthly demand for bonds this year by foreign official institutions could be affecting prices.  Since central banks (and other government actors) often pursue different objectives from the typical private investor, bond prices may therefore not really have been reflecting market expectations.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s some evidence that foreign central banks are curbing their appetite for US government bonds.  If this is the start of trend, then bond prices may increasingly reflect market expectations.  </p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks long-term bond yields have risen by a quarter of a percentage point.  But more interesting is what has happened to the inflation expectations that the bond market reflects.  In the last two months the bond market has revised upward its inflation expectations for the coming five years considerably&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/infl_expectations.jpg"></p>
<p>Is the bond market simply predicting higher future growth, and thus inflationary pressures, over the next five years?  Or is this the first sign that some bond market players are pricing in a future dollar depreciation?  (Note that a dollar depreciation will cause a jump in US inflation as imports become more expensive.)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the answer, though the latter seems more likely to me than the former.  But I do know one thing: keep your eyes on the bond market.</p>
<p>Kash</p>
<p>UPDATE: The inflation expectations presented in the chart above reflect the difference between the 5 year Treasury note and the 5 year TIPS.  My apologies for not making that clear.</p>

<p>*************<br />
<br />Following up on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004_02_29_angrybear_archive.html#107824838689419474">Kash&#8217;s earlier post</a> about Greenspan, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/02/opinion/02KRUG.html?ex=1393563600&#038;en=f70ca455a31dd83d&amp;ei=5007&#038;partner=USERLAND">Krugman&#8217;s op/ed</a> also highlights a fairly bold bait and switch maneuver by Greenspan:<br />
<blockquote>The payroll tax is regressive: it falls much more heavily on middle- and lower-income families than it does on the rich. In fact, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, families near the middle of the income distribution pay almost twice as much in payroll taxes as in income taxes. Yet people were willing to accept a regressive tax increase to sustain Social Security.</p>
<p>Now the joke&#8217;s on them. Mr. Greenspan pushed through an increase in taxes on working Americans, generating a Social Security surplus. Then he used that surplus to argue for tax cuts that deliver very little relief to most people, but are worth a lot to those making more than $300,000 a year. And now that those tax cuts have contributed to a soaring deficit, he wants to cut Social Security benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>As you can see from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004_02_22_angrybear_archive.html#107751944016281105">this post</a> last week, the 2004 deficit is only brought down to a mere $500,000,000,000 by starting with the non-trustfund deficit of $631,000,000,000 and subtracting from that the $154,000,000,000 surplus created by the payroll tax (money allegedly going into the trust fund/lockbox).</p>
<p>To summarize, here&#8217;s Greenspan&#8217;s 20+ year plan to roll back Social Security:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Step 1. Get appointed in early 1980s to committee to protect Social Security.<br />
</p>
<p>Step 2. Successfully propose substantial increases in regressive payroll taxes in order to save Social Security. Workers will pay higher payroll taxes but their retirement benefits will be assured.<br />
</p>
<p>Step 3. Wait 20 years; to pass the time, become Chairman of the Federal Reserve.<br />
</p>
<p>Step 4. Actively support large and regressive cuts in <em>income</em> taxes. Never mention <em>payroll</em> taxes.<br />
</p>
<p>Step 5. Repeat step 4.<br />
</p>
<p>Step 6. Observe that in 2004, steps 4 and 5 lead to a $631b shortfall; Step 2, however, created a $154b surplus.<br />
</p>
<p>Step 7. Reverse Steps 4 and 5.<br />
</p>
<p>Step 8. Just kidding about step 7. Seriously, the answer is clear: cut Social Security benefits.</p>

                                <p>The Bull Moose says it is sponsored by the Democratic Leadership Council and judging from <a href="http://www.bullmooseblog.com/2004/11/third-rail.html">this piece</a> on the politics of the Social Security debate, I hope Congressional Democrats pay attention to their blog.  As far as the economics, the Moose points to this wisdom from E. J. Dionne:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;if Social Security privatization is supposed to be about making &#8220;younger workers&#8221; better off, as Bush has said, will he please explain why piling yet more debt on their backs should make them grateful?</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Kevin Drum has two posts of interest.  The <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_12/005236.php">first</a> is a longer version of an excellent comment made by Bakho to my last post on this issue as it notes the payroll tax increase of 1983, which was supposed to be for prefunding our Social Security retirement fund but now looks like it was nothing more than an employment tax increase to fund tax cuts on capital income.  Thanks both to Bakho and to Kevin for keeping this distributional issue alive.</p>
<p>Kevin’s <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_12/005237.php">second post</a> points to <a href="http://tennessean.com/government/archives/04/11/62186658.shtml?Element_ID=62186658">this article</a> about how Senator Frist managed his campaign finances.  Kevin does not try to relate this story to the Social Security debate, but let me try.  The article and Kevin note that Frist put his finances into the stock market – I guess hoping to receive higher returns than one would get from placing the funds into Treasury bills.  While the expected return to stocks might exceed the return to government bonds, actual returns may deviate from expected returns and sometimes negatively.  OK, some Democrats overplay the risk aspect of putting Social Security funds into the stock market but what I find interesting about this story is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>After big losses in the stock market, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist&#8217;s campaign committee is short of money to cover a bank loan that was due in August, records show. The committee&#8217;s most recent filing shows a little more than $10,000 was paid on the $360,000 loan from U.S. Bank.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the Frist campaign used borrowed funds to invest in the stock market and now U.S. Bank is facing default risk.  Since it is the leadership of the GOP that wants to borrow on our Social Security Trust Fund to cover the massive General Fund deficits, it would seem how he manages his campaign financing to be an interesting analogy.<br /></p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>New personal income and spending figures for October were released this morning.  <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/newsrel/pinewsrelease.htm">The BEA reports</a> a headline figure of a 0.6% increase in income and a 0.7% increase in spending, both of which are quite high.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are a couple of problems with the report, too.  Much of the increase in income and spending was eaten up by higher prices, so real changes in income and spending were just 0.2% and 0.3% respectively.  Also, only about half of the increase in personal income was in the form of employee compensation; the rest was income to businesses and property-owners.  Such income gains are no less real than increases in employee compensation, but this pattern does suggest that we are still not seeing as much of a broad-based increase in income as might be expected at this phase in the recovery.</p>
<p>But the most striking thing about the report to me is the continued evaporation of saving by Americans.  The personal saving rate fell to just 0.2% of after-tax income in October.  That means that an average family that earns $75,000 per year, with take-home pay of about $5,000 per month, is saving about <strong>$10 per month</strong>.  That&#8217;s it.  </p>
<p>The chart below shows the trend in savings in the US over the past few years.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/savings1.jpg"></p>
<p>This low savings rate is one of the two primary contributors to the US&#8217;s massive current account deficit (the federal budget deficit is the other culprit).  In order to shrink the US&#8217;s current account deficit, one of two things must happen: business spending must fall, or this savings rate must rise, and rise significantly.  (Yes, I&#8217;m assuming that the federal deficit won&#8217;t fall any time soon.)</p>
<p>So my question is this: can we realistically imagine the household savings rate rising substantially on its own, i.e. without any major shocks to household finances?  A gradual, independent rise in household saving would help to bring about a smooth end to some of the worst of the US&#8217;s current financial imbalances.  Such a transition is probably what Alan Greenspan has had in mind when he has talked about a smooth and natural resolution to the US&#8217;s current account deficit.</p>
<p>But personally, I&#8217;m skeptical of such a scenario.  Low savings rates during the late 1990s and into 2000 were justified, it was argued, because of the rising value of household stock portfolios.  Low savings has been justified (at least according to the non-savers) so far in this decade because of rising home values.  But if those are really the reasons for low savings rates, then such logic indicates that savings won&#8217;t recover until the asset price bubbles start to unwind.  In other words, household finances will have to be pinched in a painful way before Americans are prompted to save more and spend less.  </p>
<p>Such a painful pinching is exactly what a currency and financial crisis in the US would precipitate.  And unfortunately, that is exactly why it seems increasingly likely to me that it will take such a crisis to resolve the US&#8217;s financial imbalances.</p>

                                <p>The very good discussion of the Social Security issue between <a href="http://%20voxbaby.blogspot.com/2004/11/social-security-in-new-york-times.html">Andrew Samwick</a> and <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/000963.html">Max Sawicky </a> has been extended as Andrew and Max point to <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2004/11/weighing_in_on_.html">this contribution</a> from David Altig.</p>
<p>David’s blog will become a must read for me – and his point is simply that the timing of spending versus tax receipts is less important for the solvency of a fund than their present values if long-run solvency is the concern.  If the Social Security Trust Fund will not be asked to bail out the General Fund, then its shortfall = 1% of GDP over the long-run could be readily be addressed by modest cuts in benefits.  The problem, however, is that the Bush Republicans have neither the will to raise income taxes nor plans to reduce Federal spending in any other meaningful ways.  And since the General Fund shortfall = 3% of GDP, a massive reduction in Social Security benefits would be needed if the Trust Fund is to bail out the General Fund.  Solvency issues aside, the Bush Republicans are paying for income tax cuts with increases in employment taxes.  In other words, the big issue is the implied redistribution of the tax burden from owners of capital to workers.<br /></p>

                                <p>This Reuters <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/11/27/news/economy/bush_socsec.reut/index.htm">story</a> tries to give one of those “fair and balanced” discussions but one word tips us off just a wee bit.  The story includes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Facing record budget deficits, the Bush administration likely will turn to short-term government borrowing to help finance its plan to add personal retirement accounts to Social Security, officials said Saturday… One analysis this year by the White House Council of Economic Advisers found that tapping the bond markets to pay for private accounts would increase the nation&#8217;s debt-to-GDP ratio by 23.6 percentage points by 2036. Under this scenario, the debt held by the public would increase by as much as $4.7 trillion. </p></blockquote>
<p>But then those of us who pay more attention to the total Federal debt might note that the debt held by the public is not the right yardstick assuming the “lock box” is honored.  So “fair and balanced” might be in order but this seems to go too far:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the nation&#8217;s debt load would increase initially, it would fall as the reforms are phased in, advocates say…But the new government bonds would be repaid 20 years later, eliminating Social Security&#8217;s unfunded liability while reducing the tax burden in the long term, advocates said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Excuse me for asking but how is reshuffling the chairs on the Titanic going to eliminate the massive Federal insolvency?  It seems these “advocates” failed to tell Reuters how, but at least Reuters labeled these folks properly as ADVOCATES (kind term for brazen liars, I guess).<br /></p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Had Senator Kerry been elected President, we would be talking about his proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate to 32% and to eliminate the deferral benefits under Subpart F, which would have reduced the temptation to abuse the transfer pricing regulations under section 482.  Instead, there is much discussion of The American Jobs Creation Act, including <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/11/american-jobs-creation-act-and.html">my own</a>, which may have been a bit premature. </p>
<p>I say premature as recent discussions of this new law suggests that for most domestic sectors, all profits will qualify for the “qualified production activities income” (QPAI) deduction, which will be only 9%.  So most companies will have an effective tax rate equal to 91% of 35% or just under the 32% tax rate that Kerry was proposing.  Exceptions remain, however, such as food and beverage companies with retail activities as well as power, water, and natural gas producers with transmission and transportation activities.  The profits from service activities also would not qualify as QPAI.  </p>
<p>But why distinguish between value-added created in most of the U.S. economy versus certain types of value-added created in these sectors?  Those sectors with this type of value-added would have to face both higher effective tax rates and compliance headaches if the IRS accuses them of abusive transfer pricing to get their tax rates down to the levels of companies without these types of value-added activities.  As if the IRS was not already too busy given its limited resources.  </p>
<p>The Kerry plan was both simpler and had the added benefits of accelerating the taxation of profits shifted to offshore shelters under provisions of section 482 such as Cost Sharing – at least as far as how it is practiced.  But now I hear that the IRS is seriously considering letting the QPAI deduction apply to this income as well.  If the deduction applies only after the income is repatriated, then this IRS consideration is sensible. But if the deduction applies before the repatriation of income, Congress has only enhanced the opportunities for tax accountants to rip-off the Treasury with more transfer pricing abuse.  </p>
<p>Of course, the Bush Republicans now say they want tax simplification.  But aren’t these the same fellows that have passed all sorts of loopholes for the rich over the past four years in a matter that have made the tax code more complex?  Maybe Congress passes such convoluted tax laws to increase the demand for tax attorneys.<br /></p>
