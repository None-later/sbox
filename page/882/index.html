                                <p>MEDIA CONTEST: New B-2 readiness reporting &#8211; MESL provides more accurate listing of B-2 capability:</p>
<p>Outstanding New Writer Entry 4D12/28/2006 &#8211; Air Combat Command (USAF), MEDIA CONTEST &#8212;  [ilsm: The Joseph Goebbels award for spreading sunshine.]</p>
<p>28 Dec 2006: Col. Bob Wheeler, 509th Operations Group commander. &#8220;With the limited number of B-2s, every aircraft is critical to the fight. This new system gives our senior leaders a onepage snap-shot of what is available today for any contingencies anywhere in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, we own about 20 B-2&#8217;s and at any given time 14 of these critical airplanes are broken. Either the airplane ain&#8217;t so critical or the fight ain&#8217;t so critical.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Whiteman has been using the revised MESL [ ilsm: MESL is a list of individual systems on the airplane which if broken means the plane cannot do one or more of its mission. safety stuff means no fly, weapons down means cannot shoot] , the B-2&#8217;s mission capable rate has improved. The B-2&#8217;s readiness rate for fiscal year 2005 was 30.5 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>If your porsche were broken 69.5 per cent of the time would you be happy?</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, during all our recent inspections and local exercises, Whiteman met the aircraft tasking &#8216;with flying colors,'&#8221; General Miller said.</p>
<p>They have dumbed down the inspections. To make the B-2 look okay, just honky dorry that 7 of ten are broken all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fiscal 2005 is a perfect example Colonel Dulong added. &#8220;While the single dimensional MC statistic was 30.5 percent, we flew our 6,000 hour flying hour program&#8211;all aircrews were trained, we succeeded at the longest sustained deployment the B-2 weapons system has ever had, and we demonstrated our capabilities in an operational readiness inspection. I applaud Team Whiteman for their phenomenal successes,&#8221; Colonel Dulong said.</p>
<p>Great they get to drive the things 300 hours per airplane aper year, or an astounding 25 hours per month.</p>
<p>There is no weapon system that cannot be shelved. If the right questions are asked, like: &#8220;how much downtime and maintenance costs do we pay for and still say the thing is a wonder weapon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you suppose there is something better we could do with the billion or so a year we spend to keep 6 or 7 of the 20 $2B a piece exceptional capabilities running?</p>

<p>Our graph is a follow-up to what <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/defense-spending.html">Cactus said</a>.  Our graph shows defense spending (as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis) was 4.73% of GDP in 2005.  In 1953, it was 14.73% of GDP.  Then again real GDP in 2005 was about 5.3 times higher than real GDP in 1953.  So after adjusting for inflation, it would seem we were spending 70% more in absolute terms in 2005 than we were in 1953 at the height of the Korean War.  Wars are very expensive things – even if certain neocons four years ago didn’t think so.</p>

                                <p>I haven&#8217;t checked the numbers myself, and reporters often make mistakes, but if <a href="http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/news/nation/16935815.htm">this</a> is accurate, </p>
<blockquote><p>[a]s the Iraq war enters a fifth year, the conflict that President Bush&#8217;s aides once said would all but pay for itself with oil revenues is fueling the highest level of defense spending since World War II.</p>
<p>Even with past spending adjusted upward for inflation, the $630 billion provided for the military this year exceeds the highest annual amounts during the Reagan-era defense buildup, the Vietnam War and the Korean War.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which makes no sense whatsoever.  GW is spending  than any of the following:<br />1.  Fighting the Chinese on the Korean peninsula<br />2.  Facing off the Soviet Union and fighting several proxy wars against a fellow superpower<br />3.  Fighting a Soviet supplied and trained enemy in Vietnam</p>
<p>Considering that the fight is not only ongoing, but not going particularly well (unless you&#8217;re Osama), we can conclude one of the following:<br />a.  The combination of second rate religious fanatics and cave dwellers our troops are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, together with Pakistani intelligence and Saudi volunteers makes for a more formidable foe than the Chinese People&#8217;s Liberation Army  and the USSR<br />b.  GW and his people are incredibly incompetent and if they had an ounce of patriotism between all of them, they&#8217;d resign en masse so as not to cause any further damage</p>
<p>I know which option to which I&#8217;m leaning.  And I&#8217;m proud to say I voted against GW twice.</p>

                                <p>The tag line for the latest from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWIzZmMwZDYyMGI4NWRlODRhY2M5MjdiODIyZmIxZjI=">Rich Lowry</a> reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>What happens to a civil war if only one side shows up to fight it?</p></blockquote>
<p>The question was so odd that I decided to read the latest babbling from Mr. Lowry only to discover this:<br />
<blockquote>This progress might be transitory, but it illustrates the falsity of a key assumption of Democrats. They prefer to talk of Iraq in terms of a civil war because it suggests that nothing can be done about the violence, that it is running its own hermetic course. Well, it clearly isn’t. What the U.S. does matters. If we hadn’t surged, Baghdad already might have descended into the genocidal fury toward which it was headed earlier in the year. The other side of the Iraqi civil war &#8211; the car-bombing Sunni terrorists &#8211; hasn’t stood down, of course. But these are the people that Democrats express a notional interest in fighting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh?  Lowry earlier noted that the “Shia militias that had become the main driver of violence in Baghdad” and concedes that they are ducking the U.S. troops for a while.  So aren’t we helping the Sunnis with this surge, wave, or whatever you want to call it?  For Lowry to suggest that we Democrats want to fight the Sunnis is absurd.  Now if one goes back four years ago, it was his crowd that pushed for the 3/19/2003 invasion to oust the ruling Sunnis.  But that doesn’t stop Lowry from writing:<br />
<blockquote>According to a U.S. intelligence report quoted by the New York Times, captured materials from al Qaeda in Iraq say that the group sees “the sectarian war for Baghdad as the necessary main focus of its operations.” So the Democrats profess to want to fight terrorists in Iraq, and al Qaeda in Iraq is making Baghdad its focus. It would stand to reason, then, that the Democrats wouldn’t want to undermine our effort to control Baghdad. Our counterinsurgency mission there is a counterterrorism mission. It aims to squeeze out terrorists, neighborhood by neighborhood. Nonetheless, Democrats in the House and Senate are attempting to force our troops from Baghdad, exactly as al Qaeda in Iraq wants. There is an essential symmetry to the goals of Sunni militants and Democrats here at home with regard to the disposition of our forces — the fewer, the farther away from Baghdad, the better (needless to say, for vastly different reasons). In reporting on al Qaeda in Iraq’s strategy, the New York Times notes, “American forces, instead of withdrawing from the capital as the Sunni insurgents had hoped, prepared plans to reinforce their troops there.” Over the strenuous objections of Democrats.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds a lot like the babble from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/03/20070319-1.html">Tony Snow</a> yesterday:<br />
<blockquote>Do they think that you ought to seek victory. If you ask, if the alternative is creating a power vacuum that will encourage terrorists and also creating a launching pad for terror, people don&#8217;t want that. So, again, a lot of times you can frame questions in different ways. But let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; people don&#8217;t like war. But on the other hand, people also don&#8217;t like terrorists on our shores, they don&#8217;t like a strengthening capability among members of the international terror network, and the President has to keep all those things in mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words – unless we are in the middle of the Shia-Sunni bloodbath, Al Qaeda will attack us?  This is the incredibly stupid “logic” that got us in this mess in the first damn place.  Rich Lowry can’t articulate who the real enemy is very clearly.  Then again – he and his crowd have always been engaged in a war against Democrats.</p>

                                <p>Regular readers may recall I grew up abroad.  But I recall that on those summers that I spent in the US at my grandparent&#8217;s home, when I needed a haircut, my grandfather would take me to the same barbershop to which he went.  My grandfather passed away a few years ago at 95.  The barbershop is also gone.</p>
<p>For the past few years, I&#8217;ve been getting my hair cut at one of those Fantastic Sums or Supercuts &#8211; I&#8217;m not even sure which &#8211; around the corner from my apartment.  Now, at the Ex-GF&#8217;s place in Silver Lake, I have been frequenting an actual honest to goodness old-style barbershop.  Not the really old style, medieval bloodletting places, but the kind of place you probably would have seen in the 1950s.  Its not exactly like the 1950s &#8211; there&#8217;s an ethnically mixed clientelle, they use electric clippers, there&#8217;s a tv on the wall, and some of the magazines are from more recent decades as well.  </p>
<p>Prices are about the same as at a Fantastic Sam&#8217;s or Supercuts or wherever I was going for the past few years, and I like the haircut better.  I note this place doesn&#8217;t seem to have any trouble attracting business.  So why are barbershops disappearing?</p>

                                <p>Does <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZjhlMjdiZDA2MjE4MDVhMzI4YjcxMTg5MjBhNjhmM2E=">Jerry Bowyer</a> thinks macroeconomists have some crystal ball?  I guess any suggestion that the recovery might get derailed has to be shot down by the Bush cheerleaders at the National Review but criticizing Greenspan for not predicting the 1990 and 2001 recessions is just stupid:</p>
<blockquote><p>After all, if the former Maestro wasn’t able to call recessions when he was running a forecasting firm, we can hardly expect him to do so now. Reportedly, Townsend, Greenspan and Co. predicted only one of the many recessions that occurred between 1954 and 1987. But Greenspan’s record didn’t improve all that much during his two decades at the Fed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bowyer must have missed what <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/business/yourmoney/04view.html?ex=1330664400&#038;en=d4c5a774ecf34ae0&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink">Daniel Gross</a> recently wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Noting that while a recession in 2007 is possible, he elaborated: “I don’t think it’s probable.” But his comments — and the global reaction — raise a larger question: If a recession were imminent, would Mr. Greenspan, or any less august economist, be able to forecast it? The answer, based on recent experience, is a resounding no. “I don’t think we, as a profession, ever had an ability to forecast recessions,” said Jeffrey A. Frankel, professor of economics at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and a member of the National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee, the official arbiter of recessions. “It’s hard enough to know when a recession has started, looking at it with hindsight.” Indeed. No disrespect to Mr. Greenspan, but neither he nor the similarly numerate members of his professional fraternity have a particularly good record of forecasting recessions. The Economist reported that in March 2001 &#8211; the month the last recession began &#8211; 95 percent of American economists believed that there wouldn’t be a recession. In February 2001, the 35 professional forecasters surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia collectively predicted growth at an annual rate of 2.2 percent for the second quarter of 2001 and 3.3 percent for the third quarter. It’s as if meteorologists stood outside as the storm clouds approached and informed television viewers that endless sunshine was ahead.</p></blockquote>
<p>Come to think of it – no one at the National Review was publishing a 2001 forecast that indicated that GDP would fall.</p>

<p>While neither an alarmist nor a pessimist by outlook when it comes to the US economy, I’ve been reading a whole host of warnings lately.  (Disclosure: There are many places to turn for opinions and you can always find some that agree with your beliefs.  I’m frankly very concerned and very “short” all equity markets for now.)  These warnings either focus on (1) how the changed nature of mortgage lending in the last several years is leading to a mortgage market contraction, (2) to warnings that risk generally has become mis-priced by investors in broader markets.  I’ve been disturbed to note that some $57 billion was quietly flung into the financial markets by the Fed and the Treasury Department in the last two days of last week through short term lending operations.  These lendings are made to the 21 “primary” broker/dealers who feed money to lower tier banks and brokers.  Some of the sources of my own disquiet are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  <a href="http://fms.treas.gov/tip/reports.html">Treasury’s short term operational reports</a> and <a href="http://fms.treas.gov/tip/reports.html">short term Fed operations</a>. </p>

A frank statement by a private equity operator on 3/14/2007:  Steven Rattner, former Lazard co-hort of Felix Rohatyn,  now chief buyout man at his own outfit, Quadrangle, spoke to Bloomberg News in an interview and said: &#8220;there may be a change, that this gushing well of liquidity that we&#8217;ve all enjoyed for the past several years now is coming to an end.  Our view for some time has been that we are in a credit bubble and that there is money being lent and that we&#8217;re happily borrowers of it on the private equity side at rates and on terms that really frankly don&#8217;t make a great deal of sense from the standpoint of the lenders&#8230;but we&#8217;re the borrowers, and we&#8217;re happy to take advantage of that, and so as long as we can continue to finance our deals with that money, we will continue to do it.&#8221; </p>

<p>Question:  Are people crying “Wolf!” about a relatively healthy economy, or talking about a big lesson coming in how to price risk in financial markets?  What should you do about it, if anything?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>A few weeks ago, I had a few posts looking at whether the Fed acts to improperly influence elections.  I noted among other things that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and_06.html">real M1 per capita</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and_9610.html">real M2 per capita</a>, and the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and_05.html">fed funds rate</a> all seem to follow the pattern one would expect if the Fed was trying to help its friends and hurt its enemies.  In other words… the money supply was looser (i.e., real M2 per capita and real M1 per capita were higher, the Fed Funds rate was lower) in years in which an incumbent President was running for re-election, provided that incumbent was from the same party as the Fed chair.  Conversely, the money supply was tighter when an incumbent from a different party than the Fed Chair was running.  In years in which there was no election, or no incumbent running, the monetary policy fell somewhere in between the two extremes.</p>
<p>Readers got tired of the topic, but I still have a few things I want to look at on the topic, which means there are a still posts.  Hopefully enough time has elapsed for another installment.</p>
<p>So far I have looked at fed funds rate, which the Fed controls completely, as well as M1 and M2, over which the Fed tries to control through the fed funds rate, open market operations, moral suasion, jawboning, and the required reserve ratio.  This post looks at data over which the Fed doesn’t have control, namely the ten year treasuries.  </p>
<p>Now, how would a cynic who feels that Fed is trying to influence elections expect the 10 year treasuries to behave?  Would that cynic expect the 10 year treasuries to behave the way the other charts behave?  Well, a cynic might expect that when the Fed is tightening up the money supply, it will cause the 10 year bond interest rate to rise.  This is because the Fed Funds rate acts as a floor on all other interest rates.  Thus, if the Fed Funds rate rises by two percentage points throughout a year, odds are the 10 year bond rate will do something roughly similar.</p>
<p>But what happens if the Fed Funds rate falls?  Will the 10 year bond rate fall?  It might.  But it might not.  That would require a greater willingness to loan out funds by potential lenders (which may occur due to looser money), but also an expectation on the part of potential investors that the US government and US economy has become a less risky place to park one’s money.  Will this happen because of Fed machinations?  Probably not.</p>
<p>Thus, a cynic would expect that around the time of elections in which an incumbent from a party other than the Fed’s chair is running, 10 year bond interest rates will be higher than they would be at any other time.  (Thus, as with the other series, things will be least favorable to the economy and the White House.)  But, the same cynic would not have any reason to expect the lowest 10 year bond interest rates to occur when an incumbent from the same party as the Fed’s chair is running for re-election, since the Fed’s loosening stance on real M1 per capita, real M2 per capita, and the Fed Funds rate will not translate to the 10 year bond market.  </p>
<p>So what do we (cynics and non-cynics alike) see?</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rf6INhx2MsI/AAAAAAAAAIs/sClq-UKsnmM/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+7,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rf6INhx2MsI/AAAAAAAAAIs/sClq-UKsnmM/s320/Fed+Independence+7,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Well, there aren’t many observations in columns 3 and 4, but they fit with this cynic’s prediction.  The argument about a small number of observations stops flying after a while when the predictions work monthly, and when they work on many disparate series (real M1 per capita, real M2 per capita, fed funds rate, and now 10 year treasuries).  </p>
<p>Why the second column shows the loosest money supply most of the time, I really don’t know.  Maybe I haven’t gotten as cynical as I should.</p>
<p>I hope to return to this topic in the next couple of weeks with a post about whether the Fed’s changes in the Fed Funds rate lead or follow changes in the economy’s growth rate, and whether the pattern looks different (and specifically, whether the pattern looks the way a cynic would expect) in years in which there is a Presidential election.  </p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Reader ILSM continues his commentary on the new F-22 fighter.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>I have compared the F-22, a &#8220;fifth generation fighter&#8221;, to a Porsche which has no road to run on.  I have implied there are no threat aircraft out there.  That may or may not be the case.  The only other &#8220;fifth generation fighter&#8221; is the US F-35.  The Russian design houses are working on &#8220;fifth generation&#8221; designs.</p>
<p>Doing a bit of research I find I am in part wrong.  There are potential competitors; some are supposed to be quite equal to the F-22.  Aside from the Russians and Chinese, who use Russian designs and engines, the competitors for the F-22 are Europeans, supposedly our allies.   The Chinese are delivering their indigenous J-10, a generation 4.5.</p>
<p>The recently retired chief of staff of the Air Force, who should be more knowledgeable than I, flew both the F-22 and the Eurofighter Typhoon.  He said the Typhoon was a “NASCAR racer” while the F-22 was a “Formula-1 racer, cannot compare the two”.  I would not buy a car from him.</p>
<p>The F-22 specification was written in 1979, and has been changed a lot over the past 28 years.  The prototype contract was let in 1986, the design selected in 1991 and the first crash took place in Apr 1992.  The first unit received F-22s in 2004, twenty five years! </p>
<p>It has survived huge cost increases, and long delays.</p>
<p>Technical advances in the F-22 are: low supersonic cruise without afterburner, maneuverability, avionics and stealth.  </p>
<p>In comments on another thread, reader Buffpilot said the F-22 shot down 5 or 6 fourth generation aircraft in a scripted flying simulation.  I have seen reported simulations nearer to 1 to 1 with generation 4.5 Typhoon adversaries. </p>
<p>Generation 4.5 jet fighters are: late models of the F-16, F-15 and F-18; the Chinese J-10, a MiG, an Su and the Eurofighter.  </p>
<p>The US has spent 25 years and a huge amount of money to build a totally new aircraft that is marginally equal to the competition in air combat or dogfighting.  So, it needs other work.  It needs to shoot down cruise missiles; which means it needs large numbers and time on station to be a platform for air to air missiles, a job that should be done by older F-16’s with new avionics.  </p>
<p>It needs to be an interceptor, just like the F-106, my generation air defense with delta wings and one engine controlled by off system intelligence.  It is optimized for fighting dog fights but is so expensive it needs to do other things.</p>
<p>Do we really need a dog fighter?  I would propose a look toward the battleship war during WW I.  The battleships were so vital and so expensive that the Germans never came out with them.  The Germans and British deterred each other.  They found other ways to do the war at sea, submarines.</p>
<p>What should the we do if:</p>
<p>The F-22 is barely equal to the Typhoon or J-10?</p>
<p>Is far Superior to the Typhoon or J-10?</p>
<p>Is inferior to the Typhoon or J-10?</p>
<p>My answer to all three potential truths, which we won’t know, is keep working on a design and do not build nor train with the F-22.  The ability of the plane to solve a set of tactical opponents is not clear.</p>
<p>Same for the F-35.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/03/bad-loans-banks-and-coming-credit.html">Kash</a> and <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/183071">Nouriel Roubini</a> are worried that the bad loans in the subprime market may spillover onto the rest of the economy via a credit crunch.  AB reader OldVet points us towards <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/IC16Dj05.html">Jephraim Gundzik</a> who is concerned with increasing perceptions of risk:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plunging stock markets around the world and dollar depreciation indicate that risk perceptions are changing dramatically. This change in risk perception will produce a prolonged and sharp correction in all of the world&#8217;s stock markets. Growing risk aversion will push US Treasury yields lower, triggering dollar devaluation and soaring precious-metals prices in the months ahead.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gundzik argues that the expansionary monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan “masked rising global investment risk”.  He also argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed reversed course in late 2004, but the very slow pace of monetary-policy tightening did little to weaken thriving mortgage-credit growth, which continued to bound higher in 2005. The combination of super-loose monetary policy and very gradual monetary-policy tightening encouraged mortgage lenders in the US greatly to loosen credit standards, triggering unprecedented growth in US real-estate values and home construction. The booming housing market accelerated US economic growth, further obscuring investment risk associated with very rapid credit growth and sharply deteriorating credit standards &#8230; Though monetary policy in the US and Japan remains extremely loose, the sudden downdraft in global equity markets and dollar depreciation, which began early this month, indicate that risk perceptions have changed dramatically. This sudden shift was driven by unexpected weakness in the US economy &#8211; the product of the collapsing housing market, soaring real-estate foreclosures, and their very negative impact on the US financial system.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we are about to see an investment slump – I trust these folks are not saying we need to return to tight monetary policy.  Actually, I tend to agree with Gundzik as he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though interest rates will fall in the US, this will not immediately stimulate a resurgence in the housing market. Mortgage lenders and banks saddled with growing non-performing loan portfolios will continue to tighten credit standards, leaving many potential borrowers in the cold. At the same time, surging foreclosures will add to the housing supply, forcing home prices much lower. This loss of home equity combined with a credit drought will undercut private demand in the US, prompting a rise in unemployment and further weakness in private demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also sounds pessimistic about world business investment demand.  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve does not appear to share this pessimism.  I hope Ben Bernanke is correct, but I don’t envy his job over the next several months.</p>
