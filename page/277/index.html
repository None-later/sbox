<p>This is a simple little exercise that frankly I wonder why no one with a pulpit (that would be you congress critters, executive office and MSM) has done it. It is for those who think simplistically. Thinking like:  wealthy people create jobs with their extra money and not the non-wealthy people&#8217;s demand for stuff that makes them feel wealthy.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that tax cuts create jobs.  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/extending-tax-cuts-for-wealthy.html">770,000 jobs</a>  for what is it, $4 trillion over 10 years? The obvious question is: How many jobs do we really need for that money to break even? Come on conservatives, you&#8217;re suppose to be the &#8220;efficient minded&#8221; thinkers. How many jobs would it take to pay it back? <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Median household income for 2009 is $49,777. 5% less than the peak of 1999 by the way. Full time working men it was $47,127, women $36,278. Per capita income was $26,530. These numbers are from <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf">here</a>.  </p>
<p>Using the household income number just because, in 10 years, you would need <strong>80,358,389</strong> jobs created to equal the tax cut.. Eighty plus million jobs. Of course, that we created these jobs does not mean all that money is paying for the $4trillion in lost tax collections. Only a percentage of the income is collected by We the People as income tax. Based on the <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/250.html">Tax Foundations data</a> that figures out to an average of 12.68% of taxable income paid as income taxes. Thus, $6,311.72 is paid for income tax for the median household income.</p>
<p>Stay with me here, this is simple. $4 trillion divided by $6311.72 is: <strong>633,741,674</strong> jobs in ten years. About double our total population in 10 years needs to be working. </p>
<p>Our policies have to start producing 63,374,674 jobs as soon as the tax cuts are passed, at the beginning of each year (&#8217;cause we need to collect the full $6311.72 at the end of each year) to pay for the tax cut. That is over the year, we need the equivalent of 63,374,674 jobs each having generated $49,777 of taxable income to make the mark for paying off the tax cut for that year. Not every job will pay that much for the year, so we actually need more than 63,374,674 jobs. That is, unless magically at one tick past midnight New Years Eve suddenly we have those jobs paying at that rate. </p>
<p>Sixty three million jobs per year. Really? Come on, you think this is possible? This nation is gonna need a lot more copulation and immigration happening over the next ten years for that to happen. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say it is possible, just not here. China?</p>
<p>Not even in<a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-09/18/content_11320661.htm"> China</a> can do it, as they only managed 22 million jobs in 2 years . Though they did manage to provide 112 million more willing workers over the last 10 years. Problem is, even at 22 million jobs, those sure are not at a median income of <a href="http://siakhenn.tripod.com/capita.html#C">$49,777/year</a>.</p>
<p>So.  Really&#8230; tax cuts? LOL. Pay for them with job creation? Oh please, you&#8217;re kill me!</p>

<p><strong>Demand a Supply of Common Sense; Just Don’t Price It</strong><br />by Brian Czech</p>
<p>Ah, the confusion of economics students when they encounter the subject of supply and demand in introductory “micro.” They learn that prices are determined by supply and demand. Then they’re taught that the quantities supplied and demanded are determined by… prices!</p>
<p>There happens to be no lurking inconsistency here, no magic trick to dazzle us; not even a ridiculous fallacy to accuse the professor of. It’s just a matter of semantics; supply is not the same as “quantity supplied” and demand is not the same as “quantity demanded.” <br />&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>So Americans know quite well how Big Money can pollute the truth. Can we expect the mother of all money-making theories, unlimited growth theory – along with its crazy correlates – to come to us on wings of truth? Sure, sure, higher prices stemming from lowered supplies actually “increase” supplies because they provide an incentive to “supply” even more. And more smoke makes the air “cleaner” by providing an incentive for smokers to increase the “supply” of clean air. More traffic increases the “supply” of open road. More noise actually leads to a greater “supply” of quietness. Less of a good thing leads to more of it! More of a bad thing leads to less of it! Or, if you prefer, less of a good thing leads to less of a bad thing, and more of a bad thing leads to more of a good thing!</p>
<p>So if the growthmen want to claim that oil supplies, for example, are actually increasing, not decreasing, as evidenced by a downturn in price, let them play with the word “supply” like the Seven Dwarves play with “addictive!” Let them use “supply” to mean more, less, an OK mess, anybody’s guess … whatever. But may the rest of us not sound, as one old hand used to say, “Dummer’n a doggone boot!” Supply is how much there is, after all, and as you use it, less remains.<br />&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>and lifted from comments is the <strong>Sandwichman</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amen. And let’s not forget unemployment. According to the growth orthodoxy, unemployment creates jobs. How does this happen? Easy! Unemployed workers are willing to work for less money, which drives down the cost of labor. The lower cost of labor creates an incentive for investors to hire people to produce more goods and services (at a lower price). All the newly employed unemployed people can then go out and buy the cheaper goods and services with their lower wages. That is unless there is unemployment insurance to keep people from supplying their labor at a lower cost. And if you don’t swallow that crock of bull, you’re committing the “fallacy” of assuming there is “only a fixed amount of work to be done.”</p>
<p>So remember, folks, unemployment creates jobs… and more smoke makes the air cleaner.</p></blockquote>

<p>HOW TO PAY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY<br />BALANCE THE BUDGET CUT THE DEFICIT<br />and REDUCE THE NATIONAL DEBT</p>
<p>Big Numbers and Mental Hygiene</p>
<p>We have been treated recently to a great deal of hysteria about &#8220;the deficit&#8221; and the huge horrible Burden of Social Security, including the mysterious Trust Fund: is it real? or only Phony Iou&#8217;s? has it been Looted? or will it Cripple the Economy to pay it back? and why should I Pay Twice for my Social Security? And how did Social Security run up such a Huge Debt anyway? and when exactly is it Going Broke?</p>
<p>All of this is nonsense: Carefully constructed nonsense by the highly paid non partisan experts who dwell in Big Think Tanks dwelling on these things, thinking of better ways to fool the people into cutting off their heads to save the cost of tomorrow&#8217;s dinner. They don&#8217;t have to convince you, exactly; they just need to get you to stand quietly or cheer, while they &#8220;fix&#8221; Social Security. Of course, <strong>in their minds &#8220;fixing&#8221; it means ending it</strong>. They don&#8217;t like the idea that the hired help can retire just because they saved enough of their own money to be able to afford to.</p>
<p>I have shown elsewhere how Social Security can pay for itself with a tax raise that amounts to 20 cents per week per year. In that paper I assumed that the Trust Fund would be used as it was intended&#8230; that is the money saved in the Trust Fund, when payroll taxes were higher than needed for current benefits, would be used to help pay for future benefits when payroll taxes might otherwise not be enough to pay for promised benefits. This money has been lent to the government at interest. The enemies of Social Security claim that the United States of America cannot afford to pay back the money it borrowed&#8230; cannot honor its debt to Social Security. In this paper I will show how the country can pay back the money it borrowed from Social Security without imposing an <strong>Intolerable Burden</strong> on anyone.</p>
<p>A good place to begin would be with a set of numbers a Regular Reader sent us last week showing &#8220;the Social Security deficit.&#8221; Regular Reader thinks we need to Look Upon the Very Big Numbers and Be Afraid. Here they are:</p>

<p>Well, these are indeed Very Big Numbers, but we can do better than just stare at them and be afraid. For example, <strong>we can compare them to the income of the people paying the Social Security tax</strong>: The <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#176345" target="_blank">following tables Table VI.F9</a> from the Trustees Report will help us.</p>
<p>Table VI.F9.—OASDI and HI Annual Income Excluding Interest, Cost, and<br />Balance in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2010-85<br />[In billions]<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKDzK2pwAJI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/kkGpeZXNmvc/s1600/vif6.JPG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKDzK2pwAJI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/kkGpeZXNmvc/s320/vif6.JPG"></a></p>
<p>Note that the numbers in the fourth column, under OASDI and Balance, are the same as Regular Reader&#8217;s. Note also that these are Current Dollars&#8230; that is they include inflation. A lot of inflation. Most of the bigness is due to inflation.</p>
<p><strong>[</strong>We are only talking about &#8220;social security&#8221; in this paper. Medicare presents other problems we need to take up separately.<strong>]</strong></p>
<p>And note that the Income does <strong>NOT</strong> include the &#8220;interest&#8221;&#8230; that is the money owed to the Trust Fund. This is &#8220;the deficit&#8221; only if the government does not pay back the money it borrowed from Social Security.</p>
<p>We can stop scaring ourselves with inflated numbers if we just compare the inflated deficit with the inflated incomes of the people paying the payroll tax.</p>
<p>The second table shows Taxable payroll Table VI.F6., in the fourth column, for the same years, also in current dollars.</p>
<p>Table VI.F6.—Selected Economic Variables,<br />Calendar Years 2009-85<br />[GDP and taxable payroll in billions]<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKDzLGoZIGI/AAAAAAAAAaA/o0Mx58zebnE/s1600/vif9.JPG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKDzLGoZIGI/AAAAAAAAAaA/o0Mx58zebnE/s320/vif9.JPG"></a></p>
<p>[by the way: that is indeed 157 Trillion dollars in &#8220;taxable payroll&#8221; for 2085. This is not &#8220;runaway inflation;&#8221; it&#8217;s just what you get when you start with a big number and have it grow 5% per year for 75 years&#8230; you get a Very Big Number.]</p>
<p>If we divide &#8220;the defict&#8221; from the first table, by the &#8220;taxable payroll&#8221; in the second table, we can find the percent the payroll tax rate would have to be increased to cover the deficit without collecting any money from &#8220;the budget,&#8221; that is, without the government repaying any of the money it borrowed from Social Security.</p>

<p>And here we are going to stop for a look at what this means so far. Because at this point the Trust Fund would have been paid back if the Congress was honoring its debt to Social Security. ( <strong>&#8220;Paid Back&#8221;</strong> is what you have been hearing called &#8220;Gone Broke.&#8221; )</p>
<p>First note that the first year, 2010, is this year. This year Congress has found the money to pay the deficit&#8230; that is pay the money it owes to the Social Security Trust Fund. That is, it is paying the &#8220;phony iou&#8217;s.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Second, note that&#8230; if Congress does not pay back the money it owes for any future year, a payroll tax increase of about one tenth of one percent per year would allow the workers&#8230; the people who will eventually need to collect Social Security benefits &#8230; would allow the workers to &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; and pay for all promised benefts until 2020.</p>
<p>One tenth of one percent of payroll is $43 dollars per year for the average worker in 2010 (see table VI.F6 above, third column). This is about 80 cents per week. Note that while incomes are rising, the 80 cents will get bigger, but it will &#8220;feel&#8221; the same to the person earning the increased income. Note also that even though the &#8220;one tenth of one percent increase each year&#8221; adds up to 1 percent after ten years, in any given year the raise will &#8220;feel&#8221; like 80 cents per week would feel to you today.</p>
<p>Go back to Table VI.F6 for the average wage projected for each year, and watch the effect of the tax increases on the &#8220;take home&#8221; of the average worker.</p>
<p>year wage taxrate tax take home<br />2010 43084 0.124 5342 37700<br />2011 44687 0.125 5585 39101<br />2012 46758 0.126 5891 40866<br />2013 48978 0.127 6220. 42757<br />2014 51215 0.128 6555 44659<br />2015 53397 0.129 6888 46508<br />2016 55738 0.130 7245 48492<br />2017 58103 0.131 7611 50491<br />2018 60522 0.132 7988 52533<br />2019 63017 0.133 8381 54635<br />2020 65465 0.134 8772 56692</p>
<p>Notice that even though the tax rate is increasing by a tenth of a percent every year, the &#8220;take home&#8221; increases** by about 2000 dollars per year. For those who say, &#8220;yeah, but I could have had more,&#8221; it is necessary to remind them that they haven&#8217;t lost anything. The tax will come back to them when they retire and need it most. And notice also that even in 2020 when the tax is one percent higher than it would have been, the difference is only 12 dollars per week, out of an income of 1200dollars per week. And you get it back with interest.</p>
<p>The same analysis would give essentially the same result over the years from 2020 to 2035, but the rate of increase in the tax would be a 0.15% (one and a half tenths of a percent) per year, a little bigger than for the first ten years, but still not a &#8220;burden.&#8221; I&#8217;ll leave the details to you.</p>
<p><strong>[</strong>There is a small error in the above table that actually makes the tax bite look worse than it should. The &#8220;wage&#8221; given is the &#8220;nominal wage.&#8221; The employee&#8217;s tax rate on this wage is only half the given tax rate. If you wish to insist that the &#8220;employer&#8217;s share&#8221; is &#8220;really the employee&#8217;s money&#8221; then you would need to add half the &#8220;tax&#8221; to the &#8220;wage&#8221; to get the employee&#8217;s &#8220;true wage&#8221; before you subtracted the full tax. Then you would get a take home equal to the &#8220;take home&#8221; as given PLUS half the &#8220;tax&#8221; as given.<strong>]</strong></p>
<p>So let us look at where we have come. We have shown that even if the government does not pay back the money it borrowed from Social Security, the workers can continue to pay all promised benefits themselves, on a pay as you go basis, with a tax increase that would be barely felt. It is important to understand this. Because while Congress not repaying the Trust Fund would be a theft.. a breach of the &#8220;Full faith and credit of the United States,&#8221; it would be better for the workers to just write it off as a bad debt and pay the extra costs themselves.</p>
<p>It would be better for them to lose a little money than to lose the Social Security program to those who want to &#8220;fix&#8221; it by raising the retirement age, or cutting benefits so the workers can&#8217;t afford to retire, or &#8220;means testing&#8221; it, or even raising the &#8220;cap&#8221;, so that Social Security becomes just another welfare program and can be killed off later. Moreover, the <em>workers don&#8217;t WANT welfare. They want a way to insure their savings against inflation and market losses and personal losses of various kinds. That way is Social Security and it has worked for over 70 years.</em> Social Security benefits are more than half the income of more than half of all retired people. A great deal more than half for more than 40% of them, and not an insignificant part of the income of even those who are doing better than most.</p>
<p>However, let us not write off the bad debt just yet. Because there is another table you need to see:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKDXFod3DII/AAAAAAAAAZo/_s9SDKyQYCw/s1600/sstables1.JPG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKDXFod3DII/AAAAAAAAAZo/_s9SDKyQYCw/s320/sstables1.JPG"></a></p>
<p>Inspection of this table shows that the Adjusted Gross Income of those taxpayers with AGI greater than 100k/yr (in 2006) is nearly the same as the total AGI of those taxpayers with AGI less than 100k/yr. Since the payroll tax is paid on wage income less than 100k, and wage income over 100k and all non wage income, pays NO payroll tax, the money owed to Social Security, that we have just shown could be made up by a tax increase of about one tenth percent per year, up to 3 and a half percent over 25 years, could be paid instead by the same tax rate on those making more than 100k/yr.</p>
<p>Since the approx 3% tax cut in 2001 went mostly to those making over 100k, it would not seem obviously unfair to ask those making over 100k to pay the 3% tax increase necessary to make good on the loan they got from SS. It might be more fair to apply the tax increase to income over 100k (people who make over 100k also make under 100k). This would change the top marginal rates, but that should be done in a way that increases the tax on incomes over 100k the same 3% &#8220;on average.</p>
<p>Whether or not it is &#8220;fair&#8221; (it is), it is plain that the &#8220;Social Security deficit&#8221; could be paid for with a tax increase on those making over 100k of one tenth of one percent per year, reaching 1% by 2020 and ultimately reaching 3.5% in 2035 and THEN STOPPING. After 2036 the Trust Fund would be fully repaid. So &#8220;the rich&#8221; would face a &#8220;surtax averaging less than 3% per year for ten years to pay down that part of the national debt owed to the people who already paid for their Social Security. This is not a crushing burden.</p>
<p>In no case would anyone be &#8220;paying for Social Security twice.&#8221; SS was paid for once. Paying back the Trust Fund would be paying, the first time, once, for whatever the Congress bought with the money it borrowed FROM Social Security. Even if the workers decided to write off the bad debt and pay for Social Security going forward, pay as you go, with a payroll tax raise greater, or sooner, than they expected, they would still be paying for their Social Security only once. They would expect to get back even their increased payment in the form of an adequate retirement benefit for their own longer life expectancy. As the ad says, this is &#8220;priceless.&#8221; There might be some minor &#8220;inequity&#8221; in the &#8220;rate of return&#8221; from one generation to the other, but no more than the inequity that comes from a change in the price of bread, or bonds, or going to war, or living through a recession. The point is that it is the workers ONLY way to INSURE that they will have &#8220;enough&#8221; when they need, or want, to retire.</p>
<p>As to whether or not a 3% increase in the effective tax rate of the top 10% of earners would be unduly oppressive, let us look at another table:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKDXFod3DII/AAAAAAAAAZo/_s9SDKyQYCw/s1600/sstables1.JPG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKDXFod3DII/AAAAAAAAAZo/_s9SDKyQYCw/s320/sstables1.JPG"></a></p>
<p>Note that a 3% tax increase would bring the tax rate up to less than it was in 2000, and would range from 16% to 27%. No fun for them perhaps, but not a crushing burden, and it would be for less than ten years.</p>
<p>Before leaving I would like to point out two other things, which I will not &#8220;prove.&#8221; First is that if a 3% increase in the tax on the wealthiest 10% for ten years can pay back the Trust Fund, and reduce the National Debt by about 6 Trillion dollars from what it would have been, it ought to be apparent that a 3% increase for more than ten years ought to be able to reduce that part of the National Debt that was borrowed from &#8220;the public.&#8221; How long that takes to bring the Debt down to a &#8220;sustainable level&#8221; depends on other spending.</p>
<p>The other thing is that it is dishonest to count &#8220;projected deficits&#8221; that include future increased costs of Social Security or even Medicare. I have shown how with a tiny increase in the payroll tax, Social Security can and should pay for itself. A similar increase would cover Medicare&#8230; though there the real savings needs to come from controlling health care costs. In any case people will need health care and cutting Medicare will not help them pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s look at one more table:</strong></p>
<p>This is a continuation of the table above comparing the Social Security &#8220;deficit&#8221; to the taxable payroll. But this time we are going to look at what happens after 2035:</p>

<p><strong>Remember that after 2036 the Trust Fund is paid back. Social Security is on its own, pay as you go.</strong> Remember also that we left the tax rate at 3.5% in 2035 higher than it is in 2010. These are the further increases (total increases) that would be needed to pay for the projected &#8220;Social Security Deficit&#8221; after that time&#8230; the biggest of the Big Numbers.</p>
<p>What I want you to notice here is that in fifty years, the needed increase in the payroll tax would be 0.65%, or 0.65/50 = 0.013%, about one eight of one tenth of one percent per year. Remember that in today&#8217;s terms one tenth of one percent is 80 cents per week. One eighth of one tenth of one percent is ten cents per week per year. And the worker only pays half of that. That is your huge horrible hairy &#8220;social security deficit.&#8221;</p>
<p>**[note: this is not quite correct. Since we are dealing with &#8220;inflated&#8221; wages, you have no easy way to know how much of that 2000 dollars is &#8220;real.&#8221; Easiest way for me to give you a better idea is to say that the Trustees predict that real wages will grow by about one full percent per year. So for any year, for every thousand dollars per week you earn, your wages next year will grow by ten dollars in real value, and the one tenth of one percent payroll tax increase will take back one dollar to save for your longer retirement. So you will only be nine dollars better off than you were the year before in terms of money to spend immediately. You will be enormously better off when you retire and find you have enough to live on after all.]] </p></div>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Let us first stipulate that houses themselves are unique entities, but similar enough that we can consider them comparable if not fungible. (In this, they are like any financial asset.) Let us further restrict them in acknowledging that there are significant transaction costs: one’s liquidity preference should not prefer housing to, say, cash-equivalents or marketable commodities, but they are arguably more liquid than a piece of sports memorabilia or antiquarian books or the like. (Given leisure and choice, one sells a copy of <em>Action Comics #1</em> before one sells a residence; given a need for liquidity and reduced price uncertainty, this preference may change.  The implications of this are left as an exercise.)</p>
<p>Assume a standard lifecycle model with intergenerational wealth transfer; we should perhaps stipulate credit constraints in the first (accrual) period, but that assumption can be relaxed during the second (consumption/transfer) period.</p>
<p>As a complicating factor—or rather, to reflect reality—stipulate that in areas that lack significant emigration, transfer of housing assets commonly is done as a continuous flow (that is, the final stages of transfer are from “empty nest’ to Gen2 living with and supporting Gen1 to Gen2 possessing the domicile as the overlap ceases to be), while areas with notable emigration patterns tend to monetize the housing asset and transfer the cash-and-marketable-securities equivalent to the next Generation.</p>
<p>As a further complicating factor to the above, lands that tend to lack emigration may become areas from which people immigrate. Similarly, some areas may become loci of emigration as employment patterns shift and true Structural Change promulgates through a system.</p>
<p>In such a model, the housing component serves the dual purpose of providing housing and being a vehicle for savings.  Not a good vehicle for savings, under normal circumstances, but a piece of equity that can be passed to the next generation—either as a lump sum cash equivalent or as a domicile, depending on the externalities discussed in the <em>Action Comics #1 </em>parenthetic.)</p>
<p>This effectively transforms all housing purchases into rentals—rent for the generation, passing equity accrued to the next in whichever form is optimal.</p>
<p>From that point, it seems intuitive that if the incentive structure changes significantly—if, for instance, one can realize a substantially greater return from owning and selling than from renting—that a bubble <em>might</em> develop.  And as more people are incented to do what they ordinarily would not—to sell a house, to “trade up,” or to otherwise find ways to realize the gains that come from a relative mispricing in the market—that what might become a bubble either (1) will return toward its original trajectory, (2) will revert toward its original trajectory (though it may find a different [higher or lower] equilibrium point, or (3) grow until it is a clear bubble, that will burst.</p>
<p>Note that we can see graphically the difference between the non-bubble states ([1] and [2]) and the bubble state—the first two would show a sign of mean reversion (a decline), while the Bubble State continues to rise.  I wonder if there might be any evidence for one or the other of those hypotheses?</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/09/inequality-as-a-critical-cause-of-the-financial-crisis.html"><strong>Inequality as a critical cause of the financial crisis?</strong></a></p>
<p>As readers know, <em>Ataxingmatter</em> is premised on a concept that I have called &#8220;democratic egalitarianism.&#8221; that This is the idea that sustainable democracy requires forces that push economic and other resources towards a more equal distribution rather than permitting resources to accrue more and more to the already powerful and well-resourced amongst us.  Redistribution, that is, occurs all the time in every economy.  Much of redistribution is redistribution upwards&#8211;power accrues power; wealth accrues wealth; and accordingly opportunity accrues opportunity.  Taxation is one of the mechanisms that society can use to counter the natural tendency towards redistribution upwards.  In a democracy, that mechanism is necessarily and appropriately limited, but it can be servicable on a small scale.  Thus, mechanisms such as income rather than consumption taxation, progressive tax rates, taxation of large estates passed to beneficiaires, exemptions and refundable credits sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood for those who have (and earn) least, and similar provisions can serve to switch the default direction of redistribution from &#8216;redistribution to the have-mores&#8217; to &#8216;redistribution to the have-nots&#8217; at least to some degree.</p>
<p>So how does that view of democracy and the need for &#8220;democratic egalitarianism&#8221; impact upon one&#8217;s understanding of the causes and appropriate cures for the financial crisis that expanded into a deep recession bordering on depression?</p>
<p>In my own analysis of the financial crisis (to be published by the IMF, and currently available through SSRN here), I focused primarily on the deregulation/privatization/and tax cutting at the core of the reaganomics trickle-down ideology and the way that led to a predatory casino banking mentality that in turn was fed by the ease of speculation made possible by financial product innovations like naked credit default swaps.  Similarly, the risk inherent in this type of banking was increased as institutions consolidated, increasing in resources and in interconnections with other financial institutions (including through the use of new-fangled derivatives). <br /><a name="more"></a><br />I didn&#8217;t focus, though, on a singular fact about our society that relates to our deepest economic woes during the Great Depression as well as our current Great Recession&#8211;the rapid growth of inequality, and the attitudinal changes that likely accompany that (e.g., rampant expansion of greed as a primary motivating factor for human behavior, acceptance of incredible differences in access to resources and influence over governmental decisions without an acknowledgement of corresponding obligations, predatory behavior by lenders and other businesses).  But surely it is noteworthy that of all the remedies that could have been taken to address the economic crisis that developed out of the financial institution crisis, the only one that would have kept more people in their homes and protected entire neighborhoods and cities from the blight of foreclosed properties&#8211;permitting bankruptcy adjustments of home mortgage loan principal amounts&#8211;was never a real option.  Banks ended up being more important than millions of homeowners (and the communities that were impacted by their homelessness and joblessness).</p>
<p>Raymond H. Brescia, at Albany Law School, has filled that gap, with an article titled <a target="_blank" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1661746">The Cost of Inequality: Social Distance, Predatory Conduct, and the Financial Crisis</a> (draft Aug. 17, 2010) (available on SSRN).  He starts with a pair of quotes that are noteworthy in themselves. </p>
<blockquote><p>An imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest and most fatal ailments [sic] of all republics.  Plutarch</p>
<p>The injunction of Jesus to love others as ourselves is a recognition of self-interest . . . We have to tolerate the inequality as a way to achieving greater prosperity and opportunity for all.  Lord Brian Griffiths, Vice Chairman, Goldman Sachs International</p></blockquote>
<p>In the abstract, Brescia explains that the &#8220;stunning increase in income inequality&#8230;was reminiscent of &#8230; the years leading up to the Great Depression.&#8221;   In the paper, this is illustrated with the following graph:  Table Three: Share of Total Income Going to Top 10%, id. at 14.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKEbxyB5RhI/AAAAAAAAAaI/8wrmA7jH40g/s1600/linda.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKEbxyB5RhI/AAAAAAAAAaI/8wrmA7jH40g/s320/linda.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Brescia notes &#8220;several possible explanations for the potential connection between rising income inequality and the great strains on the economy it causes.  Did rising income for certain sectors lead to an ability to use that income to influence po,icymaking in such a way that favored those sectors?  Did such income inequality pressure politicians to promote policies that favored easy access to credit as a way to mollify lower income constituents who might otherwise grow frustrated with their own stagnating wages in the face of such inequality?&#8221;  He offers a third explanation&#8211;&#8220;that both income inequality and racial inequality created greater social distance and this social distance, in turn, led to greater predatory conduct&#8230; that turned a mortgage market into an economic killing field.&#8221;  The abstract further notes critical insights from looking at the crisis from the perspective of inequality data.</p>
<p>     1) the greater the income inequality in a state, on average, the greater the delinquency rate in that state.<br />     2) the greater the generalized trust in a state, the lower that state&#8217;s delinquency rate<br />     3) the higher the social capital in a state, and the higher the level of volunteerism in a state, the lower its delinquency rate<br />     4) the higher the median income in a state, the higher the delinquencyrate in that state<br />     5) an index of indicators&#8211;income inequality within a state, the size of the African-American population in a state and the median income of the African-American population in that state&#8211;reveals a strong correlation between these indicators and delinquency rates&#8230;[suggesting that] middle-class Afircan-Americans were targeted for, and steered towards, loans on unfair terms, precipitating the foreclosures that are now concentrated disproportionately in communities of color.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t the time to check it out, but here is a note and link to a Senate bill on offshoring:</p>
<p>The Senate is scheduled to vote TODAY on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-3816">Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act (S. 3816)</a> to set a time limit for debate and cut off a filibuster. </p>
<p>The bill has three main components:</p>
<blockquote><p>To encourage businesses to create jobs in the United States, it provides businesses with relief from the employer share of the Social Security payroll tax on wages paid to new U.S. employees performing services in the United States. To be eligible, businesses must certify that the U.S. employee is replacing an employee who had been performing similar duties overseas. </p>
<p>The bill eliminates subsidies U.S. taxpayers provide to firms that move facilities offshore by prohibiting a firm from taking any deduction, loss or credit for amounts paid in connection with reducing or ending the operation of a trade or business in the United States and starting or expanding a similar trade or business overseas. </p>
<p>It also ends the federal tax subsidy that rewards U.S. firms that move their production overseas. Under current law, U.S. companies can defer paying U.S. tax on income earned by their foreign subsidiaries until that income is brought back to the United States. This is known as “deferral.” Deferral has the effect of putting these firms at a competitive advantage over U.S. firms that hire U.S. workers to make products in the United States.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Japan are considering further quantitative easing. It&#8217;s an explicit statement, as with the <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100921a.htm">Federal Reserve</a> and the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/bank%20of%20england">Bank of England</a>, or implied by the fact that the foreign exchange intervention will <a href="http://www.boj.or.jp/en/type/stat/boj_stat/ecabs.pdf">eventually be sterilized</a> if the policy rule is not changed, as with the Bank of Japan. Why more easing?</p>
<p>In response to this question, <a href="http://www.bcaresearch.com/">BCA Research</a> (article not available) presented a version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money">quantity theory of money</a>. They looked at the simple linear relationship between the average rate of money supply growth (M2) and nominal GDP growth (P*Y).</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TKBqXdELa4I/AAAAAAAADQs/-2K21Itl7qc/s1600/us_money.png"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TKBqXdELa4I/AAAAAAAADQs/-2K21Itl7qc/s400/us_money.png"></a>The chart is a reproduction of that in the BCA paper, but with a sample back to 1959 (they went back to the 1920&#8217;s when M2 was not measured). The relationship illustrates the 5-yr compounded annual growth rate of money (M2) against that of nominal GDP, and has an R2 equal to 50% &#8211; okay, but not perfect.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Nevertheless, the implication is pretty simple: the current annual growth rate of M2, <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/">2.8%</a> in August 2010, corresponds to an average annual income growth just shy of 4%. Sitting beneath a behemoth pile of debt relative to income, 4% nominal GDP growth is unlikely provide sufficient nominal gains for households to deleverage quickly or &#8220;<a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/04/reducing-household-financial-leverage.html">safely</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>However, notice the 2000-2005 and 2005-2009 points, where the relationship between M2 and nominal GDP growth deviated away from the average &#8220;quantity theory&#8221; relationship. Would a broader measure of money account for the weak(ish) relationship in the chart above? Yes, partially. (Note: the relationship almost fully breaks down at an annual frequency.)</p>
<p>These days it&#8217;s all about credit. I&#8217;m sitting in Cosi right now &#8211; bought a sandwich and charged the bill on my credit card. Actually, I prefer to use cards. But M2 doesn&#8217;t account for this transaction as money if the balance is never paid in full. M2 is essentially currency, checking deposits, saving and small-denomination time deposits, and readily available retail money-market funds (see <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/">Federal Reserve release</a>).</p>
<p>One can argue about the merits of including credit cards balances as &#8220;money&#8221;, per se. However, the sharp reversal of <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/Current/">revolving consumer credit,</a> and likely through default (see the <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/releases/chargeoff/chgallsa.htm">still growing chargeoff rates for credit card loans</a>), would never be captured in M2. The hangover from the last decade of households using their homes as ATM&#8217;s (i.e., home equity withdrawal) and running up credit card balances to serve as a medium of exchange is dragging nominal income growth via a sharp drop in aggregate demand.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve discontinued its release of <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/discm3.htm">M3 in 2006</a>, which among other things included bank repurchase agreements (repos). Including M3, rather than M2, in the estimation improves the the R2 over 30 percentage points (to 81%).</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TKEnPojr3bI/AAAAAAAADQ0/Czgm7rvD9es/s1600/m3money_ngdp.png"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TKEnPojr3bI/AAAAAAAADQ0/Czgm7rvD9es/s400/m3money_ngdp.png"></a><br />This is a very small sample, and removing the latest data point from the original estimation improves the R2 slightly to 64%; but clearly there&#8217;s something going on here. I think that it&#8217;s fair to say that we may be disappointed by the M2 implied average nominal GDP growth rate over the next 5 years (4%).</p>
<p>According to John Williams&#8217; Shadow Statistics website, <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/money-supply-charts">M3 is still contracting</a> at (roughly because I don&#8217;t subscribe to the data) 4% over the year. The relationship in the second chart implies that nominal GDP will fall, on average, about 4.5% per year. <a href="http://www.esri.cao.go.jp/en/sna/h20-kaku/22annual-report-e.html">Japan&#8217;s nominal GDP never contracted more than 2.08%</a> annually during its lost decade, but the implication is that &#8220;things&#8221; may not be as rosy as the M2 measure of money suggests.</p>

<p>The New York Times asked me for my views of Robert Samuelson&#8217;s recent argument in the Washington Post that extending the tax cuts for the wealthy made sense because they would otherwise cut back their spending, tax cuts for them will create jobs (770,000, he claims) and not extending the tax cuts would raise taxes on &#8220;small&#8221; businesses and thus &#8220;discourage hiring and expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The discussion appears in the<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/09/27/tax-cuts-the-trickle-down-argument">New York Times &#8220;Room for Debate&#8221;</a> forum on the trickle down argument, at Hey Big Spenders: The Trickle-Down Argument, Sept. 27, 2010.</p>
<p>Here at ataxingmatter I&#8217;ll add some introductory context, which is somewhat harsher on Samuelson and his claim to question &#8220;the ritual of sound-bite economics&#8221; than the short form posted at the New York Times.</p>
<blockquote><p>Robert Samuelson claims to sound a voice of reason, but he is merely part of an increasing cacophony of ideological extremism.</p>
<p> He starts with a distorted sound-bite—that “the left sees salvation only in ever-larger government … [that] threatens long-term economic growth through higher taxes, regulations or budget deficits.”  I&#8217;d say rather that the left questions the right’s theories behind expanding government intrusions on individual rights and bloating government warmongering rather than relying on the likely more successful and certainly less costly art of diplomacy.  On the other hand, the right pushes for deregulation no matter the record of negligence and active harm caused by reliance on so-called industry self-regulation or the harm that ensues from inadequate prudential behavior, which we so amply witnessed in the financial meltdown and broader economic crisis of the Great Recession.  Similarly, the right is schizophrenic on budget deficits—favoring them to provide tax cuts for mega-corporations and wealthy Americans who can amply manage without them, but bemoaning even uncertain future deficits from programs benefitting ordinary Americans, such as Social Security.</p>
<p> Samuelson then attacks Obama as “subvert[ing] confidence” because he “fights Wall Street bankers, oil companies, multinational firms, health insurers and others.”  These titans of commerce began the fight when they retained all productivity growth for their owners and managers at the expense of ordinary Americans.  Health insurers benefited by denying coverage, or delaying payment.  Multinationals drained the federal fisc through transfer pricing games, tax credit manipulation and other tax shelters.  Oil companies polluted waters and fisheries to save a few bucks on safer deep sea drilling and companies continue in their efforts to stymy legislative action to regulate questionable fracturing procedures to extract natural gas from shale.  Wall Street bankers profited immensely from speculation in a casino financial system with interconnected and layered risks at the expense of the non-financial heart of the economy.</p>
<p>Then Samuelson spouts the worn arguments from Reaganomics for letting the rich avoid a fair share of the tax burden, even while they garner an ever increasing share of the nation’s wealth.

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/business/27ratings.html?pagewanted=1&#038;hp">D. Keith Johnson, a former president of Clayton Holdings, a company that analyzed mortgage pools for the Wall Street firms that sold them, told the [financial crisis inquiry] commission on Thursday that almost half the mortgages Clayton sampled from the beginning of 2006 through June 2007 failed to meet crucial quality benchmarks that banks had promised to investors. </p>
<p>[skip]</p>
<p>“We went to the ratings agencies and said, ‘Wouldn’t this information be great for you to have as you assign tranche levels of risk?’ ” Mr. Johnson testified last week. But none of the agencies took him up on his offer, he said, indicating that it was against their business interests to be too critical of Wall Street. </p>
<p>“If any one of them would have adopted it,” he testified, “they would have lost market share.” <br /></a></p>
<p>The investment banks who paid Clayton Holdings for the analysis used it to get the mortgages for a low price but didn&#8217;t share the data with investors.  Both the investment banks and the ratings agencies defend themselves noting vague statements about declining underwriting standards in prospectuses and &#8220;research and commentary&#8221; respectively.  </p>
<p>Clearly the vagueness was deliberate &#8220;some loans in the pool don&#8217;t meet the declared standards&#8221; is no briefer and less informative than &#8220;most loans in the pool don&#8217;t meet the declared standards.&#8221;  It is almost as clear that no one will pay penalties proportional to the direct harm to investors (let alone the indirect costs of the crisis).  Morgan Stanley executives settled out of court with the State of Massachusetts for $102 million &#8212; and laughed all the way back to their bank.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going long pitchforks.</p>

<p><strong>Unemployment Rates, an International Apples to Apples Comparison</strong></p>
<p>Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=179">the Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>One of the things we all know about America is that labor laws are more flexible here than in other developed countries, so we have lower unemployment rates than in other countries with relatively more rigid labor laws.  Its one of those facts we are told over and over again, like cutting taxes spurs economic growth or that the folks benefiting the most from our largess in Iraq and Afghanistan, not to say an assortment of tin pot dictators throughout Central Asia, are pro-democracy and pro-America.  </p>
<p>A lesser known fact is that unemployment rates are computed differently from country to country.  (So is GDP, but that&#8217;s a topic for another post.)  The Bureau of Labor Statistics, the folks who compute the unemployment rates here in the land of the (relatively) free market went through the effort of <a href="http://www.bls.gov/fls/flscomparelf/unemployment.htm#how_is_unemployment_measured">adjusting the unemployment rates of the US and nine other countries</a> (Canada, Australia, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK) between to allow for an apples to apples comparison.  I think the most interesting data &#8211; the comparison of overall unemployment rates from 1970 to 2009 &#8211; is in table 1-2, which I&#8217;ve imported into Excel and graphed below.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TJ-O8GLgagI/AAAAAAAAAZY/kvbecbLsCfM/s1600/unemployment1.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TJ-O8GLgagI/AAAAAAAAAZY/kvbecbLsCfM/s320/unemployment1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 1.</p>
<p>The chart is a bit busy, but hopefully you could tell what&#8217;s going on if you look closely.  And what I see is this&#8230; <br /><a name="more"></a><br />For most of the sample, one or two countries produced, hands down, the best outcomes in the sample.  For the entire sample, Japan is always one of those countries, but the other front-runner changes mid-sample.  Sweden (yes, &#8220;socialist&#8221; Sweden) was the other in the period from 1970 to 1990, and the Netherlands (yes, &#8220;socialist&#8221; Holland) becomes the usual leader of the pack starting in the late 90s.  Japan, of course, like Sweden and the Netherlands, is not exactly well-known for its flexible labor laws.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know enough to say what happened in Holland and/or Sweden but I have a hard time concluding that in their respective heydays they were a libertarian paradise.  </p>
<p>As to the US&#8230; frankly, it did pretty lousy relative to the others from 1970 to about 1982, whereupon it began improving, eventually getting the point of contending for the top spot in the peloton.  The US had a brief shining moment in the Sun &#8211; producing the second or third best performance from 1993 to 2000&#8230; but its been downhill from there.  Put another way&#8230;  things started going downhill, relatively, for US unemployment when the country began benefiting (ahem) from the most free market administration in the sample.</p>
<p>What I don&#8217;t see in the graph is any sign that the US approach to the labor markets can be described as the best, or even in the top three or four in this sample, assuming the goal is to keep unemployment down.</p>
