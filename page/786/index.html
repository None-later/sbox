                                <p><a href="http://media.www.fsunews.com/media/storage/paper920/news/2007/04/09/News/Lecture.Discusses.Slavery.In.2007-2828849-page2.shtml">Local slaves from Mexico, Russia, and&#8230;</a></p>
<blockquote><p>(At the lecture) Coonan also said that it&#8217;s happening within the Chinese community as well, with traffickers promising young women a better life in America. According to Coonan, in nearby<strong> Quincy</strong>, a Chinese restaurant has Hispanic women working there and living in a small shed behind the restaurant. Many of these restaurants also have their employees living in the kitchen after hours as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the most shocking thing is that everything is close to home,&#8221; said Danielle May, who attended the lecture. &#8220;This is not something that you see on the international news being in Cambodia, or Thailand. This issue is happening at home. I think it&#8217;s scary. Quincy is 45 minutes away and people are being enslaved. This is shocking that this is 2007 and slavery is still going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the lecture, countries lose U.S. aid if they do not enforce trafficking laws. <strong>The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000</strong>, stipulates that if a victim testifies on being trafficked, they receive a Traffic Visa (T-Visa), which allows them permission to work in the U.S. for about three years and then they are eligible to apply for a green card.<br />Most Americans are stunned to find slavery still exists in the United States, let alone the rest of the world. Unlike the state-sanctioned, race-based crime of the past, modern-day slavery is largely an illegal, global phenomenon, fueled primarily by commercial gain.</p>
<p>Some are slaves in factories and farms. Others-primarily women and girls-are slaves in brothels in Mumbai, Amsterdam or Las Vegas. Still others are held in domestic servitude. Children are kidnapped as child soldiers, forced to become street beggars, or lured and abused as slaves to an underground industry known as child sex tourism.</p>
<p>Government alone can&#8217;t stop the international slave trade. That&#8217;s why a coalition of private citizens, nonprofit organizations and civic leaders are nurturing and leading a 21st century abolitionist movement by spotlighting the issue, increasing public awareness, pushing countries to do more, and producing programs to help throw the traffickers in jail and protect the survivors.</p>
<p>We are beginning to understand the tricks of today&#8217;s human traffickers, which are the same tactics as those used by the slave masters of old: deception, fraud, coercion, kidnapping, beatings and rape.</p>
<p>Victims obtained from a foreign country are often lured by deceptive schemes. They usually arrive indebted to their handlers, seldom know where they are, rarely speak the local language and have no one to turn to after the traffickers seize their passports and documentation.</p>
<p>Under the control of the traffickers, victims are subjected to overwhelming physical and mental pressures. Confined by beatings and threats against their families back home, trafficking victims surrender their dignity to poor living conditions and long hours in order to enrich their captors.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Trafficking victims-whether from across the ocean or the street-learn to trust no one, not even the police. Coerced to cooperate, trafficking victims become skilled at hiding in plain sight, disguising their shame from society, ever wary of discovery and fearful of retribution.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a movement afoot. It asks each of us to be responsible, find out what is happening, pay attention to the signals, and insist on nothing less than abolition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2007/82809.htm">Categories of slavery</a> are listed by the Department of State.</p>
<p>1-888-373-7888 is a number to call to ask for advice and report concerns:scared, foreign, unable to leave premises, demeanor is not natural might indicate employment is not voluntary.</p>
<p>Funding for a two year study of and help for slaves in the US under the <em>The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000</em> was won in 2003 in the area and then not renewed.  Grants are notoriously fleeting.</p>
<p>The idea that there are 100,000 actual &#8216;domestic servitude&#8217; slaves in the US is so stunning for most of us that in my opinion it simply slips away in denial rather than outrage, even for me.</p>
<p>Aside from the psychological aspects of slavery, 90% in one study of &#8216;freed slaves&#8217; report that sending money home (meaning most of the money) was more important, as the perception was the money sent was needed to help avoid catastrophe at the slaves&#8217; home of origin, or local traffickers would harm family that remained behind if trouble was caused.  Powerful forces indeed.</p>

                                <p>I have intentionally let others post about the politics of this war wanting to keep the focus on economics as that is what attracts me to this blog. BUT&#8230;for all the postings here that have resulted in supportive comments for the war, please explain <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7Ik_X1HU0&#038;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crooksandliars.com%2F">this</a>.</p>
<p>Dick Cheney at the Economic Club of Detroit in 1992 (2 years earlier than the 94 Cheney). Note that Cheney refers to the objectives and achieving them. Note the mention that going in would have resulted in the “disintegration of the Arab coalition”. “The world was with us” was not a post 9/11 phenomenon. It was who we always were.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It&#8217;s not the kind of situation where you could pull up in front of the presidential palace and say common Saddam you&#8217;re going to the slammer.” </p>
<p>“For the 146 Americans who were killed in action and for their families it was not a cheap or a low cost conflict.”</p>

<p>I new when Bush was first running he wanted a war. It was in what he was saying.  My sweety and I wonder how those supporting him could not see this assuming a reasonable person would not want a war talking president when there was no war potential in sight.</p>
<p>So please (I&#8217;m being polite here) tell me how this current war was undertaken for my benefit?  Before you hit that comment button, read this <a href="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003646639">too</a>.</p>

                                <p>GREENSPAN</p>
<p>There was a discussion of Greenspan as a Fed Chairman earlier today.
<p></p>
</p>
<p>Different people were making various claims with no evidence to support their positions.
<p></p>
</p>
<p>So I though I would put in my two cents worth, but provide a chart to show why I take the position on Greenspan I do.
<p></p>
</p>
<p>The first chart is my Fed Policy index.  It is my version of the <city st="on"><place st="on">Taylor</place></city> rule, but the biggest<br />difference between my version and other versions is that this one gives inflation and<br />unemployment equal weights.  Most <city st="on"><place st="on">Taylor</place></city> rule approaches gives inflation a weight of some 2 to 3 times economic slack.  The others use the GDP Gap rather then the unemployment rate, but the difference is not significant. Moreover,  the GDP Gap is a quarterly series iso t is not available as quickly.  This chart uses smoothed monthly data and on an unsmoothed basis the index is now at 4.8%. Other  <city st="on"><place st="on">Taylor</place></city> rule approaches generally says rates should have been higher in the pre-Volcker era and about the same in the Volcker era then they actually were.</p>

<p>This version says that Greenspan started office by tightening more then was necessary as in the late 1980s actual funds were higher then the rule implies they should have been.  This obviously contributed to the 1990 recession.</p>
<p>But the index implies that through the 1990s Fed Policy was almost exactly what the index called for.  In other words we could have programmed a computer to give us almost exactly the same policy that Greenspan actually produced.  Maybe the more interesting question is, if Greenspan followed the same policy rules as pre-Volker Chairmen had, why did it generate such different results.  This clearly implies that K Harris is correct to think that much of what Greenspan achieved was strictly a matter of luck.  Or maybe it was the lagged impact of the unusual tightly policies Volcker implemented. But again in the early 1990s actual policy deviated from the policy index as policy was significantly more expansionary then the index implied it should have been.  We are still not certain if that was the best policy.</p>

<p>In this chart I simply did a regression of actual funds against the index and a dummy variable for Volcker.  It is just another way of showing that through the 1990s Greenspan<br />did almost exactly what my policy rule called for.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.blogger.com/%3Ca">This NYT article</a> reports on new structuring of ownership of nursing home chains by private equity funds.</p>
<blockquote><p>Habana is one of thousands of nursing homes across the nation that large Wall Street investment companies have bought or agreed to acquire in recent years.<br />Those investors include prominent private equity firms like Warburg Pincus and the Carlyle Group, better known for buying companies like Dunkin’ Donuts.<br />As such investors have acquired nursing homes, they have often reduced costs, increased profits and quickly resold facilities for significant gains.<br />But by many regulatory benchmarks, residents at those nursing homes are worse off, on average, than they were under previous owners, according to an analysis by The New York Times of data collected by government agencies from 2000 to 2006.<br />&#8230;<br />For instance, Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration has named Habana and 34 other homes owned by Formation and operated by affiliates of Warburg Pincus as among the state’s worst in categories like “<a title="In-depth reference and news articles about Diet and Nutrition." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/food-guide-pyramid/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">nutrition</a> and hydration,” “restraints and abuse” and “quality of care.” Those homes have been individually cited for violations of safety codes, but there have been no chainwide investigations or fines, because regulators were unaware that all the facilities were owned and operated by a common group, said Molly McKinstry, bureau chief for long-term-care services at Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration.<br />And even when regulators do issue fines to investor-owned homes, they have found penalties difficult to collect.<br />“These companies leave the nursing home licensee with no assets, and so there is nothing to take,” said Scott Johnson, special assistant attorney general of Mississippi.<br />Government authorities are also frequently unaware when nursing homes pay large fees to affiliates.<br />For example, Habana, operated by a Warburg Pincus affiliate, paid other Warburg Pincus affiliates an estimated $558,000 for management advice and other services last year, according to reports the home filed.<br />Government programs require nursing homes to reveal when they pay affiliates so that such disbursements can be scrutinized to make sure they are not artificially inflated.<br />&#8230;<br />However, advocates for nursing home reforms say investors exaggerate the industry’s precariousness. Last year, Formation sold Habana and 185 other facilities to <a title="More information about General Electric Company" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/general_electric_company/index.html?inline=nyt-org">General Electric</a> for $1.4 billion. A prominent nursing home industry analyst, Steve Monroe, estimates that Formation’s and its co-investors’ gains from that sale were more than $500 million in just four years. Formation declined to comment on that figure.</p></blockquote>
<p>One nursing home had 22 companies/affiliates with its operation. The intent is to make the nursing home licensee asset poor, and skim off cash flow at probably 20% (MY GUESS) return since this is the favored &#8216;new economy&#8217; rate.</p>
<p>Clients and regulators cannot sort out who does what for and to whom. Seems to be the way ownership of mortgages was divided into 3 or 4 different bundles that constricted any reasonable response by companies to the mortgage hullaboo.</p>
<p>I still have a primitive need to know where to throw my bricks in times of a company needing to take responsibility. Hopefully we can find a better way to spend all this sloshing around liquidity. Reminds me of a financial laundry at the moment.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post is quick and dirty&#8230; I&#8217;m in a hurry and don&#8217;t have time to give it adequate time.  I want to look at the change in real GDP per capita and how its related to the Fed&#8217;s behavior.  </p>
<p>First, a look at the annual percentage change in real GDP per capita.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rvud57L0VQI/AAAAAAAAAuo/odLlrnKSg9o/s1600-h/yearly+percentage+change+in+real+GDP+per+capita.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rvud57L0VQI/AAAAAAAAAuo/odLlrnKSg9o/s320/yearly+percentage+change+in+real+GDP+per+capita.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Data on real GDP per capita comes from <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/www.bea.gov">the BEA&#8217;s NIPA table 7.1</a>.)  What this shows is that earlier in the sample, growth rates could be higher, but there was more, well, bounciness in the data.  </p>
<p>This next graph overlays the annual percentage change in real M2 per capita.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rvud1LL0VPI/AAAAAAAAAug/zc3drlzdTno/s1600-h/yearly+percentage+change+in+real+GDP+per+capita+and+real+M2+per+capita.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rvud1LL0VPI/AAAAAAAAAug/zc3drlzdTno/s320/yearly+percentage+change+in+real+GDP+per+capita+and+real+M2+per+capita.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(M2 is available from <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/hist/h6hist1.txt">the Fed</a>, and I picked figures for January of each year for this graph.  Sadly, the data is not avilable going back to 1953.  I also used population figures for Q1 of the year from BEA NIPA table 7.1, and derived inflation from the <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI</a>.</p>
<p>The graph kinda looks like the series move together.  But does one lead the other?  Yes?  No?  And if so, which?</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be a bit more precise.  I computed the real M2 per capita for each quarter since the data became available &#8211; for Q1 figures, I used March, for Q2 I used June, etc.  The table below shows two sets of correlations &#8211; between quarterly real M2 per capita and quarterly real GDP per capita, and between the percentage change in quarter to quarter quarterly real M2 per capita and the percentage change from quarter to quarter in quarterly real GDP per capita&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rvudv7L0VOI/AAAAAAAAAuY/S4ztklXUoIw/s1600-h/correlations+between+real+gdp+per+capita+and+real+m2+per+capita.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rvudv7L0VOI/AAAAAAAAAuY/S4ztklXUoIw/s320/correlations+between+real+gdp+per+capita+and+real+m2+per+capita.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>What does this show?  Well&#8230;  <br />1.  The correlation between real GDP per capita and real M2 per capita is pretty high at 90%.<br />2.  If either series leads, it seems real M2 per capita leads real GDP per capita, and by two quarters.  (Look at the correlation of the growth rate of the two series.. the highest correlation is between the % change in real M2 per capita lagged by two quarters and the % change in real GDP per capita.)</p>
<p>Put another way&#8230; the Fed moves first, real GDP follows.  Now perhaps the Fed is reacting to leading indicators&#8230; but how leading?  By 6 months?  Seriously?</p>
<p>So&#8230; we clearly, the Fed&#8217;s actions help move the economy.</p>
<p>Now a final question&#8230; which Presidents have been helped by the Fed, and which have been harmed by the Fed?  The table below shows the annualized percentage change in real M2 per capita over the terms of each President going back to 1960.  </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RwLh_LL0VVI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/IqQKSeHFmMY/s1600-h/Figure+8.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RwLh_LL0VVI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/IqQKSeHFmMY/s320/Figure+8.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Note&#8230; the original version of this table had erroneous figures for JFK/LBJ, making real M2 per capita look higher for them.  Apologies.)</p>
<p>Basically, if the Fed is a cheerleader, its on the side of the Reps.  GHW got hosed, but he&#8217;s the only one who did among the Reps.  JFK/LBJ got a boost from the Fed, but they&#8217;re the only ones who did among Dems.  All in all, Reps were the beneficiaries of Fed actions&#8230; Dems not so much.  Which makes it even more puzzling why growth rates tended to be higher among Dems than Reps.  Policy anyone?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Massive correction!!!!  I entered the wrong data into the last graph.  Results were way off.  Correct now!!!  (I realized as I was headed out the door that the data didn&#8217;t match what I had seen when I did this kind of thing before.  Apologies.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Additional note&#8230; the annualized percentage change in real M2 per capita is based on January to January figures.</p>
<p>Another thought&#8230;  why did GHW get such short shrift from Uncle Alan?  A few ideas&#8230;  maybe if real MS per cap continued to increase at the same rate as under Reagan (i.e., it was overdone on Reagan), it would eventually translate to inflation, or maybe because GHW wasn&#8217;t a believer, what with the whole &#8220;Voodoo Economics&#8221; thing.   Probably a combination of the two.  But it does indicate that perhaps whoever follows GW might be in a bit of trouble.</p>
<p>Also, to be crude, it seems to me that Clinton wasn&#8217;t the only to get, well, Lewinsky-ed in the Oval Office.  Its just that GW and Reagan got their Lewinsky from Alan Greenspan.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve said it before, I&#8217;ll say it again&#8230; one of the worse things this administration has done has been to make a lot of data unreliable.  But then, the easiest way to lie with statistics is to mess with the underlying data.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.blogger.com/%3Ca%20title=">Malaysia unpegs the ringgit from the US dollar</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The bank said the current valuation of the ringgit is consistent with the country&#8217;s economic fundamentals and takes into consideration &#8220;developments in our trading partner countries&#8221; &#8212; an apparent reference to China.Malaysian had insisted previously that it is not working with China on changes to their currency exchange rates, although it had indicated it may be prepared to take action if China moves on its yuan.&#8221;Changes in the international and regional financial and economic environment have made it important for Malaysia to have a stable exchange rate against its major trading partners, in particular, the regional countries,&#8221; it said.Consequently, the stability of the ringgit exchange rate against the regional currencies will become increasingly important, and stability can best be achieved by maintaining the value of the ringgit against a trade-weighted index of Malaysia&#8217;s major trading partners, it said.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.emiratesbank.ae/ebg/resourcecenter/insights/">The Emirate&#8217;s Bank anouncement</a> suggests that even though Kuwait unpegged from the US dollar, what is stopping other countries in the area from unpegging their currencies is only the high price of oil. High inflation is taking a toll. The central banking aspect as well is only a portion of the money in play, with significant amounts of money not in view:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Sometimes, for currency anchors, there is a price to pay – mainly during times when the currency is tied to a weaker currency that gets eroded in the market place. But when the peg is to a robust currency with momentary correction, is the choice of most central banks of the world, is the currency of the world&#8217;s largest economy and as yet, the dominant one, then any debate on chopping or changing is perhaps premature and would have to be dealt with, not at the currency level but on the basis of overall trade-weighted export pricing and other geo-political considerations.</p></blockquote>
<p>While these are only a few examples, it does appear that China&#8217;s trading partners will follow their lead, and the ME oil producing nations are being squeezed to do the same unpegging eventually. If oil prices fall, the pressure to unpeg increases.</p>
<p>I wonder what other currencies are in play.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the constants of the global economy has been companies moving tasks &#8211; and jobs &#8211; to India, where they could be done at lower cost. But rising wages for programmers here, a strengthening currency and companies&#8217; need for workers in their clients&#8217; time zones or for workers who speak languages other than English are challenging that model.<br />At the same time, India is facing increased competition from countries seeking to emulate its success as a back office for wealthier neighbors: China for Japan, Morocco for France and Mexico for the United States, for instance.<br />Looking to beat back these new rivals, leading Indian companies are opening back offices in those countries, outsourcing work to them before their current clients do.<br />Many executives in India now concede that outsourcing, having rained most heavily on India, will increasingly sprinkle tasks across the planet. The future of outsourcing, said Ashok Vemuri, an Infosys senior vice president, is &#8220;to take the work from any part of the world and do it in any part of the world.&#8221;<br />In May, Infosys&#8217;s Indian rival, Tata Consultancy Services, announced a new back office in Guadalajara, Mexico; it already has 5,000 staffers in Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. Cognizant Technology Solutions, with most of its operations in India, has now opened back offices in Phoenix, Arizona, and in Shanghai. Wipro, another Indian company, has outsourcing offices in Canada, China, Portugal, Romania and Saudi Arabia, among other locations.<br />Last month, Wipro said it was opening a software development center in Atlanta that would hire 500 programmers in three years.<br />In a poetic reflection of the new face of outsourcing, Wipro&#8217;s chairman, Azim Premji, told Wall Street analysts this year that he was considering hubs in Idaho and Virginia, in addition to Georgia, to take advantage of &#8220;states which are less developed,&#8221; Premji said.<br />Infosys is building an archipelago of back offices &#8211; in Mexico, the Czech Republic, Thailand and China, as well as in low-cost regions of the United States. The company wants to become a global matchmaker: Any time a company wants work done somewhere else, even just down the street, Infosys hopes to get the call.<br />&#8230;<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s the equivalent of a bachelor&#8217;s in computer science in six months,&#8221; said a trainee, Melissa Adams, 22. Adams graduated last spring from the University of Washington with a business degree and turned down Google for Infosys.<br />Still, even as outsourcing moves in new directions, old perceptions linger.<br />When Jeff Rand, 23, another American trainee, told his grandmother, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be moving to India and working as a software engineer for the next six months, she said, &#8216;Maybe I&#8217;ll get to talk to you when I have a problem with my credit card.&#8217; &#8220;<br />&#8220;It took me about two or three weeks to explain to my grandma that I was not going to be working in a call center,&#8221; Rand said with a rueful chuckle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The value of cultural affinities and language are being put into the mix as companies compete through both WTO GATS and other agreements. Multi-lateral trade agreements and such are increasing as Doha negotiations have ground to a stop.   The same trend is being played out in Europe as US firms (finance, banks, lawyers) expand into that market.
</p>
<p>I believe the trend in countries cooperating in regional trading partner policies, for example the responses to de-pegging or considering de-pegging national currencies from the US dollar, will accelerate the process.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/">Bill Polley</a> sent me some e-mail, and we&#8217;ve been having a bit of an exchange.  I want to focus on what I think is an important point he made that has not been discussed on Angry Bear.  He suggested (I hope I&#8217;m not mischaracterizing his point) that my measure of growth:  growth in real (GDP per capita less change in debt) per capita may be misleading, and in fact, any measure with debt in it would be misleading.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the idea&#8230;  say you&#8217;re you have a pre-existing national debt &#8211; which has been <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-national-debt.html">true for every President in our series</a>.  Now, say a President takes office when inflation is low, but leaves with high inflation.  There will be a few effects of that:</p>
<p>1.  The real value of each bond will shrink as it is inflated away&#8230;  thus, much of the debt is inflated away.  (If the dollar loses half of its value, a bond worth $50 (2000 base year) is worth $25 (2000 base year) a few years later.)<br />2.  The real cost of the interest on each bond will be inflated away.</p>
<p>Thus, Presidents who started with low inflation and ended with high inflation &#8211; and if you look at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-inflation-and-real.html">this graph</a> both Nixon and Carter qualify, will benefit.  Similarly, those under whom inflation fell, think Reagan and to a lesser extent GW, will be penalized &#8211; they will be stuck with a lot of debt that was obtained cheaply but now costs dearly.</p>
<p>Actually, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-inflation-and-real.html">this post</a> also shows real interest rates.  Reagan may well have been penalized&#8230; (To a lesser extent, GHW and Clinton would also have been stuck with some of those bonds)  GW&#8230; actually probably benefited, given the interest rates were negative throughout much of his term.  They were also (very) negative for the last few years of the Nixon/Ford administration.</p>
<p>So how does one take these factors into account in a fair way?  Is it even possible?  I don&#8217;t know &#8211; especially since these aren&#8217;t the only factors that matter.  We know <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_19.html">Real M1 per capita correlates with growth</a> &#8211; and the big beneficiaries for that were JFK/LBJ, Reagan, and GW.  How do we take that into account?</p>
<p>My guess &#8211; its not entirely possible.  We can conclude that Reagan got hosed by one measure, and made off very well by another.  The same is true of Carter (look what happened to real M1 per capita in his term!).  And GW seems to have benefited many different ways by Fed actions (it pays to play hardball, apparently) and still hasn&#8217;t done all that well.  </p>
<p>But is there one fair measure?  I don&#8217;t know. In the end, there is some luck out there&#8230;</p>
