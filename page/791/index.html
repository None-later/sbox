</p>
<p>Productivity growth is clearly slowing, and the key question is, is this a purely cyclical development or is it signaling a slowing in the long term trend growth rate.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Ru58LMHuONI/AAAAAAAAAAc/_ESHDsDyITA/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Ru58LMHuONI/AAAAAAAAAAc/_ESHDsDyITA/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Slowing productivity is a normal cyclical development and it is such a strong pattern, that historically, it has been a very good leading indicator.  But this implies that we can not really determine if the recent slowing is just cyclical weakness or a trend shift.</p>
</p>
<p>To answer this question we need to look at indicators that either lead or determine productivity growth.  It is a question economists have been researching for years </p>
<p>But clearly a major factor in productivity growth is the real capital stock per worker and it is generally widely accepted that this accounts for a quarter to half of productivity growth.  Moreover, it also leads productivity growth by about a year.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There is also a long term relationship between trend productivity growth and trend growth in the real capital stock per workers as the following chart demonstrates.</p>

<p>From WW II until the late 1970s, early 1980s there was a very strong and relatively stable trend growth rate for both productivity and real capital stock per employee.  But in the 1980s economic cycle growth in the real capital stock per employee stagnated, as it was still the same in 1990 as it had been in 1982.  There was a cyclical bump in the early 1990s but this was driven more by a drop in employment then by stronger investment.  With the capital spending boom of the late 1990s growth in productivity and the capital stock per employee surged again. But in recent years growth has stagnated again as since the Bush tax cut it has failed to grow.</p>
</p>
<p>This data on growth in the real capital stock per employee strongly implies that the recent slowing in productivity growth is not just a cyclical slowdown.  Rather it looks like a shift to a slower growth trend driven by weak capital spending.</p>
<p>Obviously, given the limitations of blogging I can not get into much of a discussion of why growth in the real capital stock per employee did not grow in the 1980s or in recent years.  However, these results are exactly the opposite of what the advocates of supply-side economics or republican trickle-down policies have promised.  Maybe the simple answer is that there is no significant relationship between tax policy and capital spending.</p>
<p>  But on the other hand since WW II the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">US</place></country-region> has experienced good growth in the capital stock per employee except in the years when supply side economic policies were in place.   I’ll leave it to the advocates of such policy to explain these discrepancies. However, I believe this is the fundamental or core reason why Cactus keeps finding that the economy does better under democrats than under republicans</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.gallupworldpoll.com/content/?ci=28678">This analysis of Gallup Poll</a> data offers insights for us to seriously think about. It also fits in with <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/">John Robb&#8217;s expert theory</a> on terrorisms.</p>
<blockquote><p>Often U.S. policy-makers and other intellectuals draw an analogy between the Cold War and the current &#8220;global war on terror&#8221; and recommend analogous strategies, because, after all, both conflicts battled over people&#8217;s hearts and minds. But results from Gallup&#8217;s surveys in the Muslim world point to important differences between the two conflicts and real risks in confusing them by applying similar strategies.<br />At the heart of the Cold War analogy is the belief that religious fanaticism fuels extremism and therefore replacing Muslims&#8217; worldview with Western liberalism is the path to victory against terrorism. To begin to understand the danger of this diagnosis, we must first understand the factors that do and do not drive sympathy for violence.<br />As a starting point, Muslims do not hold a monopoly on extremist views. While 6% of Americans think attacks in which civilians are targets are &#8220;completely justified,&#8221; in both Lebanon and Iran, this figure is 2%, and in Saudi Arabia, it&#8217;s 4%. In Europe, Muslims in Paris and London were no more likely than were their counterparts in the general public to believe attacks on civilians are ever justified and at least as likely to reject violence, even for a &#8220;noble cause.&#8221;<br />After analyzing survey data representing more than 90% of the global Muslim population, Gallup found that despite widespread anti-American sentiment, only a small minority saw the 9/11 attacks as morally justified. Even more significant, there was no correlation between level of religiosity and extremism among respondents. Among the 7% of the population that fits in the politically radicalized category &#8212; those who saw the 9/11 attacks as completely justifiable and have an unfavorable view of the United States &#8212; 94% said religion is an important part of their daily lives, compared with 90% among those in the moderate majority. And no significant difference exists between radicals and moderates in mosque attendance.<br />Gallup probed respondents further and actually asked both those who condoned and condemned extremist acts why they said what they did. The responses fly in the face of conventional wisdom. For example, in Indonesia, the largest Muslim majority country in the world, many of those who condemned terrorism cited humanitarian or religious justifications to support their response. For example, one woman said, &#8220;Killing one life is as sinful as killing the whole world,&#8221; paraphrasing verse 5:32 in the Quran.<br />On the other hand, not a single respondent in Indonesia who condoned the attacks of 9/11 cited the Quran for justification. Instead, this group&#8217;s responses were markedly secular and worldly. For example, one Indonesian respondent said, &#8220;The U.S. government is too controlling toward other countries, seems like colonizing.&#8221;<br />The real difference between those who condone terrorist acts and all others is about politics, not piety. For example, the politically radicalized often cite &#8220;occupation and U.S. domination&#8221; as their greatest fear for their country and only a small minority of them agree the United States would allow people in the region to fashion their own political future or that it is serious about supporting democracy in the region. Also, among this group&#8217;s top responses was the view that to better relations with the Muslim world, the West should respect Islam and stop imposing its beliefs and policies. In contrast, moderates most often mentioned economic problems as their greatest fear for their country, and along with respecting Islam, they see economic support and investments as a way for the West to better relations. Moderates are also more likely than the politically radicalized to say the United States is serious about promoting democracy.<br />While the politically radicalized are as likely as the moderate majority to say better relations with the West is of personal concern to them, they are much less likely to believe the West reciprocates this concern and therefore much less likely to believe improved relations will ever come. In short, perceptions of being under siege characterize those who sympathize with extremism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several thoughts occur to me. I am also not an expert on these matters so I must rely on readings to try to figure out what is going on and what policy I can reasonably support.</p>
<p>1. I am averse to &#8216;global truths&#8217; because I have never found them adequate to explain human behaviors or produce accurate planning information.<br />2. History often shows the deficiency of such approaches after the fact, which I will not explore on this post. Such perceptions are used to confirm a priori beliefs instead of leading to questions to be solved. Perhaps this is a matter of temperament for some, or calculation for others.<br />3. In a speech, asking questions of nuance is very hum drum and has no punch or ring to it. Advertising needs catchy stimuli to work, so works on our limbic system the most dramatically. As a way to develop policy&#8230;not so good.</p>

<p>Frustrated by criticism from the United States over their slow progress towards political goals meant to foster national reconciliation, Iraqi leaders said Washington would be better served by examining its own progress in the unpopular war.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Americans always try to pretend the responsibility for cleaning up this mess isn&#8217;t theirs and tend to shift blame onto Iraq, Iran and Syria for everything that goes wrong,&#8221; said veteran Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a title="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/sebok/20070731.html" href="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/sebok/20070731.html">The Pinochio Law</a> carries the fiction of companies as persons to greater depth, finally.</p>
<blockquote><p>Last week, the British government agreed to introduce a new law titled the &#8220;Corporate Manslaughter Statute.&#8221; This law is remarkable because it attempts to make companies&#8211;not persons&#8211;criminally responsible for deaths caused by a firm&#8217;s gross negligence. In this column, I will examine the law&#8217;s structure, its history, and finally, I will ask how American law approaches the same problems the Corporate Manslaughter Act is designed to solve.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corporate Manslaughter Act<br /></strong>The British law allows the state to prosecute a corporation or partnership (an &#8220;organization&#8221; for short) for the crime of manslaughter if the organization causes the death of a person as the result of its &#8220;gross&#8221; breach of a duty owed under the law of negligence. However, in order for the state to prove its case, it must prove that a substantial element of the gross breach of duty resulted from the way in which the organization&#8217;s activities were &#8220;managed or organised by its senior management.&#8221;</p>
<p>The penalties for violating the act are quite interesting. First, a court can impose unlimited financial penalties on the organization, once it is convicted. Second, a court may issue a &#8220;publicity order,&#8221; which requires the organization to publicly announce (through advertisements, it seems) that it has been successfully prosecuted for corporate manslaughter and is subject to any other penalties the court may have ordered. </p>
</p>
<p>The third and final potential penalty is that the court can order the organization to publicly take remedial steps to correct the conditions that led to the breach of duty. This penalty could have potentially far-reaching consequences, depending on how the courts choose to interpret it. For example, under this remedy, suppose a court decides that a design defect was the result of conscious indifference to the safety of others (such as in the famous Ford Pinto case). The court could simply order a manufacturer to change the design of their product&#8211;a power that no American court currently possesses. </p>
<p><strong>The Impetus for the British Law: Spectacular and Disturbing Accidents</strong><br />The most direct explanation for the advent of the British law is that there have been a number of spectacular industrial and transportation accidents in the United Kingdom since the Thatcher era of privatization. This is especially true in the area of rail traffic, where the public has become increasingly uneasy about the degree to which the private train operators who took over public lines have placed profit about the public good. </p>
</p>
<p>The Southall rail crash of 1997, in which 10 people died in a high-speed train in London, illustrated for many the weakness of the old laws. The company that operated the train, GWT, was prosecuted for common-law manslaughter, but the case failed, despite the voluminous evidence that there was a systematic failure of safety management. Similar disasters involving ferry wrecks and gas works explosions helped reinforce the impression that corporations were not answerable in court because senior management always pointed the finger at someone else.</p>
<p><strong>British versus American Law on Corporate Responsibility</strong><br />In the United States, as in England, it is very difficult to hold either organizations or their officers responsible for gross negligence. For example, while many law students learn about the success civil tort plaintiffs had in suing Ford for failing to spend $13 per car to strengthen a gas tank known to be vulnerable to rear- end collisions, few learn that, at the same time, a prosecutor brought a case in criminal negligence against Ford in Indiana—and lost the jury trial.<br />&#8230;<br />In conclusion, the new Corporate Manslaughter Act is a fascinating experiment. Americans who are interested in deterring organizational wrongdoing should watch carefully to see how British judges apply the law, which prosecutions are and are not brought, and whether the law has a measurable, positive impact on either accident costs or liability costs. If the U.S. Supreme Court continues to cut back on the availability of punitive damages under state and federal law, perhaps the gap in deterrence&#8211;if there is one&#8211;created by the Supreme Court&#8217;s recent decisions could, in the future, be filled by something like the Corporate Manslaughter Act. </p></blockquote>
<p>America relies on private litigation to obtain redress of harm, but this method does not regard the company as a person in the way other parts of US law allow. The British proposal allows for this viewpoint of the fiction of &#8216;person&#8217; but does not have the private citizen mechanism for &#8216;punitive damages&#8217; that US law allows. What do we wish for?<br />(BTW, I made up the title, just like The McGyver heist between Switzerland and China)</p>

<blockquote><p>[S]ince money&#8217;s worth is only as a means to exchange goods and services, then it functions as a way to determine the worth of something. When an economy is beset by inflation or deflation, then the economy&#8217;s ability to determine the worth of goods and services is compromised.</p>
<p>My argument is that, by ensuring that the value of money remains neutral &#8211; neither inflating in price nor deflating in price &#8211; then the economy is best able to use money to its full advantage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Having lived in South America in the 70s and 80s, I know first-hand that hyperinflation makes planning difficult and is bad for the economy.  But what about small amounts of inflation or deflation?  Are we truly better off with zero real growth in the money supply?  Might not some small amount of money illusion produce a motivating factor (and if so, how much is too much)?  Is there some other reason why this might not be true?</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t know the answer to these questions.  Have at it.</p>

<p>There are a couple of rightwing rants that are like fingernails across the chalkboard for me.  One is the ongoing claim – even today – that the US labor market is just wonderful because our unemployment rate has stayed near 4.6% for some time.  Never mind the fact that the employment to population ratio has dropped from 63.4% at the end of 2006 to 62.8% as of August 2007.  The other is to claims things just suck in European nations such as Germany.  </p>
<p>As he does so often &#8211; <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=09&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=nyt_libels_germany_on_unemploy">Dean Baker</a> provides some wonderful insights on what many brain dead pundits get so very wrong:</p>
<blockquote><p>The article also misleads readers on the extent of Germany’s unemployment rate. It reports that the rate has fallen to 9 percent, implying Germany still has very high unemployment. In fact, this is the official German measure of unemployment, which counts part-time workers as being unemployed. The OECD measure for German unemployment (which uses essentially the same methodology as the U.S.) is 6.4 percent.  Since unemployment is still concentrated in the areas that were formerly East Germany, the unemployment rate in the areas that were formerly West Germany would be approximately the same as in the United States.  There is no legitimate reason for using the official German unemployment rate, which is not comparable to the U.S. rate, without explaining the distinction to readers. This is especially inappropriate since the OECD rate is so readily available.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean provides <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/WBOS/Default.aspx?QueryName=251&#038;QueryType=View&#038;Lang=en">this link</a> to the OECD data on standardized unemployment rates (SUR) from which I took our graph as to how the unemployment rate for both Germany and the US rose during the first few years of this decade.  In early 2001, SUR for Germany was 3% higher than it was for the US (that East German thing Dean mentioned).  Over the next year, our SUR grew more than Germany’s but then their SUR did not peak until July 2004 while SUR for the US peaked in June 2003.  The good news for both nations is that the unemployment rate has declined.  For the US, the current unemployment rate is still higher than it was as of January 2001 but for Germany, the unemployment rate as of July 2007 was lower than it was as of January 2001.  </p>
<p>But let’s see what <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/world/europe/12merkel.html?ex=1347249600&#038;en=6fc5a2b2eedcde33&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">Nicholas Kulish</a> wrote in the NY Times that set Dean off:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mrs. Merkel has also benefited from the resurgence of the German economy, which grew 2.9 percent last year. That is hardly scorching growth for China or India, but for a country that had not grown faster than 1.2 percent in any of the previous five years, it was terrific. Most important to national sentiment here is the ever improving job market. The unemployment rate has dropped to 9 percent, from 12 percent in 2005, the year Mrs. Merkel came to power. Most analysts attribute the jump at least in part to the controversial overhaul of the labor market led by her predecessor Gerhard Schroder &#8230; Some economists worry that the relatively modest labor market changes have fallen far short of what the German economy needs to assure its long-term competitiveness, and that the government might be well advised to use this time of prosperity to tackle the tough issues. Instead, the long-awaited recovery has led to relief and perhaps even a little complacency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our chart does not show that the German unemployment rate ever hit 12% and it indicates that it is far below 9%.  What’s the deal?  Dean explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>The article also misleads readers on the extent of Germany’s unemployment rate. It reports that the rate has fallen to 9 percent, implying Germany still has very high unemployment. In fact, this is the official German measure of unemployment, which counts part-time workers as being unemployed.</p></blockquote>
<p>To compare Germany’s official rate, which counts part-time workers as being unemployed, to the US official rate which does not (OECD’s SUR does not either) is an apples to oranges comparison.  Our graph is an oranges to oranges comparison.  Does Mr. Kulish understand what he writes about?  Or maybe he’s have us do an apples to apples comparison leaving in part-time workers for both nations.  Hmm &#8211; <a href="http://www.bls.gov./webapps/legacy/cpsatab6.htm">this source</a> says there were 25.1 million part-time workers in the US. Wow – that’s 10.8% of the civilian adult population!  Then again, the BLS defines part-time workers as “those who usually work less than 35 hours per week”.  To be honest, I don’t know how the Germans define this.  But maybe that’s why the OECD excludes part-workers from the unemployment statistics.  One would think that reporters and rightwing pundits would know better before comparing official unemployment rates across nations.</p>

                                <p>dmarek suggested <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/sardi/sardi72.html">this article</a> about government functions regarding the FDA.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The FDA doesn’t disagree with the scientific information about cherries, but it does say that cherries have not been recognized as safe and effective when used as labeled. Do we need a double-blind placebo-controlled study to prove cherries promote health?</p>
<p>Jeffrey May, editor of CCH Trade Regulation Reporter (the &#8220;publication of record&#8221; in the antitrust and trade regulation fields), quotes Rep. Ron Paul as saying there is a need to stop &#8220;federal bureaucrats from preventing Americans from learning about simple ways to improve their health.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In answer, even when the FDA had 1000 agents and up to date labs in the 1990&#8217;s, it was way too busy. Now, when global sourcing makes for a lot of proven risk so far, the FDA has 422 agents and out of date labs, whose work is screened by a political appointee from the White House. Ouch!</p>
<p>Also, in another vein some info on treatments for PTSD is related to the issue of best practice and health care.</p>
<p>There is a wonderful, rigourous double blind study by a well known expert in trauma research that suggests YOGA as a form of treatment of choice for many people as opposed to more behavioral (non-motor oriented) therapies. Significant difference ( in the reducing symptoms category), but a 50% dropout rate. Behavioral techniques had significantly lessor results but a 10% dropout rate.</p>
<p>Mental health cannot charge for Yoga lessons however, so the study was published in a non-psych journal after being refused by professional journals. Informed consent suffers, and so do clients who are not offered reasonable alternatives. I believe informed individual consent is a very conservative viewpoint, is it not?</p>
<p>Blue Cross/Blue Shield in MA will not pay for <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/reader-dan-on-combat-ptsd-and-us.html">EMDR</a>, a treatment stated as one of the best practice treatments in Britain, the VA, DoD, etc. An odd world we live in.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/4511">The Foreign Policy In Focus</a> a think tank, reports increases in the role of the US Air Force in Iraq.</p>
<blockquote><p>These assaults are part of what may be the best kept secret of the Iraq-Afghanistan conflicts: an enormous intensification of US bombardments in these and other countries in the region, the increasing number of civilian casualties such a strategy entails, and the growing role of pilot-less killers in the conflict.<br />According to <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/071507Y.shtml">Associated Press</a>, there has been a five-fold increase in the number of bombs dropped on Iraq during the first six months of 2007 over the same period in 2006. More than 30 tons of those have been cluster weapons, which take an especially heavy toll on <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070611/turse">civilians</a>.<br />The U.S. Navy has added an <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/071507Y.shtml">aircraft carrier</a> to its Persian Gulf force, and the Air Force has moved <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/071507Y.shtml">F-16s</a> into Balad air base north of Baghdad.<br />Balad, which currently conducts 10,000 air operations a week, is strengthening runways to handle the increase in air activity. Col. David Reynolds told the AP, &#8220;We would like to get to be a field like Langley, if you will.&#8221; The Langley field in Virginia is one of the Air Force&#8217;s biggest and most sophisticated airfields.<br />The Air Force certainly appears to be settling in for a long war. &#8220;Until we can determine that the Iraqis have got their air force to significant capability,&#8221; says Lt Gen. Gary North, the regional air commander, &#8220;I think the coalition will be here to support that effort.&#8221;<br />The Iraqi air force is virtually non-existent. It has no combat aircraft and only a handful of transports.<br />Improving the runways has allowed the Air Force to move B1-B bombers from Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean to Balad, where the big aircraft have been carrying out daily strikes. A B1-B can carry up to 24 tons of bombs.<br />The step-up in air attacks is partly a reflection of how beaten up and overextended U.S. ground troops are. While Army units put in 15-month tours, Air Force deployments are only four months, with some only half that. And Iraqi and Afghani insurgents have virtually no ability to inflict casualties on aircraft flying at 20,000 feet and using laser and satellite-guided weapons, in contrast to the serious damage they are doing to US ground troops.<br />Besides increasing the number of F-16s, B1-Bs, and A-10 attack planes, Predator flight hours over both countries have doubled from 2005. &#8220;The Predator is coming into its own as a no-kidding weapon verses a reconnaissance-only platform,&#8221; brags Maj. Jon Dagley, commander of the 46th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron.<br />The Air Force is also deploying a bigger, faster and more muscular version of the Predator, the MQ-9 &#8220;Reaper&#8221; — as in grim — a robot capable of carrying four Hellfire missiles, plus two 500 lb. bombs.<br />The Predators and the Reapers have several advantages, the most obvious being they don&#8217;t need pilots. &#8220;With more Reapers I could send manned airplanes home,&#8221; <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3379446">says North</a>.<br />At $8.5 million an aircraft — the smaller Predator comes in at $4.5 million apiece — they are also considerably cheaper than the F-16 ($19 million) the B1-B ($200+ million) and even the A-10 ($9.8 million).<br />The Air Force plans to deploy 170 Predators and 70 Reapers over the next three years. &#8220;It is possible that in our lifetime we will be able to run a war without ever leaving the US,&#8221; Lt Col David Branham told the <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&#038;res=9C03EFDF103BF933A15757C0A9659C8B63">New York Times</a>.<br />The result of the stepped up air war, according to the London-based organization <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/">Iraq Body Count</a>, is an increase in civilian casualties. A <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/webfiles/images/journals/lancet/s0140673606694919.pdf">Lancet</a> study of &#8220;excess deaths&#8221; caused by the Iraq war found that air attacks were responsible for 13% of the deaths — 76,000 as of June 2006 — and that 50% of the deaths of children under 15 were caused by air strikes.<br />The number of civilian deaths in Afghanistan from air strikes has created a rift between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United States.<br />&#8220;A senior British commander,&#8221; according to the <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B14F6395C0C7A8CDDA10894DF404482">New York Times</a>, has pressed U.S. Special Forces (SF) to leave southern Afghanistan because their use of air power was alienating the local people. SFs work in small teams and are dependent on air power for support. </p></blockquote>
<p>As I have been stating for awhile, the increase in the use of the Air Force is being accelerated. The notion of drones being piloted from Nevada is more disturbing than if they were piloted from the Green Zone or the Air Force base George Bush visited recently. Still, the beat goes on and on.</p>

                                <p>Reader OldVet weighs in about David Petraeus:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s the <a href="http://www.hackworth.com/">obituary</a> of a real soldier, quickly forgotten, who put out the straight word on another unpopular war.  He was also the most ferocious and unyielding combatants on our side in that conflict.  He stood head and shoulders above the rest during his time, and I only wish we had military leaders who were fit to shake his hand serving us today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most competent person I ever worked for in the private sector was a corporate Vice President whose first name was Jeff.  Jeff was like Mr. Wolf in Pulp Fiction &#8211; when something went wrong, they called him in to fix it.  (There were a few others like him &#8211; in a big corporation one fix-it person isn&#8217;t enough.  But I think he was the best of the fix-it guys.)</p>
<p>But Jeff never rose to the top ranks &#8211; he never got a seat at the the big boys table.  The reason is simple&#8230; while the top brass knew Jeff was the most competent guy they had (or they wouldn&#8217;t keep using him to solve the messes other people created), he wasn&#8217;t what they were looking for in an executive.  What they wanted in an executive was someone who says definitively:  &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221;, even if its wrong.  And Jeff was competent enough to know that the answer is never as simple as Yes or No.  So less competent individuals made it to the top&#8230;  and Jeff cleaned up after them.  </p>
<p>A guy like Hackworth &#8211; who worried about the ordinary grunts and didn&#8217;t see the simple solutions on the battlefield &#8211; well, he&#8217;s not what a President who doesn&#8217;t do nuance wants in a military commander.  And I suspect he&#8217;s not what a President who doesn&#8217;t do nuance got in a military commander.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/09/is-the-surge-wo.html">Mark Thoma</a>, an <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1014427">NBER paper</a> by Michael Greenstone from MIT.  Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a paucity of facts about the effects of the recent military Surge on conditions in Iraq and whether it is paving the way for a stable Iraq. Selective, anecdotal and incomplete analyses abound. Policy makers and defense planners must decide which measures of success or failure are most important, but until now few, if any, systematic analyses were available on which to base those decisions. This paper applies modern statistical techniques to a new data file derived from more than a dozen of the most reliable and widely-cited sources to assess the Surge&#8217;s impact on three key dimensions: the functioning of the Iraqi state (including civilian casualties); military casualties; and financial markets&#8217; assessment of Iraq&#8217;s future. The new and unusually rigorous findings presented here should help inform current evaluations of the Surge and provide a basis for better decision making about future strategy.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals mixed evidence on the Surge&#8217;s effect on key trends in Iraq. The security situation has improved insofar as civilian fatalities have declined without any concurrent increase in casualties among coalition and Iraqi troops. However, other areas, such as oil production and the number of trained Iraqi Security Forces have shown no improvement or declined. Evaluating such conflicting indicators is challenging.</p>
<p>There is, however, another way to assess the Surge. This paper shows how data from world financial markets can be used to shed light on the central question of whether the Surge has increased or diminished the prospect of today&#8217;s Iraq surviving into the future. In particular, I examine the price of Iraqi state bonds, which the Iraqi government is currently servicing, on world financial markets. After the Surge, there is a sharp decline in the price of those bonds, relative to alternative bonds. The decline signaled a 40% increase in the market&#8217;s expectation that Iraq will default. This finding suggests that to date the Surge is failing to pave the way toward a stable Iraq and may in fact be undermining it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of the folks who talk about the wisdom of the market a lot probably aren&#8217;t going to be all that happy about what the market says in this case.  My own metric that I&#8217;ve brought up a few times&#8230; the number of cheerleaders willing to vacation in Iraq with their families, has been lodged at zero since the invasion.</p>
