                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/01/martin_feldstei.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes a very nice discussion of the current account and capital flows from <a href="https://registration.ft.com/registration/barrier?referer=http://news.ft.com/comment&#038;location=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/aee14548-8143-11da-8b55-0000779e2340.html">Martin Feldstein</a>.  This jumped out at me:<br />
<blockquote>This unprecedented level is equal to 6.4 per cent of US gross domestic product. Experts estimate that the real trade-weighted value of the dollar must fall by at least 30 per cent just to shrink the trade deficit to a more sustainable level of 3 per cent of GDP.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that the trade deficit is more than 6% of GDP does not come as a surprise to anyone who has read <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~nroubini/papers/Roubini-Setser-US-External-Imbalances.pdf">Nouriel Roubini and Brad Setser</a>.  But anyone familiar with the 1981 Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic of Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace (or basic finance) has to wonder how a debtor nation avoids an ever widening debt/income ratio unless the present value of its expected future trade surpluses matches it current debt.  Roubini and Setser note, however, that the U.S. has had a persistently positive net income from abroad position despite its net indebtednesses.  We have mentioned this issue <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/multinationals-and-national-income.html">here</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/current-account-deficit-and-dark.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out that the CBO has addressed this puzzle <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/60xx/doc6043/2004-17.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/69xx/doc6905/11-30-Cross-BorderInvestment.pdf">here</a>.  The analysts consider a variety of explanations including the possibility that some of this puzzle is attributable to transfer pricing manipulation.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Luskin’s latest <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200601090951.asp">tirade</a> nitpicks at the wording of something Paul Krugman said.  OK, that’s nothing new but let’s take a look at his first substantive comment in the tirade:<br />
<blockquote>But Krugman continues to whine: “Revenue remains lower, and the federal budget deeper in deficit, than anyone expected a few years ago.” Anyone? That just can’t be true. Someone, I’ll grant you. For example, the Congressional Budget Office, in it’s August 2002 Budget and Economic Outlook — written before the 2003 tax cuts had even been proposed — expected $2.224 trillion in revenues for fiscal 2005 (the fiscal year ended last September). In a recent budget update (October 6), CBO estimated fiscal 2005 revenues at $2.154 trillion. So, for this “someone” at least, yes, revenues remain lower than expected. But barely &#8211; only by $90 billion, or about 4 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the GOP is crowing that it reduced $8 billion per year from Federal spending, Luskin scoffs that a $90 billion per year additional shortfall is chump change.  It gets even funnier when Luskin tries to convince us that tax cuts lead to faster long-term growth and pay for themselves:<br />
<blockquote>But let’s dig deeper into CBO’s analysis. Back in that 2002 report they estimated fiscal 2005 GDP to be $11.936 trillion. In fact, it turned out to be $12.308 trillion &#8211; $372 billion higher. So let’s put these numbers together. We get $90 billion less than expected in tax revenues. We get $372 billion more than expected in GDP. That’s a terrific deal, if you ask me. So while Krugman derides supply-side economics as “hokum for the yokels,” all the evidence points to the reality that lower tax rates do lead to faster economic growth … Because, as Boehner puts it, “The problem is the government is too big and takes too much money out the economy and leaves too little for investment in the future.” You want a bigger, faster-growing economy? Then cut taxes &#8211; or at least leave them at low levels, like the Republicans in Congress are trying to do. It’s so simple, even a zombie can understand it. Leftist economics professors like Krugman, though, are another matter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn’t it odd that Luskin is reporting nominal GDP rather than real GDP?  But I did take a look at the CBO forecasts back then versus the Administration forecast and the consensus of the Blue Chip forecasts in terms of real GDP.  CBO was forecasting 2.3% real growth for 2003, 3.0% real growth for 2003, and 3.2% real growth for 2004 and 2005.  Given that even the CBO was noting we were below full employment, these forecasts suggested continued weak aggregate demand relative to potential output.  The Administration and Blue Chip forecasts were projecting faster aggregate demand growth.  But as we now know, real GDP grew by only 1.6% in 2002 and 2.7% in 2003.  It is true that real GDP grew by 4.2% in 2004 and might have grown by about 3.7% in 2005 (BEA has yet to publish numbers for the fourth quarter).  Most economists believe that output eventually returns to full employment – and in my opinion, we are still not quite there.  And no economist thinks that tax cuts are the only way to stimulate aggregate demand.  </p>
<p>But why does Luskin claim as his theory for the proposition that tax cuts increase economic growth?  Is he relying on some short-term Keynesian aggregate demand story or some claim that tax cuts lead to more national savings and investment?  Let’s see – the government takes “too much money” and leaves “little for investment” is his story.  Does he even realize that George W. Bush’ is a “big government conservative” who has increased government purchases as he pretends to “give us our money back” so we can consume more?  Does Luskin not understand that when the sum of private consumption and government purchases rise as a share of national income, simple accounting dictates we have less national savings – not more?  Had Luskin bothered to comprehend the New York Times op-eds from Dr. Krugman over the past five years, he might get what even college freshman understand after a couple of principles of economics classes.  Then again – Luskin never finished his first semester as an undergraduate.</p>

                                <p>Drs. Joseph E. Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes presented a new analysis of the cost of the Iraq war on Sunday at the American Economic Association meeting in Boston. Their analysis shows the total costs will probably exceeds $2 Trillion.</p>
<p>The Boston Globe <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/01/08/economists_say_cost_of_war_could_top_2_trillion/?p1=MEWell_Pos4">reports</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The cost of the Iraq war could top $2 trillion after factoring in long-term healthcare for wounded US veterans, rebuilding a worn-down military, and accounting for other unforeseen bills and economic losses, according to a new analysis &#8230;<br />&#8230;<br />The figure is more than four times what the war was expected to cost through 2006 &#8212; around $500 billion, according to congressional budget data.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stiglitz and Bilmes included many long term macroeconomic impacts to arrive at the $2 Trillion figure, but even the direct costs are staggering:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;There are 16,000 people with serious injuries,&#8221; Stiglitz said. &#8220;That number is predicted to double [by 2010], and every injured person has health costs, plus disability. That is an obvious but important example that represents costs in Iraq not reflected&#8221; in the official numbers,</p>
<p>Those costs bring the price tag of the war up to about $650 billion, Stiglitz said, but that doesn&#8217;t include broader economic factors such as the war&#8217;s drag on the federal deficit.</p></blockquote>
<p>And Stiglitz thinks the final number might be much worse:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;There are quite a few things that are not being captured in the budgetary numbers&#8221; presented by the government, said Stiglitz, who received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001. &#8220;When you add up all of those numbers, it increases substantially. I think $2 trillion is conservative.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read the analysis yet, but I&#8217;ve wondered how we account for the loss of good will and the tarnished American brand. And what if a real threat emerges &#8211; will America have called wolf one time too often?</p>

                                <p>I used to enjoy the civility of <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0207/01/se.01.html">Congressman J. C. Watts</a> even when he tried to give the GOP credit for the reduction in the Federal deficit during the 1990’s – and in the same breath advocated tax cuts and more defense spending:<br />
<blockquote>We balanced our budget in a time of peace, proven that we had not lost the discipline so necessary for free people. We reduced taxes not once, but twice.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>[Defense spending/GDP &#8211; blue; Nondefense Federal purchases/GDP &#8211; purple]</strong></p>
<p>Which is one reason for the 2 graphs with the first showing Federal transfer payments as a percent of GDP from 1955 to 2004 and the second showing both defense spending as a share of GDP and non-defense Federal purchases as a share of GDP over the same time period.  But this post is not about the former Congressman from Oklahoma but how the National Review has already opened the 2006 debate as to fiscal policy even before the New Year’s celebration. </p>
<p>Let’s start with the advice to GOP Presidential hopefuls offered by <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/miller/miller200512290818.asp">John J. Miller</a>.  One consistent theme was that anyone who wishes to be the next Republican nominee must be for more tax cuts.  So how would Mr. Miller advise that we reduce spending so as to avoid a fiscal fiasco?  Well, let’s look at his advice to Senator Hagel: “He should be forthrightly pro-war”.  In other words, more defense spending.  So is Mr. Miller advocating returning to the low levels of transfer payments that we observed during the Eisenhower Administration?  Let’s take a look at his advice to Governor Romney:<br />
<blockquote>His top goal for 2006 is to enact health-care legislation that provides universal coverage through market mechanisms, which could put some real substance behind new claims of a Massachusetts Miracle.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess not.  Let’s hope that NRO Financial’s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200512301158.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> can remind Mr. Miller that money does not grow on trees:<br />
<blockquote>The Democrats, meanwhile, are helping Bush and the GOP by reminding the electorate that they remain soft and untrustworthy on national security and the terror war, while policyless and obstructionist on budget and tax issues. In particular, the Murtha-Pelosi obsession with immediate troop withdrawal in Iraq is playing poorly nationwide &#8211; even splitting the Democrats internally. Worse, the Democrat’s ACLU-type response to reports of NSA eavesdropping without court warrants is a huge mistake. The latest Rasmussen poll reports that 64 percent of respondents believe the National Security Agency should be allowed to tap cell phones and e-mails in order to intercept communications between suspected foreign and domestic terrorists. The key word here? National security. The key thought here? Carping Dems are not to be trusted. The key political issue here? There’s a good reason why the U.S. has not been attacked since 9/11: Tough security policies by the entire U.S. government, at home and abroad, designed and administered by the Bush administration, are in place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh good grief – is Larry going to simply engage in bashing Democrats as traitors as he fails to understand that we can have both security and civil liberties?  No, he does get around to the fiscal policy issue:<br />
<blockquote>In other words, they must nationalize the midterm elections of 2006 just as they did in 2002 (when they discussed terror war security) and just as the Gingrich Republicans did in 1994 (when smaller government, lower taxes, and no socialized healthcare took center stage) &#8230; On the economy, Bush’s pro-growth strategy should stress large-scale budget cuts (such as, for the first time, real cuts in porkbarrel spending, including corporate welfare) and permanent tax relief to sustain economic growth. The Democrats have no budget-cutting policy whatsoever, nor are they capable of developing one, while on tax cuts they have no answer except the tiresome mantra of tax hikes for the rich. Citizens Against Government Waste calls 2005 a record year for pork. The group identified 13,997 pork projects in the fiscal 2005 appropriations bills, costing taxpayers $27.3 billion, an increase of 31 percent over fiscal 2004. These are sickening facts. The president must work overtime to erase them in 2006 and truly produce a taxpayer protection budget. If Bush embraces such a Mike Pence approach, championed by the House Republican Study Committee, of shifting big-government conservatism back to limited-government conservatism, he will rejuvenate the GOP base.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Kudlow did not wish to repeat his claim that Reagan slashed Federal spending – else being hammered again by <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005-3_archives/000230.html">Brad DeLong</a> so he dusts off that old canard from Congressman Watts that it was the Gingrich Republicans who reversed the Reagan-Bush41 deficits with massive spending cuts.  But take a look at non-defense purchases and Federal transfers both as shares of GDP.  I don’t see any evidence that a small government agenda from the Gingrich Republicans were responsible for the fiscal responsibility during the Clinton Administration.  There were two significant reasons for the improved fiscal position: (1) tax rate increases that the Republicans voted against; and (2) the (temporary) peace dividend that lowered defense spending as a share of GDP.  </p>
<p>Kudlow does rightfully complain about the increase in “porkbarrel spending” which interestingly has occurred with a GOP controlled Congress under a Republican Administration.  Now it is true that Congress is patting itself on the back for reducing transfer payments by a staggering $8 billion a year.  If Kudlow thinks reducing Federal spending by less than $10 billion a year is anything other than a drop in the $600 billion a year General Fund deficit bucket, maybe Mr. Miller should not listen to him.  </p>
<p>The last time we had anything approaching a fiscally responsible small government Republican Administration was when Eisenhower was President.  Fifty years ago, the Cold War necessitated that sizeable defense spending as a share of GDP.  Unless the modern GOP convinces voters that we should return to an era of very low transfer payments – which I doubt they’ll even try to do – the notion that we should have a large defense department and permanently low taxes strikes me as simply not understanding basic arithmetic.  Yet – I suspect the National Review’s opening will be the intellectual highlight of the right wing’s mantra in this year’s fiscal policy debate.</p>

<blockquote>The year will close with the triumphant return of Budget Deficit Jesus, summoned at last by a thousand perfect burnt offerings to rapture the faithful to supply-side heaven. Those who failed to believe in the healing power of Reaganomics will be cast from this blissful Eden to a dark abyss where upper-class tax cuts do not grow the economy, but cause weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/ask/20060106.html">Treas. Sec. Snow</a> was fielding a few questions from what appeared to be a Bush friendly audience.  Beyond his insistence that tax cuts are a prerequisite for continued growth and his claim that this Administration is fiscally responsible, take a look at his response to a very good question from Jeff Burrows (hat tip to the comments section over at <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/01/and_never_is_he.html">Dr. Thoma’s</a> place):<br />
<blockquote>Jeff: Can you advise on what the recent trends and rates of the labor force participation rate? It seems that all levels of government frequently talk about the unemployment rate but I was always taught in University that this cant be looked singularily as it does not take into account persons who may be eligible to work but have left the workforce.<br />Sec. Snow: I think you&#8217;re concerned about so-called &#8220;discouraged&#8221; workers, and how they fit into discussions about employment. First, we have to look at the big picture: In the past two years, the unemployment rate has fallen nearly one percentage point overall. It has fallen even more, by 1.3 percent, when so-called &#8220;discouraged&#8221; workers are included, and that&#8217;s good news.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh – what was the good news again?  That we still have a sizeable number of folks who have been without jobs for over a year?  Jeff had an excellent question.  Too bad, the Treasury Secretary failed to answer it.  Then again – if he had, he might also be unemployed.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: I have two questions related to how Sec. Snow answered Tristan’s question regarding the unemployment rate in her state.  Here is Snow’s answer:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;d be happy to. I know that the workers of Michigan need more job creation and more good news, with your unemployment rate (at 6.5 percent) higher than the national rate of 4.9 percent. In terms of modern Michigan history, however, 6.5 percent is one of the lowest unemployment rates the state has seen.</p></blockquote>
<p>But go <a href="http://www.bls.gov/lau/home.htm">here</a> and pick Michigan from the list of states and check out its time series on the unemployment rate.  From March 1999 to October 2000, the reported unemployment rate was 4.0% or less.  Yes, there is that footnote that says “Reflects new modeling approach and reestimation as of March 2005”.  Anyone more familiar with the Michigan employment data than I am is welcomed to address my two questions: (1) what does this footnote mean in terms of comparisons across time?; and (2) was Snow guilty of stupidity or mendacity when he answered Tristan’s question?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/disappointing-job-growth-again.html">Kash</a> decides to be the first to post on AB’s new Hook ‘em Horns color scheme – so it’s time for California Angrybear to stop whining about USC’s loss and start whining about the weak labor market.  Let me provide another snippet from the BLS report:<br />
<blockquote>The employment-population ratio held at 62.8 percent in December, 0.4 percentage point higher than a year earlier.  The labor force participation rate, at 66.0 percent, was unchanged over the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it is true that the increase in employment per the Household Survey was somewhat higher than the disappointing increase per the Payroll Survey, the employment-population ratio has flat lined at 62.8%.  So why did the unemployment rate fall?  Simple – because the labor force participation rate fell from 66.1% to 66.0%.  But BLS decides to report the change over the entire year, which is an excuse for me to update one of my favorite graphs – reporting the labor force participation rate and the employment-population ratio over a period longer than just a year.  In fact, let’s graph both ratios over the past decade.</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/a5-710763.JPG"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/a5-701436.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>It is true that the employment-population ratio has risen a bit since the summer of 2003, which is one reason why the unemployment rate has fallen.  But the other reason has to do with the decline in the labor force participation rate.  If one compares the labor market situation today to that of five years ago, both ratios are significantly lower.  Now we have had a debate as to what these developments mean in terms of whether we or close to full employment or not.  Some of us on the left think much of the decline in the labor force participation rate is due to a discouraged worker effect, while some on the right would argue that some of the decline is attributable voluntary reductions.  Perhaps the reality lies somewhere in the middle, but one thing is clear: a smaller percentage of Americans have jobs today than they did five years ago even if the Administration’s minions try to tout the current labor market as the best ever.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200601061222.asp">Michael Darda</a> finds reasons not to be as disappointed as Kash was:<br />
<blockquote>The unemployment rate dropped to 4.9 percent from 5 percent, which is consistent with rising real wages over time. At the same time, 12-month job growth in the department’s household survey (a broad employment gauge that includes start-ups and the self-employed) remains considerably larger (217,000) than the 12-month job gains recorded by the more-often cited establishment (or payroll) survey (168,000). History shows that such gaps typically unwind with stronger payroll job growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Darda makes two empirical claims here: (1) real wages rise when the unemployment rate is around 5%; and (2) whenever the increase in the household survey employment figure exceeds the increase in the payroll survey employment – the latter is about to accelerate.  Of course, he provides neither evidence nor context to either claim.  </p>
<p>Darda also makes this prediction:<br />
<blockquote>As the recovery deepens and broadens during 2006, I expect the unemployment rate to drop further &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, he does not tell us if his forecast is predicated on a further decline in the labor force participation rate.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update II</em></strong>: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/01/and_never_is_he.html">Mark Thoma</a> provides a very nice follow-up on the discouraged worker effect as he realized that the BLS report deserves more credit than I gave it after my initial skim read of it.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve been traveling and spending time with family lately, so I apologize for the lack of recent posts.  Next week I&#8217;ll be back in action.  In the mean time, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that the US economy continues to disappoint when it comes to the creation of new private-sector jobs.  From this morning&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">BLS news release</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 108,000 in December, and the unemployment rate was little changed at 4.9 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  The December increase in payroll employment followed a gain of 305,000 in November (as revised).  Several industries added jobs over the month, including food services, professional and business services, health care, and manufacturing.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve just Googled the term, and find (much to my&#8230; er&#8230; disappointment) that I&#8217;ve felt compelled to use the term &#8220;disappointing&#8221; literally scores of times over the past two years when describing the performance of the US economy.  </p>
<p>The following picture helps to illustrate why.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/3mo_jobs3.jpg"></p>
<p>Even the very best 3-month job creation of this economic recovery was beaten numerous times during the period 1994-2000.  And over the past couple of years average job creation has generally been in the neighborhood of 100-200k per month, far below what we have come to expect during an economic expansion, and just barely enough to keep up with population growth.  </p>
<p>Disappointing indeed.</p>
