<blockquote>Emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to human activities continue to alter the atmosphere in ways that are expected to affect the climate.</p></blockquote>
<p></strong><br />Since Jonah Goldberg has been lecturing Andrew Sullivan on more carefully reading source material, I’m a little shocked at <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ODM2Njg4ZDhjMjhjN2E2NTk4OWVkYzlhMzJlODNmYjg=">this feeble reply</a>.  All Jonah did was to call TCS and have them whine about how their own source – which they may have misrepresented.  </p>
<p>Back to Andrew:<br />
<blockquote>I should say that I find the evidence for global warming overwhelming</p></blockquote>
<p>No argument here!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTJhZGY3Y2JmYTk0MjQ2N2UwOWVjYzg4MjI5NjhiMGQ=">Iain Murphy</a> of the Corner Kids at NRO tries to smear those of us who understand global warming by noting that the folks at the company that Ken Lay built also understand this issue.  Ah Iain, Ken Lay may have been less than honest about the accounting in late 2001 – but he was still a very smart person.</p>

                                <p>David Wessel of the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114852381134962682.html?mod=hpp_us_editors_picks">Wall Street Journal</a> is feeling bearish this morning:<br />
<blockquote>Every so often, economic forces and financial markets collide in ways that make for a tumultuous year &#8212; the stock market crash in 1987, the Asian financial crisis and bond-market paralysis in 1998, the bursting stock bubble in 2000.</p>
<p>Suddenly, this year has all the ingredients of a Big One.</p>
<p>The dollar is sinking. Global stock markets are volatile. Bond-market interest rates are climbing. Oil prices are up. Gold is at a quarter-century high. Housing prices are softening. Protectionist pressures are intensifying. General Motors Corp. is a candidate for bankruptcy court. Iran may be on the verge of going nuclear. A nasty, partisan congressional election looms. And a new Federal Reserve chairman&#8217;s inflation-fighting resolve is being tested.</p>
<p>Alan Greenspan certainly picked a good time to retire.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wessel neglected to mention the fuel that the US&#8217;s enormous current account balance adds to this unignited fire, but even so, he seems to have reasons enough for concern.  It&#8217;s not clear what the spark will be, or even whether there will be a spark at all.  There may not be.  But I think that Wessel is right to suggest that there is enough dry wood and kindling piled together to give 2006 the potential to generate more than a comfortable amount of heat and flames.</p>

                                <p>GDP growth in the first quarter of this year was just revised upward to a very robust 5.3%.  Yet a lot of analysts are disappointed:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BB6B15F97-20BE-47A7-9EEA-813141334071%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8212; The U.S. economy grew at a 5.3% annual rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday in its first revision of gross domestic product estimates.  A month ago, the government agency estimated real (inflation-adjusted) growth in the period January through March at an annualized 4.8%.</p>
<p>The upward revision was not as large as expected. Economists were expecting an upward revision to 5.6%, according to a survey conducted by MarketWatch.</p>
<p>&#8230;The upward revision was largely due to higher inventory investment and a lower trade deficit than the government had initially estimated. Commerce said that lower consumer spending on electricity and natural gas over the winter and weaker investment in equipment and software offset some of the upward revision.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my view, the report as a whole is at the margin disappointing. We had looked for a higher Q1 growth figure, and the shortfalls were in the two most important categories, consumption and business investment,&#8221; said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Why does the National Review allow <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YWRiYTExMmI4ZmMyYTAxZjAyMzQ4OGE0NWY1Njk4ZDk=">John Tamny</a> to publish such utterly stupid comments:<br />
<blockquote>If a homeowner secures a loan that enables him or her to purchase more goods, by definition there is a lender who has foregone that same consumption. There’s no direct stimulus here, just a shift of money from one person to another.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tamny is trying to suggest that the increase in the relative price of houses has no wealth effect and hence no impact on consumption or aggregate demand.  The empirical evidence suggests otherwise.  But the real concern is whether residential investment will decline.  One cannot dismiss the fact that residential investment has propped up overall investment demand over the past few years.  Tamny may have a point here:<br />
<blockquote>Far from harming our economy, a downturn in real estate has the potential to bring more capital to the stock market. England, Australia, and New Zealand offer useful examples here in that stocks rallied 17, 28, and 38 percent respectively in the years after property booms in those countries ended around the beginning of this millennium.</p></blockquote>
<p>The slump in business investment after 2000 lowered interest rates, which is one reason why residential investment was so strong.  My hope is that the recent recovery of business investment can allow continued strong aggregate demand growth even if residential investment declines.</p>
<p>So what is my real beef with the latest nonsense from the National Review?<br />
<blockquote>If there is an economic slowdown on the way, it will arguably be the result of the same weak-dollar phenomenon that drove the above-mentioned property rallies in the 1970s, and which drove the most recent one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does Tamny understand that part of the reason why aggregate demand growth was so weak over the 2001 to 2003 period was the decline in net exports?  Does he not get the simple point that the devaluation of the dollar will tend to increase net exports?  Or perhaps Tamny subscribes to the National Review theory that only core GDP (sum of consumption and investment) matters?</p>

While it was not the purpose of his post, <a href="http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/002725.html">Daniel Drezner</a> pays a very nice tribute to Bill Clinton’s first Treasury Secretary:<br />
<blockquote>The White House seems to view the Treasury Secretary as a salesman&#8217;s job, as opposed to a position where that requires any requisite policy knowledge, expertise, or anything of that nature &#8230; The truly scary thing about that last paragraph is the White House&#8217;s belief that one can find a Treasury Secretary who would be a salesman while still commanding respect in the markets. To my knowledge, the only value-added John Snow has brought to the Treasury position has been his willingness to be the Bush administration&#8217;s salesman &#8211; and I&#8217;m pretty sure the markets don&#8217;t respect him all that much.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bentsen was influential in getting Bush41 to push for the 1990 tax increase and helping Clinton assure passage of the 1993 tax increase.  The markets certainly respected Secretary Bentsen.  Of course, Bush43 does not want to admit that his fiscal policy is piling up deferred tax liabilities – so it’s unlikely that the White House could convince someone like Lloyd Bentsen to serve as Treasury Secretary unless the White House changed course over fiscal policy.</p>

                                <p>Could someone please explain <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/23/jefferson/index.html">this</a>: <br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8211; House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Tuesday that the FBI and the Justice Department &#8220;took the wrong path&#8221; when they searched a Democratic congressman&#8217;s office this weekend as part of an anti-corruption probe. &#8220;We understand that they want to support and pursue the process that the Justice Department is trying to pursue,&#8221; Hastert, a Republican from Illinois, said. &#8220;But there&#8217;s ways to do it, and my opinion is that they took the wrong path.&#8221; Over the weekend, The FBI searched the Washington home and office of Rep. William Jefferson, D-Louisiana, and found $90,000 of allegedly ill-gotten funds in the freezer of his home, according to an affidavit.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know the right side of BlogLand went nuts over law enforcement looking into potential wrongdoing by Rush Limbaugh, but the left side of BlogLand has no sympathy for this Democratic Congressman.  But the Republican Speaker of the House does?  <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/000717.php#more">Justin Rood</a> suggests:<br />
<blockquote>After sitting largely silent for more than five years of assaults against citizens&#8217; constitutional rights, our legislators have been moved to protect the Constitution because one of their own &#8211; a man who meets contacts in hotel parking lots to accept briefcases full of money, and actually kept $90,000 in cash bundled in his freezer &#8211; had his offices searched by the FBI. Methinks the Congress doth protest too much.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can anyone else provide an alternative explanation that makes any sense?  I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_05/008880.php">Kevin Drum</a> reminds us:<br />
<blockquote>But at least the FBI got a search warrant signed by a judge. Congress should feel lucky they were treated with such sensitivity.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/05/federal_officia.html">Hastert</a> is being investigated by the FBI as well.  Meanwhile, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjZjMjM1MjYzMDlmOGI3MGIxNWI0MTZlYjY4MzQzMmU=">Jonah Goldberg</a> is on the record saying:<br />
<blockquote>I think this mess &#8211; if it really amounts to a mess &#8211; could have been avoided if a more politically savvy AG were at the helm. John Ashcroft, for example, would probably have found a way to raid Jefferson&#8217;s office without needlessly ticking off Hill Republicans and giving the press a reason to ignore Democratic corruption in favor of whining about White House arrogance. </p></blockquote>
<p>That a-boy Jonah – call for the Justice Department to be just another tool of the RNC!</p>

                                <p>Bruce Bartlett and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/05/the_washington_.html">Brad DeLong</a> note that even the <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20060521-102935-9026r.htm">Washington Times</a> is challenging the credibility of our Treasury Secretary:<br />
<blockquote>According to Mr. Snow&#8217;s own numbers, which Mr. Frank had to drag out of him, over the past 12 months average nominal wages, for production and nonsupervisory employees, who account for 80 percent of private-sector employment, have increased by 3.8 percent, while consumer prices have increased by 5.1 percent. That would mean that average real wages as adjusted for inflation had declined by about 1.3 percent. That can&#8217;t illustrate &#8220;how broadly the benefits of this strong growth impact Americans,&#8221; as Mr. Snow tried to suggest. Nor, actually, is it quite as bad as the Treasury secretary grudgingly conceded. The relatively good news is that average real wages over the past 12 months actually increased by one-tenth of 1 percent, as the Labor Department announced in a companion report, &#8220;Real Earnings in April 2006,&#8221; which was issued at the same time as April&#8217;s consumer price index numbers. That&#8217;s better than the 1.3 percent decline Mr. Snow was forced to acknowledge.</p></blockquote>
<p>So which is it – did real compensation rise or fall?  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a series entitled Employer Costs for Employee Compensation, which reports a series for nominal wage and a series for nominal fringe benefits as well as the sum of these two or total compensation.  At the end of 2004, reported wages were $18.07 per hour and reported fringe benefits were $7.50 per hour so total compensation was $25.57.  At the end of 2005, reported wages were $18.59 per hour and reported fringe benefits were $7.87 per hour so total compensation was $26.46.  Also – consumer prices rose by about 3.4% during 2005.  With nominal wages rising by only 2.9% &#8211; real wages fell.  But fringe benefits rose by 4.9% resulting in an overall increase in nominal compensation of 3.5%.</p>

                                <p>Mark Thoma shared with me in an email some very odd rant from <a href="http://www.opinioneditorials.com/guestcontributors/jlarson_20060522.html">Jan Larson</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The third in a potentially never-ending &#8220;liberals are&#8221; generalization series focuses on how liberals are economically ignorant &#8230; Liberals don&#8217;t understand economics, but that doesn&#8217;t stop them from following a &#8220;liberal economic theory.&#8221; This theory is fallacious in its assumptions that the &#8220;rich&#8221; (who, according to liberals, are evil) only got that way at the expense of the poor, that government can actually pay for things and that businesses are no different than rich people, that is they are evil and must be punished. Liberals abhor the concept of profit, especially &#8220;excessive&#8221; profit. Just what is excessive profit? Any profit that is more than a liberal thinks it should be. Surprisingly, I&#8217;ve never heard of a case where a liberal sold his or her house for less than market value or took less than the maximum profit. Liberals get the vapors just thinking about &#8220;tax cuts for the rich.&#8221; Liberal economics dictates that you take money from the rich and give it to the poor. Most wealthy people didn&#8217;t get rich by accident nor did many poor people get there by accident either. People largely achieve their economic status by the decisions they make. Wealthy people start companies and create jobs. Poor people don&#8217;t. Who would you rather work for, a poor person or a rich one? The recent run up in gasoline prices has gotten liberals in a lather about oil company profits. Too much profit! Those fat, greedy, cigar-smoking oil company executives must be laughing it up as they just keep raising prices higher and higher.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like Mark, I would not have much to say about this rant given that I don’t consider rich people to be evil and I certainly don’t abhor the concept of profits.  But Mark bailed us both out with his <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/05/heretical_reali.html">link</a> to an oped from <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-mcgovern22may22,0,5962975.story?coll=la-news-comment-opinions">George McGovern</a>: <br />
<blockquote>I HAVE NEVER wavered in my support for policies that relieve poverty and improve the standard of living of American workers. As a lifelong liberal, I supported Medicare and Medicaid, civil rights, Social Security and workplace safety requirements. Today, I strongly support universal healthcare &#8230; The current frenzy over Wal-Mart is instructive. Its size is unprecedented. Yet for all its billions in profit, it still amounts to less than four cents on the dollar. Raise the cost of employing people, and the company will eliminate jobs. Its business model only works on low prices, which require low labor costs. Whether that is fair or not is a debate for another time. It is instructive, however, that consumers continue to enjoy these low prices and that thousands of applicants continue to apply for those jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sure that some of my fellow economist bloggers might find some reasons to be concerned about the economics inherent in how Wal-Mart runs its business.  For now, I’ll just point out that perhaps the most liberal Democrat to win our nomination for the Presidency (at least in my lifetime) does not abhor profits.  Incidentally, Mr. Larson holds an MBA – not a Ph.D. in economics.</p>

Niskanen and Peter Van Doren</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The first conclusion from these tests is that there was no significant effect on the relative level of federal spending &#8230; The more important conclusion, consistent with my prior estimate of this equation, is that there was a very strong negative relation between the relative level of federal spending and the relative level of federal revenues in the sample 1981-2000 &#8230; What happened in federal fiscal politics that might explain the substantial difference in the estimates from these two samples? We do not know, but we suspect that the growing influence of the “supply siders,” who have a strong case that high marginal tax rates significantly reduce economic growth, undermined the influence of the traditional fiscal conservatives’ commitment to a balanced budget&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark cautions us not to put too much faith in these regressions.  While I agree with Mark, maybe we can provide an answer to this question about fiscal politics by reviewing the ratios of revenues (Rev) and expenditures (Exp) to GDP over the 1949 to 2005 period.  My view is that we have had four fiscal regimes since World War II ended.  The regime that extended from President Truman to President Carter – which included Democratic and Republican Administrations – was one of general fiscal responsibility.  Over such a regime, it would not be surprising that revenues and expenditures would tend to be correlated.  Despite the general upward trend in the size of the Federal government, however, there was little variation in these ratios.  </p>

<p>As Niskanen and Van Doren note – we had a change in fiscal regimes after 1980 with a pack of free lunch supply-siders telling President Reagan that we could have more defense spending and lower tax rates at the same time.  The third fiscal regime combined two virtuous features.  One was the good fortune of having political leaders with what Brad DeLong called “feck” (as Brad was drinking his morning can of diet Pepsi).  The other was the peace dividend.  So we should not be surprised the revenue/GDP and expenditure/GDP ratios moved in opposite directions.   </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the last five years have been dominated by feckless politicians as well as a reversal of the peace dividend.  One would think President George W. Bush would have paid for the Global War on Terror with either a tax increase or reductions in Federal spending.  Yet, we see him today passing out free money to seniors in the form of that prescription drug benefit as he advocated more tax cuts.  We don’t need regression equations to tell us that we will one day have to enter into a fifth fiscal regime that hopefully resembles what we saw during the 1990’s.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Perhaps macroeconomic professors should assign the latest from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzBkMTYzNjE3NTg0YmE3Y2Y4MTE5MzJkM2M5ZDM2OTM=">Cesar Conda &#038; Ernest S. Christian</a> (C&#038;C) as reading material with an attached essay question designed to let their students find the various flaws in the argument:<br />
<blockquote>The recipe for high GDP growth in the future is the same as it was in 2003-04, when the combination of lower tax rates and “bonus depreciation” caused a spurt in investment that helped lead the economy out of recession and toward its current strong standing &#8230; Standard neoclassical econometric models confirm what common sense and experience suggest: Replacing old-fashioned tax depreciation with immediate first-year expensing would add more than $200 billion to GDP, boost wage incomes, and add upwards of 750,000 jobs. Because the static revenue cost of first-year expensing quickly phases out after four years, it is also in the long term the cheapest, most bang-for-the-buck, and most growth-oriented tax change the Congress could make. When you use dynamic scoring that takes into account induced economic growth, first-year expensing costs nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>The essay question could be posed in terms of several aspects of C&#038;C’s “argument”, which they are very unclear about.  First, C&#038;C do not tell us the size of the alleged direct impact on investment demand from this accelerated depreciation treatment for tax purposes.  Secondly and more importantly, any neoclassical presumes full employment so an outward shift of the investment demand schedule would increase interest rates so as to reduce consumption demand.  The net impact on investment demand must equal the decline in consumption and would tend to be much less than the direct impact.  One would have to make assumptions to the elasticity of investment demand and the elasticity of saving (the supply curve if you will).</p>
<p>Even after one ascertained the (likely very small) net increase in annual investment spending, the premise of the neoclassical growth model is that output per capita grows very slowly over time when an economy engineers a capital deepening policy.  The short-run impact on tax revenues would be negative, which begs the question – how is the government making up for the loss of tax revenues?  Is there some offsetting reduction in government spending?  If not, can we even be sure that national savings increases?  </p>
<p>But I digress – so back to the dynamics.  C&#038;C are suggesting that this change in tax policy will (someday) increase output by $200 billion.  Since that is clearly not the immediate impact, how many years will we have to wait to realize this alleged increase in output?  </p>
<p><em>Bonus Question</em>: Begin by taking a look at the fourth diagram of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/outlook.html">The Nation’s Fiscal Outlook</a>, which is part of OMB’s Budget of the United States Government &#8211; Fiscal Year 2007, and then explain what <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002215.html">Edward Lazear</a> was trying to say (hint: I can’t explain it).  </p>
<p><em>Added Bonus</em>: <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/columnist/article/economist/4065">Charles Wheelan</a> mocks the Laffer Curve nonsense with this analogy:<br />
<blockquote>Can&#8217;t Lose Weight by Eating More: Neither the Reagan nor the George W. Bush tax cuts were &#8220;self-financing,&#8221; as the Laffer disciples like to argue. According to The Economist &#8211; my former employer and no bastion of left-wing thought &#8211; the current Bush Administration&#8217;s top economist, Gregory Mankiw, estimated that decreasing taxes on labor would generate enough growth to recoup only about 17 cents for each lost dollar; a tax cut on capital is better, paying for more than half of itself. Still, the bottom line from the Bush Administration itself is that tax cuts reduce Uncle Sam&#8217;s take. So why does Laffer&#8217;s sketch on Dick Cheney&#8217;s cocktail napkin rank near the top of my list of bad economic ideas? Because, when applied to the U.S., it&#8217;s intellectually dishonest. The Laffer Curve offers the false promise that we can cut taxes without making any sacrifice on the spending side, and that&#8217;s simply not true. It&#8217;s the economic equivalent of arguing that you can lose weight by eating more … Whether it&#8217;s tax policy or dieting, you can&#8217;t have your cake and lose weight, too, which is why America currently has huge deficits and a lot of fat people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Lazear flunks, while Mr. Wheelan aces the test!</p>
