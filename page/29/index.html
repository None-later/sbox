                                <p>Via Robert Waldmann <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/making-risk-taking-riskier-will-hurt-startups.html%22">Richard Thaler</a> at <i>Bloomberg</i> provides a different take on innovators and job creators:</p>
<blockquote><p>A recurring theme of this year’s presidential campaign is the need to encourage the formation of new businesses. Republicans in general, and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/mitt-romney/">Mitt Romney</a> in particular, have stressed that the best way to stimulate such startups is via low tax rates on high-income earners.<br />…<br />In other words, this is a strategy that emphasizes maximizing the after-tax returns if and when you hit it big. Yet if you think about the way most new businesses are started, it should be clear that these tax incentives have very <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-10/the-real-reason-romney-s-tax-math-doesn-t-add-up.html">little to do</a> with the decisions facing most new entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The typical business startup (think Joe the Plumber) begins with an initial stake that has been saved or borrowed, and 97 percent of small-business owners make less than $250,000 a year. It is a good bet that when <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/bill-gates/">Bill Gates</a>, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/steve-jobs/">Steve Jobs</a> and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/larry-page/">Larry Page</a> were creating their new businesses in their proverbial garages, they weren’t giving much thought to the tax rate they would have to pay if they struck it rich.<br />…<br />The essence of Stewart’s idea goes to the heart of why our economy is largely organized around limited-liability public corporations. When successful entrepreneurs decide to take their businesses public, they are selling some of the upside to other shareholders in return for making sure that they can’t lose all their wealth if something at the company goes wrong.</p>
<p>So-Called Reform</p>
<p>What about smaller startups that don’t begin their lives as corporations? One thing that would help stimulate this sort of business creation is making sure that a business bankruptcy is not ruinous to the entrepreneur’s family. But the Republican- sponsored bankruptcy “reform” <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-10-28/bankruptcy-reform-bites-back">law of 2005</a> changed the rules in the opposite direction. For someone who uses a <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/credit-card/">credit card</a> to help open a bakery or landscaping business, this law raised the cost of failure.</p></blockquote>

<p>A Question About Apple</p>
<p>My wife has been an Apple user for a long time. I on the other hand have tended to avoid purchasing Apple products for myself &#8211; I just cannot get around the concept of a single button on a mouse, nor why I should be interested in buying a product whose manufacturer apparently makes conscious decisions to remove features based on someone&#8217;s aesthetic sense rather than usability. That said, I did notice that Apple products had a tendency to be reliable, though that reliability certainly came at a price.</p>
<p>Recently, my wife convinced to ditch my Droid for an i-Phone so we could use facetime. Perhaps because of that, I&#8217;ve become overly sensitive to issues involving Apple products as of late. My mom has a keyboard for her iPad which seems to have stopped working. (I was the one who originally recommended she buy an iPad as I figured it would be easy enough for someone as technologically unsavvy as her to use easily.) The only way I can get my iPhone to admit I have a voice-mail is to power it off completely and then turn it on again. It&#8217;s been that way from day one &#8211; at first I chalked it up to yet another thing about the phone, but my wife told me it wasn&#8217;t supposed to behave that way. And I notice my wife has been complaining about her Mac &#8211; something that didn&#8217;t happen except rarely with its umpteen predecessors. </p>
<p>Is this just something from my immediate circle (i.e., random anecdotes) or are the company&#8217;s products becoming less reliable? Anyone else notice anything?</p>

                                <p>I’m a political junkie, born and bred.  And so the number of political opinion pieces I’ve read in my life, dating back to my teenage years (me being a child of my parents, they of the ardent liberal Democrat variety&#8211; “Oh, no, Bevy!  You have to return that purse.  That company is anti-union!”  “Okayyy, Mom.”)&#8211;run probably into the thousands.  (Yikes.)  </p>
<p>And I’ve certainly read, ah-hem, a few pieces by established, mainstream columnists in respected newspapers and magazines that have made my eyes roll or made me shake my head in dismay because of some obvious flaw in logic or some clearly false representation of fact upon which the writer’s premise lies.  </p>
<p>But I don’t think I’ve ever before read such a mystifyingly wacky, whiplash-inducing, incomprehensibly-false-fact-based commentary as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/opinion/brooks-the-collective-turn.html?_r=0">the one I just read</a>, by David Brooks, in today&#8217;s New York Times.  The premise: That Obama’s argument for returning the federal government’s domestic-policy emphasis to trying to increase economic and social mobility, improving public infrastructure, encouraging individual creativity, inventiveness and risk-taking, and trying to help limit climate change, Obama was arguing for … you guessed it! (at least if you read Brooks’s columns even occasionally, as I do) … European-style central-government control (commands from “headquarters”; seriously) over the private sector and the private sector’s creativeness and innovativeness.  </p>
<p>No, sir!  Wouldn’t want any of that socialist German-style engineering expertise to make its way across the Atlantic. Especially since all those engineers at, say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens">Siemens</a> got their engineering degrees at &#8212; and this is really dangerous&#8211;places like the University of Heidelberg!  Which is, OMG, a public university!  Supported by German taxes.  And financially accessible by some students whose families are not upscale!</p>
<p>Yup.  And that engineering and computer science school at the University of Illinois, regularly rated among the top such programs in the country, can’t possibly have produced someone who, say, while attending the school, developed the World Wide Web by developing the first Internet browser, called Mosaic, which became Netscape.  Uh-uh.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a> only thinks his college memories of life in Champaign, Ill. But they’re really of life in Palo Alto.  Or maybe Cambridge, Mass.  And how did that Wisconsin native even manage to invent anything at all, given the “hammock” (Paul Ryan’s term, not Brooks’s) he found himself in when he (probably) took out a low-interest, no-repayments-required-until-five-years-after-graduation loan to pay that out-of-state tuition back in the late 1980s, and early 1990s, under a federal Great Society program? </p>
<p>The whiplash-inducing stuff in Brooks’s column appears at two points. The first one comes about midway through the column, when Brooks switches from praising the Obama speech as a strong argument for collective government policies to, say, assist in economic and social mobility.  The second one comes late in the column, after paragraphs in which he says such things as that we have a much more dynamic and innovative private sector than does Europe because colleges and universities in the Unites States are private rather than public and Europe’s are public rather than private (I’m not joking or exaggerating; he says this), and that the programs Obama supports, such as student loan programs and financial support for schools and medical and scientific research and the like, are attempts by political progressives to undermine private enterprise and control the private sector from Washington.  He then concedes, apparently unwittingly&#8211;he seems unaware, at least, of the irony&#8211;that public programs and financial regulations can (and do!) assist creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>You really have to read the whole column to get the full flavor.  Just put on a neck brace first.</p>
<p>And while you’re reading it, remind yourself that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell">Alexander Graham Bel</a>l, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_">Henry Ford</a> did not attend a private college.  Nor did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi">Enrico Fermi </a>or some of the other great physicists who emigrated to this country in the late 1930s after receiving their education at public universities&#8211;in Europe!  </p>
<p>And that David Brooks did attend a private university: the University of Chicago.  And that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brooks_(journalist)">his Philadelphia Main Line parents </a>probably paid his tuition and room and board, free and clear.</p>
<p>Enough said. I think.  Unless of course he’s invented something that I don’t know of.  And that’s useful. </p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*PS: Indulge me in my obsession with idiocy from big-name, mainstream political pundits, writing in (or on) prestigious, widely read political-commentary forums.  Neither David Brooks <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">nor Dana Milba</a><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">nk</a> is, after all, all that important, I recognize.  But Brooks, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/he-asked-not-what-his-country-can-do.html">if not Milbank</a>, flatly crossed the line into misrepresentation of fact in a way that is really beyond the pale. And no one but me probably even noticed.  </p>
<p>Frustrating. </p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />ANOTHER PS: As I said in response to a comment in the Comments thread, Brooks’s longtime shtick is anti-European&#8211;as in, Europe’s standard of living is lower than ours and that’s because their socialist policies deter creativity and innovation and therefore “dynamism.” He’s apparently run out of plausible-sounding arguments to support his belief, so he just blathers the claim incoherently, as needed.</p>

Its a pretty good list.</p>

<p>His thoughts on what is more mainstream caught my fancy as well. Angry Bear has developed a solid readership since 2003, but economic blogs were anything but mainstream even six/seven years ago, and are common to major media outlets now. September 2008 brought a big jump in readership to most of the econoblog world. But which are closer to mainstream?  And how does that impact what is covered?  Who is the audience today?  Worth pondering. </p>

<p> Dell&#8217;s Offshored Cash Hoard and Fair Taxes</p>
<p> As most people who follow mergers, acquisitions and other mega transactions are likely aware, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dell">Michael Dell</a> wants to take the company he founded private in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveraged_buyout">leveraged buyout</a>. LBOs, of course, use the company&#8217;s own assets as collateral for debt to purchase the company&#8211;one of the types of financial alchemy that has contributed to the last thirty years of corporate consolidations and elite wealth accumulation, both of which are problematic for sustainable economies and sustainable democracies. </p>
<p>Michael Dell has a particularly interesting &#8220;problem&#8221;. Like most high-technology companies, Dell has avoided a lot of US tax by offshoring and claiming its profits in offshore tax havens rather than in the US. So it has more than $14 billion of highly liquid assets in offshore affiliates and not here. See Zahary Mider and Jesse Drucker, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-18/dell-leveraged-buyout-may-hinge-on-cash-hoard-outside-u-s-.html">Dell Leveraged Buyout May Hinge on Cash Hoard Outside US</a>, Bloomberg.com (Jan. 18, 2013).</p>
<p>We shouldn&#8217;t allow that, but fixing it would require real corporate tax reform, not the stuff that commissions and Congress blather on about most of the time, like &#8220;lowering tax rates&#8221; and &#8220;simplifying the tax code&#8221;, both of which are nonsensical when it comes to corporate multinationals who pay incredibly low <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate">effective tax rates</a> already and who will use any &#8220;simplification&#8221; as just another inviation to exercise their sophisticated tax skills at manipulating the Code for their private tax advantage. </p>
<p>Congress of course hasn&#8217;t had the gumption to take on Big IT for years.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>And under the Bush Administration, when Congress and the Treasury seemed to be motivated primarily by seeing how fast they could give away tax breaks to corporate business through the tax code, Congress enacted one of its most foolhardy tax expenditures that especially benefited corporations that had been &#8220;bad&#8221; tax citizens&#8211;the 2004 misnamed &#8220;American Jobs Creation Act&#8221; that allowed the bad companies that had offshored their profits to avoid tax the indulgence of bringing those untaxed profits home at what amounted to no or negative tax rates&#8211;the so-called &#8220;repatriation holiday&#8221; provision. As usual, the right-wing claimed that these corporate tax breaks would create jobs. They didn&#8217;t (as shown by Bush&#8217;s dismal job creation record, even before the onset of the great Recession). Instead, they were used for corporate stock buybacks and similar goodies for those investors who are mostly the wealthy upper-class who own most of the corporate assets. So the repatriation tax holiday exemplified the problems of the corporatist agenda and the way it exacerbates inequality, a kind of class warfare in bits and increments. </p>
<p>So we can expect a new onslaught of lobbying by companies like Dell for another extraordinarily wasteful &#8220;repatriation holiday.&#8221; The lobbyists will claim that such corporate tax cuts are essential if we want big companies to keep creating jobs. But that&#8217;s bunk. The evidence is in from the last repatriation holidy&#8211;it lined the pockets of the rich, as most of these corporate tax breaks have done and did not create jobs.</p>
<p>Obama and the Democrats in Congress should resist. Ordinary Americans should not bear the burden of ordinary income rates when the wealthy are taxed at preferential capital gains rates. And ordinary Americans surely shouldn&#8217;t be called upon yet again to subsidize profit-making corporation&#8217;s low-tax regimes through the cuts ordinary Americans will suffer to needed services. </p>

<div dir="ltr">There was less wow in the address that preceded [singer Kelly] Clarkson. Obama teased the crowd with a theme of unity: “Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation and one people.” But his “we the people” theme turned out to be more of a campaign retread. “We the people understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it,” he said. “We reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future.”</div>
<div dir="ltr">And we the people accept that we live in an era of diminished oratory.</div>

<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-brings-more-optimism-partisanship-and-populism-to-second-inaugural-speech/2013/01/21/ad3a04ec-4d0f-11e2-950a-7863a013264b_story.html?hpid=z3">Dana Milbank</a>, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">professional Centrist</a>, Washington Post</div>
<p>Yes, and we the people also accept that some high-profile, highly-paid, political pundits make careers out of confusing vapidity with statesmanship.  And oratory with substance. </p>
<p>And rote, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-president-congeniality-talks-tough/2013/01/14/6f5b50a0-5e9d-11e2-90a0-73c8343c6d61_print.html">formulaic</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/apparently-national-reviews-editors.html">nonsense</a> with analysis. </p>
<p>Ask not what your political pundit can do for your understanding of substantive policy issues and politics&#8211;ask what you can do for your political pundit’s logic compass.  Which I think is to stop reading his column. </p>

Jan Brewer probably isn&#8217;t as bad as Evan Meacham, but that&#8217;s the best anyone has said. Bob McDonnell at least <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/News/viewRelease.cfm?id=1620">proclaimed today Martin Luther King, Jr., Day</a>,* even if the kids don&#8217;t get it off, the way they do for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fredericksburg">real heroes of his state</a>. </p>
</p>
<p>*It would be petty of me to note that McDonnell&#8217;s proclamation conspicuously leaves the &#8220;Dr.&#8221; off the front of Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.  I guess a Ph.D. from Boston University isn&#8217;t worth all that much.</p>

<p>
<div dir="ltr">But I have my own suggestion to Mackey: Consider expanding your company to other countries. Australia, maybe.  Germany.  Canada.  Sweden. France. Britain.  Norway.  Holland.  Maybe even Israel and Poland, both of them countries whose healthcare system Mitt Romney praised last summer.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Or maybe Switzerland, where&#8211;as another reader commented in the earlier thread, in noting your praise of the Swiss health system, Mr. Mackey&#8211;you can see a fascist (or is it a socialist?) system at work, while admiring the beautiful mountainscape and maybe even skiing in it.</div>

                                <p>This was a throw-down-the-gauntlet speech.  </p>
<p>We have ourselves a leader.  </p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />UPDATE: E.J. Dionne <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/01/21/obamas-unapologetic-inaugural-address/?hpid=z4">equates this speech</a> with FDR&#8217;s second inaugural speech and Reagan&#8217;s first one, in its importance.  I hadn&#8217;t thought of Reagan&#8217;s&#8211;and of course the substance of today&#8217;s speech was the mirror image, the opposite, of Reagan&#8217;s&#8211;and I wasn&#8217;t alive for any of FDR&#8217;s speeches.  But my very first reaction to the speech today was to think that it probably was similar in its essence to FDR&#8217;s 1937 inaugural speech.  Just an instinct, but apparently I was right. </p>
<p>PS: Also, be sure not to miss Greg Sargent&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/01/21/an-expansive-case-for-progressive-governance-grounded-in-language-of-founding-fathers/">specific comparison </a>of the speech to FDR&#8217;s second inaugural one.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s happening, folks.  It&#8217;s finally happening. It&#8217;s finally our turn.</p>

<p> Healthcare Reform; Socialism or Fascism?</p>
<p>Whole Foods CEO John Mackey in 2009 originally called President Obama&#8217;s healthcare plan a form of Socialism while writing an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people&#8217;s money.&#8221;</i> <i>Margaret</i> <i>Thatcher&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>and added to Thatcher&#8217;s statement:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;While we clearly need health-care reform, the last thing our country needs is a massive new health-care entitlement that will create hundreds of billions of dollars of new unfunded deficits and move us much closer to a government takeover of our health-care system,&#8221; he wrote.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Mackey joins other CEO&#8217;s (Papa Johns, Olive Garden, Applebees, etc.) (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/12/raising-price-of-pizza-10-to-14-cents.html"><i>Raising the Cost of Pizza 10 to 14 cents</i></a>); who refuse to understand the need for healthcare reform, support a commercial healthcare insurance and industry solution even though both have done little to voluntarily rein in costs, are willing to penalize their employees for the PPACA, and ignore the results of doing nothing and associated increased costs. Since Hillarycare (1994), the industry has ignored increasing costs and has not provided solutions to mitigate them. As shown in Figure 1 annual healthcare cost has grown much faster than inflation. Figure 4 shows the increase in House hold expenditures since 1994 when Hillarycare was considered.<i></i></p>

<p>Recently during an NPR interview, John Mackey changed his opinion calling the PPACA fascism instead of Socialism:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Technically speaking, it&#8217;s more like fascism. Socialism is where the government owns the means of production. In fascism, the government doesn&#8217;t own the means of production, but they do control it — and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening with our health care programs and these reforms.&#8221; </i><a href="http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/whole-foods-obamacare-facist-socialist/2013/01/16/id/471765">Obamacare Is Fascist, Not Socialist</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In a short period after labeling the PPACA as fascism, John Mackey reconsiders his words after a public uproar and retracted his name-calling of President Obama as a fascist and the PPACA as fascism. All of this from a Liberal now turned Libertarian.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>The term fascism today stirs up too much negative emotion with its horrific associations in the 20th century,&#8221; he said.</i> </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;I believe that, if the goal is universal health care, our country would be far better served by combining free enterprise capitalism with a strong governmental safety net for our poorest citizens and those with preexisting conditions, helping everyone to be able to buy insurance. This is what Switzerland does and I think we would be much better off copying that system than where we are currently headed in the United States.</i>&#8221; <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/business/whole-foods-ceo-regrets-comparing-obamacare-fascism-1B8022914">Whole Foods CEO Regrets . . .&#8221;</a></p></blockquote>
<p>It has only been since the passage of the PPACA (see S&#038;P Healthcare Indices) has the healthcare industry begun to rein in costs as reflected in Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHPS through efficiencies. Much of this is due to the healthcare industry rapidly preparing for the 2014 final implementation of the PPACA. More will come after 2014.</p>
<p>You would think this would be enough? At the same time, the Republicans are calling for cuts to the three programs to lower deficit spending; the President is offering to consider modest cuts and shows willingness to sell-out the citizens to achieve his Grand Deal. Cuts in any of the programs will do nothing to lower healthcare industry cost as these programs are a reflection of the industry. In the end, such a Grand Deal will lay the burden of healthcare costs on the elderly, the poor and the children of this nation. The &#8220;I Made This&#8221; John Mackeys of the world who became rich as a result his customers buying from Whole Foods will absolve themselves of any social responsibility.</p>
