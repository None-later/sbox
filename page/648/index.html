<p>You cannot rely on the US media.  The media in general sustains the cultural mendacity engulfing the military industrial complex.</p>
<p>April 23, 2008,  Seattle Post-Intelligencer<br />Dicks, Tiahrt &#8216;Porkers Of The Month&#8217; Over Tanker<br />By Eric Rosenberg, P-I Washington Bureau<br />
<blockquote>“WASHINGTON &#8212; A government watchdog group gave its wry &#8220;Porkers of the Month&#8221; award Tuesday to Reps. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., and Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., for their support of The Boeing Co.&#8217;s efforts to build Air Force tanker planes.<br />The nonpartisan group, Citizens Against Government Waste, said Dicks and Tiahrt won the porkers moniker &#8212; which refers to pork-barrel federal spending &#8212; because they have threatened congressional action to cancel the Air Force tanker contract won by a Boeing rival, a team of Airbus-parent EADS and Northrop Grumman.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Citizens Against Government Waste has a recondite concept of waste.  Googling Citizens Against Government Waste, you will find their issue is that Dicks and Taihrt are keeping the Renton Washington, USA, Boeing 767 line running, while the lower to no pork approach to building a useless aerial refueling tanker includes keeping the plant at Toulouse, France running but conceiving a  risky assembly facility in Mobile is not called pork.</p>
<p>Pork for Northrop, France and a little bit for Mobile Al. is okay, while keeping the effective long serving Boeing fabrication and assembly in the US is pork.  The gall!</p>
<p>More references to Citizens Against Governemnt Waste show they get most of their funding from corporations and their issues are primarily for big business.</p>
<p>There are always two sides to an issue and the failure to see the issue as ‘whittling a beak’ shows that Citizens Against Government Waste are not what their title implies.  Somewhere the corporate donor list has a shade of Northrop and Airbus.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>

                                <p>A few AB readers have complained that I have been very hard on John McCain’s proposed fiscal irresponsibility but rather silent on what Clinton and Obama have been saying.  Only M. Jed does something constructive as he brings to my attention <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/24/AR2008042402917_pf.html">Who’ll Cover the Checks</a> in the Friday edition of the Washington Post:</p>
<blockquote><p>By our calculations, using figures supplied by the campaigns, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) has proposed new spending and tax breaks that would amount to almost $265 billion a year when fully implemented, while the initiatives proposed by Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.) total nearly $333 billion. Those initiatives, which would be phased in over time and which the candidates say they have identified ways of funding, don&#8217;t include billions of dollars more in one-time spending.  In addition, both candidates would extend the Bush tax cuts for those making less than $250,000 a year, at an annual cost of another $140 billion in 2012, and renew the research tax credit ($9 billion). And both say they would take steps to prevent the alternative minimum tax from sweeping in additional taxpayers, adding $50 billion or so to the annual price tag. So the deficit &#8212; even before any new spending &#8212; would be that much deeper than it would have been if the tax cuts were permitted to expire.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, both Democrats have talked about raising some tax rates, which the oped later briefly acknowledges.  And I’d be foolish to take on face value something the WaPo calls “by our calculations”.  But there is a general point that I agree with.  If the Democrats are proposing increasing our commitment to Federal funded of health care, someone will have to pay taxes for this at some time.  During the 2004 campaign, I recoiled whenever John Kerry said he’s cut taxes for the middleclass.  At the time, the Federal fiscal budget was massively out of balance.  That general fact has not changed.  If the Democrats are pretending that only the very rich will have to pay higher taxes to bail out George W. Bush’s fiscal fiasco, someone should call this misleading.  It is!</p>
<p>In early 1993, one of my expressions for what President Clinton was thinking went like this: “read my lips, much higher taxes”.  It was the right thing to do for 1993 and it will be the right thing to do in 2009.  So the subtitle of this oped, which is “The Democratic candidates&#8217; tax and spending plans are costly and ambitious &#8212; and probably short on fiscal realism”, may have merit. But in my defense, their statements are not nearly as  insane or dishonest as the garbage being peddled by John McCain.</p>
<p>Update: AB reader Brooks offered lots of links to fiscal policy discussions.  One is them takes us to <a href="http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/blog/_archives/2008/4/17/3644935.html">Howard Gleckman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To be fair, only Clinton actually set the bar at $250,000. Obama was a lot squishier. After dancing around for a while, he finally concluded “it depends on how you calculate it, but it would be between $200,000 and $250,000.” Obama also muddied the waters a bit more by repeating an earlier campaign proposal to fix Social Security’s shortfall by increasing the payroll tax cap for those making more than about $100,000. This, to him, is apparently not a tax increase. Of course neither candidate was finished. Both have also proposed billions in tax cuts for the middle-class. Clinton would fix the Alternative Minimum Tax, cut taxes for married couples, and families with kids. Obama would do the same for seniors, homeowners, and working families. And, being Democrats, they have lots of new programs they want to spend on. Clinton has a $150 billion alternative energy program and a costly health care reform plan. Obama has his own pricey plans for health care, infrastructure, and job training.  How are they going to pay for all this? Both candidates also promised to roll back the Bush tax cuts for those making more than $250,000. According to TPC estimates, that would raise about $1.2 trillion over 10 years. It sounds like a lot, but it would barely pay for AMT relief. Beyond the individual numbers, there is a bigger problem here. I’m the last guy to defend the Bush tax cuts, especially for high earners. Many of these tax breaks should be rolled back. But it is neither politically nor economically sensible to think you can solve all of the nation’s fiscal problems or pay for all your campaign promises on the backs of 3% of households. We are all in this mess, and we all need to contribute something to cleaning it up. Even those middle-class families struggling to get by on a mere quarter of a million dollars-a-year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said!</p>

                                <p>The other day <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/unemployment-duration.html">Spencer posted</a> a chart that Cactus had sent and then Cactus posted the link to the data.  After looking at the data, and considering the question being asked: Are we seeing a recession?  I thought, maybe looking at just median weeks of unemployment or number of unemployed is not going to capture the true picture.  </p>
<p>During a recession or in determining a recession would not the amount of idle labor be more of a factor?  If we have 5 of 10 people unemployed for 5 weeks, is that worse than 6 of 10 unemployed for 4 weeks?</p>
<p>For this chart <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/categories/12">I used</a> average weeks unemployed times the number of unemployed looking at the first day of the first month and the first day of the seventh month to come up with a factor we can call Person Weeks Unemployed: PWU.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SBQAKIrT8pI/AAAAAAAAAII/_uObDvTVF_k/s1600-h/Person+Weeks+of+Unemployment.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SBQAKIrT8pI/AAAAAAAAAII/_uObDvTVF_k/s400/Person+Weeks+of+Unemployment.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As you can see, our economy has been performing worse as time goes on.  The Y axis number need to by X1000.   </p>
<p>We are leaving a lot of work on the table and the swings have gotten larger.  Larger swings in labor sitting idle is the opposite of what we are praising in the GDP swings.  And, note when the big swings started, right when we de-coupled the rise in productivity from the rise in wages: 1974  Up until that time, the lost labor fluctuates around the 50,000 mark.  During the first oil shock, we hit a new high of 125,000 person weeks.  No wonder the mood sucked during Carter&#8217;s years.  At least it came back down to the upper end of the range we had been in since 1958.  Unfortunately, since we decided to focus on money (yes Reagan) we seem to waffle around 125,000.  A full 75,000 person weeks of lost work. </p>
<p>However, what is more interesting is the peaks of PWU in relation to the official <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">recession dates</a>.<br />Recession 11/48 to 10/49 but the PWU peaks 1/1950  3 month delay<br />Recession 7/53 to 5/54,   PWU peaks  7/1954,   2 month delay<br />Recession 8/57 to 4/58,   PWU peaks 7/1958,   3 month delay<br />Recession 4/60 to 2/61,   PWU peaks 7/1961,   5 month delay<br />Recession 12/69 to 11/70,   PWU peaks 1/1972,   14 month delay<br />Recession 11/73 to 3/75,   PWU peaks  1/1976,   10 month delay<br />Recession 1/80 to 7/80,   PWU peaks 1/1981,   6 month delay<br />Recession 7/81 to 11/82,   PWU peaks 1/1983,   2 month delay <br />Recession 7/90 to 3/91,   PWU peaks 7/1992,   16 month delay<br />Recession 3/01 to 11/01,   PWU peaks 7/2003,   20 month delay (updated to correct math error)</p>
<p>Some may say: Hey, Reagan did good!  But, if we ignore the blip of economic reprieve it is 30 months from the end of the first recession to the peak of PWU after the second.  And he set it good, going from a previous high of 125,000 to 223,000!</p>
<p>So what do you think?  I think that what matters to people regarding a recession is whether they are working and not when the government states the turn-around began.  Thus, the peak of a recession is in the eye of the beholder.  If you&#8217;re a person earning money from labor, a recession these days can last a very long time.  This data would suggest that what we are seeing in the Spencer post is not a decreased risk but a lull before the storm.  One other thing.  It appears the Republicans fail again.  As a group they have the longest turn-around to seeing a reduction in lost labor.  In fact, the recent Bush years could be considered the longest lasting recession ever based on my PWU metic.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/blog/_archives/2008/4/17/3644448.html">Len Burman</a> and <a href="http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/blog/_archives/2008/4/20/3650536.html">Douglas Holtz-Eaton</a> exchange views with Len leading off assisted by Greg Leiserson who estimate the cost of McCain’s proposed tax cuts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even with the loophole closers, these proposals would reduce federal revenues by about $5.7 trillion over ten years if they could be enacted immediately.  Under a more realistic assumption that they don’t take effect until October 2009, the cost would be about $5.4 trillion … Cuts this size would pare government back to levels not seen since the Eisenhower administration. In FY 2012, tax revenues would be reduced by about $550 billion compared with current law (with the tax cuts expired). That is roughly equal to CBO’s baseline projection for all nondefense discretionary spending. McCain’s proposal is $300 billion bigger than all of President Bush’s FY2012 tax cut proposals. Tax revenues would be about 16.8 percent of GDP. By comparison, spending this year is about 20 percent of GDP … These estimates make one thing clear. Senator McCain plans a radical downsizing of government. Slashing pork, earmarks, and underperforming programs would offset only a fraction of the revenues. Cuts the size of those he proposes will require slashing discretionary spending and entitlements, and probably even reining in defense spending. Small wonder he has backed away from his earlier pledge to balance the budget—meaning that these tax cuts, like the ones signed by President Bush, will be paid for by our children.</p></blockquote>
<p>Douglas goes on the offensive again by trying to suggest the above is somehow misleading.  His first argument is really not an argument at all:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the broadest level, the problem is that the Center focuses on taxes in isolation, while the impact of Senator McCain’s proposal must take into account changes on the expenditure side as well. He has proposed specific discretionary cuts to offset the historic practice of waste and earmarks, a one-year discretionary “pause” (freeze) of spending outside of necessary military and veterans accounts, an overall program review that would encompass defense procurement plans and methods and non-defense programs, and a comprehensive health care reform that is the foundation for addressing the budgetary stresses from entitlements.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the discussion from Burman and Leiserson did consider the expenditure side.  Then there is this bait and switch:</p>
<blockquote><p>The scoring is dramatically influenced by the adoption of unrealistic congressional  budgeting conventions.  An analysis grounded in sound economics would evaluate the impact of tax and spending proposals that change the current course of policy … In contrast, the Tax Policy Center uses the congressional baseline, which reflects current law and not current policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>If this sounds all too confusing, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/">Paul Krugman</a> is here to help:</p>
<blockquote><p>Holtz-Eakin’s reply involves, in part, claiming that the proposals are a “vision” rather than something to be specifically implemented. Oh-kay. But what really got me was Holtz-Eakin’s complaint about “the adoption of unrealistic congressional budgeting conventions.” This takes some explaining. When “scoring” tax proposals, Congress asks how they would change revenue from what it would have been otherwise — that is, it’s done against a baseline of current policy. And current policy is defined as what the current law says.  Now, this has caused problems, largely because the Bush administration deliberately used that convention to hide the irresponsibility of its tax plans. The 2001 tax cut was scheduled to expire at the end of 2010, not because this was actually intended to happen, but to make the 10-year projected cost lower. And the Bush administration didn’t include the price of an AMT fix, even though it was clear one would be necessary. What Holtz-Eakin wants us to do is to consider all of this water under the bridge. The Bush administration faked its numbers by pretending that it wanted the tax cut to expire — but hey, they didn’t really mean it, so we shouldn’t consider extending the Bush cuts as something that imposes any new revenue loss. The Bush administration pretended that nothing needed to be done about AMT, but hey, everyone knows that was fraud, so we shouldn’t consider abolishing the AMT a real cost. So most of the McCain proposal isn’t really a tax cut! This is sophistry — and Holtz-Eakin knows it. Proposing to extend past unaffordable tax cuts has the same effect on the budget as proposing new unaffordable tax cuts. The bottom line is that the combination of the Bush tax cuts and McCain’s extensions and revisions would leave the federal government without sufficient revenue to do its job; no amount of bobbing and weaving can change that fact. And it’s really sad to see Holtz-Eakin lending his reputation to this sort of thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>McCain’s fiscal proposals are a recipe for a continuation of the escalation of the Federal debt to GDP ratio.  It is ashamed that the former CBO chief has decided to prostitute himself for this fiscal irresponsibility.</p>

<blockquote><p>McCain&#8217;s remarks prompted a response from Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan: &#8220;We want to take Senator McCain at his word that he wants to run a respectful campaign, but that is becoming increasingly difficult when he continually tries to use the politics of association and makes claims he knows not to be true to advance his campaign.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What’s Hari Sevugan referring to?  Let’s go back to the beginning of Eric’s post:</p>
<blockquote><p>The McCain camp has just blasted out a statement saying that Obama&#8217;s alleged &#8220;endorsement&#8221; by Hamas will &#8220;definitely be an issue in the election,&#8221; an indication that McCain intends to honor his promise of a &#8220;civil&#8221; campaign more in the breach than in the observance.  McCain spokesman Brian Rogers called the supposed endorsement by Hamas, something that McCain hit Obama for earlier today, &#8220;a legitimate issue for the American people to think about,&#8221; on the basis of Obama&#8217;s call for negotiations with Iran.  Rogers added: &#8220;It is not only responsible to raise these critical issues in this election, but it would be the height of irresponsibility not to have this discussion with the American people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And yes – this is being abused for <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/04/mccain_defends_campaign_email.php">fundraising</a> with no apologies from Team McCain.  And there is the <a href="http://www.townhall.com/Columnists/AmandaCarpenter/2008/04/25/mccain_blasts_ayers_in_blogger_call">William Ayers</a> matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republican presidential candidate John McCain called on his Democratic rival Barack Obama to apologize for having a relationship with domestic terrorist William Ayers in a conference call with bloggers Friday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, McCain has saddled himself with the Iraq War fiasco as well the good old supply-side silliness which amounts to spend&#038;spend and borrow&#038;borrow.  With a failed foreign policy and a disastrous fiscal policy as things he has to not only defend but promise to continue – how else could McCain ever hoped to garner a win in November besides rolling the dice that the 2004 Bush-Cheney campaign of fear and lies will work again.  If McCain continues to go down this road – not a single patriotic American should vote for him.  What a pathetic little man he has become!</p>

                                <p>It seems some folks think I’m bashing McCain a bit too much so let me point out – with the assistance of <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/04/mccain_defends_campaign_email.php">Eric Kleefeld</a> &#8211; where McCain stood up for one of the smears from his supporters:</p>
<blockquote><p>So much for John McCain&#8217;s promise of a &#8220;civil&#8221; campaign. In a conference call with bloggers today, McCain defended his campaign&#8217;s fundraising e-mail declaring that Hamas wants Barack Obama to win.  &#8220;All I can tell you Jennifer [Rubin] is that I think it&#8217;s very clear who Hamas wants to be the next president of the United States,&#8221; McCain said. &#8220;So apparently has Danny Ortega and several others. I think that people should understand that I will be Hamas&#8217;s worst nightmare &#8230; If Senator Obama is favored by Hamas I think people can make judgments accordingly.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Atta boy John!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/191401.php">Josh Marshall</a> has a quote from Kevin Flynn of the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers proving John McCain is an elitist who is out of touch with average workers:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was at the legislative conference when McCain lost his cool and began this tirade. Your readers are correct, his assertion was that no American would be willing to do this work for $50.00 an hour. There are those who will argue that offering such a wage to American workers would not be adequate incentive, but clearly to an audience of construction workers this is not the case. Our president was behind him on stage when he made this asinine comment in response to the public outcry he received because of his very vocal support of comprehensive immigration reform, Our president (and myself since I worked in the field as well) was struck dumb because our members (not unlike those of the other trades represented in the crowd) work 8-12 hours each day in the heat throughout the country bending over and laying 80 lb concrete blocks, heavy stone &#038; marble, brick, and working in hellish conditions worse than the Arizona summer. Your original point was correct, John McCain is clueless when it comes to the economy or the experiences of ordinary people who work for a living. His only working experiences were as a pilot in the Navy and as a member of the House of Representatives and the Senate. It should be very apparent from this ludicrous offer he made to people doing similar work and in a fair number of states for less.</p></blockquote>

<p>One, the average duration of unemployment was much higher in this cycle then it was in the 1990s cycle.  This is in line with all the other data showing the recent cycle to be weak by historic norms.</p>
<p>Two, the most recent drop in the median duration of employment implies to me that the odds of a  recession are falling.</p>
<p>Do others reach the same conclusion?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24305534">Jonathan Weisman</a> documents how McCain has flip-flopped a lot on fiscal policy.  I thought this one was interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>In December 1994, after his party swept to control of Congress on tax-cut promises, he challenged Ronald Reagan&#8217;s legacy when he warned, &#8220;I think we would be making a terrible mistake to go back to the &#8217;80s, where we cut all of those taxes and all of a sudden now we&#8217;ve got a debt that we&#8217;ve got to pay on an annual basis that is bigger than the amount that we spend on defense.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that was a principled statement but isn’t he currently proposing to go back to Reagan’s spend&#038;spend and borrow&#038;borrow fiscal policy?  Alas, the dumbest comment comes from Douglas Holtz-Eaton:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;He&#8217;s looking forward, not back,&#8221; said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, McCain&#8217;s senior policy adviser.</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking forward, my crystal ball sees an ever rising Federal debt to GDP ratio.  In other words, McCain and Holtz-Eakin are shamefully proposing an unsustainable fiscal policy.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/jonathan-weisma.html">Brad DeLong</a> read this part more carefully than I did:</p>
<blockquote><p>To supporters, McCain has simply seen the light and now understands the power that business tax relief has to spur economic growth and innovation. Said J.D. Foster, a former Bush White House and Treasury tax policy expert, now at the Heritage Foundation: &#8220;It&#8217;s logical that he wouldn&#8217;t be repeating the arguments he made then. We all learn from experience.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>First time I have ever seen anybody describe J.D. Foster as a tax policy &#8220;expert.&#8221; Lobbyist, yes. Apparatchik, yes. Ideologue, yes. But expert?</p></blockquote>
<p>In case you are wondering, here’s the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/jdfoster.cfm">Heritage Foundation</a> bio for J D. Foster.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Within the Leading Index report there are series  on the concurrent and lagging index. One component within these releases is a monthly estimate of unit labor cost in manufacturing.  It is not the most reliable economic indicator and is subject to major revisions, but right now it is sending some very interesting information.</p>
<p>It implies that first quarter productivity growth is strong in manufacturing at least, which supports the various estimates that first quarter real GDP growth will be positive.</p>
<p>Moreover, the spread between manufacturing unit labor cost and the PPI is a major driving force explaining nonfinancial corporations profits growth.  This data strongly suggest nonfinancial corporate profits are rebounding strongly in early 2008 and that in turn implies that the chances that the US is now in a recession are very low.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SBHvDngv8DI/AAAAAAAAANk/OkAaB0HLA7c/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SBHvDngv8DI/AAAAAAAAANk/OkAaB0HLA7c/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Of course a big share of this spread is due to higher oil and food prices that negatively impact consumer spending and create a different set of pressures implying weak or recessionary growth.</p>
<p>In addition  one reason that stronger profits implies a stronger economy is because it means that corporations will spend these profits on new capital additions and this will sustain the economy.<br />However, a major portion of these profits are going to the energy companies and as this data on Exxon shows the oil companies are not spending their profits on additional drilling and exploration this cycle.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SBH1B3gv8FI/AAAAAAAAAN0/gcWhhTycvkc/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SBH1B3gv8FI/AAAAAAAAAN0/gcWhhTycvkc/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Interestingly in the 1970s oil price surge the oil majors spent every penny they could beg, borrow or steal on new exploration and drilling. So in contrast to what economic theory implies, maybe what we need to do is reimpose price controls on oil to induce the oil companies to spend their profits on drilling rather then higher dividends.</p>

                                <p>Reader T-bone states the theory well: (lifted from comments cactus style)</p>
<p>The bottom 50% are seeing no increase in real income while the dollar falls and their costs rise. Fiscal policy of low fed rates and heavy borrowing are being used to stimulate growth, and the negatives are being deemed an acceptable sacrifice. I believe the reason we need to resort to this fiscal policy is because supply side economics is having the opposite intended effect. Concentrating gains at the top is not resulting in a trickle down, even as productivy increases. However the negatives inherent in this necessary fiscal policy to compensate for the attempted free lunch is how the lower 50% are paying for the cuts in high income and capital rates. They&#8217;ll also pay in the future as neglected infrastructure will need government investment.</p>
<p>And as PGL eluded to, when the federal government cuts funding to the state level or cuts federally funded programs leaving the state to pick up the slack, state governments have to either raise taxes/fees or cut the services that benefit the people.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>&#8220;I am willing to listen to rational explanations on how raising taxes on any wage group improves the lowest bracket. The increased tax receipts that you are advocating go directly to the Treasury. It is a little bit like claiming to help a starving man by denying the rich guy on the hill a steak.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s more free lunch thinking. Increased tax receipts do not go to some vacuum in the treasury. Someone&#8217;s got to pay for spending, now or later. Even printing money would mean you pay for it through inflation. We can have people pay into SS and have the goverment borrow that money for general uses instead of keeping a balanced budget. But then when it comes time to pay back those SS money, where&#8217;s it going to come from? Are they going to tax those who paid into it a 2nd time in the form of general taxes, or are they going to have them pay for it through inflation, or what? 1+1 still equals 2. No free lunch.</p>
<p>Taxing a high income group certainly does help a low income group, assuming that tax increase prevents an equal amount of borrowing, or that tax is spent on something that benefits the low income group directly or indirectly, or it prevents a tax from having to be collected on that group. Seems silly that this needs to be explained.<br />===============<br />This lifted from comments, written by reader T-bone.</p>
<p>Rdan here: MA has or will have about fifty towns voting on &#8220;tax overrides&#8221; of the mandatory 2.5% limit on year to year increases in the property tax rate. The trickle down effect of unfunded mandates to the local level is creating havoc with local funding in this state.</p>
<p>The cap itself was put in place to mandate local votes on tax increases for a town. How are your towns doing?</p>
