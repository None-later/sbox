                                <p>Why does <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/08/life-expectancy-as-measure-of.html">Greg Mankiw</a> think <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/why_the_us_ranks_low_on_whos_h.html">John Stossel</a> knows anything about economics:</p>
<blockquote><p>But there&#8217;s less to these studies than meets the eye. They measure something other than quality of medical care. So saying that the U.S. finished behind those other countries is misleading.  First let&#8217;s acknowledge that the U.S. medical system has serious problems. But the problems stem from departures from free-market principles. The system is riddled with tax manipulation, costly insurance mandates and bureaucratic interference. Most important, six out of seven health-care dollars are spent by third parties, which means that most consumers exercise no cost-consciousness. As Milton Friedman always pointed out, no one spends other people&#8217;s money as carefully as he spends his own.  Even with all that, it strains credulity to hear that the U.S. ranks far from the top. Sick people come to the United States for treatment. When was the last time you heard of someone leaving this country to get medical care? The last famous case I can remember is Rock Hudson, who went to France in the 1980s to seek treatment for AIDS. So what&#8217;s wrong with the WHO and Commonwealth Fund studies? Let me count the ways. The WHO judged a country&#8217;s quality of health on life expectancy. But that&#8217;s a lousy measure of a health-care system. Many things that cause premature death have nothing do with medical care. We have far more fatal transportation accidents than other countries. That&#8217;s not a health-care problem. Similarly, our homicide rate is 10 times higher than in the U.K., eight times higher than in France, and five times greater than in Canada.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stossel links to a 215 page study and he takes one aspect out of the study to ridicule.  Life expectancy is one factor to look at but clearly it is not the only factor that the WHO and other studies consider.  Stossel should realize this if he bothered to read these studies.  And as he bashes the WHO, he offers no evidence in return for his suggestion that the US health care system is not as inefficient as others claim.</p>
<p>But you say he did acknowledge that we could do better.  OK – and his policy is what?  Getting rid of insurance?  The mind boggles.</p>

                                <p>This post looks at charitable giving over time, and, in particular, broken out by Presidential administration. Because I recently had a post on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-regular-church.html">regular church attendance</a>, and because religious contributions are a very big percentage of charitable contributions in general, the post also shows religious charity as a percentage of total charity.</p>
<p>The data on charity used in this post is the data used by <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2007/2007-012.pdf">Thomas A. Garrett and Russell M. Rhine</a> of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in their recent working paper entitled <em><strong>Does Government Spending Really Crowd Out Charitable Contributions? New Time Series Evidence</strong></em>. </p>
<p>The data was kindly provided by Thomas A. Garrett in private correspondence. Because the data comes from their paper, because their paper is fascinating in its own right, and because results have some bearing on this post, I’d like to spend a moment on some points raised by their paper.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. The causality tests … reveal that government spending does not cause charitable giving, but that charitable giving causes government spending. This suggests that past studies may not be capturing a causal relationship between government spending and charitable giving, but rather they are just capturing a significant correlation between the two variables. </p>
<p>2. First, we find strong evidence that a change in wealth, as measured by the S&#038;P 500, has a positive and significant effect on all categories of charitable giving. </p>
<p>3. Weak evidence is provided that changes in GDP and marginal tax rates effect charitable giving. Year-to-year changes in GDP have a positive and significant effect on charitable contributions to education only, thus providing some evidence that charitable contributions to education are procyclical. </p>
<p>4. Of all contribution categories, the evidence suggests that only education giving is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and taxes. </p>
<p>5. Finally, the coefficient on the recession dummy variable is only statistically significant in the models of charitable giving to education…. on average, charitable contributions to education are 0.51 to 0.53 percentage points higher during a recession year relative to non-recession years. This supports the idea that budget cuts or reductions in spending growth during recessions may entice more contributions to education if the public fears education services will be reduced. This again reflects the sensitivity of education giving to changes in economic conditions. </p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to data used by Garrett and Rhine, in this post I also use GDP from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">BEA’s NIPA Table 1.1.5</a>.</p>
<p>OK. Now for some graphs….</p>

<p>Garrett and Rhine’s notion that charitable giving is tied to increases in the economy and income goes some way toward explaining the results… but not all the way, when you look at things by administration. The fact that charitable giving saw its second highest increase under GHW doesn’t fit with increases in charity being correlated with increases in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">real GDP per capita</a> or <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/this-post-looks-at-disposable-income-by.html">disposable (and after change in debt obligation) real income</a>, but those variables, especially the second one, do seem to make sense in explaining the order in which the other Presidents appeared in the sample. What’s up with GHW? I have no idea. I would note that the result is basically due to the big jump from Reagan’s last year to GHW’s first year, and otherwise, there isn’t anything that would indicate there was such a big increase in giving during the GHW years. One other notable factor… as in many of these series we’ve looked at so far, things haven’t gone so well in the GW administration.</p>
<p>In any given case, given the tight relationship between real disposable income (after accounting for increases in debt) and charity, it would seem that the easiest way to get people to give more is to make them richer. Whether in general the wealthy give more to charity than the poor or not, on the other hand, I cannot answer. </p>
<p>Now, another point. I had a few posts pointing out that in my opinion, many donations to religious organizations are <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/liberals-conservatives-charity-and.html">very different from charity</a> regardless of how the law treats them. I realize that not all readers agree, but I think its supported by the facts. Regardless, the biggest jumps in religion’s share of the charity dollar have occurred under GW, Reagan, and Carter. Arguably, these are the Presidents most associated with faith in the public mind. So it may be that the President’s bully pulpit influences how charitable dollars get allocated.</p>
<p>Next post in the Comparing Presidents series… it just occurred to me, I haven’t looked at the stock market!</p>

<blockquote><p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney Tuesday stepped up his ongoing attack on cities with what he calls sanctuary policies for illegal immigrants &#8211; including rival Rudy Giuliani&#8217;s home city &#8211; with a new radio ad set to air in crucial campaign states Iowa and New Hampshire.  &#8220;Immigration laws don&#8217;t work if they&#8217;re ignored,&#8221; the ad&#8217;s announcer states. &#8220;That&#8217;s the problem with cities like Newark, San Francisco and New York City that adopt sanctuary policies. Sanctuary cities become magnets that encourage illegal immigration and undermine secure borders.&#8221;  The two GOP front-runners have been locked in a war of words over the issue after Romney claimed Giuliani supported illegal immigration while mayor. Giuliani has repeatedly denied the charge, arguing instead he cracked down on illegal immigrants while mayor.  Giuliani has repeatedly denied the charge, arguing instead he cracked down on illegal immigrants while mayor.  A Giuliani aide fired back at Romney Tuesday, criticizing him for hiring a landscaping firm that employed illegal immigrants to work at his home.  &#8220;Gov. Romney&#8217;s ad conveniently forgets that his plan to deputize state troopers that never went into effect did absolutely nothing to cut down on the number of illegals working in his yard,&#8221; a Giuliani aide said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hope his plan to secure the borders is more effective than that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>You won’t often hear me praising the Lou Dobbs position on this issue as we disagree 100%.  Dobbs love to shout “illegal” when he refers to people as “aliens”.  But these people are indeed children of God (for our atheist readers, my apologies for injecting my Christian beliefs here but I have to) and the only reason reprehensible assholes like Lou Dobbs can shout illegal as that our immigration laws (the ones that flip-flop Mitt touts) are a mess.  </p>
<p>But my point is not to trash Mr. Dobbs as at least he is consistent.  We know where he stands even if we don’t always agree with him.  These two Republican clowns have been serially flip flopping on just about everything.  So why should I be surprised that they pander to whatever group they appear before on an issue as trivial as the lives of human beings (aka “aliens”)?  After all – this unfortunately has been standard faire for the leaders of the modern Republican party.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.secinfo.com/dS997.34fn.d.htm">CuraGen</a> offers toxigenomic screens.</p>
<blockquote><p>CuraGen&#8217;s industrialized Predictive Toxicogenomics Screen enables inexpensive cellular screening of thousands of compounds annually, and provides results on nine different modes of liver toxicity. Evidence of liver toxicity is one of the primary reasons that drug compounds fail during preclinical development. Nearly 75% of pharmaceutical research and development expenditures are devoted to developing drugs that never reach the market. Detailed information generated by this screen can be used by scientists to prioritize compounds based upon their potential for toxicity, in order to avoid work on compounds that are likely to fail in safety tests later in development.</p>
<p>CuraGen and Bayer scientists developed this unique assay by analyzing more than 100 known toxic compounds and identifying marker genes whose activity correlates with specific modes of liver toxicity. These genes have been subcategorized into<br />marker sets predictive of nine specific liver histopathologies, including cholestasis, necrosis, or hypertrophy, and have been affixed to gene expression microarrays for use in high-throughput comparative analysis. Drug compounds under review are applied in extremely small quantities to primary hepatocyte cells in vitro. The cellular activity of these dosed compounds is then evaluated against the proprietary toxicity markers. The results of this comparison provide scientists with a rank-ordered list of compounds based upon their potential for toxicity, which can be used in determining which compounds have the highest likelihood for successful clinical development.</p>
<p>CuraGen Corporation has been a pioneer in the field of pharmacogenomics, which includes the study of how drugs work, why drugs fail, and which characteristics are indicative of drug toxicity. CuraGen&#8217;s expertise stems from pharmacogenomic research conducted with many of the world&#8217;s leading pharmaceutical companies in prioritizing portions of their drug pipelines.</p>
<p>CuraGen Corporation (NASDAQ: CRGN) is a genomics-based pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>More thoughts:</p>
<p>1) Is there a moral obligation of private companies to invest in public health as part of their own product development? If the current regulatory structure is not even knowledgeable about the issue as part of the public forum, is this wise?</p>
<p>2) In light of the US experience with Chinese products and safety, is it useful to wait for the EU regulations on cosmetics to take effect in the US instead of being more pro-active? Revlon and L&#8217;Oreal have volunteered to comply with EU rules and also sell the same to the US, but other companies have not, so known toxins remain in the market.</p>
<p>3) How do you see the balances of interests happening in the future?</p>
<p>More thoughts?</p>

<p><a href="http://nymag.com/news/businessfinance/bottomline/35813/">This</a> is the best summary I&#8217;ve seen of something significant happening in our economy <em>right now</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>You&#8217;re losing money right now. This very minute. You&#8217;re losing money if you own an apartment. You&#8217;re losing money if you own a country home. You&#8217;re losing money if you own a stock or bond mutual fund. You&#8217;re losing money if you have a pension plan. You&#8217;re probably losing money here or there, you&#8217;re probably losing money everywhere (except maybe from your savings account and wallet). But this is no Dr. Seuss story. It&#8217;s more of a John Steinbeck tale, and we are the victims, a new generation of Tom Joads, and it&#8217;s the damn bankermen who broke us. No, there won&#8217;t be a police officer to investigate, and the government, at least this federal government, won&#8217;t save us.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Where did the money come from? Banks lent it, mortgage brokers lent it, and even home builders themselves got into the act. The housing markets were so hot the lenders barely had time to check if their buyers were deadbeats, cheats, speculators, or actual honest-to-Betsy hardworking people who wanted nothing more than what Tom Joad wanted 70 years ago. Oh, and the buyers didn&#8217;t have time to check out the terms, either; the value of the houses was going up too fast. Gotta close now! Nor did the regulators tap the brakes; whoops, there were no regulators. If something went wrong, who cares? The buyers could always sell their ever-appreciating home to the next guy on the reservation list or the ten after him. The builders, brokers, and bankers then shipped these mortgages east to the big Wall Street firms, which bundled them together and merchandised them as high-yielding bonds often backed up by nothing more than the full faith and credit of, well, no one.</p></blockquote>
<p>I disagree with the author (I doubt it&#8217;s really Cramer) in blaming Greenspan and the regulators.  Bubbles seem to be an unfortunate product of free markets/capitalism.   Amazingly, I don&#8217;t think there is partisan blame here either.</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pakistani Intelligence ISI in collaboration with Iranian intelligence crafted a unique strategy to fight Baloch nationalists who are waging a deadly guerilla warfare against Pakistani Army in the Balochistan province &#8211; Islamize youth and kill Nationalists &#8211; according to sources in Balochistan . Baloch Nationalists have alerted Western Governments and think tanks abroad about this new development; witnessed by locals, widely circulated in baloch forums, that a promotional gathering of Tabligi was orchestrated under the watchful eyes of ISI on July 31 in Gawadar, the costal city Balochistan. One Mr.Archen Baloch said &#8220;Fanatic mullahism is been promoted proactively in collaboration with insignificant, discarded local mullahs against the Baloch nationalism which seeks the restoration of its national sovereignty over Balochistan. “. This phenomenon suggests that Pakistani intelligence is adding a new dimension to its Counter insurgence strategy to contain Baloch nationalists- who are regarded as secular, unlike other groups. IntelliBriefs sources in Pakistan say such events are &#8220;taking place in all over Balochistan, and this phenomenon suggest a new conspiracy against Baloch nationalist&#8221; and is also considered as &#8220;second force of Pakistani government after its armed force”.</p>
<p>While one need not be surprised about strong alliance between ISI and Islamic groups ,it is believed that ISI has activated its network of Mullahs to counter Baloch Nationalists after the failure of Pakistani army to crush the Baloch Resistance . Now Pakistan &#8221; wants dilute the intensity of Baloch nationalism by mobilizing the religious elements in our society&#8221; said Archen Baloch . All these activities are funded by ISI and spearheaded by Mr.Mulana Sherani ,member of Pakistan national assembly and he heads JUI in Balochistan .</p>
<p>On Iranian side of Balochistan ,Abdolmalik Rigi&#8217;s open revolt against Iran has forced Iranians to use Mullahs as weapons against Baloch Nationalists . Iranian officials are spending sleepless nights over the unrest in its Sistan Balochistan Province which shares border with Pakistani side of Balochistan . Sources say Baloch are facing harassment by Iranian officials at the border who visit their relatives on the other side of the border in the Iran . They say &#8220;we have to go through harsh security by Pasdarane Inqalab, the Revolutionary Guard.&#8221; . IntelliBriefs learned that those who want to participate in religious gathering in Pakistani held Balochistan face no restrictions, they can pass the boarder without any document or &#8220;Rahdari&#8221; permit.</p>

<blockquote><p>The families of the Crandall Canyon miner&#8217;s aren&#8217;t the only ones raising questions about the handling of the rescue effort.</p>
<p>Many news organizations and blogs are also now asking questions about the governments role and the man chosen to lead the rescue effort, Mine and Health Safety Administrator, Richard Stickler. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Increasing attention is now being paid to Stickler, the federal government&#8217;s main mine man. </p>
<p>Stickler used to be a mining executive who &#8211; according to various media reports &#8211; ran mines which had several fatalities and &#8220;&#8230;an incident rate that was often twice the national average.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Also coming to light, is the fact that Stickler&#8217;s nomination to head the mine administration was twice rejected by congress and rejected when republicans were still in charge. </p>
<p>Rejected reportedly by senators who were concerned about Stickler&#8217;s safety record when he operated mines. </p>
<p>After his nomination was twice rejected by the Senate, President Bush gave Richard Stickler the mine safety job with a recess appointment. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>A Republican nominee by a Republican President rejected by a Republican Congress? How incompetent was this guy?</p>
<p>ABC News now notes it took the mine safety administration two days to take public control of the Crandall Canyon Mine. </p>
<p>ABC also adds, &#8220;Others were irate that [mine owner Bob] Murray was allowed to publicly predict success and contradict MSHA itself while agency officials quietly looked on.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>This business of putting incompetent people in charge of things is like a theme for this administration, isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;ve said it before, I&#8217;ll say it again&#8230; this administration is qualitatively different from any previous one I remember. And when the people at the very top are so incompetent that they cannot recognize the difference between quality and crap, they tend to fill their organization with other incompetent people. So we end up with incompetent people being in charge of a range of things, from planning a war to running the economy or being National Security Advisor or being in charge of the USDA or FEMA. Now, most of these things more or less run themselves to some degree, but every so often, not having someone who knows what&#8217;s going on in charge makes one heck of a difference.</p>

                                <p>This post looks at the percentage of people who claim to regularly attend church every week or every other week, and as I’ve been doing for other series, I’m break things out by Presidential administration. </p>
<p>This is an unusual post for my series on Presidents since its not collected by the government, or which I found in the Statistical Abstract of the United States (and which therefore have an imprimatur of “good data” from the US government), but its tough to find data on religious affairs in the US. The government seems to go out of its way not to collect such data. </p>
<p>I used data from the American National Election Studies (thanks to reader Debbie for the pointer) – data is collected every two years, around election time. Data from 1952 to 1968 is <a href="http://www.electionstudies.org/nesguide/text/tab1b_5a.txt">here</a> and data from 1970 to 2004 is <a href="http://www.electionstudies.org/nesguide/toptable/tab1b_5b.htm">here</a>. Unfortunately, the questions asked changed… It does seem that Church attendance “every week or every other week” in the second set matches up with “Regular Church attendance” in the first set – there don’t seem to be structural breaks in the years the questions were changed. Otherwise, how accurate is the data? Well, who knows? And it is self-reported.</p>
<p>So with those caveats in mind, here’s a graph…</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RsowrTQR8_I/AAAAAAAAAnI/A-aQV0VcM6Q/s1600-h/Church+Graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RsowrTQR8_I/AAAAAAAAAnI/A-aQV0VcM6Q/s320/Church+Graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And a table to match&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RsowlTQR8-I/AAAAAAAAAnA/LgFAYvRu4tI/s1600-h/Church+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RsowlTQR8-I/AAAAAAAAAnA/LgFAYvRu4tI/s320/Church+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>From this, it seems that regular church attendance is decreasing in the US. Whether its an issue of people becoming less likely to attend religious services on a regular basis, or more comfortable owning up to not attending religious services on a regular basis, or becoming less comfortable owning up to attending religious services on a regular basis, or some combination of the three, its hard to say. The percentage of people claiming regular church attendance rose only during Ike’s and GHW’s term… Lord only knows, given how <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RmMDSSSzEFI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/Cc2cWmLCQcg/s1600-h/b+cycle+and+presidents,+table+1.jpg">poorly the economy performed</a> during those administrations, a lot of people <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/this-post-looks-at-disposable-income-by.html">really needed faith</a>. And perhaps they got what they prayed for&#8230; after all, JFK/LBJ and Clinton were the administrations that seemed to perform better on economic measures from increasing real GDP per capita to increasing real median income. </p>
<p>Regular church attendance held steady under Carter… it may (or may not) have something to do with him being perceived as a religious guy himself. Otherwise, the percentage of people claiming regular church attendance declined the most under JFK/LBJ, then GW, and then Clinton. </p>
<p>So… from this, it really doesn’t seem like most Presidents have much to do with whether the population becomes more religious, even if one or another President had such an effect. Certainly, those professing to bring more morality into the public sphere don’t seem to add much to the public&#8217;s religious zeal. It also doesn’t seem like an increase in self-reported religious service attendance makes much difference when it comes to whether or not a President whose views are more acceptable to most of the more religious folks gets elected. </p>
<p>If anyone knows where I can get more time series data on religious issues, please let me know. Meanwhile, I think the next post in this series will be on charitable giving.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://iwpr.net/?p=icr&#038;s=f&#038;o=337687&#038;apc_state=henh"> Reporters at the Institute for War and Peace Reporting</a> offer insight into local political and military conditions in Basra.  Reporting appears to dovetail with Cactus&#8217;s post.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The concrete walls that surround the Fadhila party&#8217;s compound in Sharish, north of Basra city centre, resemble the barricades around the fortified Green Zone in Baghdad. Last spring, fierce clashes erupted between Fadhila and the Mahdi Army, a paramilitary group loyal to radical Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Several people were killed on both sides and offices and buildings belonging to the two parties were destroyed. Mediators from tribes and other political parties managed to end the fighting but as Abu Ali al-Baaj, a mid-level Mahdi Army commander, put it, &#8220;The tensions were not buried for good.”</p>
<p>The reason for the battle was simple &#8211; as the governing party in Basra, Fadhila had replaced the head of the local electricity department, who happened to be a Sadr supporter. Behind the façade of democratic institutions such as councils and the police force, Iraq’s second-largest city with about 2.6 million inhabitants, has fallen into the grip of competing militias who are as suspicious of one another as rival mafia families. When the two militias began fighting over the post of electricity chief, the police force divided into factions which turned their weapons on one another. Police cars were used to transport militia members. The Fadhila party runs the provincial council of Basra and controls most of the government institutions there. It was founded after Saddam Hussein&#8217;s regime was toppled in April 2003, and holds 15 seats in the Iraqi parliament.</p>
<p>With leading Shia cleric Sheikh Mohammed al-Yaqubi as its spiritual leader, the party also features Basra’s governor Mohammed al-Waili among its leading members. Basra had so little to lose and so much to gain from the demise of Saddam Hussein’s regime that, initially at least, it had all of the makings of a post-liberation success story. The city had been neglected for at least a decade as punishment for its largely Shia population’s support for the 1991 rebellion against Ba’ath party rule.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Whichever party wins, residents fear they will be the losers. Many say all they want is decent public services and accountable officials.&#8221;The religious parties and coalitions plant fear and terror among people to make sure they keep their mouths shut,&#8221; said Ahmed al-Hassawi, a traffic policeman. &#8220;This creates a terrorised community that can’t hold officials accountable even when they make mistakes. “I don’t care about the name or approach of the party that runs the province &#8211; my concern is what they will provide for my children and me.”However, Basra could be set for another bout of turbulence well ahead of any election. After Maliki dismissed Governor Waili, the Fadhila party threatened to mount protests on July 30. The protests were called off at the last minute, apparently after the party received assurances that Waili’s replacement would again be drawn from its ranks rather than from some rival group. </p></blockquote>

<p>Its grim&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p>we are skeptical of recent press coverage portraying the conflict as increasingly manageable and feel it has neglected the mounting civil, political and social unrest we see every day. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>Yes, we are militarily superior, but our successes are offset by failures elsewhere. What soldiers call the “battle space” remains the same, with changes only at the margins. It is crowded with actors who do not fit neatly into boxes: Sunni extremists, Al Qaeda terrorists, Shiite militiamen, criminals and armed tribes. This situation is made more complex by the questionable loyalties and Janus-faced role of the Iraqi police and Iraqi Army, which have been trained and armed at United States taxpayers’ expense. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>Reports that a majority of Iraqi Army commanders are now reliable partners can be considered only misleading rhetoric. The truth is that battalion commanders, even if well meaning, have little to no influence over the thousands of obstinate men under them, in an incoherent chain of command, who are really loyal only to their militias. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>However, while creating proxies is essential in winning a counterinsurgency, it requires that the proxies are loyal to the center that we claim to support. Armed Sunni tribes have indeed become effective surrogates, but the enduring question is where their loyalties would lie in our absence. The Iraqi government finds itself working at cross purposes with us on this issue because it is justifiably fearful that Sunni militias will turn on it should the Americans leave.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>The ability of, say, American observers to safely walk down the streets of formerly violent towns is not a resounding indicator of security. What matters is the experience of the local citizenry and the future of our counterinsurgency. When we take this view, we see that a vast majority of Iraqis feel increasingly insecure and view us as an occupation force that has failed to produce normalcy after four years and <em><strong>is increasingly unlikely to do so as we continue to arm each warring side</strong></em>. </p></blockquote>
<p>(bolding and italicizing mine)</p>
<blockquote><p>At the same time, the most important front in the counterinsurgency, improving basic social and economic conditions, is the one on which we have failed most miserably. Two million Iraqis are in refugee camps in bordering countries. Close to two million more are internally displaced and now fill many urban slums. Cities lack regular electricity, telephone services and sanitation. “Lucky” Iraqis live in gated communities barricaded with concrete blast walls that provide them with a sense of communal claustrophobia rather than any sense of security we would consider normal. </p>
<p>In a lawless environment where men with guns rule the streets, engaging in the banalities of life has become a death-defying act. Four years into our occupation, we have failed on every promise, while we have substituted Baath Party tyranny with a tyranny of Islamist, militia and criminal violence. When the primary preoccupation of average Iraqis is when and how they are likely to be killed, we can hardly feel smug as we hand out care packages. As an Iraqi man told us a few days ago with deep resignation, “We need security, not free food.” </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>This suggestion is not meant to be defeatist, but rather to highlight our pursuit of incompatible policies to absurd ends without recognizing the incongruities. </p>
<p>We need not talk about our morale. As committed soldiers, we will see this mission through. </p></blockquote>
<p>I would add two things&#8230;<br />1.  This isn&#8217;t news to anyone paying attention.  Heck, here at AB, I myself have written all of this before.  Ad nauseum.  But as the old saw goes, there are none so blind as those who will not see.<br />2.  These soldiers know what happened to Generals who spoke up. They know what is going to happen to them. And they chose to step forward anyway. That, ladies and gentlemen, is guts and honor and integrity. Someone remind me again&#8230; why is it wrong to call someone a Chickenhawk if they insist the war in Iraq must go on, and that they are doing their part by &#8220;fighting the war of ideas&#8221; out here? (Well, other than <a href="http://tbogg.blogspot.com/2007/08/mouthpiece-i-dont-know-if-this-is-trend.html">this reason</a>.)</p>
