<p> Still haven&#8217;t filed your FBAR? Don&#8217;t wait till you get hit with forfeiture like this Alaska Plastic Surgeon  </p>
<p>It looks like the leads from the various voluntary disclosures are beginning to pay off, as the U.S. is beginning to develop high stakes cases related to Americans who have tried to maintain secret caches of cash offshore&#8211;to hide from the taxman and from their ex-spouses! The forfeiture complaint in the case, filed Feb. 9, 2012 in California&#8217;s Central District, is available <a href="http://www.assetprotectionbook.com/casedocs/brandner/001_Complaint_09feb12.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The government seized $4.656 million belonging to Michael and Sheila Brandner (he&#8217;s the plastic surgeon) from an account at Bank of America in the name of Evergreen Capital LLC, an entity set up by Brandner and under his (hidden) control. The government&#8217;s tale is a sordid one&#8211;In the middle of Brandner&#8217;s divorce proceedings in May 2008, he drove to Panama where he deposited checks worth about $3.5 million in a non-US bank, with the purpose of concelaing the assets from his soon-to-be ex-wife. A person who became a &#8220;cooperating witness&#8221; helped him open the account and told him about the FBAR requirement, but Brandner didn&#8217;t file the required report. A few months later, Brandner transferred an additional $1.4 million, mostly from his pension fund, to that account (also to conceal it from his wife. The pension fund was awarded to his wife in the divorce proceedings, and when Brandner learned that the Panama account might be susceptible to discovery, Brandner moved the money through wire deposits in 2011 into the Bank of America account of Evergreen Capital, allegedly to conceal it from the IRS and from his ex-wife.</p>

<p>As the Atkinson story notes, this mess was doubly stupid. It was stupid of the surgeon to try to cheat his wife of assets and it was really stupid to do it in a way that could well ultimately subject him to criminal charges. See Jay Atkinson, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jayadkisson/2012/03/17/brandner-alaska-plastic-surgeon-faces-forfeiture-of-4-656-million-for-undisclosed-offshore-account-used-to-attempt-to-cheat-ex-wife/">Brandner: Alaska Plastic Surgeon Faces Forfeiture Of $4.656 Million For Undisclosed Offshore Account Used To Attempt To Cheat Ex-Wife</a>, Forbes (Mar. 17, 2012). Anybody else that is still waiting out there with millions in an undeclared offshore account, watch out. The time to file and pay up has arrived.</p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/03/more-on-greg-mankiws-weak-arguments-for-the-bain-capital-gains-preference.html">More on Greg Mankiw&#8217;s weak arguments for the Bain capital gains preference</a></p>
<p>A few days ago, I commented on the weak arguments Greg Mankiw had put forth in his op-ed to support the preferential treatment of compensation for private equity and real estate partnership &#8220;profits&#8221; partners. He points out the categorization problem&#8211;that it is not always easy to be sure what is a &#8220;capital gain&#8221; and what is &#8220;ordinary income&#8221;. I concluded along the lines of arguments I have repeatedly made on this blog: the main thing the categorization problem teaches us is that we should eliminate categorization problems that create inevitable inequitable differentiations by eliminating the category difference.</p>
<p>Get rid of the preferential rate for capital gains (and with it the need to distinguish capital gains from ordinary income), and you will in one stroke simplify corporate and partnership and individual taxation tremendously. Much of the Code is invested in trying to prevent smart tax lawyers from using tax alchemy to convert one type of income into another. See, e.g., section 1059 (extraordinary dividends to corporate shareholders), section 304 (sales between affliated corporations treated as redemptions), section 302 (providing tests that, if not satisfied, treat redemptions as dividends if there is e&#038;p), etc.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Uwe Reinhardt makes a similar argument in the Economix blog carried by the New York Times. See <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/capital-gains-vs-ordinary-income/">Capital Gains vs. Ordinary Income</a>, New York Times Economix Blog (Mar. 16, 2012). Reinhardt uses Mankiw&#8217;s own introductory textbook in microeconomics to make the tax equity argument that many have been making about carried interest&#8211;it is unfair to tax a money manager at a preferential rate compared to firemen, postal inspectors, college professors, school teachers and neurosurgeons.</p>
<blockquote><p>In his popular textbook “<a href="http://www.swlearning.com/economics/mankiw/mankiw3e/micro/mankiw3e_micro.html">Principles of Microeconomics</a>,” Professor Mankiw teaches students that “horizontal equity states that taxpayers with similar ability to pay should contribute the same amount.” Well put.</p>
<p>Consider now a person who bought a vacation home for $500,000 and two years later, during one of our recurrent real-estate bubbles, sells it for $1.5 million. That $1 million profit is now taxed at a rate of only 15 percent. If the home had been the principal residence of this person and his or her spouse, half of the $1 million profit <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/real-estate/capital-gains-home-sale-tax-break-a-boon-for-owners-1.aspx">would not be taxed</a> at all.</p>
<p>Suppose next that this tax-favored person’s neighbor were a busy neurosurgeon whose many hours of hard, physical and intellectual work earned him or her a net practice income of $1 million during those same two years. That neurosurgeon would pay the ordinary income-tax rate on that income (on average a bit less than 35 percent, because only income over $388,350 a year is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/moneybuilder/2011/09/30/2012-federal-income-tax-brackets-irs-tax-rates/">taxed at 35 percent</a>).</p>
<p>By what definition of the term would can one call the glaringly differential tax treatment of the real estate investor and of the neurosurgeon horizontally equitable?</p></blockquote>
<p>Reinhardt goes on to make another of the arguments that I have been pressing for months in this blog&#8211;that the assertion that preferential rates are necessary for stock market transactions because they are rewarding investment in the corporations is baloney&#8211;most reported gains on securities are from secondary market trades, not from direct investments in corporations.</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he proponents of lower capital-gains taxation conjure up an image of, say, Jones purchasing shares of stock directly from the issuing corporation, which then invests the proceeds in new structures and equipment.</p>
<p>More typically, however, sales and purchases of corporate common stock take place among parties quite outside of the issuing corporation. For example, Jones may buy the stock from Chen, who may have reaped a capital gain from once buying and now selling the stock. Chen may have bought the stock from another person not related to the issuing company.</p>
<p>When Jones pays Chen, it is anybody’s guess what Chen does with the money. For all we know, Chen will spend it on a luxury car. Why, then, should any gain Chen enjoys on his or her investment in that stock be granted a tax preference? No new capital formation was supported by this trade in a stock sold by the company years ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ugly truth about the insistence on the capital gains preference is that it rewards people at the top of the income and wealth distribution and serves to maintain the status quo of the allocation of resources. This is what is really meant by &#8220;fiscal conservatism&#8221; these days&#8211;ensuring that resources remain inequitably distributed to the very wealthy who are the &#8220;shakers and movers&#8221; of society through the influence their money can buy. The right-leaning Supreme Court has made that even more inevitable than it was before, through the Citizens United decision upholding the right of corporations to contribute any amount to influence political campaigns, based on the laughable assertion that such &#8220;super-PAC&#8221; rights undergird free speech.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/10418-focus-the-santorum-strategy">George Lakoff</a> offers a clear opinion on an important aspect of how people learn from election and media presentations.  There are a lot of examples of reporting and the concept is clear enough.   However, it is an entirely different proposition when applied to real life in posts or comments&#8230;for instance, how posts are written, for what audience, and what sort of learning is actually being encouraged:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Republican presidential campaign is not just about the presidential race. It is about using conservative language to strengthen conservative values in the brains of voters &#8211; in campaigns at all levels from Congress to school boards. Part of the Republican strategy is to get liberals to argue against them, repeating conservative language. There is a reason I wrote a book called Don&#8217;t Think of an Elephant! When you negate conservative language, you activate conservative ideas and, hence, automatically and unconsciously strengthen the brain circuitry that characterizes conservative values.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>As I was writing the paragraphs above, the mail came. In it was material from Public Citizen (an organization I admire) promoting Single Payer Health Care (which I agree with) by arguing against right-wing lies about it. In big, bold type the lies were listed: <strong>Single payer is socialized medicine. Single payer will lead to rationing, like in Canada. Costs will skyrocket under single Payer</strong>. And so on. After each one, came the negative: Wrong. And then in small, unbolded type, the laundry lists of policy truths. Public Citizen was unconsciously promoting the conservative lies by repeating them in boldface and then negating them.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The same naiveté about messaging, public discourse, and effects on brains is now showing up in liberal discussions of the Republican presidential race. Many Democrats are reacting either with glee (&#8220;their field is so ridiculously weak and wacky.&#8221; &#8211; Maureen Dowd), with outrage (their deficit-reduction proposals would actually raise the deficit &#8211; Paul Krugman), or with incredulity (&#8220;Why we&#8217;re debating a woman&#8217;s access to birth control is beyond me.&#8221; &#8211; Debbie Wasserman Schultz). Hendrik Hertzberg dismissed the ultra-conservatives as &#8220;a kick line of clowns, knaves, and zealots.&#8221; Joe Nocera wrote that he hope Santorum would be the Republican candidate, claiming that he is so far to the right that he would be &#8220;crushed&#8221; &#8211; an &#8220;epic defeat,&#8221; &#8220;shock therapy&#8221; that would bring back moderate Republicans. Democrats even voted for Santorum in the Michigan primary on the grounds that he would be the weaker candidate and that it would be to the Democrats&#8217; advantage if the Republican race dragged on for a long time.</p>
<p>I mention these liberals by name because they are all people I admire and largely agree with. I hope that they are right. And I hope that the liberal discourse of glee, scorn, outrage, incredulity, and support for the most radical conservative will actually win the day for Democrats at all levels. But, frankly, I have my doubts. I think Democrats need much better positive messaging, expressing and repeating liberal moral values &#8211; not just policies- uniformly across the party. That is not happening.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Lifted from comments from <strong>Linda Beale&#8217;s</strong> post <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/03/graphs-show-it-clearly-richest-are-much.html" target="_blank">Graphs Show It Clearly&#8211;the richest are much richer and most of us are poorer</a> discussing the main points and data from <strong>David Cay Johnston&#8217;s</strong> Reuters article <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/2012/03/15/the-richest-get-richer/" target="_blank">The richest get richer</a> is Bruce Webb&#8217;s thinking on how the American market system was designed over time:<br />Defenders of Goldman who base that defense on &#8220;greed is good&#8221; reductionist understanding of capitalism are simply ignoring the legal and I would say moral structure in which banking and management were embedded: that of fiduciary responsibilities and principal/agent law.</p>
<p>Before Glass-Steagal repeal (and similar legal and business culture changes dating back to the fifties) there was an understanding that commercial bankers had a fiduciary responsibility to their customers,that the relation in question was one of agent to principal. And the same for management, managers were agents of the owners whether directly in a private firm, or indirectly via the Directors of either a joint-stock company or as in insurance of a mutual structure where policy holders were &#8216;owners&#8217;. On the other hand investment banks ad law firms and reinsurance companies like Lloyd&#8217;s and it&#8217;s &#8216;Names&#8217; we&#8217;re generally set up on a partnership basis where the agents were principals, at least at top levels.</p>
<p>  But that distinction broke down, maybe as early as the rise of the Conglomerate and the Multinational where the link between the manager/agent and the principal/owner the principal/mutual holder became attenuated to the point of near nonexistence with the result that what had been agents, say a plant superintendent, now reported to an executive suite at &#8216;Corporate&#8217; where one-time agents were de facto principals. As exemplified by the bastard blend of President and Chairman of the Boardand Chief Executive Officer into a single person whose theoretical agency relation to ownership was at best mediated through a board of Directors often largely serving under his direction.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />     And this attenuation of Agent-Principal relations broke down entirely when Glass-Steagal and other actions simply smushed together the partnership and joint-stock/mutual models where the formal and legal structure remained the latter even as the decision making went with the former.</p>
<p>   Thus Goldman-Sachs Corporate culture. Instead of maximizing profits for the partners on one hand or for the shareholders on the other and all while maintaining a fiduciary responsibility to the customer/depositor, the executives and traders, who in law are simple hired help, i.e agents promoted themselves in their own minds to principals. Something complicated by the fact that various forms of stock based compensation made certain top executives both de facto and de jure principals quite beyond their selected/elected Chairman/CEO/President blended position. </p>
<p>     This obviously needs some polish, it is a blog comment after all, but I think I am on to something, something I have been bouncing around in my mind since I first took a course on Post WWII American History back in the early eighties,  that is post multi-national conglomerate but prior to the barrier break represented by Glass-Steagal repeal. That is we are seeing a confluence of several streams that have mostly reduced all notions of fiduciary responsibilities and/or principal-agent law into a fetishizing of maximizing individual self-interest as if every trader at G-S was in the same legal and moral position as a medieval chapman selling goods from his pack purchased with his own money from the producer.</p>
<p>    So yes capitalism is organized around the principle of principals maximizing their self-interest. But not everyone is, or should be considered,a principal. And no &#8220;Well duh, capitalism equals maximizing return&#8221; does not in itself wipe out the entire legal and moral structure that grew up around it. Agency and fiduciary responsibilities still are or should be operative. That is you don&#8217;t get to operate Wall Street on the principle &#8220;We eat what we kill&#8221; no matter what some hot-shot MBA trader might think.</p>

<p>  On the 23rd the Obama administration will publish the administrative regulations for Medicaid expansion.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.medicaid.gov/Federal-Policy-Guidance/Downloads/REG-03-16-12.pdf">http://www.medicaid.gov/Federal-Policy-Guidance/Downloads/REG-03-16-12.pdf</a> </p>
<p>As reported by Modern Healthcare, eligibility will be simplified to an income test as a percentage of the federal poverty level. This may expand Medicaid by as many as 17 million recipients by 2016.  There are a number of administrative issues addressed, many focused on simplifying and streamlining processing.</p>

<p>Two three-year-olds walk up to a marble-delivery machine that has two bins. Each stands in front of one bin. Three scenarios:</p>
<div>1. One bin has three marbles in it, the other has one: the winner is unlikely to share to equalize the takings.</p>
</div>
<div>2. There are two ropes to pull; one delivers one marble, the other three: the winner is unlikely to share to equalize the takings.</p>
</div>
<div>3. Two ropes, but both must be pulled <em>together</em> to deliver the one/three marbles: the winner is <em>likely</em> (75%!) to share to equalize the takings. (Either spontaneously, or on request from the loser.)</p>

<p>If people feel that they <em>must</em> work together to get the goods, they also feel that they should (or even <em>want to</em>) share the goods.</p>
<p>Haidt’s take (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote><p>If there’s a <strong>problem with the ultra-rich,</strong> it’s not that they have too much wealth, it’s that <strong>they bought laws that made it easy for them to gain</strong> and keep so much more wealth in recent decades. </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Sarah Palin gave a speech last September lambasting “crony capitalism,” which she defined as “the collusion of big government and big business and big finance to the detriment of all the rest – to the little guys.” I think that she was on to something and that she was right to include big government along with big business and big finance. The problem isn’t that some kids have many more marbles than others. <strong>The problem is that some kids are in cahoots with the experimenters. They get to rig the marble machine before the rest of us have a chance to play with it.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Now add this:</p>
<p>The losers <em>know</em> the game is rigged, so their innate intution tells them that the winners should share.</p>
<p>The winners refuse to know that the game is rigged — deny it vehemently — so they think the losers are unreasonable in their expectations of sharing.</p>
<p>Contributing: The American cult of individualism — the widespread belief among the successful that their success is a result of their efforts only, so they <em>deserve</em> their winnings — means that their natural human work-together-share-together instincts aren’t invoked. This even when they’re wrong about the relative contribution of their individual efforts.</p>
<p>So the winners are deluded about two things: 1. the relative contribution of their individual efforts (compared to A. luck and B. the rules/playing field), and 2. the (rigged) state of the playing field.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem: the losers are <em>also</em> deluded about #1 (because the rigged game provides the winners with the necessary resources to delude them through tens of billions of dollars of propaganda and economist-buying).</p>
<p>So here’s the rhetorical challenge faced by those who seek greater equality: convince the losers that much or most of the winners’ success is in fact the result of everyone pulling on ropes together (and luck), <em>not</em> just the winners’ industrious rope-pulling. Not an easy task, but one worth focusing on.</p>
<p>To add, a problem with Haidt’s analysis: if big business and big finance (and rich people) couldn’t buy big government to rig the game in their own favor, big government wouldn’t be the problem. <em>Absent that buy,</em> government is essentially indifferent to relative distributions — or arguably even more inclined to sharing the wealth widely to garner lots of votes — one person one vote versus one dollar one vote.</p>
<p>He suggests a three-way symmetry for a situation that is not symmetrical.<br /><em><br /></em><br /><em>Cross-posted at <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=5216">Asymptosis</a>.</em></p>

<p>Graphs Show It Clearly&#8211;the richest are much richer and most of us are poorer </p>
<p>David Cay Johnston has employed a couple of key graphic images that tell a significant story about the way that US laws have favored the rich&#8211;including tax administrative procedures that have reduced real audits of the rich and tax laws that have cut the top rates significantly and cut the rates on the &#8220;favorite&#8221; form of income of the rich to extraordinarily low rates.  See David Cay Johnston, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/2012/03/15/the-richest-get-richer/">The rich get richer</a>, reuters (Mar. 15, 2012) (noting that the figures he uses here, in 2010 dollars, are from an analysis of IRS data by Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty). [hat tip Francine Lipmann and Tax Prof]<br />
<blockquote>The 1934 economic rebound was widely shared, with strong income gains for the vast majority, the bottom 90 percent.<br />In 2010, we saw the opposite as the vast majority lost ground. National income gained overall in 2010, but all of the gains were among the top 10 percent. Even within those 15.6 million households, the gains were extraordinarily concentrated among the super-rich, the top one percent of the top one percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>So while the Great Depression acted as a leveler, the cascading impact of tax and other fiscal policies that are extraordinarily favorable to the rich was little influenced by the Great Recession.  Here&#8217;re the two telling graphs from the article.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="369" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/files/2012/03/US_AVGINCOMES0312_SC.jpg" title="US_AVGINCOMES0312_SC" width="540"></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Johnston notes that the story in numbers for adjusted gross income is discouraging: <br />
<blockquote>Saez and Piketty show that the vast majority’s average adjusted gross income, of which wages are just a part, was $29,840 in 2010. That was down $127 from 2009 and down $4,842 from 2000.<br />Most shocking? The average income of the vast majority of taxpayers in 2010 was just a smidgen more than the $29,448 average way back in 1966.<br />At the top, the super-rich saw their 2010 average income grow by $4.2 million over 2009 to $23.8 million. Compared to 1966 their income was up on average by $18.7 million per taxpayer.</p></blockquote>
<p>The graphic illustration shows just how much the inequality we see today is from the richest of the rich getting an indecent proportion of income growth. </p>

<p>Is this a problem that needs fixing?  Yes, it clearly is.  We have long recognized the importance of a society where everyone takes part and everyone has at least the minimum essentials for a decent life and a chance for improvement. </p>
<p>A society where a very few &#8220;elite&#8221; at the top garner all the benefits of the system and more and more of the income for themselves is not a sustainable society&#8211;the top becomes predatory, willing to take gains no matter what the cost to everyone else.  It is the kind of attitude that many who are familiar with Wall Street banks have criticized as endemic to Wall Street culture&#8211;and one that was revealed even more starkly by the resignation from Goldman of a star banker who publicly criticized the current culture at Goldman that believes in profits for the firm at the sacrifice of the good of the customer.  See Greg Smith, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html">Why I am Leaving Goldman Sachs,</a> New York Times Op-Ed (Mar. 14, 2012).  Shareholders obviously agree with Smith that the &#8220;profit for the firm above care of the client&#8221; mentality is wrong.  See Christine Harper, Goldman <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-15/goldman-stunned-by-op-ed-loses-2-2-billion-for-shareholders.html">Roiled by OpEd Loses 2.2 Billion for Shareholders</a>, Bloomberg (Mar. 15, 2012). </p>
<p>[Goldman is worried&#8211;I got a release from a PR firm suggesting that Goldman&#8217;s profit-making is a boon to the economy and gives its clients great trust in the firm.  I read it and thought&#8211;hmm, misses the point.  Smith isn&#8217;t condemning profit-making per se.  He is condemning profit-making at all costs, and in particular the &#8220;greed is good&#8221; type of profit-making that creates conflicts of interest with the client that is purportedly being served but would as soon eat a client as eat a steak, if money could be made for the firm (and the trader&#8217;s bonus) that way.]</p>
<p>If we want the kind of society that gives everyone a chance to have a decent education, we have to quit running down public schools and diverting public monies to support private religious schools.   Hold schools accountable, but quit the wasteful focus on testing and assessment.  Do a little assessment and a lot more teaching.</p>
<p>If we want a more equal society, then we have to change our tax laws so that they don&#8217;t favor the rich over everybody else.  Reduce the interest deduction, so that leveraged buyouts aren&#8217;t a way to take a stable working company, make a huge profit by borrowing, and then dump it (either in bankruptcy or out of it, but nonetheless yoked with the debt that got the private equity firm rich).  Get rid of provisions that are primarily beneficial to the wealthy&#8211;reinstate a hefty estate tax, eliminate the preferential rate on capital gains, reinstate the phase out of deductions at high income levels, increase the top income tax rate (let the Bush tax cuts lapse in toto or at least for the top earners), phase out the accelerated depreciation schedules, bonus depreciation and expensing provisions, and otherwise return our tax system to a saner progressive model that can support the important basic research at universities and basic public infrastructure development that are the real keys to economic growth.<br />The right has bamboozled the public with its tiresome but endless class warfare rhetoric pushing corporatist policies that claim that tax cuts for wealthy corporations and wealthy individuals are the way to boost growth and help the majority of Americans have good jobs and decent wages.  It&#8217;s a lie.  The way to do that is by moving to a more progressive tax system and providing more government funding for basic research (NIH, NSF, etc.) and for public infrastructure (mass transportation, rails throughout America and its inner cities, urban development). </p>

<p>Does the US Corporate Saving Rate Portend a Lower Unemployment Rate? An interesting thing happened in Q4 2011: the corporate saving rate declined following two quarters of gains. Nominal net saving by the domestic business sector fell 3%, while nominal gross fixed investment and inventories surged 6% – the two pushed the saving rate down nearly 40 bps to 2.94% of GDP. The corporate saving rate (gross saving less gross investment) has been on a downward trend since the end of 2009, a welcomed trend by the labor market.</p>

<p>There’s a very strong correlation between the corporate saving rate and the unemployment rate, 80% according to a simple bivariate OLS regression. I’ve <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/03/its-not-structural-unemployment-its.html">argued in the past</a> that there is some causation to this relationship – but that’s not the point of this post. The point here is that the trend in corporate saving has fallen sufficiently to portend some material declines in the unemployment rate in coming quarters….ALL ELSE EQUAL. For example, a simple bivariate regression would forecast a 7.5% unemployment rate if the corporate saving rate falls another 30 bps to 2.6%.</p>
<p>The all else equal is important. The primary driver of this quarter’s decline in the corporate saving rate was the 6% increase in nominal investment spending, the largest quarterly gain since 2010 Q2. Amid relatively weak manufacturing orders and the expiration of the depreciation allowance, I expect that this momentum is unlikely to be matched in coming quarters. Will firms start drawing down nominal saving to finance new hires?</p>
<p>Better put: will the unemployment rate drop to meet the saving rate? Or will the saving rate rise to meet the unemployment rate?</p>
