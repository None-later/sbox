<p>Public Transit Benefit was down, is now up again (in Senate)</p>
<p>One of the tax provisions that lapsed last year was a very popular tax expenditure supporting public transportation&#8211;a tax credit for commuters using mass transit was allowed to lapse back to a $125 monthly benefit from the stimulus level of $230 a month.  Ironically, in a time of clear importance environmentally of cutting back on cars and increasing use of public transit, Congress had given preferential treatment to support for parking (likely supporting most those commuters at the higher end of the income scale who like to drive their BMWs from Connecticut to New York City, or commuters who don&#8217;t have decent access to public transit):  the parking subsidy actually increased to $240 a month.</p>
<p>Today, the <a href="http://mobile.nationaljournal.com/congress/senate-passes-109-billion-transportation-bill-20120314">Senate passed the Surface Transporation Reauthorization Bill </a>(see summary, <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:SN01813:@@@D&#038;summ2=m&#038;">here</a>; for text and other actions, see <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.01813:">S.1813 </a>on Thomas).  The bill as passed included a provision, retroactive to Jan first of this year when credit lapsed to the lower level, that would restore the public transit credit at the same level as the current parking subsidy.  See PR Newswire, Senate <a href="http://m.prnewswire.com/news-releases/senate-approves-increase-to-pre-tax-benefits-for-public-transportation-commuters-142680105.html">Approves Increase to Pre-Tax Benefits for Public Transportation Commuters</a>, Commuter Benefits Work for US.org (Mar. 14, 2012).  The House may delay action on the bill though Boehner has said he would call the Senate version for a vote if the GOP majority doesn&#8217;t agree on an alternative.  See Linda Scott,  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/03/senate-passes-transportation-bill.html">Senate Passes Transportation Bill</a>, PBS NewsHour (Mar. 14, 2012).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to see Congress moving to correct this.  As Sen. Lautenberg noted<br />
<blockquote><strong>“Mass transit boosts the economy, reduces dirty auto emissions and takes cars off our congested roads. We fought hard to include this provision in the bill so that transit riders can enjoy the same benefits as drivers. I&#8217;m pleased that this bill finally appears poised for Senate passage, and I urge the House to follow suit and approve this bill immediately.&#8221; Lautenberg: <a href="http://www.politickernj.com/55516/lautenberg-increased-transit-rider-tax-benefit-would-help-thousands-new-jersey-commuters">Increased transit rider tax benefit would help thousands of New Jersey commuters </a>(Mar. 13, 2012).  </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Favoring cars over public transit didn&#8217;t make sense except as just another example of the way tax expenditures favor high income taxpayers generally&#8211;the real face of class warfare in the U.S.A. today.  <br />(Though of course, it goes to show that it is much easier to get some kind of tax break through Congress these days&#8211;in spite of the right&#8217;s whining about needing to cut spending&#8211;than it is to enact a reasonable program with expenditures specifically targeted at the purpose  intended.  This is why Obama&#8217;s corporate tax proposal provides a scattershot corporatist oriented reduction in corproate tax rates for &#8220;manufacturers&#8221;, instead of doing what we should do, which is leaving the corporate tax statutory rate where it is, and providing an incentive program for corporations that bring significant numbers of new jobs back to the US.)<br />If you don&#8217;t believe my point about <strong>class warfare</strong>, just look at the way the balance works out between beneficiaries of the various programs that the right likes to refer to as &#8220;entitlements&#8221; and wants to cut, versus the beneficiaries of numerous tax expenditures in the Code that the right seems endlessly willing to extend, increase, and rationalize. </p>
<p>The result is a general pattern of reallocation of resources in ways that amount to<strong>redistribution upwards to those already at the top of the income distribution</strong>.  Looks a lot like rewarding rich Congressional cronies while punishing the poor, the elderly and the vulnerable.  See, e.g.,  Eduardo Porter, A<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/business/a-nation-with-too-many-tax-breaks-economic-scene.html"> Nation With Too Many Tax Breaks</a>, New York Times (Mar. 14, 2012), at B1 (and, off topic but relevant given  Rush Limbaugh&#8217;s despicable slurring of the Georgetown student advocating for full coverage of contraception under the Health Care law, notice that Reagan&#8217;s signing of the 1986 tax reform act was in the middle of a slew of older white males&#8211;not a female in the picture!).  The article compares the distribution of federal benefits (programs like unemployment, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, housing assistance, and food stamps, but not Pell grants or Veterans Benefits) to the distribution of tax expenditures (exemptions, deductions and credits like the preferential rate on capital gains, the home mortgage interest deduction, and the deduction for charitable contributions). </p>
<p>The federal benefits are much more evenly distributed, though the primary benefit does go to those in the lowest two quintiles (as intended by the nature of the programs).  The bottom 40% of taxpayer families by income group get about 60% of the program benefits.  But the tax expenditures&#8211;all those goodies built into the Code through crony capitalism&#8211;go much more disproportionately to those at the very top of the income distribution:  the top 20% get a whopping 67% of the benefit of tax expenditures, with the second highest quintile getting an additional 14%, adding up to 81% of the benefit going to the top 40% of the income distribution (and this spread may undercount, since it compensates for generally larger taxpaying units in the top income layers).  The lowest 40% get only 11% of the tax expenditures. </p>
<p>There is a good graphic for this, that you can access through <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/03/13/business/Who-Gets-the-Breaks-and-Benefits.html?ref=business">this link</a>.</p>

<blockquote>There has been an ongoing discussion in the econoblogosphere about the usefulness or lack thereof of “microfoundations” in macroeconomics, which in practice means trying to write down models in which aggregate behavior is justified in terms of the actions of utility-maximizing individuals with rational expectations.<br /> &#8230; </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But bear in mind what we’ve actually seen in academic economics: the development of an ethos in which only microfounded models are considered “real” theory, in which it’s basically impossible to publish a paper unless it’s intertemporal optimization all the way. That’s the kind of dominance a theory is only entitled to if it produces dramatically better predictions than the theory it has crowded out<br />&#8230; </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Wren-Lewis says he disagrees, but as <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/03/very-rude-comments.html">Robert Waldmann says</a>, his examples offer <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2012/03/what-have-microfoundations-ever-done.html">very thin gruel</a>. The failure of the commodity price shock to filter into wider inflation? Lots of people predicted this without any appeal to microfoundations, just the observation that wage contracts were no longer indexed and oil as a share of GDP was lower than in the 70s. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The basic picture is that we’ve seen a more or less complete takeover of macro by an approach that hasn’t remotely earned the right to that kind of dominance.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2012/03/thursday-roundup-3152012.html" target="_blank">Noah Smith</a> at <i>Noahpinion</i> has an impressive listing on Thursday&#8217;s Roundup of the many involved in the conversation:</p>
<blockquote><p>This week in econ: A bunch of people are talking about philosophy-of-macroeconomics, which I like&#8230;things like microfoundations, rational expectations, bounded rationality, learning, and untested hypotheses. This is just my kind of nerdery! Elsewhere, people are arguing about monetary policy even more than usual. It&#8217;s another day in the ER&#8230;er&#8230;econosphere.. </p></blockquote>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Mark Thoma and Simon Wren-Lewis both responded to a complaint about the rational expectations assumption by noting that they had colleagues who study boundedly rational learning.  I see a third alternative &#8212; giving up.  That is, we might conclude that we don&#8217;t understand expectations formation and that we won&#8217;t for a long while, so we should just decide that economic agents believe the darndest things.   This implies giving up on calculating a conditional probability distribution of future outcomes.  One way to implement the just throw in the towel strategy is to say that there is a 90% probability that a model including the rational expectations hypothesis will predict the future as well as it fit the past and a 10% chance that something weird and unexpected will happen, because economic agents get some strange notion in their heads.</p>
<p>But what is my problem with boundedly rational learning ?  Well first of all actual learning is clearly monstrously complicated (especially when the learners get together and decide to teach each other).  Any model must be a gross simplification which might be a useful approximation and might not.  So we are back to maybe it will work ok and maybe not (and we don&#8217;t know the probabilities). </p>
<p>The worse problem is that the exact model of expectations formation typically matters a lot.  Equally plausible models can have extremely different implications. Equally plausible models which fit the same data equally well can have extremely different implications.  I provide an example.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>One model of boundedly rational learning is that agents choose a specification and estimate coefficients by OLS.  So far we have a really dumb model (like adaptive expectations) such that policy makers can fool all the people all the time.  But wait, the agents test their identifying restrictions &#8212; they consider alternative specifications one of which, with the right coefficients,  happens to be the optimal forecasting rule.  They switch specifications if the currently favored specification is rejected against an alternative specification at the alpha significance level.</p>
<p>This model has the desirable feature that you can&#8217;t fool all of the people all of the time, that is it has the desirable trait of the rational expectations assumption. </p>
<p>OK so an example of the example.  The monetary authority can set the inflation rate except with an iid noise term.  Agents set prices one period in advance based on their forecast of next period&#8217;s price level.  The monetary authority has an ambitious output target (wants to trick people into producing more than they would in the flexible price equilibrium).  Inflation is slightly costly. </p>
<p>If the agents have rational expectations, the best policy is to set inflation to zero.  I assume that the monetary authority can pre-commit, so it would do that.</p>
<p>Now assume agents are the pick a specification and keep it until it is rejected at level alpha against another specification (in a set including the specification which allows rational expectations).  Let&#8217;s say they start with the guess that inflation is a mean zero  white noise (so the best estimate is always 0).  So long as they stick to that specification, the old expectations un-augmented Phillips curve describes the economy.  </p>
<p>The monetary authority can hide in the noise and set inflation above zero for a while.  It will do this.  So what ?</p>
<p>Two things, one of which matters and the other of which is a mathematical joke.</p>
<p>Well first, I haven&#8217;t told you what alpha is, have I. I am sure that if such a model of boundedly rational learning is simulated alpha is set to 5%  cause that&#8217;s just the way we hang.  But what if it were ten to the minus tenth ?  In that case, the optimal policy might be to set expected output to the ambitious target for the next hundred years. The implications for policy are totally different than rational expectations for until we will all be dead.  In particular the implications for any data set we have are totally different.</p>
<p>The critique of models of expectations other than rational expectations is always based on arguments about what happens as t goes to infinity (when we will all be dead).  They don&#8217;t rule out different assumptions which have implications for all time up to 2012 or 2112 which are as different as implications can be.</p>
<p>Second, the optimal monetary policy contains a stochastic term.  The agents estimate the variance of the white noise disturbance to inflation.  If the monetary authority randomly changes it&#8217;s inflation target, it imposes second order costs.  It has a first order effect on the estimate variance of the disturbance term.  This allows it to hide longer under the noise. So the optimal amount of noise to add to inflation is positive.  </p>

                                <p>Simon Wren-Lewis gets me going again</p>
<p>He <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2012/03/rational-expectations-and-phillips.html">wrote</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>Rational expectations do not prevent us understanding sustained periods of deficient demand when an inflation targeting central bank hits a lower bound. Indeed they help, because with rational expectations inflation targeting prevents inflation expectations delivering the real interest rate we need, as I have argued here.</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>The traditional Phillips curve has always seemed to me to be an advertisement for the dangers of not doing microfoundations. It seems plausible enough, which is why it was used routinely before the rational expectations revolution. But it contains the serious flaw noted above, which almost destroyed Keynesian economics.</p></blockquote>
<p>After the jump, two very rude comments (in anti chronological order)</p>
<p>update: welcome Krugman readers.  Oddly I kept secret the really rude comment which attempts to support the thin gruel claim as made by Krugman (I e-mailed it to myself).  I think I will try to keep it secret (but I mean how the hell did Krugman know I had written a thin gruel comment ?  ) Anyway I put a semi almost not totally utterly rude version as a comment on his post and below so now there are 3 comments in anti chronological order.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>update:<br />the very rude comments I posted are nothing like the rude comment I decided to e-mail myself instead.  In particular, they don&#8217;t contain much of the thin gruel  claim. I think I will summarize the ones I didn&#8217;t post.</p>
<p>Wren-Lewis discussed changes in Central bank independence and explicit or implicit inflation targets.</p>
<p>When claiming one has evidence, one really can&#8217;t use the word &#8220;implicit.&#8221;   Explicit inflation targets are observable variables.  The claim that, without an explicit target, the Fed targeted inflation certainly isn&#8217;t an explanatory variable (and is hard to reconcile with FOMC minutes) .  I&#8217;d guess the conclusion that there was an implicit target is based on the fact that inflation stayed at roughly the same level.  If so, the evidence is that in cases where inflation stayed at roughly the same level, inflation stayed at roughly the same level.</p>
<p>There has been no change in the legal independence of the Fed.  Yet US inflation was high in the 70s and low in the naughties.   Again there isn&#8217;t a pattern relating observable variables with outcomes.  </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t add that 1973  -1968 = only 5 years.  In many countries, workers didn&#8217;t accept that they had to live with capitalists.  Unions were more powerful and vastly more militant.    One might ask if one can explain differences in inflation rates by looking at difference in labor movements.  For example, one might as Colin Crouch.</p>
<p>End update:</p>
<p>You write (suspected typo elided) &#8220;inflation targeting &#8230; delivering the real interest rate we need.&#8221;  I note that the ECB has consistently targetted inflation (at least you are willing to give inflation targetting credit for events in 2005 and 2006.  You must conclude that the Eurozone has the real interest rate we need.  </p>
<p>But the Eurozone suffered a severe recession, currently has extremely high unemployment and appears to be headed for a second dip. </p>
<p>I think you meant to qualify the claim with &#8220;with the right inflation target, assuming (for some reason) that the target is credible &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>I too have semi defended the rational expectations assumption recently.  However, the basic advantage I see is that the assumption of rational expectations makes it more difficult (not impossible) for people to tell stories about how their preferred policies are good, because (it is assumed rather than argued) they will influence expectations in a desirable way.  </p>
<p>Briefly, I think the point is to exorcise the confidence fairy.  Less briefly, my reasoning was that, if one is not required to assume rational expectations, one can argue that cutting spending will cause increased growth by increasing business confidence.  A model in which businessmen with rational expectations increase investment and production because of a spending cut is not easy to write.  My guess is that it would be a model with sunspot equilibria, so anything can change investment.  If so the case for expansionary austerity would be identical to the case that what we need is to burn incense to the flying spaghetti monster (which claim is consistent with the rational expectations assumption on models where sunspots can matter).  </p>
<p>The key question, I think, is not rational vs irrational. It isn&#8217;t even rational vs adaptive.  It is whether we should treat expectations as a policy variable imagining that policy makers can control them as they control, say, the federal funds rate.  </p>
<p>Then I thought &#8220;same for the people who think that expected inflation is just like the federal funds rate&#8221; and here we are.  I might add, I also thought &#8220;this time I won&#8217;t be very rude in comment&#8221; really honestly.  But, as I see it, you leave me no choice.</p>
<p>Look why not just talk about a monetary authority which targets real yearly GDP.  To a million pounds per capital  You are simply assuming that a central bank can get the inflation expectations it wants.  That rational people will believe its dynamically inconsistent promises.  </p>
<p>Oddly the last time I remember defending rational expectations was when I tried to explain (to Matthew Yglesias) why Paul Krugman was skeptical about the effectiveness of monetary policy right now. </p>
<p>I note again that you have not identified one advance new Keynesians have made beyond Keynes.  The alleged examples include speculation about UK consumption some of which, you note, is not incorporated into new Keynesian models yet and none of which has yielded an improved prediction and, of course, the old Phillips curve.  The only connection between the old Phillips curve and Keynes is that he warned against believing in it as clearly as anyone could writing before Phillips.</p>
<p>You contest Krugman&#8217;s claim that those who seek microfoundations have had no successes since the critique of the old Phillips curve yet you go back to that again and again.  I see no trace of a justification for your disagreement with Krugman in this post or in any other post of yours which I have read.</p>

<p>Illinois&#8217;s Tim Johnson (Rep.) Squirms under Norquist No-Tax-Increase Pledge  </p>
<p>Back in 2002, Tim Johnson represented a safely red district in Illinois and the radical right was pressing on his back with its reaganomics-inspired program to cut-taxes-to-shrink-(nonmilitary)-government-and-eliminate-public-infrastructure-and-social-justice-programs; de-regulate-to-free-up-big-business; privatize-wherever-you-can-especially-schools-bridges-and-other-essential-services.  Not to be outdone, Tim Johnson signed the no-tax-increase pledge on the dotted line, with his right-hand aide as witness.</p>
<p>In spite of the decades of extraordinarily well-funded anti-tax/anti-government propaganda spewed by purported think tanks like the &#8220;Americans for Prosperity&#8221; arm of the Koch Bros, the anti-estate tax &#8220;American Family&#8221; coalition arm of the Walton heirs, the Big-Business oriented Chamber of Commerce and Club for Growth and similar groups, the American public seems to be finally beginning to learn to read between the lines and recognize self-serving propaganda for what it is.    Even with all the money being spent to misrepresent and distort the truth about taxes, it is worth noting that Rasmussen polls (run by a leaning-right head) are finding Americans more willing to support tax increases than they were a few years ago.  For example, back in December 2011, despite the anti-tax nonsense of the Tea Party and other radical right-wing groups, only 52% thought tax cuts would help the economy&#8211;in the low end of the 51% to 63% range answering that question affirmatively since July 2008.  Similarly, a recent poll showed that <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/taxes/october_2011/47_favor_candidate_who_raises_taxes_on_wealthy_over_one_who_opposes_all_tax_increases">47% favor a candidate who wants to raise taxes on the rich </a>over a candidate who wants no tax increases.  Back in September 50% of Americans favored a mix of spending cuts and tax increases (but 64% weren&#8217;t willing themselves to pay higher taxes, a product of the NIMBY syndrome).  And a March<a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/taxes/march_2012/56_think_america_is_overtaxed"> poll found a significant decrease </a>in Americans responding who thought that America is an &#8220;over-taxed&#8221; nation. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>[N]ew Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 56% of Likely U.S. Voters believe America is overtaxed. But that’s down from 66% <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/taxes/april_2010/66_say_america_is_overtaxed">two years ago</a> and 64% <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/taxes/april_2011/64_say_americans_are_overtaxed_political_class_disagrees">last year</a>. One-out-of-three (33%) now believe the country is not overtaxed, while another 12% are not sure. (To see survey question wording, <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/questions/pt_survey_questions/march_2012/questions_taxes_march_7_8_2012">click here</a>.)</p></blockquote>
<p>[ASIDE:   The problem with the question about whether Americans are overtaxed&#8211;especially in this age of 527 groups spending buckets of money to convince them that they are&#8211;is that it depends on who you are asking and what facts they actually know about taxes, the economy, and what the difference is between effective tax rates and statutory rates.  Everybody hears the radical right prattle on about how high our (statutory) tax rates are.  Very few hear much about effective tax rates and fewer still understand the difference.  The wealthy are not over-taxed, though they have spent a good bit of their money to convince typical Americans that they are.  Those who escape federal income taxation because they earn amounts covered by the standard deduction and personal exemptions and earned income tax credits&#8211;amounts intended to keep lower income taxpayers from having to pay income tax&#8211;nonetheless have to pay signficant state and local property and sales (and often also income) taxes and have to pay significant federal payroll taxes.  Not surprisingly, they may well feel overtaxed when their wages are going down and their tax burden is staying the same and they hear the think tank spew of anti-tax stuff on the airwaves day and night.]</p>
<p>And now Tim Johnson&#8217;s district has changed.  He represents a more Democratic electorate, that is less likely to swallow the Tea Party tax aversion hook, line and sinker.  So he is backtracking.  Which is good. It&#8217;s a shame he backtracked bit by bit, at first claiming he&#8217;d never signed and then suggesting his aide signed for him before he finally admitted he had signed the pledge but just didn&#8217;t consider it cast in granite.   See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/are-you-now-and-have-you-always-been.html?emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y">Are you Now and Have You Always Been</a>?, New York Times editorial (March 11, 2012). </p>
<p>But to give him credit, he finally did take a  stand against the idiocy of the tax pledge.   See Pat Garofalo, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/03/08/440397/gop-rep-blasts-norquist-irresponsible/?mobile=nc">GOP Rep. Blasts Norquist&#8217;s Anti-Tax Pledge as &#8220;Disingenuous and Irresponsible&#8221;</a>, Think Progress.org (Mar. 8, 2012).  He ought to do it more straightfowardly&#8211;by admitting that it is a mistake to assume that tax cuts are always good or that tax increases are always bad and by acknowledging that there is plenty of room to tax the rich more without harming anybody&#8217;s economic recovery.  His statement (quoted on ThinkProgress) weasles by making clear that he is leery of tax increases other than fixing tax loopholes or raising the Social Security tax&#8230;..</p>
<p>One hopes that these few quasi- brave Republicans who are beginning to speak out against the idiocy of a &#8220;pledge&#8221; to cut off a key tax policy tool of democratic institutions for supporting public infrastructure and public needs will cause Norquist&#8217;s pledge to go to the same ignominious fate that awaited Joe McCarthy&#8217;s anti-liberal binge (under the name of anti-communism) when a lone lawyer questioned his decency.  As a constitutent told GOP representative Rick Berg in a North Dakota town hall meeting (quoted on Think Progress), these guys are supposed to work for their constituents, not for Norquist.</p>

                                <p>No it is not a guide to proper grammar, and I know perfectly well that a preposition isn&#8217;t the sort of thing I&#8217;m supposed to end a sentence with.</p>
<p>The case for assuming rational expectations rests on two valid arguments.  </p>
<p>1)  Expectations matter a lot.*<br />2) If you allow people to assume whatever they want about expectations, then you allow them to explain anything and nothing and predict anything they want (see the Confidence Fairy).</p>
<p>This leads to the conclusion<br />3) If we want to use models to prediction what will probably happen, we should assume rational expectations.  </p>
<p>The logic is not that actual agents actually have rational expectations, but rather that some discipline is needed to keep people from fiddling away until they have fit the past impressing the gullible but obtaining no ability to predict the future.  The rational expectations assumption just has to be the least bad well defined rigid assumption.</p>
<p>My problem with this argument is the hypothesis &#8220;If we want to use models to prediction what will probably happen&#8221;. Back in the bad old days, economists would use one set of (primitive) models for short term forecasting, but not at all assume that the factors they left out (left as disturbance terms) weren&#8217;t important.  This is still true of many economists.  </p>
<p>Some economists, however, clearly think that the models can be used to determine what might happen.  Indeed that if something couldn&#8217;t happen if the model were reality, then it couldn&#8217;t have happened even though it sure seems to have happened.  </p>
<p>My view is that, if we have to make simple assumptions about expectations, then the rational expectations assumption is the least bad assumption.  But if we don&#8217;t have to make such assumptions, as when we are asked if something might happen, we shouldn&#8217;t.  </p>

<p>One fan of the rational expectations hypothesis is named O.J. Blanchard.  He is a leading new Keynesian.  He has recently proposed a target inflation rate of 4% not 2%.  The logic is that, if we find ourselves in another deep crisis, it is better for central banks to be able to set the safe short term real interest rate to -4% rather than -2%.  He doesn&#8217;t have a model which predicts that there will be another deep crisis in say 2018.  He doesn&#8217;t need to.  All the argument requires is that we can&#8217;t rule out another deep crisis (or put a low upper bound on the probability) and that the cost of getting caught in a liquidity trap dwarfs the added cost of 4% inflation over 2% inflation.  </p>
<p>Over at the investment banks (including those who failed) they claim to practice &#8220;stress testing&#8221; where, even if a model suggests that a trading strategy will give high risk adjusted returns, they try to think about the lower tail &#8212; what would happen in the case of extreme events which haven&#8217;t occured in their data set but which might occur in the future.  </p>
<p>There doesn&#8217;t seem to me to be any stress testing of policy rules based on the idea that things might happen which can&#8217;t happen in the model and haven&#8217;t happened in the data set.  I think this is partly a consequence of ignoring the conditions for usefulness of the rational expectations assumption and that it has caused vast suffering.</p>
<p>*  On 1) surprisingly many new Keynesians seem prepared to argue that we have advanced beyond Keynes, because we have figured this out.  By Keynes they mean the old hydrolic Keynesian models which are very different from anything Keynes wrote.  I think I understand what is going on.  Krugman has been praising the IS-LM model.  They want to debate Krugman.  He is busy.  So they sometimes treat me as a junior varsity Krugman.  This is flattering, but it is not responding to my challenge to find something introduced to macro theory since Keynes which is demonstrably empirically useful.  The key point is that Keynes hedged his bets, so it is hard to take him to the cleaners.</p>

<p> Hey, didn&#8217;t the GOP say it cared about deficits?</p>
<p>  Just when you think those on the radical right had gone about as far as they could go without recognizing their own zaniness, those in Congress have revived their version of a tax &#8220;reform&#8221; for businesses.  It was first proposed in 2009&#8211;as an alternative to real stimulus spending on infrastructure .  And yes, it is yet another tax cut.  An even zanier one than the rest that they&#8217;ve come up with while at the same time whining of deficits and suggesting that longstanding social programs like Social Security and Medicare must be cut back.<br />Eric Cantor, in a memo last month to fellow Republicans, announced that the House would be putting this proposal forward&#8211;let every business with 500 employees or fewer deduct off the top 20% of their income.  And they want to pass this rot by the filing deadline&#8211;on the pretense that it will help ordinary folk.<br />See Richard Rubin, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2012/03/08/bloomberg_articlesM0JGMG6JTSF401-M0JGM.DTL">Hedge Fund Tax Break May Come in Republican Small Business Plan</a>, San Francisco Chronicle (Bloomberg News, Mar. 8, 2012).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Now, folks, there are some mighty BIG businesses with fewer than 500 employees.  Like just about every hedge fund and leveraged buyout fund. (The latter, of course, like to call themselves &#8220;private equity&#8221; these days&#8211;let&#8217;s people overlook the fact that they have destroyed many a stable, profitable business by loading them up with debt and sucking out all the cash while firing employees or making the business focus on paying back the debt and not on doing business).  Why would the GOP want to reward those funds with even more tax breaks than they already grab for themselves&#8211;carried interest, pass-through taxation, and the ability to avoid the payroll taxes since they treat their compensation as though it were an investment gain?  Because that is what they are all about&#8211;making sure the richest people in the country get all the breaks.</p>
<p>Then there are sports teams.  Liquor stores.  Golf courses. Gambling dens&#8230;.. Hotels. Restaurants.  Engineering firms. Accounting firms.  Law firms.  Architectural firms.  Big Business that normally make Big Money.<br />Just goes to show that the corporatist GOP never saw a tax break for the monied class that it didn&#8217;t like. </p>

<p>It is a little late for analysis of the employment report, so I&#8217;ll just post a couple of charts I had prepared to add this morning.  If you go back to old days before the great moderation, when everyone worked on the premise of a four year economic cycle one of the points we all accepted was that Presidents wanted to have their recession in the first year of their term so that it would be forgotten by the time they stood for reelection. The exceptions to this rule were Carter and Bush Sr. and they both lost their reelection bids.  But if you look at the Obama record with this analysis in mind his performance has not been out of line with other Presidents.</p>
<p>On the other hand if your major criticism of Obama is that he has acted like a Republican, this chart should just reinforce that view.</p>
