<p>Well surprising to me anyway. The 2009 Social Security Report projected a 75 year actuarial gap for combined OASDI of 2.00%. Between the structural change involved in changing the valuation period (as 2009 drops off and a new year 75 is added) and the current recession cutting into revenues I fully expected this gap to edge up. Instead it was revised down to 1.92% putting it back to where it was in 2001. Why the change? Well the following table breaks it down. As always, click to enlarge.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFr5AygPKZI/AAAAAAAAAYo/mbaa_vEJGVs/s1600/2010+II.D2+Reasons.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFr5AygPKZI/AAAAAAAAAYo/mbaa_vEJGVs/s400/2010+II.D2+Reasons.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Well it wasn&#8217;t because they gamed future economic and demographic projections (except one) the OACT left ultimate numbers unchanged. There were some changes in initial numbers due to high unemployment, but those were offset by changes in the Methods and Programmatic Data. Instead the biggest change is the +.14 due to Legislation offset by the -.06 due to the Valuation period to give our net change of +.08.</p>
<p>And what legislation was that? Health Care Reform. The OACT calculates that HCR will result in dollars being shifted from employer paid health insurance to wages after the Exchanges et al are fully in operation. This seems to rest on an argument from economic theory that has employers setting total compensation at some rate established by the underlying fundamentals and then backing out health care costs from that, with the idea that savings in the latter simply means more of the total flowing to wages. Well personally I have never been convinced by that argument, but in that I am in a decided minority, in particular most of the professional economists I know endorse it. So I guess I&#8217;ll just let it stand.</p>
<p>What are the policy implications of a steady state or dropping year over year 75 year actuarial gap. Well some thoughts under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Well the first thing it does is put the &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8221; folk in their place. Take the following table showing actuarial gap by Report year.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFr_MxECZpI/AAAAAAAAAYw/kKdGO4k_JAs/s1600/2010+VI.B1+Actuarial+Balance+by+year.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFr_MxECZpI/AAAAAAAAAYw/kKdGO4k_JAs/s400/2010+VI.B1+Actuarial+Balance+by+year.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />This table is found on page 153 and is accompanied by text explaining the specific changes that went into adjusting the number, but if we back up a bit we can see that after a fairly drastic surge between 1993 and 1994 the actuarial gap has, despite any attempt to adopt policy to address it, has stayed remarkable steady fluctuating around a mean of 2.0%. This is a little odd for two reasons, one is that the change in actuarial period represented here should have something like 0.7% to the accumulated total, that instead if anything that the trend has been modestly down suggest there is something in the model which is too pessimistic, and that this factor or factors, whatever they are, is enough to offset the accumulated change due to valuation period.</p>
<p>But even without trying to identify those factors we can come to a clear empirical conclusion: based on these numbers the clearly superior approach to Social Security (and the last entitlements commission-Kerrey-Danforth) in 1994 has been a plan of &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. Addressing Social Security in 1994 by cutting benefits or raising taxes would have been a straight give away by everyone who was either a worker or retiree in those years, instead all beneficiaries received full benefits and all workers got the equivalent of a 2%+ tax cut. And based on the results of the 2010 Report &#8216;Nothing&#8217; was also a perfectly fine plan for 2009, despite all the hysteria stirred up by &#8220;vanishing surplus, YEARS ahead of schedule, we got to act RIGHT NOW&#8221; the final numbers just show no support for that at all.</p>
<p>Now for those of us who want to avoid any future cut in benefits there is merit in putting in place a contingency plan that would have us move when the numbers actually support it. But those who want to use some theoretical future cut in benefits to justify cutting benefits even sooner are asking workers for a give-away where there is no evidence they need to sacrifice themselves in the face of something that doesn&#8217;t appear to be a crisis at all.</p>
<p>Just as supporters claimed when Bush took a run at Social Security in 2004-2005. Five years later and we are right back at 1.92% of payroll.</p>

                                <p>by <strong>Linda Beale</strong><br />Excerpt from <strong>Ataxingmatter</strong> </p>
<p>The post in its entirety can be found at Linda&#8217;s Ataxingmatter <a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/08/health-care-reform-the-virginia-opposition-given-standing-in-federal-district-court.html">Health Care Reform: the Virginia opposition given standing in federal district court</a>:</p>
<p>The judge states that the &#8220;central issue&#8221; in the case is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/08/02/Va%20ruling.pdf">Virginia&#8217;s interest</a> in upholding it&#8217;s &#8220;health care freedom act&#8221;&#8211;a declaration that Viriginia citizens do not have to buy insurance (in spite of the federal mandate).  As Jack Balkin so ably comments (see link below), the judge&#8217;s acceptance of this argument opens the way for states to challenge anything in the Internal Revenue Code by passing a declaratory resolution indicating that they don&#8217;t think it should be treated as constitutional or that conflicts with the particular provision in question.</p>
<p>As for the commerce clause power, the court also treats Wickard v. Fillburn (the Supreme Court case that held that growing wheat for one&#8217;s own use is subject to the commerce clause power) as not decisive on this issue.  Virginia claims that the decision not to purchase is not an economic act, compared to the decision to purchase or the decision to grow one&#8217;s own as a substitute for purchase.  That distinction does not appear to have any merit.  The decision not to purchase insurance and the decision not to purchase wheat are surely similar decisions to try to avoid the commercial flow by managing on one&#8217;s own.  Yet surely one&#8217;s interaction with the health care system is much more clearly a question of interstate commerce even than one&#8217;s ability to grow wheat at home and avoid the purchase of wheat&#8211;even people who pretend to provide their own health care at home will at one time or another impinge on the health care system in all likelihood, whether because they are in a transportation accident, an accident outside their home, a work injury or illness, or taking advantage of free medical care such as vaccinations, etc.    The judge however, concludes that the precedent is inconclusive and that the government has failed to show that the state has not stated a valid commerce clause claim.</p>
<p>Finally, the judge follows Virginia in conflating the Commerce Clause and Taxation Power arguments.  It accepts the idea that if &#8220;economic inactivity&#8221; (which is a misnomer, since it is clearly economic activity to provide one&#8217;s own care, just as imputed income from providing one&#8217;s own home is real economic activity) is not accessible under the commerce clause, then it shouldn&#8217;t be reachable under the tax power.  This is an extraordinarily poorly reasoned section of the opinion.</p>
<p>For a thoughtful and articulate analysis of the standing issues, see Jack Balkin&#8217;s blog, <a target="_blank" href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2010/08/judge-preserves-constitutional.html">Judge Preserves Constitutional Challenge to Individual Mandate</a> (Aug. 2, 2010) [hat tip Ellen Aprill and the Tax Prof discussion group].</p>
<p>Allowing this case to go forward leaves health reform in turmoil.  It could take years for the different cases to wend their way through the courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court will likely have to rule. </p>
<p><strong><em>Linda Beale</em></strong><br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p><strong>Beverly Mann</strong>, whose expertise is in certain areas of constitutional law and federal-court jurisdiction at the <a target="_blank" href="http://annarborist.blogspot.com/"><strong>Annarborist</strong></a>, and who guests at Angry Bear, notes on the same topic (lifted from an e-mail to me):</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah.  I read Lyle Denniston’s article about that opinion on Scotusblog a couple hours ago, and this sentence really strikes me: “‘While this case raises a host of complex constitutional issues,’ the judge wrote, ‘all seem to distill to the single question of whether or not Congress has the power to regulate — and tax — a citizen’s decision not to participate in interstate commerce’ — that is, a private decision not to buy health insurance.”</p>
<p>Actually, the argument that that part of the legislation is within Congress’s purview under the Commerce Clause is that a citizen’s decision not to participate in interstate commerce—that is, a private decision not to buy health insurance—actually is not a decision not to participate in interstate commerce but instead (for many people at least) a decision to participate in interstate commerce by having others pay their emergency medical bills.  If they are, say, injured in a car accident and treated at a hospital and then cannot pay their medical bills, the public pays those bills.  </p>
<p>The problem with the judge’s argument is that people do not decide whether to have a serious medical emergency.  When they do have one, and they receive major medical treatment, there is a bill for that. </p></blockquote>

<p>Hot off the press. PDF of the 2010 Social Security Report: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/tr10.pdf</p>
<p>News Release: http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/trustee10-pr-alt.pdf HTML version: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/trustee10-pr.htm">Social Security Board of Trustees: Long-Range Financing Outlook Remains Unchanged</a> Boy that title blew me away, as did the initial numbers:<br />
<blockquote>The Social Security Board of Trustees today released its annual report on the financial health of the Social Security Trust Funds and the long-range outlook remains unchanged.  The combined assets of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Trust Funds will be exhausted in 2037, the same as projected last year.  The Trustees also project that program costs will exceed tax revenues in 2010 and 2011, be less than tax revenues in 2012 through 2014, and then permanently exceed tax revenues beginning 2015, one year earlier than estimated in last year’s report.  The worsening of the short-range outlook for the Social Security Trust Funds is due in large part to the recent economic downturn. </p>
<p>In the 2010 Annual Report to Congress, the Trustees announced:</p>
<p>The projected point at which the combined Trust Funds will be exhausted comes in 2037 – the same as the estimate in last year’s report. At that time, there will be sufficient tax revenue coming in to pay about 78 percent of benefits.<br />The projected point at which tax revenues will fall below program costs comes in 2010.  Tax revenues will again exceed program costs in 2012 through 2014 before permanently falling below program costs in 2015 &#8212; one year sooner than the estimate in last year’s report.<br />The projected actuarial deficit over the 75-year long-range period is 1.92 percent of taxable payroll &#8212; 0.08 percentage point smaller than in last year’s report.<br />Over the 75-year period, the Trust Funds would require additional revenue equivalent to $5.4 trillion in present value dollars to pay all scheduled benefits.<br />“The impact of the current economic downturn continues to be felt by the Social Security Trust Funds,” said Michael J. Astrue, Commissioner of Social Security.  “The fact that the costs for the program will likely exceed tax revenue this year is not a cause for panic but it does send a strong message that it’s time for us to make the tough choices that we know we need to make.  I applaud President Obama for his creation of the Deficit Commission so we can start the national discussion needed to ensure that Social Security remains a foundation of economic security for our children and grandchildren.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>TomDispatch regular Ann Jones approaches Afghanistan and the American war effort from quite a different perspective. She’s proven a rarity in the way she’s reported back to us in these years. She arrived in Kabul in 2002, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, to work with Afghan women on their problems. Unlike almost any other American who wrote about the experience, she embedded herself in an Afghan world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ann Jones points to many of the problems with COIN and the last nine years in her narrative in this article&#8230;worth a read and some thinking.</p>

<p>HEALTH CARE thoughts: <strong>Integration Speeds Forward</strong></p>
<p> Among those who ponder the operational aspects of health care reform, there is strong sentiment for more use of Integrated Delivery Systems (IDS) in delivering health care.</p>
<p>This is hardly a new concept, but it may well be the concept of the future. </p>
<p>My focus is largely on physician integration although there are other aspects, but the docs are the really big issue, as they drive admissions and order testing.</p>
<p> The first big IDS wave occurred in the early to mid-90s, as physicians and hospitals tried various medical service organization (MSO) models; essentially the hospital owned the physician practices. Many of these deals were disasters, some worked, some evolved into something that worked.</p>
<p>The idea is that if a central entity (an insurer, a hospital, or a hospital network) owns and coordinates services there will better care coordination and cost savings. </p>
<p>The successful integrations so far have largely focused on family practice, internal medicine and ob-gyn (the OBs assistance with malpractice premiums and 24/7 coverage issues).</p>
<p>An interesting change is surfacing, the acceptance of specialists and surgeons into IDS models. Historically there has been a great deal of friction between these docs and the hospitals.</p>
<p>Why the change? Fear of dire economic consequences of staying in a traditional group practice model. Preliminary numbers from the 6/30/2010 residency class is that for the first time, a majority may opt for IDS employment rather than group practice. There are also reports that young docs are more concerned with life balance issues than previous generations.</p>
<p> So, any problems?</p>
<p>Hospitals are notoriously bad at managing physician practices, physician contracts must be structured carefully, physician productivity sometimes drops off with a steady paycheck, and the process of merging practices and/or converting ownership is a great deal of complex work at no small cost. Also, making this work in rural areas is tough.</p>
<p>Biggest question, will IDS on a large scale really cut costs? Or just reshuffle the deck chairs?</p>

<p>First and foremost the long-awaited Social Security Annual Report will be released at noon Eastern on Thursday Aug. 5th. If the release holds true to form it will also go live to the web at that same time. I will have a breakout of the Report at my blog <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2010/08/2010-social-security-report.html">2010 Social Security Report</a>  or you can get your own copy of the Summary (typically 15 pages) or the Full Report (250 pages) at the SSA Trustees Report page: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html I will be posting extracted Figures and Tables here at Angry Bear over the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Second a Social Security news site was brought to my attention by its siteowner. It is devoted to the nuts and bolts of Social Security administration with a focus on Disability. Nancy Ortiz, frequent commenter and Social Security veteran tells me she checks it daily. <a target="_blank" href="http://socsecnews.blogspot.com/">Social Security News</a></p>
<p>Third Aug 14th marks the 75th anniversary of Social Security and is celebrated in the new release of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/index.html">Social Security Bulletin: 75th Anniversary Edition</a>. Of particular note is an article by the Social Security Chief Actuary Stephen Goss <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/v70n3p111.html">The Future Financial Status of the Social Security Program</a> whose abstract is as follows:<br />
<blockquote>This article describes four concepts—solvency, sustainability, shortfalls, and solutions—as they apply to the financial status of the Social Security program as well as how Social Security financing fits in the general federal budget. The little-understood basis for future projected shortfalls is explained and detailed in relation to the possible solutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>A very valuable resource.</p>
<p>Fourth. August is also the normal publication month for CBO&#8217;s Long Term Projection for Social Security. If it is released on schedule it will go head to head with the SSA Annual Report which for the first time allows us a real apples to apples comparison of the respective projections and methodologies without the normal April to August time lag. If so it should be good fun.</p>

<p><strong>“One in 31 Adults”</strong></p>
<p>are under the control of the correctional system (prison, parole, probation) according to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/PSPP_1in31_report_FINAL_WEB_3-26-09.pdf">March 2009 Pew Center Report</a> of the same title. 1 in every one hundred adults are imprisoned in jail, state prisons, or federal facilities. 25 years ago those under the control of the correctional system was one in 77 adults. The population under correctional control is ~ 7.3 million (2007).</p>
<p>What does a growing prison and correctional population cost for taxpayers? To support the growing state prison population, costs range from ~$13,000 in Louisiana to ~$45,000 in Rhode Island annually (2005). The average is ~$23,000 annually, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/29/us/29prison.html">“US Imprisons 1 in every 100 Adults”</a> NYT. The cost of imprisonment compares nicely to a state or private college education (another story). As a whole the US imprisons a higher percentage of its population than any other nation in the world from which the cost burden of housing prisoners has become an issue for states with a decreasing/stagnant economy and decreasing tax revenues. Paradoxically while costing more, jails and prisons for many communities are a stable and growing business employing people, services, and a fast growing part of the rural economies.</p>
<p>Incarceration Nation as one part of, Schmidt, Warner, and Gupta’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue53/SchmittWarnerGupta53.pdf">“The High Budgetary Cost of Incarceration”</a> (Real-World Economics Review, Issue no. 53) suggest much of the increased numbers of those under control of the correctional system result from harsher sentencing guidelines which in turn also have a lesser impact on crime. The mandated guidelines (drugs, three strikes, recidivism issues, etc.) result in higher imprisonment rates and consequently long sentences, higher costs to house prisoners as more prisoners are kept interned for longer periods, and have a diminished impact on crime.</p>
<p>By historical standards the rate of imprisonment in the US is 350+ percent of what it was in 1980. Globally, the US is 3 times higher than the nest in line for imprisonment, seven times higher than the median rate for an OCED country, and seventeen times higher than Iceland which has the lowest rate of incarceration. And yet, the increases in imprisonment can not be explained with certainty by increases in crime. While crime did increase from 1990 to 1992, there was a fall off of crime in later years. In 1992, violent crime peaked at 44% higher than its 1980 level and property crime at 7% above its 1980 level. During the same time period, incarceration grew to 150% of its 1980 level. After 1992, crime decreased to a level close to its 1980 level.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>It is possible to make both an economic and crime impact argument for less harsh sentencing guidelines. Table 3 illustrates 1 in 4 drug offenders are more likely to be imprisoned rather than placed on probation or released earlier on parole. The increase for drug offenders is up from 1 in 10 in 1980.</p>

<blockquote>“The most sophisticated analyses generally agree that increased incarceration rates have some effect on reducing crime, but the scope of that impact is limited: a 10 percent increase in incarceration is associated with a 2 to 4 percent drop in crime. Moreover, analysts are nearly unanimous in their conclusion that continued growth in incarceration will prevent considerably fewer, if any, crimes than past increases did and will cost taxpayers substantially more to achieve.” Stemen (2007). See also Austin et al. (2007), Irwin, Schiraldi, and Ziedenberg (1999), and Public Safety Performance Project (2007).</p></blockquote>
<p> “The High Budgetary Cost of Incarceration”</p>
<p>While the study suggests there is a correlation between harsher sentencing guidelines and the lessening of crime by imprisoning people at earlier ages and harsher sentencing both of which acts as a deterrent to crime, the impact is small and costly in dollars and in societal costs. The increased harsher sentencing guidelines diminishes with the severity of the sentencing and is determined to be as little as a reduction of 2% in crime with an increase of 10% in incarceration. Played out in the harsher sentencing guidelines are costs of ~$75 billion in 2008 up from under $20 billion in 1980 with 60% being borne by state and local governments.</p>
<p>Table 4 suggests a modification of sentencing guidelines of ~50% in sentencing guidelines at the federal, state, and local level would result in reductions in cost of ~$17B with the greatest impact being felt at both a state and local level, the governments restricted by budgeting mandates. The changing of minimum sentencing, truth in sentencing, and three strikes guidelines for non-violent crimes would contribute significantly to increases in prison population.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TFj9dsfQTJI/AAAAAAAAAWI/CwVRtWqURQk/s1600/crime2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TFj9dsfQTJI/AAAAAAAAAWI/CwVRtWqURQk/s320/crime2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This only touches upon sentencing guidelines. Reviewing the actions of state parole boards, one would find many of them are denying parole and holding prisoners well beyond the minimums declared by the sentencing guidelines which are followed by state judges. Add to this an interpretation of a “life sentence” to mean a life in prison in the parole board system the same as a sentence of “natural life.” In effective, the Parole Board is acting as a secondary and more restrictive court in action as appointed officials. Parole boards have little, if any, legal basis to interpret the law differently then the sentencing as interpreted by judges of state law. States could achieve a significant cost reduction in prison costs by holding state parole boards to the sentencing guidelines passed by the state and representative of the population who elected the legislature who passed the guidelines. This restriction on parole boards would add to the cost reduction achievable through a lessening of sentencing guidelines.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>The Ryan Budget Roadmap was introduced in January, and then sank like a stone. But with Ryan&#8217;s appointment to the Catfood Commission it and its author have drawn some new attention which borders on fawning. Or at least part of the plan has drawn attention, that part which would privatize Social Security and voucherize Medicare. What is getting less attention is his radical tax plan which if fully implemented would mean inheritors of great wealth would never pay federal taxes. EVER.</p>
<p>To set the background we have this article from the WaPo Monday <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/01/AR2010080103518.html">Rep. Ryan pushes budget reform, and his party winces</a> And it turn frames it as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Instead, Ryan is running a campaign of a different sort, one his party has so far refused to adopt: He is determined to persuade colleagues to get serious about eliminating the national debt, even if it means openly broaching overhauls of Medicare and Social Security.</p>
<p>He speaks in apocalyptic terms, saying the debt is &#8220;completely unsustainable&#8221; and warning that &#8220;it will crash our economy.&#8221; He urges fellow politicians, and voters, to stop pretending that this problem will go away on its own.</p>
<p>He administers his sermons with evangelical zeal. He will go anywhere and talk to anyone who will listen. When he is not writing op-eds and appearing on television, he can often be found speaking to liberal and conservative audiences alike about his &#8220;Roadmap for America&#8217;s Future,&#8221; a plan he says would fix the problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what is step one and two in cutting &#8220;completely unsustainable&#8221; debt? Well slashing Social Security and Medicare. And step three? ELIMINATE ALL TAXATION FOR BILLIONAIRES AND THEIR HEIRS. Details directly from Ryan&#8217;s website under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The main page for the Roadmap is here: http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/ If we go to the tax reform page we get the following (bolding mine):<br />
<blockquote>This plan discards a needlessly complex and manipulative tax code, replacing it with a simplified mechanism that promotes work, saving, and investment.</p>
<p>Provides individual income tax payers a choice of how to pay their taxes – through existing law, or through a highly simplified code that fits on a postcard with just two rates and virtually no special tax deductions, credits, or exclusions (except the health care tax credit).<br />Simplifies tax rates to 10 percent on income up to $100,000 for joint filers, and $50,000 for single filers; and 25 percent on taxable income above these amounts. Also includes a generous standard deduction and personal exemption (totaling $39,000 for a family of four).<br />Eliminates the alternative minimum tax [AMT].<br />Promotes saving by eliminating taxes on interest, capital gains, and dividends; also eliminates the death tax.<br />Replaces the corporate income tax – currently the second highest in the industrialized world – with a border-adjustable business consumption tax of 8.5 percent. This new rate is roughly half that of the rest of the industrialized world.</p></blockquote>
<p> First thing to note is that this plan for &#8216;simplification&#8217; sets up two parallel tax systems, allowing people to stay on the existing one if they like. Considering that just about everyone would get a  tax cut under the new system why even have this provision in? Because Ryan can only make his revenue projections by assuming that most people will willingly stay on the old system and pay more taxes. But that headshaker pales in comparison to the implications of the text I bolded.</p>
<p>These provisions are billed as encouraging &#8216;savings&#8217;, but on inspection &#8216;savings&#8217; here goes far beyond a worker&#8217;s 401k, it includes ALL investment by anyone including billionaires like Peter G Peterson and Warren Buffett. Because while you can get to be a millionaire by being paid direct compensation by your employer and even a multi-millionaire you don&#8217;t become a billionaire that way, instead billionaires get their money from a combination of dividends, asset sales (capital gains), regular interest, and in some cases &#8216;carried interest&#8217;. Under the Ryan Roadmap all of that would be 100% tax free as would passing it on to your heirs. In turn that would mean that all inheritors and their heirs in turn could if they choose live their whole lives without paying a penny in federal taxes, as distributions from their trust funds would all come in the form of dividends, asset sales, and interest. And of course they would get full enjoyment of all real and personal property accumulated: mansions, art collections, yachts, jewelry, after a couple of generations even the Queen of England might get jealous of all your swag.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a deficit reduction plan, this is a Randian wet dream that would reward the &#8216;Producers&#8217; (here defined as the Trustafarian class living off of grandpa&#8217;s wealth) at the total expense of the &#8216;Parasites&#8217; (that is though people actually contributing to future productivity via labor). This is what passes for &#8216;serious&#8217;, for &#8216;intellectual&#8217;, for &#8216;courageous&#8217; in the Republican Party today. BOLD ENOUGH TO GIVE 100% TAX BREAKS TO BILLIONAIRES.</p>
<p>Note that there is no hint of this in the WaPo article. Now I might have just let this WaPo article pass as being, after all old news, except this Ryan worship seems to be coming a trend. Because CNN followed up with this puff piece this morning <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/us/politics/03ryan.html?hpw">A Young Republican With a Sweeping Agenda</a><br />
<blockquote>In this highly charged election season with both houses of Congress at stake, not a lot of politicians are lining up publicly behind Mr. Ryan. He is, nonetheless, suddenly a rising star in some corners. And like many other politicians whose ideas were once considered extreme, only to later be mainstream — like Ronald Reagan — Mr. Ryan is seen as on the leading edge of something.</p>
<p>Why? His “Roadmap for America’s Future,” an elaborate (critics say drastic) plan that aims to erase the federal debt by 2063, simplify the tax code and significantly alter (his critics say eviscerate) Medicare and Social Security. When asked to handicap the 2012 Republican presidential field, Sarah Palin called Mr. Ryan “sharp.” Newt Gingrich dubbed him “extraordinarily formidable.” And, in a column, George Will imagined him as vice president to a President Mitch Daniels (now the Republican governor of Indiana).</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan, 40 and the ranking Republican on the House budget committee, has been in Congress 12 years, but it may have been President Obama who gave him and his Roadmap the broadest attention yet. This year, Mr. Obama alluded to the plan as a “serious proposal,” though the White House promptly made it clear that it had problems with its details.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just kill me now. This plan that proposes to cut almost all taxation on capital, and all taxation on individual holders of capital,  is billed as &#8216;simplification&#8217;, as something that in time might be seen as &#8216;mainstream&#8217;, that even Obama is willing to dub a &#8216;serious proposal&#8217; although he might have some &#8216;problems with its details&#8217;. Ya think? Anyone want to calculate the cost of THIS proposal over the Infinite Future Horizon?</p>
<p>No one who had read through this plan and thought through the implications could take it seriously.<br />Many people in the major media and in the Beltway take it seriously.</p>
<p>Well it doesn&#8217;t take a lot of logical chops to complete this syllogism and draw the right conclusion. These people are fundamentally not serious, in large part because they know that the American people as a whole are not likely to hold them accountable for not doing their homework. Or maybe one of our crack commenters can explain how you describe a plan to slash trillions in tax on capital still can be scored as solving the long-term budget crisis. You can start with the CBO score of the Roadmap. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10851/01-27-Ryan-Roadmap-Letter.pdf">CBO: Letter to Congressman Ryan</a>. Why didn&#8217;t CBO notice and score the huge hold the Roadmap would blow in future revenue. Simple, they were instructed to ignore it (bolding mine) .<br />
<blockquote>Other Tax Provisions. The proposal would make significant changes to the tax system. However, as specified by your staff, for this analysis total federal tax revenues are assumed to equal those under CBO’s alternative fiscal scenario (which is one interpretation of what it would mean to continue current fiscal policy) until they reach 19 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2030, and to remain at that share of GDP thereafter.</p></blockquote>
<p> Although in truth it is not all just supply-side fairy dust, because the plan does raise some significant revenue. By putting new taxes on labor.<br />
<blockquote>The Roadmap would also eliminate the income and payroll tax exclusions for employment-based health insurance. As a result, more earnings would become taxable for Social Security purposes, thus boosting future benefit payments, and payroll tax revenues credited to the Social Security trust funds would increase.</p></blockquote>
<p> Yep, even if you don&#8217;t earn enough to actually be exposed to income tax, you get to pay a payroll sur-tax from the first dollar on the value of your employer supplied health insurance (if any). The implications of this would require a post of their own.</p>
<p>Ryan Roadmap: Cut taxes on the rich, increase taxes on the poor. Now that is tax simplification we can all believe in! (Not).</p>
