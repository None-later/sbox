                                <p>It has been asserted that many mortgage servicing contracts are inefficient, because they give the servicer incentives to foreclose even when re-negotiation would be better for the owner of the mortgage.  An inefficiency is a profit opportunity.  If there are such contracts, then a different contract can generate higher revenue for both the servicer and the final owner.</p>
<p> If this is a problem, then it is especially tricky in the case of mortgages owned by special purpose entities which issued various debt like tranches and an equity tranche (owned by the sponsor).   In such cases, for all I know, any renegotiation of the service contract might be forbidden, but  I think it is more likely that the sponsor as equity holder could renegotiate the contract with the mortgage servicer.   The problem is that, for many CDOs the equity stake is worthless and would remain worthless even if the mortgage servicing contract were improved.  </p>
<p>Owners of more senior tranches might benefit from a new contract which is equally valuable to the mortgage servicer, but they don’t control the special purpose entity.  The debt like tranches are really more like preferred stock, since failure to make scheduled payments does not constitute default.  Owners of those securities can’t ask a bankruptcy court to seize the special purpose entity to protect their interests.  So, as things stand, there might be an inefficiency such that no one can profit by eliminating it.</p>
<p>The solution would be for the sponsor to purchase some of the preferred stock like securities, then renegotiate the mortgage servicing contract.  Alternatively, an investor could buy the equity tranche (which is worth almost exactly zero) and some of the preferred stock like securities and then renegotiate.</p>
<p>I think there is a possible profit opportunity.</p>

                                <p>This post is long, vague, sloppy and after the jump.  The one sentence version is that the Fed can affect the real economy by buying assets which private investors consider risky.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Before discussing useful things which I think the Fed can do to stimulate the economy, I will explain at length why I think that some proposed interventions would not be effective.  I won&#8217;t argue this (here or in comments) but I think that last years massive purchases of treasury securities (aka QE2) had very little effect on anything.</p>
<p>One possible future policy would be much more of the same, that is much larger purchases of long term treasuries with Fed liabilities.  The academic discussion of possible QE2 started with a proposal of $ 5 trillion new Fed liabilities issued.  The actual QE2 as announced was one tenth that much.  I don&#8217;t think that much huger operations would have a very large affect on anything that matters.  I think this for two reasons.  </p>
<p>First the return on long term bonds with negligible default risk is the compounded expected return on short term bonds plus a risk premium.  Here the risk is not default risk but the risk of mark to market losses over a short horizon due to higher than expected future short term rates. A change in the amount that private investors must hold reduces the risk premium.  The private sector as a whole can go short Treasuries (only the Treasury can do that) so the risk premium can&#8217;t be driven below zero.  It appears to be very low right now, since the overall interest rate yield on Treasuries is low and presumably short term rates will return to normal some time in the next 10 years.  </p>
<p>Second the interest rate that matters for private sector fixed capital investment is the cost of capital to firms, not the cost to the Treasury.  Here I think an important problem might be the cost of capital to firms with poor bond ratings, but the risk premium they pay is mostly due to default risk and not at all the same as the risk in long term Treasuries (I&#8217;d guess it is negatively correlated &#8212; good GDP growth means higher interest rates on short term Treasuries and low risk of default by firms &#8212; long term Treasuries are insurance against poor growth &#8212; less of them in private hands should, in my view, increase the cost of capital to firms at risk of bankruptcy).</p>
<p>Third, while firms care about interest rates over years, I suspect that managers have enough of a short term bias that the rate that matters is over 5 years or less (in a pinch 7 years or less).  The expected flow of funds seven to thirty years from now is just not likely to influence their decisions.  These interest rates are already very low and can&#8217;t be negative.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the Fed can drive down short term nominal rates expected for many years from now with QE3 or announcements about plans for the future or in any way at all.  They depend on future monetary policy by future Fed Open Market Committees facing future conditions.  </p>
<p>The interest rate that matters for firms deciding on investment should be the real interest rate.  I also don&#8217;t think that the Fed can drive up inflation expected for many years from now for the same reason.  A higher declared inflation target should only affect inflation expected for the near future if the Fed will have some way of affecting inflation in the near future.  It shouldn&#8217;t affect inflation expected for when the economy is back to normal &#8212; a promise to create inflation in the distant future by driving unemployment below the NAIRU is not credible.</p>
<p>So I don&#8217;t think that much more of the same will affect GDP much.</p>
<p>How about helicopter drops of money ?  If the Fed gave away money rather than loaning it or buying financial instruments, then it would create the illusion of wealth.  However, the Fed can&#8217;t do this.  The helicopter drop story is a teaching example.  Giving money away is fiscal policy.  This isn&#8217;t just a semantic point &#8212; Congress can&#8217;t give any other body the authority to give away US Federal money &#8212; this is clearly written in the constitution.  Furthermore the argument that the Fed should give away money is based on the argument that Congress should but won&#8217;t.  Doing something that only Congress may do, because Congress won&#8217;t do it, is plainly unconstitutional.  Also I&#8217;d guess someone (Ron Paul or a Paulican) would sue.  The Republican party is against this, so I guess that the Supreme court would block it.</p>
<p>I think it is already clear what I think the Fed can do which would be useful.  First I think the economy would be stimulated if someone bought a whole lot of junk bonds driving up their price and driving down the cost of capital to firms with poor bond ratings.  The creation of Maiden Lane, Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III ltds makes it clear that the Fed thinks it can&#8217;t do this directly.  So I propose loaning more money to one of them (or setting up Maiden Lane IV) and having that entity buy a lot of junk bonds.  </p>
<p>These are the assets whose price is most likely to affect investment.  They are assets which are considered risky so their return can be much reduced if private investors are required to hold less of them.  </p>
<p>Other risky assets are, of course, mortgage based securities.  The Fed can and has purchoased rmbs issued by government agencies.  Here I tend to guess that the Fed can renegotiate servicing contracts to make foreclosure costly to loan servicers.  I even think the Fed can renegotiate mortgages with debtors (OK I hope it would be allowed to do this if it tried).  In any case, it can definitely agree with firms servicing its mortgages that they are not punished for forgiving debt which will never be paid or rewarded for foreclosing on houses which they then can&#8217;t sell.<br />As beneficial owner, the Fed is the principal.  It must be able to prevent its agents from acting against its interests.</p>
<p>So I think that the Fed can act as owner of mortgage backed securities to renegotiate absurd incentive contracts and can (indirectly) buy junk bonds.</p>
<p>So why isn&#8217;t anyone talking about these possibilities ?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Crossposted at <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/"><em>The Street Light</em></a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a bit of discussion floating around about whether the US&#8217;s deficit and debt situation makes it appropriate to draw <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marshall-auerback/we-arent-greece-but-we-co_b_841367.html">comparisons with Greece</a>.  Of course, such a comparison is ridiculous for a number of reasons, not least because the US has its own currency.  But Greece has been on my mind lately for unrelated reasons, including the following news:<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12864413"><strong>Euro economists expect Greek default, BBC survey finds</strong> </a> <br />Greece is likely to default on its sovereign debt, according to the majority of respondents to a BBC World Service survey of European economists.  Two-thirds of the 52 respondents forecast a default, but most said the euro would survive in its current form.</p>
<p>&#8230;The forecasters the BBC surveyed are experts on the euro area &#8211; they are surveyed every three months by the European Central Bank (ECB) &#8211; and as well placed as anyone to peer into a rather murky crystal ball and say how they think the crisis might play out. The survey had a total of 38 replies and two messages came across very strongly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only do I agree that default by Greece on its sovereign debt is quite possible&#8230; but I think it increasingly likely that policy-makers in Greece may decide that it is the least bad option at this point, particularly in the face of an increasingly hard-line attitude from Germany regarding bailouts (which will only be reinforced by <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703739204576228963288429974.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">recent election results</a>).</p>
<p>The problem is easy to lay out: Greece has more debt than it can realistically make payments on, and being a euro country also has a currency over which it has no control.  If it had its own currency, it would be in a classic debt crisis similar to several Latin American countries in the 1980s, or possibly Mexico in 1994.  </p>
<p>However, it effectively has a fixed exchange rate with the rest of the euro zone, and has invested enormous political and economic capital in maintaining its committment to the euro.  In that sense, the best analogy might be with Argentina in 2001, which was struggling to maintain a rock-solid fixed exchange rate with the US dollar through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_Currency_Board">currency board</a> arrangement.</p>
<p>Argentina in the late 1990s had a slowing economy, uncompetitive industries, large current account deficits, and a vast amount of external debt denominated in a currency that was not its own. Sound familiar? In an effort to meet its debt payments while simultaneously keeping its exchange rate pegged to the dollar, the Argentine government squeezed and squeezed the economy.  Finally, however, the resulting deflation and recession grew so severe that the government collapsed, and in early 2002 a new government dropped the peg to the dollar (after fiddling with a hybrid system with multiple currencies existing simultaneously) and eventually defaulted on its debt.</p>
<p>And look what happened.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dyispuKIl8c/TZETJ2gZXTI/AAAAAAAAAdk/6s6qUHng8tM/s1600/argentina%2Bcrisis1.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dyispuKIl8c/TZETJ2gZXTI/AAAAAAAAAdk/6s6qUHng8tM/s400/argentina%2Bcrisis1.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FWJP6z91xEY/TZETPXINMgI/AAAAAAAAAds/vJQ08U6CdBc/s1600/argentina%2Bcrisis2.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FWJP6z91xEY/TZETPXINMgI/AAAAAAAAAds/vJQ08U6CdBc/s400/argentina%2Bcrisis2.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />From 1999-2002 Argentina suffered through years of a gradually contracting economy as it tried to maintain its peg with the dollar and service its external debts. When it finally dropped the peg in January of 2002 and then defaulted on its external debts, the economy (along with the value of the peso) crashed quite spectacularly.</p>
<p>But after a year or two, things didn&#8217;t look so bad in Argentina.  And through most of the 2000s, the economy did quite well, despite the loss of the ability to borrow internationally.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not necessarily advocating that Greece follow the same path.  However, I do think that the comparison with Argentina in 2001 is a very good one, and because of that, that there is indeed a very good chance that policy-makers in Greece in 2011 will reach the same conclusion that policy-makers in Argentina did in 2002.</p>

<p>That we do not teach about this in our schools is why we are who we are.  This list should be a banner which is run along the bottom of every news cast for as long as we are involved in such activity or when a new such action is proposed.  It should be a page in every Sunday newspaper edition for as long as we are involved or when a new such action is proposed.</p>
<p>Most of all, this list and the banner should start with the following words: &#8220;<strong>You have done all of the following&#8230;&#8221;  </strong>I say &#8220;you&#8221; because such actions need to remain personal.   It is always personal.  Yes, you and me personally have done all of this.  Don&#8217;t start thinking that the use of robotics removes you from the equation.  Don&#8217;t fall for that psych-ops.  You, me, we still are the one&#8217;s pulling the trigger.  We did this.  All of this.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />We&#8217;re broke? We have to sacrifice? What do we have to sacrifice, our dignity? Our integraty? Do you like someone doing all this in your name? Your name is on it. Don&#8217;t make that mistake thinking it&#8217;s not. </p>
<p>Oh, it&#8217;s only about the money at this blog? Well, you&#8217;re the private sector, you, me and we. Is this how you would choose to spend your Nth dollar? Is this how you would choose to spend your vaction money, your retirement money, your holiday gift money? I mean, it&#8217;s all extra spending anyway. Gee, you have no extra? Well then, is this how you would choose to spend your grocery money, your heating money (just filled my tank, $3.59/gal), your insurance money, your TAX money? </p>
<p>Is the private sector spending it better than the government sector? How can you tell? See, private or government, it&#8217;s still US. You pulled the trigger. I pulled the trigger by inclusion. We pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>And the rest of the world knows it.</p>

                                <p>David Zetland at Aguanomics suggests that the problems worldwide with water for drinking and as importantly sanitation receives little attention.  I like the poll on his site which suggests for the US that floods or droughts are the main driving force getting us to notice, or special interests.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/business/20supply.html?" target="_blank">Stress Test for the Global Supply Chain</a> &#8211; &#8220;Day in and day out, the global flow of goods routinely adapts to all kinds of glitches and setbacks. A supply breakdown in one factory in one country, for example, is quickly replaced by added shipments from suppliers elsewhere in the network. Sometimes, the problems span whole regions and require emergency action for days or weeks. When a volcano erupted in Iceland last spring, spewing ash across northern Europe and grounding air travel, supply-chain wizards were put to a test, juggling production and shipments worldwide to keep supplies flowing.  But the disaster in Japan, experts say, presents a first-of-its-kind challenge, even if much remains uncertain.  Japan is the world’s third-largest economy, and a vital supplier of parts and equipment for major industries like computers, electronics and automobiles. The worst of the damage was northeast of Tokyo, near the quake’s epicenter, though Japan’s manufacturing heartland is farther south. But greater problems will emerge if rolling electrical blackouts and transportation disruptions across the country continue for long.&#8221;</p>

The country accounts for about 14% of world exports of automotive products.  Japan exported some $469.64 billion of machinery and transportation equipment in 2010. Japan also is a key supplier of advanced components to Asian nations that specialize in the final assembly phase of manufacturing. China depends on Japan for 13% of its imports, largely capital goods such as machine tools and electronic parts for manufacturing. Filed under miscellaneous goods are such products as precision instruments, particularly scientific, optical instruments.&#8221;</p>

When the March data come out in mid-April it will likely mark the second month in a row of declining U.S. industrial output and could mark the start of a worrying trend. Industrial output slipped 0.1% in February. Why will this decline likely happen? It’s because the after-effects of the March earthquake in Japan are disrupting automobile manufacturing in North America in a hefty way. This matters because, despite popular belief, automobile manufacturing still is a meaningful part of the industrial sector. Here’s how it’s playing out: Japan still is a major supplier of parts to U.S.-based car factories. It isn’t just Japanese car brands, like Toyota and Honda, which both announced they would temporarily halt production at some plants in the U.S. General Motors has been impacted by the problem, notably furloughing workers in New York state and Louisiana. It doesn’t take a supply disruption of many car parts to mean that a auto maker has to halt output for an entire plant, at least temporarily.&#8221;</p>

A shortage of Japanese-built electronic parts will force GM to close a plant in Zaragoza, Spain, on Monday and cancel shifts at a factory in Eisenach, Germany, on Monday and Tuesday, the company said Friday. Both factories build the Corsa small car. Meanwhile, the company&#8217;s South Korean unit said it is considering cutting production to deal with a potential shortage.&#8221;</p>

Toyota&#8217;s automaking operations in Japan have been halted since March 14 as it reviews the condition of suppliers providing the 20,000 or more components that make up vehicles.  Auto engineers scouring the northeastern region have found many facilities that were damaged and others that were destroyed, and most automakers haven&#8217;t completed their assessments.  Toyota&#8217;s U.S. manufacturing subsidiary in Erlanger, Ky., told its U.S. employees, plant workers and dealers Wednesday that some production interruptions in North America were likely. The automaker said it could not predict which sites would be affected or for how long. Most of the components used in Toyota&#8217;s North American assembly operations come from some 500 suppliers in the region.&#8221;</p>

So just as U.S. auto sales gather steam, the unexpected war in <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Places,+Geography/Countries/Libya" target="_blank">Libya</a>, surging gas prices and now production cuts triggered by the earthquake have thrown uncertainty into automakers&#8217; rosy 2011 outlook.

<p><a href="http://carfanatics.org/thread-4359.html" target="_blank">Toyota and Ford to stop making cars in certain colors</a> &#8211; &#8220;Automakers may run low on certain paint colors because of a shortage of a pigment produced in an area close to the damaged Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant in northeastern Japan. Ford Motor Co. has alerted dealers to stop ordering vehicles in tuxedo black and three shades of red. Toyota Motor Corp. and Chrysler Group LLC also are among automakers that will be affected by the pigment shortage. The German pigment manufacturer Merck Group confirmed that the Japanese plant that makes a pigment called Xirallic had halted production because it was in the exclusion zone around the damaged nuclear power complex&#8230;once engineers can get inside the plant, the company believes production can be restarted in four to eight weeks.&#8221;</p>

Business analysts don&#8217;t expect large cutbacks, but anticipate that some Indiana plants that employ about 50,000 autoworkers will use short workweeks, scattered short-term layoffs and slower line speeds to keep workers busy during the downturn.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s going to be a major event.

<p><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/7490315.html" target="_blank">Bracing for the pinch on auto parts from Japan</a> &#8211; &#8220;The disaster in Japan already is affecting the U.S. auto industry. Two key questions now are, how much and for how long?  Toyota&#8217;s 13 factories in the United States, Canada and Mexico have been told to expect shortages of parts made in Japan, and U.S. makers that use Japanese parts also are expecting supply disruptions. And that could mean a temporary drop in inventoriesfor some high-demand vehicles in Texas showrooms. &#8220;The biggest unknown in the industry is the parts supply chain,&#8221; said Jesse Toprak, vice president of industry trends at TrueCar.com, a new car pricing site.

About 320,000 vehicles may have been lost worldwide as of March 24, and manufacturing at plants in North America may be affected when parts supplies start running out as soon as early April, said Michael Robinet, vice president of Lexington, Massachusetts-based IHS Automotive.“The next surge of shutdowns comes when the pipeline of parts that were already built dries up,” Robinet said yesterday in a telephone interview. “The rate of lost production will accelerate once North American plants join in.” Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest automaker, said it has lost output of 140,000 vehicles, and Honda Motor Co. has lost 46,600 cars and trucks and 5,000 motorcycles. Mitsubishi Motors Corp.’s was lowered by 15,000. Ford Motor Co. hasn’t lost any output, said Todd Nissen, a spokesman.&#8221;</p>

Toyota Motor Co is likely to idle its own pickup truck plant south of San Antonio.The delivery of parts from transmissions to electronics to semiconductors is being hampered by the Japanese earthquake and subsequent infrastructure problems. About 13 percent of the global auto industry output has been lost now because of parts shortages, Robinet said.The slowdowns could grow even more severe by the third week of April.&#8221;</p>

The company has shut eight plants in Miyagi, Ibaraki and Fukushima prefectures, and workers are inspecting equipment and facilities, he said. Toyota has said it will keep 21 auto and components plants closed until March 22.  Sony and Toyota’s efforts to resume production are complicated by the need for hundreds of different components to build TVs and cars from a variety of different suppliers that may have suffered plant damage in the earthquake and tsunami. <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/japan/" target="_blank">Japan</a> is also facing electricity shortages because a nuclear- power plant was crippled by the temblor.  “This will be played out not in days, but in weeks,” . “Nothing on this scale has really occurred before.”&#8221;</p>

The Finnish mobile phone maker, which sources about 12 per cent of its components in Japan, said the disaster was likely to affect its manufacturing and supply schedules. “Nokia expects some disruption to the ability . . . to supply a number of products due to the currently anticipated industry-wide shortage of relevant components and raw materials sourced from Japan,” the company said. The Japanese disaster has exposed the risks associated with modern global supply chains, in which companies rely on just-in-time deliveries from a network of global suppliers with little surplus inventory to cushion them from any disruption. Technology manufacturers are particularly exposed to Japan because of its importance as a supplier of semiconductors and other critical components in products such as mobile phones and computers. Several big Japanese technology companies, including Panasonic, Hitachi, Nikon, NEC and Sony, have reported disruption either from earthquake damage or power shortages since the disaster. Ericsson, the Swedish network equipment maker, and Sony Ericsson, its mobile phone joint venture with Sony, are among other non-Japan-based companies which have so far warned of supply chain problems.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/japan-disasters-could-hit-consumer-electronics-hard_1209520" target="_blank">Sony | Japan Disasters Could Hit Consumer Electronics Hard… </a>&#8220;Sales of consumer-electronics items, including television sets, DVD players, cameras, personal computers, and video-game players are likely to be impacted by the devastating Japanese earthquake and tsunami, Advertising Age observed today (Thursday). The trade publication observed that while the final assembly of those products takes place in other Asian countries, the components are made in Japan. With Sony, Nintendo, Panasonic, Canon, Nikon and other Japanese-based electronics companies forced to shut down plans, parts shortages are likely to increase prices of many items and produce product scarcity even into the holiday season, AdAge observed. Earlier this week research group iSuppli reported that two Japanese plants that account for 25 percent of the global supply of silicon wafers had been forced to suspend operations. Moreover, two other companies that account for 70 percent of the worldwide supply of the main raw material used to make printed circuit boards have also temporarily shut down.&#8221;</p>
