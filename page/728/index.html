                                <p>In this era of tax cuts, we&#8217;re bound to hear more about &#8220;dynamic scoring&#8221; from those who simply refuse to look at data.   Here is <a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-commerce/2008/1/9/giuliani-tax-plan-is-a-supply-side-dream.html?s_cid=rss:capital-commerce:giuliani-tax-plan-is-a-supply-side-dreamhttp://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-commerce/2008/1/9/giuliani-tax-plan-is-a-supply-side-dream.html?s_cid=rss:capital-commerce:giuliani-tax-plan-is-a-supply-side-dream">James Pethokoukis</a>, who has a blog at US News:</p>
<blockquote><p>One big problem is that budgeteers surely would crunch the numbers and claim the plan would result in $2 trillion to $3 trillion in lost government revenue. Such &#8220;static scoring&#8221; that does not take into account the economic growth impact of lower taxes may well be bunk.</p></blockquote>
<p>So&#8230;  Pethokoukis tells us we have to &#8220;take into account the economic growth impact of lower taxes.&#8221;  Let&#8217;s look at some data to figure out what that economic growth impact might looks like, shall we? </p>
<p>Below is a graph showing the annual growth in real GDP per capita, by president starting with Ike, sorted from fastest growth to slowest growth.  Data comes from the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N#S7">NIPA table 7.1</a>.  For each president, its calculated from the last year before the President took office to the last full year the President served.  (Since JFK was killed and Nixon quit more than half-way through the year, I assumed JFK&#8217;s &#8220;last full year&#8221; was 1963 and Nixon&#8217;s was 1974.)  </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll let you noodle out the color coding scheme I&#8217;ve come up with on your own&#8230; but I will simply note that yes, the blue bars do seem congregate mostly on one side, and the red bars mostly on the other.  Funny thing, that.</p>
<p>Now, another graph&#8230;  This one shows the annual change in taxes as a percent of personal income.  With the same color scheme.  (I hope you&#8217;ve figured it out!!) This includes taxes on labor and capital gains.  The data comes from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175814,00.html">IRS</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4bdaNumL5I/AAAAAAAAA8s/sHO2qVyJLr8/s1600-h/dynamic+scoring+-+taxes+as+a+percent+of+personal+income+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4bdaNumL5I/AAAAAAAAA8s/sHO2qVyJLr8/s320/dynamic+scoring+-+taxes+as+a+percent+of+personal+income+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Once again, the bars on the graph do some pretty obvious self-segregation based on color. </p>
<p>Looking at the two graphs together, I can only conclude&#8230; folks like Pethokoukis and the rest of them that tell us we need to take into account dynamic scoring may be right.  But if we are going to &#8220;take into account the economic growth impact of lower taxes&#8221; we should probably do it right&#8230;  by reducing the expected economic growth.  Though I imagine Pethokoukis and the other dynamic scoring peddlers probably would manage to see something else in the graphs I posted.</p>

                                <p>We are already starting to hear discussion about the point that this is an election year will influence Fed policy &#8211;either to ease or tighten more then it should because of the election.</p>
<p>The historic record is clearly that in election year the Fed does what economic fundamentals call  for it to do and that the fact that it is an election year  has no significant impact on Fed policy.</p>
<p>The chart compares actual fed funds with my version of the Taylor rule that gives inflation and unemployment equal weight.  The vertical grey lines are Presidential elections. It shows that there is no significant difference between  actual fed funds and the policy index in the period leading up to elections  &#8212; if rising inflation calls for higher rates the Fed tightens or if economic weakness or a rising unemployment rate calls for lower rates it eases.</p>
<p>The historic record clearly demonstrates that Fed policy has not been influenced by elections beyond the standard belief that the Fed tried to avoid reversing policy in the last few weeks before presidential elections. Even under Volcker when actual fed funds were substantially above the policy index the direction of changes in actual fed funds was what the policy index implied it should be.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Canadians have just be told to expect $1.50/liter gas within the year. (One liter = .25 gallons.)</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.gasbuddy.com/">GasBuddy</a>, the lowest price in Ontario is now $1.09/liter. In Atlanta, Georgia it is $2.88. Using simple math and disregarding proportional taxation, that will put Atlanta close to $4.30/gallon.</p>
<p>But that is only the beginning of the bad news, according to the <a href="http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/January2008/10/c0114.html">CNW Group</a>, within five years oil is expected to top $150/barrel.</p>
<blockquote><p>The report predicts that surging demand in developing economies combined with accelerated depletion of existing supply and widespread delays in getting new oil fields up and running will see the global supply of oil fall as much as eight million barrels a day below U.S. Department of Energy and International Energy Agency estimates by 2012. </p></blockquote>
<p>The arguments for me are persuasive:</p>
<blockquote><p>Depletion from existing fields has accelerated to over four per cent, a rate that currently cuts nearly four million barrels per day out of each year&#8217;s production.</p>
<p>The second fundamental force blowing up supply forecasts is the huge project delays and massive cost overruns associated with many of the world&#8217;s largest new oil mega-projects.</p></blockquote>
<p>Delays bringing new sources on-line have been the norm. Additionally, technically challenging fields (oil sands, Sakhalim II, Kashagan) are facing increasing costs. &#8220;Cliff-like&#8221; depletion rates have already hit the such as the North Sea, Cantarell, etc.</p>
<p>Then consider the following:
<ol>
<li>Rising demand in developing countries as they become more &#8220;car-centered&#8221;&#8211;Russia, China, etc.</li>
<li>Subsidization of oil prices in oil producing countries, putting a lid on demand destruction in the those countries.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>The article does not mention how gas is priced in China. In order to facilitate its great industrial leap, China has subsidized oil. </i>China wants the car&#8211;and it will not be denied.<br />The summary is instructive:</p>
<blockquote><p>The result of this unchecked soaring demand in most oil-producing nations means they will not be able to add any additional exports to meet the surging demand in developing countries. Since crude demand in countries like China and India is far more income-elastic than price-elastic, these countries are likely to outbid OECD markets for increasingly scarce global supply. The OECD, the largest global oil market today, is much more price sensitive and oil consumption, which has already fallen over the last two years, will decline by almost four million barrels per day over the next five years in response to steadily rising prices. In the U.S. alone, with soaring crude prices pushing the cost of gasoline to US$4.50 a gallon, Mr. Rubin expects American demand for oil to drop by 10 per cent or nearly two million barrels a day by 2012. </p></blockquote>
<p>Americans, of course, are quick to blame the oil companies of price gouging, especially Democrats. Republicans, on the other hand, like to think that oil is infinite. Neither is the case.<br />Ask yourself: What are the economic consequences? How precisely are we going to dodge the recessionary bullet, let alone recover from it? Demand destruction is easy to talk about, but what are the economic consequences?<br />And what do you think the oil producing countries will do as their subsidization grows ever more expensive?<br />The next president is going to face real head winds. Is there a candidate who will tell the truth?</p>

                                <p>The neocons are currently telling us that the surge is working militarily in Iraq, which of course misses the whole point about the political situation there. This kind of short sighted thinking also permeates those who thought we could have won in Vietnam as exemplified by the latest from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YmRjYWI4MDQ4ZTFlNTEyMDNkNmZmMTkzMjk5YjJjNGY=">Thomas Sowell</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first of the shocks of 1968 was the sudden eruption of violent attacks by Communist guerillas in the cities of South Vietnam, known as the “Tet offensive,” after a local holiday. That this sort of widespread urban guerilla warfare was still possible after the rosy claims made by American officials in Washington and Vietnam sent shock waves through the United States. The conclusion that might have been drawn was that politicians and military commanders should not make rosy predictions. The conclusion that was in fact drawn was that the Vietnam War was unwinnable. In reality, the Tet offensive was one in which the Communist guerilla movement was not only defeated in battle but was virtually annihilated as a major military force. From there on, the job of attacking South Vietnam was a job for the North Vietnam army. Politically, however, the Tet offensive was an enormous victory for the Communists &#8211; not in Vietnam, but in the United States. The American media, led by Walter Cronkite, pictured the Tet offensive as a defeat for the United<br />States and a sign that the Vietnam War was unwinnable. That in turn led to the second shock of 1968, President Lyndon Johnson’s announcement that he would not run for re-election. He knew that public support for the war was completely undermined &#8211; and that is what in fact made the war politically unwinnable. Think about it: More than 50,000 Americans gave their lives to win victories on the battlefields of Vietnam that were thrown away back in the United States by the media, by politicians and by rioters in the streets and on campuses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sowell omits various important pieces of information such as the fact that the South Vietnamese government was in turmoil during and after the Tet offensive. Yes, they could defend the cities but they had to cede control of the countryside to the Viet Cong that Sowell mistakenly claims was annihilated. Secondly, when the Johnson Administration asked our generals after Tet whether the war was winnable or not – they could not provide an affirmative answer. But most importantly, Sowell omits the fact the Nixon Administration spent the next four wins trying to win this war and had no success either.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how to read Sowell’s rant. Is he really this stupid? Or is it that the editors of the National Review had to dig down this deep to find such an incredibly dishonest piece of fluff in their desire to bolster the failed Iraq policies of this Administration? And of course, Thomas Sowell once again has no problem complying with a request to basically lie to the readers of the National Review.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to make the argument for a regressive income tax, and not just a regressive income tax, but one that is heavily regressive.  I personally favor a progressive income tax, but I want to do this for two reasons&#8230;.  the first is that it being political season, we&#8217;re seeing regressive taxes being proposed yet again. Sure, they come in the guise of &#8220;flat tax&#8221; or &#8220;fair tax&#8221;, but they&#8217;re regressive. </p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t believe a flat tax on the books is really regressive in practice, ask yourself these two questions:  a)  Who gets a greater percentage of her income from tax free munis &#8211; Paris Hilton or a maid who works at the Hilton?  and b) Who is more likely to retain the services of a high powered tax services company which knows all the loopholes that can be used to shield income or inflate costs, and who is more likely to get a W-2 &#8211; Paris Hilton or a maid who works at the Hilton?  As to a consumption tax like the flat tax, all you need is one question:  who has to spend a greater percentage of his income just to keep body and soul together each and every year of his life &#8211; Steve Forbes or a janitor at the magazine that Forbes inherited?</p>
<p>The second reason I want to make an argument for a regressive tax &#8211; though I think it is not a good idea and is immoral to boot &#8211; is to show how its done.  The conservatives who seem to get play in the media these days seem to specialize in making inane or dishonest arguments.</p>
<p>So here goes &#8211; my best shot at arguments for a regressive tax system:</p>
<p>1.  Economic theory tells us that taxes distort people&#8217;s behavior &#8211; that is, the existence of the tax causes some people to behave differently than they otherwise would &#8211;  which moves the economy away from the free market Invisible Hand equilibrium it would achieve in the absence of the tax.  Thus, the best tax is one that has the least ability to distort people&#8217;s behavior.   It is much easier for Paris Hilton or Steve Forbes to modify their economic behavior and change the way they receive income than it is for someone at the bottom of the totem pole.  In fact, many of the changes that Paris Hilton or Steve Forbes will make will happen without their knowledge.  If a quirk in the law results in one sort of investment vehicle being subject to lower tax rates, people who work for Paris Hilton or Steve Forbes will press the appropriate keys on their keyboards, and if necessary, sign paperwork to ensure that more of Paris Hilton&#8217;s income and more of Steve Forbes&#8217; income comes from that vehicle.  Paris Hilton and Steve Forbes might be informed of the bigger structural changes, but that&#8217;s about it.   On the other hand, what is Hilton maid or the Forbes janitor going to do &#8211; stop going to work if their tax rates went up?  How would they eat?</p>
<p>2.  The income of a janitor at Forbes Magazine is more dependent on Steve Forbes than Steve Forbes&#8217; income is dependent on the janitor.  In fact, the income of  of many janitors and clerks and secretaries at Forbes Magazine is more dependent on Steve Forbes than Steve Forbes&#8217; income is dependent on them.  Forbes can make very, very bad decisions and there go everyone&#8217;s pensions.  He has control, directly or indirectly over the wage of each janitor.  On the other hand, if several or many of the janitors and clerks and secretaries start doing a better or worse job, it probably won&#8217;t affect Steve Forbes all that much.  Even if they manage to tank the company, he has assets in many different places.  Since Steve Forbes is the key link in the chain, the tax system should favor him, not the rest of his employees.</p>
<p>I think those two arguments suffice for the regressive tax&#8230;  now I&#8217;m going to kick it up a notch and argue that the tax should not only be regressive, but heavily regressive &#8211; that is, if the $20K a year is the dividing line between marginal rates of X% and Y% (where Y% <br />3.  Taxes provide disincentives and are often used to purposely change people&#8217;s behavior.  Think of the cigarette tax &#8211; it raises income, but many proponents hope that in the long run, there will be fewer smokers, and there is some evidence that this is, indeed, what is happening.  Now, take a janitor at Forbes Magazine making $20K a year &#8211; tell him that if he puts in a few hours of over-time every week, not only he will make more money, but he&#8217;ll pay less in taxes on that extra income too.  Will he take it?  I think we can all agree the answer is yes.   I have no idea what Steve Forbes makes, but let&#8217;s say you could tell him something similar &#8211; show up to an additional <a href="http://www.investmentcruise.com/cruises/12thforbes07/speakers.asp">continental breakfast at a Forbes Cruise for Investors</a> every year, and not only will you get the extra income from it, but you&#8217;ll pay a lower tax rate on that extra income.  Will he do it?  My guess is that it would take a lot of inducement.  With all due respect to Mr. Forbes, its easier and more pleasant to show up for &#8220;some mingling time with like-minded friends and photo opportunities&#8221; than it is to scrub toilets and battle a cockroach infestation.  And income &#8211; even after-tax income &#8211;  is probably not what makes Forbes make a decision about whether to show up for more mingling time rather than less mingling time now.  Which means that if we want to encourage Mr. Forbes to do more of what he does, more mingling with Pete du Pont and sharing his views about where the economy is going, its going to take a lot of inducement.  That means a big, big break from the government. </p>
<p>Anyway, I can come up with a few more arguments.  Its not difficult.  FWIW, I don&#8217;t agree with any of them.  Maybe I&#8217;ll write up a post pointing out why I don&#8217;t.  But&#8230; these are, to the best of my ability, honest arguments for something that a lot of people really want to see happen.  But they don&#8217;t have the decency to make the honest argument for it.  And you can&#8217;t have a debate with a grifter.</p>

                                <p>Over at RGmonitor, Boat 52 put forth the following <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/235341/">comment</a>.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Slowly but surely the United States is morphing into a larger size twin of Mexico. A small elite ruling class controls politics and enjoys wealth on a scale that is multiples of the average citizen. While the average person is able to enjoy an increase in their quality of life if measured in consumer goods, currency devaluations accomplished no significant increase in prosperity. If it wasn&#8217;t for Mexican law that made 100% foreign ownership difficult, Mexico today would be totally owned by U.S. based entities.   The next presidential election will be the line in the stand to stabilize the U.S. ship of state. That stabilization must tax the wealthy elite, regardless of political affiliation, end the Roman empire like military base expansion globally, and turn our fighting ability to a war on energy with a real solution in the very short term.   The U.S. needs a &#8220;dark horse&#8221; candidate to win and that individual faces the prospect of being a one term candidate if the measures enacted early in the new term do not show meaningful progress.   Failure to elect a agent of change will surely see this decade as the turn in the &#8220;American Empire&#8221; no different than the turn of the British Empire many years ago.   A visit to Mexico spent with the ruling elite (as I have) will open any doubters eyes to the future of the U.S.   In conclusion, I must add that I am a lifelong Republican aged 63 who enjoyed a wonderful career on Wall Street and can do whatever I want. Sadly, I don&#8217;t see the U.S. as a wonderful environment for my grandson age eight unless changes occur very fast. This election as evidenced in a tiny way last night in Iowa (and some may say that basing forecasts on Iowa is laughable) offers a glimmer of hope. Not because of the stature of the candidates but because of the outpouring of voters who are demanding change.</p></blockquote>
<p>The mantra of change is easy&#8230;.but which of the candidates would dare to put forth such an simple agenda?  Who would dare to say we are becoming another Mexico?</p>
<p>Tax the elite?  End military base expansion? Start a real war on energy?</p>
<p>For me, the agenda, the questions being asked of the candidates are shallow and do not address what is really happening to this country.  Are we going to have endless debates about social security?  Endless hedging on universal health care?  Endless dancing around the issue of tax fairness?  Endless paranoia about enemies everywhere? Endless, mindless jingoism.  </p>
<p>I want a candidate who has the courage to tell us what is happening to us, to talk about trade, jobs flying oversees, the endlessly revolving corporate lobbying door, a taxation system that favors the wealthy, who tells us that this country is on a downhill slide.  And then tells us what we can do.  Otherwise, Mexico, here we come.</p>

<blockquote><p>Details of the plan are still emerging, but the campaign says it will include a $3,500-per-person deduction, and deductions for health care, home mortgage payments, charity contributions, and local and state taxes, as well as a $1,000-per-child tax credit. Then a 10 percent tax would be assessed on the first $40,000 earned, 15 percent on $40,000 to $150,000 earned and 30 percent on $150,000 earned and above. It also would include a one-page “fast form” that is supposed to simplify the tax process. The campaign said Giuliani will be joined by Steve Forbes and released a statement saying: “Considering the Democratic candidates for President haven’t been shy about their commitment to raise taxes, the American people can’t afford not to have Mayor Giuliani in the White House. </p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, RUDY has no real plans to cut Federal spending to pay for this massive tax cut – unless he takes the bad advice of <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/01/do-we-have-to-cut-social-security.html">Robert (no relationship to Paul) Samuelson</a> and decides we should slash Social Security benefits.

                                <p>I have had it with the over-analysis of Senator Clinton’s tear filled moment.  John Edwards hurt himself with his questioning of her resolve and now we have this from the <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.com/2008/01/obama_campaign_cochair_questions_hillarys_tears.php">Obama camp</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We saw something very clever in the last week of this campaign coming out of Iowa, going into New Hampshire, we saw a sensitivity factor. Something that Mrs. Clinton has not been able to do with voters that she tried in New Hampshire. Not in response to voters &#8211; not in response to Katrina, not in response to other issues that have devastated the American people, the war in Iraq, we saw tears in response to her appearance. So her appearance brought her to tears, but not hurricane Katrina.</p></blockquote>
<p>Edwards was claiming leaders should show resolve during tough times and now Jackson is saying the Senator was not tearful enough during Katrina?  I have a lot of respect for both men but do these two know both how stupid they sound and how contradictory their attempts at criticism turn out to be.  WTF does this have to do with the issues that we are supposed to be debating during this campaign.  Also – I trust that Mr. Jackson does not wish to be confused with <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/01/08/live-new-hampshire-primary-updates">Bill Kristol</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>10:47 PM: CNN and Fox News have declared Clinton the winner.<br />10:42 PM: Bill Kristol: “It’s the tears. She pretended to cry. The women felt sorry for her. And she won.”<br />10:32 PM: MSNBC and the AP have called the Democratic race for<br />Clinton. CNN and Fox News are not yet making a projection.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Edwards campaign seems to be going nowhere and part of the reason is that he is turning to really dumb sound bite messages rather than hammering away on the real issues.  While the Obama campaign seems to be doing well for whatever reason, his camp would do well to drop these stupid sound bite messages and start focusing on specific problems and his proposed policy solutions.</p>

                                <p>T-bone got me thinking in his response to my comment about Obama. Well, as a good AB&#8217;er, that meant I had to go a hunting. In this case, specifically for Obama&#8217;s econ advisor: Austan Goolsbee.</p>
<p>This lead me to an article by Austan Goolsbee, <a href="http://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/austan.goolsbee/research/ceomfin.pdf">It’s Not About the Money</a>.  Wow, a man thinking like me.  This lead me  to a book:<a href="http://www.bus.umich.edu/OTPR/books.htm"> </a><em><a href="http://www.bus.umich.edu/OTPR/books.htm">Does Atlas Shrug?</a> The Economic Consequences of Taxing the Rich.</em> Edited by Joel B. Slemrod which is a collection of papers presented at an October, 1997 conference in Michigan of which Mr Goolsbee was a participant. <br />(scroll down to mid page.) This lead me to a review of the book which I will post on later. (Yes, I&#8217;m still playing with the income data stuff.)</p>
<p>As a sample of Mr. Goosbee&#8217;s thinking I pulled this from his paper&#8217;s introduction:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>One of the liveliest areas of debate of the last twenty years in public economics has been the argument over the behavioral effects of marginal tax rate changes.</p>
<p>The methodological approach in what I term the New Tax Responsiveness (NTR)literature is to control for the unobserved determinants of taxable income by using “natural experiments,”&#8230;.The influence of the NTR literature such as Lindsey (1987) and Feldstein (1995a) is undeniable and, if correct, has profound implications for tax policy and revenue estimation. The backbone of the NTR approach, however, is this assumption that lower income people are a valid control group for higher income people—that the change in income of the two groups would have been identical if there were no change in taxes. If this assumption is false, existing estimates may have significant biases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And his conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>After ten years of finding large elasticities of taxable income with respect to the net of tax share by using tax changes as natural experiments, the NTR literature has had a large impact on the conventional wisdom regarding progressivity and the efficiency loss of high marginal tax rates. I argue, however, that the results from these papers are based on the faulty assumption that the very rich differ from other income groups only because they have different tax rates. Independent data on several thousand high-income executives as well as on other prominent rich people show that even the moderately rich are not a valid control group.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what&#8217;s the up shot? Well, I&#8217;m still not sold on Obama, but then I&#8217;ve never not had him on the list. I like his econ advisor from the little I read. He likes<a href="http://gsbportal.chicagogsb.edu/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_314_215_0_43/http%3B/gsbjob.chicagogsb.edu/Facultycourse/Portlet/FacultyDetail.aspx?min_year=20074&#038;max_year=20083&#038;person_id=406066&#038;lastName=&#038;firstName=&#038;selFields=&#038;src=FacultyList.aspx&#038;search=False"> comedy</a>! (See Other interests)<br />He is dedicated to his <a href="http://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/austan.goolsbee/website/myworld/november.htm">profession</a>.   He knows how to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austan_Goolsbee">speak</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;a prestigious New England preparatory school, Goolsbee became one of the most decorated competitive speakers in the country. In 1987, Goolsbee won the National Forensics League national title in extemporaneous speaking and finished second in original oratory with a speech on the SAT entitled &#8220;Right of Passage&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Think he may be Obama&#8217;s secret to his oratory ability?</p>
<p>He thinks <a href="http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=125&#038;subsecID=162&#038;contentID=254285">deficits matter</a>.   He thinks companies have a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2131897/">morality problem</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The evidence shows that companies are particularly likely to raise prices when the government is footing the bill&#8230; It&#8217;s not your grandpa&#8217;s moral hazard anymore.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also here he tackles the <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2070062/">529 savings plans</a> problems.</p>
<p>He seems to be hangin&#8217; with a crowd that thinks there is a problem with just focusing on tax rates as policy for moving an economy. Although he also seems to focus a lot on the internet and taxes. This appears to be his “thing”? In doing a quick look at some of his work, Obama&#8217;s current econ plan appears to be totally Mr. Goolsbee&#8217;s ideas. I have no problem with this. It suggests that with Obama, we would actually get people who&#8217;s qualifications actually match the job assigned. Though I feel confident with the top 3 dems we would see properly fitted personnel.</p>

                                <p>Here in the U.S., we sometimes complain about Walmart’s low wages and poor benefits. In China, one trade union rules them all, the ACFTU: All-China Federation of Trade Union, a sanctioned arm of the leaders in Beijing, that takes its marching orders from the Communist Party. We should remember that the party sets minimum wage. The party controls the workers. The party is everywhere, everything.</p>
<p>The ACFTU is intent upon bringing 70 million <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-01/09/content_6379854.htm">additional workers</a> under its fold.</p>
<p>The ACFTU apparently is also concerned about protecting the rights of labor.<br />
<blockquote>For instance, the Wal-Mart unions in Fuzhou, capital of Fujian Province, impressed upon the management to raise part-time workers&#8217; wages to 6 yuan (75 US cents) an hour, that is, above the city&#8217;s minimum wage of 5.5 yuan.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, 75 cents an hour would not go far in the U.S. A Walmart worker in the U.S. making 75 cents/hour would not be rich enough to shop at Walmart, a fact that raises a lot of questions.</p>
