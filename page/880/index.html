                                <p><a href="http://thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10294.htm">Steve Benen</a> has a story today about how all those munitions left unguarded (unlike the Oil Ministry, of course) in the wake of the invasion of Iraq are now being used to target US troops.  Via <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_03/010993.php">Kevin Drum</a>, <a href="http://proctoringcongress.blogspot.com/2007/03/gao-unsecured-munitions-responsible-for.html">Blue Girl Red State</a> has more.  She quotes from a GAO report:</p>
<blockquote><p>The human, strategic, and financial costs of this failure to provide sufficient troops have been high, with IEDs made with looted munitions causing about half of all U.S. combat fatalities and casualties in Iraq and killing hundreds of Iraqis and contributing to increasing instability, challenging U.S. strategic goals in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>Put another way&#8230; because GW and Rummy and company thought it wasn&#8217;t as important to guard munitions dumps as it was to guard the Oil Ministry in Baghdad, US troops and Iraqi civilians are dying today.  And will die tomorrow.</p>
<p>Why anyone trusts GW to continue running this war I have no idea.  (Consider that my one comment on the War appropriation bill.)</p>

                                <p>Jumping off  save the rustbelt’s; “Disaffected 50 Something’s”: an older guy I know in his mid to late 50’s (okay he is a year older than me) recently divorced his second wife.  It was a relatively short marriage entered into a few years after his first marriage, which was a long term marriage with the kids raised and gone, ended in divorce.  Several of his associated, not me I do not believe in remarriage at all (I prefer to keep the GF a GF), advised against it.</p>
<p>Here it is, less than 3 years and paradise has been lost.</p>
<p>One of the motivations for this fellow to enter into matrimony was the “young” lady was not covered at her work by health insurance.  There was a certain economic reason for entering into the marriage rather than living together in bliss.  The problem for my pal is to help her out with medical insurance when the relationship went sour he needs to get a divorce.</p>
<p>What are the economic incentives for marriage?   Why should the state demand a contract such as a marriage license for one person to take care of another?</p>
<p>Are there more divorces than needed due to economic incentives for marriage?</p>

                                <p>Howard Kurtz was just on CNN criticizing the press – just as our press is attempting to return to real journalism.  More on that later as we turn on Norah O’Donnell with hat tip to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/03/23/odonnell-rove">Amanda</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Borrowing the White House’s talking points, MSNBC’s Norah O’Donnell pestered Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) about why he was insisting on “putting on a show trial.” She told him the White House offer was perfectly acceptable. “You’re going to get the truth from Karl Rove. What’s wrong with that?” Later, O’Donnell asserted, “You don’t trust the White House. The bottom line, you don’t trust the White House.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Norah is Howie’s kind of person.  Howie was arguing that we must present both sides of this story as Howie is also upset that real reporters as asking Tony Snow hard questions.  After all – pressing an Administration in full cover-up mode that is also lying through their teeth represents “media excesses”.  Howie would prefer that reporters echo the spin from the White House as it were gospel.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2007/03/you_dont_have_a.html">Belle Waring</a> has been reading some of Jonah Goldberg’s dumber posts (so much material, so little time) and comes across <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGY3ODg1ZGEyYjQ0OTYxYzc0Yzc0ZDNhN2Q1MzhjMDE=">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>My book isn&#8217;t like Dinesh&#8217;s latest book. It isn&#8217;t like any Ann Coulter book. It isn&#8217;t what the Amazon description says or what the Economist claims it is. Or what Frank Rich imagines it is. It is a very serious, thoughtful, argument that has never been made in such detail or with such care.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Belle points out that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-Totalitarian-Temptation-Mussolini/dp/0385511841?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1174558180&#038;sr=8-1">Amazon review</a> claimed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Impeccably researched and persuasively argued, LIBERAL FASCISM will elicit howls of indignation from the liberal establishment &#8211; and rousing cheers from the Right.</p></blockquote>
<p>Goldberg cannot even bother to read the short Amazon review to realize that this review is arguing his book is “impeccably researched and persuasively argued” so he has to add his book is a “very serious, thoughtful, argument”.  It’s sort of like when the Professor would say something and then Gilligan would say exactly the same damn thing.  </p>
<p>This claim that the book is well researched and presents a thoughtful argument as Goldberg has never bothered to do any serious research on any topic on which he babbles on and on.</p>

                                <p>This may be the last post, at least for a while, in the series I’ve been working on for a while.  I think it’s a good summary (using data from 1959 to 2006).  </p>
<p>Table 1 below looks at the average one year % rate of change in the real GDP per capita (4Q), the average one year % rate of change in real m1 per capita (November to November), the average one year % rate of change in real m2 per capita (November to November), and the average real fed funds rate (November).  It does so for years in which there is no Presidential election, for years in which there is a Presidential election with no incumbent, for years in which there is an election in which the incumbent is from a party different than the Fed chair, and for years in which there is an incumbent from the same party as the Fed chair.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RgMmrkYJ1AI/AAAAAAAAAJk/CCV1vCv2t14/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+9,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RgMmrkYJ1AI/AAAAAAAAAJk/CCV1vCv2t14/s320/Fed+Independence+9,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Table 1 shows:<br />1. Economic growth rates are fastest in years in which there is an election and a “friend” (i.e., someone from the same party as the Fed chair) is running for re-election.<br />2. Economic growth rates are slowest when an “enemy” (someone from a different party than the Fed chair) is running for re-election.<br />3. Monetary policy (is most favorable to growth) when a friend is running for re-election.<br />4. Monetary policy (is least favorable to growth) when an enemy is running for re-election.</p>
<p>Now, if the Fed was trying to smooth out the economy, which supposedly is its purpose, presumably when growth was fastest, it would be trying to slow down the economy, and when growth was slowest, it would be trying to speed up the economy.  That is not what we see.  Furthermore, recall that as shown <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and_22.html">in an earlier post</a>, in years when a friend or enemy is running for re-election (columns 3 and 4), monetary policy is correlated with lags in the economy – hence, the economy is following the dictates of the Fed. </p>
<p>OK.  What about when the economy is moving along at a nice clip.  Does the pattern still hold?  Table 2 is the same, but it looks only at years for which the annual percentage growth rate in real GDP per capita is at least 2%.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RgMmj0YJ0_I/AAAAAAAAAJc/uahbrJ9ErSM/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+9,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RgMmj0YJ0_I/AAAAAAAAAJc/uahbrJ9ErSM/s320/Fed+Independence+9,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>In the first two columns, we see the Fed trying to dampen the economy relative to Table 1, which presumably is its job.  But note… Despite the fact average growth rates are higher in columns 1 and 2, column 3 has the most restrictive monetary policy by two out of three measures (real m1 per cap, real m2 per cap, but not fed funds rate).  And how restrictive?  It is enough to point out that the one observation was 1996 – when Clinton was running for re-election, and negative 10.293% is the biggest decrease in real M1 per capita in any year in the sample.  </p>
<p>Notice also… while column 4 still has the fastest growing economy, as the other columns become more comparable, the difference in the monetary policy really stands out.  The fourth column, for instance, is the only one in which real M1 per capita actually increased, real M2 per capita increases by four and a half times what it does in the next fastest column, and the Fed Funds rate is only 60% as high as in the next highest column.  This is no accident or margin of error.  This is very deliberate, very precise.</p>
<p>What about years when the real GDP per capita shrinks?  Table 3 below looks at that.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RgMmXUYJ0-I/AAAAAAAAAJU/mjCLammMoUw/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+9,+Table+3.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RgMmXUYJ0-I/AAAAAAAAAJU/mjCLammMoUw/s320/Fed+Independence+9,+Table+3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>In the first two columns, we now see faster growth (or less shrinkage) of real Money per capita, and we see lower fed funds rates, exactly as should be the case.  Overall, the Fed doesn’t seem to show any more mercy to an enemy in trouble than an enemy that isn’t, and column 4 has disappeared.</p>
<p>From this, we learn:  When there is no Presidential election, or there is a presidential election in which no incumbent is running for office, the Fed seems to behave precisely as we expect.  When the economy is running too quickly, it cuts back on the fuel, and when the economy needs help, the Fed makes money cheap to try to jumpstart things.</p>
<p>Things are very different when the Fed feels it has a dog in the fight.  When an enemy is running for re-election, the Fed uses monetary policy to slow down the economy, regardless of whether the economy is growing quickly or slowly.  This is not just to the detriment of the candidate, but to the detriment of the American public as well.  Because we feel poorer, the likelihood we will vote to re-elect the incumbent decreases.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when a friend is running for re-election, the Fed runs the loosest economic policy possible.  That makes us all feel wealthier, and thus more likely to re-elect the incumbent.  But it increases the likelihood of inflation – otherwise, the Fed would behave that way all the time, not just when its friends could use the help. </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This little cub is pleased to have been invited to join the big bears with some posts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not an economist, but an accountant/consultant/educator/writer with a passionate interest in certain economic topics, as my name would indicate.</p>
<p>So, here goes&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>Being in my mid-50s, many of my friends are also in a 45 – 60 age group, both blue collar and white collar middle managers and professionals. I also have had many mentors who are now older than 65, most of them comfortably retired.</p>
<p>Many of the 50-somethings had not completed their working lives as cleanly as those over 65. Many have been downsized, forced into “voluntary” early retirement, seen their jobs off-shored and had similar major bumps in the economic road. As best I can see, none will ever completely recover, although none are destitute either.</p>
<p>I’ve had a few bumps myself, but due to an unconventional career I have been able to work in several different areas as supply and demand waned and age became an issue.</p>
<p>The economics behind worker displacement have been well discussed here and other blogs (DeLong, Thoma, AB, etc.), but I’ve been wondering about political impacts. Are there any? Will 50-somethings fuel a new populism?</p>
<p>My friends tend to be culturally and fiscally conservative, but are not automatically Republicans. Many are plainly conservative but not openly partisan.</p>
<p>The economic distress here can be traced to NAFTA and Rubin-o-nomics, but the tsunami really did not hit until the recession of 2000-2001, and many have had tough times since.</p>
<p>So I believe much 50-something anger will be directed at the Republican Party, due to a combination of policy and arrogance. Bush’s timing was bad, and the Bush record on displaced workers, income inequality and etc. has not been so good. The arrogance is obvious.</p>
<p>My educated guess is the 50-somethings are regular voters and generally involved citizens, and I can’t help but think some straight ticket GOP voters will change voting habits.</p>
<p>The 2006 elections in Ohio may be an indicator. After a 16 year stranglehold on state government the GOP was trounced. Some of this was due to corruption, but much was due to a saggy economy.</p>
<p>So what do all of you think? Will economic dislocation change voting patterns? Enough to matter? Will there be 50-something populism?</p>

<blockquote><p>According to this study the top 15 doorway domains consist of 14 domains, where the spam percentage is over 74%. This means that in four search results of current study, three sites turned out to be spam. The researchers scanned 1000 most searched queries: &#8216;phentermine&#8217; on blogspot.com and the query &#8216;ringtone&#8217; on hometown.aol.com. The WebmasterWorld experts easily identified more than a half of the search results as spam. </p></blockquote>
<p>In an unrelated topic, I did some google searching of my own and found out that Angry Bear is not unique.  Or rather, this isn&#8217;t the only Angry Bear blog.  Here&#8217;s another blog called <a href="http://angrybear.wordpress.com/">Angry Bear</a>.  I don&#8217;t know who Rhys Prosser is &#8211; to be honest, I&#8217;m not sure if Rhys is a man&#8217;s name or a woman&#8217;s name, but it seems whoever it is just launched Angry Bear.</p>

<p>This from <a href="http://hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc070319.htm">Steve Hussman</a>, manager of the Hussman Fund 3/19/2007.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>“Among all FDIC insured institutions, total assets represented $11.8 trillion at the end of 2006, of which about 40% were real-estate related loans. Though foreclosures currently represent just over 1% of total mortgage debt outstanding, it&#8217;s important to remember that the average return on assets (earnings as a percentage of assets) in the U.S. banking system is also only about 1%. So any continuation in defaults will quickly find its way into earnings figures, either by provisions for loan loss reserves or by actual charge-offs.</p>
<p>Remember also that banks operate on a ratio of about $10 of assets (generally loans outstanding) per $1 of shareholder equity capital. So a 1% loss of existing loans can wipe out about 10% of shareholder capital. Since banks are required to hold such capital against their loan portfolio, wiping out capital also wipes out part of their ability to originate new loans. Importantly, bank capital requirements are a separate constraint from the reserve requirements placed on a bank&#8217;s demand deposits</p>
<p>Note the difference. Reserve requirements apply to the liabilities of a bank (basically customer deposits), while capital requirements apply to the assets of a bank. If banks have insufficient reserves to meet, say, the demand of customers for cash, the Fed can intervene by buying up Treasury securities from banks and paying with reserves (this is what the FOMC really does when we talk about a “Fed rate cut”). Banks can then meet their obligations to depositors without having to call in loans. This is a legitimate “lender of the last resort” function for which the Fed actually does have a critical role (as I&#8217;ve noted elsewhere, except during banking crises, the Fed&#8217;s powers to affect the economy are largely imagined). While some individual banks may be at greater risk than others, we should not be concerned about a general banking failure, precisely because of the Fed&#8217;s ability to act as a lender of last resort.</p>
<p>But capital requirements impose a different constraint altogether. A Fed easing might loosen a binding constraint on bank reserves, but it does not increase shareholder equity capital. Loan losses still go straight to the bottom line, and if the losses are sufficient to reduce shareholder capital, they also limit the amount of new loans that banks can make. It&#8217;s that risk of earnings weakness and “de-leveraging” of the U.S. financial system (not the risk of a general banking collapse), that is a growing concern here.</p>
<p>That is not to say that the Fed is anywhere close to “coming to the rescue” here. The latest inflation figures were fairly hostile to any hope for a near-term rate cut. Meanwhile, overall U.S. capacity utilization has pushed up to 82% &#8211; a level at which the Fed has historically been much more inclined to raise rates than lower them. To call this a “Goldilocks” environment where inflation and economic risks are balanced is like the proverbial image of the guy with his head in the freezer and his feet in the oven, saying the temperature is just right. Inflation and economic risks are balanced because both are unfavorable.”</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This one is by reader CoRev. It highlights a big problem. Rape is a horrific crime. Falsely accusing someone of rape is also. My suspicion is that there are a lot of women out there who have been raped by a criminal that went unpunished, and a lot of men who have been falsely accused. I also believe that false accusations of rape make it much harder to prosecute real rapists, which means more rapists moving freely through society and more women becoming rape victims. Being a data kind of guy, as I read CoRev&#8217;s post, I tried to think of how to test the magnitude of the problem. Sadly, I have no idea.</p>
<p>Note also.  This post is on a sensitive subject.  I assume reader CoRev wrote it in the most delicate way he could.  However, I&#8217;ve found from my own writing, when tackling controversial topics its easy to write something that can be misinterpreted.  Please keep that in mind as you read this.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>False Rape Claims are Real and Disastrous for the Accused</p>
<p>A secret that feminists do not want out is that Women Lie About Rape. The past year has had a spate of highly publicized rape claims which have proved to be in kind terms, erroneous, or in less kind terms, false. Three come to mind immediately, 1) Duke lacrosse (LAX), 2) US Naval Academy Midshipman Lamar Owens (LO) and the US Air force Academy&#8217;s (USAFA) multiple rape claims. The military cases have completed the criminal justice system and the accused have been acquitted, while Duke Lax has been removed from the prosecutors hands. Why are these cases being brought and lost? Because they were not true from the beginning.</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s study courses universally teach just the opposite. Common teachings include: Women don&#8217;t lie about rape. Why would they, it is so painful. Even when they do it is no more than the average of other crimes, two percent. </p>
<p>Two percent? Where did this come from? A <a href="http://llr.lls.edu/volumes/v33-issue3/greer.pdf">study of feminist research</a> documents done by Edward Greer has shown that the claim is a pyramid interlocking and circular references originating from Susan Brownmiller&#8217;s &#8220;Against Our Wills&#8221;. And, the research that Ms. Brownmiller cites? A seminal comment, not researched, by Lt Julia Tucker, former commander of the New York city Sex Crimes Analysis Unit, provided for a New York Judge giving a speech before the New York Association of the Bar, Jan. 16, 1974. </p>
<p>What we have is a &#8220;consensus fact&#8221;. All literature leads to the same facts; therefore, it MUST be true.</p>
<p>Contemporary studies, most better documented than leading feminists, show just the opposite. <a href="http://www.falserape.net/false-rape.htm">This link</a> summarizes findings from a variety of reports. But, be assured that these reports do exist. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.falserape.net/falserapeafa.htm">A summation of several studies</a>, including references, shows that as many as half of all rape claims may be false. Most reports show that the actual number is actually at least ten times the &#8220;Women&#8217;s Literature&#8221; claims.</p>
<p>Once a woman cries, &#8220;Rape,&#8221; the man she points to is seen as guilty&#8211; and the courts make it easy to condemn. Indeed in the Military Services there are victims Support Offices. Cry rape and automatically the accuser is a victim, has a formal infrastructure to support her, and, is usually given transactional amnesty for anything that may come out in her testimony. </p>
<p>The accused has NO SUPPORT. He must pay for his legal fight, and whether he wins or loses his life is scarred. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.falserape.net/false-rape.htm">Reasons some women do it include</a>:</p>
<p>1· to create an alibi,<br />2· to get revenge,<br />3· to get attention or sympathy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next time you hear the story line: &#8220;Stop, or I&#8217;ll claim rape!&#8221; Think about the message being sent to American man and women. Does it reinforce the erroneous teaching in the women&#8217;s study programs. More over, is it a result of the teachings? False rape claims are much higher than what is taught and much more damaging than thought.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Back to cactus&#8230; When I was in college, I had a job giving tennis lessons. One of my students was a girl about thirteen. Her home shared a tennis court with several other homes. Oftentimes, after the lesson, we&#8217;d walk to her house and I&#8217;d find nobody was there. Having grown up in a dangerous place, I wasn&#8217;t about to simply walk away and let a thirteen year old girl walk into a large empty home by herself. On the other hand, I wasn&#8217;t about to walk into a house with a thirteen year old girl either for reasons similar to those detailed by CoRev above. My solution was to sit on the stoop with the door of the house open while she checked every room in the house. She mocked me for it every time &#8211; and let me tell you, you haven&#8217;t been mocked until you&#8217;ve been mocked by a thirteen year old girl.</p>
