<p>The Italian Economy Is Sliding</p>
<p>Today <a href="http://www.istat.it/en/archive/64561">I.Stat released </a>the breakdown of Q1 2012 real GDP for the Italian economy. Weak external demand plus a precipitous drop in private sector spending dragged the headline real gross domestic product (GDP) 0.8% over the quarter (3.2% at an annualized rate). The highlights are the following:
<ul>
<li>Gross fixed capital formation (investment net of inventory formation) fell 3.6% over the quarter, or 13.7% at an annualized rate. This was the fastest quarterly rate of decline since Q1 2009 when GFCF fell 5% over the quarter. </li>
<li>Private consumption dropped 1.0% over the quarter, or 3.9% at an annualized rate </li>
<li>Imports fell 3.6%, or 13.6% at an annualized rate </li>
<li>Exports fell 0.6%, or 2.2% at an annualized rate </li>
<li>The only positive contribution to domestic spending was government consumption, which increased 0.4% over the quarter, or 1.4% at an annualized rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Italy’s real GDP is only 1.1% higher than its lowest point during the recession (Q2 2009). Furthermore, gross fixed capital formation has dropped at an increasing rate for four consecutive quarters. Hope for stabilization eludes, as the current business confidence survey continues its decent – IStat manufacturing confidence was 86.2 in May, which was the second lowest level since the outset of the EMU and well below the 100 average since 2000. Broadly speaking, the economy is imploding.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t pin your hopes on exports.</strong> The contribution of exports to real GDP growth has dropped for two consecutive quarters, bucking a trend of positive contribution since the middle of 2009. The only reason that the net export contribution was positive in Q1 was due to the +1% contribution coming from a sharp decline in imports. This cannot be sustained, as the crisis of confidence has begun.<br />(Note: In the chart below, if real import growth is positive, then the contribution is negative; and if the real import growth is negative, then the contribution is positive.)</p>

<p>This is a product of failed policy at the Euro area level, and something needs to be done to break the positive feedback loop.<br /><em><strong><br /></strong></em><br /><em><strong>Rebecca Wilder</strong></em><br /><em><strong><br /></strong></em><br />crossposted with   <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/2012/06/11/the-italian-economy-is-sliding/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=the-italian-economy-is-sliding">The Wilder View&#8230;Economonitors</a></p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago President Obama said that the private sector was doing fine.</p>
<p>Needless to say this was subject to much criticism from some sources.  But is that criticism justified ?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what the data says.  This chart of real business output  compares output in the five long cycles since WW II &#8212; it omits the 1950s and 1970s because of the multiple recessions in those decades. What the chart shows is that compared to the two long cycles before the Great Moderation that  growth is much weaker but compared to the 1990s and 2000s cycles, growth this cycle is essentially identical.<br />In other words there is no difference between private sector growth now and in the 2000s that Larry Kudlow called the Goldilocks economy.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see what happened to private sector profits in these cycles.</p>
<p>Profits this cycle appear to be about the same as in earlier long cycles. </p>

<p>What about business investments?</p>
<p>Investments are much stronger than the were in the early 2000s and  roughly the same as they were in the 1990s.  It should be no surprise  that investment are weaker than in the 1960s or 1980s</p>

<p>Private payrolls look much like investments &#8212; weaker than in the old style recoveries in the 1960s and 1980s but about the same as in the 1990s and stronger than in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>To finish, I would like to point out that  many of the comments about the private sector economy are based on an erroneous calculation of private sector real GDP.  They seem to think that one can estimate private sector GDP by subtracting government consumption from total GDP.  But that is not correct.<br />Remember, we do not directly estimate output.  Rather the GDP data measures consumption and adjust that for changes in trade and inventories to indirectly estimate output.  For example if Boeing builds a 747 or Ford builds a truck it does not show up in  GDP as output.  It shows up in the GDP accounts in one of five ways.</p>
<p>1. If they sell it to an individual it is recorded in personal consumption expenditures.<br />2. If they sell it to a business it shows up as business fixed investment.<br />3. If they export it is recorded in the trade account.<br />4. If they do not sell it , the jet or truck is counted as an increase in inventories.<br />5. If they sell it to the government it is recorded as government consumption.</p>
<p>But if the jet or truck or some other good or service is sold to the government it still counts as private sector output just the same as if they had exported it or sold it to an individual or a business.  In the GDP accounts, government consumption includes two types of transactions. One is government  employment like a policeman or a soldier.  The other is government purchases of goods or services from private business.  So to correctly estimate private sector GDP you need to subtract only government employment but not government purchases from total GDP.  This makes a big difference in the size and growth of the private economy.  Every quarter that government purchases grow faster than private sector output it causes the estimate of private GDP derived by  subtracting government consumption from total GDP  to understate private GDP.  This method of estimating private GDP generates a highly biased estimate.  For example,using the correct methodology shows that over the past decade private sector real GPD expanded almost 20% while the estimate derived from subtracting  all government  consumption from total real  GDP  concludes that private sector real GDP contracted some -16%.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry, you do not have to find data that breaks government consumption into the two categories to correctly estimate private output.  The BEA does it for you and estimates private output.  But you will not find it in the GDP accounts.  Rather, it is in the productivity data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics under the heading called business output.</p>

<p>Which Spending Is Easier To Cut And By What Level Of Government?</p>
<p>Back from his break, our former co-blogger, Dean Baker at Beat the Press, takes down WaPo ed page editor, Fred Hiatt, for his pushing yet again for cutting Social Security because it is supposedly &#8220;easy to do&#8221; in contrast to medical spending, with Hiatt pinning the blame on Dems for not supporting cutting either.  Baker notes that putting med costs in line with those in other countries would alone completely eliminate the federal budget deficit, and that Dems are not the ones opposing cuts to drug companies or &#8220;overpaid medical specialists.&#8221; <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/beat-the-press/why-does-Fred-Hiatt-say-the-democrats-are-opposed-to-giving-less-money-to-drug-companies-and-overpaid-medical-specialists">CEPR</a>   Hiatt barely nods at GOP opposition to tax increases and the possibility of cutting defense spending, even though the US is winding down some of its current active wars.<br />    <br />Dean kindly avoids noting that Hiatt is part of a group of established media mavens in Washington who long ago convinced themselves that somehow not only is Social Security &#8220;in crisis,&#8221; but that somehow it is the easiest program to cut (future) spending on politically, although that will do nearly nothing to limit near-term deficits and that there is nearly zero support among the public of both parties for such an action, and that efforts by various politicians of both parties in recent years to do this have ended up as embarrassing failures.  But this gang does not give up easily, including Hiatt, back at it yet again.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Unfortunately, the alternative appears to be a trick buried in Paul Ryan&#8217;s budget proposal: send certain social safety net programs down to the states, with the leading candidate being Medicaid, which is already partly funded by the states.  As much as any program, this is one that should be solely funded by the feds as that would help even the playing field across states, given that the states that need it the most are the states with the most poor people and thus least able to support their poor people.  But no, Ryan thinks that Medicaid should be sent fully to the states, and some movement in this direction has already happened.<br />      <br />This hypocritical trend of Grover Norquist &#8220;no higher taxes&#8221; politicians sending important programs to lower levels of government so they can claim &#8220;savings&#8221; without tax increases is going on more widely, also reflecting Norquist&#8217;s influence at even state levels.  So, in Virginia where I live, this most recent legislature, newly run fully by the GOP with our GOP governor, has in an effort to balance the state budget without raising taxes or appearing to cut programs, sent an unfunded mandate to the local governments, removing the funding but requiring that they contribute more to teacher pension funds.<br />    <br />This has led to a fairly astounding result, although the mayor or Harrisonburg, where I live, tells me that a lot of these legislators somehow convinced themselves it would not happen.  Nearly every local government in the state, including the vast majority of ones run by Republicans, has raised local taxes, mostly property taxes, but also others as well.  They have been cutting and cutting their budgets for the last several years, something manifesting itself nationally in the steady stream of layoffs at both state and local government levels.  The expectations by citizens for continuing to have basic local public services of some sort simply overrode this idiocy of no new taxes in the face of this unfunded mandate from the state, which in turn at least partly reflects the ongoing rise of Medicaid costs, exacerbated by the feds pushing even more of those down to the states.<br />    <br />As it is, here in Harrisonburg, property taxes are going up, along with a small increase in the rate on restaurant meals.  The alternative to the meals tax rise (much opposed by local restauranteurs) was to raise personal property taxes.  Around the state, different combinations of such increases have been implemented, and it will be interesting to see whether local voters punish their leaders for doing this or will figure it out that they have been pushed to this by the irresponsibility of state politicians.  This problem may well be worse for local Republican leaders than for Dems, given that in general the latter have not hobbled themselves so tightly with all these inane pledges about taxes, although so far, Grover Norquist has not gotten down to the local level guys with making them sign pledges and holding them publicly to them.  There are just too many of them for him to keep track of all of them. <br />Posted by Barkley Rosser at <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2012/06/which-spending-is-easier-to-cut-and-by.html"><abbr>12:40 AM</abbr></a></p>

<p>Punishing Irresponsible Parents and Punishing the Children of Irresponsible Parents</p>
<p>Not long ago, my wife came home a bit shocked.  My wife has a small business:  she buys houses, fixes them up, and puts renters in them.  If I may brag about my wife a moment, I note she buys well, is good at fixing houses up, and charges slightly below market prices.  The result is that she never has vacancies and that results in pretty good returns year in and year out.</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems she had been speaking to one of her tenants.  At some point in the conversation, the tenant mentioned that her sister &#8211; a single mom on various forms of social welfare &#8211; had recently had another child with the specific purpose of getting increased assistance.</p>
<p>My wife&#8217;s politics, like my own, are  best described as just slightly left of center.  (If you&#8217;ve read much of what I&#8217;ve written, you probably realized that we tend to reach our conclusions after taking a look at what the data says.)  The tenant, as I understand it, also appears to be slightly left of center.  But it was evident to the tenant that her sister was making a bad decision on many levels.  From a financial perspective alone, despite the increase in assistance (welfare, food stamps, housing, etc.), over the long haul, raising a child costs more than that.  Which is why, when some blowhard like Rush Limbaugh, says there are people out there having children they cannot afford for financial reasons, it sounds crazy.  But sometimes those blowhards are right.</p>
<p>Which raises a question.  What do we do about it?  There are plenty of single parents with no prospect of having enough income to keep themselves afloat, much less a family, having additional children while on social assistance.  There are plenty of men out there with no marketable skills whatsoever who have fathered multiple children, and then father more while on social assistance.  What is worse, the problem is to some degree self-perpetuating.  A child raised in squalor by parents who make bad, short-sighted decisions is, in many instances, not developing the skills necessary to do better when he/she reaches adulthood, including decisions about whether and when to have and raise children.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>So there is a dilemma&#8230; in general, it makes no sense to incentivize or reward people who have few or no marketable skills or prospects for having children.  On the flip side, without such support, the children they do have will be raised in worse conditions than they already are.</p>
<p>If there is a real world solution to this problem? Is there a way to ensure that children who are in a bad situation through no fault of their own are well cared for and, at the same time, that nobody benefits financially, receiving rewards from the public purse for having more children than the number for which they could possibly provide good care?  And yes, I recognize that there are success stories out there &#8211; a single parent raises several children, one of whom becomes a basketball legend or a well-known entertainer jumps to mind &#8211; but how many of those are there in the scheme of things?</p>
<p>A few closing comments:</p>
<p>1.  I really don&#8217;t know how to write this post.  I&#8217;m more used to looking at statistics involving taxation and economic growth, and this was different and, frankly, uncomfortable to write.  I tried to be as straightforward and inoffensive as possible while writing it, and if I failed, please bear in mind what I was trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>2.  If you want to leave a comment, please do.  But please stick to real world suggestions.  Real world means practical, having any likelihood of having political support and being legal.  Simply declaring one&#8217;s children a bank and getting bail-outs from the Fed and the feds doesn&#8217;t qualify.</p>

<blockquote>&#8230; state income and sales taxes, which were quick to decline during the recession, have also improved relatively quickly in the recovery. According to the Census Bureau, state revenues were beginning to improve by the middle of 2010 and continued to rise last year. Rising revenues have meant that at least 25 states, including Kansas, are projected to finish their current fiscal year (ending in June) with a budget surplus, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p>Now that states do have a choice about their spending priorities, the question in state legislatures around the country has been, “What to do with the surplus?”</p>

                                <p>alternate title QE 2.MMMCCCLLXXIX as I am a bit obsessed.  One of the many bees in my bonnet is the argument over whether the Fed&#8217;s QE 2 policy hinted, suggested, teased and announced August 10 2010 through November 3 2010 had much of an effect.  My impression remains that it had remarkably little effect on anything for a roughly trillion dollar open market shift.  <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.it/2012/06/non-blast-from-past.html">My view </a>is that the problem was the Fed traded money for the most money like asset which wasn&#8217;t trading as a perfect substitute for money (7 year Treasury notes &#8212; the shortest maturity paying an interest yield noticeably above 0).  This would be a way to minimize the effect for a given quantity. </p>
<p>This post is supposed to be about evidence.  The thing which struck me long ago is that the price of 7 year notes went down in the period from the first hingt of QE2 through the first actual purchases.  This suggests to me that 7 year notes were treated as close substitutes for cash with a relative price not exactly their face value (perfect substitutes don&#8217;t have to have equal prices).  The reply was that the differential between nominal treasuries and TIPS (bonds indexed to the CPI) went up showing an increase in expected inflation which is the key.  To be brief, this pattern corresponds to QE2 working as a signal of future monetary policy and not directly by changing the amount of 7 year notes private agents hold in their portfolios.  </p>
<p>The story, as I understand it, is that the key issue is whether the Fed will keep the federal funds rate near zero when unemployment gets down near the non accelerating inflation rate (NAIRU).  People with this view tend to argue that the Fed could have convinced people that it would keep rates miniscule causing increased inflation, but chose not to.  They tend to argue that QE2 was not very effective, because the Fed was careful to not signal any intention of allowing inflation over 2%.  This post does not address that argument, which would be about why QE2 was ineffective. Rather it addresses the straw man who claims QE2 was effective because it shifted expectations of policy in the misty future with non horrible unemployment rates.  </p>
<p>OK finally a figure showing breakevens: ordinary nominal treasury yields minus TIPS yields. I&#8217;m supposed to warn that it isn&#8217;t really investors&#8217; inflation forecast as bond prices depend on other things including liquidity.  I have a problem with FRED (not with all available data but with easily available data).  FRED doesn&#8217;t show yields on specific nominal Treasuries, because there are just too many of them, but does show yields on specific TIPS of which there are quite few.  This means that the maturity of the real and npominal interest rate series will not exactly match.  I do what I can about this sticking to FRED.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VdWVXMqSS_w/T9TJAxcBLiI/AAAAAAAAAKo/yGv1NMLhlLw/s1600/tips2.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VdWVXMqSS_w/T9TJAxcBLiI/AAAAAAAAAKo/yGv1NMLhlLw/s400/tips2.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Sorry for the pointless legend.  The green line shows the data stressed by say Brad DeLong.  It is a 5 year breakeven inflation rate showing the difference between the 5 year constant maturity normal (nominal) Treasury yield and the 5 year constant maturity TIPS yield.  The blue line shows the difference between the yield on TIPS maturing July 15 2013 and the 2 year constant maturity (nominal) yield.  The red line shows the yield on the TIPS maturing July 15 2012 minus the 1 year constant maturity nominal interest rate.  The black line shows the yield on the TIPS maturing July 15 2012 minus the 2 (two) year constant maturity nominal interest rate.  The breakeven compared to regular nominal Treasuries maturing July 15 2012 should be somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Well that was a lot of typing for one figure.  But the pattern is clear.  The increase in the breakeven inflation rate is higher for shorter maturities than for longer maturities.  This is the opposite of the pattern strawman would predict. Strawman argues that QE2 caused increased expected inflation in the fairly distant future and this  affects inflation and expected inflation in the nearer future through a forward looking Phillips curve.  The change in expected inflation should be greater at longer maturities.  My guess is that the increase in expected inflation is a coincidence.  This post is too long already so more (in progress) after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I know you guessed, but my belief is that the coincidence is that the price of petroleum increased around the time QE2 was gradually announced.  Importantly TIPS are indexed to the CPI not the CPI minus food and energy.  Here the black line is, as before, the 2 year constant maturity nominal interest rate minus the yield on the TIPS maturing July 15 2012.  The blue line is the monthly percent increase in the price of a barrel of West Texas intermediate crude oil divided by 10 to fit it on the same graph.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nvsovy44cgM/T9TWh16otvI/AAAAAAAAALU/MHQ0uaz9BIw/s1600/crudetex.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nvsovy44cgM/T9TWh16otvI/AAAAAAAAALU/MHQ0uaz9BIw/s400/crudetex.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Notice that they track although the oil price changes (even when divided by 10) are noisy.  They are monthly averages, because that is the easy way to get percent change from a month ago.  This isn&#8217;t the way things should be, the oil price changes are backward looking and very short term.  There is no economic logic behind dividing by 10 (0.1 is larger than the share of petroleum as an input to production of goods and services in the CPI basket).  Of course there are very few numbers graphed.  This graph may convince no one but me, but it convinces me.</p>
<p>Finally, to discuss an approach which doesn&#8217;t convince me at all, some have tried event studies.  Here the assumption is that markets are efficient so the full effect of an event on asset prices the moment the event becomes known to the public.  In the case of QE2 this is tricky as news dribbled out.  For one thing I distinguish between QE2.1 the declaration that the Fed would use proceeds from maturing mortgage backed securities to buy treasuries and not to retire money.  This amounted to an estimated (guessed) change in the planned supply of high powered money by about $400 billion and was <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100810a.htm">announced August 10</a>.  QE2 is generally used to refer to QE2.2 the purchase of an additional $600 billion in 7 year Treasury Notes with newly issued high powered money.  The first public hint of this program was chairman <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100827a.htm">Bernanke&#8217;s August 27 speech at Jackson Hole Wyoming</a>.  Note that it was just mentioned as a possibility.  Announcements that it was actually happening and that the amount would be $600 billion came later on September 21 2010 and November 3 2010.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2012/el2012-16.html">Michael Bauer at the San Francisco Fed looks at the sum of changes of interest rates on three dates August 10 plus September 21 plus November 3.</a>  Oddly he doesn&#8217;t look at the relatively famous date of August 27 2010.  The sum is &#8211; 14 basis points (-0.14 %) for the 10 year constant maturity treasury rate, -13 basis points for BBB corporate bonds and -14 basis points for 30 year MBS.  These are very small numbers.  The standard deviation of daily changes of the 10 year constant maturity treasury rate was over 6.6 basis points in 2010.  The standard deviation of the sum of three changes is root three times that.  A change of -14 basis points does not reject the null that nothing special happened those days at standard confidence intervals (the t-statistic with 3 degrees of freedom is about -1.2).  Also the 10 year constant maturity rate increased on August 27 2010.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in event studies, but I note that there is almost no evidence of any effect of QE2 in the FRBSF Economic Letter.</p>

<p>Is Globalization Good for America&#8217;s Middle Class? Part 1</p>
<p>In this blog, I have frequently documented economic trends that have been bad for the middle class: <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/03/basics-real-wages-remain-below-their.html">Declining real wages</a>, steadily <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/07/us-health-care-bang-for-buck-declining.html">falling bang for the healthcare buck</a>, <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/04/america-shows-no-increase-in-college.html">stagnant educational attainment</a>, the gigantic <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/tax-havens-cost-middle-class-untold.html">cost of tax havens</a>, etc. With this post, I want to begin exploring one possible reason for the economic insecurity of the middle class, namely globalization. Today, we will look at who wins and who loses from international trade, one of the key elements of globalization.<br />    <br />In <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2010/04/29/everyone-prospers-with-free-tr">some circles</a>, one is likely to see a variant of the claim that &#8220;everybody&#8221; is better off because of freer trade. Even according to the most mainstream economic theory, this is simply false. The workhorse theory for determining the distributional effects of trade (i.e., who wins and who loses) is called the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem, first enunciated in an article by Wolfgang Stolper and Paul Samuelson in 1941.</p>
<p>To understand this theory, you need to know that economists think about national economies in terms of the amount of land, labor, and capital they have <u>compared to all other countries in the world</u>. These &#8220;factors of production&#8221; can be in relatively high supply compared to the rest of the world, in which case they are referred to as &#8220;abundant,&#8221; or in relatively low supply compared to the rest of the world, in which case we call them &#8220;scarce.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The theorem can be stated in quite simple terms, but its consequences are not at all simple: As trade expands, owners of abundant factors of production benefit, and owners of scarce factors of production are harmed. Here, &#8220;benefit&#8221; means their real income increases, while &#8220;harmed&#8221; means their real income decreases.</p>
<p>Remember, trade can expand for two main reasons. First technological innovations can reduce the cost of transportation, making it first possible, then cheaper, to send goods long distances. For example, political scientist <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/4510.html">Ronald Rogowski</a>, in his great book <i>Commerce and Coalitions</i> shows how the introduction of the steamboat made it possible to export North American wheat to Western Europe, displacing wheat from Eastern Europe. Second, policy changes like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the trade agreements embodying the World Trade Organization (WTO) reduce or eliminate costly barriers to trade and lead to its expansion.<br />    <br />The grain example helps show why trade creates winners and losers. The Midwest U.S. and Canadian Prairie provinces are a gigantic breadbasket made possible by low population density, which implies abundant land and scarce labor. Expanding trade gave these farmers new markets and higher incomes. In much more densely populated Europe, the reverse is true: labor is abundant and land is scarce. As a result, expanding trade in grains meant more import competition and lower income for European farmers..    <br />Fast forward to today and we can ask what U.S. factor endowments are currently. As a rich country internationally, the United States is necessarily a capital abundant country. As a comparatively low population density country, it is land abundant but labor scarce. The answer is to our initial question is then quite clear: expanding trade is harmful to U.S. workers because imports of labor-intensive products and services from abroad create competition for American workers, reducing their real wages. As I have discussed before, U.S. real wages have remained below their peak for 39 straight years, just as the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem would predict.<br />     <br />What about <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/05/free-trade-benefits-everyone-canard.html">all the cheap goods we now buy at Wal-Mart</a>? It doesn&#8217;t change this story at all, because the lower price of imported goods is already reflected in the inflation rate we use to calculate real wages.    <br />Rogowski&#8217;s book also argues that we can expect certain pattens of political coalitions to form, with the winners from trade on one side and the losers on the other. NAFTA illustrated this well, with capital and agriculture generally in favor of the agreement (minus a few small specialty agricultural products like oranges), while labor was strongly opposed. And of course, this only helps us understand economic reasons for support or opposition to trade agreements; for non-economic reasons such as the environment, we have to look elsewhere. Although beyond the scope of this post, Rogowski&#8217;s analysis of the entire world through phases of rising and falling trade (i.e., the Great Depression) lends strong credence to his claims. You should definitely read his book sometime.<br />    <br />Economists are divided over how big this effect is. In the 1990s, when I first started teaching, the most common view of economists was that technological change was the driver increasing the premium for high skilled labor while reducing wages for low-skilled labor. Adrian Wood&#8217;s 1994 book, <i>North-South Trade, Employment, and Inequality</i>, argued that trade was in fact the main culprit, (a good, ungated analysis is Richard Freeman&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/pdf/Classic_Media/Freeman_1995_Globalization.pdf">Are Your Wages Set in Beijing</a>?&#8221;). Although this met with a lot of resistance at the time, Wood&#8217;s view has gained a lot of traction among economists based on developments over the last 15 or so years. Paul Krugman, a particularly noteworthy example due to his Nobel prize, has gone from being <a href="http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/ricardo.html">a fanatic adherent of free trade</a> to someone who sees trade as a big problem, though even today <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/protectionism-and-stimulus-wonkish/">he is not quite willing to pull the plug on free trade</a>.<br />    <br />One important point Rogowski makes (and Stolper and Samuelson did before him) is that the theory of comparative advantage tells us that the winners from trade gain more than the losers lose, which makes it possible in principle to compensate the losers and have everyone be better off. But he also argued that those who benefit economically from trade will see their political power increase, something that has certainly been borne out in the United States in the more than 20 years since his book was published. This makes it less likely that such compensation will occur, and we certainly haven&#8217;t seen any policy in the U.S. that comes close to making everyone better off as a result of trade.<br />    <br />One small bit of comfort comes from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Conscience-Liberal-Paul-Krugman/dp/0393060691">Paul Krugman&#8217;s book</a> <i>The Conscience of a Liberal</i> (pp. 262-3). He provides us some reason to think that the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem isn&#8217;t necessarily destiny, as he shows that the United State and Canada, two countries with the same factor endowments as each other, have distinctive differences in political outcomes, particularly with regard to unionization rates.    <br />Overall, unfortunately, it looks like the answer to today&#8217;s question is clear: freer trade has harmed, and is harming, the American middle class. But globalization is more than trade, and I will continue to analyze other elements of globalization in my next few posts. </p>

<p>Let’s Play “You Be The Sucker!”</p>
<p>Let’s see. Business and banks have heaps of money – and aren’t hiring, spending their money, or loaning it out. Meanwhile, a few million working-age Americans have no money and no work, and many are young, strong, highly trained and capable. Business is complaining that they can’t get suitable employees for some sectors. But they aren’t training them, and in sectors where wages are low, they aren’t raising wages. Houses stand empty, while thousands are homeless or living in cramped conditions with family or friends. They are all playing “Don’t Make Me The Sucker.” It’s like a game of musical chairs where no-one gets off their chairs except the terminally benign or naïve. You can crank up the music all you want, but nobody’s moving.</p>
<p>And in this game, they’re all correct. If any of them moves without all the others moving, they get to be The Sucker. For instance, what if the unemployed went first? Suppose they went to the zero lower bound of wages and offer to work for free till the economy improves, “to show willing,” as the Brits say. But the losses they would court – loss of unemployment support, loss of time for real job search – are hardly balanced by the slim possibility that the humble homage they pay to the source of all human worth, the employer, will in the future be rewarded by a decent wage and steady work. Giving something for free hardly ever raises its price. In a rising economy this could work, for some. In a stagnant one, the unpaid employee is the sucker.

<p>    <br />But the employer is in a fix too. There’s no fence that keeps his success from nourishing the business-slackers around him. If he goes first, and pays his people a living wage, his employees will spend their dollars at the cheapest stores – the ones who didn’t waste their time and money on wages and benefits. The generous employer creates customers for others, not for himself. If he goes first, he’s the sucker.    </p>
<p>Even if new employees were his for free, enlarging his business when there are no customers is a recipe for failure. He briefly nourishes other businesses by building a bigger plant, investing in machinery and training, and what comes of it? He gets to be the sucker. Banks trying to make loans in a time of stagnation are obvious suckers. Where’s the profit in loaning at 3.8% when the risks of default are not only high, but controlled by other, unpredictable, even fraudulent actors in the financial arena? If hegoes first, he’s the sucker.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>   <br />Businesses who need specialized employees are suckers if they try to train them or take them through apprenticeship. Where’s the guarantee that the employee won’t take his skills elsewhere – to a business that can offer higher wages because they didn’t waste money in training? If a business trains first, he’s the sucker. Each one alone is a sucker for trying to do what, in a functioning economy, makes sense. In stagnation, only fools try to go first, and not one in a hundred succeed if they try.<br />    <br />So obviously what we need, right here, right now, is a nation of fools. Can anything get all the players off their chairs in back into Mr. Fezziwig’s dance? Nobody trusts anybody, and rightly. The smaller players can’t do it, and the giant ones hardly need to. \But something needs to be done. As our wise Mr. Pratchett said regarding the game foote-the-ball, “…a tactic was for players to cluster thickly around their own goal so there was no possibility of anything getting past them. I regret however that if both teams do this you do not have a game so much as a tableau.”<br />    <br />And a tableau, however individually sensible, is not an economy.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I’m not nearly the first to this party, but want to bring it up for my readers who may not be clued in to it.
<p>For the second year in a row, some of the best economics bloggers on the Web (this year: Matt Yglesias, Mike Konczal, Karl Smith, Lisa Donner), did a session at Netroots Nation on monetary policy, and how the progressive left (including Democratic lawmakers) needs to saddle up and counter the destructive right-wing influence in this area.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.netrootsnation.org/nn_events/nn-12/organizing-federal-reserve/">Why the Fed is the Most Important Economic Issue You Know Nothing About</a></p>
<p><strong>This is a big deal.</strong> Monetary policy often, even usually, has a far more potent effect on national well-being and the distribution of wealth and income than the fiscal policy that progressives consider to be so important. (At least in the short- to medium term.) Those fiscal issues <em>are</em> important. But ignoring monetary policy is like ignoring coal plants in discussions of global warming.</p>
<p>Lefty idol Paul Krugman has given this example a zillion times: when Volcker opened the monetary taps in ’83 (after clamping down to tame inflation), the economy — and the employment situation — turned around hugely, <em>within months</em>. That was something of a special case, but it imparts the potential power and immediacy of monetary policy compared to many/most fiscal initiatives, which usually take quite a while to play out, and are rarely large enough to be big short-term game-changers.</p>
<p>But in the political realm, Democrats have largely <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/congress-to-bernanke-do-less-not-more/2012/06/07/gJQA8jNMLV_blog.html">ceded their voices to the ‘Pubs</a> (HT <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2012_06/poor_understanding_of_monetary037825.php">Ryan Cooper</a>) and their inflation hysteria (which survives like a zombie that won’t die, year after year, even while being wrong, year after year):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“I wish you would take QE3 off the table,” said Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the ranking Republican on the committee.</strong> “I wish you would look the markets in the eye and say that the Fed has done too much.” Similarly, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) complained to Bernanke that many of the stimulative measures the Federal Reserve has taken “are giving us a false sense of security.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By contrast:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The ranking Democrat on the committee, Sen. Bob Casey, merely inquired, in a neutral tone, whether the Federal Reserve was planning to take further action.</strong> Bernanke simply replied that the Fed was still contemplating the matter, and a lot depended on whether “there will be enough growth going forward to make material progress on the unemployment rate.” (Fed officials meet on June 19 to discuss their next steps.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Fed is supposed to:</p>
<p>1. Provide for both stable prices and full employment.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>2. Be politically independent.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>1. It has criminally abdicated its responsibility for employment in recent years, while fetishizing its inflation mandate.</p>
<p>2. It <em>is </em>subject to political pressure, as the quotations above make clear.</p>
<p>More proof of #2, from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/business/economy/02jobs.html?_r=2&#038;hp=&#038;pagewanted=all">Binyamin Applebaum</a> (HT <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/06/02/234098/lack-of-left-flank-to-monetary-policy-debate-has-the-fed-stuck-in-neutral/">Matt Yglesias</a>), quoting Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’ve done things that are quite unusual. We’re using tools that we have less experience with,” Mr. Rosengren said. <strong>“Most of the criticism has been that we’re being too accommodative. That is a concern that we have to put some weight on.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s time for progressives and congressional Democrats to start exerting some of that pressure. Pay attention, people!</p>
