                                <p>This post looks at interest on the national debt by presidency. Its kind of a strange series… the President has some influence over this – if he cuts spending, for instance, all else equal, there will eventually be a decrease in the interest payments on the debt. (It can take a while.) On the other hand, movements in the Fed Funds Rate (controlled by the Federal Reserve) set an effective floor on the interest rate paid on treasury bonds… thus, the Fed probably has more influence over the interest on the debt than the President does. That said, the President can react to these changes by the Fed. A smart President will direct the Treasury to issue more short term debt if interest rates are high and expected to drop, or to issue more long term debt if interest rates are low and expected to drop. On the other hand, with real interest rates at their lowest in almost three decades, GW directed the Treasury to retire the 30 year bond, resurrecting it only after rates began to move up. (No doubt pointing out that GW did the opposite of what just about every home owner in America did (i.e., refinancing and locking in low rates in the past few years) constitutes another manifestation of my Bush Derangement Syndrome.)</p>
<p>Here’s a graph of interest payments on the National Debt as a percentage of the budget, and another with debt as a percent of GDP.</p>

<p>The huge increases under Reagan&#8230; that&#8217;s because of the huge increases in the debt. And I note&#8230; normally, this is where someone insists that whatever positive we observe under Clinton is due to the Republican Revolution, even when the trend for whatever series we&#8217;re looking at begins in 1993. So to help out those folks, who can spot the year that Newt took over on the graph? (A less snide comment &#8211; what happened in 1995?)</p>
<p>Here are summary tables to match…</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rq8iOUPDHqI/AAAAAAAAAgA/U7ad9ovG71g/s1600-h/interest+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rq8iOUPDHqI/AAAAAAAAAgA/U7ad9ovG71g/s320/interest+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>

<p>So what do we learn? Well, GW has been incredibly lucky so far – the combination of the Fed’s keeping interest rates low and Clinton’s paying down the debt has helped to ensure interest payments on the debt have not had consequences as bad as they might otherwise have been. (Of course, his little stunt with the 30 year bond plus the now increasing debt means he won’t be passing along any of that luck to his successor. In fact, the upward trend on interest payments mean we, the American public, will get hosed sooner rather than later. When I write, as I have many times, that in my opinion this administration is qualitatively different than all the other ones that I can remember, this is an example of what I mean.)</p>
<p>BTW… notice the numbers… 8 cents on every dollar spent by the Federal government these days go to pay interest on the debt. And about a cent and three quarters of every dollar produced in this country goes to pay the national debt. These are non-trivial expenses bequeathed in large part by the massive run up in debt courtesy of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-national-debt.html">St. Ronald the Reagan and George Bush the elder</a>. (What, you didn’t think all that debt was gonna come at no cost, did you? Put another way… you didn’t think Reagan’s “tax cuts” were going to be free, did you? Now is when the bill gets paid.) </p>
<p>Data on the debt is for the total net debt, and it comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist03z2.xls">Office of Management of Budget Table 3.2</a>, as does data on total outlays. That table only contains data going back to 1962. <br />Data for GDP comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z2.xls">Office of Management of Budget Table 1.2</a>.</p>
<p>Next post in the series… Farm Subsidies. And if I can get the data, I hope to follow that with Welfare.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The healthy healthcare discussion on Saturday (courtesy of Dan) led me to thinking (yes, that is dangerous) about the Medicare-for-all concept. I’ve spent 30 years coping with the business details of Medicare so I wondered if I could simulate a program.</p>
<p>As a first quick step I pulled some physician office financials and budgets and made the following modifications:</p>
<p>1)      dropped private pay fees to match Medicare, increased Medicaid fees to match Medicare; the change was a reduction in collected revenue of about 35% &#8211;  ( this would be different for a practice that was primarily Medicaid.)</p>
<p>2)      the billing effort would be somewhat simplified (although not as much as some might think) so I dropped 30% of the billing cost, which translated to about 5% of collected revenue</p>
<p>3)      I did not adjust ancillaries or procedures not currently covered by Medicare, but the impact would be small in many practices, practices with imaging centers or etc. would need a more complex model</p>
<p>This is a rough study based on a small sample of practices, and the result is equivalent to a 30% reduction (-35+5) in collected revenue and likely a 15% &#8211; 20% reduction in take home pay and benefits.</p>
<p>For a surgeon earning $500,000 this would result in an income of $400,000.</p>
<p>For a family practice doc, this would knock an income of $120,000 down to $96,000. My model may be flawed however, a better data sample would likely tell us that the family practice doc takes a bigger hit – it depends on practice mix.</p>
<p>For an OB/GYN, this could mean an increase or decrease, depending on the percent of Medicaid patients, and the balance of deliveries to surgeries.</p>
<p>I think this would be tough to sell to physicians (Medicare has a history of political shenanigans with reimbursement rates) unless some way could be found to relieve the docs of billing and/or IT costs as an offset. Also, there would have to be some fairly sophisticated modeling to determine where proper reimbursement levels would be.  The rationing issue lurks.</p>
<p>Medicare and Medicaid assume the government patients will be subsidized by high paying private pay. Changing the system would be an interesting challenge. I have not addressed &#8220;who do we pay for this yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>
<p>PS: I just signed off on my manuscript proof for a book-and-CD on medical office management. I am going to sit on my back porch this evening and have a cold brewski. I request all AB regulars join me in that ritual.</p>

                                <p>I am on record stating, before the Surge began, that I expected it to fail.  I hope it succeeds &#8211; I hope something succeeds, but I don&#8217;t think this administration has the competence to get anything to work in Iraq at this point.</p>
<p>But a lot of people are insisting the Surge is working.  Some of the signs are kind of dubious &#8211; we&#8217;re now arming and paying some of the Sunni fundamentalists that were previously shooting at US troops (and will likely be shooting at US troops again in the near future) because they&#8217;ve turned away from Al Qaeda.  But there seem to be a bunch of folks who were predisposed to think the Surge was going to work telling us it is, the latest beig <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/opinion/30pollack.html?_r=4&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;oref=slogin">O&#8221;Hanlon and Pollack</a>.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on in Iraq?  Are things getting better?  Well, how would we know?  The obvious metric would be &#8211; how many Iraqis are getting killed and/or fleeing their homes.  But the administration won&#8217;t tell us that &#8211; they won&#8217;t even hazard a guess.  Sure, we&#8217;re told that the figures printed in the Lancet were waaaay out of the ballpark, but what we aren&#8217;t told is what figures are in the ballpark.</p>
<p>What about alternative metrics?  There was that report a month or two back, but according to the US ambassador to Iraq, electricity is <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-na-iraqpower27jul27,0,7131927,full.story?coll=la-home-center">&#8220;more important to the average Iraqi than all 18 benchmarks rolled up into one.&#8221;</a>  So electricity proviced to Iraqis it is&#8230; except that that funny things are happening with that metric too. </p>
<p>So how are we supposed to know if things are getting better?  Well, maybe the lack of metrics is itself a metric.  If things were getting better, wouldn&#8217;t the administration want to make it easier, not harder, for us to know?  Wouldn&#8217;t they want to put out a report showing that fewer Iraqis are getting killed, that people are returning to areas that had been ethnically cleansed, that there was more electricity?  </p>
<p>And that pardoxical metric&#8230; the lack of metrics &#8211; is a metric that everyone understands.  Even the people who tell us things are getting better.  Because after all, there is one more metric of how well or how poorly things are going in Iraq that we all understand.  The number of westerners willing to walk the streets of Baghdad (and perhaps anyplace else in Iraq), openly, unarmed and unescorted by the military, dropped to zero per month somewhere in early 2004 and it hasn&#8217;t budged since.  I think the first sign of improvement will be a change in that metric.</p>

<p>Another try at a serious discussion of terrorism.</p>
<p>This post follows up a previous post on terrorism<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/reader-dan-mulling-over-definition-of.html">listing four very general outlooks</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2006/12/losing_the_batt.html">This article</a> on electrical grids in Iraq has wider implications than causing havoc in Baghdad. John Robb has an intelligent opinion that covers part of the terrorist movement in Iraq.</p>
<blockquote><p>The <em>aha</em> moment for Iraq&#8217;s global guerrillas when they discovered how to accomplish an <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2005/06/effects_based_o.html">effects based operation</a> using broad-based systems disruption:</p>
<blockquote><p>Electricity officials say the decisive moment came July 6, when saboteurs mounted coordinated attacks across the country, gaining a lead in the battle that the government has not been able to reverse. “They targeted all the lines at the same time, and they all came down,” Mr. Abbo said. Mr. Abbo said a typical strategy was to set off explosives at the four support points of a single tower, which would then pull down two or three more towers as it toppled. As repair crews moved in hours or days later, another tower farther up the line might be struck, and then another, in a race the government had little chance of winning.</p></blockquote>
<p>NOTE: this is a great example of how ideas are driving the evolution of warfare and will ultimately decide the winners and losers in this long war. It&#8217;s interesting to note that the DoD doesn&#8217;t have a mechanism for purchasing ideas that would help them win. They can spend trillions on contextually useless weapons systems and personnel but can barely free up a couple of thousand dollars on the ideas necessary to win this war (let alone a couple of million on a research firm dedicated to this).</p></blockquote>
<p>And another outlook comes from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/world/middleeast/26insurgency.html?ei=5088&#038;en=1bd1f805c30e2ae2&#038;ex=1322197200&#038;partner=rssnyt&#038;emc=rss&#038;pagewanted=all">this article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While such data may have been omitted to protect the group’s clandestine sources and methods — the document has a bold heading on the front page saying “secret” and a warning that it is not to be shared with foreign governments — several security and intelligence consultants said in telephone interviews that the vagueness of the estimates reflected how little American intelligence agencies knew about the opaque and complex world of Iraq’s militant groups.</p>
<p>“They’re just guessing,” said W. Patrick Lang, a former chief of Middle East intelligence at the Defense Intelligence Agency, who now runs a security and intelligence consultancy. “They really have no idea.” He added, “They’ve been very unsuccessful in penetrating these organizations.” He said he was equally skeptical about the report’s assertion that the insurgent and militant groups may have surpluses to finance terrorism outside Iraq. “That’s another guess,” he said.</p>
<p>“A judgment like that, coming from an N.S.C.-generated document,” he said, is not an analytical assessment as much as it is a political statement to support the administration’s contention that Iraq is a central front in the war on terrorism. “It’s a statement put in there to support a policy judgment,” he said.</p>
<p>Several analysts said that, except for the possibility that Al Qaeda of Mesopotamia might be transferring money to Qaeda factions elsewhere, the assertion that insurgent money might be flowing out of the country was doubtful considering the single-minded regional focus of most of the militants operating here.</p>
<p>Dr. Magnus Ranstorp of the Swedish National Defense College, an author of extensive studies of the Iraqi insurgency, said he doubted Iraqi groups were ready to finance terrorism outside the country. “There’s very little evidence that they’re preparing to export terrorism from Iraq to the West,” he said. “I think it’s much too early for that.”</p>
<p>The document tracing the money flows acknowledges that investigators have had limited success in penetrating or choking off terrorist financing networks. The report says American efforts to follow the financing trails have been hamstrung by several factors. They include a weak Iraqi government and its nascent intelligence agencies; a lack of communication between American agencies, and between the Americans and the Iraqis; and the nature of the insurgent economy itself, primarily sustained by couriers carrying cash rather than more easily traceable means involving banks and the hawala money transfer networks traditional in the Middle East.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we are not nimble enough and are consistently out maneuvered, at least in the public part of the problem, it seems we will be constantly leveraged in effort to contain the threat.</p>
<p>Part III will include AQ in SE Asia, where the sophisticated threat is located.</p>

<blockquote><p>U.S. average retail gasoline prices fell 17 cents per gallon as Midwest refiners recovered from recent difficulties and produced more gas, according to an industry analyst. The national average for self-serve, regular, unleaded gas was nearly $2.8843 a gallon on July 27, down from the July 13 level of $3.0577, according to the nationwide Lundberg survey of about 7,000 gas stations.  Prices fell after refining capacity in Coffeyville, Kansas and Whiting, Indiana came back online.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reuters seems to be arguing that prices have declined as the supply curve shifted out, which we noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/gas-prices-rise-on-refineries-record.html">here</a> as we also argued for a cartel model explanation of the same facts.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Regular readers know my formative years were spent in South America in the dictatorship years. Whether its a positive or a negative, I often think of politics like a South American might have done a few decades ago.</p>
<p>So consider this. Say your country is fighting an existential struggle against a foreign collectivist philosophy, and there are two political parties &#8211; the Patriots and the Collaborators. (The name of these two parties differed by country, but otherwise the similarities were sufficient across Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, etc., from about the 1930s to the mid 1980s that I hope the reader will excuse my taking a shortcut here.) The Patriots are allied with the military, old money, and big business and are willing to fight to keep that foreign collectivist philosophy from gaining any foothold. The Collaborators&#8230; well, I picked the name for a reason &#8211; the Patriots call them collaborators. For whatever reason, folks like students, university professors, union members, peasants seem to throw their lot in with this group in whatever country you&#8217;re talking about. Granted, if you asked them, most of the Collaborators would insist that their opposition to having the military/old money/big business call the shots doesn&#8217;t make them supporters of this foreign collectivist philosophy, but hey, they&#8217;re Collaborators so why would anyone believe them?</p>
<p>The story differs by country, but it was often the case that the Patriots were forced to have a coup in the the 1930s or 1940s, in the 1950s, and also again in the 1960s or 1970s. And it was for the good of the country. </p>
<p>Now, consider the position of a President from the Patriot party. He&#8217;s fighting a war &#8211; perhaps its metaphorical, perhaps not. Either way, the war is not going well. Consequences of losing the war, of course, would be disastrous for the country, and the fight is worth the price. Granted, he hasn&#8217;t instituted the draft, or if he has, it only snags the poor (in a country like Chile or Argentina, you wouldn&#8217;t find the sons of wealthy families in the military &#8211; maybe just maybe you&#8217;d find a few members of the middle class depending on the decade, and in Brazil, I doubt even that was true), and he isn&#8217;t willing to change that, but still, he understands its a desperate fight, worth the lives of soldiers and the enemies. Its also worth borrowing a lot of money to fight that war&#8230; paying for it out of taxes, though, would clearly be a silly idea, as any member of his Party could explain.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s consider decisions this President might have had to make. Put yourself in the position of this President &#8211; you know, absolutely, and without any doubt, that this threat is existential. Which of the following are you justified in doing?</p>
<p>1. Using government resources to promote Patriot candidates.<br />2. Using government resources to suppress votes among perceived supporters of the Collaborators.<br />3. Using government resources to monitor perceived Collaborator voters.<br />4. Using government resources to monitor Collaborator candidates.<br />5. Using government resources to hurt perceived Collaborator supporters.<br />6. Using government resources to hurt Collaborator candidates.<br />7. Arresting perceived supporters of the Collaborator party.<br />8. Arresting candidates of the Collaborator party.<br />9. Killing perceived supporters of the Collaborator party.<br />10.  Killing candidates of the Collaborator party.<br />11.  Openly killing perceived supporters of the Collaborator party.<br />12.  Openly killing canddiates of the Collaborator party.<br />13.  Cancelling elections.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know&#8230; its a tough question, but if you know, if you truly absolutely positively know without any shadow of a doubt that this existential fight to the death is on, you should be willing to take all of these options. And these are things that happened not once but multiple times in every single one of the countries that I mentioned from the 1930s to the 1980s. I note&#8230; in many cases, I think it could be said that the President wasn&#8217;t a true believer &#8211; just some SOB who liked to be in power.  I also don&#8217;t think (and this is just my opinion talking) the taking of these steps was justified in even a single case of which I&#8217;m aware in South America from the 1930s to the 1980s.  Not one.  </p>
<p>(Note&#8230; this isn&#8217;t to say that I don&#8217;t think its possible to come up with real world circumstances where these steps are all justified.  But its not as easy as you think&#8230; consider the classic (Latin American) example of Cuba, for instance&#8230;  keeping Fidel Castro and his thugs from power would probably have been worth that price, but would it be worth the price if keeping Batista and his thugs in power was added to the bargain?  And is it not likely that the fact that Batista was exercising all these options, 1 through 13, long before Castro came to the scene was partly responsible for creating Castro in the first place?  If you didn&#8217;t like the thugs in power, what options did you have?  Who could you support?  And how could you gather enough information, in that environment, to find out that the alternative might be worse?) </p>
<p>Just for grins, pretend a guy we all know, GW, was placed in the position of this President. My guess is that GW, or some of the people he surrounds himself with are quite comfortable with , <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/25/AR2007032501048.html">option 1</a> and <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2167284/pagenum/all/#page_start">option 2</a>. I don&#8217;t think a lot of people would be surprised if it also turns out that some <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/washington/29nsa.html?ei=5090&#038;en=d689a624e9208b40&#038;ex=1343361600&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss&#038;pagewanted=all">perfectly justifiably programs were used for option 3</a>, but most of us would be surprised if he was comfortable using them for option 4. Similarly, it would seem that there is a willingness to play <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/06/05/cia.leak.trial/index.html">option 5</a>. </p>
<p>I could see instances where option 6 would also be on the table for GW&#8217;s people, but I don&#8217;t see options 7 or 8.  And options 9 through 13, I do not believe GW or his people would do it under any circumstances.  The thing I wonder is&#8230; if he truly believes, and I believe he truly believes, why isn&#8217;t he willing to take these steps? I&#8217;m glad he isn&#8217;t, but I still wonder why.  And I wonder about some of his supporters.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Cons:</p>
<p>My wife wanted me to run around the countryside shopping for curtains yesterday, and she bribed me by buying my lunch at Red Lobster (I’m easy).</p>
<p>While enjoying my feast I looked out the back window of this particular site and looked straight at an abandoned Wal-Mart. The place looked almost new, just abandoned.</p>
<p>On our way to the curtain store we passed a brand new “Super” Wal-Mart, about 500 yards from the abandoned store.</p>
<p>Does this make sense to anyone?</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Many lower income people are not especially welcome at banks.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart has a new form of prepaid Visa debit card, enhanced over prepaid Visas available elsewhere by serving a check cashing function (if the cashed check is put on the card, no fee) and allowing direct deposit of a paycheck. I believe the debit card be used to withdraw from an ATM.</p>
<p>For those who are not familiar with these cards, they are name imprinted and can be refilled at tens of thousands of retail stores for a modest fee (certainly more modest than payday loan and check cashing places). The card can be used anywhere a Visa debit card can be used.</p>
<p>We found these cards helpful when our children traveled, had car emergencies, and etc. so they can be useful to lots of people. The new Wal-Mart version has the additional features.</p>
<p>So although Wal-Mart was blocked from banking, this seems to be a useful addition to their services. For someone without a bank relationship this could reduce the need to carry cash and allows the convenience of a debit card.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart still has the standard gift cards and reloadable “student” gift card, good only for shopping at Wal-Mart.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/07/blinder-on-taxing-carried-interest.html">Greg Mankiw</a> comes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/business/yourmoney/29view.html?ei=5090&#038;en=973b345a4a0b4227&#038;ex=1343361600&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">Alan Blinder</a> on the taxation of carried interest:</p>
<blockquote><p>An arcane debate is raging in Congress over the appropriate taxation of the bountiful incomes of people who manage private-equity and hedge funds &#8211; incomes that can range into the hundreds of millions a year. I don’t recommend trying to master the details unless you have either an accounting degree or insomnia. But one thing is easy to understand, though hard to swallow: Some people who are richer than Croesus are paying 15 cents in federal income taxes on the marginal dollar, while you may be paying 25 or 35 cents.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/alan-blinder-lo.html">Mark Thoma</a> found the following interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why do we have a preference for capital gains in the first place? The main argument is that lower taxes on capital gains boost investment. But the evidence on that point is iffy at best, and there are better ways to spur investment, like, say, the investment tax credit. Besides, lower taxes on capital gains reduce the tax bills of the rich relative to the rest of us &#8211; after all, they own most of the capital. But in this age of hyper-inequality, shouldn’t we be making the tax code more progressive, not less? A far more important objection is that the tax preference for capital gains undermines capitalism &#8211; a system in which capitalists, not the state, are supposed to make the investment decisions. When I discuss this issue with my Economics 101 students, I show them an example of a proposed investment that loses money before tax (and which, therefore, should be rejected) but which actually turns a profit after tax because of the preferentially low capital gains rate. (Accountants and tax lawyers live this example every day.) The government thus induces people to make bad investments, which is a good way to run an economy into the ground. Come to think of it, that’s just what the old Soviet Union did. It invested copiously, but badly. BUT would taxing capital gains like other types of income imperil our economy? No. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 did exactly that, and it did not end capitalism as we know it. In fact, the gross domestic product in 1987 and 1988 grew at about the same rate as in 1985 and 1986, and the investment share of G.D.P. barely budged. As the tax debate unfolds, you may find it difficult to follow the mind-numbing complexities. Who doesn’t? So just remember one simple principle: If we tax Activity A at 15 percent and Activity B at 38 percent, a free-market economy will give us more A and less B. Some of this shifting will represent genuine movements of resources out of B and into A &#8211; including those bad investments I just mentioned. The rest will be paper manipulations devised to avoid taxes. Which of these do you think our tax code should favor?</p></blockquote>
<p>The distortion effects from preferential treatment of certain kinds of capital income is a point that I think deserves more attention.  The pseudo-economists from the right (many who write for the National Review) want us to believe that cutting tax rates for capital gains promotes growth.  Alan Blinder presents a very coherent argument that they may have this all wrong.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Who really wants the yuan to rise? Who does not and why? Two parties are not interested in the yuan being seriously revalued. The first is China; the second is the Treasury Department, which now speaks primarily for Western firms in China. The reason? The answer is <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-07/28/content_5445216.htm">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to Vice-Premier Wu told a dinner in Washington in May attended by Paulson and Bernanke that the yuan&#8217;s value was not the cause of the deficit.<br />She added that about 85 per cent of China&#8217;s surplus with the US is from foreign companies exporting products no longer made in the United States, such as shoes. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Eighty-five percent,&#8221; economists. Western firms in China, not indigenous Chinese firms, account for eight-five percent of China&#8217;s trade surplus with the U.S.</p>
<p>Meanwhile&#8211;as reported in the above article and <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/070727/us/politics_usa_china_bill_dc">elsewhere</a>&#8211;the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday voted 20-1 on a bill that would give the U.S. the tools to address the currency misalignment as well as countering dumping. But the Treasury Department really does not want anything to do with this proposed legislation, insisting that &#8220;discussions&#8221; are the way to go. Chuckle.</p>
<p>Quite honestly, this administration likes the peg, and will be led kicking and screaming to do anything serious about it. Foreign companies, especially American ones, are doing quite well in China&#8211;and profiting handsomely from the peg.  Apple&#8217;s profits are skyrocketing. In fact, American companies, mnc&#8217;s cozily ensconced in developing nations, have led the stock market boom of recent years. The only thing that will hurt them is the credit crunch in the U.S. &#8211;the consumer exhaustion&#8211;and the persistent high cost of energy, which is sure to go higher as we get ever closer to peak oil.</p>
<p>I have written frequently on the trade deficit and on how globalization is being mishandled, favoring large corporations and investment firms that can chase cheap labor and low taxation everywhere on the planet. I know the Treasury Department is in the pocket of these firms. I suspect that even those dreamy-eyed liberal economists who thought that globalization as structured might now be having second thoughts. But dreams die hard.</p>

<blockquote><p>Earlier yesterday, it seemed that the candidates were fleeing the unconventional format, in which the public asks questions via video. Mr. Romney told The Union Leader in Manchester, N.H., that it could be demeaning for presidential candidates to “answer questions from a snowman,” a reference to a video question that was presented to the Democratic presidential candidates in their YouTube debate on Monday … Mr. Madden said the Romney campaign’s decision not to participate was “not a question of format, it’s a question of our travel schedule.” Still, Mr. Madden said, “a lot of Americans would wonder whether we should be answering questions from a cartoon.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Madden’s choice of words will cause at least some embarrassment for Mitt the Twit.  Yes, I despise the two-faced campaign being put on by Mr. Romney but not nearly as much as the campaign being put on by Rudy Giuliani.  His latest to call Democrats a party of <a href="http://www.myfoxhouston.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=3888866&#038;version=2&#038;locale=EN-US&#038;layoutCode=TSTY&#038;pageId=3.2.1">losers</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani called Democrats &#8220;the party of losers&#8221; for demanding a scheduled pullout of American troops from Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank goodness for <a href="http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2007/jul/27/happy_hour_roundup">Joe Biden</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tough talk and cheap shots won&#8217;t make America any safer&#8230;. It is absurd for Rudy Giuliani to call Democrats ‘losers&#8217; after five years of failed Republican policies in Iraq&#8230;. Giuliani and the rest of the Republican candidates continue to cling to this Administration&#8217;s failed policy that a strong central government can be propped up in Iraq. If these are the positions he wants to defend, I invite him to debate me on these important topics.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Giuliani will likely decline this invitation for reasons similar to those for ducking the YouTube debate as explained by Katherine Seelye:</p>
<blockquote><p>Matt Lewis, who is director of operations at townahall.com, a conservative Web site, and who was not part of the petition, said Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Romney had the most to lose. I’m sure their advisers are telling them that a lot of bad things could happen in a YouTube debate,” Mr. Lewis said. “When you’re the front-runner, you don’t think so much about how you can win but how you can avoid losing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In a YouTube debate, Rudy might have to field a question from someone who is not about to tolerate his parade of lies.  Or worse yet, Rudy might have to field a question from a NYC fireman.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader brings us the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0BPnnvI47Q">snowman</a> that scares Mitt Romney. While Sammy was trying to defend Mitt the Twit, let’s thank him because this rather funny YouTube question was about Global Warming.  Yes – that important policy issue on which much of the GOP leadership has just flat lied to the American people.  A little humor from a citizen scares Romney – while brazen dishonesty from the leaders of his own party is AOK.  I get it.</p>
