<p>We have graphed the 30-year fixed mortgage rate from 1971 to today as something about the latest from <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_06/011505.php">Kevin Drum</a> didn’t seem quite right:</p>
<blockquote><p>My first thought when I see a 30-year fixed rate of 6.74% is that it&#8217;s an incredible bargain. Until about 2002, I hadn&#8217;t seen a rate that low in my entire adult life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe we had not seen mortgage rates lower than 6.7% in our adult lifetimes, but surely Kevin is old enough to recall when mortgage rates dropped below 6.75% during the latter part of 1998.</p>

                                <p>I just discovered the blog of <a href="http://www.theittlist.com/site/ittlist/ind/4447">Brian Zick</a>, which brings us to something interesting from <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/06152007/watch.html">Bill Moyers</a>.  It’s 5 minutes and 41 seconds worth listening to as it notes the hypocrisy of so many members of this Administration and the political hacks that carry their water.  The transcript can be found <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/06152007/transcript1.html">here</a>.  Moyers notes at the end that there are “contrarian voices”:</p>
<blockquote><p>PATRICK BUCHANAN: This is an open and shut case of perjury and obstruction of justice. And the Republican party, you know, stands for the idea that high officials should not be lying to special investigators. </p>
<p>BILL MOYERS: And from the former Governor of Virginia, James Gilmore, a staunch conservative, comes this verdict: &#8220;If the public believes there&#8217;s one law for a certain group of people in high places and another law for regular people, then you will destroy the law and destroy the system.&#8221; So it may well be, as the Hartford Courant said editorially, that Mr. Libby is &#8220;a nice guy, a loyal and devoted patriot&#8221;&#8230;but none of that excuses perjury or obstruction of justice. If it did, truth wouldn&#8217;t matter much.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I just wish more conservative Republicans would join Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Gilmore in condemning what Mr. Libby did.</p>

<blockquote><p>Al Qaeda is counting on sapping our will, and persuading America to choose to lose a war it could win.</p></blockquote>
<p>Really?  We can win?  Win What?  Kristol thought we could win this thing with very little effort.  But that was before that really stupid decision on March 19, 2003 – you know the one he craved for. But that was just their title.  Their ignorance of history is on full display as they compare the bombing of a couple of mosques to the Tet offensive. </p>
<blockquote><p>Last week, a group of tribal leaders in Salah-ad-Din, the mostly Sunni province due north of Baghdad, agreed to work with the Iraqi government and U.S. forces against al Qaeda. Then al Qaeda destroyed the two remaining minarets of the al-Askariya mosque in Samarra, a city in the province. Coincidence? Perhaps. But al Qaeda is clearly taking a page from the Viet Cong&#8217;s book. The terrorists have been mounting a slow-motion Tet offensive of spectacular attacks on markets, bridges, and mosques, knowing that the media report each such attack as an American defeat. The fact is that al Qaeda is steadily losing its grip in Iraq, and these attacks are alienating its erstwhile Iraqi supporters. But the terrorists are counting on sapping our will as the VC did, and persuading America to choose to lose a war it could win.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Tet offensive involved 100 towns with the fighting continuing for two months.  And we did not end our involvement in the Vietnam War for another five bloody years.  Yet, we never had a chance of subduing the opposition of our presence in Indochina.  </p>
<p>Has Kagan and Kristol figured out that many Iraqis – including those who hate Al Qaeda – see as us an occupying force?  If we leave, Osama bin Laden is not going to reign in Baghdad.  But also long as we stay  &#8211; Al Qaeda has a cause in Iraq.</p>
<p>Al Qaeda wanted American boots on the ground in a Muslim nation.  President Bush was really stupid to listen to these two neocons and their ilk over four years ago as he gave Al Qaeda exactly what they were counting on.  And if we stay as Kagan and Kristol plead that we do – we play into Al Qaeda’s hands.  Kagan and Kristol have got nothing right so far.  So why should they start making sense now?</p>

<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/06/phelps_us_did_n.html">Mark Thoma</a> treats us to an exchange between <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/06/savings_glut_or.html">Martin Wolf</a> and <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/wolfforum/2007/06/villains_and_vi.html#comment-72798466">Edmund Phelps</a> that revives the savings glut argument.  Martin writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The “savings glut” hypothesis is associated with Ben Bernanke, now chairman of the Federal Reserve. But the idea was floated earlier by others. Brian Reading, of Lombard Street Research, lays out the line of argument in a recent note*. A substantial excess of savings over investment has emerged, he says, predominantly in China and Japan and the oil exporters &#8230; This has led to low global real interest rates and huge capital flows towards the world’s most creditworthy and willing borrowers, above all, US households. The short-term effect is an appreciation of real exchange rates and soaring current account deficits in destination countries. To sustain output in line with potential, domestic demand in those countries must also be substantially higher than gross domestic product.</p></blockquote>
<p>About two years ago <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2121017/fr/rss">Daniel Gross</a> criticized any attempt to excuse America’s low national savings rate:</p>
<blockquote><p>The savings glut may be an accurate and subtle take on the world&#8217;s economic imbalances. But less subtly, it minimizes the impact of the potentially destructive monetary and fiscal policies pursued by the U.S. over the last five years. It also lays the responsibility for change squarely on the backs of foreigners and makes a virtue out of what appear to be our own failings. No wonder Bernanke is so popular at the White House.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/06/not_a_savings_g.html">Brad DeLong</a> added to Daniel’s discussion the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Daniel Gross writes about the &#8220;savings glut.&#8221; But world savings are not that high: the swing of the U.S. federal budget from $200 billion annual surplus to $350 billion deficit alone &#8211; that&#8217;s a decline in savings equal to 30% of China&#8217;s entire current exchange rate GDP. It&#8217;s not so much a global savings glut as a worldwide investment shortfall.</p></blockquote>
<p>To suggest that we have a savings glut that would lead to a recession unless we continue fiscal expansion presumes some sort of liquidity trap where lower interest rates will not encourage more investment demand.  That may have been a plausible explanation where short-term interest rates were less than one percent (see our chart).  Over the past three years, however, we have seen a significant increase in short-term interest rates.  In other words, monetary policy has been trying to restrain investment demand.  So explain to me why a rise in national savings combined with an easier monetary policy would be a bad idea?</p>

                                <p>AB read T-bone lets us know that <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/taxes/supply-side_spin.html">Fact Check</a> actually does its job:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain has said that the major tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 have &#8220;increased revenues.&#8221; He also said that tax cuts in general increase revenues. That’s highly misleading. In fact, the last half-dozen years have shown us that we can&#8217;t have both lower taxes and fatter government coffers. The Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers and a former Bush administration economist all say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been – even if they spur some economic growth. And federal revenues actually declined at the beginning of this decade before rebounding. The growth in the past three years that McCain refers to brings revenues back in line with the 40-year historical average as a percentage of gross domestic product.</p></blockquote>
<p>The author – Lori Robertson – does a nice job of documenting how certain Republican politicians are spinning.  Lori also has a decent list of sources as to what economists have been saying.  We could say that John “Straight Talk Express” McCain should be ashamed of such dishonesty, but then this is not the first issue where he is flat out lying to the voters.  Nor is he the only Republican Presidential candidate who is telling these Laffer lies.</p>

One does not want to be unfair to Thompson, who may have hidden depths.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well let’s not go overboard trying to be fair to Fred Thompson.  As a loyal <em>Law and Order</em> viewer, I can testify that Fred Thompson cannot act.  And just tosses out all sorts of meaningless one-liners with no meaning.  But then again – the same can be said about Mitt Romney.</p>

<blockquote><p>Unless congressional Republicans aggressively focus on extending expiring tax cuts, taxpayers will soon enough be facing the biggest tax hike in American history.  Recall the history here: When President Bush’s first tax cuts were enacted in 2001, the president had to agree to a sunset clause providing that, unless extended, the tax cuts would expire at the end of 2010. This unfortunate provision nevertheless helped secure enactment of the tax bill by making the fiscal impact of the tax cuts on the budget seem smaller than it would otherwise have been counted under congressional rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fiscal impact of the past six years has been rather massive in terms of the size of the General Fund deficit.  Which means we never cut taxes – we only deferred them.  But this is not the only thing Mr. Factor gets wrong:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the impact of this massive tax hike on the economy would be severe, and could inevitably lead to an economic slowdown.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right.  Don’t you recall the massive recession that followed the 1993 tax increase?  If you do, I don’t seem to.  Mr. Factor then goes on to say certain Democrats have it all backwards:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Democrats have it exactly backward: Tax cuts should be the impetus for entitlement reform rather than an excuse to avoid it or expand the government.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Entitlement reform” is really a reduction in the Social Security benefits that folks have been paying for in the form of higher payroll “contributions” over the past generation.  Mr. Factor is actually advocating a backdoor employment tax increase.  But what else is new?</p>

                                <p>This one is by Reader Dan</p>
<p>Adopting best practice procedures in our healthcare system is complicated and deserves careful attention. Several problems come to mind immediately:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Determining what is best practice over time is problematic in general medicine, and often enough what is called best practice now later falls out of favor or is replaced by a ‘new’ procedure. <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/">Journal of Medicine Association (JAMA)</a> is a good source for this issue, but I do not have a subscription. <a href="http://www.thehealthcareblog.com/the_health_care_blog/2007/02/solving_the_mar.html">This</a> blog is worth a read. </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>2. Best practice is established and arbitrated in a variety of ways. A policy goal might be to help develop best practice and establish baseline quality as in the UK.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>3. Chronic conditions such as diabetes versus acute conditions such as heart surgery or use of stents plays an important role in how we allocate resources. Innovation is rewarded in particular ways that impact care and our health.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>4. Efficiency is gained in various ways, some negative and some positive, but to date costs are huge.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>5. Profit margins defines what is a medical problem and what is not in the form of research and insurance payment schedules. Maximizing % of profit margin appears to predominate as opposed to more marginal gains that might have better overall outcomes over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Incentives to treat soldiers are a huge issue:</p>
<p>Regulars know that I prefer starting with an example before I get to aggregates or huge policy issues. This one is dear to all our hearts I am sure. While this is specifically stated as a government oriented problem using <a href="http://www.military.com/benefits/Tricare">Tricare</a> insurance for military, retirees, families and others, it is not specific to government functions because private insurers are only marginally better in this arena.</p>
<p>EMDR is one of the most researched interventions round the world for PTSD and in particular combat PTSD. This best practice guideline recommending CBT and EMDR, published in March 2005 by the UK ’s National Institute for Clinical Excellence names it specifically as one of treatment of choice. Good general information is <a href="http://www.ptsd.org.uk/">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oqp.med.va.gov/cpg/PTSD/PTSD_cpg/frameset.htm">The VA system</a> approves its use finally at a late date in the research as one of four preferred treatments. Psychopharmacology is a resource mentioned. AMA, APA, NASW approve its use.</p>
<p>At EMDRIA’s (organization advocating the use of this method) request in 2005, <a href="http://www.emdria.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&#038;subarticlenbr=16">TRICARE did a review of EMDR for the treatment of PTSD</a> and concluded that the treatment was “unproven”. In April 2006, TRICARE agreed to do a “more in-depth review, but in an August 31, 2006 policy document TRICARE said that &#8220;EMDR is not psychotherapy&#8221;. The credential as regards innovation in our health system is for another post, but thought some might want to check the issue with their own sources (so I mention it here) since military in particular will be of interest to several readers.<br />With credential established, I find this interesting:<br /><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070610/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/soldiers_finding_a_therapist;_ylt=Al5XWVs_P02OKYtcmiEeG6us0NUE">Soldiers returning from war are finding it more difficult to get mental health treatment</a> because military insurance is cutting payments to therapists, on top of already low reimbursement rates and a tangle of red tape.</p>
<p>Wait lists now extend for months to see a military doctor and it can takes weeks to find a private therapist willing to take on members of the military. The challenge appears great in rural areas, where many National Guard and Reserve troops and their families live. To avoid the hassles of Tricare, the military health insurance program, one frustrated therapist opted to provide an hour of therapy time a week to<br />Iraq and Afghanistan veterans for free. Barbara Romberg, a clinical psychologist in the Washington, D.C., area, has started a group that encourages other therapists to do the same.<br />Instead of quoting from an article, from personal knowledge the problem goes like this:<br />
<blockquote>A psychologist or clinical social worker becomes specially trained and licensed for either treatment modality. Market rate without insurance in this area is pegged at $125-150/session. Insurance payment is a percentage of this market rate, or set at $89.50/hr./session for Blue Cross/Blue Shield of MA, and Tricare will pay a maximum of about $79 hr./session. The billing is done on face-to-face time, so the costs of billing and quality controls are included in this charge, with frequent attendant problems regarding billing procedures and changing quality control criterion. It is a significant cost factor in all insurance and more so in Tricare. Many therapists in this area do not accept this insurance, and many are not accepting any insurance as private practitioners. Remember most private practitioners pay their own health insurance costs (about $12,000/year family), rent, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are several problems involved, and I do not see either government or private health care dealing with it adequately. What are the incentives for a hospital (where conditions also are becoming much harsher in this area) or private practitioner to provide this service as a normal part of care? Is it important, and how should we respond?</p>

                                <p>This post looks at abortions: the number of abortions, the rate of abortions per thousand women age 15 to 44, and the rate of abortions per thousand live births. Figures are broken down by Presidency. Why abortions? I think most people feel that fewer abortions is better than more abortions. Some want abortions made illegal altogether, but others think the way to go is, as Bill Clinton said, to keep abortions &#8220;safe, legal and rare.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already had posts on abortion before. For instance, recently I noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/abortions-and-income.html">that the likelihood of abortions goes down as real income rises</a>. I also had an older post looking at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/abortions-and-unwed-mothers-by-numbers.html">abortions by Presidency</a>. This one is different in two regards &#8211; one is that the data goes farther back, and the other is that I&#8217;ve since learned to put graphs up on blogger.</p>
<p>So here goes&#8230;</p>

<p>What&#8217;s going on? Well, once abortions became legal following Roe v. Wade, the rate skyrocketed. More doctors and clinics became providers. But it leveled off during the Reagan administration. Since then its dropped&#8230; a bit.</p>
<p>The data very incomplete (only 2 years of GW&#8217;s term) but even if we assume Reagan&#8217;s leveling off was part of some natural adjustment process in the series, the fact that neither GHW nor GW beats Clinton&#8230; its at least suggestive that Republican policies (making birth control harder to come by, focusing on abstinence only education, etc.) are not better at controlling the rate of abortion than Democratic policies.</p>

<p>Correction.  Reader One Salient Oversight noticed that I had posted the same chart three times.  I have since made the correction.  Apologies.</p>
<p>Update.  I forgot to note the data source&#8230; all data comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0096.xls">the Census Bureau</a>.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post looks at the relationship between the tax burden and economic growth. Sadly, this one has no pretty graphs and pictures&#8230; so its relatively boring. Sorry. I&#8217;m just not inspired this afternoon. </p>
<p>Anyway, call this post a follow up to yesterday&#8217;s post on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-tax-cutting.html">tax cutting by administration</a>, in which we saw that Republicans are (no surprise) the party of cutting taxes, where taxes were measured as the total taxes other than social security collected plus changes in the national debt held by the public, all as a percentage of GDP. This measure of taxes takes into account the fact that a run-up on debt has to be paid off at some point.</p>
<p>In terms of Economic growth, the story is different. Beginning with Ike, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">Democratic administrations have tended to outperform their Republican counterparts when it comes to real GDP per capita growth</a> &#8211; only the best performing Republican administration, Reagan&#8217;s, performed better than Carter, the worst performer among Democratic Presidents. Regular readers know I&#8217;ve since then looked at real GDP per capita many different ways, the the relationship doesn&#8217;t seem to disappear.</p>
<p>Because the government can boost real GDP per capita simply by borrowing and spending, a better measure of economic growth is <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_19.html">real (GDP less change in the national debt burden) per person</a>. On that series, JFK/LBJ, Clinton, and Carter all outperformed their Republican counterparts.</p>
<p>The fact that Reps cut taxes more than Dems, and Dems have done better on economic growth, would suggest that tax rates and economic growth are positively correlated. In other words, higher tax rates, not lower, are associated with faster growth.</p>
<p>And a first pass at the data seems to indicate that&#8217;s true. The correlation between the % change from the previous year in our measure of taxes and % change from the previous year in real GDP per capita is 0.06699. The correlation between the % change from the previous year in our measure of taxes and % change from the previous year in real GDP less change in debt per capita is .34157, using data from 1951 to 2006. (I probably should have gone with 1952&#8230; sorry&#8230; I don&#8217;t feel like redoing it for one year.) </p>
<p>So a first pass would indicate that the correlation between percentage changes in tax rates and percentage changes in real GDP per capita was positive, albeit weak. In other words, tax rates and real GDP per capita tended to rise and fall in (weak) tandem. The relationship between taxes and real GDP less changes in debt per capita is somewhat stronger. </p>
<p>Note&#8230; I&#8217;m completely skating over the whole issue of what sort or mix of taxes makes the most sense, which is definitely not a topic for today.</p>
<p>But&#8230; anyone except a fanatic will readily admit when tax rates are too high, they discourage economic activity, and tax cuts will benefit the economy. Conversely, when tax rates are too low, they lead to more debt or too little government, and therefore a tax hike will be helpful. But what&#8217;s too high or too low? Who knows? What I do know is that taxes (not counting SS) plus the change in the national debt as a share of GDP ranged from just under 10% to just over 17% of GDP in our sample.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s look at how the % change in this tax rate is correlated with the % change in growth for tax rates that are low or medium or high for the observed sample&#8230; Here&#8217;s a summary of the results&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnHkD5umkOI/AAAAAAAAARQ/o2pg51LmH50/s1600-h/taxes+and+growth.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnHkD5umkOI/AAAAAAAAARQ/o2pg51LmH50/s320/taxes+and+growth.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>How do you read this? There are seven observations for which (Tax + Change in Debt)/GDP is between 10.5% and 11.5%, and the correlation for those seven observations between the % change in (Tax + Change in Debt)/GDP and the % change in Real GDP per capita is 0.07. The graph seems to indicate that as long as (Tax + Change in Debt)/GDP is less than 13.5%, raising taxes is correlated with faster growth and cutting taxes is correlated with slower growth. Somewhere above that point (and its not entirely clear where), higher taxes are associated with slower growth. Correlation does not imply causality, but there must be some reason Dems have faster growth than Reps, and the idea of a Laffer curve with respect to growth must fit with almost everyone&#8217;s intuition.</p>
<p>If we assume that 13.75% is the fastest growth point, based on what we saw <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-tax-cutting.html">here</a>, the following Presidents moved tax rates throughout their term in the direction most likely to lead to faster growth in real GDP per capita: Ike, JFK/LBJ, Carter and Clinton. The following Presidents favored policies that moved the country away from this faster growth point: Nixon/Ford, Reagan, GHW, GW. </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the same graph for real gdp less change in debt per capita has a positive correlation at every point but one&#8230; and the correlations tend to be stronger for most points (by far) than those on the graph above. I guess what that means&#8230; much of our growth rate has been funded by debt&#8230; but we knew that.</p>
