                                <p>The Census Bureau <a href="http://www.census.gov/const/newressales.pdf">report</a> released this morning showed January New Home Sale were still strong. In fact, on a Not Seasonally Adjusted basis, January 2006 was the strongest January on record. </p>
<p>Following is a graph of NSA January New Home Sales showing 2006 is a new record.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/640/janNHS.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/320/janNHS.jpg"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>The strong sales may be partially due to the generally nice weather in January (a similar argument has been made for the strong retail sales).  Also, New Home Sales is a heavily revised number and may be revised down over the next few months.</p>
<p>There is evidence that housing is slowing (see SA graphs: <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/02/january-new-home-sales-1233-million.html">January New Home Sales</a>), but so far there is no &#8220;crash&#8221;.</p>
<p>In previous housing slowdowns, the &#8220;bust&#8221; was a slow and steady process that lasted several years.  In <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/housing-after-boom.html">Housing: After the Boom</a>, I graphed the real and nominal price declines for several cities for previous housing busts.  For those examples, the bust lasted 4 to 8 years and the price declines were up to 40% in real terms.  I expect this housing bust will be similar in both duration and in the real price adjustment.</p>
<p>The rapidly increasing inventory of New Homes continues to be a major concern.  The following graph shows January New Home inventory.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/640/janINV.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/320/janINV.jpg"></a></p>
<p>It appears builders have been able to keep inventories down, as compared to sales, until the last couple of years.  From the Census report:<br />
<blockquote>The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of January was 528,000. This represents a supply of 5.2 months at the current sales rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>  The months of supply is the highest since 1996 (the end of the previous bust).  This appears to indicate an oversupply of New Homes for sale.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/02/merrill-lynchs-rosenberg-five-macro.html">CalculatedRisk</a> comes <a href="http://rsch1.ml.com/9093/24013/ds/50479419.PDF">Reassessing Hard Landing Risks</a> written by David A. Rosenberg of Merrill Lynch. I’m calling David a bear as he is not buying all the Pollyanna stories as to how great the U.S. economy is doing.  </p>
<p>There is a lot of material here but I especially liked his comments about the labor market:<br />
<blockquote>In fact, when we canvassed investors as to which statistic it was that altered their perceptions to such a degree, the vast majority said it was the drop in the January unemployment rate to 4.7% from 4.9% – the laggiest of the lagging indicators. Never mind that the entire decline was due to part-time youth unemployment sliding (in a sign of seasonal maladjustment), or that the labor force shrank for the third time in the past four months – which is not what the textbooks tell you should be happening when the labor market is brimming with confidence … To this, all we have to say is that according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were a total of 4.1 million job postings available in December. Yet there were well over seven million unemployed people actively looking for work (and another five million who would engage in a job search if they thought it would lead to success). So, you can’t blindly look at a 4.7% unemployment rate and draw the conclusion that the labor market is tight enough to generate accelerating wage growth when there are as many as three potential job seekers out there for every available position. This still sounds like an excess labor supply backdrop to us, one that is inherently disinflationary, and a key reason why we are concerned that the Fed is on the precipice of a policy mistake if it raises rates much further. We have yet to hear from one policymaker as to how it can possibly be that this is a fully-employed economy when practically every measure of organic work-derived income (wages/salaries from the NIPA accounts; employment cost index; unit labor costs) is running at slower rates now than they were this time last year. And, the fact that real compensation growth per hour managed to decline in each of the past three quarters to stand at -0.4% year-on-year, something that barely happens once every decade, is hardly a trend one would expect from an economy supposedly operating at full employment.</p></blockquote>
<p>CR emphasized “misconception #2”, but I have to ask those putting forth this notion that households are enjoying record net worth – have you folks calculated this series in terms of real wealth per capita?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>William Buckley says <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/buckley/buckley.asp">It Didn’t Work</a>:<br />
<blockquote>One can&#8217;t doubt that the American objective in Iraq has failed. The same edition of the paper quotes a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute. Mr. Reuel Marc Gerecht backed the American intervention. He now speaks of the bombing of the especially sacred Shiite mosque in Samara and what that has precipitated in the way of revenge. He concludes that “The bombing has completely demolished” what was being attempted — to bring Sunnis into the defense and interior ministries. <br />Our mission has failed because Iraqi animosities have proved uncontainable by an invading army of 130,000 Americans.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/02/prepare-noose-for-bill-buckley.html">Glenn Greenwald</a> welcomes Mr. Buckley to the reality based community.  Should we praise Mr. Buckley for finally noting the obvious?  </p>
<p><a href="http://talkleft.com/new_archives/014128.html">Talkleft</a> reminds us that: <br />
<blockquote>The current violence in Iraq was anticipated before Bush decided to take down Saddam. As these articles suggest, Bush and his confederates knew what would happen and they went ahead with their invasion plans anyway. They are responsible for this mess.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that Mr. Buckley fails to acknowledge that the reason many of us opposed that stupid decision on March 19, 2003 was that we anticipated it would lead to disaster.  Mr. Buckley’s own rag (the only accurate description of the National Review) tarnished folks who opposed this decision as traitors.  Of course, we will not get an apology for this crowd.</p>
<p>Then again &#8211; <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/02/26/kristol-war-not-serious">William Kristol</a> thinks we could have won this thing had the Bush Administration made a serious effort.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: While Kristol is now saying we should have had a bigger war effort in Iraq, back in 2002 he had suggested that the cost of this invasion would be at best 0.2% of one year’s worth of GDP.  So I was trying to think of something to say about this fellow’s positions beyond the obvious – that he is clueless.  Fortunately, <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2006_02_01_digbysblog_archive.html#114099319789496634">Digby</a> has said it for me.</p>

<blockquote>China made a decision over a decade ago to fix its currency to the dollar. This was before the massive explosion of growth and before the Asian financial crisis. They have managed one of the most successful hard pegs in the region, and it probably saved them a lot of grief during the crisis of 1997-98 … Yet, the fact that they had kept such a hard peg for so long began to work against them. With all that growth, people recognized that this exchange rate would not work forever &#8230; Most people also realize that a large sudden revaluation would be bad for China. This is a gradual process. Too gradual for some tastes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me concede two things – the term manipulation is not needed here.  We both seem to agree that the yuan needs revaluation and I’m certainly not advocating a rapid revaluation.  Secondly, Dr. Polley’s post in its own way is a nice summary of what Jeff Frankel has written on this topic – a paper we noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/how-undervalued-is-yuan.html">here</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/119011">Brad Setser</a> notes that Stephen Jen (not Roach as I originally wrote) is now arguing that China’s fixed exchange rate is creating more problems than benefits.  Brad also picks up on my comments about Chinese monetary policy:<br />
<blockquote>China isn&#8217;t importing US monetary policy.  It is importing a monetary policy that is substantially looser than the monetary policy here in the US.  Right now, key domestic interest rates in China &#8211; whether the deposit rate or the interbank rate or the PBoC sterilization bill rate &#8211; are well below US rates. </p></blockquote>
<p>OK, this is just a sampling of the latest on Chinese economic policy from Brad.  Enjoy the rest of his post.</p>

                                <p>There is wee bit in Michael Darda’s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200602220843.asp">latest</a> that I might agree with – but given the following, I have two questions for him and the rest of NRO Financial:<br />
<blockquote>If Congress doesn’t act to extend the 2003 tax cuts, tax rates on capital will rise, which would depress after-tax rates of return to capital and stunt growth … A sensitive-indicators approach at the Fed and lower tax rates on the factors of production would sustain and deepen the expansion. However, higher tariffs, a trade war, and a tax hike on capital could end it. In this vein, the Bush administration should take a stiff stand against protectionism in all its forms and lobby relentlessly for the extension of the 2003 tax cuts. Anything less wouldn’t be prudent &#8211; or pro-growth. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> why do the NRO pundits continue to lecture Chairman Ben on the virtues of tax cuts when most of us know that the Federal Reserve sets monetary policy and not fiscal policy?  </p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> if keeping tax rates low is giving people their money back so they can consume more as George Bush repeatedly says even as he is clueless as to how to reduce government spending, do the NRO pundits think an inward shift of the national savings schedule will lower interest rates and increase investment?  </p>
<p>OK – we’ve been done this road many times so let’s go to where Darda and I partially agree (with strong interest in partially):<br />
<blockquote>The neo-mercantilist flat-earth society, which includes members of both parties, doesn’t seem to understand that a fixed (and now sliding) peg for the Chinese yuan simply means that China outsources its monetary policy to the Fed … Fixity is the antithesis of manipulation, not the cause of it. Apparently a passing grade in Economics 101 isn’t a prerequisite for ascending to the U.S. Senate. As Nobel Laureate Robert Mundell recently argued, an appreciation of the yuan could impose deflationary pressures on the Chinese economy, fan tensions in rural areas, and cut China’s growth rate. The result likely would be slower Chinese growth and lower incomes, which would cut the demand for U.S. exports &#8211; precisely the opposite of the intended effect. While a modest appreciation of the yuan probably would carry few risks given the dive in the dollar’s value during the last few years, a significant appreciation would surely be deflationary. It is also quite telling that the strongest advocates of yuan appreciation (or tariffs on Chinese goods) never advocated a devaluation of the currency when China was dragged into deflation by the steady appreciation of the greenback. In other words, the protectionists in Congress want it both ways, which means they are both inconsistent and wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our partial agreement is in two areas: (a) we both oppose trade protection; and (b) we both love to cite the collected works of Robert Mundell.  But I suspect Darda and I have different views as to what these collected works should tell us.  Mundell examined the different implications of fixed versus floating exchange rates for the transmission of macroeconomic policies such as fiscal policy (which is not set by the FED), monetary policy (what Chairman Ben does address), and trade protection policies.  For example &#8211; under floating exchange rates, the fiscal stimulus from the Bush tax cuts would tend to be dissipated to the other nations such as China – which would mean it was not as effective at raising U.S. aggregate demand as much of the extra demand from the reduction in our national savings rate spilled over in the form of increased Chinese exports.  But the point about allowing the yuan to appreciate is a valid one – it would reduce Chinese aggregate demand and increase aggregate demand in the U.S.  But isn’t that the whole point of those who argue for letting the yuan appreciate – U.S. demand growth has been paltry whereas China’s economic growth has been very strong.  </p>
<p>But I have one last query for the advocates of a fixed yuan.  The price-specie flow argument of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume">David Hume</a> not withstanding, the growth rate for China’s money supply has not been the same as the growth rate for the U.S. money supply – in fact, its growth rate has exceeded 15% per year for the last several years – even with <a href="http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Sterilized+Intervention">sterilization</a>.  As <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/113297">Brad Setser</a> notes:<br />
<blockquote>In 2005, the pace of China&#8217;s reserve growth picked up (once necessary adjustments are made for valuation), the pace of sterilization picked up commensurately and the interest rates the PBoC paid on its bills stayed quite low.  That combination put less pressure than I expected on China to adjust its currency regime.  The core question is whether 2005 demonstrates that it is possible, in fact, for China&#8217;s central bank to sterilize (offset the impact of rising reserves on domestic money growth) $250 billion or so in reserve growth on a sustained basis. China seems to have pulled back a bit on sterilization during the middle of the year, allowing a pick-up in broad money growth and building up bank liquidity to buffer the Chinese economy against the impact of a 2.1% revaluation. </p></blockquote>
<p>Or as <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/10/is_greenspan_re.html">Mark Thoma</a> suggested – the Federal Reserve is responsible for U.S. monetary policy, not the monetary policy of other nations.</p>

                                <p>Perhaps you may recall the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/02/17/cia.leak.ap/index.html">greymail</a> tactics of Scooter Libby’s defense team. When Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald called the defense team on these tactics, the defense attorneys accused Mr. Fitzgerald of lying and were insulted by the allegation – even though the allegation is clearly true.  The latest tactic from the defense team seems to suggest that their client cannot be prosecuted by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/02/23/libby.charges.ap/index.html">Fitzgerald</a>:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8211; Lawyers for Vice President Dick Cheney&#8217;s former top aide asked a federal judge Thursday to dismiss his indictment on grounds that the special prosecutor in the CIA leak case lacked authority … The defense attorneys also said Fitzgerald&#8217;s appointment violated federal law because his investigation was not supervised by the attorney general.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Attorney General, of course, is Alberto Gonzales who had likely impeded this investigation when he was White House counsel.  Talk about being above the law.  This defense team motion is the height of arrogance, but can you blame them?  After all, trying to defend Scooter Libby against the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice is damn near impossible.</p>
<p>So let’s see how <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york200602231044.asp">Byron York</a> might pursue this impossible task:<br />
<blockquote>Fitzgerald Refuses to Show Evidence That Valerie Wilson Was Classified &#8211; The CIA leak prosecutor tells Lewis Libby it’s none of his business.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s the title of the latest spin from York.  He continues:<br />
<blockquote>Tomorrow CIA leak prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald and indicted former Cheney chief of staff Lewis Libby will meet in a Washington courtroom to fight over what evidence will be at the center of Libby&#8217;s trial on perjury, obstruction, and false statements charges. In the latest exchange of court motions between the two sides, Libby&#8217;s defense team is repeating its request for evidence concerning perhaps the two most fundamental questions in CIA leak investigation: Was Valerie Wilson a secret CIA officer when her name appeared in Robert Novak&#8217;s famous July 14, 2003, column, and what damage did the exposure of her identity do to national security? Fitzgerald has so far refused to provide any evidence touching on either question, at times shifting his reasoning as Libby&#8217;s lawyers pressed their case.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since York already knows the charges are perjury and obstruction – whether the leak caused damage to national security is not material to this case.  As far as proving Valerie Plame was a overt CIA officer, maybe Mr. York needs conclusive evidence that the earth is round before he takes his next cruise.</p>
<p>On a more serious note (after all – I have yet to read anything of value on this topic from the National Review), <a href="http://talkleft.com/new_archives/014122.html">Talkleft</a> reports on how the Plame whistleblowers (those who cooperated with Fitzgerald’s investigation) are being sidelined within the State Department.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I just came across an interesting paper by David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald entitled &#8220;<a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w11416">Happiness and the Human Development Index: The Paradox of Australia</a>&#8220;.  The paper raises a question of crucial importance to economists who think about development and growth issues: what measures should we use to gauge whether any particular group of people are better or worse off than people in another place or another time?</p>
<p>The paper by Blanchflower and Oswald uses survey data to try to estimate how happy people are in various countries, and to compare their reported happiness with their economic well-being as estimated by traditional measures such as income or the World Bank&#8217;s &#8220;Human Development Index&#8221;.  They find substantial variations between the official economic statistics and how happy people say they feel.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nber.org/digest/jan06/w11416.html">NBER digest</a> provided a bit of non-technical discussion about the paper last month:<br />
<blockquote>Some recent findings from statistical happiness research include the following, the authors note in their paper:</p>
<p>1. For a person, money does buy a reasonable amount of happiness. But it is useful to keep this in perspective. Very loosely, for the typical individual, a doubling of salary makes a lot less difference than life events like marriage.</p>
<p>2. Nations as a whole, at least in the West, do not seem to get happier as they get richer.</p>
<p>3. Happiness is U-shaped in age &#8211; that is, it falls off for a while, then stabilizes, and rises later in life. Women report higher well-being than men. Two of the biggest negatives in life are unemployment and divorce. More educated people report higher levels of happiness, even after taking account of income.</p>
<p>4. At least in industrial countries such as France, Britain, and Australia, the structure of a happiness equation looks the same.</p>
<p>5. There is adaptation. Good and bad life events wear off &#8211; at least partially &#8211; as people get used to them.</p>
<p>6. Comparisons matter a great deal. Reported well being depends on a person&#8217;s wage relative to an average or &#8220;comparison&#8221; wage. Wage inequality depresses reported happiness in a region or nation. But the effect is not large.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find these results quite compelling.  I&#8217;ve often wondered how much happier the average middle-class person in the United States is today compared to 1970 or even 1950.  It would take some convincing to persuade me that they are substantively happier.  Yet the economic profession&#8217;s standard measures of well-being (income, GDP, hourly compensation, etc.) show tremendous gains over time for the average person.  </p>
<p>One natural question that arises from this line of thinking might be this: if the measured economic gains that the average person has enjoyed over the past, say, 50 years aren&#8217;t making people happier, should economists and policy-makers even bother worrying about them?  Perhaps we should stop even trying to increase GDP or income or compensation, and focus instead on spiritual development, or the environment, or being nice to animals, or something else.</p>
<p>But I suppose that trying to increase income and GDP and so forth still makes sense, because even if they don&#8217;t directly make people happier, those measures of economic well-being do give people more possibilities, with which you can do what you want.  However, this paper does make you wonder a bit about how many important contributors to well-being our official statistics are ignoring&#8230;</p>

Bucks, Arthur B. Kennickell, and Kevin B.Moore</a> on the decline in average real household income and the very modest increase in real household wealth.  Their study also shows that wealth inequality has increased.  As <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2006/02/distribution-of-wealth-update.html">Tom Bozzo</a> notes:<br />
<blockquote>Also, the low official savings rate, which gets pooh-poohed in some corners, does seem to have translated into the more tangible weak results for holdings of relatively liquid financial assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Was Tom’s “some corners” a reference to NRO Financial who emphasize the increase in aggregate nominal wealth when they pooh-pooh the low official savings rate?  Of course, these FED economists seem to understand the concept of real per capita wealth, which is why they did not publish their findings over at the National Review.</p>

<blockquote>If the oil company executives want to put money on their &#8220;working assumption of $15-$30 per barrel,&#8221; then they should go short in the futures market. But if their goal is to maximize shareholder wealth, then they should make long-term investment planning decisions based on the futures price of about $60 a barrel. What the oil company executives are doing is equivalent to a mortgage banker making a home loan for 5 percent based on a &#8220;working assumption&#8221; that rates are going to eventually head down to that level. I don&#8217;t believe in a &#8220;windfall profits&#8221; tax for oil. But a &#8220;willful arrogance&#8221; tax might be in order.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems he’s been carefully reading the energy chapter of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/ch11-erp06.pdf">Economic Report of the President</a>.  <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/02/oil_at_1530_a_b.html">James Hamilton</a> examines real oil prices since 1970 and writes:<br />
<blockquote>The conclusion I draw from such calculations is that a random walk seems to be quite a good approximation to the dynamics of real oil prices</p></blockquote>
<p>It does turn out that there is a small chance that oil prices will fall below $15 a barrel by 2010, but there is small chance that they will rise above $230 a barrel by the same random walk model.</p>

                                <p>Yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">CPI release</a> showed that inflation continues to gallop ahead at a rather high rate, though once again, most of the rise was attributable to higher energy prices.  <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B401CB896-A782-48CA-8454-E0D04916491C%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">Marketwatch</a> offers this assessment:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) &#8212; U.S. consumer prices increased a larger-than-expected 0.7% in January, led by higher energy, food and housing costs, the Labor Department said Wednesday. The core consumer price index &#8212; which excludes food and energy prices &#8212; increased 0.2% last month, as expected. </p>
<p>&#8230;Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected the CPI to rise 0.5% in January, after falling by 0.7% in November and by 0.1% in December. In the past 12 months, the CPI has risen 4%. The core CPI is up 2.1% over that time, near the top end of the Fed&#8217;s presumed comfort zone, but this was down from 2.2% in December. </p>
<p>The personal consumption expenditure price index, the Fed&#8217;s preferred gauge for tracking inflationary activity, will be released by the Commerce Department next week. The core PCE price index has risen 1.9% in the past year.  With the CPI up 0.7%, real or inflation-adjusted weekly earnings fell 0.2% in January, the department said in <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/realer.nr0.htm">a separate report</a>. In the past year, average weekly earnings have risen 3.6%, but prices have increased 4%. Inflation-adjusted earnings fell 0.4%. Real average hourly earnings are down 0.7% in the past year.</p></blockquote>
