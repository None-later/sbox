<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/05/are-tax-cuts-good-or-bad.html">This post by Mark Thoma</a> is just too good not to steal wholesale.</p>
<blockquote><p>When Republicans complain about all the people who aren&#8217;t paying federal income taxes, and they&#8217;ve been doing this a lot lately, I get confused. And that confusion extends beyond the obvious fact that almost everyone who is employed pays payroll and other taxes so the charge that they don&#8217;t pay any taxes is misleading.</p>
<p>I thought Republicans liked tax cuts, and the more the merrier. If taxes were zero on, say, capital gains or dividend payments, would they be whining and complaining? I don&#8217;t think so. If inheritance taxes were cut to zero, would there be an uproar? We know there wouldn&#8217;t be, Republicans want these taxes to be zero. But when income taxes on the poorest among us are zero &#8212; and not all taxes, these workers pay plenty in payroll taxes, sales taxes, and the like, just federal income taxes &#8212; they get quite upset.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>As I should have noted yesterday, and <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/05/what_econ_blogg.html">as Arnold Kling discusses today</a>, sometimes the questions are as revealing as the responses.  And sometimes, the answers are suspiciously inconsistent.</p>
<p>Below is the graphic from my question for the Q2 Kauffman Economic Outlook: A Quarterly Survey of Leading Economics Bloggers.  Link to the survey press release <a href="http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/leading-economic-bloggers-see-improvement.aspx">here</a>, graphic results for the questions from Bloggers <a href="http://www.growthology.org/growthology/2010/05/blogger-questions-from-the-keo-q2.html">here</a>, and the general Kauffman Institute blog site, Growthology, <a href="http://www.growthology.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m failing miserably at developing a Macro model that supports the majority answer for all the questions.

                                <p>For readers&#8217; information, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11283">this study page 193</a> appears to be most comprehensive and recent (2005) on dispersants for oil (hat tip <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2010/05/05/oil_dispersants_poisoning_gulf?source=newsletter">Salon</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the most difficult decisions that oil spill responders and natural resources managers face during a spill is evaluating the environmental trade-offs associated with dispersant use. The objective of dispersant use is to transfer oil from the water surface into the water column. When applied before spills reach the coastline, dispersants will potentially decrease exposure for surface dwelling organisms (e.g., seabirds) and intertidal species (e.g., mangroves, salt marshes), while increasing it for water-column (e.g., fish) and benthic species (e.g., corals, oysters). Decisions should be made regarding the impact to the ecosystem as a whole, and this often represents a trade-off among different habitats and species that will be dictated by a full range of ecological, social, and economic values associated with the potentially affected resources. Comparing the possible ecological consequences and toxicological impacts of these trade-offs is difficult. First, each oil spill represents a unique situation and second, it is often difficult to extrapolate from published research data into field predictions, especially regarding the possibility of long-term, sublethal toxicological impacts to resident species (Box 5-1 provides definitions for most the common terms used in discussions of toxicological effects).</p></blockquote>

What could replace them? &#8230; <br />[snip]<br />One proposed solution is for these countries to engineer the equivalent of a devaluation – a uniform decrease in wages&#8230;<br />[snip]<br />There is a second solution: the exit of Germany from the eurozone or the division of the eurozone into two sub-regions&#8230;<br />[snip]<br />There is a third solution, which Europe may come to realize is the most promising for all: implement the institutional reforms, including the necessary fiscal framework, that should have been made when the euro was launched&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The eurozone experiment was, in effect, an attempt to speed up the graduation process through the carrot of the single currency and the stick of harsher bail-out rules. Instead of having to demonstrate fortitude and commitment through decades of surpluses and declining public debt levels (as for example, Chile has done), euro members were allowed to have their cake and eat it, too. &#8230; Greece could run up its public debt to more than 115 per cent of GDP. Even more stunning a figure is Greece’s total external debt to GDP, which is more than 170 per cent, counting both public and private debt. Prof Reinhart and I find that most emerging markets run into trouble at external debt levels of merely 60 per cent of GDP. &#8230;<br />[snip]<br />In our book on financial history, Prof Reinhart and I find that international banking crises are almost invariably followed by sovereign debt crises. Will the euro prove to be a firewall against this process, or a debt machine that fuels it? It is going to be extremely difficult for some of the peripheral eurozone economies to escape without large-scale defaults on their massive private external debts, public external debts, or both.</p></blockquote>

<p>YES VIRGINIA, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GREECE AND THE US</p>
<p>By Marshall Auerback</p>
<p>Many market analysts, commentators and economists claim to be having a hard time finding a metric in which the US is in better financial shape than Greece.  <a target='_blank"' href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/7301083/Greece-will-be-start-sovereign-default-domino-effect-warns-Ken-Rogoff.html">Ken Rogoff</a>, for example, recently warned that a Greek default would usher in a series of sovereign defaults, and suggested  recently on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/04/three_reasons_the_euro_crisis.html?ft=1&#038;f=1001">NPR</a> that the crisis also had implications for the US. </p>
<p>The historian, Niall Ferguson, made a similar claim a few months ago in the Financial Times, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f90bca10-1679-11df-bf44-00144feab49a.html?nclick_check=1">“A Greek Crisis is Coming to America”</a>. The cries of the deficit hawks grow louder:  Repent all yee fiscal profligates, before the “day of reckoning” comes. </p>
<p>Let’s dial down the Biblical hysteria a wee bit while there’s still time for rational debate. The action in the markets over the past few days in response to the intensifying pressures in the euro zone suggests that investors are beginning to differentiate between countries which are sovereign issuers of currency, such as the US or Japan, and non-sovereign issuers, such as Greece, or indeed any of the other nations within the euro zone.   The US dollar is rising in value, notwithstanding the federal deficit, whilst debt distress in the so-called “PIIGS”,  especially Greece, are intensifying, thereby driving down the euro to fresh 12 month lows against the dollar.  </p>
<p>The relative performance of various currencies against the US dollar is highly instructive in this regard.  Over the past 3 months, the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars have all registered gains of some 4% against the greenback.  The worst performer?  Not surprisingly, the euro, down 6.3% over that period.  Whether consciously or not, the markets are demonstrating intuitively that they understand the distinctions between users of currencies (who face an external funding constraint), and those nations that face no constraint in their deficit spending activities, because they are creators of currency.  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />That the US has the reserve currency is an irrelevant consideration here.  The key distinction remains user vs. creator. The euro zone nations are part of the former; Canada, Australia, the UK, Japan and the US are representatives of the latter. </p>
<p>Using “PIIGS” countries as analogues to the US, or the UK, as Rogoff, Ferguson and countless other commentators do is wrong.  Their faulty analysis comes as a result of the failure of deficit critics to distinguish between the monetary arrangements of sovereign and nonsovereign nations.  Any sovereign government (of which none within the EMU enjoy that status any longer) can deal with a collapse in revenue and an increase in outlays from a financial perspective without invoking the sort of deadlocks that are now crippling the EMU zone.  That is why, for example, the Japanese yen is not in freefall against the dollar, despite having a public debt to GDP ratio in excess of 200%, almost 2.5 times that of the US.  In fact, over the past few days, the yen has actually appreciated against the dollar.  Now why would that be the case, if the lesson we were supposed to learn was about the evils of “unsustainable” government deficit spending? </p>
<p>Fiscal sustainability has no relevance in a system where there are no OPERATIONAL constraints on the ability of a government to spend.  US Social Security checks will not bounce.  Nor will the Canadian or Japanese equivalents. Similarly, their bonds will always be able to pay out interest.  Note, that this doesn’t mean that there are no real resource constraints on government spending:</p>
<p>Let’s be clear:  anyone who advances the use of fiscal policy as an effective counter-stabilization tool is always careful to point out that these interventions can come at a cost. That cost could well be inflation if, as a result of the fiscal expansion, we reach full employment, resource constraints begin to appear yet the government continues to spend.  But if the economy recovers, tax revenues will increase and safety net spending will fall. In the US that means we will likely be back to “normal” with deficits around 2-4% depending on the state of the economy, which is where we’ve been for the past 30 years aside from 1998-2001. <br />Why won’t these deficits be inflationary?  As Professor Scott Fullwiler  noted in a recent email correspondence with me, once the recovery is underway and the economy gets to a significantly higher capacity utilization where price pressures could emerge, the deficit will be declining substantially, and be at least a partial offset, as the discretionary spending brought about by social welfare expenditures comes down. It’s axiomatic that the faster the economy grows, the smaller the deficit becomes unless the government continues to spend recklessly, which we certainly do not advocate.</p>
<p>And by the time we get to a point where we might have inflation, the deficit is back to 2-3%, which again is where we’ve been for the past 30 years while average inflation has been about 2%. Note:  inflation does not equate to default.  You and I could well buy credit default swaps on any country in the world, but we are unable to collect if any of the relevant countries register a positive rate of inflation – even a double digit rate of inflation – because inflation is not tantamount to default.  Nor do the ratings agencies recognize default in this manner.  Default is defined as a failure to perform a task or fulfill an obligation, especially failure to meet a financial obligation.  Inflation is NOT incorporated into the definition when it comes to questions of national insolvency.</p>
<p>By contrast, the talk of Greek default is prevalent across the markets and that is a reasonable concern in the context of the euro zone.  The default option is considered a foregone conclusion, even allowing for the massive 110 billion euro bailout, which was designed to inspire “shock and awe” amongst investors, but instead has simply engendered shock.  If Greece costs 110 billion euros to bail out, how much next time for Spain, Italy, or even France?  </p>
<p>If the markets have concerns about national solvency, they won&#8217;t extend credit.  And that is the problem facing all of the euro zone countries. Greece, Portugal, Italy, France, and Germany are all users of the euro—not issuers. In that respect, they more like any American state or municipality, all of which are users of the US federal government’s dollar. </p>
<p>And deficits per se will not create the conditions for default in the US.  If the US continues to run net export deficits, (all the more likely given the ongoing fall in the value of the euro), then if the private domestic sector is to net save, the US government has to net spend – that is, run deficits.  That is a basic accounting identity, nothing more, nothing less.  If the US government tries, under these circumstances to run surpluses it will first of all force the private domestic sector into deficits (and increasing debt) and ultimately fail because the latter will eventually seek to increase their saving ratio again.</p>
<p>And the same logic applies for Greece.  The call is for the IMF/EU package to reduce its budget deficit as a percentage of GDP from the current 13.6% to 8.1% in 2011.  How will they achieve that? Trying to engineer a reduction in the deficit via austerity programs (or freezes or whatever else one might like to call them) at a time when private spending is still insufficient to maintain adequate real GDP growth is a recipe for disaster. IT WILL INCREASE THE DEFICIT.</p>
<p>Consider Ireland as Exhibit A in this regard.  Ireland began cutting back deficit spending in 2008, when its banking crisis began to spread and its budget deficit as a percentage of GDP was 7.3%.  The economy promptly contracted by 10% and, surprise, surprise, the deficit exploded to 14.3% of GDP (http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-22042010-BP/EN/2-22042010-BP-EN.PDF).  We would wager heavy odds that a similar fate lies in store for Greece, given the EU’s inability to understand or recognize basic financial balances and the interrelationships amongst the various sectors of the economy in terms of how they impact one another. Neither a government, nor the IMF, can predict with any certainty what the outcome will be – ultimately private saving desires will drive the outcome, as Bill Mitchell has noted repeatedly (http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=9533#more-9533). </p>
<p>Why do we have huge budget deficits across the globe?  It’s not because our officials have all suddenly become Soviet style apparatchiks, but largely because the slower global economy has led to lower revenues (less income=less taxes paid since most tax revenue is based on income, and lower tax brackets) and higher spending on the social safety net.  Gutting this social safety net because we extrapolate the wrong lessons from the euro zone’s particular (and self-imposed) predicament constitutes  the height of economic ignorance.  It also reflects a transparently political agenda which the US would be ill-advised to embrace. The rescue packages, the IMF intervention and all the talk about orderly defaults cannot overcome the EMU’s fundamental design flaw.  Let neo-liberalism die with the euro.</p>

                                <p><strong>A Few Relationships Between Expansions and the Recessions that Follow Them</strong></p>
<p>by cactus</p>
<p>Good evening, and welcome. Last week I had <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/04/look-at-recessions-part-1-by-presidents.html">a post</a> looking at the recessions since 1929 (i.e., since the BEA began computing GDP data). Each recession was ranked according to its length and severity, and by the political party of the President under which the recession began.</p>
<p>This week I&#8217;d like to take a slightly different tack. This week we will look at how the length and severity of a recession are affected by the length and &#8220;growthiness&#8221; of the expansion that preceded it. Before we go on&#8230; data on real GDP per capita comes from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010">BEA</a>, which is available annually from 1929 to 1946 and quarterly thereafter. I did no smoothing &#8211; that is to say&#8230; for an event that occurred in January, February, or March of 2001, as an example, I used figures for Q1 of 2001. Recession cycle dates came from <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">the NBER</a>. OK. The preliminaries are out of the way, so ready, set and go.</p>
<p>The first graph shows the median annualized reduction in real GDP per capita as compared to the median length of the earlier expansion. Assuming I didn&#8217;t make a mistake (its 3AM as I write this) &#8211; the graph shows that in general, the longer the previous expansion, the less severe the shrinkage during the recession.</p>
<p><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S99es9T1uoI/AAAAAAAAABs/C4x5lJDndrw/s320/mike1.bmp"></p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t nearly as strong a relationship between the speed of economic growth during the expansion and the speed of the decline during the recession.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S99e2LhrPzI/AAAAAAAAAB0/8GZyWsAyDUU/s1600/mike2.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S99e2LhrPzI/AAAAAAAAAB0/8GZyWsAyDUU/s320/mike2.bmp"></a></p>
<p>(BTW&#8230; if you&#8217;re wondering, yes, count of previous expansion lengths = count of previous expansion rates + 1. This is because we do not have data on real GDP per capita prior to 1929, but we do know how many months there are in the expansion prior to the Great Depression.)</p>
<p>What about the length of the previous recovery. The following graph shows us that longer expansions typically result in shorter recessions.</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S99e9O30OJI/AAAAAAAAAB8/3ovJ8KAt1J0/s1600/mike3.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S99e9O30OJI/AAAAAAAAAB8/3ovJ8KAt1J0/s320/mike3.bmp"></a></p>
<p>There does not, however, seem to be a clear relationship between the speed of the expansion and the length of the recession.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S99fDVZH7_I/AAAAAAAAACE/LpmE8igeAgA/s1600/mike4.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S99fDVZH7_I/AAAAAAAAACE/LpmE8igeAgA/s320/mike4.bmp"></a></p>
<p>So&#8230; the speed of the expansion isn&#8217;t clearly related to the severity or length of the recession. However, the length of time between recessions does affect both the severity of the recession and how long it lasts.</p>
<p>Next week&#8230; the relationship between the recessions and subsequent expansion.</p></div>

<p><strong>The Deficit Commission</strong></p>
<p>Ever since Alice Rivlin spoke here at Wayne about her role on the upcoming Deficit Commission and her belief that we must cut entitlements, I have been worried.  This seems like the same center-right coalition to undo the New Deal that has been rampaging in the country for four decades now&#8211;reaganomics, and with no heart. </p>
<p>Digby, reprinted in the Huffington Post, commiserates, at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/feature/2010/04/29/economic_sacrifice_open2010/index.html">We (meaning you) Must Tighten Our Belts</a>&#8220;.  It is &#8220;interesting&#8221; to see that many millionaires feel quite at ease talking about the need to cut back on wages (blaming unions for the fact that owners have taken their businesses overseas where they can pay slave wages), delay social security benefits, tighten medicare requirements.  But if you talk about taxing the rich, the response is always that this will &#8220;kill competitiveness&#8221; and &#8220;make the country poorer because there will be less investment.&#8221;   </p>
<p>Funny, the bigger businesses get, the less competitive they seem to be&#8211;they become more like monopolies able to extract whatever they want from the consumer.  Have you tried to order flowers for Mother&#8217;s Day?  Every florist in a small town in Texas where my mother lives has the same national flower sales arrangements and pricing&#8211;so you can get an $8.00 azalea for $50 (plus $15 delivery).  What a scam.   It&#8217;s the thought that counts, but that thought costs more and more every year.  Then look at the banks.  I have a savings account with not a little cash in it at one of the big national banks:  it pays so little interest that the bank probably spends more on tracking the interest than it does in paid interest.  But their spreads are good&#8211;we lend money to them for practically nothing, but they charge an arm and a leg to lend it to the community.  And Comcast&#8211;don&#8217;t get me started on them.  </p>
<p>My problem, you see, is that I watched the movie Wall Street for the first time tonight.  Made in 1987, the Wall Street of Gordon Gekko&#8217;s &#8220;greed is good&#8221; was full of evil blokes who broke up companies because they felt like it and could make more millions doing it, no matter what it did to the workers.  But that Wall Street, with the LBO guys tearing up firms, was tame compared to the Wall Street during the Bush regime where groups of smart traders lived to suck the lifeblood out of their customers to make themselves rich.  </p>
<p>I have a friend who married a Goldman banker.  When the crisis broke, she was terribly offended that people thought the bankers shouldn&#8217;t get their huge bonuses. &#8220;We earned it&#8221; she practically screamed in her email to me.  &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t we get it when we worked for it.&#8221;  I remember thinking then, that something different had happened on Wall Street when even the relatively little fish in the big banks had that absolute sense of entitlement, but were quite ready to heap piles of scorn on the &#8220;welfare queens&#8221; and all those ordinary little people who had some sense of being &#8220;entitled&#8221; to Social Security in their old age.</p>

                                <p>Jacob Weisberg <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2252363">wrote</a> <br />
<blockquote>The assumption that the rating agencies knew their business, a key enabler of the subprime meltdown, is analogous to the view before the Iraq war that Saddam Hussein had WMD. There are a lot of people now who scoff about what an obvious fallacy that was and not many who can point to doubts expressed at the time. But even if Rubin had better understood the risks Citi traders were taking and been in a position to do something about it, he almost certainly would not have said, &#8220;sell the AAA-rated CDOs.&#8221; Nor would anyone else have.</p></blockquote>
<p>When Weisberg writes &#8220;not many&#8221; he means &#8220;none of the guys I hang out with&#8221; which means &#8220;no one who counts&#8221; or &#8220;none of the cool kids.&#8221;  <br />Via Brad DeLong who <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/05/credit-derivatives-as-weapons-of-economic-mass-destruction.html">wrote</a> “in addition to Robert Shiller and Dean Baker, three people who can point to doubts expressed at the time come to mind: Raghuram Rajan, Alan Greenspan, and me. <br />What are we, chopped liver?”</p>
<p>But that’s not 2 % of it.  The set of nobodies who don’t count included <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&#038;sid=ajdL7eUHeUro">majorities in the House and the Senate and George W Bush Jr.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>In September 2006, Congress passed the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act, after hearings and investigations that began in the wake of the Enron meltdown. The measure gave authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission to designate, regulate and investigate rating companies. </p>
<p>The law also prohibits notching, the threat of unsolicited bad ratings unless an agency is hired to assess a security. It also requires the rating companies to disclose any potential conflicts of interest.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is a law passed in congress tightening regulation of ratings agencies, because congress was concerned about conflicts of interests. Weisberg may have assumed that the ratings agencies knew what they were doing. Actually congress seems to have agreed, and decided that the ratings agencies knew they were cashing in their reputations as quick as they could.</p>
<p>But I mean who can keep track of every little bill signed into law.  </p>
<p>Notice he is talking about any time when AAA CDOs still had yields close to treasuries, that is not just the 1990s, when Rubin was at Treasury, but most of the period (including September 2006) when he was at Citibank.</p>
<p>That oversight isn’t even the grossest intellectual error in the brief passage I quoted.  From one sentence to the next “not many” becomes not “anyone.”  Obviously there were people effectively shorting AAA CDOs by investing heavily in CDSs on AAA CDOs.  One is named John Paulson who has been in the news a bit lately.  Andrew Lahde and Michael Burry are two others.  Weisberg’s claim “not have said, &#8220;sell the AAA-rated CDOs.&#8221; Nor would anyone else have.” Is false and anyone who has been paying any attention knows it.  </p>
<p>Weisberg sees no difference between saying a probability is low and that it is zero.  So if the probability that a financier picked at random sys “sell the AAA-rated CDOs” is low then it is zero.  I have one bit of financial advice – don’t take financial advice from Jacob Weisberg.   When talking about the financial crisis he assumes that low probability events never happen.</p>
