                                                                    </div>

                                <p>And other gems from those who wish to steal your retirement funds.  First, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/frum/diary022205.asp#056808">Mr. Frum</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nobody is denying that the bonds and notes in the Social Security Trust Fund are valid. Of course they are. But when Democrats make this point, they are turning what is really an economic question into a legal one. Yes, yes, yes, the bonds are a binding obligation of the United States government. But the Dems want us to believe that they are also a valuable resource for the United States government &#8211; and that is hooey.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Mr. Frum did not read Krauthammer’s oped.  But as he admits that the bonds in the Trust Fund are valuable, Mr. Frum says hooey to the notion that the promises made by the Reagan Soc. Sec. commission in 1983 have any legitimacy.  I guess this is about as honest as it gets – David Frum’s cronies have the legal right to rob the lock box.  Any objections?  Hooey!</p>
<p>Next, an odd exchange between Martin Sabo and Derrick Max from the <a href="http://www.socialsecuritychoice.org/">Club for Rich People</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. Rep. Martin Sabo (D-MN) announced this week that he will introduce a bill in Congress that he says will “guarantee Social Security solvency through 2080” by increasing the interest rate on Treasury bonds in the Social Security trust fund. Of course, Rep. Sabo appears to not understand that the Trust Fund is just an accounting device, and that the bonds are merely a reflection of what one hand of government owes the other. Paying ourselves more interest by fiat is just proof positive that the trust fund is meaningless. If Rep. Sabo really believes in this bill &#8211; why doesn’t he just double or triple the interest rate and increase benefits for retired seniors?</p></blockquote>
<p>Does Mr. Max think that interest rates on government bonds are set like intercompany interest rates among related party entities that wish to violate the arm’s length standard.  Congressman Sabo and Mr. Max should both realize that government bond yields are set in the market place.  And the suggestion that there is some big pot where the allocation of wealth between the General Fund v. the Trust Fund as it the pleasure of white collar criminals sort of validates Mr. Frum’s apparent desire to rob the lockbox.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">January CPI report</a> was released this morning by the BLS.  It was eagerly awaited by the financial markets, because last week’s <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm">PPI report</a> showed a surprisingly strong rise in producer price inflation in January.  As a result, many observers wondered if the CPI report would confirm a significant rise in inflation, or if instead it would suggest that the inflationary January PPI number should be taken with a grain of salt.  In the event, today’s CPI report will probably suggest the latter:<br />
<blockquote>The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.2 percent in January, before seasonal adjustment, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  </p>
<p>&#8230;On a seasonally adjusted basis, the CPI-U, which was unchanged in December, increased 0.1 percent in January&#8230; Energy costs declined 1.1 percent, following a 1.3 percent drop in December.  Within energy, the index for petroleum-based energy declined 2.2 percent while the index for energy services rose 0.1 percent.  The index for all items less food and energy increased 0.2 percent in January, the same as in each of the preceding three months.</p></blockquote>
<p>As usual, I will add the caveat here that any one month’s numbers are of limited importance due to the normal month-to-month volatility in most economic statistics; the bond market’s rather strong reaction to the January PPI report last week seemed to be considerably exaggerated.  A much better gauge of trends in inflation is the 12-month percent change in prices, which I’ve depicted in the following chart.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/cpi_ppi_jan.jpg"></p>
<p>Producer price inflation has indeed been on a strong upward trend over the past year (even excluding higher energy prices), and non-energy consumer price inflation has also drifted upward, albeit less dramatically.  So even though today&#8217;s CPI report was quite tame by itself, it&#8217;s clear that over the past year all broad inflation measures for the US seem to have moved solidly into the 2-3% range (the GDP deflator rose by about 2.4% over the four quarters of 2004).  </p>
<p>This raises some interesting questions, the most important of which is probably how much inflation the Fed is willing to tolerate.  Most inflation-targeting schemes (such as that of the European Central Bank) try to keep inflation <em>below</em> a maximum of 2% or 2.5%.  Yet the US economy clearly seems to be heading above those limits.  Furthermore, if the dollar falls further this year (particularly against Asian currencies), as many expect, then inflation is likely to rise even further from current levels.  </p>
<p>From an inflation-targeting point of view, therefore, it appears to be time for the Fed to enact a rather tight monetary policy with some aggressive interest rate increases, in order to stamp out any gathering inflationary momentum.  On the other hand, if the Fed <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> tighten more aggressively over the next few months (and I actually would be quite surprised if they deviate from their recent pattern of steady quarter-point rate hikes), then that suggests to me that Greenspan is significantly more tolerant of inflation than most of his central bank counterparts around the world.  Personally I have no problem with that (unlike the ECB, I think inflation of 3-4% is probably perfectly fine), but I wonder if the financial markets would agree&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NEW YORK &#8212; The dollar plunged, posting its largest one-day loss versus the euro since August and dropping to a seven-year low versus the South Korean won, as reports of diversification of official reserves again spooked the market.</p>
<p>Plans for South Korea&#8217;s central bank to diversify its $200 billion in foreign-exchange holdings, mentioned in a briefing from the Bank of Korea to lawmakers, didn&#8217;t necessarily come as a big surprise. The statement reflected official comments dating back more than a year that the bank was lowering the proportion of U.S. Treasurys in its reserve holdings.</p>
<p>But the publicity garnered by the Bank of Korea document on Monday and yesterday helped revive one of the looming concerns that pressure the dollar: that global central banks, discouraged by low yields and protracted declines in the value of the dollar, could start to reduce their adherence on the dollar as a reserve currency. That, in turn, plays into fears that the U.S. will struggle to finance its huge current-account deficit.</p>

                                <p>I’m for free trade, outsourcing, and free mobility of factors of productions – especially labor – as many conservative and liberal economists are.  Angrybear reader JackNYC provides us with <a href="http://www.nfap.net/researchactivities/studies/SocialSecurityStudy2005.pdf">another reason</a> to lower barriers to international labor mobility.  To be fair, however, higher labor force growth would be yet another reason to reverse the Bush General Fund trainwreck so we could actually increase national savings.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001171.html">Max Sawicky</a> has been documenting how some employees of the Social Security Administration are assisting George W. Bush in his attempt to destroy the program.  Max links to the presentation from <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/legislation/LockhartHearing_files/v3_document.htm">James B. Lockart III</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at this chart starting with its “earth is flat” slide #7, which is preceded by its earth is round slide #6.  #7 is the usual Bush spin that the system will go bust very soon with pressure on the Fund starting in 2008 and expenditures (E) exceeding taxes (T) as soon as 2018.  The 2008 crisis date is sort of like Don Luskin’s inflection point, that is when the first derivative of the time path for reserves (R) (the surplus) starts to decline.  Why the second derivative of R turning negative is a crisis point is not explained.  </p>
<p>But even with E exceeding T, reserves will continue to grow as a careful reader of slide #6 would see.  Slide #6 is not only entitled “Trust Fund Continues to Grow” but also provides the correct accounting for the annual rate of increase in reserves equals (T minus E) PLUS the interest on accumulated reserves.  By even the pessimistic forecasts of SSA, reserves will be near $7 trillion by 2018 so interest income will be around $350 billion – which means the Trust Fund will continue to grow until around 2022.  </p>
<p>Beyond contradicting himself, Lockart provides more gems.  Slide #10 shows that there will be no cuts in benefits for folks like myself (mid-40’s) and even for the Little Nells still in their diapers, their benefits will be around 70% of what the projections say.  Yet, the Bush plan to switch to price-indexation would have me losing around 10% of my scheduled benefits and Nell losing about half of hers.  So all workers would be worse off under Bush’s plan v. the status quo.</p>
<p>But how could that be?  Take a gander at slide 12, which is a pay-as-you-go (aka the 2018 just IOUs yahoos) interpretation of Social Security.  Lockart wants you to look past 2018 but why not look at his chart before 2018 – in fact, take the historical data back to 1983 when President Reagan and Congress decided to raise that payroll tax rate to 12.4%.  Lockart’s blue line is well below his 12.4% red line, which means that the payroll tax was well above what was needed under this pay-as-you-go interpretation.  </p>
<p>Now let’s go back and recall why President Reagan and Congress decided on this tax rate.  Was it to subsidize the massive General Fund deficits so as to use employment tax increases to fund reductions in tax rates on capital income as suggested by the George W. Bush minions?  Not according to President Reagan who told us it was to prefund the Soc. Sec. benefits of the baby boomers.  But now certain Republicans wish to say that was never true.  Odd that is we liberals who claim it was for prefunding, which means we are implicitly saying President Reagan was being honest in 1983.</p>

                                <p>Some interesting developments in the foreign exchange markets in the last couple of days, according to the <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/0d4e4aa8-84c5-11d9-a172-00000e2511c8.html">Financial Times</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The US dollar was sharply lower on Tuesday after South Korea re-ignited fears that central banks plan to diversify their foreign exchange reserves away from the greenback to include more currencies.</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea said on Monday that “as foreign exchange reserves increase”, the Bank would “diversify the currencies in which it invests”, as well as targeting higher yielding investments. Seoul has $200bn of foreign exchange reserves, the fourth highest figure in Asia&#8230; With the vast majority of these reserves held in dollar-denominated assets, the dollar is vulnerable to any moves by Asia to spread risk by reducing the proportion of reserves held in dollar assets.</p>
<p>Some countries, such as Russia, have already embarked on such a process, and amid concerns among currency traders that China and other Asian banks might follow suit, the Korean comments led to a general wave of dollar selling.</p>
<p>George Soros, the US investor, kept the pressure on the dollar by claiming that oil exporters, including Russia, were continuing to switch out of dollars, moving mainly into euros. OPEC nations have reduced the proportion of their reserves held in dollars during the past three years. And the Indian government could next week back a plan to use a portion of its $130bn of foreign exchange reserves to fund domestic infrastructure projects.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most likely these are just a series of minor developments that will have no serious repercussions by themselves.  But another possibility is that they are some of the first pebbles that start the avalanche&#8230;</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Eric Chaney and Richard Berner of <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/GEFdata/digests/latest-digest.html">Morgan Stanley</a> pose this question: Why haven&#8217;t oil prices fallen more in recent months?  Most forecasts made late in 2004 for oil prices had them falling in 2005 &#8212; Morgan Stanley&#8217;s forecast was for an average price of around $37/bbl &#8212; and yet they have remained stubbornly high, with Brent crude mostly stuck in the high $40s per bbl.  As a result, forecasts for 2005 average oil prices by Morgan Stanley and other market watchers are being revised upward by $4 or $5 per bbl.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly (at least to an economist), Chaney and Berner argue that there are two very familiar reasons that oil prices are higher than observers thought they would be just a few months ago: demand is higher, and supply is lower than expected.<br />
<blockquote>The key reason for these forecast changes is that oil markets are today much tighter than we thought.  New data from the February International Energy Agency (IEA) report show that global crude demand was 0.2 mb/d stronger than previously estimated in the last quarter of 2004 and that crude supply was slightly lower than prior data indicated.  Nor is significant relief likely soon: the limited global economic slowdown we anticipate (with world GDP growth slowing from 4.6% in 2004 to a trend-like 3.6% in 2005) will not be sufficient to ease oil-market tensions significantly in 2005.</p>
<p>On the supply side&#8230; non-OPEC producers are operating at full capacity and output is stagnant.  That has been a chronic issue for the past five years, and it has given OPEC market power as the swing producer.  But the problem has lately intensified.  For example, former Soviet Union (FSU) production was down 1% in January from a year ago, and we expect that Russian production growth will likely dwindle by half through 2007&#8230; [Also,] in hindsight, it appears that OPEC was literally operating at full capacity in the fourth quarter of last year, for the first time ever.</p></blockquote>
<p>Naturally such talk makes one wonder if the world&#8217;s oil extraction is actually at or near its peak (often referred to as the <a href="http://www.hubbertpeak.com/">Hubbert Peak</a>), or if instead we&#8217;re currently just seeing a temporary pause in the expansion of the world&#8217;s production capacity, which will continue to grow once the oil development projects that have been launched in the past few years come to fruition.  Given that demand will probably (barring a major economic setback to the world economy) keep growing at a steady rate in coming years, regardless of what happens to supply, the difference between these two scenarios could be quite dramatic.</p>

                                <p>For an interesting comment on my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/02/charles-krauthammer-whats-in-your.html">recent dialogue</a> with David Altig over Charles Krauthammer’s view that the Social Security Trust Fund’s assets are worthless piece of paper, see <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog">William Polley’s</a> <em>What Does It Mean to Default</em>.  Among the many very sensible passages is this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the Fed is really independent, it can honor its commitment without regard to the Federal government defaulting on its IOUs.  </p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, our Central Bank could behave very much like many private banks.  Of course, private banks hold an array of income producing assets beyond Treasury securities.  If a few of the entities that a private bank lends to defaults on their obligations, it is still possible for the private bank to remain solvent.  </p>
<p>The 2018-just-IOUs-yahoos, which Mr. Krauthammer seems to be a member, seem to think that the Federal government is on a default path.  I suspect David and William share this concern as do I given the enormous General Fund deficits and the total lack of will from this White House to change the course of its fiscal irresponsibility.  If this fiscal irresponsibility is maintained for another 20 years, the prospect of Federal default does seem to be a genuine problem.  </p>
<p>William is saying we might trust an independent Central Bank to honor its commitment even if we do not trust the Federal government to honor their commitments.  But there is still the solvency question, which goes to what income producing assets are held by the Central Bank.  While I reject Krauthammer’s disdain for seeing paper (financial assets) as an asset, one does have to wonder whether a private bank would hold 90% of its loan portfolio in the form of IOUs from a borrower that has significant default risk.  Yet, the Federal Reserve holds about $720 billion in Treasury securities out of a total asset base near $800 billion.  Its holdings in Mr. Krauthammer’s favorite asset – gold – are quite modest.  Then again, the Social Security Trust Fund holds all of its assets in the form of Treasury securities. </p>
<p>What are market interest rates telling us about the risk of Federal default?  As of February 17, 2005, the nominal interest rate on 20-year Federal bonds was 4.65%.  Even with this modest nominal interest rate on long-term Federal bonds, foreign Central Banks and private agents were willingly holding these IOUs.  </p>
<p>Of course, we all know that the market’s expectations of an entity’s credit worthiness can rapidly change, which is one reason why some economists have argued for an independent Social Security Trust Fund completing Al Gore’s call for the “lock box”.  If the Federal Reserve and this Trust Fund were truly independent, they could hold whatever portfolio of assets made the most financial sense.</p>

<blockquote><p>2042 is the fictional date for the fictional bankruptcy of a fictional trust fund. Let&#8217;s start with basics. The Social Security system has no trust fund. No lock box. When you pay your payroll tax every year, the money is not converted into gold bars and shipped to some desert island, ready for retrieval when you turn 65. The system is pay-as-you-go. The money goes to support that year&#8217;s Social Security recipients. What&#8217;s left over is &#8220;loaned&#8221; to the federal Treasury. And gets entirely spent. It vanishes. In return, a piece of paper gets deposited in a vault in West Virginia saying that the left hand of the government owes money to the right hand of the government. These pieces of paper might be useful for rolling cigars. They will not fund your retirement. Your Leisure World greens fees will be coming from the payroll taxes of young people during the years you grow old. That is why 2042 is a fiction. The really important date is 2018. </p></blockquote>
<p>If you really believe piece of paper called financial assets are worth nothing, I’ll gladly take all of your cash, funds in your bank accounts, and other financial assets.  In turn, I’ll even buy a week’s worth of groceries.  </p>
<p>Of course, this pay-as-you-go claim is based on the premise that President Reagan and Alan Greenspan lied to us in 1983.  Back then, the stated reason for increasing the payroll tax rates was that we would be pre-funding the Social Security Trust Fund to accumulate reserves for the retirement years of the baby boom generation.  Even though I’m a Democrat who did not vote for Reagan in either 1980 or 1984, I prefer to believe that President was telling us the truth in 1983.  But if Mr. Krauthammer and other fans of George W. Bush prefer to say that President Reagan lied to us – so be it.  Now they may not wish to make such a brazen claim – but then they should cease and desist with this 2018. nonsense.  Your choice Mr. Krauthammer.  And if you prefer to mail me those financial assets, I’ll even pay the postage.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://%20macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/02/are_federal_res.html">David Altig</a> makes a distinction between Treasury notes and Federal Reserve notes and tries to give Krauthammer more credit than I did.  David’s point seems to be that the overall Federal financing position does not add-up in the long-run.  Clearly, it does not so policymakers have the following choice: raise someone’s taxes or default.  Few economists would disagree with the issue being what are the distributional consequences of how this choice is made.  But this is more of a General Fund crisis whereas Bush and Krauthammer wish to pretend this is a Trust Fund crisis.</p>
<p>My complaint with Krauthammer’s rant was that its wish to dismiss paper as an asset, which would dismiss any financial asset as an asset.  David is right that Federal Reserve notes are the IOUs of the Central Bank.  But what backs these assets?  It’s not gold so much as it is Treasury notes.  So if the Federal government defaults on its IOUs, what does the Federal Reserve rely on to honor its commitments?</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/2005_02.html">Jesse Taylor</a>, comes the latest from <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/021805B.html">Arnold Kling</a>.  Jesse gave Arnold’s ranting a nice reply, but one little empirical matter here.  Arnold seems to think the rich have a high marginal propensity to save.  But Glenn Hubbard, Bush’s first CEA chair, often wrote that the rich have a high marginal propensity to consume.  What gives fellows?  Or is this like that old SNL commercial – it’s a desert topping AND a floor wax (tax cut to promote consumption AND boost national savings)?</p>
