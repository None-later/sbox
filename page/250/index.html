                                <p>Update: Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/12/cant-anybody-in-obamas-inner-circle-play-this-game.html">appears to confirm</a> that Obama&#8217;s inner circle would be best served by being placed in a circular firing squad, given live ammo, and being told to &#8220;do what is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plethora of disingenuous claims that Barack Obama &#8220;won&#8221; with the McConnell-Obama &#8220;compromise&#8221; are legend.  See, for instance, <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/12/obama-president-mcconnell-sucker.html">the idiocy of Andrew Sullivan</a> (of which Andrew Samwick is too generous when he describes it as &#8220;<a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/2071/white-house-white-board-tax-deal">poor political tactics</a>&#8220;; see also <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/12/aimai-on-mcconnell-obama.html">Brad DeLong</a>), and <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/re-examining-the-who-got-what-chart/">the Administration&#8217;s disingenuous &#8220;what &#8216;we&#8217; won&#8221; chart</a>.</p>
<p>The big question was how this is supposed to stimulate the economy. Those of us who argued that it would do damage noted that it was the first move.</p>
<p>Obama has so far played (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/can-either-james-kwak-or-mark-thoma.html">as I noted earlier</a>):  1 g4 e5 </p>
<p>Now, Mark Thoma discovers that he <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/12/cutting-social-security-to-prevent-cuts-in-social-security.html">really does intend 2 f3 and then will wait for the Republican&#8217;s next move</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The second part, now being teed up by the White House and key Senate Democrats, is a scheme for the president to embrace much of the Bowles-Simpson plan — including cuts in Social Security. This is to be unveiled, according to well-placed sources, in the president’s State of the Union address.</p></blockquote>
<p>followed soon by what may be the stupidest serious paragraph ever written by someone who isn&#8217;t Donald Luskin:<br />
<blockquote>White House strategists believe this can also give Obama “credit” for getting serious about deficit reduction — now more urgent with the nearly $900 billion increase in the deficit via the tax cut deal.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have always heard that the first Black President would be subject to an increased threat of assassination.  Only now do we discover that he intends to commit <em>seppuku</em>.</p>
<p>The optimistic version of his chances for re-election now appears to be the case presented by &#8220;Norman&#8221; in comments to my previous post (slightly edited for clarity):<br />
<blockquote>If &#8220;O&#8221; continues his so called compromise—giving in to whatever the right wants—doesn&#8217;t pull a LBJ and gets the nod in 2012, the Repubs nominate Sarah [Palin], then it&#8217;s quite possible he could win again. Only this time, the Republicans would be a deciding factor in the win. Why? Because they know he will cave on just about everything they ask for.</p></blockquote>
<p>The only quibble there may be the &#8220;just about.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb (cross posted at new dedicated (and partially funded) blog <a href="http://socialsecuritydefender.blogspot.com/">Social Security Defender</a>) </p>
<p>As part of the Tax Cut deal Obama cut with Republicans there was included a one-year cut of 2% of payroll out of the 6.2% employee share of the overall 12.4% of payroll sent to Social Security. This cut was ostensibly designed in a way that held harmless the Trust Funds, the dollars not being sent from paychecks instead being replaced by transfers from the General Fund. Plus the diversion is on paper only temporary. But in reality this deal not only should have raised red flags, it also should have blown reveille and set off the disaster warning klaxons. This deal represents a terrible danger to Social Security in at least two ways and is terrible policy besides. More below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>If the so-called Payroll Tax Holiday stood on its own, you could argue that it is mildly progressive in that for one year it reduced the taxes of everyone on their first $106,800 of income while paying for it out of taxes that are mostly incident on the top 50%. Unfortunately it effectively replaced the expiring Making Work Pay tax credit which directed all of its benefits to families making at most $70,000. The net result may be a tax hike for as many as one in three workers. The whole grim business is described in this Huff Post piece: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/10/obamarepublican-deal-coul_n_795187.html">Obama-Republican Deal Could Mean Tax Hike For One In Three Workers</a> by the appropriately named Ryan Grim. From my point of view the fact that the tradeoff was suggested by Republicans is all you need to know, millionaires will get a tax cut ten times of that of a single person working at FPL in a minimum wage job.</p>
<p>However this particular issue, however important from an economic justice and income inequality standpoint is somewhat peripheral to Social Security itself. And there are plenty of people more qualified than me to comment on it, starting with Mr. Grim, so over to them on this one. Instead I want to discuss two threats posed to Social Security, one that just brings the funding shortfall much closer in time and is pretty well recognized, and a second that is more subtle but presents an existential threat to Social Security itself.</p>
<p>The first threat is fairly simply stated: in today&#8217;s Washington D.C. there is no such thing as a &#8216;temporary&#8217; tax cut. As long as Republicans have anything to say about it (and since they are effectively calling the shots even before they take control of even the House) there is no such thing as restoration of existing levels of taxation after a &#8216;tax holiday&#8217;, instead any such cuts will be presented as a tax increase, in this case a massive one. Because they can and will play games with percentages. That is while the cut is presented as &#8216;only&#8217; 2% and so to reasonable minds would seem a small part of the revenue flow, it represents 16% of the total revenue flow generated by FICA payroll tax and a whopping 32% of that taken out of workers&#8217; paychecks. Moreover taking the employee share simply back to 2010 levels means an increase from 4.2% to 6.2% or a whopping 47% TAX INCREASE. That is you can expect Obama to get headline credit for a 2% cut but get blamed for a near 50% increase even though it is the same dollars in question.</p>
<p>The anticipated rhetorical spin is only the start of the danger. Social Security Title 2 (what we know as Soc Sec today) has always been a closed system, to paraphrase Lincoln &#8216;of the worker, by the worker, and for the worker&#8217;, having taken nothing directly from capital it owed nothing to capital. Moreover because of the way that its dedicated taxation and later benefit levels were set up it was largely insulated from the Budget and Appropriations process. While opponents of Social Security could and did play games with the 1% of cost related to Administration, an amount that is exposed to those processes, that game playing didn&#8217;t put the whole system at risk (though it caused a lot of misery on the Disability Insurance side, where Admin has always been scandalously underfunded). But in 2011 a very substantial chunk of Social Security income will come from the General Fund. And while it is always possible that the next Congress will just ease that General Fund burden by letting the &#8216;holiday&#8217; lapse on schedule there is no guarantee that they wouldn&#8217;t simply leave the 4.2% rate in place while cutting the subsidy from the General Fund and so blowing around a $120 billion hole in the income stream for 2012 and every year after. With the net effect of bringing the projected date of Trust Fund depletion back dramatically from its current 2037 date, perhaps as early as 2020.</p>
<p>Of course this might appear just too raw and hypocritical for the Republicans, that after crying &#8216;crisis&#8217; they did what they could to precipitate it, but it opens the door for other chicanery. For example the Republicans could offer to leave the 4.2% rate in place, lower the replacement subsidy by 50% and &#8216;compromise&#8217; by cutting future benefits in a way that offsets the other 50%. And then just repeat this exercise every year in their typical framing of separating &#8220;spending we CAN&#8217;T afford&#8221; (which always seems to be social spending) from &#8220;spending we can&#8217;t NOT afford&#8221; (which seems to be everything military and any efforts to raise revenues).</p>
<p>Social Security has been protected throughout its history by the wall represented by a dedicated payroll tax and a Trust Fund whose reserves were drawn from that same stream. This Administration just breached that wall, apparently in the futile attempt to show &#8216;seriousness&#8217; and &#8216;bipartisanship&#8217; which in this case translates to &#8216;willingness to screw your own base&#8217;.</p>
<p>This payroll tax holiday was a terrible policy choice to start with, continuation of Making Work Pay or direct transfers from the General Fund to workers would have been more effective and better targeted stimulus than a tax cut that also flows to millionaires. But the danger is not restricted to the direct breach in the wall. Instead there is a lurking Trojan Horse. Subject of Part Two.</p>

<p><strong>A Simple Explanation for a Strange Paradox: Why the US Economy Grew Faster When Tax Rates Were High, and Grew Slower When Tax Rates Were Low</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=261">Presimetrics</a> blog.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with my writing, you know that for years I have been covering the proverbial non-barking dog: the textbook relationship between taxes and economic growth, namely that higher marginal rates make the economy grow more slowly, is not borne out in real world US data.</p>
<p>Sure, there are a whole raft of academic studies that claim to show just that, but all of them, without fail, rely on rather heroic assumptions, and most of them throw in cherry picked data sets to boot. Leaving out those simple assumptions tends to produce empirical results that fail to abide by the most basic economic theory. This is true for data at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=253">national level</a> and at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?s=state+and+local&#038;x=0&#038;y=0">state and local level</a>.</p>
<p>Making matters more uncomfortable (and thus explaining all the heroic assumptions and cherry picking of data in the academic literature) is that the correlations between tax rates and economic growth are actually positive. That is to say, it isn&#8217;t only that we do not observe any relationship between tax rates and economic growth, in general it turns out that faster economic growth accompanies higher tax rates, not lower ones, and  doesn&#8217;t take fancy footwork to show that.  A few simple graphs and that&#8217;s that.</p>
<p>Now, obviously I sound like a lunatic writing this because it goes so far against the grain, but a) I&#8217;ve been happy to make my spreadsheets available to any and all comers, and b) others have gotten the same results on their own. Being right in ways that are easily checkable mitigates my being crazy (or a liar, for that matter), but it doesn&#8217;t change the uncomfortable fact that data requires a lot of torture before conforming to theory. And yet, that&#8217;s the road most economists seem to take, which explains why economics today is as useless as it is. It also speaks poorly of economists. The better approach is come up with theory that fits the facts rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried a few times to explain the relationship that I&#8217;ve pointed out so many times, but I never came up with anything that felt quite right. I think I have it now, and it’s very, very simple. Here goes.</p>
<p>Assumptions:<br />1. Economic actors react to incentives more or less rationally. (Feel free to assume “rational expectations” if you have some attachment to the current state of affairs in macro, but it won’t change results much.)<br />2. There is a government that collects taxes on income. (Note – In a nod to the libertarian folks, we don’t even have to assume anything about what the government does with the taxes. Whether the government burns the money it collects in a bonfire, or uses it to fund road building and control epidemics more efficiently than the private sector can won’t change the basic conclusions of the model.)<br />3. People want to maximize their more or less smoothed lifetime consumption of stuff plus holdings of wealth. More or less smoothed lifetime consumption means that if given the choice between more lifetime consumption occurring, with the proviso that it happens all at once, or a bit less lifetime consumption that occurs a bit more smoothly over time, they will generally prefer the latter. Stuff means physical and intangible items. People also like holding wealth at any given time, even if they don&#8217;t plan to ever spend that wealth, because wealth provides safety, security, and prestige, and for some, the possibility of passing on some bequest.</p>
<p>(If the first two look familiar, they were among 8 assumptions I used last week in an attempt to get where I&#8217;m going this time around. Note that I added two words to the second assumption. More on last week&#8217;s post later.)</p>
<p>Due to assumptions 1 and 3, people will want to minimize their tax burden at any given time subject provided it doesn&#8217;t decrease their lifetime consumption of stuff plus holdings of wealth. Put another way &#8211; all else being equal, peoples&#8217; incentive to avoid/evade taxes is higher when tax rates are higher, and that incentive decreases when tax rates go down. Additionally, most people&#8217;s behavior, frankly, is not affected by &#8220;normal&#8221; changes to tax rates; raise or lower the tax rates of someone getting a W-2 and they can&#8217;t exactly change the amount of work they do as a result. However, there are some people, most of whom have high actual or potential incomes and/or a relatively large amount of wealth, for whom things are different. For these people, some not insignificant amount of their income in any year comes from &#8220;investments&#8221; or from the sort of activities for which paychecks can be dialed up or down relatively easily. (I assume none of this is controversial.)</p>
<p>Now, consider the plight of a person who makes a not insignificant amount of their income in any year comes from &#8220;investments&#8221; or from the sort of activities for which paychecks can be dialed up or down relatively easily, and who wants to reduce their tax burden this year in a way that won&#8217;t reduce their total more or less smoothed lifetime consumption of stuff and holdings of wealth. How do they do that? Well, a good accountant can come up with a myriad of ways, but in the end, there’s really one method that reigns supreme, and that is reinvesting the proceeds of one’s income-generating activities back into those income-generating activities. (i.e., reinvest in the business.) But ceteris paribus, reinvesting in the business… generates more income in the future, which is to say, it leads to faster economic growth.</p>
<p>To restate, higher tax rates increase in the incentives to reduce one’s taxable income by investing more in future growth.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>A couple acknowledgements if I may. First, I would like to thank the commenters on my last post at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=256">Presimetrics</a> and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/why-economy-stubbornly-insists-on.html">Angry Bear</a> blogs, as well as <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/fundamental-fallacies-taxing-investments-reduces-investment.html">Steve Roth</a> for their insights as they really helped me frame this in my mind.</p>
<p>Also, I cannot believe it took me this long to realize this. My wife and I are certainly not subject to the highest tax rate, and yet this is a strategy we follow. At the moment, we are able to live comfortably on my income. As a result, proceeds from the business my wife runs get plowed back into the business. This reduces our tax burden, and not incidentally, increases our expected future income.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>What are the channels for QE2? In a recent post, <a href="http://macromarketmusings.blogspot.com/2010/12/hoity-toity-fed-people.html">David Beckworth outlines his frustration</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;<em>It has been frustrating to watch Fed officials explain QE2. The standard Fed story centers around the QE2 driving down long-term interest rates and stimulating more borrowing.</em>&#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>On the tip of my tongue, I can think of three direct channels: (1) the interest rate channel, which is the source of his frustration, (2) the wealth effect channel, and (3) the weak-dollar channel.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The interest rate channel: the Fed lowers current and expected real borrowing costs to firms and households, thereby stimulating domestic demand via increased consumption and investment. Clearly, this is the most clogged channel, as it requires increased bank lending and leverage build.</p>
</li>
<li>The wealth effect channel: the Fed drives up the price of riskless assets (bonds), forcing substitution toward risky assets (equities, corporate bonds, etc.), which raises household wealth (via asset price appreciation) and current consumption demand. This channel was highlighted publicly in <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2010/sac101004.html">October by Brian Sack at the 2010 CFA Fixed Income Management Conference</a>:&#8221;<em>Nevertheless, balance sheet policy can still lower longer-term borrowing costs for many households and businesses, <strong>and it adds to household wealth by keeping asset prices higher than they otherwise would be</strong>.</em>&#8221; In my view (see chart below), this has been the strongest channel through which Fed policy has worked.
</li>
<li>The weak-dollar channel: the Fed prints money, thereby debasing the currency relative to global trading partners. The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/12/AR2010111202859.html?sid=ST2010111206045">technicalities of a weak dollar policy</a> prevent the Fed&#8217;s actions as directly being a weak-dollar policy; however, the short-term effect on the dollar was quite strong. In the end, though, we see that the Fed&#8217;s policy has had no accumulated impact on the dollar to date (see chart below). This policy still has some time to work through, since the Fed only recently initiated its quantitative easing program again. Furthermore, it&#8217;s unclear to me how the dollar will play out in 2011 (perhaps another post), since it&#8217;s really a relative game: Fed QE versus the European debt crisis, EM inflation expectations rising, or the like.</li>
</ol>
<p>The chart below proxies the three channels using the 5y-5yr forward TIPS rate (1), the S&#038;P 500 equity index (2), and the dollar spot index (3). The value of each channel is indexed to the September FOMC meeting for comparability.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TQ5qaUETgFI/AAAAAAAADZE/vfi_zSInGg0/s1600/fed_channels.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TQ5qaUETgFI/AAAAAAAADZE/vfi_zSInGg0/s400/fed_channels.jpg"></a>The interest rate channel has been negative, as expected real yields increased 35% since the FOMC meeting, driving up expected borrowing costs. The wealth channel has been strong and positive. The S&#038;P 500 gained 9% since the September FOMC meeting date, but the gains really started earlier, as speculators front-ran the Fed decision. Finally, the dollar channel fizzled out, as the dollar index (against major trading partners) is pretty much flat over the period.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to hear your input regarding other potential channels for Fed policy. But the data has, objectively, been surprising to the upside. Thus the growth outlook has improved. The chart below illustrates the Citigroup economic news surprise index (compared to Bloomberg consensus), which turned to the positive at the outset of November.</p>

<p>The big banks got into considerable trouble doing derivatives trades&#8211;especially the credit default swaps where AIG was the major counterparty and the taxpayers ended up bailing out the Big Banks like Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>So surely one of the results of &#8220;financial reform&#8221; in the wake of the casino banking financial crisis would be utter and complete transparency about derivatives, correct?  One would think so.  But it may not be so.</p>
<p>For a detailed picture of the way the Big Banks have controlled derivatives trading in order to make it a lucrative noncompetitive market for them and a costly market for derivatives endusers, read the article in the Saturday New York times:  Louise Story, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/business/12advantage.html">A Secretive Banking Elite Rules Trading in Derivatives</a>, New York Times, Dec. 11, 2010.</p>
<p>As Story notes, there is an exclusive group of bankers that has a great deal of say about derivatives trading.  The theoretical purpose is to &#8220;safeguard the integrity&#8221; of the derivatives market.  The real purposes is to &#8220;defend[] the dominance of the big banks&#8221; which the banksters do by thwarting efforts to create transparent markets where end users get real information on prices and fees and comparable trades.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The CFTC chair wants to push for more transparency about the derivatives clearinghouses, which will have more power under the Dodd-Frank bill.  But the banks don&#8217;t want transparency&#8211;in fact, the group of nine banksters that is the subject of the article meets monthly with the ICE Trust clearinghouse, and has enormous influence and power over them. </p>
<p>But Republicans in Congress aren&#8217;t exactly supportive of financial reform, unsurprisingly.  They&#8217;ve gotten big contributions and backing from Big Banks, and they plan to push back against banking reform.  Apparently they think another crisis like the one that hit us won&#8217;t be so bad.  After all, the banks survived this one just fine (and are making billions off the very low funding costs available to them through the Fed, while charging their depositors and customers huge fees).  As did most of the multimillionaires who own substantial financial assets.  Apparently, those who want to ease back on banking reform don&#8217;t care much for ordinary Americans who are paying through the nose for credit and getting nothing for their deposits.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the piece on the way the Big Banks control the derivatives market by keeping the facts about derivatives trades secret.</p>
<p>In the midst of the turmoil, regulators ordered banks to speed up plans — long in the making — to set up a clearinghouse to handle derivatives trading. The intent was to reduce risk and increase stability in the market.</p>
<p>Two established exchanges that trade commodities and futures, the InterContinentalExchange, or ICE, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, set up clearinghouses, and, so did Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Each of these new clearinghouses had to persuade big banks to join their efforts, and they doled out membership on their risk committees, which is where trading rules are written, as an incentive.</p>
<p>None of the three clearinghouses would divulge the members of their risk committees when asked by a reporter. But two people with direct knowledge of ICE’s committee said the bank members are: Thomas J. Benison of JPMorgan Chase &#038; Company; James J. Hill of Morgan Stanley; Athanassios Diplas of Deutsche Bank; Paul Hamill of UBS; Paul Mitrokostas of Barclays; Andy Hubbard of Credit Suisse; Oliver Frankel of Goldman Sachs; Ali Balali of Bank of America; and Biswarup Chatterjee of Citigroup.</p>
<p>Through representatives, these bankers declined to discuss the committee or the derivatives market. Some of the spokesmen noted that the bankers have expertise that helps the clearinghouse.</p>
<p>Many of these same people hold influential positions at other clearinghouses, or on committees at the powerful International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which helps govern the market.</p>
<p>Critics have called these banks the “derivatives dealers club,” and they warn that the club is unlikely to give up ground easily.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>For many, there is no central exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, where the prices of derivatives are listed. Instead, when a company or an investor wants to buy a derivative contract for, say, oil or wheat or securitized mortgages, an order is placed with a trader at a bank. The trader matches that order with someone selling the same type of derivative.</p>
<p>Banks explain that many derivatives trades have to work this way because they are often customized, unlike shares of stock. One share of Google is the same as any other. But the terms of an oil derivatives contract can vary greatly.</p>
<p>And the profits on most derivatives are masked. In most cases, buyers are told only what they have to pay for the derivative contract, say $25 million. That amount is more than the seller gets, but how much more — $5,000, $25,000 or $50,000 more — is unknown. That’s because the seller also is told only the amount he will receive. The difference between the two is the bank’s fee and profit. So, the bigger the difference, the better for the bank — and the worse for the customers.</p>
<p>It would be like a real estate agent selling a house, but the buyer knowing only what he paid and the seller knowing only what he received. The agent would pocket the difference as his fee, rather than disclose it. Moreover, only the real estate agent — and neither buyer nor seller — would have easy access to the prices paid recently for other homes on the same block.</p>

<p>The Senate vote was 65-31. The House had passed an identical version of the bill, 250-175, on Wednesday.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama was expected to sign it next week, although the change wouldn&#8217;t take immediate effect. The legislation says the president and his top military advisers must certify that lifting the ban won&#8217;t hurt troops&#8217; fighting ability. After that, there&#8217;s a 60-day waiting period for the military. </p>

<blockquote><p>These days, China seems to play the same role in much of our discourse that Japan did two decades ago. We look at our own follies — which are immense — and then look at the Chinese, and ascribe to them all the virtues of foresight and determination we lack.</p>
<p>But just like the Japanese, the Chinese are human, and their policy makers are subject to the same kinds of confusion and inability to make hard choices that are part of the human condition. And Chinese macroeconomic policy is in the process of becoming a cautionary tale.</p>
<p>Basic economics says that by deciding to keep the renminbi undervalued, the Chinese put themselves <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/swan-songs/">under inflationary pressure</a>; and sure enough, inflation is rapidly becoming a serious problem.</p>
<p>But political considerations seem to be <a href="http://curiouscapitalist.blogs.time.com/2010/12/17/china%E2%80%99s-inflation-problem-and-the-perils-of-unconventional-policy/?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed:+timeblogs/curious_capitalist+(TIME:+The+Curious+Capitalist)">ruling out all the reasonable responses</a>. They won’t revalue, because that would hurt politically influential exporters. They’re reluctant to raise interest rates, because that would hurt politically influential real estate developers. They’re trying to impose quantitative limits on credit, but are finding that borrowers have enough influence to circumvent the limits. And now they’re trying price controls — which will inevitably come apart at the seams unless they do something about the underlying pressures.</p>
<p>It’s an edifying spectacle.</p>
<p>Now, <em>schadenfreude</em> should not lead to any complaceny on our part; China may be corrupt and unable to make sensible short-run choices, but in terms of fundamental inability to deal with long-term problems, we still have them beat hands down. Still, it’s worth remembering that all giants have feet of clay.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care: Hysterical Reporting</strong></p>
<p>Fox News ran a screaming intro and a scary bottom summary line on a story on some survey of physicians, claiming a majority of physician will quit, retire or work part-time.</p>
<p>Link via Yahoo:  http://news.yahoo.com/video/health-15749655/23362511</p>
<p>This is further proof that Fox News does not do journalism. The conversation eventually winds around and the expert really contradicts the story headline.</p>
<p>I have been spending a lot of time talking to people at the national level, and the one trend that is certain is the merger/sale of physician groups to hospitals and integrated networks, effectively making the physicians employees of a larger entity. The ownership of a private practice will fade like Marcus Welby MD (some of you may be too young to understand this popular culture reference).</p>
<p>PS: if you leave the link open you will see a story about Miley Cyrus puffing on a bong. Oh the horror.</p>
