<p>Senate Dems unveil their tax cut proposal</p>
<p> Senate Democrats, led by majority leader Harry Reid, unveiled a $26 billion tax-cut bill on March 26, 2012. See, e.g., Richard Rubin, Senate Democrats Said to Prepare $26 Billion Tax Cut Measure, San Francisco Chronicle (Mar. 26, 2012).</p>
<p>The proposal revives the lapsed 100% expensing provision for capital investments, extending it through the end of 2012 and would provide a tax credit for businesses that expand their payrolls this year.</p>
<p>The expensing provision is foolish, but it looks like Senate Democrats are more interested in playing the bipartisanship game than they are in good legislation. Why is it foolish? For several reasons.</p>
<p>1) there is already a (temporary) bonus depreciation deduction of 50%.</p>
<p>2) an expensing provision that applies retroactively to already-purchased capital equipment cannot, by definition, have incentivised the purchase of that equipment.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />3) providing this kind of additional break to large corporations is a corporate subsidy that has little to do with creating jobs and nothing to do with good tax policy. It has little to do with creating jobs because corporations will simply accelerate purchases to garner the benefit but may not increase production correspondingly. It has nothing to do with good tax policy because accelerated depreciation already allows deductions faster than economic lossm amounting to yet another pure tax subsidy for businesses.</p>
<p>4) Companies that need to purchase equipment in order to compete will make the appropriate decision to purchase based on company revenues and expenses, without needing a subsidy from the tax code. For businesses where some investment in capital equipment is expected eventually, it is likely that the provision will subsidize an acceleration of an investment that would have been done anyway, amounting to a mis-allocation of resources to garner the extra tax break, while temporarily available.</p>
<p>The subsidy for payroll expansion is at least more directly connected to a desired social goal of creating more jobs to reduce the unemployment problem and something that both small and large businesses can benefit from. The proposal calls for a 10% tax credit for the first $5 million of payroll expansion in 2012, capped at half a million. Payroll expansion can be either new hires or wage increases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the GOP-led House is planning about double that amount as an outright giveaway to business. Cantor sponsored a 20% tax cut for all businesses with fewer than 500 workers. Those businesses are not necessarily &#8220;small&#8221; and the provision is not linked to payroll expansion, as Schumer noted. Id.</p>

<p>Amar Bhide, who has written the classic, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Origin-Evolution-New-Businesses/dp/0195131444">The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses</a>, has decisively debunked the idea underlying the Obama Bucket Shop act, which is that public stock offering are an important source of funding for new businesses. </p>
<p>The problem is, as Bhide explained, is that academics focus on the easy to study but relatively inconsequential venture capital funded companies which look to IPOs as an exit. Bhide found that only 1% of new and young businesses were funded by venture capital. Similarly, his multi-year study of Inc 500 companies found that a comparatively small portion had VC backing, and even then, many got VCs in at a late stage, not because they needed the money but having the “right” VCs would lead to a much bigger premium when they went public.</p>
<p>Bhide found that most new businesses are based on an insight about an business opportunity that the founders discovered as employees (ie, they saw a market niche that incumbents were ignoring). <br />These ventures were funded by savings, friends and family, and credit cards. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Similarly, the idea of venture capital or stock promoter funding as some sort of boon for entrepreneurs is wildly overstated.  The value added of venture capital is questionable. It produces stock-market type returns with more volatility. A colleague who founded a successful venture capital firm left when it went to do a second round of funding (the junior partners stayed on). He gave a long form, compelling analysis as to why: when you actually went through the numbers, the returns to the entire asset class depended on the returns of a very few firms, and even at them, of a very very few deals</p>

<blockquote>Their research asks whether there’s evidence that lenders changed their behavior to meet CRA, Fannie or Freddie-mandated goals by:
<ul>
<li>making more subprime loans than they otherwise would have? </li>
<li>lending to riskier borrowers than they otherwise would have? </li>
<li>charging risky borrowers less than they otherwise would have?</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;If the banks were strongly influenced by their desire to meet affordable housing targets then they should have made more of the kind of loans that would qualify and less of the kind of loans that would not qualify. These relative changes should show up as anomalies in an otherwise continuous data pattern, but the researchers’ examinations of 722,157 securitized subprime mortgages made in California and Florida from 2004-2006 found no evidence of this.  The same held true for the other two research questions. Hernández-Murillo, Ghent and Owyang did not find that lenders gave lower (i.e. better) prices to borrowers falling inside the threshold vs. those falling outside. Nor did they find evidence that lenders lent more often to qualifying riskier borrowers (those who would go on to be seriously delinquent within the first two years after receiving the loan) than they did to riskier borrowers whose loans would not qualify. <br /><a name="more"></a>So, to recap, the subprime story went something like this: foolish borrowers borrowed and foolish lenders lent. The evidence appears to show that lenders did not change their behavior in order to hit the affordable housing targets that the government imposed on them. While the government’s programs to encourage affordable housing may have other flaws they did not, at any rate, directly cause the subprime crisis. Myth busted.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Health Care Thoughts: Innovation is Good Except&#8230;.</strong></p>
<p>  &#8230;. when it is not politically correct.  For a long time large employers have used self-funded insurance plans backed up by stop-loss insurance for large claims. I have worked with employer plans down to the 100 employee size.  Now small employers are trying to cope with fast rising conventional premiums by using self-employed plans with lower dollar stop-loss coverage. Insurance companies are crafting plans for smaller businesses.  </p>
<p>Well!  California politicians and bureaucrats want to outlaw these plans, not because the plans are necessarily bad for small business or employees, but because the plans do not meet the spirit and needs of PPACA. This insurance coverage is not politically correct.  Some big insurers support the state because they might lose market share in the small business market (the holiest of motives of course).</p>
<p>Prediction: Eventually small business employers will get sick of this and dump employees on state exchanges, assuming the exchanges can be organized and operated.  Writing legislation is easy. Implementing PPACA is not so easy.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Below Dan pulled a post questioning Jon Chait&#8217;s claim that US economist&#8217;s generally support a broader tax base and lower rates.  I am expert neither on taxes nor economists, but I will write at length on the question after the jump.</p>
<p>Before the jump, I must note that Chait made many of the points I try to make below.  His main point is that it is easy to propose base broadening in the abstract but hard to eliminate actual deductions.  I slipped into criticizing something he wrote in passing in the post Dan pulled over here, and I do it again after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>First I note that many prominent economists support a sharply higher top marginal income tax rate.  The figure 70% is not rare.  I am not prominent, but that happens to be the top marginal income tax rate which I support (from nostalgia &#8212; that was the rate during my childhood in the 60s a period of notoriously slow economic growth).  </p>
<p>Second, I think the consensus is a villager VSP consensus about what economists say (or should say or what economic theory implies or something).  Similarly the VSPs are sure that economics tells us that social security pensions should be cut.  Oddly many actual economists disagree.</p>
<p>Third, I support gradually eliminating the mortgage interest deduction, so, I personally also support base broadening (in addition to raising the top rate).  Here I will generally argue against base broadening, but I stress that I am making a case against it and not totally opposed.</p>
<p>Now for some discussion of actual policy.  </p>
<p>I think that it is easy to oppose tax expenditures (deductions, credits, exclusions etc) in the abstract for the same reason it is easy to support lower government spending in the abstract.  All are costly, but the justification for each is specific, so when one just thinks of the whole mess, one thinks of the costs and not the benefits. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that Chait thinks that most economists want to eliminate the earned income tax credit.  I&#8217;m sure he doesn&#8217;t.  That&#8217;s a tax credit, but it isn&#8217;t what he means at all.  Same for the child tax credit.  </p>
<p>My guess is that he wants to tax employer provided health insurance as income, but only a part of a transition to single payer.  Certainly, he isn&#8217;t for repealing the ACA and eliminating the deduction.  The logic of a broad tax base is to minimize distortions due to decisions made to avoid taxes.  But the huge distortion here is the problem of free riding by the uninsured.  Employers who pay for health insurance pay for the care of employees of employers who don&#8217;t.  Chait supports a mandate &#8212; that is an additional tax incentive to get health insurance.</p>
<p>Some economists might want to eliminate tax incentives to save such as IRAs an Keoghs (does anyone remember what Keoghs are ?  My dad has one).  But wait the problem with running deficits is that is that the illusion of wealth causes higher consumption which crowds out investment (only if the economy is not in a liquidity trap).  </p>
<p>Loopholes in the corporate tax code are proportionally much more important than loopholes in the personal income tax code.  But many make a whole lot of sense.  Surely we prefer corporations to reinvest profits rather than paying dividends (again the problem with just running deficits is crowding out investment).  We should especially like investment in R&#038;D since the investing corporation does not capture all of the benefits.  </p>
<p>Hmm I think I have covered a significant fraction of total tax expenditures.  So what is the cause of the near consensus for a broader tax base and lower rates(among VSPs at least).  Clearly a lot of it is that they don&#8217;t find the alternative attractive &#8212; that is if one is convinced that high tax rates have high dead weight losses, then one is morewilling to eliminate tax expenditures.  The alleged costs of high rates include avoiding genuine income to avoid paying taxes &#8212; reducing labor supply, reducing human capital investment and reducing saving.  The evidence for a large effect on labor supply is miniscule.  The human capital argument is that people study less if the increased salary mostly goes to taxes.  Again the evidence is very weak.  The remaining issue relates specifically to taxation of capital income and capital gains.  I think the special low rates are considered loopholes by the critics of loopholes.  I know some economists claim to have calculated significant dead weight losses due to genuine avoidance of genuine income.  I know how much they had to torture the data too.  But I don&#8217;t think that anyone is really convinced.</p>
<p>Rather, the problem with high rates is that they encourage tax avoidance for given gross income by making deductions and shelters and such like more valuable.  So we are back to deciding if such avoidance (which is often explicitly encouraged) is desirable.  It is generally the product of a political choice to encourage something.  If this was a mistake, it is a mistake for low tax rates too.  If it is a good policy, high rates make it more effective.</p>
<p>In any case, a higher tax rate does not imply that deductions must be more valuable.  It is possible to cap deductions (as Obama has repeatedly proposed) so, for income over $250,000 the deduction of x is replaced by a credit of 0.35x.  The incentive to find it is the same as now.  The new top tax rate can be anything.  There is no reason at all taxes have to be calculated by adjusting income then applying the tax function.  The almost universal conflation of the marginal tax rate and the marginal benefit to the taxpayer of a tax expenditure is not an error &#8212; it is a trick used by those who want low tax rates to suggest that lowering rates is the only way to reduce incentives to find deductions and shelters and such.  </p>
<p>OK now for my one field of expertise &#8212; lazyness.  I am not the world&#8217;s top expert, but people even lazier than me are too lazy to type.  I suspect that pundits (and some economists) consider the current tax code inefficient, because they personally would have to work rather hard to commment on it intelligently (my solution as seen above is to comment on it based on guesswork).  The efficiency is dollars raised per page of tax code.  The wasted effort due to complexity is their effort.  I think this is a factor.</p>
<p>I think another factor is the desire to find common ground.  A compromise based on lower rates and fewer loopholes appeals to lovers of bipartisanship.  They have nostalgia for the distant memory of Bill Bradley and Jack Kemp working together.  In particular, the argument against high rates based on incentives for tax avoidance leads invevitably to the proposal that the loopholes be eliminated.  This is a way to increase revenues which supply siders must embrace if they don&#8217;t want to be revealed to be total hypocrites.  Decades of experience have not taught many VSPs that supply siders don&#8217;t mind broadcasting their total hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Finally, I think advocacy of a simpler tax code appeals to people because it seems more horizontally equitable.  The logic is not utilitarian.  The idea is that it is fair for people with the same gross income to pay the same amount in taxes.  I don&#8217;t have any patience for this argument (I don&#8217;t care about horizontal equity &#8212; I care about equality).  It is based on the asusmption that, because it seemed once long ago that income was a good measure of ability to pay taxes, it is the only fair measure.  If you think the argument makes sense, think of the marriage penalty.  Should the marginal tax rate depend on individual income or family income ? They can&#8217;t both have some fundamental link with fairness.  </p>
<p>I think the extremely strong appeal is that everyone thinks of the clever sneaks who are paying less than we are (not of those even less sophisticated than ourselves who are paying more).  The thought that someone somewhere has more money to spare, yet pays less in taxes, is infuriating.  This is not a rational basis for public policy.</p>
<p>But by all means get rid of the mortage interest deduction, slowly, with plenty of warning, when the economy is back to normal.</p>

                                <div>As AB readers know, I’ve written quite a number of in-depth posts on the ACA litigation—on the individual-mandate provision and on other issues as well.  (The number, by my count, is at least 11,** including the one I posted yesterday, titled “Showtime At The Supreme Court”).  And for your reading enjoyment, and in honor the big show that will be staged at the Court during the next three days, I’m posting the links to all 10** of the earlier posts I located, below. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But in response to a comment by Coberly to “Showtime” post today, I summed up my analysis of the individual-mandate issue in three paragraphs.  Coberly wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div>Why, is there nothing then you can&#8217;t do in the name of the commerce clause?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Or is it a mystery known only to those who &#8220;actually know the law,&#8221; as opposed to those of us who worry about little things like civil liberties as they are actually experienced by, say, human beings? </p>
</div>
<div>I responded:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>There are limits to what Congress can do in the name of the Commerce Clause, but because medical treatment for uninsured patients, including those traveling from one state to another, requires cost-shifting of huge amounts of money, some of it interstate, a law like the ACA is within the Commerce Clause limits. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That’s not to say that there may not be some <i>other</i> reason why a statute that falls within Congress’s Commerce Clause powers is unconstitutional, and although the people challenging the constitutionality of the mandate don’t expressly say this, their “freedom” and “liberty” claim is really a claim that the mandate violates the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause under a constitutional-law doctrine known as “substantive due process.” (That doctrine also is the legal doctrine under which the Supreme Court ruled that states can’t bar the sale and use of contraceptives, and is the doctrine underpinning <i>Roe v. Wade</i> and <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i>, the opinion that struck down state sodomy laws as unconstitutional.)  But the Commerce Clause plays no role in this, one way or another. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sure, if the Court strikes down as beyond Congress’s authority  under the Commerce Clause a statute that requires people to do something or that bars them from doing something, then people are “free” to do or not do whatever the statute required or barred.  But that’s just incidental.  It isn’t less of an imposition on liberty for Congress to require people who can afford to do so to buy health insurance directly through the government by a tax under Congress’s taxing power (which is what the government does with Medicare) than to require then to buy it elsewhere under Congress’s Commerce Clause power.</div>

<p> While We Were Busy Discussing Other Things&#8230;.</p>
<p> &#8230;. <a href="http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/ADAregs2010.htm" target="_blank">the first major rewrite</a> of regulations for the <i>Americans with Disabilities Act</i> went into effect March 15th. Good news and bad news for workers and employers.</p>
<p> Overall, what I read looks achievable from an employer viewpoint, and the Obama administration has shown some common sense (building owners who spent money to meet the prior rules will not have to immediately tear up their buildings for modifications to meet new rules).</p>
<p>The bad news? The news regs for public swimming pools cannot not be met on time, and the administration has issued a 60 day reprieve to prevent the closer of most of the pools in the country. (Apparently there is not enough qualified equipment or enough service techs to retrofit tens of thousands of pools in any timely manner.) Eventually the administration may inadvertently shut down many of the therapy pools used by &#8230;.  the disabled.</p>
<p>The other bad news I see is the definition of &#8220;disabled&#8221; is now murky again, after the feds and employers and the courts worked for two decades to clarify the previous definitions.  This murkiness puts employers acting in good faith in jeopardy for litigation.</p>
<p>This will be progress if applied with common sense.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <div>Dan emailed me several days ago asking whether I thought I should write a preshow (my word, not his) post about next week’s marathon Supreme Court oral arguments on the constitutionality of Obamacare, a.k.a., the Affordable Care Act.  Six hours of argument, two each day, Monday through Wednesday, in which the Court will hear argument, first, on whether the courts even have “jurisdiction” (the legal authority) to even consider the challenges to the Act’s constitutionality before the challenged provisions of the Act have gone into effect, and, then, on the challenges to separate parts of the Act by various challengers who will be directly affected by the respective provision. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It promises to be a long three days.  And by the time Dan emailed me, I already was sick of reading previews.  I wrote back to Dan:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don’t think there’s anything to say, really, at this point.  There’ve been a zillion articles/commentaries about it within the last week or so, but they don’t really say anything.  Mostly they just kind of speculate about how Roberts, Scalia and Kennedy might vote, based on things like what Scalia wrote in a concurring opinion in a Commerce Clause case a few years ago (Scalia expressed an “expansive” view of Congress’s Commerce Clause powers), and how Roberts wants to be remembered. It’s obligatory writing for people like Adam Liptak, the NYT Supreme Court correspondent, but pretty pointless, really.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But two articles published on Thursday, one by former (longtime) New York Times Supreme Court correspondent Linda Greenhouse, who in retirement writes a periodic commentary column in the Times, and Slate Supreme Court and general-legal-issues writer Dahlia Lithwick, are, I think, worth reading. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Greenhouse’s is titled “<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/21/never-before/">Never Before</a>,” and the thrust of her article is that those two words—“never before”—are the sum and the (non)legal substance of the challengers’ arguments.  “Unprecedented,” she notes, “is a description, not an analysis.”  Or a legal argument.  It is instead merely a political argument.  And transparently so, which is why she predicts that the Court will uphold the statute, by a comfortable margin. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, actually, she predicts that the Court will uphold the statute by a comfortable margin because, well, for all the incessant hype, this is not, under extensive and pretty darn clear Supreme Court precedent relevant to each of the separate stated constitutional grounds argued, a close case at all—and because John Roberts cares a lot about how the Court is perceived during his tenure as its chief. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Or, more accurately, at least in my opinion, because under Supreme Court precedent this is not a close case and  this is too high-profile a case for its outcome not to impact the public’s perception of the Court.  By which I mean, and I think she means, that while Roberts &#038; Co. regularly make out like bandits in the night, hijacking the law and transforming it into reflection of a 1980s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Society">Federalist Society </a>checklist, they do so only to the extent to which they expect that they can escape widespread public revulsion.  Which in turn is determined by the extent to which the news media actually focuses on these ideological-agenda rulings <i>before</i> the Court issues the ruling.  </p>
<p>That, after all, is how we got <i>Citizens United v. FEC</i>.  Roberts &#038; Co. misjudged.  Oops.  Well, for heaven’s sake … I mean … y’know … who knew that the public would, um, actually <i>get</i> the <i>Citizens United</i> ruling?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Lithwick’s <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2012/03/the_supreme_court_is_more_concerned_with_the_politics_of_the_health_care_debate_than_the_law_.single.html">article </a>makes much the same point as Greenhouse’s—that as a matter of law, this is not a close case—but with a slight twist.  After giving a nod of recognition to the Greenhouse , which was published in that morning’s paper, Lithwick says that while she expects that the Court will uphold the statute, she’s not all that sure.  As a legal matter, she says, this case is not the case of the century nor of the decade nor even of this term.  Unless, of course, a 5-4 majority surprises almost all the legal commentators who actually know the law and follow the Court.   
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which, she says, wouldn’t surprise her all that much, because the case is not really about the law at all, but instead about “optics, politics, and public opinion.”  But ultimately, she thinks, Roberts and one or two of the others just won’t think this case is worth the cost in public opinion. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I agree.  It’s not as if they get to pick a president in this one.  There are, as Lithwick notes, other cases in their pipeline that could well do that. The oral arguments in those cases are, like the arguments next week, likely to be mere shows.  But with a more limited-release audience and opposite results.

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/449311-world-trade-and-output-set-new-records-in-january?source=email_macro_view&#038;ifp=0">Mark J. Perry reports</a> on the latest world trade data from The <a href="http://www.cpb.nl/en/world-trade-monitor">CPB  Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis.</a>    He presents a graph from 2000 on showing that the levels of world  trade and world industrial output have both reached new post-recovery  highs.</p>
<p>He takes this to be very good news, and draws some broad conclusions.<br />
<blockquote>Bottom  Line:     Both world trade volume and world industrial   output reached fresh  record monthly high levels in January.  Trade and  output are now far  above their pre-recession levels, providing evidence  that the global  economy has made a complete  recovery from the  2008-2009 recession.  For  the U.S., the annual growth rates for exports  (10%) and industrial  output (3.5%) reflect the underlying strength in  America&#8217;s manufacturing  sector. </p></blockquote>
<p>The graph tells me rather a different story.  I went to the source, got the raw data back to 1991, and made my own graph.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KiwsodxVupA/T2urrPWkK4I/AAAAAAAAByA/PBmu_8oZ3L0/s1600/World+Trade.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KiwsodxVupA/T2urrPWkK4I/AAAAAAAAByA/PBmu_8oZ3L0/s400/World+Trade.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<p>It&#8217;s  true that there has been a V-shaped recovery from the staggering  decline that occurred during the 2008 financial crisis.  It&#8217;s also true  that there is a new post-recovery high.  But I tend to look at graphs of  time series data in terms of trends, and have decorated the graph  accordingly.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>The green straight line is a lower trend line boundary, approximately  connecting all the dips.  The yellow straight line is an upper trend  line boundary, connecting the tops.  The purple line is an exponential  best fit through the peaks, indicated with purple dots.  Of course, in a  finite universe, an exponential trend must eventually end.  Even a  straight line expanding envelope probably can&#8217;t go on forever.  </p>
<p>Now,  it looks as if there might be a new top limit to growth.  The red line  connects the top just before the crash with the new top that Mr. Perry  finds so exciting.   If this holds, then going forward the data will be  contained in a collapsing envelope.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a close up view of the crash and recovery.  I&#8217;ve added some  purple lines connecting detail level peaks during the recovery.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UUu4vwq-h2c/T2vdNmdXPHI/AAAAAAAAByI/gzXF9MR7Y7U/s1600/World+Trade+2.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UUu4vwq-h2c/T2vdNmdXPHI/AAAAAAAAByI/gzXF9MR7Y7U/s400/World+Trade+2.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<p>The  purple lines appear to be approaching the red line as an asymptote.   Alternatively, the metric these points represent might be rolling over  and approaching another decline.  Either way, there is a clear loss of  momentum as the recovery ages.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a crystal  ball, and  I&#8217;m not going to make a prediction about the future of world  trade. But it&#8217;s clear that the historical trends no longer apply, and I  do not share Mr. Perry&#8217;s optimism.</p>

                                <p>Dan here&#8230;. Jonathon Chait <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/03/paul-ryan-obama-refuses-to-endorse-tax-fairy.html">writes</a> in the NYT <i>Paul Ryan: Obama Refuses to Endorse Tax Fairy</i>.  Lifted from <i>Robert&#8217;s Stochastic Thoughts</i> on journalistic rhetorical language and consensus:  <br />
<blockquote>on Chait </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>there’s not really a growing consensus that tax reform is good. The consensus has existed among economists forever </p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>where he defines tax reform as closing tax deductions and loopholes and lowering rates. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I comment </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Consensus among economists ? You must be joking. I am an economist and I absolutely oppose lowering rates whether or not loopholes are eliminated.  As to loopholes, well it depends. Should we eliminate the mortgage interest deduction ? Sure (but not yet &#8212; and not quickly &#8212; low housing investment is a problem now). The deduction for charitable contributions not so much. Tax employer provided health insurance when the Republicans stop trying to kill Obamacare (that is on the first of never). Eliminate the R&#038;D tax credit ? Why ? Are you nuts ? Eliminate the investment tax credit ? Why tax reinvested profits at all ? <br /><a name="more"></a>No one likes tax expenditures in the abstract (as almost everyone dislikes high government spending in the abstract). It is impossible to get a consensus once one discusses which deductions to eliminate (Chait went on to note this in the post). </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Chait has long supported broadening the base and lowering rates (he was a passionate enthusiast for the 1986 tax reform). The economists who basically agree with Paul Ryan have long supported tax reform. Most non Randian economists do to. But many of us don&#8217;t. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If you want to claim there is a consensus, show me a poll. Also one on just what should capital gains tax rates, tax treatment of capital income and top income tax rates. On the second set of questions, I am willing to bet a small amount of money at even odds that most members of the American Economic Association disagree with Ryan about the direction in which policy should change.</p></blockquote>
