<p>In a recent posting, I commented further on the lack of arguments supporting the corporatist lobbying drive for another &#8220;repatriation tax holiday&#8221; for multinational corporations that have stashed more than a trillion abroad (often through gimmicky transfers of intangible property such as rights to patents developed in the United States).  See  <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/10/repatriation-holiday-lobbying-money-speaks.html">Repatriation Holiday Lobbying&#8211;Money Speaks </a>(Oct. 3, 2011).</p>
<p>The reasons are manifold.  Corporations today are not cash-strapped&#8211;they&#8217;ve got lots of cash in the US too.   And even if they need cash that is currently offshore, they can borrow against that cash at exceptionally low rates today. So they aren&#8217;t investing in expansion that would create new jobs for lack of cash&#8211;they are not investing in expansion for lack of customers.  The middle class is collapsing, after four decades of reaganomics have steadily worked to erode unions and the empowerment they offer workers, leaving worker wages in decline while their bosses roll into the ranks of the superrich on their newfound ability to take an undue share of the companies&#8217; productivity gains.  Even when money is actually brought back (rather than already resting in US bank accounts), it is most likely to be used to pay even higher performance bonuses to top managers and to pay for dividends and share buybacks for shareholders.  And those shareholders are most likely merely to use it to make new secondary market share purchases&#8211;resulting merely in a net change in their portfolios&#8211;not direct funding of new enterprises.  Much of those secondary market investments are likely to be in emerging markets rather than in the United States. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Most telling is that the very fact of one tax holiday means that corporations will inevitably plan for and conduct business assuming future tax holidays.  It is ikely that planning for this current lobbying effort began on the day Congress passed the 2004 Jobs Act!  What that means is that <strong>the tax holiday itself encourages even more of the very offshoring activity it claims to be amerliorating.  C</strong>orporations will use gimmicks to move and stash away even more money offshore to avoid even more current taxes, in the hopes that there will be a further tax holiday that will allow almost zero taxation on those repatriated profits.  That certainly happened after 2004&#8211;the companies that had been good citizens and had regularly repatriated cash found themselves losers compared to the bad citizens that had used offshoring to avoid taxation.  More of the good citizens then became bad citizens, and the amount of offshore cash has grown much faster since the 2004 repatriation holiday than before.</p>
<p>And our experience with repatriation tax holidays was a telling one.  Corporate lobbyists worked hard to get the misnamed 2004 &#8220;American Jobs Act&#8221; passed with a very low tax rate for repatriated funds.  Yet it resulted in very little job creation. </p>
<p>(This is not surprising, since (i) corporate tax cuts don&#8217;t create jobs; consumer demand does and (ii) Congress didn&#8217;t put any real teeth in the job creation end of the legislation, such as demanding that any corporation repatriating cash and expecting the low rate establish that it had created substantial new jobs with the repatriated funds that were not on the planning board at the time repatriation was first introduced or when it was passed and that those jobs were permanent full-time domestic jobs.) </p>
<p>In fact, a new study by the Institute of Policy Studies addresses what it calls the &#8220;dangerous myth&#8221; that &#8220;corporate tax cuts create jobs&#8221; and the &#8220;disastrous results&#8221; of the 2004 tax holiday.  It reminds us that a government report found that 12 of the top repatriators brought home $100 billion (a third of the total repatriated under the earlier provision) and yet laid off 67,000 workers in the two years after the windfall.  Further, the 2004 holiday allowed 843 companies to use $312 billion in repatriated funds while avoiding $92 billion in taxes.  The worse factoid of all is the one that shows that U.S. taxpayers  &#8220;provided a huge subsidy to corporations that destroyed jobs&#8221;:  <em>58 corporations that accounted for about 70% of the repatriated funds  <strong>cut almost</strong> 600,000 jobs</em>.  Report at 6-7.  See <a href="http://www.ips-dc.org/reports/corporations_that_take_tax_holidays_slash_jobs">America Loses: Corporations that Take &#8216;Tax Holidays&#8217; Slash Jobs</a>, Institute for Policy Studies (Oct. 3, 2011) (summary, with link to full report). </p>
<p>The report is clear in its description of the way US corporations shift profits overseas and then lobby for even lower taxes.</p>
<p>Drug companies — and many other companies as well, especially in the technology sector — don’t just <em><em><em>make </em></em></em>profits overseas. They <em><em>shift  </em></em>profits overseas. The process has become lucratively routine. One example:  A U.S.-based corporation begins the process by having a foreign subsidiary register its patents in countries like Luxembourg that do not tax income from intellectual property. The subsidiary then charges its U.S counterpart a high price for use of the patents. These high royalty fees, coupled with the costs of research, marketing, and management, allow the U.S. operation to report to the IRS an artificially small profit — or even no profit at all. With no appreciable profit to report, the U.S. operation has no appreciable corporate income tax to pay. The company’s actual profits sit undisturbed with the overseas subsidiary.  Report at 11.</p>
<p>The report also scorns the lobbying efforts of <a href="http://www.winamericacampaign.org/">WIN America</a>, which has spent more than $50 million lobbying for the tax break, which would cost the fisc around $80 billion in lost revenues.  Report at 9-11.   WIN America&#8211;a coalition of 18 publicly traded corporations and 24 trade associations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce&#8211;has &#8220;hired 42 former congressional staffers who worked for the House Ways and Means Commitee or the Senate Finance Commmittee&#8221;.  Report at 9.  It goes on to rep9ort on the way individual members of the coalition have lobbied for the tax break (e.g., Pfizer&#8217;s sponsoring a favorable section on 60 Minutes) and cut jobs (e.g., Duke Energy&#8217;s cutting 10,000 jobs, probably as a result of its 2006 merger with Cinergy in the U.S., contributing to the North Carolina Democratic Party and then, shortly after getting support for repatriation from the Democratic governor of North Carolina and its Democratic Senator Kay Hagan).</p>
<p>For other commentary, see also John Carney, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/44773176">Corporate Tax Holidays Might Not Create Jobs</a>, CNBC (Oct 4, 2011) (commenting on the IPS report as well as the Heritage Foundation report discussed below).</p>
<p>The WIN America coalition was undoubtedly taken by surprise when the right-leaning Heritage Foundation came out with its own report, a &#8220;backgrounder&#8221; on taxes that condemns the repatriation tax holiday idea as not doing much to create jobs: J.D. Foster &#038; Curtis Dubay, <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2011/10/Would-Another-Repatriation-Tax-Holiday-Create-Jobs">Would Another Repatriation Tax Holiday Create Jobs? </a>(Oct. 4, 2011).    The Heritage Foundation report acknowledges that &#8220;<em>if another repatriation tax holiday were enacted, one should expect a similar result as last time: specifically, a surge in repatriations and little appreciable increase in domestic investment or job creation.&#8221;  </em>And it cites the reasons one would expect&#8211;today&#8217;s multinationals that have money to repatriate are not cash-strapped:  any investments that they need to make for business expansion purposes (that would create new jobs) they can do readily without needing a repatriation tax holiday to grease the skids.</p>
<p>By the way, the Heritage Foundation is resisting repatriation because it wants the big prize&#8211;an overall cut in the corporate tax rate and a shift from our current system of taxing worldwide income (after tax credits for taxes paid elsewhere) to a territorial system&#8211;and it doesn&#8217;t think repatriation will be treated as a step in that direction.  Those Heritage-supported tax policies would result in even more offshoring and even less corporate tax contribution to the fisc, which is already terribly low at around 2-3% of GDP.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the WIN America coalition struck back today, with a press release attacking its ordinary ally for not supporting the repatriation tax holiday drive: <a href="http://www.winamericacampaign.org/2011/10/04/fact-check-heritage%E2%80%99s-flawed-study-ignores-previous-support-repatriation/">Fact Check: Heritage&#8217;s Flawed Study Ignores Their Previous Support for Repatriation</a> (Oct. 4, 2011).  The coalition has three arguments: (1) Heritage said something different back in December 2010, (2) other studies say repatriation will create millions of jobs, (3) the 2004 Jobs Act really did work in spite of what these other studies claim because the firms themselves say they created jobs, and (4) lots of people support repatriation.  None of these arguments hold water.</p>
<p>The coalition first complains that a December 2010 Heritage study concluded that repatriation would &#8220;provide additional liquidity&#8221; that would increase shareholder wealth allowing them to make &#8220;new investments&#8221; and would permit the firms to finance current operations, reducing their need to borrow working capital.  Let&#8217;s parse this out.  The  primary reason that doesn&#8217;t make sense today (if it ever did, which is dubious) is, as the Heritage Foundation&#8217;s current report points out, that US firms are not cash strapped.  They don&#8217;t need more liquidity to be able to make investments or finance their current operations.  They probably don&#8217;t even want to reduce loans that are at historically low interest rates any more than they are doing.  And shareholders&#8217; &#8220;new investments&#8221;, as noted above, are just a move from one portfolio investment to another&#8211;they are not investments that encourage entrepreneurs or go to the working capital of companies but just a result of secondary market purchases.  Very little of that does much for the US economy or anything for creating new U.S. jobs.</p>
<p>WIN America counters that the August 2011 study done for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, <a href="http://www.winamericacampaign.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/The-Need-for-Pro-Growth-Corporate-Tax-Reform.pdf">The Need for Pro-Growth Corporate Tax Reform</a>, claims that a repatriation tax holiday will &#8220;speed the pace of economic recovery, increasing GDP by roughly $360 billion and creating approximately 2.9 million jobs&#8221; because repatriation tax holidays are &#8220;a private-sector approach to stimulus.&#8221;  That&#8217;s quite simply balderdash.  These same kinds of pie-in-the-sky claims were made about the disastrous 2004 repatriation tax holiday, and they were proven wrong then.  They are based on the same bad economics now, the economics that says that &#8220;the high U.S. [corporate tax] rate harms economic growth, the amount and quality of U.S. investment, and the wages of U.S. workers.&#8221;  That claim is simply unsupported&#8211;the U.S. is a tax haven, a reasonable amount of taxes will never discourage a business from expanding its business when it thinks that expansion is going to be profitable and it has the money to do it.  It is in fact this same school of economic thought that has given us the Laffer curve, the &#8220;rational man&#8221; calculations, and the rest of the Hocus-Pocus economics enterprise that treats rigidly unrealistic assumptions as God&#8217;s Truth to justify an ever-increasing share of corporate profits going to managers rather than workers. </p>
<p>WIN America then argues that 23% of the 2004 repatriated funds went to job creation and should be considered a great benefit to the economy.  That number is derived from a survey of tax executives&#8211;essentially self reporting on the result of the company-favorable tax repatriation holiday, so it is not only a very low return on the high tax cost of the repatriation tax holiday, but also one that must be evaluated with some acknowledgement of the fungibility of money and the ability of firms to claim that job creation and investment that they would have done anyway was done &#8220;because of&#8221; the repatriated funds.</p>
<p>WIN America concludes with quotes from lots of people (probably written by WIN America or one of its army of lobbyists, don&#8217;t ya think?).  These quotes just repeat the desired sound bites &#8212; &#8220;bringing the money home&#8221; will &#8220;create jobs and re-invest in America&#8221; (GOP representative Gregory Meeks, Sept. 9, 2011); &#8220;let&#8217;s bring those dollars back&#8221;&#8230; and &#8220;companies outght to put it into workforce training or they ought to put it into research and development&#8221; (GOP Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Sept. 14, 2011).  And so on.</p>

<p>INTELLIGENCE SQUARED DEBATE OFFERS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF ACTUAL INTELLIGENCE</p>
<p>I am reading a short article on the Intelligence Squared debate I previously referred to in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/social-security-for-young.html" target="_blank">Social Security For the Young</a>. It turns out they were more concerned with &#8220;insurance&#8221; than with Social Security.</p>
<p>But they don&#8217;t seem to understand the idea of insurance. The &#8220;for&#8221; side of the debate resolution: &#8220;Commitments made to seniors decades ago&#8230;saddle our children with unmanageable debt&#8230;&#8221; neglected to mention that Granny paid for those &#8220;commitments,&#8221; and there is no &#8220;debt,&#8221; manageable or otherwise. But granny didn&#8217;t get much help from the &#8220;against&#8221; side. Here are excerpts from the article <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/312411#ixzz1a6qBaLMN" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>One shocking statistic is that 37 percent of those who came of age in this millennium are unemployed,&#8221; Rosenkranz said. &#8220;When consumers lack the confidence to spend, when businessmen lack the confidence to invest and to hire, it is the young that suffer most. The health insurance debate focused on the uninsured. But think for a moment about how health insurance is priced. Almost everywhere the young pay the same premium as their more illness prone elders. A massive subsidy for the old paid for by the young. Tens of millions of young people quite reasonably said no thanks to health insurance until the government mandated that they say yes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The motion was that the young are being asked to sacrifice financially for the entitlement programs of the elderly, and the Conservative panelists argued in favor of that motion.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Arithmetic still matters,&#8221; Zuckerman began. &#8220;Medicaid now pays for both health and long term care for roughly 55 million Americans. It finances more than one third of all births in the United States, and pays the cost of almost two thirds of the people in nursing homes. The federal government underwrites 50 to 77 percent of the cost, depending on the income level of each state. Even so, Medicaid is the second biggest and fastest growing category of state spending. Costs are up more than 60 percent in the last five years and are expected to exceed $450 billion this year and to keep growing by about eight percent annually for the next decade. In the next &#8212; by the mid-2030s, the 65 and over population will nearly double, and health care costs, which have been rising far faster than worker productivity since the end of World War II, may be completely out of control, resulting in a tidal wave of federal spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the Liberal camp did not see America&#8217;s entitlement programs as something that needs significant renovation.</p>
<blockquote><p>The elderly used to be the poorest group in American until in 1926 the farm states where the Depression started began Social Security, which has then spread to a national program by Roosevelt in 1933,&#8221; Dean argued. &#8220;So this is a core program. We just need to make it work and we just need some mild tweaks. Health care needs a lot of tweaks, but the whole system needs tweaks, not simply Medicare. And we should stop victimizing Medicare for the sake of keeping our taxes absurdly low. The fact is people need to pay their fair share in America, and the Bush tax cuts need to sunset. You know, when the taxes were at Bill Clinton’s rate, the economy was a whole lot better than it is now. And I wouldn’t mind going back to those taxes and paying my fair share at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beginning with the fatuous remark by Zuckerman that &#8220;Arithmetic still matters&#8221; it seems to me that neither side understands what they are talking about.</p>
<p>Arithmetic only matters if you understand the problem you are &#8220;solving&#8221; in the first place.</p>
<p>I doubt very much &#8220;the young&#8221; pay the same for private health insurance as &#8220;the old.&#8221; But in the case of Medicare, and less directly Medicaid or any government paid health insurance, the whole point is that THE YOUNG WILL BECOME THE OLD. It makes more sense for them to pay a small premium, while they are young and healthy and working, over a long period of time, so that they will have paid in advance for health care needs that will come when they are old and sick and not working. THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF &#8220;INSURANCE.&#8221; 
<p>And that is the whole reason that government paid insurance is &#8220;better than&#8221; private insurance. It just is not possible for a private company to pay for health care forty years after the premium was paid in. Government plans, whether explicitly &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; plans for which the insured person pays directly, as Medicare is in part, or just a general &#8220;we are all in this together&#8221; plan where &#8220;on average&#8221; younger workers are &#8220;paying for&#8221; older people out of general taxes&#8230; but will be paid for in their turn when they become older&#8230; can manage this kind of infinite &#8220;pay it forward&#8221; financing with no problem at all. No problem except for the political liars who pretend that the young are bearing the burden for the old.. as a trick to fool the young into voting for someone who promises to lift the burden&#8230; and leave them to the mercies of the free market when they get old and sick and out of work.</p>
<p>
<p>The fact that costs are going up is not an argument FOR cutting your insurance. In fact it would be insane to CUT your insurance because you think costs are going to go up. With pay as you go financing the increased costs will be to some extent subsidized by the &#8220;next&#8221; generation&#8230; but that generation will have its own increased costs subsidized by the following generation. Moreover each generation will be richer than the last, making it easier for them to pay the increased costs. This is not a Ponzi scheme, because each generation will get the same good deal as the last&#8230;and it can go on forever. In fact, it&#8217;s the best deal &#8220;the young&#8221; can hope for.</p>
<p>
<p>Unfortunately Howard Dean&#8217;s remarks, as quoted here, don&#8217;t seem to address this simple fact. Rather he offers a kind of vague &#8220;we need to pay taxes to save the program&#8221; which is true, but doesn&#8217;t really help anyone understand why. or what. or how.</p>
<p>
<p>Go back to what Rosenkranz said at the beginning of the excerpt: &#8220;When consumers lack the confidence to spend, when businessmen lack the confidence to invest and hire, it is the young that suffer most.&#8221;</p>
<p>
<p>And what does Rosenkranz think will happen to consumer confidence, and ultimately to business confidence, when young people finally notice that without Social Security and Medicare they are looking forward to an old age that is desperate,poor, nasty, brutal, and short?</p>
<p>
<p>I would add an entirely personal comment: The purpose of arguments like &#8220;honoring commitments to granny&#8230; impose intolerable debt on the young&#8221; is three fold.</p>
<p>
<p>First, encourage &#8220;the young&#8221; to continue to believe they will never get old.</p>
<p>
<p>Second, take the young despise the old, and everyone else: &#8220;we don&#8217;t owe them anything.&#8221; We are all proud, heroic, individuals. We don&#8217;t need &#8220;cooperation&#8221;, much less kindness.</p>
<p>
<p>And third, enable the young to tell themselves that &#8220;commitments&#8221; don&#8217;t matter. Not just vague promises here, but commitments to give people what they paid for.</p>
<p>Someone more old fashioned than we allow ourselves to be would say this is the way to a society of anxiety, pain, and misery. Pleasures, perhaps, for the &#8220;winners,&#8221; but no happiness at all, for anyone, win or lose.</p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/10/repatriation-tax-holiday-win-america-is-pushing-hard.html">Repatriation Tax Holiday&#8211;WIN America is pushing hard&#8230;</a>
<p>I get a press release a day from WIN America, the coalition of almost two dozen multinationals and about two dozen business organizations (like the Chamber of Commerce) that is pushing for another big &#8220;repatriation holiday&#8221; tax cut for the multinationals.</p>
<p>Now they&#8217;re touting the Hagan-McCain Foreign Earnings Reinvestment Act with lots of quotes from those that are on board . </p>
<p>Most are unsurprising members of the right-leaning arm of the GOP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Douglas Holtz-Eakin wants &#8220;private-sector driven initiatives&#8221; and claims repatriation represents &#8220;a welcome step in the right direction&#8221; by meeting &#8220;near-term needs for more jobs and &#8230;long-term creation of a competitive tax code.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Nah.  A repatriation holiday, in the first place, isn&#8217;t a &#8220;private-sector&#8221; initiative.  It is government policy acting to single out multinationals for a special tax break compared to the current rules.  That is as much a public as a private action.  And nothing about the tax holiday is likely to lead to much &#8220;near-term&#8221; job creation&#8211;maybe a few, but at a steep price.  <a name="more"></a>  And it certainly hasn&#8217;t got anything to do with reasonable changes to the tax code.  It isn&#8217;t clear, to start with, that &#8220;competitive tax code&#8221; is a goal we should be striving for.  Who are we helping compete with whom, if we design our tax code for &#8220;competitiveness&#8221; rather than for fair taxation?  Note that the demand for government to create a &#8220;competitive tax code&#8221; is essentially a demand that government intervene to establish special market rules for multinationals that will work in their favor (letting them have more money)&#8230;..</p>
<p>Holtz-Eakin, by the way, was paid by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to write a report on the repatriation tax holiday.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eric Cantor claims &#8220;American companies currently pay one of the highest tax rates in the world&#8221; and that repatriation &#8220;will spur investment, economic growth, and job creation&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the first, the answer is clearly no.  US companies have slightly higher than average statutory federal income tax rate, but they don&#8217;t pay that tax rate on their economic income.  The majority don&#8217;t pay any federal income tax most of the time.  Those that do may pay at an effective tax rate of around 20-25%, but even that is likely an overstatement because of the way they can manipulate income.  We don&#8217;t have a VAT here, as most European countries do.  There are just about as many state loopholes as federal tax loopholes.  etc&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>On the second, the assessment is clearly no.  The last (supposedly ONLY) repatriation holiday in 2004 was an expensive bust, costing the fisc more than 60 billion and mostly going to share buybacks that merely changed shareholders&#8217; investment portfolios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kevin Brady says repatriation will allow US multinationals to &#8220;invest in jobs and expand their businesses in our backyard.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this is the same argument that was made for the failed 2004 repatriation effort.  It is even weaker this time around, because companies have even more cash.  They can already do whatever investing they really want to do in their U.S. business.  A repatriation provision without any teeth (to require proof of new US jobs that wouldn&#8217;t have been created without it&#8211;taking into account, that is, the fungibility of money&#8211; and to clawback the tax benefit without the proof) is just another corporatist giveaway.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grover Norquist (the &#8220;no new taxes ever no matter what&#8221; president of Americans for Ending Earned Benefits&#8211;oops, Americans for Tax Reform) says that &#8220;Repatriation is simply too good of an idea not to do&#8221; because the 2004 deal brought back billions &#8220;from locked up overseas accounts&#8221; and it can be accomplished &#8220;without Congress spending a dime&#8221; so &#8220;[t]here is literally no downside to doing this.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrong, wrong, and wrong.  First, as noted repeatedly, there is miniscule good in the repatriation idea.  A much better job creator would be to dedicate the $80 billion from repatriated fund taxes over the next ten years to direct jobs programs (like the New Deals CCC, etc.) building infrastructure.   Second, repatriated funds aren&#8217;t &#8220;locked out&#8221; overseas&#8211;they may be sitting in U.S. bank accounts in the foreign affiliate&#8217;s name, or sitting in U.S. investments in the foreign affiliate&#8217;s name.  And even if they aren&#8217;t actually already in the US (so &#8220;bringing them home&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t add a penny more to the cash awash in the country), the parent can bring them home already at very low tax cost&#8211;the $80 billion over ten years shows that there isn&#8217;t a huge tax cost to repatriating funds.  That&#8217;s because multinationals get a foreign tax credit, and the Bush tax cuts included a host of provisions that were corporate-friendly, including modifications to the way the credit works to make it much easier to use credits against US income.  Further, even if these cash-rich US multinationals need a little more money for a planned investment, they can borrow against their assets now at exceptionally low rates.  Third, a tax holiday is not a freebie that doesn&#8217;t cost the fisc.  Grover Norquist of course knows all about tax expenditures, but he also knows that most Americans don&#8217;t.  This is PR and nothing else.  That $80 billion would either fund needed programs (see above) or help the US avoid an additional $80 billion deficit.  And that&#8217;s really important, since the rightwingers are intent on using every deficit dollar to support their goal of decimating the earned benefits programs established in the New Deal.</p>
<p>But there are several on the &#8220;quotes&#8221; list that are disappointing, at least.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simon Rosenberg, Founder of the New Democrat Network, says &#8220;The Foreign Earnings Reinvestment Act is smart public policy&#8230;[that will help bring hundreds of billions back home, to be invested in the United States.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing progressive about a corporatist provision that puts money in the hands of the biggest multinationals that have most easily used gimmicks with the intended purpose of offshoring profits to avoid U.S. tax.  (Unfamiliar readers might look at prior posts about repatriation and the transfer pricing gimmick on intangible intellectual property &#8216;sales&#8217; to foreign affiliates.)  As noted, this extra money from avoided taxes is most likely not to be used to create jobs (they can do that already if they want to) but to be paid out in bonuses for improved performance to already excessively overpaid managers and in share buybacks to (mostly wealthy) shareholders with the primary result of portfolio diversification that may in fact lead to more investment of those dollars offshore in emerging markets.</p>
<p>Rosenberg claims to espouse &#8220;new progressive&#8221; ideas.  But folks, there isn&#8217;t anything progressive about a repatriation holiday&#8211;it&#8217;s just more favors for Big Money.</p>
<ul>
<li>Barbara Boxer says bringing back a trillion dollars &#8220;that&#8217;s sitting overseas&#8221; will &#8220;create jobs, strengthen the economy, and reduce the deficit.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Not likely.  If a company already has plenty of money to invest and can borrow against its foreign cash extraordinarily cheaply and sees an opportunity to expand its business by investing, it will invest.  You don&#8217;t need the tax holiday to do it. </p>
<p>Boxer, by the way, is bound to be under pressure from her Silicon Valley constituency- all those big IT companies that find it easiest to &#8220;transfer&#8221; their intellectual property to foreigners and then avoid US taxes, and who have great stores of funds overseas that would benefit from the repatriation tax holiday.</p>

                                <p>Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/10/is-lm-watch-in-the-country-of-the-one-eyed-the-self-blinded-man-is-in-bad-shape-department.html">has a spat with Scott Sumner</a>:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>The IS-LM model led economic historians to argue money was easy in 1929-30, because rates fell sharply. It led modern Keynesians to assume that money was easy in 2008, because rates fell sharply&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, I would say that not just &#8220;modern Keynesians&#8221; but a lot of people believed that monetary policy was expansionary in 2008.</p>
<p>They believed so not just because (safe) nominal (and real) interest rates were falling, but because the money supply was expanding. Indeed, since 2007 the Federal Reserve has tripled the monetary base</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But there remains a reason I suggest that cutting off Tim Geithner&#8217;s (and/or Ben Bernanke&#8217;s) private parts, stuffing them into his mouth, and perp-walking him publicly down Dewy Square* would be a good re-election move for the Obama Administration, and it comes back to basic economics. Specifically, Brad DeLong&#8217;s favorite monetary equation</p>
<p>
<blockquote>MV = PY</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, most of the time, we derive V—Velocity. We kinda sorta hafta. The velocity of money is not something that you really observe directly; to solve the equation for V(i), we have to know Y, P, and M.</p>
<p>But then we&#8217;re making assumptions about them. Two of them are probably reasonable:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Y = GDP (or GNP if you add in XM, but let&#8217;s not). We shorthand this as &#8220;aggregate output.&#8221; Even if we weren&#8217;t pretending it&#8217;s constant in the short-term, we can fairly well define this and hold to the definition. GDP=GDP, as it were.</p>
<p>P = Price Level. This is slightly more difficult conceptually, because we aren&#8217;t going to include everything. But if we assume (short-term) that the &#8220;market basket&#8221; is constant (or at least fungible**), we can come up with a representative index level and just treat this as &#8220;inflation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The third, however, is more problematic:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>M is the Base Money Supply, <em>which is circulating</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recall that V = Velocity, or, the number of times in a year that a dollar is spent, a definition that led to Keynes&#8217;s observation that V isn&#8217;t so much a constant (pace Fisher) as dependent on interest rates—V(i). This doesn&#8217;t (or, more accurately, shouldn&#8217;t) change much in the short-term, even at the zero-bound.</p>
<p>But &#8220;velocity&#8221; assumes money is circulating, which why it is multiplied by the Monetary Base from the start. If the monetary base has all the mobility of an overBotoxed actor&#8217;s face, we&#8217;re going to have a problem. I would call the following graphic &#8220;Where&#8217;s the Real Increase in the Monetary Base?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uYr4lzQEQBg/TpDpoHlYIII/AAAAAAAAAmA/cUkphxKcFTI/s1600/BASE%2Band%2BEXCRESNS.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uYr4lzQEQBg/TpDpoHlYIII/AAAAAAAAAmA/cUkphxKcFTI/s320/BASE%2Band%2BEXCRESNS.PNG"></a></p>
<p>The above graphic is Ben Bernanke&#8217;s fault. And even Brad DeLong knows this. The proof below the fold.</p>
<p>Or, at least, he strongly suggests he does, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/10/david-wessel-on-what-the-fed-might-do-and-i-think-ought-to-have-already-done.html">citing WSJ columnist David Wessel</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed is not out of ammo, the economists at the Bank Credit Analyst insist&#8230;</p>
<p>The three:</p>
<blockquote><p>Target a higher inflation rate or pre-specified level for the consumer price index or nominal gross domestic product. Problem: &#8220;could undermine the Fed’s long-standing commitment to price stability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stimulate bank lending by putting a tax on excess reserves, hoping that banks will the lend out the money if the have to pay borrowers to take the loans. Problem: &#8220;could lead to the collapse of money market funds and the disintermediation of the financial system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buy corporate debt, equities, real estate or foreign currency. Problem: Could require an act of Congress. &#8220;Given that the U.S. economy remains stuck in a liquidity trap,&#8221; Berezin concludes, &#8220;fiscal policy would be the most straightforward way to stimulate….However, the likelihood that the U.S. will receive major fiscal stimulus anytime soon is close to zero.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sanguine about the latter. Even absent economic issues (which are minimal in the current environment), the political ones are problematic.*** That it makes more sense than telling people to put their money into a 401(k) that consists 90% of company stock is a low bar to jump. On the other hand, buying Yuan until it has to appreciate is worth exploring.</p>
<p>The first has been getting traction for years. And I admit I can&#8217;t decide who was stupider: the people who set a 2% target on no evidence (sorry, <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2010/02/do-we-need-to-rethink-macroeconomic-policy.html">David</a>, I held to this even after reading <a href="http://www.imf.org/External/Pubs/FT/staffp/2001/01a/pdf/khan.pdf">your</a> <a href="http://imf.org/external/Pubs/FT/staffp/1998/12-98/pdf/ghosh.pdf">cites</a>) or the people who decided a &#8220;2% target&#8221; meant &#8220;<=." It now has enough traction that it will get out of the avalanche about the time the snow melts. So that leaves the second one. Which brings us back to the Monetary Equation problem. Recall that the definition of Velocity is "the number of times in a year that a dollar is spent." I buy something at the Dollar Store, they use that dollar to buy more products and pay employees, the suppliers and employees buy more supplies and other products, respectively, etc.**** So Brad DeLong ("I see no risks in attempting any of these three--and great risks in continuing to dither") agrees with Peter Berezin of Bank Credit Analyst (and me) that we don't want banks holding Excess Reserves as a matter of monetary policy at the zero bound. Fundamental principle of economics: you want to tax things you wish to discourage. You want to subsidize things you wish to encourage. As the Rabbi once said, "All else is commentary." So what did the Federal Reserve do <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081006a.htm">in the face of a desperate attempt from the Fed to stimulate the Base Money Supply</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p>The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 originally authorized the Federal Reserve to begin paying interest on balances held by or on behalf of depository institutions beginning October 1, 2011. The recently enacted Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 accelerated the effective date to October 1, 2008.</p>
<p>Employing the accelerated authority, the Board has approved a rule to amend its Regulation D (Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions) to direct the Federal Reserve Banks to pay interest on required reserve balances (that is, balances held to satisfy depository institutions&#8217; reserve requirements) and on excess balances (balances held in excess of required reserve balances and clearing balances).</p></blockquote>
<p>this lead to something that will surprise no economist of any caliber, let alone a Professor at Princeton:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RMKFhaA4Ksw/TpEA1b5vxGI/AAAAAAAAAmQ/lxm-s5XYjIc/s1600/image003.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RMKFhaA4Ksw/TpEA1b5vxGI/AAAAAAAAAmQ/lxm-s5XYjIc/s320/image003.jpg"></a></p>
<p>By the time of the stimulus, roughly that amount had been taken out of circulation as the change in Excess Reserves. Even if every cent had been well-allocated, it was already out of circulation.</p>
<p>Ben Bernanke giveth, but Ben Bernanke taketh away even more, in spades.</p>
<p>What Monetary Stimulus?</p>
<p>*Again, I don&#8217;t encourage this action. But if you think I can&#8217;t create or find a suggestion for each of the Occupy locations, you haven&#8217;t read and seen enough Jacobean drama.</p>
<p>**Whether we replace my wife&#8217;s three-year old mobile with either a &#8220;free&#8221; Droid or a &#8220;free&#8221; iPhone 3GS probably doesn&#8217;t have a significant effect. Economists pretend that the &#8220;steak-chicken&#8221; model is similar.</p>
<p>***Short version: You think the tempest-in-a-teapot that is Solyndra is getting discussion? Try that times ten when three or four REITs and a few companies go under. (Amazingly, those who complain about the &#8220;low&#8221; return on Government securities also loudly complain when the Government invests in non-risk-free securities.)</p>
<p>****It is left as a side-note that increasing the Velocity of Money is yet another way to reduce tax rates, all else equal. It is also left as a side-note that people who talk about &#8220;double taxation&#8221; of (voluntarily disbursed) dividends are economic ignoramuses, and that there are many economists who talk in that manner in no way invalidates the first half of this sentence.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care Thoughts: Institute of Medicine recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The Institute of Medicine (IOM) an influential organization long known for criticizing health care providers and advocating reform, has issued process recommendations for deciding the &#8220;essentials&#8221; of health insurance plans. An essentials list is required by DHHS by 2014 for all health plans available on the state health exchanges. The essentials should balance quality of care with projected premium costs.</p>
<p>PPACA does specify ten (10) broad areas of coverage, but not a specific plan menu.</p>
<p>The IOM study was a disappointment to some because it did not specify benefits, as this would have been a good discussion starter and would have given DHHS some political cover. The IOM focused on an approach to making the decision, and it is to start with costs and then work into benefits.</p>
<p>IOM also suggested an annual review of the programs beginning in 2016, and some waiver flexibility for states to customize plans.</p>
<p>Not exciting, but very very important.</p>

                                <p><strong>OccupyWallSt. should &#8220;have demands&#8221; and &#8220;be on the lawn of the Whitehouse&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/10/on-occupywallstreet-and-the-danger-of-elite-capture.html">Yves Smith</a> at Naked Capitalism describes misgivings for policy prescriptions (demands) becoming central to the OccupyWallSt. movement at this time.  Co-option of the energy and emotion of people taking the time to be involved is a real danger and cautions not to cave to media demands to suit convenient reporting or the apparent need for ready &#8216;expertise&#8217; in spokemen positions. <br />
<blockquote>I’m the first to admit I don’t have a good solution, but being aware of dangers increases the odds of navigating them successfully. Frankly I’ve been disconcerted at the calls for OccupyWallStreet to put forth demands. I’ve been party to extended e-mail exchanges among media types where a query regarding how OWS should deal with the demand that they put forth demands quickly devolved into most of the recipients trying to put forth proposals, rather than answer the question that was put to them. So I may be unduly sensitive to this issue.<br /><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />Krugman and fellow economists like Stiglitz, as well as other members of Obama’s initial finance team who favored aggressive financial services industry reform like Paul Volcker, may finally be in a position to exert real influence. But for every one of them, there are at least 50 members of the hackocracy. I think OWS is best served on building on its current momentum, getting more followers and extending its reach, since the dangers of elite capture are serious. There is nothing more that the orthodoxy would like to do than neuter the aims of OWS via inside the Beltway dealings and negotiation of hard to understand legislative fine print.</p></blockquote>

<p>Others have insisted the focus be on the Whitehouse (not Congress??). At some point of course.  But we can&#8217;t ignore the actual sources of policy prescriptions currently offered by either party.  </p>
<p>Lawrence Lessig in his new book <em>Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress &#8212; and a Plan to Stop It</em> (reviewed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/national-affairs/lawrence-lessig-on-how-money-corrupts-congress-and-how-to-stop-it-20111005">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-03/to-rescue-politics-adopt-small-donor-reforms-lawrence-lessig.html">here</a>.) describes a culture for our representatives in Congress that demands 30% to 70% of their time, and national party organizations that demand significant money from each Congressman over and beyond their own re-election needs.  </p>
<p>Given the pressure to make decisions based on the need for large sums, Lessig suggests that policy does not dominate:</p>
<p>1. While elected officials are dependent now on donors who command large amounts of money, they also play the partisan game of who gets the money by concentrating on issues that will bring in the most money from industries that spend on their own issues (he uses bank swipe fees versus unemployment issues as an example. Guess who won the lion&#8217;s share of the time spent.)  He tells us this is deliberate and planned.</p>
<p>2. The end result is a loss for either right or left so to speak&#8230;better financial regulation, addressing the broad array of employment, trade, a smaller and perhaps less intrusive government, a reasonable look at taxes&#8230;these are really less important than the carrot/stick routines described in the media as party issues or policy debates.</p>
<p>So where to start when you are the little guy?</p>

<p><strong>More on Occupy Wall Street&#8211;Stiglitz and Madrick add their voices</strong>
<p>Jim Swan, the Not-an-economist blogger who writes about &#8220;economics and the economy in the wake of the financial crisis&#8221;, is definitely a supporter of the Occupy Wall Street protest movement.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/10/friday-animations-occupy-wall-street-oct-6-young-activitists-and-labor-join-forces.html">earlier post</a>, I noted the addition of labor concerns to the voices supporting the movement&#8211;important, because so much of the impact of financialization of the economy has been to create a two-tiered social structure of privileged banker/investor/managers versus marginalized worker. Decades-long actions have undermined unionization&#8211;by limiting secondary strikes, by empowering employers to dominate workplace discussions, by weakly enforcing labor laws, by disempowering workers from forming unions, and now by the right&#8217;s efforts in the states to gut collective bargaining by public workers, in the process using a divisive technique of pitting private workers whose efforts to unionize have been hardest hit by the weakening of labor protections against public workers whose unions have given them more ability to claim decent wages. As a result, the vast majority of Americans find themselves with declining standards of living as wages stagnate or decline, while heads of big business rake in a bigger and bigger share no matter how the company actually fares, resulting in ridiculous golden parachutes for failed executives.</p>

<p>Notaneconomist notes the importance of progressive economic thinkers paying attention to the Occupy Wall Street group: see <a href="http://notaneconomist.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/occupy-wall-street-it%E2%80%99s-about-time-2/#more-515">Occupy Wall Street? It&#8217;s About Time!</a>, providing video and transcript links covering progressive economist Joe Stiglitz and economic historian Jeff Madrick addressing the group October 2. Part of the post follows.</p>
<p>Two excerpts from the Wall Street event (October 2):</p>
<p><strong>Stiglitz:</strong> Our financial markets have an important role to play. They’re supposed to allocate capital and manage risk, but they’ve misallocated capital and created risk. We are bearing the cost of their misdeeds. There’s a system where we’ve socialized losses and privatized gains. That’s not capitalism! That’s not a market economy. That’s a distorted economy, and if we continue with that, we won’t succeed in growing, and we won’t succeed in creating a just society….</p>
<p><strong>Madrick:</strong> The FBI actually told the powers that be that there was an epidemic of fraud in 2004 in the mortgage market. Washington and the Federal Reserve had the power to do something about that. They did not. The more bad mortgages went on, the predatory lending got worse, and the powers that be—in particular and let me name names, Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve—was able to retire in glory. Is there something with this picture? There sure is…</p>
<p>My only question is why the demonstrations didn’t happen sooner. Perhaps it has taken this long for it all to sink in. Not only did Wall Street recklessness create the crisis as government regulators looked on, but now bankers are back playing the same game and complaining of government interference, with no acknowledgment of the bailout that pulled them back from the brink.</p>
<p>Speaking of the bankers lack of acknowledgement of the bailout, Swan goes to <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/415/crybabies?act=1">NPR&#8217;s interview </a>a year ago with Wall Street bar patrons (an investment banker, an institutional investor, a credit rating agency quant). That&#8217;s definitely worth<a href="http://notaneconomist.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/occupy-wall-street-it%E2%80%99s-about-time-2/#more-515"> reading in full at NotanEconomist</a> (linked again in case you want to), but here&#8217;s the key part. After the interviewer suggests that the interviewees should acknowledge that all three benefited from the massive government intervention to protect the financial system, one of them says that the reason he still had a job was &#8220;because I&#8217;m a smart person&#8221;, not because Wall Street was bailed out. They view the fact that the industry was bailed out as irrelevant to their situation&#8211;they just used their smarts to take advantage of the situation and land well-situated.</p>
