<p>Inspired by the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/11/swarms-collective-intelligence-of.html">theory of the profit swarm written by Stormy</a>, and the words engraved in human history by the Presidents in their <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/11/state-of-union.html">final State of Union addresses</a> as provided by Cactus, I (OldVet) while not revealing whether I’m a godlike being or more like a chubby fallen Icarus who flew too close to the sun, bring this wisdom to you today:</p>
<p>I love financial markets and making a bit of profit.  However I learn (a) in whole or in part, that FASB 157’s mark-to-market disclosure rule may be delayed, that (b) the US Treasury is sponsoring a bank “special investment vehicle” or SIV investment fund, and (c) the (likely) downgrading of bond rating insurer companies. </p>
<p>If the insurers of bonds can’t raise money, they can’t insure bond values.  If SIV’s are allowed to flog off their collateralized but unmarketable debts to a US Government sponsored fund, they can’t be valued by the market place or put on the Balance Sheets of banks where they belong.  If accounting rules are relaxed to allow less disclosure of critical information, rather than tightened to provide more, it will be harder to trust what companies say about their financial condition.  Taken together, we highflying types are starting to wonder at just how much investors are being treated poorly. </p>
<p>Talk now swirls that Wachovia’s executives were in league with a firm whose top people hid money after taking a huge loan from a syndicate and then defaulted on the loan, per CNBC reporting on a law suit against Wachovia.  What is going on here?  Didn’t we learn anything from Enron (“special purpose vehicles” to hide assets/liabilities off the books) and Worldcom and Tyco with their diversions of millions to insiders?  As to the support from the US government and the Fed, through massive short term lending and rate cuts and sponsorship of breaks for speculators on Wall Street. &#8211; who are we then to shake our finger at China for its opaque financial practicies?</p>
<p>And a bit more information:</p>
<p>FASB organization has 30 pages of handouts about the partial deferral of new disclosure standards <a href="http://www.fasb.org/board_handou...ts/11-14-%2007.pdf">here</a>.  What won’t be covered by value disclosures are real estate, intangible assets and liabilities (e.g., patents, law suit outcomes, brand name assets.)  Looks like big banks are still on the hook to disclose how they value their mortgage backed loan portfolio investments.  However homebuilders like Lennar can “mothball” their unsold inventory without declaring losses in value.  At least some stocks will temporarily stay propped up!  The fact that organizations like Financial Executives International lobbied against implementing FASB 157 rules speaks volumes.</p>
<p>Which leads to question:  Should we drop everything and fly off to Wall Street to join in the pork fest, or hedge our bets down here on Earth?</p>

                                <p>Reader Empiricman sends a link to <a href="http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?ResearchID=782">this story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interestingly enough, this one change in statistical methodology has very different effects on the middle classes in different OECD countries.</p>
<p>While the United States saw a decrease in average income of 10 percent—the biggest decline of all 30 member states—the income of the British middle class rose by 32 percent. Similarly, France’s, Germany’s, and Japan’s average income increased by 28 percent, 20 percent, and 17 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>A small consolation for US middle-class workers would be that the incomes of its nearby Canadian brethren also declined by 5 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The result of all this is that today, the richest middle class in the OECD is found in Britain. In 2006, an average single British middle-class worker earning the average wage, net of taxes, and in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, had an income nearly 50 percent higher than his US counterpart—$35,000 compared to $25,000.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, US middle-class workers found themselves outside the top 10 in the OECD. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>And it doesn’t even help to marry. A British middle-class family with two children and two incomes of 100 percent and 67 percent of average wages still earns over 40 percent more (in PPP terms, net of taxes) than their US counterparts ($65,000 compared to $45,500). In fact, US families in this category rank only 15th in the OECD.</p>
<p>It may well be outside the realm of sanity to an American visiting London that a small lunch salad at Wimbledon is £8—or more than $16. But the truth is that it is probably not outside the purchasing power of the middle classes—or at least not the British one. </p></blockquote>
<p>Empiricman notes this is an adjustment to PPP.  The OECD site is moving like molasses right now, so I can&#8217;t find the original report.  I imagine that the drop in the value of the dollar must affect PPP.  After all, some things that are bought have to come from abroad.</p>

<blockquote><p>In the genteel world of bridge, disputes are usually handled quietly and rarely involve issues of national policy. But in a fight reminiscent of the brouhaha over an anti-Bush statement by Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks in 2003, a team of women who represented the United States at the world bridge championships in Shanghai last month is facing sanctions, including a yearlong ban from competition, for a spur-of-the-moment protest.</p>
<p>At issue is a crudely lettered sign, scribbled on the back of a menu, that was held up at an awards dinner and read, “We did not vote for Bush.”</p>
<p>By e-mail, angry bridge players have accused the women of “treason” and “sedition.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t a free-speech issue,” said Jan Martel, president of the United States Bridge Federation, the nonprofit group that selects teams for international tournaments. “There isn’t any question that private organizations can control the speech of people who represent them.”</p>
<p>Not so, said Danny Kleinman, a professional bridge player, teacher and columnist. “If the U.S.B.F. wants to impose conditions of membership that involve curtailment of free speech, then it cannot claim to represent our country in international competition,” he said by e-mail.</p>
<p>Ms. Martel said the action by the team, which had won the Venice Cup, the women’s title, at the Shanghai event, could cost the federation corporate sponsors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Treason and sedition?  If someone had held up a sign saying &#8220;Wedid not vote for Carter&#8221; in 1979, or &#8220;We did not vote for Clinton&#8221; in 1999, would anyone have accused that someone of treason or sedition?  Would anyone be talking about the loss of corporate sponsors?  </p>
<p>Heck, I lived in the South in the late 1990s &#8211; I can&#8217;t tell you how many people had bumper stickers that said &#8220;My President is Charlton Heston&#8221; on their cars.  Was that treasonous or seditious?  Is anyone hunting them down?</p>

                                <p>This post excerpts pieces of the final State of Union Address given by Clinton, LBJ, and Reagan.  </p>
<p>The first few paragraphs of <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton%27s_Eighth_State_of_the_Union_Address">Clinton&#8217;s  eighth and final State of the Union Address</a> read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow Americans:</p>
<p>We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history. Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis and so few external threats. Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity &#8212; and, therefore, such a profound obligation &#8212; to build the more perfect union of our founders&#8217; dreams.</p>
<p>We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs; the fastest economic growth in more than 30 years; the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years; the lowest poverty rates in 20 years; the lowest African American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record; the first back-to-back budget surpluses in 42 years. And next month, America will achieve the longest period of economic growth in our entire history.</p>
<p>We have built a new economy.</p>
<p>And our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the American spirit: crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years; teen births down seven years in a row; adoptions up by 30 percent; welfare rolls cut in half to their lowest levels in 30 years.</p>
<p>My fellow Americans, the state of our union is the strongest it has ever been.</p>
<p>As always, the real credit belongs to the American people. My gratitude also goes to those of you in this chamber who have worked with us to put progress over partisanship.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, it was not so clear to most Americans there would be much to celebrate in the year 2000. Then our nation was gripped by economic distress, social decline, political gridlock. The title of a best-selling book asked: &#8220;America: What Went Wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the best traditions of our nation, Americans determined to set things right. We restored the vital center, replacing outmoded ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a community of all Americans. We reinvented government, transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas that stress both opportunity and responsibility, and give our people the tools they need to solve their own problems.</p>
<p>With the smallest federal work force in 40 years, we turned record deficits into record surpluses, and doubled our investment in education. We cut crime, with 100,000 community police and the Brady law, which has kept guns out of the hands of half a million criminals.</p>
<p>We ended welfare as we knew it &#8212; requiring work while protecting health care and nutrition for children, and investing more in child care, transportation, and housing to help their parents go to work. We&#8217;ve helped parents to succeed at home and at work, with family leave, which 20 millions Americans have now used to care for a newborn child or a sick loved one. We&#8217;ve engaged 150,000 young Americans in citizen service through AmeriCorps, while helping them earn money for college.</p>
<p>In 1992, we just had a road map; today, we have results.</p>
<p>But even more important, America again has the confidence to dream big dreams. But we must not let this confidence drift into complacency. For we, all of us, will be judged by the dreams and deeds we pass on to our children. And on that score, we will be held to a high standard, indeed, because our chance to do good is so great.</p>
<p>My fellow Americans, we have crossed the bridge we built to the 21st century. Now, we must shape a 21st century American revolution &#8212; of opportunity, responsibility and community. We must be now, as we were in the beginning, a new nation.</p>
<p>At the dawn of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt said, &#8220;the one characteristic more essential than any other is foresight&#8230;it should be the growing nation with a future that takes the long look ahead.&#8221; So, tonight, let us take our long look ahead &#8212; and set great goals for our nation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t agree with all of the policies mentioned in this excerpt, most of this is stuff any President would love to be able to say.  </p>
<p>Here is a bit from <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lyndon_Baines_Johnson%27s_Sixth_State_of_the_Union_Address">LBJ&#8217;s last State of the Union address</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our gross national product has grown more in the last 5 years than any other period in our Nation&#8217;s history. Our wages have been the highest. Our profits have been the best. This prosperity has enabled millions to escape the poverty that they would have otherwise had the last few years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan%27s_Seventh_State_of_the_Union_Speech">Reagan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, we will have our differences. But let us always remember &#8212; what unites us far outweighs whatever divides us. Those who sent us here to serve them &#8212; the millions of Americans watching and listening tonight &#8212; expect this of us. Let&#8217;s prove to them and to ourselves that democracy works even in an election year.</p>
<p>We have done this before. And as we have worked together to bring down spending, tax rates, and inflation, employment has climbed to record heights; America has created more jobs and better, higher-paying jobs; family income has risen for four straight years, and America&#8217;s poor climbed out of poverty at the fastest rate in more than 10 years. (Applause.) Our record is not just the longest peacetime expansion in history, but an economic and social revolution of hope, based on work, incentives, growth and opportunity; a revolution of compassion that led to private sector initiatives and a 77 percent increase in charitable giving; a revolution that &#8212; at a critical moment in world history &#8212; reclaimed and restored the American dream.</p>
<p>In international relations, too, there&#8217;s only one description for what, together, we have achieved &#8212; a complete turnabout, a revolution. Seven years ago, America was weak and freedom everywhere was under siege. Today America is strong and democracy is everywhere on the move. From Central America to East Asia, ideas like free markets and democratic reforms and human rights are taking hold. We&#8217;ve replaced &#8220;Blame America&#8221; with &#8220;Look up to America.&#8221; (Applause.) We&#8217;ve rebuilt our defenses, and, of all our accomplishments, none can give us more satisfaction than knowing that our young people are again proud to wear our country&#8217;s uniform. (Applause.) And in a few moments, I&#8217;m going to talk about three development &#8212; arms reduction, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the global democratic revolution &#8212; that, when taken together, offer a chance none of us would have dared imagine seven years ago, a chance to rid the world of the two great nightmares of the postwar era. I speak of the startling hope of giving our children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror.</p>
<p>Tonight, then, we&#8217;re strong, prosperous, at peace, and we are free. This is the state of our Union. And if we will work together this year, I believe we can give a future President and a future Congress the chance to make that prosperity, that peace, that freedom, not just the state of our Union, but the state of our world.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a few months, GW will be giving his final State of the Union address.  What will he be able to say with a straight face?  What is the State of the Union?  Do you have big dreams?  Do you feel strong, prosperous, at peace, or free?</p>

                                <p>An interesting <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/13/science/13traff.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print">article</a> concerning swarms appeared in the NYT last Tuesday. Dr. Ian Couzin, a mathematical biologist, offered intriguing explanations of how various swarms actually occur. What all swarms have in common is that their behavior is nothing more than the summation of every individual’s behavior.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the principle guiding the behavior of each individual is the same guiding principle for every other individual in the swarm. That principle or rule can be reduced to a very simple mathematical description. The behavior of each individual is efficient, simple, direct, unthinking, efficient, and immediate.</p>
<p>Different rules and triggering mechanisms apply to different beasties, but the overall effect is simple and geometric. From the outside, there may seem to be intelligence at work; but that is illusory. Seen from the inside, watching any one of the parts, we immediately see the blindness of it all. Although each actor acts with ruthless efficiency, efficiency is not intelligence. Nor is the swarming behavior necessarily in the best interest of the swarm.</p>
<p>The march of the cannibalistic Mormon crickets I found especially intriguing: Keep moving or you will be eaten.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mormom crickets will gather by the millions and crawl in bands stretching more than five miles long. Dr. Couzin and his colleagues…found that the forces behind cricket swarms are very different from the ones that bring locusts together…When Mormon crickets cannot find enough salt and protein, they become cannibals.&#8221;Each cricket itself is a perfectly balanced source of protein,&#8221; Dr. Couzin said. &#8220;So the crickets, every 17 seconds or so, try to attack the other individuals. If you don’t move, you’re likely to be eaten.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The reason all this interests me is that it is applicable to collective human activity. People swarm, politically, socially, religiously, and, of course, economically.</p>
<p>Some of you may remember Movie Guy’s hydrologic theory of economics: Just as water flows to the lowest spot of ground, so to does unrestrained and unguided economic activity always race to the bottom, seeking the cheapest labor, the least taxation, the fewest regulations.</p>
<p>A &#8220;swarm&#8221; theory of economics would be analogous to Movie Guy’s theory—and might actually &#8220;sit well&#8221; with many economists. Instead of gravity—which is metaphoric&#8211;, we might posit something like the following: Each individual seeks the most profit from the least amount of effort. Remind you of those graphs economists like to draw? Unrestrained economic activity is efficient—always mathematical.</p>
<p>Profit is simply the difference between expense and income. Each individual measures the effort required to receive a desired amount of income. Some are happy with little; others climb the corporate ladder. Different parts of the swarm &#8220;swirl&#8221; or move differently, but all parts are driven by a simple and similar principle: Self-interest.</p>
<p>Seen from the outside, we can see the resultant patterns, the inevitable results.<br />Consider, for a moment, the problem of energy. For the last half century, the U.S. has repeatedly failed to recast its energy policy.</p>
<p>Or, to put to the matter another way, why did impoverished Iceland make the effort while the U.S. did not? (Iceland is now almost, if not completely, energy self-sufficient—and quite wealthy as a result.)</p>
<p>In terms of swarm theory, Iceland is not more intelligent or more far-sighted than the U.S. Iceland had no alternative but to move in a different direction. It commanded no armies; it had nothing of substance to trade. It moved towards geothermal because it was the only path available. Immediate necessity drives each unit of the swarm.</p>
<p>In short, there is a kind of exorable path that will be taken, regardless on any one individual’s intelligence. Why has the U.S. failed to have a sane energy policy? The answer is simple: There was never an immediate need. Each individual in a swarm responds only to its immediate environment. To move en mass to alternate sources of energy—however wise in the long run—violates the principle of immediate response, violates the principle of immediate self-interest, a violation that would force the individual or unit to act with foresight, something he instinctively will not do. Trying to change the principles of a particular swarm is like trying to push water uphill.</p>
<p>Consider again economic activity in general. It really is no different. Economic activity collects and organizes itself around the cheapest source of profit. To claim anything else is smoke and mirrors. Individuals swarm within corporations—seeking quick and easy profit. Corporations themselves swarm—globally. Each corporation will seek a monopoly. Each corporation will seek the cheapest labor, the lowest taxation, and the fewest regulations, regardless of whether that activity is good for the world or not. Right now, China is the honey pot of the world.</p>
<p>Free marketers love the swarm. In its immediate, unthinking efficiency they see intelligence. Let the market do its business, sans regulations, sans interference. Globalization is nothing more than a world-devouring swarm; each individual or company is acting only in immediate self-interest. All of the excuses for how we are globalizing are merely excuses for allowing each individual or corporation to operate as simply, as mindlessly, and as ruthlessly as possible.</p>
<p>Governments exist to provide wisdom and guidance, to set rules for behavior, to modify swarm behavior. What happens when the principles of the swarm invade and control the government, when the government cannot in any way guide the swarm? Is that not precisely what is happening, both here in the &#8220;democratic West&#8221; and in communist China? Consequently, we have no energy policy&#8230;and China has no environmental policy. With no controls in place, our credit crunch is becoming disastrous.</p>
<p>Remember, that kind of behavior got us into trouble with energy. Swarms have no intelligence. Swarms are efficient in what they do and how they behave. Immediate efficiency is not always a sign of intelligence or wisdom. Blind are the rules of nature; blind still are the rules of physics; blinder still are those who celebrate the swarm as the right model for human activity. How does a swarming species such as us refrain from taking the path that will make its own environment uninhabitable? What kind of intelligence will keep the swarm from being smothered in its own pile of shit?</p>

<blockquote><p>A $1.2bn (£590m) contract for training Iraqi police was so badly managed that auditors do not know how the money was spent, the US state department says.<br />The programme was run by a private US company, DynCorp. It insists there has been no intentional fraud.<br />Auditors have stopped trying to audit the programme because all the documents are in disarray and the government is trying to retrieve some of the money.<br />Training Iraqis to take over security is a key part of US strategy.<br />&#8230;<br />Stuart Bowen Jr, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR), blamed the problems on long-standing contract administration problems within the state department office that awarded the contract.<br />He said &#8220;lack of controls&#8221; and &#8220;serious contract management issues&#8221; within the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) made it &#8220;vulnerable to waste and fraud&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p><a title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7074285.stm" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7074285.stm">Another BBC</a> article states:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>An independent panel has strongly criticised the way the US army manages contracts to supply its troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />The panel said there were high levels of fraud and waste in relation to contracts worth $4bn (£1.9bn) a year.<br />It blamed a lack of oversight and said only about half the army&#8217;s contracting staff were properly qualified.<br />Defence Secretary Robert Gates said he was &#8220;dismayed&#8221; by the report and the Pentagon would pursue its suggestions.<br />The army says it is pursuing 83 criminal inquiries related to contract fraud and more than $15m in bribes have been exposed.<br />The panel did not address specific allegations against individuals, but made clear that a lack of oversight and too few army contracting personnel had exacerbated systemic problems.</p>
<p>The number of army personnel responsible for managing contracts in Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan dropped as the number of contracts and their value soared over 12 years, the panel found.<br />Only about half of all contracting personnel are certified to do their jobs, it added.<br />The panel said some 2,000 extra staff were needed to deal with a 600% increase in the workload.<br />&#8220;This is a systemic issue within the army and within the DoD [Department of Defense],&#8221; said Jacques Gansler, chairman of the commission.<br />Senator Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said it could take the state department up to five years to review invoices and demand repayment from DynCorp for unjustified expenses.<br />&#8220;This scenario is far too frequent across the federal government,&#8221; he said.<br />DynCorp had been asked to improve its management of government-owned equipment in Iraq twice before.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are many sides to the issue. One is a government that can account for expenditures in a sane way with a reasonable margin of error, which at present is not in place. This is being simply responsible and efficient in my mind. The other is prosecution for fraud, which is another matter and ex post facto, and harder than even being more efficient.</p>
<p>Since it appears to be bi-partisan issue overall in Congress to simply continue the process, why is it framed as partisan? It would seem to me either you are for gross wastefulness or not. And to reduce oversight while increasing spending seems counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>So do we just live with it? Is the margin of error in wastefullness the political issue here? Or is the concern marginal as only a concern for Ron Paul ? Is it unpatriotic to waste tax money and fail to deliver a service so grotesquely but vital to national security? Maybe not criminal, but severely undermining our security is unpatriotic.</p>
<p>What did Cheney mean by &#8220;deficits don&#8217;t matter&#8221;?  Can a market believe in patriotism?  Or a CEO within the confines of his/her company policies?</p>

<blockquote><p>Veterans today have only the Montgomery G.I. Bill, which requires a service member to pay $100 a month for the first year of his or her enlistment in order to receive a flat payment for college that averages $800 a month. This was a reasonable enlistment incentive for peacetime service, but it is an insufficient reward for wartime service today. It is hardly enough to allow a veteran to attend many community colleges.</p>
<p>It would cover only about 13 percent of the cost of attending Columbia, 42 percent at the University of Hawaii, 14 percent at Washington and Lee, 26 percent at U.C.L.A. and 11 percent at Harvard Law School.<br />&#8230;</p>
<p>MEMBERS of Congress and other political leaders often say that the men and women who have served in our military since 9/11 are the “new greatest generation.” Well, here’s a thought from two infantry combat veterans of the Vietnam era’s “wounded generation”: if you truly believe that our Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are like those who fought in World War II, let us provide them with the same G.I. Bill that was given to the veterans of that war.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are we funding private contractors to provide increased income for soldiers? How many of the soldiers are US citizens? Blackwater raided the Chilean army for several hundreds of soldiers&#8230;do we have figures? Is there any connection?</p>
<p>Is an education bill a more productive use of funds for us, leaving aside immediate concerns for a second?</p>

                                <p>Kevin Drum has a post on <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_11/012502.php">on the State of Indiana&#8217;s voter ID laws</a>, which are the strictest voter ID laws in the country:</p>
<blockquote><p>By a substantial margin, the Indiana residents most likely to possess photo ID turn out to be whites, the middle aged, and high-income voters. And while this is undoubtedly just a wild coincidence, these are also the three groups most like to vote for Republicans.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>Overall, 91% of registered Republicans had photo IDs compared to only 83% of registered Democrats.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think regular readers will be surprised if I note that I&#8217;m not a Republican.  But I have no problems at all with requiring valid ID before allowing people to vote.  I&#8217;d like to know that the people voting have the right to vote, and are voting precisely as many times as they have that right.</p>
<p>Am I missing something here?</p>
