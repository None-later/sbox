<div>The chief justice, echoing Justice Scalia&#8217;s &#8220;broccoli&#8221; comment at the oral argument, rejected (as did the four dissenters, and so that is now the view of a majority of the justices) the Commerce Clause ground for the mandate, saying that to accept that ground would mean that &#8220;Congress could address the diet problem by ordering everyone to buy vegetables.&#8221; This argument, reassuring though it is to our obese population, confuses separate constitutional provisions. The Commerce Clause would empower Congress to order everyone to buy vegetables, because the market for most vegetables is interstate, but the &#8220;liberty&#8221; protected against the federal government by the Fifth Amendment would doubtless be interpreted to forbid such an imposition, just as it would be interpreted to forbid a federal law requiring everyone to be in bed with the lights out by 10 p.m. in order to economize on the use of electricity and, by doing so, reduce carbon emissions from electrical generating plants.

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’m with the others.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I think that as a practical matter, this will have almost no limiting effect at all on Congress’s regulatory powers.  I can’t think of any circumstance in which this limitation would apply and in which there would be no other enumerated power under which Congress could enact the law.  In this case, the other enumerated power is the taxing power.  In the case of, say, the Selective Service Act, the enumerated power is the power to provide for the national defense.  Etc.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The reason that this limitation is insignificant is that the Commerce Clause argument was really a disguised Fifth Amendment due process (liberty! broccoli!) argument, and Roberts flatly rejected that.  He said, no, the Commerce power doesn’t allow this but the taxing power does—and, no, it doesn’t violate fundamental constitutional concepts of freedom, of liberty!  There may be other things that could be compelled under the taxing power—broccoli purchases, maybe—that would violate Fifth Amendment due process concepts (freedom! liberty!) and thus be unconstitutional on that basis, just as there are things that could be compelled under the Commerce power that would violate that concept of due process and thus be unconstitutional on that basis.  But this does not violate that concept of due process (freedom! liberty!). 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>No, Roberts didn’t specifically separate the two concepts—Commerce Clause limitations and Fifth Amendment due process—and, yes, he does almost seem to conflate them the language Scocca quotes.  But the bottom line is that he found no due process (freedom! liberty!) problem with the mandate and penalty, and therefore no slippery slope to broccoli in this instance, even though he says the Commerce power isn’t broad enough to authorize the statute.  
</p>

                                <p>
<div>I think there was a clue to Roberts’ thinking during the first day of argument—during the argument on the applicability of the Anti-Injunction Act, an obscure “jurisdictional” statute, which precludes courts from ruling on the constitutionality of a federal tax until after the statute becomes effective and the tax actually is due.  Roberts really indicated during that argument that he was interested in finding a way to rule that the penalty was a tax for purposes of Congress’s taxing power but not a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.  That would remove the issue of whether the mandate was within Congress’s Commerce power, since if it is a tax, the mandate and penalty/tax are within Congress’s taxing power.  And then the only issue would be whether this violated the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause (liberty! broccoli!).
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Late in the argument on the mandate issue the next day, under questioning by Sotomayor, the challengers’ lawyer, Paul Clement, conceded that under its taxing power, Congress could do pretty much the same thing as it did under what Congress thought its Commerce power allowed it to do.  That effectively killed the due process (liberty! broccoli!) argument, since for purposes of that argument, it made no difference which Congress’s powers authorized it to enact the mandate and the related penalty.

<div>While the Court’s upholding the mandate is deservedly taking front stage in the media coverage, the Court’s decision to strike down a part of the Medicaid expansion may ultimately have broader jurisdprudential consequence.  That, at least, will be a subject of debate among lawyers and academics in the days and weeks to come.  This is the first time (as far as I know) that the Court has actually found a Spending Clause condition unconstitutionally coercive.  Whether it establishes principles that make many other programs vulnerable is a question that will require further analysis and debate.  Lyle Dennisten will start that analysis in an post later today or tomorrow morning.

<div>I one of the many updates to my initial post this morning, mentioned this exchange between Lyle Denniston and Tom Goldstein (SCOTUSblog’s publisher:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Lyle: The rejection of the Commerce Clause and Nec. and Proper Clause should be understood as a major blow to Congress&#8217;s authority to pass social welfare laws. Using the tax code &#8212; especially in the current political environment &#8212; to promote social welfare is going to be a very chancy proposition.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Tom: I dissent from Lyle&#8217;s view that the Commerce Clause ruling is a major blow to social welfare legislation. I think that piece of the decision will be read pretty narrowly.
</p>
</div>

<div> I wrote:

<div>I’m almost always in agreement with Lyle’s analyses (as is, I’m sure, Tom Goldstein, who is the blog’s publisher and also a major Supreme Court litigator; Amy Howe, also a lawyer, is Goldstein’s wife).  But, like Goldstein, I disagree with Lyle on this one.  In order for the Court to interpret this opinion as limiting Congress’s authority to enact social welfare legislation, the Court would have to place in question a slew of current, longstanding social welfare programs.  I don’t think that was Roberts’ intent—really, I don’t—and I don’t think the opinion will be viewed that way.  Unless, of course, Romney wins and appoints a wingnut to replace, say, Ginsburg if her health does not hold out.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<div>Here’s what I think will happen: </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>But first, I need to point out that Medicaid, unlike Social Security and Medicare, are programs structured as partnerships between the respective states and the federal government, each paying some portion of the cost, and that Medicaid has always contained a provision that makes state participation voluntary and that allows states to remove themselves from the program if they want to.  Social Security and Medicare, by contrast, are solely federally-funded and federally-run programs. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The 26 states that challenged the ACA’s Medicaid provision argued that a provision in the Medicaid section of the ACA allows the federal government to withdraw all federal funds for a state’s entire Medicaid program—that is, the money it already is receiving—if a state opts out of the Medicaid-expansion part of the ACA.  The states argued that this was too coercive and therefore violates principles of state sovereignty.  Seven justices—the four dissenters, Roberts, Breyer and Kagan—agreed with that claim, and so they ruled that, while the federal government can put conditions on its funding of the new expansion, and can withdraw the money for that expansion if a state doesn’t comply with the conditions, the federal government <i>can’t</i>withdraw funding also for the earlier parts of Medicaid that the state already was receiving.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sooo …. this ruling certainly (in my opinion) appears to have no effect whatsoever on any program funded entirely through, and administered by, the federal government.  And i tappears to have no effect on any social welfare program that is a partnership between states and the federal government as long as there is no threat by the federal government to withdraw funds already being given to the state for something else, in order to get the state to agree to participate in the new partnership, or in the new part of the part of the partnership.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I just don’t see how this restricts in any significant way Congress’s ability to enact social welfare programs.  I think that ruling is really very narrow.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As an aside, I want to mention the four dissents who wanted to strike down the entire ACA tried to at least persuade Roberts that the entire Medicaid-expansion part of the statute simply because that one provision in that part of the Act was ruled unconstitutional—even though, as Roberts points out, the Act includes what’s known as a “severability” provision providing that if any particular section of the Act is ruled unconstitutional, the section should be severed from the remainder of the statute, and the remainder should remain in force.  This let’s-see-if-we-can-get-the-tail-to-wag-the-dog-and-win-on-this-part-at-least tack of the minority was so transparently inappropriate that Roberts, in responding to it in his opinion, seems downright offended by it.  Good for him.

                                <p>No not the striking down of the mandate part, heck probably a thousand fingers were poised over an equal number of &#8216;Send&#8217; keys when the ruling came down. Me? I took a shower and started thinking about the practical implications of ACA as it will operate under current law as modified today.</p>
<p>Starting with the MLR. Which you did hear about here first in this AB post from July 2009<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/hr3200-sec-116-golden-bullet-or-smoking.html"> HR3200 Sec 116: Golden Bullet or Smoking Gun</a> . MLR stands for Medical Loss Ratio which in the final version of ACA was set at 85% for the Group market and 80% for the Individual market for health insurance policies issued by private insurers. Now &#8216;Medical Loss&#8217; is itself an interesting term of art, it represents the actual amount of insurance premiums collected &#8216;lost&#8217; via being expended on actual care paid for under your policy. That is for insurance companies the actual end service being delivered from purchase of their product is from their perspective a dead loss to be reduced. Hence a business model built around denying claims.</p>
<p>MLR minimums start to flip that model on its head. Under the rule if the ratio of premium collected to provider payments issued exceeds 15% or 20% respectively in Group or Individual market the difference has to be rebated to the policy holder. And indeed such rebate checks actually went out this year, this provision having already kicked in. Well after this morning&#8217;s ruling that rule will continue to operate until specifically repealed. And it is important, though maybe not as much as I was able to convince Donny Shaw of when he put this post up on Open Congress on Nov 14, 2009 <strong><a href="http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/1357-The-Most-Important-Health-Care-Reform-Provision-You-ve-Never-Heard-Of">The Most Important Health Care Reform Provision You&#8217;ve Never Heard Of</a>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>For example Richard Escow of HuffPo and elsewhere is of the opinion (expressed semi-privately to me and some others), that while important MLR can be gamed. </strong><strong>And in fact I discuss that somewhat in my original 2009 post, feel free to rip on this in comments. Me? I still</strong><strong> think MLR is transformational.</strong><br /><strong></strong><br /><a name="more"></a><strong><br /></strong><br />So what things are NOT included as &#8216;medical losses&#8217;? In short: administration, management, and direct profits from operations. (For example gains from retained and reinvested profits would not I think count against the company). Currently a lot of health insurance administration is focused on making sure that people likely to submit claims don&#8217;t get signed up and/or denying claims to those who for whatever reason obtain coverage. Well various separate &#8216;must cover&#8217; &#8216;no pre-existing condition exclusion&#8217; rules take care of much of the first part, under ACA the companies have little room to just turn customers away. And MLR installs limits on the second part. While companies have an incentive to trim their medical &#8216;losses&#8217; as close to the minimum as possible, every dollar spent doing so puts a squeeze on the same 15% or 20% of premiums they need to pay management salaries and return profits to shareholders. While every dollar squeezed out of the claims process by increasing efficiency and throughput of claims (i.e. actually paying providers on a timely basis with a minimum of paperwork requirements) leaves that much left over for management and shareholders. Gosh all of a sudden we have a business model based on efficient DELIVERY of services rather than DENIAL of them.</p>
<p>Paging Rusty Rustbelt! And Mike Halasy! Because I would love to see how this argument plays to people from the provider community. Particularly folk who have been on both sides of the overall issue. And of course I welcome comment from everyone else. I have been largely absent from the Health Care Debate since actually passage of ACA, the ball went into the lawyers&#8217; court and I am if anything less a lawyer than I am an economist. But after this morning we are right back in the policy analysis game. To which I say &#8220;Put me in coach!&#8221;</p>

                                <p>UPDATE: From SCOTUSblog: &#8220;The bottom line: the entire ACA is upheld, with the exception that the federal government&#8217;s power to terminate states&#8217; Medicaid funds is narrowly read.&#8221;</p>
<p>TOTAL, TOTAL VICTORY   !!!!
<div></div>
<div>SECOND UPDATE: The opinion is 5-4, with Roberts voting with the Dem appointees and writing the opinion, and Kennedy writing the main dissent.
</p>
</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>Here’s more from SCOTUSblog:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The money quote from the section on the mandate: Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the exaction in Section 5000A under the taxing power, and that Section 5000A need not be read to do more than impose a tax. This is sufficient to sustain it.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The court reinforces that individuals can simply refuse to pay the tax and not comply with the mandate.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering funds under the ACA to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that states accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use. What Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.&#8221; (p. 55)</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>And (added after second update was posted):
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Another way to think about Medicaid: the Constitution requires that states have a choice about whether to participate in the expansion of eligibility; if they decide not to, they can continue to receive funds for the rest of the program.</div>
<p>The most talked-about part surely will be “individuals can simply refuse to pay the tax and not comply with the mandate” part.  Is it really a mandate at all if there’s no penalty for refusal to comply?  So maybe it&#8217;s not a total victory, after all.  But it&#8217;s still a big, big victory.  
</p>
<p>(The Medicaid part of the ruling has no effect on the breadth or implementation of the law at all.)</p>
<div>THIRD UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Correction from SCOTUSblog (and HT to buffpilot in the comment to my post):
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apologies &#8211; you can&#8217;t refuse to pay the tax; typo. The only effect of not complying with the mandate is that you pay the tax.  </p>
<p>Looks like everything revolves on it being a tax.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ah-hah!! It IS a TOTAL, TOTAL victory.  !!!</p>
<div>FOURTH UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Again from SCOTUSblog:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In Plain English: The Affordable Care Act, including its individual mandate that virtually all Americans buy health insurance, is constitutional. There were not five votes to uphold it on the ground that Congress could use its power to regulate commerce between the states to require everyone to buy health insurance. However, five Justices agreed that the penalty that someone must pay if he refuses to buy insurance is a kind of tax that Congress can impose using its taxing power. That is all that matters. Because the mandate survives, the Court did not need to decide what other parts of the statute were constitutional, except for a provision that required states to comply with new eligibility requirements for Medicaid or risk losing their funding. On that question, the Court held that the provision is constitutional as long as states would only lose new funds if they didn&#8217;t comply with the new requirements, rather than all of their funding.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>Yup. Total, total victory.  </p>
</p>
<p>
<div>FIFTH UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>From SCOTUSblog:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Court holds that the mandate violates the Commerce Clause, but that doesn&#8217;t matter b/c there are five votes for the mandate to be constitutional under the taxing power.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, kudos, to … um … me.  I called it pretty nearly spot-on.  I began to sort of wonder in the last few days whether in fact I really was onto something, because my post from June 15 laying that out (again) kept getting more and more “hits” as the days went by.  Usually my posts stop getting “hits” a few days after I post them.  I actually began (almost) thinking it was possible that a few people from within the Court itself—i.e., law clerks to the justices—were clicking the post after possibly being told of it by someone who reads, maybe, Business Insider.  If so, that would seem to indicate that I actually had called it right.  But I dared not <i>really</i> think that Supreme Court law clerks were reading my post.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Btw, in a comment to a blog conversation on Slate on Monday, I wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hmm.  Well, having gone out on a limb 10 days ago on a blog I write for, posting an article that discusses as one of the more likely possible healthcare-case results the tax-law outcome that Savage suggests in his LA Times article today, I’m feeling ever-so-slightly less lonely out on that tree branch.  At least now I’ll have someone to cling to on Thursday as the limb falls to the ground. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The blog conversation is ongoing there.  The current latest entry (from last night) is <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2012/_supreme_court_year_in_review/supreme_court_year_in_review_who_lost_obamacare_the_leading_suspects_are_the_solicitor_general_the_white_house_liberal_law_professors_and_five_supreme_court_justices_.html">here</a>, should any AB readers be interested. </div>
</div>
<div>SIXTH UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div>Salvaging the idea that Congress did have the power to try to expand health care to virtually all Americans, the Supreme Court on Monday upheld the constitutionality of the crucial – and most controversial — feature of the Affordable Care Act.   By a vote of 5-4, however, the Court did not sustain it as a command for Americans to buy insurance, but as a tax if they don’t.  That is the way Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., was willing to vote for it, and his view prevailed.  The other Justices split 4-4, with four wanting to uphold it as a mandate, and four opposed to it in any form.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Since President Obama signed the new law, it has been understood by almost everyone that the expansion of health care coverage to tens of millions of Americans without it could work — economically — only if the health insurance companies were guaranteed a large pool of customers.   The mandate to buy health insurance by 2014 was the method Congress chose to supply that pool.   It is not immediately clear whether the Court’s approach will produce as large a pool of new customers.   The ACA’s key provision now amounts to an invitation to buy insurance, rather than an order to do so, with a not-very-big tax penalty for going without.
</p>
</div>

<div>&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/for-scotusblog-one-goal-beat-everybody-and-break-news-of-health-care-ruling/2012/06/27/gJQA1TZp7V_story.html">Lyle Denniston</a>, “<a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/06/dont-call-it-a-mandate-its-a-tax/">Don’t call it a mandate — it’s a tax</a>,” SCOTUSblog
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Those are the first two paragraphs of Lyle’s (I love him, and can refer to him by his first name if I want to) three-paragraph initial article on the regular blog (as opposed to the live blog).  He’s sure to post updates to the article later today.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Earlier, on the live blog, Amy Howe wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Take a quick look at Footnote 11, which is on page 44 of the slip opinion: Those subject to the individual mandate may lawfully forgo health insurance and pay higher taxes, or buy health insurance and pay lower taxes. The only thing that they may not lawfully do is not buy health insurance and not pay the resulting tax.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And for those of you who remember my writing about an obscure court-jurisdiction statute called the Anti-Injunction Act, which was a subject of controversy in the case, Lyle, writing earlier on the live blog, wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Interesting, at least to scholars, that while the mandate and its attached penalty are a tax for purposes of its constitutionality, but not for the Anti-Injunction Act. If it were a tax for AIA purposes, this case would not have been decided re the mandate.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also on the live blog, Lyle wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The rejection of the Commerce Clause and Nec. and Proper Clause should be understood as a major blow to Congress&#8217;s authority to pass social welfare laws. Using the tax code &#8212; especially in the current political environment &#8212; to promote social welfare is going to be a very chancy proposition.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Tom Goldstein then wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I dissent from Lyle&#8217;s view that the Commerce Clause ruling is a major blow to social welfare legislation. I think that piece of the decision will be read pretty narrowly.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’m almost always in agreement with Lyle’s analyses (as is, I’m sure, Tom Goldstein, who is the blog’s publisher and also a major Supreme Court litigator; Amy Howe, also a lawyer, is Goldstein’s wife).  But, like Goldstein, I disagree with Lyle on this one.  In order for the Court to interpret this opinion as limiting Congress’s authority to enact social welfare legislation, the Court would have to place in question a slew of current, longstanding social welfare programs.  I don’t think that was Roberts’ intent—really, I don’t—and I don’t think the opinion will be viewed that way.  Unless, of course, Romney wins and appoints a wingnut to replace, say, Ginsburg if her health does not hold out.  
</p>
</div>
<div>SEVENTH (Yikes!) UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>This one’s not from SCOTUSblog.  It’s from Ginsburg’s concurrence, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>At bottom, THE  CHIEF  JUSTICE’s and the joint dissenters’ “view that an individual cannot be subject to Commerce Clause regulation absent voluntary, affirmative acts that enter him or her into, or affect, the interstate market expresses a concern for individual liberty that [is] more redolent of Due Process Clause arguments.”  SevenSky, 661 F. 3d, at 19.  See also  Troxel v.  Granville, 530 U. S. 57, 65 (2000) (plurality opinion) (“The [Due Process] Clause also includes a substantive component that provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Plaintiffs have abandoned any argument pinned to substantive due process, however, see 648 F. 3d 1235, 1291, n. 93 (CA11 2011), and now concede that the provisions here at issue do not offend the Due Process Clause.8
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Footnote 8 says:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>8. Some adherents to the joint dissent have questioned the existence of substantive due process rights.  See McDonald v.  Chicago, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 7) (The notion that the Due Process Clause “could define the substance of th[e] righ[t to liberty] strains credulity.”); Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 275 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“I reject the proposition that the Due Process Clause guarantees certain (unspecified) liberties[.]”).  Given these Justices’ reluctance to interpret the Due Process Clause as guaranteeing liberty interests, their willingness to plant such protections in the Commerce Clause is striking.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The <i>SevenSky</i> opinion, <i>SevenSky v. Holder</i>, that Ginsburg quotes from was written last November by Lawrence Silberman, a Reagan appointee to the federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and one of the most respected (in conservative legal circles) federal appellate judges, in one of the ACA cases. As for Ginsburg’s footnote 8, she says something I’ve wondered about all along: Substantive due process is legal doctrine under which <i>Roe v. Wade</i>and, before that, the opinion striking down  a Connecticut law that prohibited the sale and use of contraceptives, were based.  <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i>, the 2003 Kennedy opinion invalidating Texas’s sodomy statute also was based on that doctrine.  Thomas and Scalia routinely lambaste the doctrine, as do many other tea partier folks. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So the question is: Do these people now concede the appropriateness of the legal doctrine underlying those cases they hate so much?
</p>
</div>

                                <p>Lifted from the comments from an Ezra Klein article in the  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/study-long-term-deficits-are-linked-to-24-percent-lower-growth/2012/06/17/gJQAtYlLjV_blog.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> comes an interesting idea that is not only currently debated, but also ties into &#8216;markets are &#8220;natural&#8221; idea&#8217;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Paul Andrews comments:<br />Yes &#8211; lots of saving and borrowing, often in goods rather than money. When money is included its often only a fiat monetary base exchanged by the government for goods, with no banking sector and therefore no deposits created by lending, no M1, M2, M3. No shadow banking sector etc. </p>
<p>Refer to this <a href="http://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap65.pdf" target="_blank">BIS summary on fiscal dominance from December 2011</a></p>
<blockquote><p>A quote: &#8220;Starting with financial intermediation, recall that banks play no role whatsoever in macroeconomic models of the pre-crisis era. These traditional models are based on the distinction between nominal and real quantities, and there are interest rates. But the only friction is the one associated with nominal price changes, so inflation and inflation control become the focus. (If it is costly to change prices, inflation creates a deadweight loss.) And, since the model is devoid of banks, there is no private debt. As I suggested at the beginning, the macroeconomic models of the future, with their added focus on financial linkages, need to have a rationale for debt as distinct from equity. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote>We need to understand why the predominant financial contract is a loan or a bond rather than equity. In fact, we need a clear understanding of the optimal debt/equity ratio for the economy as a whole. We know that high levels of debt can lead to disaster for a society, but beyond notions from crude empirical work, we don’t have any idea what the right level of debt is. A rich enough macro/monetary/financial model will tell us the answer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>…there are four questions before it. Three of those questions revolve around the “minimum coverage” provision, popularly known as the “individual mandate.” </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>…But before the Court can decide whether the mandate is constitutional, it must first decide whether it can even rule on this question at all. </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>…all that anyone will really be interested in with regard to the AIA is the Court’s bottom line: can it review the mandate issue or not? If it agrees with both sides that it can, all eyes will then turn to that constitutional question. Most Americans care about the bottom line: is the mandate constitutional? Even if the Justices disagree on the reasoning, the mandate would still survive.</p>
<p>Finally, as long as the Court doesn’t conclude that the entire ACA must fall, it will have to resolve one more issue: does another provision of the Act violate the Constitution because it effectively coerces the states, requiring them to comply with the ACA’s expanded Medicaid eligibility requirements or risk losing all of the money that they receive for Medicaid from the federal government?</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve just begun to browse the pages of David Graeber&#8217;s  2011 book entitled &#8216;Debt &#8211; The First 5,000 Years&#8217;.  Graeber is an anthropologist who makes no bones about the historical errors made by many economists on the evolution of markets and the use and nature of money.<br />   <br />On pages 44-45 Graeber writes:    <br />&#8220;People continue to argue about whether an unfettered free market really will produced the results that [Adam] Smith said it would; <i>but no one questions whether &#8220;the market&#8221; naturally exists</i>&#8230;.we simply assume that when valuable objects do change hands, it will normally be because two individuals have both decided they would gain a material advantage by swapping them.  One interesting corollary is that, as a result, economists have come to see the very question of the presence or absence of money as not especially important, since money is just a commodity, chosen to facilitate exchange, and which we use to measure the value of other commodities.  Otherwise it has no special qualities.<br />    <br />&#8220;&#8230;.Call this the final apotheosis of economics as common sense.  Money is unimportant.  Economies &#8211; &#8220;real economies&#8221; &#8211; are really vast barter systems.  <i>The problem is that history shows that without money, such vast barter systems do not occur</i>&#8230;.It&#8217;s money that had made it possible for us to imagine ourselves in the way economists encourage us to do:  as a collection of individuals and nations whose main business is swapping things.  It&#8217;s also clear that the mere existence of money, in itself, is not enough to allow us to see the world this way. &#8230;<br />    <br />&#8220;The missing element is in fact&#8230;the role of government policy&#8230;&#8221;<br />  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Graeber goes on to explain how government foster &#8216;the market&#8217;.  Laws, police, monetary policy, pegging the value of currency to precious metals, altering the amount of coins in circulation, regulating banks etc.    <br />On page 49 Graeber asks a key question: &#8220;&#8230;what exactly was the point of extracting the gold, stamping one&#8217;s picture on it, causing it to circulate among one&#8217;s subjects &#8211; and then demanding that those same subjects give it back again?&#8221;<br />    <br />&#8220;This does seem a bit of a puzzle.  But <i>if money and markets do not emerge spontaneously</i>, it actually makes perfect sense.  Because this is the simplest and most efficient way to bring markets into being.&#8221;    <br />Money brings markets into being.  Not the other way around, as most economists would have it.  If this is true then Graeber&#8217;s concluding thought has some authenticity:  &#8220;<i>Perhaps the world really does owe you a living</i>.&#8221;</p>
