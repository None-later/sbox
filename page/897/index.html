                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>It has become a rare day that the smart and honest conservative known as <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDFmNzI2MjcxOThjMzk5MjU2MjkzNjljOGI0MDFhY2E=">Bruce Bartlett</a> agrees to write something for the National Review.  Some of this is informative:<br />
<blockquote>According to the Internal Revenue Service, in 2001 the gross tax gap was $345 billion, which fell to $290 billion following enforcement efforts. This suggests that about 14 percent of all taxes that are owed annually are not paid &#8211; a figure that is no higher today than it was in the 1980s. These numbers are primarily for individual income and payroll taxes; the IRS has not updated its research on corporate-tax compliance for decades. One reason for this is that the line between tax evasion and legal tax avoidance in the corporate sector is very, very murky. For many corporations, it’s not worth the bother to evade taxes when there are so many legal tax-avoidance opportunities available.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope Bruce is not counting the abuse of non-arm’s length pricing as being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Perfectly-Legal-Campaign-Benefit-Everybody/dp/1591840198">Perfectly Legal</a> and consistent with section 482.  Such abuses are where the real money lies and it is shame that the IRS goes after the pennies from the working poor while allowing multinationals the right to shift profits to places like Switzerland.  </p>
<p>Bruce continues:<br />
<blockquote>In practice, the IRS has to concentrate its resources on areas where there is the greatest potential revenue yield, which may not be where the greatest amount of evasion exists.  For example, a high percentage of alimony income goes unreported, but the total amount of alimony paid is so small that the aggregate dollar amount of evasion is tiny. The same is true of unreported state tax refunds and unemployment compensation. Indeed, the relatively high level of non-reporting from these income sources may be due largely to taxpayer ignorance that such income is in fact taxable. The point here is that closing the tax gap in ways that will yield significant revenue to the government is much harder than generally believed. Most people think the IRS just needs to audit more people. But unless it has good reason in advance to believe that fairly substantial revenues will result from an audit, the practice could easily be counterproductive. The increased deterrent effect could be more than offset by taxpayer complaints that will result in efforts by Congress to tie the IRS’s hands and cut its budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>But if the IRS does not enforce the tax code, there would be no deterrence.  So the bean counting of how much we could collect understates the value of enforcement.  But I agree with Bruce’s “concentrate its resources on areas where there is the greatest potential revenue yield”.  Might I suggest that the IRS should follow this advice in terms of enforcing the transfer pricing rules?  <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/02/14/ap3428247.html">Linda Johnson</a> of Forbes gives us one example:<br />
<blockquote>Merck &#038; Co., mired in multibillion litigation over its withdrawn painkiller Vioxx, has eliminated another legal headache, resolving several tax disputes with the Internal Revenue Service by agreeing to a $2.3 billion settlement &#8230; Tax and accounting analyst Robert Willens of Lehman Brothers said in such cases drugmakers generally sell medicines at low cost to subsidiaries in countries with lower tax rates, which can then mark up the price and keep more profit after taxes.  &#8220;This is a constant tug-of-war between the IRS&#8221; and companies, Willens said. He said Merck paid a very high percentage of the amount of taxes in dispute &#8211; about 60 percent &#8211; far higher than the one-third or so that is typical. &#8220;That would suggest Merck must have felt it had a fairly weak case,&#8221; Willens said.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the Glaxo litigation, the IRS argued that the drug importer overcharged its U.S. subsidiary.  In a recent settlement, the government collected $3.4 billion. This precisely why we should be listening to folks like David Cay Johnston.  And yes I realize that had Bruce said that, Rich Lowry and Jonah Goldberg would not have allowed him to publish his piece at the National Review.  But isn’t that why Bruce should be allowed alternative places to publish his thinking?</p>

                                <p>Pardon me for peeking over at the National Review again, but the latest from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MjgwOWEzMTUwMzc4N2U3MmFhZTdlMmJlNTQ3Nzk0NzQ=">Thomas Sowell</a> is just too funny:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you take the mainstream media seriously, you might think that every important scientist believes that “global warming” poses a great threat, and that we need to make drastic changes in the way we live, in order to avoid catastrophes to the environment, to various species, and to ourselves &#8230; The very attempt to silence all who disagree about global warming ought to raise red flags. Anyone who remembers the 1970s should remember the Club of Rome report that was supposed to be the last word on economic growth grinding to a halt, “overpopulation” and a rapidly approaching era of mass starvation in the 1980s. In reality, the 1980s saw increased economic growth around the world and, far from mass starvation, an increase in obesity and agricultural surpluses in many countries. But much of the media went for the Club of Rome report and hyped the hysteria.  Many in the media resent any suggestion that they are either shilling for an ideological agenda or hyping whatever will sell newspapers or get higher ratings on TV. Here is their chance to check out some heavyweight scientists specializing in weather and climate, instead of taking Al Gore’s movie or the pronouncements of government bureaucrats and politicians as the last word.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not quite sure what he’s talking about with respect to his (false) premise that we all believed the predictions of the Club of Rome report.  And I certainly have no idea why he claims that we are trying to silence the few heretics who doubt global warming as our government still honors the First Amendment (as long as one is not criticizing George Bush’s Iraq policies).  But hey – you find Ph.D.s in economics who try to deny the law of scarcity – including this <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZjY4MWIzODlmZjg3NmMxOTU4OTRkYzFlYmIzNTM3NWE=">National Review nitwit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for the idea that making the tax-rate cuts permanent will be bad for the economy, the critics rely on an additional piece of information: the budget deficit. Proponents of this doomsday view believe that lower tax rates lead to persistent deficits which in turn “crowd-out” private investment and in the long run result in higher interest rates and lower growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Victor Canto decides to invoke the name of William of Ockham was who lived from 1288 to 1348.  Maybe Ockham didn’t understand the basics of Solow’s growth theory given that his seminal paper was written in the late 1950’s.  But one would think a Ph.D. in 2007 would understand that reducing national savings lowers long-term growth.  </p>
<p>But there are heretics in every profession.  <em>Memo to Rich Lowry and Jonah Goldberg</em>: if you insist on publishing such incredibly stupid stuff, be careful not to put two things out on the same day that nullify each other so blatantly.</p>

<blockquote>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday rejected a Democratic lawmaker&#8217;s suggestion that he consider cutting interest rates to bolster the economy.  Bernanke, testifying for a second day on Capitol Hill, this time before the House Financial Services Committee, repeated that the Fed is likely to hold rates steady for a while if slower economic growth nudges inflation lower this year and next as expected.  But the Fed also thinks inflation is too high and might go higher, Bernanke said. If he and his colleagues adjust borrowing costs in coming months, they are more likely to raise rates than lower them. &#8220;In order for this expansion to continue in a sustainable way, inflation needs to be well controlled,&#8221; Bernanke said in response to remarks by committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.). &#8220;If inflation becomes higher for some reason, then the Federal Reserve would have to respond to that by raising interest rates.&#8221; Frank had told Bernanke the Fed&#8217;s stance was &#8220;troubling&#8221; to him because the central bank also forecasts the economy will grow at a moderate rate this year, below its long-term average, and that inflation will drift lower over time. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how we get a concern of inflation,&#8221; Frank told Bernanke. &#8220;Why is there not at least an equal chance for there to be a reduction&#8221; in interest rates? Bernanke responded that he and his Fed colleagues see several risks that the economy may not behave as forecast, and they would adjust interest rates as needed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chairman Ben is better at forecasting than this Angrybear and he certainly has his views on how close we might be to full employment.  But the following got <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/02/inflation_and_unemployment_ber.html#015529">Dean Baker</a> riled up:<br />
<blockquote>There is no specific level of unemployment that automatically triggers inflation, Bernanke, a former chairman of the Princeton University economics department, said in response to several lawmakers&#8217; questions. That contrasts with the traditional view of many economists that unemployment below about 5 percent is inflationary. Bernanke&#8217;s remarks partly reflect years of research that has debunked the idea of a long-term trade-off between unemployment and inflation. They also reflect the nation&#8217;s experience in the late 1990s, when unemployment fell as low as 3.9 percent without causing much inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean writes:<br />
<blockquote>The article implies that Bernanke&#8217;s position is based on a solid body of economic research: &#8220;Bernanke&#8217;s remarks partly reflect years of research that has debunked the idea of a long-term trade-off between unemployment and inflation.&#8221; Actually, Mr. Frank was not proposing that the Fed lower rates with the idea that there would be a long-term trade-off between inflation and unemployment, he was suggesting that the Fed could lower rates and thereby lower unemployment, with no clear impact on inflation. This is exactly the path that Alan Greenspan followed in the mid-90s when he allowed interest rates to stay low and the unemployment rate to continue to fall even though the unemployment rate was already below 6.0 percent, the generally accepted estimate for the NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) at the time. The Greenspan experiment refuted the prevailing economic views about the relationship between inflation and unemployment. At this point, there is no widely accepted body of research on this topic. It is inaccurate to imply to readers that Mr. Bernanke is relying on a large body of research in rejecting suggestions for a rate cut. He isn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s make this simple by first stating that Mr. Henderson’s reference to some alleged long-term Phillips curve trade-off was just stupid.  I think we’ve all moved past that canard.  From time to time, I have mused as to what the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/employment-over-past-six-years.html">Natural Rate of the Employment to Population Ratio</a> might be.   The current Employment to Population Ratio is 63.3% and my guess has been that the natural rate is closer to 64%.  Some of our conservative blogging economist friends have suggested it might be a little lower than my guess.  If Chairman Ben thinks the natural rate is closer to 63.5%, then fine.  But there is not a “large body of research” proving me right and him wrong nor visa versa.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>By now I’ve pissed off a lot of you.  Tuesday, I looked at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively.html">changes in real GDP per capita over Presidential administrations</a>, on Wednesday I took into account the national debt, thus looking at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_14.html">changes in real GDP less increases in debt per capita over Presidential administrations</a>.  Thursday I suggested some <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_15.html">reasons</a> why Republican Presidents might perform poorly relative to Democrats, especially when debt is taken into account.  </p>
<p>Several readers have suggested the results are nothing more than a coincidence.  One might note that I have titled this series somewhat facetiously; even if there is no reason for it other than coincidence, for some reason, we have had higher growth in real GDP less increases in real debt per capita when Democrats have been in office than when Republicans have been in office.  </p>
<p>But perhaps, as some readers suggested, the fault lies with Congress.  That can be checked.  </p>
<p>The growth rate in real (GDP less increases in debt) per capita when both chambers of Congress are Democrat, when both chambers are Republican, and when each chamber is controlled by a different party are as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdW7aYVHjjI/AAAAAAAAACU/AhdZdyOgXrk/s1600-h/God+Punishes,+part+4,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdW7aYVHjjI/AAAAAAAAACU/AhdZdyOgXrk/s320/God+Punishes,+part+4,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This would seem to indicate that the results observed by Presidency also apply to Congress…. growth rates of real GDP less real increases in the debt per capita are higher under Democratic Congresses than under Republican Congresses.</p>
<p>But… what about when we take the President into account?</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdW7TYVHjiI/AAAAAAAAACM/pN8xeaMIbCo/s1600-h/God+Punishes,+part+4,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdW7TYVHjiI/AAAAAAAAACM/pN8xeaMIbCo/s320/God+Punishes,+part+4,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>When the President has been a Democrat, growth has been higher when the Congress was also controlled by Democrats.  </p>
<p>When the President has been a Republican, growth has been lower when the Congress was also controlled by Republicans.  (A mixed congress actually works best under a Republican President – perhaps the split makes it more difficult to make a difficult with Congress to put forth the President’s growth destroying policies.)  </p>
<p>Now, these results were somewhat surprising to me.  I did not expect a Democratic Congress to perform better than a Republican Congress.  I haven’t checked, but I’m told that growth in GDP (nominal, not per capita) is faster under Republican Congresses than under Demcratic Congresses.  So what gives?  I suspect that despite their respective reputations, Democrats, whether in Congress or in the White House, are less likely to run up the debt.  (We’re looking at changes in real GDP less increases in the debt, after all.)  Tax and spend seems to be more constructive than don’t tax and don’t spend, especially when the “don’t spend” part drops out of the equation.</p>
<p>As an example…  consider the period under Clinton.  Growth rates in GDP were higher in the latter half of his term…  but the biggest cuts in the deficit (and hence the big slowdowns in the rate of increase in the debt) came early – before the Republican Revolution.  Thus, changes in what matters  &#8211; real (GDP less increases in the debt) per capita were actually slightly higher in the first two years of Clinton’s term than after.  Whatever the transmission mechanism, one of the important factors in the difference between Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans are more likely to leave a legacy of debt to the future.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, whether by coincidence, Act of God, luck, or better policies, growth rates have been higher under Democratic Presidents than under Republican Presidents, and growth rates have been higher under Democratic Congresses than under Republican Congresses.</p>

<p>Data</p>
<p>Debt came <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo4.htm">from from 1950 to 2005</a> can be obtained from the Treasury; this data set provides data from 1953 to 1985 for December 31st of each year, and for 1985 to 2005 for September 30th of each year.  Data for September 2006 was also obtained <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/NPGateway">from the Treasury</a>.   </p>
<p>Real GDP per capita came from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SS_Data/Section7All_xls.xls">BEA’s NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  However, to match the debt series, this time I used Q4 data through 1985, and Q3 data thereafter.</p>

                                <p>The House <a href="http://budget.house.gov/analyses/07CBO_baseline_report_1_24.pdf">Committee on the Budget</a> projects this to grow to $761 billion by 2017.  What is the non-social security deficit with additional items?  The additional items include the cost of extending the tax cuts and realistic defense spending projections.  While <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002862.html">Max Sawicky</a> objects, he notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Democrats say the &#8220;true size of the deficit&#8221; should include the Social Security Trust Fund surplus. This bumps up the $172 billion FY2007 deficit up to $362b.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, the Trust Fund surplus is counted as a revenue source for the government as Max notes.  I trust Max does not agree with rightwingers and this White House that this revenue should be devoted for extending tax cuts for the rich as opposed to funding the Social Security benefits through 2050 or so.  </p>
<p>While Max suspects there is more nonsense in this document, we should note that the Democrats have thoroughly rejected the Laugher Curve nonsense that reducing national savings is good for long-term growth.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: What this report does is similar in spirit to something <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/01/budget-forecasts.html">Kash</a> wrote and I tried to use to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/projected-federal-debt-to-gdp-ratio.html">extrapolate</a> where the total Federal debt to GDP ratio would be heading.  My attempt to do this suggested that we might hit a debt to GDP ratio near 75% by 2017 but as I read this report’s forecast, they are suggesting it will still be just shy of 70%.  So maybe the House Democrats are being optimists wit what “an effort to jump up the number and hype fiscal crisis”.  </p>
<p>To be fair – this forecast assumes we continue with Bush’s fiscal folly, which always promises things will get better only to find out things become worse then we could ever imagine.  Yes – only two more years to our nightmare.</p>

                                <p>This is one prediction I am not happy to see coming to pass.  The housing slump was today <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070215/ap_on_bi_ge/housing_slump;_ylt=ArE.VnH7brTUMq99JbJ_8gdI2ocA">reported</a> to have spread to most of the country, with 40 states seeing sales falling and price decreases in many urban areas.  It is somewhat ironic that this report comes out right at the moment the Fed Chief is <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/feb2007/pi20070215_025927.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_businessweek+exclusives">telling Congress</a>  that the economy is looking pretty good.  Maybe it is in the aggregate but it is hard not to see the housing slump as a harbinger of more to come as the air comes out of the housing bubble we have seen in many coastal urban areas.  As noted in various previous posts on this topic, the US economy will need to produce more traded goods (i.e. manufactures, among others) and less non-traded goods (i.e. houses) if it is to ever close the gap in its trade balance.  Indeed, if you are one who believes that foreigners will be willing to finance this gap for the rest of time then there is no need to worry.  For the rest of us, we will hope that this shift happens gradually and not all at once.  But it does seem that the shift is starting to happen.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTMxODhhYjQ5N2RhODZiYmRkY2M1ZmFmYjMzZmVhNTM=">Thomas Sowell</a> asks “What exactly does John Kerry think a think tank does?”  What was the context:</p>
<blockquote><p>AEI has planned a roundtable discussion of global warming, attended by people with differing views on the subject. That was their fundamental sin, in the eyes of the global-warming crowd. They treated this as an issue, rather than a dogma &#8230; These senators express “our very serious concerns” about reports that AEI “offered to pay scientists up to $10,000 for questioning the findings” of other scientists.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d have no problem if scientists were paid to offer up their opinion – regardless of which way it went.  So what was AEI expecting from those scientists who reviewed this “major climate change report”?  If they paid $10,000 to each scientist independent of what the scientist was going to say on this issue, I can see Sowell’s point.  In other words, would the AEI have paid $10,000 to a scientist who agree with the finding of the report?  If the payments were only offered to those who agreed with the rightwing global warming deniers, however, then this is academic prostitution.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2007_01_28-2007_02_03.shtml#1170541963">Jonathan Adler</a> gave the folks over an AEI to defend themselves and then concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>If there were evidence that AEI was trying to get individual scientists to change their tune in return for large honoraria, there would undoubtedly be a story here. But there is no evidence this occurred. The general views of Professors Schroeder and North are well knowm to those who work in this area, and were unlikely to be swayed by ths offer (and they were not). More broadly, just as there may be financial incentives to write analyses desired by corporate funders, there are also financial incentives to tailor research projects and findings to increase the likelihood of receiving government grants. This is why I believe scientific studies should be analyzed on their merits, not the source of funding. In the end, some may wish AEI was not sponsoring critical research and analysis of the IPCC report and current climate policy proposals, but it&#8217;s hardly a scandal that they do.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wasn’t saying that AEI bribed Steve Schroeder to change his views.  What I was saying was the AEI was only invited those who agreed with their position, such as Steve Schroeder, to present.  Now if they did pay for those scientists whose research suggests global warming is occurring and is due to human activity – I’ll apologize for this post.</p>

I have two objections to what Jane wrote here:<br />
<blockquote>I find it interesting to note that if you replaced &#8220;social security crisis&#8221; with &#8220;global warming&#8221;, you&#8217;d find that most liberals and conservatives had neatly switched positions. Why? Because addressing each crisis requires cutting into something that one side values; free enterprise, on the one hand, and the progressive structure of social security, on the other.  Easy for me to say, of course; I&#8217;m one of those rare cats who thinks that we should do something sooner rather than later about both global warming and social security, so it&#8217;s fun for me to sit on the sidelines with my &#8220;Tu Quoque!&#8221; sign. But I&#8217;m trying to make a serious point, which is that all of us look for ways to defer unpleasant decisions into the future; we differ only on which decisions strike us as unpleasant.  Deferral is not a good strategy for problems of these potential magnitudes. Time gets rid of some problems, but it makes others, like demographic crises and cumulative environmental damage, worse, and as most of us know from our own experience, ignoring problems in the hope that they&#8217;ll go away generally results in a full scale disaster rather than a manageable inconvenience.</p></blockquote>
<p>Arnold is posing the Social Security problem in terms of a lack of precautionary savings.  Jane suggests we liberals object to more savings, which cannot be true at least for this liberal.  My objection to the Bush tax cuts was precisely because it lowered national savings.  In his comments to my earlier post, Arnold appeared (to me at least) to change his position every time I tried to pin it down.  My Update II basically took his comment that the precautionary savings should come from stripping future benefits from the working poor so we don’t have to tax the “investor class”.  OK, now we are getting to my objection as this strikes me as a transfer of wealth from the working poor to the investor class.  That’s what liberals are objecting to – not a call for more savings.  </p>
<p>But my other objection to the analogy between the two long-run issues goes to the claim that money is fungible (perfect substitutes) to the realization that the global warming debate is over two goods that are not perfect substitutes: (a) a climate more favorable to general wellbeing and productivity; and (b) material goods (including productive machinery).  I trust Arnold Kling and Jane Galt understand that these two are not perfect substitutes.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Two days ago, I had a post looking at the growth rate in real GDP per capita by Presidential administration.  Yesterday, I looked at the grwoth rate in real GDP less change in debt per capita by Presidential administration.  I probably got more critical comments (and e-mail) about these two posts than about anything else I&#8217;ve written.  I thought it would be worth addressing some of those critiques in a post.  (Especially since I&#8217;ve been collecting data to do a follow-up.)</p>
<p>So to begin, I realize there was no analysis in these two posts and that I didn&#8217;t take into account any of the myriad of things that might have mattered.  I&#8217;ve had any number of posts on growth rates before in which I have tried to take into account lags and whatever other factors for which I could find data.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have more.  This post was inspired by something else.  Republican Presidents are generally supported by people who call themselves &#8220;pro-growth.&#8221;  Republicans tell us that their policies will lead to more growth.  Presumably, then, we would expect to see faster growth when Republicans are President.  </p>
<p>Alternatively, one might insist that there are lagged effects that only kick in after 8 years of a Republican administration.  That might conceivably explain JFK-LBJ, or Carter, but not why it took so much longer for Reagan’s policies to kick in (i.e., GHW&#8217;s term didn’t go so well, and it took a bit of time for Clinton to start putting up numbers on growth).</p>
<p>Anyway, without redoing all the previous posts I&#8217;ve had, let me speculate on why we see what we see: </p>
<p>1.  Republicans generally (claim to) prefer smaller government.  In effect, this means less social programs.  At the margins, at the levels of spending on those programs that we&#8217;ve observed, additional dollars in those areas produce more growth than additional dollars spent on areas the Republicans prefer.<br />2.  Republicans (other than Ike) seem to have been more willing to run large deficits.  PGL and I (not to say folks at other blogs) have had posts showing that greater growth is achieved with smaller deficits or even small surpluses.  <br />3.  There is an optimal tax rate for producing growth because there is an optimal size of government.  I&#8217;ve had posts showing that this optimal tax rate is probably higher than it was, say, when Reagan left office.<br />4.  Republicans may be less competent than Democrats.  Reagan clearly had no idea what was going on by the end of his term.  Considering several times early on he confused movies with reality, perhaps he was always out of it.  GW has clearly been over his head from day one.  <br />5.  Republicans may take government less seriously.  GW has famously been running up his time in Crawford.  Reagan famously did the same in California and Camp David.  Ike was known for his time in the golf course, and Nixon&#8217;s hobby apparently was criticizing Jews and trying get his enemies.  By contrast, LBJ was known as a consummate deal maker (whether you liked him or not), Carter was such a micromanager he kept track of who was using the tennis courts, and the Clinton administration was known for its late meetings that required pizza deliveries.  <br />6.  Republicans may be more tolerant of corruption and corruption creates its own problems.  I’ve had posts looking at tax enforcement and the funding of the Treasury and the IRS budget that get at this.  Similarly, consider recent scandals.  Clinton lied about sex.  GHW claimed not to be in the loop about a violation of the National Security Act.  Reagan claimed he didn’t remember when it came to sending a couple of planes loaded with missiles to Iran.  <br />7.  Those who vote Republican may be more interested in substance than delivery for whatever reason.  Long time readers might recall my post on <br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/abortions-and-unwed-mothers-by-numbers.html">abortions and unwed motherhood</a> showing such a phenomenon may not be limited to economic issues.<br />8.  Shear coincidence/God dislikes Republican Presidents and always throws obstacles in their path.</p>
<p>Anyway, so there… some speculation on why we observe what observe.  Maybe I&#8217;m wrong about all of it.  But&#8230; regular readers know that I will happily put up posts written by the readers.   This includes posts with which I disagree, provided they are well thought out.  (Regular readers no doubt can recall several examples of this.)  My spreadsheets are available to anyone.  In my posts, I have also provided links to the original data.  If you feel something is wrong with the two posts I wrote… write a better one, and I will put it up.  Show me that its something else.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/guilty_as_charg.html">Mark Thoma</a> and <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/02/social_security_31.html">Arnold Kling</a> are having an interesting debate as to whether we should think of the future of Social Security in terms of precautionary savings – with a hat tip to <a href="http://www.janegalt.net/blog/archives/005080.html">Jane Galt</a>.  This is all very interesting but Arnold really needs to explain this line:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason we should try to fix Social Security now is that the cure can be painless now. The problem is that under conservative assumptions about productivity, promised future benefits exceed future revenues by an ever-growing amount. So cut promised future benefits, and then if productivity does well, you can restore benefits if you like. The point is, planning for the worst case scenario does not hurt anybody in the non-worst-case scenario.</p></blockquote>
<p>I tend to get nervous when I here someone talking about painless solutions.  There are some conservatives who emphasize the benefits of savings without noting that to get more capital accumulation – we have to cut consumption today.  Arnold may protest that he is talking about cutting promised future benefits.  OK, but then we don’t get more savings if we decide to cut consumption in the future rather than today.  Or as Mark replies:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;m confused about something though. If you were to tell me that I will receive 1 million dollars on the day I turn 67 would that change my behavior today? Yes. I&#8217;m pretty sure it would. Would I feel better off today? Yes again. So, go in the other direction. If you tell me I will have less money in the future because my benefits will be cut, maybe not by a million dollars but by enough to matter, will that change my behavior today? Yes it will, and I’ll feel worse off. More importantly, is it reversible like Arnold says? Suppose I give up a vacation and save instead because I believe benefits will be cut in the future. I can&#8217;t always reverse that later (I can&#8217;t necessarily climb the same mountain or ski the same slopes when I&#8217;m older, and even if there&#8217;s no physical constraint, the opportunities will differ with time). Or maybe the benefit cuts make it so I can&#8217;t simultaneously send a child to college and save as much as I need to for retirement due to resource constraints. How does cutting future benefits, even probabilistically, leave me unaffected in such a case? The point is that changing expected future benefits alters the time paths for consumption and saving (a premise, or at least a hope, of those in favor of privatization of Social Security)  which, contrary to the claim above, does affect people &#8220;in the non-worst-case scenario.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Arnold – when you said painless, you seemed to suggest there is a free lunch.  I trust you realize there is no such thing.  I’m as confused as Mark is about this passage.  Please clarify.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Arnold and I have traded comments under this post.  It would seem his position is that households don’t save enough and there is some magic public policy change that will fix that.  And I thought I was the liberal!  OK Arnold – what is the market failure and how is a change in public policy going to fix that?</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: Arnold and I have traded comments again.  Arnold seems to be frustrated with me that I don’t get his argument so he tries again.  As I read his latest comment, dare I try to interpret it?  Well let’s see how far I get this time.  He is saying that if we take away people’s promised benefits, they will save more.  Well, this is exactly what Ando and Modigliani might say as well so Arnold must be correct.  So if we take away a person’s expected future income, which is akin to a reduction in lifetime income, then this person will decide to consume less today so they can save more for their retirement.  No quarrel here, but isn’t a reduction in wealth equivalent to pain for that person.  So I ask again – what did Arnold mean by “painless”.  Painless to who?  Yep – I suspected there was some distributional twist to all of this and it seems Arnold has confirmed as much.</p>
<p>Let me go further by suggesting Jane Galt and Arnold have mischaracterized the liberal objection to their proposal.  It’s not that we don’t want people to save more.  Heavens – the deficit hawk wing of my party – to which I’m a member – have hammered the free lunch fiscal fiasco of Bush’s income tax cuts as reducing national savings.  But we have also long suspected that this was part of a grand plan to transfer wealth from the working poor to the “investor class” as Kudlow would have it.  If Jane Galt and Arnold Kling want more precautionary savings, I agree.  The question is how do we get there?  Raise taxes on the rich or go for this backdoor employment tax increase that Arnold is advocating.  I prefer the former.</p>
