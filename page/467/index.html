                                                                    </div>

<p>If this article by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01health.html">REED ABELSON in the NY Times</a> is correct, health insurance companies are basically begging for the H Clinton health care plan.  Now I&#8217;m old enough to remember that things looked good in February 1993, but it seems that Obama&#8217;s opposition to a mandate was (accidental ?) genius.  The plan he proposed during the campaign is popular and would be so horrible for insurance companies that they are lobbying for universal coverage, that is, a mandate.  </p>
<p>Of course they don&#8217;t want to have to compete with medicare and everyone seems to expect that eliminating that will be part of the deal. I mean when it comes right down to it, people are willing to sacrifice efficiency and let the public debt grow.</p>
<p>Quotes and discussion after the jump</p>
<p>The article starts scary</p>
<blockquote><p>GO ahead, take a guess: Which company has developed a 2,000-page strategic plan and gathers its senior executives almost every other working day to talk about how well they are doing?</p>
<p>Not General Motors. Not Citigroup. Not A.I.G.</p>
<p>The answer is Aetna, the Hartford-based company that is one of the nation’s largest health insurers.</p></blockquote>
<p>But then it seems that Aetna is trying to develop a strategy to get to universal health care. </p>
<blockquote><p>But the industry is also taking a very public role in voicing concern about some of the proposals being floated. In supporting legislation that would prevent the companies from refusing to cover people with existing medical conditions, the insurers have said the government must require everyone to buy insurance, subsidizing the cost for those who cannot afford it.</p>
<p>FOR private insurers, the more troubling specter in health care reform is an expansion of the Medicare program to those under 65. The program has lower expenses and generally pays much less for medical care than private insurers, so it would probably translate into a lower-cost plan for consumers.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Now the article is a monster puff piece which could have been written by Ronald A. Williams, chief executive of Aetna.  Still the insurers are sticking to their line that they want a mandate, that they need a mandate, that they&#8217;ll behave if they are given a mandate.  </p>

<p>Tom is Dear Markets, just because I don&#8217;t have any money in stocks that I can&#8217;t afford to lose doesn&#8217;t mean I want to lose the money [*]. Kthxbai.</p>
<p>Friend 1: Laughing. With just the very slightest tinge of hysteria&#8230;</p>
<p>Tom: I comfort myself with the thought that the lost value of the kids&#8217; college fund would&#8230; pay for approximately one [Fancy Pants University] textbook in the early 2020s.</p>
<p>Friend 2: We will be back to a barter system by 2020. I believe a standard 3 credit course will cost 3 cans of Spam and two nine volt batteries.</p>
<p>Friend 3: (fingers in ears) lalalalalalala&#8230;</p>
<p>Tom: [Friend 2], that may not be the worst thing unless Jim Kunstler is right and the 2020 economy [**] consists of 3 cans of Spam and two 9V batteries.</p>
<p>Friend 1: God, has anyone seen this week&#8217;s issue of <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/">New Scientist</a>? Algal mats, solar power, and the apocalypse. I think I&#8217;ll join [Friend 3] with my fingers in my ears&#8230; [link added]</p>
<p>Friend 4: I only will say that I think it&#8217;s a very good thing your wife and I knit. That will be a valuable skill in the new economy.</p>
<p>Tom: [Friend 1], Should our high-ish latitude inland location prove valuable (i.e. should the Mississippi hold back the Great Plains Desert), the party will be at our house. Install the photovoltaics and pass the ammo!  [Friend 4], knitwear for the apocalypse! I like it! [***]</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In this corner, <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/this-makes-more-sense-or-does-it.html">as previously mentioned</a>, Yves Smith <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2009/03/black-hole-alert-aig-to-get-as-much-as.html">goes for the slam dunk</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Let&#8217;s see, the credit default swaps market, due to some netting, is now somewhere north of $30 trillion (as opposed to its earlier &#8220;north of $60 trillion&#8221; level). Investment banks were believed to have hedged most of their exposure via offsetting contracts, but AIG wrote naked protection. And as jAIG itself is at risk of getting downgraded again, the collateral posting requirements keep rising.</p>
<p>Some analysts (including Chris Whalen of Institutional Risk Analytics) have offered theories as to how the government could void a lot of CDS (some have argued for getting rid of them altogether, others argue for eliminating them in cases where the protection buyer does not hold the underlying bond/exposure). Before you say, &#8220;they can&#8217;t do that&#8221;, recall the effective confiscation of gold in the Great Depression. rationing, wage and price controls, the suspension of habeus corpus. There is a good deal that the Feds could do if they chose to, trust me. But it&#8217;s easier to bill the poor chump taxpayer than take on the financiers, even after they done so much damage.</p></blockquote>
<p>And in the other corner, I am joined by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2009/03/02/the-aig-scandal">Felix Salmon</a>, who rejects the slam:<br />
<blockquote>The scandal here is not the size of the losses from the global financial meltdown &#8212; those are losses which sooner or later, in one form or another, would have had to be borne by the government anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem, as obliquely noted by me (&#8220;So there is a viable, separable business that is making pennies [US$0.01] while the rest of the firm loses Benjamins [US$100.00]&#8221;) and explicitly declared by Yves is summarized well by Felix, in a statement to which I suspect all three of us would agree:<br />
<blockquote>Rather, the scandal is that AIG could have earned billions of dollars by selling insurance against a meltdown, even as it was wholly incapable of paying out on those policies. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to learn that Hank Greenberg was still a billionaire, even as the policies his company wrote have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/government-says-commitment-aig-totals/story.aspx?guid=%7B092C3164-83F3-439B-B5A2-2306E0597D84%7D">cost</a> the average American household some $1,600. It&#8217;s time for his wealth to be confiscated: it might be only a drop in the bucket compared to AIG&#8217;s total losses, but it would feel very right.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I suggested yesterday of the successor-AIG, &#8220;So long as that board doesn&#8217;t include Hank Greenberg, I&#8217;ll be cautiously optimistic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that&#8217;s probably not the way to bet.  More on that later; for now, keep watching Joe Nocera <a target="_blank" href="http://executivesuite.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/who-are-we-really-propping-up-with-the-aig-bailout/">deliver</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://executivesuite.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/27/is-aig-the-worst-of-them-all/">the</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/business/28nocera.html?_r=1&#038;ref=business&#038;pagewanted=print">goods</a> and summarize the issue:<br />
<blockquote>Yet the government feels it has no choice: because of A.I.G.’s dubious business practices&#8230;it pretty much has the world’s financial system by the throat&#8230;.</p>
<p>A bailout of A.I.G. is really a bailout of its trading partners — which essentially constitutes the entire Western banking system. [edits mine*]</p></blockquote>
<p>By the way, Joe, <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2009/03/black-hole-alert-aig-to-get-as-much-as.html">Yves, citing an early Bloomberg report, named some names</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Societe Generale SA, Deutsche Bank AG and Merrill Lynch &#038; Co. are among the largest banks that bought swaps from AIG, according to a person familiar with the situation. The insurer handed over about $18.7 billion to financial firms in the three weeks after the September bailout, said the person, who declined to be named because the information hasn’t been made public.</p></blockquote>
<p>*Which improves the NYT editing, since the fact of the &#8220;housing bubble&#8221; has nothing to do with AIG&#8217;s mis- and malfeasances.</p>

                                <p>By divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Via C &#038; L via CR comes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/opinion/01endintro.html?_r=1">the NYT asking</a> when will the recession be over.  They have 11different responses.  Roubini is there suggesting we could see an L curve.<br />
<blockquote>We now face a 1 in 3 chance that, if appropriate policies are not put in place, this ugly U-shaped recession may turn into a more virulent L-shaped near-depression or stag-deflation (a deadly combination of economic stagnation and price deflation) like the one Japan experienced in the 1990s after its real estate and equity bubbles burst.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course there is one response titled: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/opinion/01poole.html">Stop the Bailouts</a>. Can you guess the ideology? (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kato_(The_Green_Hornet)">Hint</a>.)</p>
<p>Calculated Risk highlighted  STEPHEN S.ROACH (Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia),  A. MICHAEL SPENCE (Stanford Professor, Nobel prize, economics) and GEORGE COOPER (author of “The Origin of Financial Crises: Central Banks, Credit Bubbles and the Efficient Market Fallacy”).  All three came up with 2010/2011.  Although, they all noted &#8220;if&#8217;s&#8221; as to government action, including the world&#8217;s governments and maybe lingering effects.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll go with the following.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/opinion/01ferguson.html">Niall Ferguson</a> is a professor at Harvard and the author of “The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World.” <br />
<blockquote>This is a crisis of excessive debt, the end of the Age of Leverage. It will take longer than a few more months to resolve bank and household insolvency, especially with asset prices continuing to fall so rapidly.  Even with zero interest rates and huge deficits, Japan suffered a “lost decade” in the 1990s — and that was when the rest of the world was doing well. This recession is taking place as the rest of the world is doing even worse than the United States. The collapse of trade as measured by East Asian export data is petrifying&#8230;At the moment, I find it quite easy to imagine two consecutive years of contraction. And I don’t rule out two more lean years after that.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/opinion/01reinhart.html">Carmen M. Reinhart</a> is a professor of economics at the University of Maryland.<br />
<blockquote>Counting the months of decline, however, is a narrow gauge of distress. A better metric is the length of time it takes the economy to recover to the level of per capita income at its prior peak. </p>
<p>After the most severe banking crises around the world in the postwar period, the economy has taken an average of four years to return to its previous peak in personal income. After the Depression, it took the United States 10 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow? Someone basing the issue of the recession and it&#8217;s conclusion on how much income people have. </p>
<p>Do you think we can get her to consider the split of that income?  After all, in that 10 year depression recovery the top 1% share declined from 22.35% to 16.68%.  But (big but) in 1936 it popped up to 19.29%, then we had 1937.  By 1939 (10 yrs) it was back to 16.18% and never saw anything close to it until 1986&#8217;s 15.92% (from 12.67the year before).  We hit 22% in 2005!</p>

                                <p>Dr. Black (you know the site) links to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2009/03/01/business/business-us-aig.html?pagewanted=print">AIG Strike Three</a>.  And unlike the Citi debacle previously discussed <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/treasury-and-citi.html">(relatively) positively</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/can-we-stop-pretending-nationalisation.html">rather negatively</a> here, this one makes some form of sense.</p>
<p>The difference comes down to the meaning of an accounting concept: ongoing concern.</p>
<p>More below the break (yes, this might get wonkish. It&#8217;s me, after all.)</p>
<p>The Big C and AIG are both large entities with several pieces.  Some of those pieces are successful; some of them are <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/12/wapo-on-aig.html">AIG</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/12/aig-in-wapo-ii.html">Financial</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/12/wapo-on-aig-iii.html">Products</a>. Some of them—Citibank branches and office space, for instance—fall somewhere in between.</p>
<p>What we do know is that it is currently not possible to slice and dice The Big C so that something would be left that would be an &#8220;ongoing concern.&#8221;  Those assets that are part of the company are dwarfed by the liabilities, and run <em>across</em> business lines.  It&#8217;s not as if you could just magically, say, sell Smith Barney, spinoff any remaining insurance business, and ritually execute Vikram Pandit and produce a working company from the remains.  At best, it&#8217;s a Good Start.  There&#8217;s a reason I refer to the company as The Big C: it&#8217;s in the lymph nodes, the brain, the lungs, and the brain.  You probably couldn&#8217;t even survive with &#8220;just&#8221; the Retail and Private Banking operations.</p>
<p>Any auditor who releases The Big C&#8217;s next 10-Q and describes the firm as a(n) &#8220;(on)going concern&#8221;**—with the attendant implication that there is a functional business model there and that the firm can create the future unencumbered* cash flows to remain viable—should be barred from the accounting profession.</p>
<p>AIG is different.  Think Enron: there are pieces of the business that are still viable (now, the insurance and re-insurance pieces; then, the power plants and transmission facilities), but they are dwarfed by the losses at AIGFP.  So there is a viable, separable business that is making pennies while the rest of the firm loses Benjamins.</p>
<p>The difference is that there is a possible end in sight. AIG-Prime could go back to doing the things AIG knew how to do, and stay away from the things that made Hank Greenberg rich and pauperized U.S. taxpayers.***</p>
<p>So, if we were to assume that a leaner, less mean AIG will come out of this, can we look at the plan changes and say they point toward a goal?</p>
<p>Unlike The Big C, the answer is clearly &#8220;yes.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>Under the deal, the interest rate on AIG&#8217;s credit line from the government would be cut to match the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), now about 1.26 percent, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is perfectly reasonable for the moment: AIG is a financial institution, the reconceived version will be a financial institution of respectable size and strength, and the current version has the strong support of the U.S. government, which can borrow well inside LIBOR.  While I suspect the final company will end up looking more like State Farm than Morgan Stanley, it&#8217;s not out of the question that it could borrow at LIBOR, which is approximately a AA rating level anyway—a perfectly reasonable assumption for the reconstitution of a formerly-AAA company with some carryover liabilities.<br />
<blockquote>The additional equity commitment would give AIG the ability to issue preferred stock to the government later, the sources said.</p></blockquote>
<p>This would presumably be the reverse of the deal with The Big C: &#8220;equity&#8221; for debt.  Again, a sign that regulators expect there to be a survivor/successor firm of the current mess.</p>
<p>The most interesting quote in the piece is:<br />
<blockquote>[Robert Haines, senior insurance analyst at CreditSights] said. &#8220;The counterparties on most of the book are (European) banks that would be hammered if the U.S. walked away.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that Mr. Haines does not speak of AIG as an independent entity. Note also that, in supporting the AIGFP fiasco/deals, the U.S. can reduce the overall size of the bailout needed while ensuring that domestic entities retain full access to capital markets.  It doesn&#8217;t make anyone happy, but the option is worth keeping open.</p>
<p>Then we get to the meat of the deal:<br />
<blockquote>AIG will also give the U.S. Federal Reserve a preferred interest in its American Life Insurance Co (Alico), which generates more than half of its revenue from Japan, and Hong Kong-based life insurance group American International Assurance Co (AIA) in return for reducing its debt, they said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The U.S. doesn&#8217;t really want to own either of these, but they have a promise to be valuable assets.<br />
<blockquote>The government likely will get a 5 percent cumulative dividend on its ownership stake in Alico and AIA, said one source. AIG had been trying to sell Alico and part of AIA in a bid to raise money to pay back the government.</p>
<p>Sales of these assets are still a possibility, with some bids already received, said one person. [italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Think very carefully about the italicized part above.  Markets clear—but they don&#8217;t always flow well.  Combining the two, it appears that the government is effectively giving AIG a bridge loan on those two entities.  In the worst case, it will become a &#8220;pier loan&#8221; (h/t <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&#038;as_qdr=all&#038;q=%22pier+loans%22+site%3Acalculatedrisk.blogspot.com&#038;btnG=Search&#038;meta=">CR</a>), but that&#8217;s not the way to bet, especially if others follow <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0220/p25s19-wosc.html">the Chinese model of buying international assets while they are cheaper</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of the moves look as if the outlines of the new company are already falling into place:<br />
<blockquote>AIG may also securitize some U.S. life insurance policies and give them to the government to further reduce its debt, the source said.</p>
<p>The company may securitize up to $10 billion under that plan, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>The debt-to-equity swap would help AIG repay much of the roughly $38 billion it has drawn from its government credit line, the source said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: we know this business, and can do it well and continue it.<br />
<blockquote>Last year, AIG said it planned to sell all assets except its U.S. property and casualty business, foreign general insurance and an ownership interest in some foreign life operations, to pay back the government.</p>
<p>While the company has announced some sales, it has found it difficult to find buyers and get a good price for assets amid the financial crisis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation, again: if the market ever comes back, this is what we plan to look like. And we will again be a &#8220;going concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>In short, unlike The Big C, there is a plan, there are moves afoot to move closer to the end game, and targets by which they plan to keep the viable parts of the business going. For instance,<br />
<blockquote>The company now plans to spin off up to 20 percent of the property-casualty business in an initial public offering, said a person with direct knowledge of the plans.</p>
<p>The business would be renamed to differentiate it from AIG, and have its own board of directors.</p></blockquote>
<p>So long as that board doesn&#8217;t include Hank Greenberg, I&#8217;ll be cautiously optimistic. The other piece of spinoff is more problematic:<br />
<blockquote>To aid the auction of at least one major asset, the government could help potential buyers of aircraft lessor International Lease Finance Corp with financing, the sources said.</p>
<p>ILFC has some debt coming due in 2009 and, if needed, AIG could use its new equity commitment to help potential buyers with that, one of the sources said.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a piece that probably still needs to exist for non-business reasons, at which point we might be able to argue that there could be a Public Good in government support of its sale.  Under any condition, it doesn&#8217;t fit into the trimmed-down model of AIG-Prime that appears to be envisioned.</p>
<p>None of this means there won&#8217;t be another round—asset sales are very dependent on buyers—or that they should be paying non-contractual bonuses this month (which they are).  The company still needs to reach its full restructuring, and this is not exactly a prime time to be a seller in the marketplace.  But at least this restructuring/new bailout has a clear Endgame in sight.</p>
<p>*I use &#8220;unencumbered&#8221; in place of the usual &#8220;free&#8221; for the sake of clarity.<br />**It appears that &#8220;Ongoing concern&#8221; is used in the U.K., &#8220;going concern&#8221; in the U.S.  I won&#8217;t pretend to know which will be the standard as accounting standards are <s>weakened</s> standardized.<br />***This is, of course, another case where I will point to the results and ask how anyone can take &#8220;we&#8217;ll get 2/3s of the money back&#8221; seriously.

<p>Brad DeLong has a question.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/02/notes-on-christie-romers-friday-speech.html">He is impressed by Christine Romer&#8217;s latest speech but he doesn&#8217;t believe the huge estimate</a> (on the order of 3) of the tax cut multiplier in <a href="http://www.economics.ucr.edu/seminars/fall06/ets/Romer11-27-06.pdf">Romer and Romer 2007 (warning pdf)</a>.</p>
<p>He suspects that they left something out.  </p>
<blockquote><p>I agree that the evidence for large multipliers (on the order of 3) in Romer and Romer is striking. But I find it disturbing: I don&#8217;t see why some of the channels they find are as strong as they are&#8211;the tremendously strong investment accelerator, for example. And thus I fear that their estimates too suffer from some opposite omitted variable bias that I am not smart enough to identify.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regular readers of AngryBear will not be puzzled.  Cactus has been <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/further-critique-of-romer-and-romer.html">there</a> also <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/confusing-keynesian-effects-and-supply.html">pgl</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/11/kevin-drum-asks-romers-some-questions.html">this guy (I forgot honest)</a>.</p>
<p>After the jump I explain 3 ways in which the 3 might be overestimated.</p>
<p>Before the jump, I&#8217;d just like to mention that it was an excellent speech (just click the link at <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/02/notes-on-christie-romers-friday-speech.html">Brad&#8217;s post</a>).  She politely responded to Mankiw noting (as he has noted himself) that the R&#038;R estimates of the effects of taxes can&#8217;t be compared to standard estimates of the effects of spending and that they couldn&#8217;t have dealt with spending (spending bills are too long for even the Romers to be willing to read every one and classify all changes in spending &#8212; sheesh).  She also noted that addition to looking at rationed consumption and planned private investment during wwII (to support the claim that the multiplier is 0.8</p>
<p>OK enough niceness.  First, Brad is using his tone for dealing with on leave colleagues whose courses I am teaching so I better make sure they know they are welcome back at Berkeley.  So he doesn&#8217;t say that the Romers&#8217; data was data (given in Italian and Latin) to the Romers by the Romers reading and deciding.   Cactus was pretty ruthless on that point.</p>
<p>However, the discussion also makes it clear that smart people interpreted Romer and Romer 2007 as a vindication of supply side economics.  Kevin Drum was clearly also sincere.  It sure isn&#8217;t, because R&#038;R looked at short run effects and assumed they were Keynesian.  However, you don&#8217;t have to join the Club For Growth to believe that the estimates are biased up by supply side effects.  In particular supply side effects can imply that the tax cut multiplier is greater than the spending multiplier (you have to go pretty much the full Laffer to believe that, but Mankiw was willing to go there (and to the Romers&#8217; wedding where he was the best man)).</p>
<p>I find more convincing the possibility that tax cuts tricked managers into a bit of irrational exuberance, because they really do believe the supply side line deep down (or at least aren&#8217;t sure it is wrong).</p>
<p>In particular recall that the Romers found a huge effect of taxes on investment.</p>
<p>This would happen if some businessmen bought into the supply side mumbo jumbo (they don&#8217;t have to go the whole Laffer, they just have to believe, for example, that tax cuts will cause a permanent increase in the growth rate).</p>
<p>Now represenatives of business do argue for tax cuts all the time. It is tempting to assume that their calculation doesn&#8217;t go beyond their paymasters&#8217; personal bottom line (I mean the people who call the tune not the shareholders). But maybe they aren&#8217;t hypocrites and really think that exogenous tax cuts cause an increase in trend growth making it a good time to invest.</p>
<p>So tax cuts have Keynesian effects and cause a bit of irrational exuberance. Seems to fit the facts no ?</p>
