                                <p><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article19956.htm">Information Clearinghouse</a> gets a h/t for this article in <strong>LA Times </strong>&#8212; &#8211; May 9, 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1961, Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his famous farewell address as president, warned of the &#8220;acquisition of unwarranted influence&#8221; by what he called the &#8220;military-industrial complex&#8221; in the United States. Today, however, the &#8220;large arms industry&#8221; of Eisenhower&#8217;s day is only part of a complex equation. Civilian firms such as PepsiCo and IBM form the backbone of what more accurately can be described as a &#8220;military-corporate complex.&#8221; These businesses allow the Pentagon to function, to make war and to carry out foreign occupations.</p>
<p>For example, in 2006 (the last year for which official figures are available), PepsiCo and IBM ranked among the Pentagon&#8217;s top 100 contractors, taking in $286,696,943 and $291,825,309, respectively. This was no aberration. The previous year, they received $233,053,993 and $382,408,117 each, according to Department of Defense documents. In fact, both companies have been defense contractors every year since at least 2000. And there isn&#8217;t anything special or odd about PepsiCo or IBM, when it comes to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Almost a decade after Eisenhower&#8217;s farewell address, there were still only 22,000 prime contractors doing business with the Department of Defense. Today, that number tops 47,000. While the well-known giant arms makers &#8212; Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics &#8212; remain the largest contractors, they are dwarfed by the sheer number of fellow contractors from all imaginable economic sectors.</p>
<p>These stretch from coast to coast and around the globe, from entertainment giants such as Columbia TriStar and Twentieth Century Fox to auto-making titans Ford and General Motors to Big Pharma power players such as Pfizer. Even the Krispy Kreme Doughnuts chain took in almost $500,000 from the Pentagon in 2006, while Coca-Cola cleaned up with more than $100 million in taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>In 2006, the Pentagon&#8217;s list of its top 100 suppliers also included such well-known civilian firms as Tyson Foods ($335,239,095), Goodrich Corp. ($344,091,017), Procter &#038; Gamble ($362,461,808), Kraft Foods ($500,799,104), Dell ($636,343,593), ExxonMobil ($1,176,354,936), FedEx ($1,303,032,027) and General Electric ($2,327,705,161). Also on the Pentagon&#8217;s 2006 payroll were such often-ignored defense contractors as the animated mouse-house, the Walt Disney Co.; iPod-maker Apple; sunglasses purveyor Oakley; cocoa giant Nestle; ketchup producer Heinz; and chocolate bar maker Hershey.</p>
<p>These are, in fact, today&#8217;s &#8220;typical defense contractors.&#8221; They are the companies that regularly take in tax-funded payouts from the Pentagon for services and goods (chiefly for the more than 1.3 million active members of the armed services). Few realize the actual look and shape of the new &#8220;militarized&#8221; U.S. economy. It&#8217;s not just the classic &#8220;permanent armaments industry&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s civilian and it&#8217;s widespread.</p></blockquote>
<p>Such large sums of money through privatizing supply makes for interesting connections with products of everyday civilian life.  What I have not been able to find are data on the weight of soldiers just prior to going on tour to the weight of soldiers just after finishing their tours&#8230;whoppers and pepsi rations in between.</p>

<blockquote><p>I think Barack Obama has accidentally discovered the easiest way to defeat John McCain this November: make him mad. We&#8217;ve all heard the stories about McCain&#8217;s legendarily cranky temper, and he sure showed where those stories came from on Thursday when he erupted after Obama had the temerity to disagree with him about Jim Webb&#8217;s GI Bill extension. Get a grip, Senator.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/john_mccain_/2008/05/bad_day_for_john_mccain_part_ii_anger_management.php">Mark Kleiman</a> has the details.  But I guess screwing veterans is fiscally necessary if one is adamant about paying for those tax cuts.  After all – the GOP mantra in late 2001 when they were pushing for more tax cuts for the rich was “do it for the troops”.</p>

                                <p>Mirror mirror on the wall, how can a bank can make easy money for all? Step forward Citigroup and its stalwart Falcon hedge fund.</p>
<p>Banks take out life insurance policies on its employees. When the employee dies, the bank collects&#8211;tax free. BOLI accounts, they are called (Bank Owed Life Insurance).</p>
<p>And how does this little gimmick generate cash? Hedge fund operators, using the hedge fund as the support vehicle, garner, I am sure, very nice bonuses. The banks, of course, now have a tax dodge.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23731045-36375,00.html">Additionally</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;many banks have grown aggressive with their BOLI programs, putting premiums into investment vehicles that let the banks record quarterly profits &#8212; or losses. </p></blockquote>
<p>Smiles and high fives all around, I am sure.</p>
<p>Of course, when Falcon stumbled, so did the banks, Wachovia and Fifth Third among them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Falcon began stumbling last &#8230; autumn and by March 31 was valued at 20 per cent of the original value, according to Citigroup documents. </p>
<p>Fifth Third, which reaped $US238 million in gains on its BOLI portfolio in a three-year period, suffered a BOLI-related loss of $US177 million in the fourth quarter and $US152 million loss in 2008&#8217;s first quarter. </p>
<p>At Wachovia, Falcon&#8217;s woes caused the bank&#8217;s first-quarter loss to widen to $US708 million from its previously announced $US393 million loss.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit, Fifth Third alleges that Transamerica Life Insurance and Clark Consulting, both units of Dutch insurer Aegon, &#8220;utterly failed to properly manage and monitor&#8221; premiums that were invested in Falcon. Citigroup is not named as a defendant. A Fifth Third spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We live, apparently, in a financial sewer, with rats and other vermin looking for tasty meals. Occasionally, they gnaw on one another. Yet we celebrate the massive bonuses that all this innovation brings. Money is being made. This is what a bank does.</p>
<p>I remember that marvelous Smith Barney ad: &#8220;<i>We make money the old-fashion way: We earn it.</i>&#8221; Smith Barney is, of course, &#8220;the global private wealth management unit of Citigroup.&#8221; In an age of gloss and glamour, the moral compass spins wildly.</p>
<p>Personally, I would not trust these rascals with my grandchildren&#8217;s piggy banks.  I think it is time to flush the sewers and start fresh.  It is time to pull the plug on these financial geniuses and the climate of greed that has spawned them.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Reader Arne, a long time and well informed commenter submitted to Tuesday&#8217;s Social Security post a list of seven deceptively simple in form questions to get my take on them. Which I gave in comments. Unfortunately what HaloScan gives it can take away and a time this morning both his questions and my answers had vanished. Well they came back and I thought it useful to front page them and invite readers either to attempt their own answers or comment on mine.</p>
<p>Remember the rules. Anyone can ask for a response to a question or argument. No one has the right to demand one. Silence in this case does not equate to consent.That said what is on your mind? Anything related to Social Security is fair game. But first over to Arne.</p>
<p>Here are some questions I think are interesting, but I would prefer to see Bruce post them with his thoughts and for others to try to stay tightly on-topic. </p>
<p>1) What should we do if the SSA intermedicate forecast is right? When and how would we change? <br />2) Which is really more important, productivity or demographics?<br />3) Given that the TF lasts at least 20 more years, is moving (some of) it from US Treasuries to equities a good idea? How does that change with LC instead of IC?<br />4) Is solvency relevent? {mild edit to remove a side irrelevant side issue} <br />5) Are the stochastic projections (Appendix E) meaningful?<br />6) What do the 1984 and 1985 reports show us about intent?<br />7) Why did the TF ratio outperform expectations in the late 90&#8217;s? Can it do so again?</p>
<p>1. Well there are two answers to that. One would rely on what I call Rosser&#8217;s Equation and point out that &#8216;crisis&#8217; means a 78% result of a benefit scheduled at 160% relative to what similarly situated retirees get today. Since 78% of 160% = 125% and the event if and when will come after I am gone, I don&#8217;t see why I should get exercised about this one way or another. Particularly if the plan to avoid sticker shock is just to phase it in faster. So one perfectly good response is Nothing.</p>
<p>The second answer would be to point out with Coberly that a tax based solution is in fact pretty cheap. The current payroll gap is down to 1.7% of payroll which for a household of $50,000 would require an $850 a year fix, or half that if you examine that from an employer/employee split. But as I argue in Cost of Inactivity the trend short term is good and mathematically calculates out to Nothing for now as well.</p>
<p>The legal answer is to wait until the Social Security system falls out of Short Term Actuarial Balance. Under Intermediate Cost assumptions the TF ratio falls below 100 in around 2036, meaning the system would fail the test some nine years earlier or in 2027 which would leave 14 years to 2041 to come to a policy decision, which would be plenty of time and a much more informed information environment. Of course if depletion continues to move out in time then so would this decision point. So once again the answer to your question in the here and now is Nothing. Ask me again in 2027.</p>
<p>2. For decision making? Productivity. Because the Demographics are already built into the model and do not vary much over the short term that will be determinative, which is to say the 2009 to 2012 time period. Fluctuations in fertility obviously only manifest themselves 21 years or so out of phase. Whereas year over year productivity can vary greatly.</p>
<p>3. Diversification of the Trust Fund is in my view a good thing, though equities would not be my choice of asset class. The question is to some degree moot under IC. Surpluses start shrinking after 2017 and vanish after 2023. Given that fairly short investment window the difference in yield probably wouldn&#8217;t offset the risk of markets crashing at just the wrong time. We would be a little embarrassed if the Great Crash of 2023 wiped out most of our portfolio just as we needed to cash parts of it in. Under LC I would argue that diversification is almost an absolute necessity in that it avoids the Interest on Interest problem. If we assume Low Cost and took the current surplus and invested it in outside assets and then reinvested the earnings we would have a chance to really build a portfolio. Under Low Cost the time to tap the Trust Fund portfolio does not start until 2023 and at a much lower rate amounting to 25% of the interest accrued from a portfolio of Special Treasuries, presumedly something less with better yielding outside assets. You can do quite a bit with a reinvestment rate of say 80% of earnings. As to asset class I would pick school and transportation bonds which would serve to create jobs, lower borrowing costs to states and local jurisdictions, yet maintain the predictability of Treasuries.</p>
<p>4. Solvency is relevant because opponents of Social Security have framed the argument in those terms. They chose not to fight this out on straight out ideological, pro market terms. Instead they sold the message of &#8216;bankrupt&#8217;. I can only fight on the battlefield in play and for the most part that is one of Solvency.</p>
<p>5. I don&#8217;t find the Stochastic Projections compelling. I am even less a statistician than I am an economist but the following passage was troubling. Perhaps you could explain it:</p>
<p>&#8220;Each time-series equation is designed such that, in the absence of random variation, the value of the variable would equal the value assumed under the intermediate set of assumptions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The language in Appendix E is rather opaque, perhaps deliberately so, but it seems to build in the assumption that is actually in challenge, that Intermediate Cost is overall a reasonable median. But really the question of the Stochastics are above my pay grade.</p>
<p>6. Well the unkind answer would be to say &#8216;Look&#8217; and link to http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html but I went ahead and checked the 1985 Summary. They essentially gave the system a clean bill of health with the actuarial deficit of Intermediate II-B only being .41% while the 1985 definition of &#8216;close actuarial balance&#8217; was &#8216;estimated average annual income rate between 95% and 105% of the average cost rate&#8217;. So I would sum their intent as &#8216;maybe we fixed it, but lets keep a close eye on it&#8217;. Because they were only .09% of payroll of falling outside their preferred band.<br />http://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/1985.pdf</p>
<p>7. Well that one is easy. Whether you take as your key variable Real GDP, Real Wage, population in employment all were way ahead of expectations. Whether the late nineties could happen again depends of what you think caused it to happen in the first place, a question which has economists of all ideological types coming up with different answers. Personally I am a little more optimistic that those times could come again. Then again they are not needed to achieve Low Cost results. Low Cost only assumes 2.8% ultimate GDP and 2.0% productivity both well below the rates we were seeing in the late 90s. Which is probably the least understood thing about Low Cost. In historical context its numbers seem to be pretty low hanging fruit. To me anyway, I am still waiting for someone to explain why no year in the future could possibly be as good as 2006. I don&#8217;t need to appeal back to 1999.</p>
<p>Fire away.</p>

Here is another piece of the action.</p>
<blockquote><p>Credit is scarce but not capital. Mortgage-ravaged banks and Wall Street firms often have to borrow from the Federal Reserve, as lender of last resort, to meet current bills. They have no problem at all raising big sums from investors for future use.<br />In recent months, these financial companies have sold $262 billion in new securities &#8212; much of it common and preferred stock &#8212; according to Bloomberg data. This gives them capital they need to offset losses from subprime mortgages that now total $343 billion.</p>
<p>Investors obviously don&#8217;t see this as throwing good money after bad: They eagerly buy more shares than the companies initially planned to sell.</p>
<p>Late last month, Citigroup Inc., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, planned to sell $3 billion in common stock. Investor demand boosted the total by 50 percent to $4.5 billion. People bought without assurance that the bank&#8217;s need for capital was sated.</p>
<p>Citigroup so far is the champion capital-raiser, refurbishing its balance sheet with $44 billion in new money. There&#8217;s symmetry here. Citigroup&#8217;s subprime-related losses are also the highest, at $41 billion.</p>
<p>American International Group Inc., the biggest insurance company by assets, got stuck in the subprime mire too, by guaranteeing payment on loans. The company had a first-quarter net loss of $7.8 billion. Still, last week AIG said it had raised more than the $12.5 billion in new capital it had planned.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Stocks and Bonds</p>
<p>The company said it sold $11.9 billion in common shares and units that can be converted into common and might offer more of both to meet investors&#8217; demand. AIG also sold $4 billion in bonds. AIG&#8217;s loss and new capital figures aren&#8217;t included in the Bloomberg data cited above.</p>
<p>Though others damaged by subprime losses have cut their dividends to conserve cash, AIG on May 8 raised its quarterly dividend to 22 cents a share from 20 cents. The company is in effect raising money from new investors to pay off old stockholders &#8212; a modern-day Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p>Wachovia Corp., the fourth-largest U.S. bank, was able to sell $8 billion in common and preferred stock last month, $1 billion more than planned. No matter that the bank was absorbing losses from once-popular mortgages that allowed homeowners to skip some interest payments and add the amount to principal.</p>
<p>Washington Mutual Inc., the biggest U.S. savings and loan, with subprime losses so far of $8.3 billion, sold $7 billion in common and convertible preferred shares in April to investors led by David Bonderman&#8217;s TPG Inc. The company has raised a total of $10 billion in new capital.</p>
<p>Real Money</p>
<p>UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, has reported $38 billion in write-offs and other losses from mortgages. It has raised $28 billion in capital. Merrill Lynch &#038; Co., the third- biggest U.S. securities firm, has brought in $18 billion in new money against its subprime-related losses of $32 billion.</p>
<p>The parade will continue. Freddie Mac, which supports the U.S. mortgage market by purchasing loans from lenders, said last week it plans to sell $5.5 billion of common and preferred shares soon.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac and its sister government-sponsored company Fannie Mae may be in the market for money repeatedly in the months ahead as the U.S. government looks to them to keep the mortgage market liquid.</p>
<p>Investors may feel they can&#8217;t lose by putting money into financial companies. The Federal Reserve &#8212; by engineering the takeover of Bear Stearns Cos. by JPMorgan Chase &#038; Co. in March &#8211; &#8211; showed that no company big enough to have a major impact on the banking system will be allowed to fail.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, both Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson have urged banks and investment firms to raise more capital so that they can lend more and boost the economy. People also may be intrigued by their ability to buy stock at a haircut from the market price.</p>
<p>Still, when they buy common shares and preferred stock convertible into common, they dilute the earnings potential of all stockholders. And when the companies have to sell more shares in the future, that process starts all over again.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/20/AR2008052001912.html">The Washington Post</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>With scores of lenders unable to come up with money to provide student loans, the Department of Education is preparing to exercise broad new powers in the coming weeks that could fundamentally recast how millions of students pay for college.</p>
<p>This initiative could transform the federal government from a guarantor of student loans into the dominant provider, replacing the outside lenders to whom students and their families have long turned. Though the Education Department has been making a portion of these federally backed loans, it is now aiming to dramatically expand its role as a direct lender to fill the void created by an exodus of private-sector lenders, due primarily to the credit crisis.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Traditionally, there have been two primary sources of student loans guaranteed by the federal government. About a fifth have come from the Education Department itself. Outside lenders have represented a far larger share of the market. But now, as the mortgage crisis has crippled the broader credit markets, many firms are exiting the student loan business, saying it&#8217;s no longer profitable. The expanded role of the Education Department &#8212; both as a direct lender and a source of capital to other lenders &#8212; is just one of the fundamental changes sweeping through the student loan industry. According to FinAid, 88 lenders, including 25 of the largest firms, have announced they will no longer offer federally guaranteed loans, citing their difficulty in getting financing from the troubled credit markets.<br />&#8230;</p>
<p>Now, the department is being asked to issue far more loans this year than it ever has in the past. Last year, the department provided $14 billion in federally guaranteed loans directly to students. This summer, during the peak of the student-lending season, that share is expected to more than double and possibly reach $35 billion, or about half the market, according to FinAid and other analysts.</p>
<p>In addition, the department will likely have to take over the market that consolidates federally guaranteed loans for post-graduates. This is a $37 billion business that allows these borrowers to combine all of their student loans into one package with a single, relatively low rate. Already, lenders representing 77 percent of the consolidation market have dropped out since the start of the credit crisis. Department officials said they are prepared to hire contractors to handle this burden.</p>
<p>Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, recently sent a letter to the presidents of all the nation&#8217;s universities, urging them to join the direct-lending program as soon as possible. He is concerned that a flood of requests to switch to the direct-loan program will come late in the summer and overwhelm the department, aides said. Since the beginning of March, nearly 300 universities and colleges have applied to make their students eligible for direct loans from the government.</p>
<p>Some leading Democrats in Congress have urged the government to take responsibility for providing all federally guaranteed loans. Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Barack Obama (D-Ill.) have both said that, as president, they would hand the entire market to the Department of Education.</p>
<p>At the same time that the department is expanding its direct loan program, its officials are also working with financial experts from several federal agencies, including the Treasury, the Council of Economic Advisers, and the Office of Management and Budget, to plan for purchasing loans from other lenders. Officials familiar with the plan, which is likely to involve money from the Treasury, said it may take weeks to release details.</p>
<p>Kennedy and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Education and Labor Committee, are also preparing a letter that asks the Government Accountability Office to keep a close eye on how the measure is carried out because the department is required to buy student loans in a way that does not result in a loss for taxpayers.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>A few days ago in a post on Greg Mankiw we got into a discussion of stock market valuation where vtcouger wondered about using 10 year trailing earnings to evaluate stocks.  vtcouger wondered why Benjamin Graham recommended using 10 year trailing earnings rather then one year trailing earnings.  Remember, Benjamin Graham was writing in the 1930s when earnings volatility was much greater then since WW II. Moreover, earnings growth was much weaker<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SDShlKtg4CI/AAAAAAAAAQk/l9-CKnVsQYg/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SDShlKtg4CI/AAAAAAAAAQk/l9-CKnVsQYg/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>As the chart shows, from 19871 to 1940 EPS growth was only 2% and the volatility was much greater.  It was so great that if you used trailing one year earning growth to estimate  stock market valuation it could generate major problems. For example, the day FDR was elected president  was one of the best time  ever to buy stocks.  But based on trailing one year earnings the market PE was 25,which said the market was massively overvalued.  To get around that problem Graham and Dodd advocated using trailing 10 year earnings.  This measure of EPS would include both peak earning and trough earnings and so generate an estimate of normalized or trend earnings so that investors would not be mislead by using peak or trough earnings to calculate stock valuations.</p>
<p>Just as an aside, note that from 1875 to 1900 EPS did not grow.  But we see many people talking about that as a great era of prosperity and deflation. I wonder how many of those who thing the late 1800s was so great would really be happy with decades of falling earnings or profits.</p>
<p>Since WW II earnings growth has become much more stable and market valuation has come to depend on future earnings growth rather than dividends.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SDShwqtg4DI/AAAAAAAAAQs/nmrp8TLusHc/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SDShwqtg4DI/AAAAAAAAAQs/nmrp8TLusHc/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Corporation now retain a much larger share of earnings and investors buy stocks much more on the basis of expected future growth from these retained earnings rather than current dividends that were so important to Graham and Dodd. Note, when they wrote in the 1930s expected earnings growth was 2% and now it is 7% and in the late 1990s bubble it was even higher.</p>
<p>But investors still have the problem that basing valuation of peak earnings or trough earnings can distort valuations even though EPS growth is now much more stable then it was before WW II.  For the market as a whole you can use the Graham and Dodd practice of using trailing 10 year EPS that includes both peak and trough EPS.  Another way to do it is to use trend EPS growth.  If you look at the above chart on EPS since 1960 you see the dotted 7% EPS growth trend.  So rather than using actual trailing EPS, or forecast EPS, use this trend line to estimate market valuation.  This chart does just that.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SDSh4atg4EI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/5vJSWoNPx-g/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SDSh4atg4EI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/5vJSWoNPx-g/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>In addition I have shown my estimate of what the PE should be given current interest rates. The estimate is based on the actual relationship between 1960 and 1996 before the late 1990s bubble so it excludes the bubble from the regression results.</p>
<p>I hope this explains things to your satisfaction vtcouger.</p>
<p>Note: my EPS data is reported EPS until 1989 and since 1989 it is operating EPS.</p>

                                <p>Watching Cspan at lunch of the House debt on taxes and energy Rep Emanual stated there are currently 9300 unused oil drilling permits in the US.  The counter to the statement was from Rep McCrery: There must be a reason for them being unused.</p>
<p>Yes, obviously if they are unused there is a reason.  Any guess?  Of course, that they are unused McCrery noted is the reason why we need to drill in ANWR and all 3 coasts; East, West, Gulf.  Rep </p>
<p>McCrery seems to imply here that the permits are unusable.  Well, if they are unusable, then why are they still open?  Why have they not been returned as unusable and thus the ares of permit removed from the list of viable drilling property.  </p>
<p>Fascinating.  Being that we are not opening up any new refineries which is blamed on all sorts of things (usually those tree hugger types) where would all this oil, whether from the republican wish list of holes in the ground or the current 9300 ok&#8217;d potential holes in the ground be refined?  If not here, then we are exporting crude.  Will that offset our import costs?</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.farmland.org/programs/campaign/SubsidyTransformation.asp">American Farmland Trust</a> argues for the provision in the new farm bill that is being called ACRE:</p>
<blockquote><p>A genuine government safety net should protect farmers against unexpected losses in revenue (price multiplied by yield) based on actual market conditions, rather than pay farmers based on historical production or when prices fall below artificial targets set by Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/20/AR2008052001581.html">Dan Morgan</a> notes a potential problem with ACRE:</p>
<blockquote><p>A major new program in the recently enacted farm bill could increase taxpayer-financed payments to farmers by billions of dollars if high commodity prices decline to more typical levels, administration and congressional budget officials said yesterday &#8230; The voluntary program guarantees farmers a subsidy if they suffer losses because of low prices or poor crops. Since the amount of the subsidy for 2009 is tied to recent record prices, farmers could reap a windfall if prices drop suddenly &#8230; A blog item posted Monday by the agricultural magazine Pro Farmer described the new program, known as Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE), as &#8220;lucrative beyond expectations,&#8221; and said it is a &#8220;no brainer&#8221; for farmers to sign up for it.   The Agriculture Department estimates that subsidy payments to corn farmers alone could reach $10 billion a year if prices &#8211; which have been $5 to $6 a bushel &#8211; were to drop to $3.25 a bushel, a level seen as recently as last year &#8230; Currently, corn farmers receive a government subsidy when prices drop below $2.63 a bushel. But critics say that subsidy does not protect farmers who bring in low yields in a year when prices are high &#8230; But as the farm bill moved through Congress, lawmakers sweetened the subsidy provisions, in part to encourage more farmers to sign up. The final version of the program is more generous than ones proposed earlier by the House and the Bush administration. The new program insures a farmer&#8217;s revenue at close to the current high prices. USDA estimates that a farmer could draw a payment even with corn prices at $4.39 a bushel. &#8220;They have taken a good idea and gone to an extreme in terms of creating an opportunity for revenue flows at the highest possible level,&#8221; Conner said.</p></blockquote>
<p>President Bush wants to veto this bill.  On this one – I think he’s right!</p>
