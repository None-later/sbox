<p>&#8220;The young will pay more and get less.&#8221; More Nonsense from Robert Samuelson</p>
<p> Our old friend, Dean Baker at Beat the Press, does a good job of taking apart yet another screed by the execrable Robert J. Samuelson, faux economist for WaPo, whining about why nobody is jumping on board with cuts to &#8220;entitlements,&#8221; and particularly his old bugaboo, Social Security.  Google &#8220;Dean Baker Robert Samuelson is upset&#8221; and the first hit gives you the link (Sorry, the link title is too long for me to read it and my trying to put what I saw in just sent one to the general CEPR site, bah! (Anybody out there able to tell me how to overcome this bit when urls are too damned long too read, please?).  However, I want to pound the nails in a bit more.   </p>
<p>So, RJS provides this line that if there is not an adjustment to SS (and Medicare), then &#8220;The young will pay more and get less.&#8221;  Dean quotes this, but does not go far enough in showing how totally ridiculous this is, even though he has pointed out recently that one reason there should be no adjustments for SS now is that the young are massively misinformed about what the not so bad fiscal situation of SS is.  Large proportions of them are fully convinced that they will receive no Social Security when they retire because it will be &#8220;bankrupt,&#8221; when in fact that condition will amount to them only getting something like 120% of current retirees&#8217; benefits in real terms rather than more like 170% (a bit lower, actually).  They are totally out of it, and the main threat to them losing their future benefits is if they support the sort of dreck that RJS is pushing, to cut their future benefits now because otherwise they might have their future benefits cut in the future (eeeeek!).    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Let me be more pointed.  RJS&#8217;s statement is simply a lie.  The proposals to cut Social Security have generally taken two forms recently: imposing a chain price index and adding another round of retirement age increases in the future beyond those that were imposed by the Greenspan Commission nearly 30 years ago and which are still coming in.  The former is estimated to reduce cost of living increases by about 0.3% per year, and this would over the next few years indeed gradually reduce what elders receive in benefits, although it is not at all clear that this will lead to any reduction in what the young will be paying, unless this is accompanied by another round of fica tax cutting, or fica is restructured to have the same revenues come in but have it paid over all income levels, thereby reducing the burden for anybody under the upper cutoff for paying it.  However, the effects of this change in the CPI used means that the cuts will get bigger and bigger as time passes, meaning that those who will be most negatively impacted will not the evil baby boomers, but the current young when they finally retire, although since they think they will get nothing, presumably they will be grateful to get even a crust of dry bread.    </p>
<p>More egregious for RJS&#8217;s arguments, and where he really is just outright lying rather than merely stretching the truth is this matter of increasing the retirement age.  Nobody is talking about any further rounds of that happening anytime soon.  RJS poses as this defender of youth against his awful generation (he trumpets his baby boomerdom to supposedly give credibility to his regularly repeated nonsense), but in fact the baby boomers, or certainly at least the front end ones like me and him, will not be affected at all by these future increases in eligibility ages.  It will be the Gen Xers and the Millennials.  RJS is just lying through his teeth.  We old farts will not pay at all as a result of this change, but today&#8217;s youth will. </p>

<p>Republican &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; proposal</p>
<p>House republican leaders have sent <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/sites/speaker.house.gov/files/documents/letter_to_wh_121203.pdf">a letter to President Obama </a>with their &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; proposal, which the Republicans cast as a &#8220;fair middle ground&#8221; and a &#8220;balanced framework for averting the fiscal cliff.&#8221;  Id.  Republicans object that the administrative proposal has is unbalanced, because it has &#8220;four times as much tax revenue as spending cuts&#8221; (under a Republican claim that the Administration shouldn&#8217;t count already enacted spending cuts that were part of the Administration&#8217;s original proposal as part of the bargain).  And of course the Republicans don&#8217;t like the idea of any stimulus measures being included in the deal or the proposal to finally do away with our arcane and unnecessary debt ceiling mess, which invites games of chicken that have no point.  They claim that they are merely supporting the Bowles-Simpson plan, which of course they are not since they are refusing all tax rate increases.</p>
<p>The letter is written rather confusedly and is therefore somewhat ambiguous on exactly what it is offering as a concrete proposal.  One has to conclude that it isn&#8217;t a concrete proposal but actually merely puffery that restates the position that the GOP wants lots of entitlement cuts, no military cuts, and no tax rate increases (but might go along, maybe, with some unspecified &#8220;loophole eilmination&#8221; for the nonce).  It appears to propose the following:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>$900 billion in cuts to mandatory spending including Medicare and Medicaid spending over the next decade 
<ul>
<li>The Republican letter, of course, tries to assume the mantle of &#8220;preserving and protecting&#8221; social welfare programs even while they reach out to reduce, eliminate or privatize them, when it suggests that perhaps the Republicans will return to the Budget Resolution that offered a voucher plan for limiting Medicare benefits (and hoped to buy off current seniors and those nearing retirement by promising them benefits under the current program). The Republican proposal referred to claims to &#8220;reform&#8221; Medicaid by offering &#8220;flexibility&#8221; that cuts $800 billion from the program over 10 years!  Although admitting that the election makes pursuing those kinds of harsh reforms &#8220;counterproductive&#8221;, the Republican leaders promise to &#8220;continue to support and advance them.&#8221; </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$300 billion in cuts to other discretionary spending over the next decade </li>
<li>$200 billion in cuts to Social Security benefits (by revising the method of calculating cost of living increases, which would also apply to keep the tax brackets from rising as fast and for adjustments to government pensions) </li>
<li>$800 billion in new revenue&#8211;achieved through &#8220;pro-growth tax reform that closes special-interest loopholes and deductions while lowering rates&#8221; (but of course without mentioning just what loopholes and deductions would be removed).  The letter goes on to declare that the Republican leaders will not agree to higher tax rates, asserting that their position is to &#8220;protect small businesses and our economy&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s assess this so-called &#8220;proposal.&#8221; </p>
<p>Lowering rates is absurdity at this point:  no reasonable person should vote for a proposal to lower US tax rates even more than they already are.  Lowering rates while eliminating deductions or loopholes doesn&#8217;t work any better:  immediately after such a bill is passed, the lobbyists will be back on the floor.  First they&#8217;ll demand a temporary extension while markets &#8220;adjust&#8221; (mostly bulls..t).  Then they&#8217;ll demand that the temporary provision be made permanent to provide &#8220;certainty&#8221; to markets and businesses.  Then they&#8217;ll demand enhancement of the loophole to broaden it, since they say such provisions will incentivize job creation. Etc.  This is an old story that never plays out the way the lobbyists promise.  Congress shouldn&#8217;t fall for it again.  Because the next ploy will be&#8211;oh, let&#8217;s broaden the base by removing these new old loopholes and then we can lower rates even more.  The only thing that is likely to happen in this ploy is that the top rates go down for the wealthiest taxpayers, who pay less and less.</p>
<p>Cutting the various safety net programs is equally absurd.  Especially in a time of continuing difficulty, especially for vulnerable populations like the elderly, poor, laborers with inadequate pension and health care possibilities after retirement and other large groups in our population.  There is no reason to cave to the GOP&#8217;s forty-year campaign to reduce, privatize or eliminate social welfare programs:  let the gradual onset of taxes and sequesters take place in January, and then ask them to pass a tax cut to benefit those in the middle and lower-income groups.</p>
<p>The letter ends with an oxymoronic statement that essentially states that if the Obama administration will cave to these GOP demands, they are &#8220;ready and eager to begin discussions about how to stucture these reforms.&#8221;  They go on to suggest that President Obama has taken actions to &#8220;undermine good-fith effrorts to reach a reasonable and equitable agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s bunk, boys.  If the GOP is going to play this game this way, the administration should not attempt any kind of short-term resolution.  After the Bush tax cuts are repealed once and for all by operation of existing law as of January 1, it will be much easier to discuss what reasonable tax cuts should be enacted to protect the middle class rather than the wealth of corporate managers and owners.  And once there is a first start on the reduction of the military budget, we can move on to reduce it even more.  Action can be taken to stave off problems that would be caused by any of the provisions in early 2013.</p>

<p>Water, human rights and government failure</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1549570">a paper</a> on a human right to water several years ago,* in which I made the point (using data!) that laws supporting a human right to water are unlikely to work in countries where the rule of law is weak.**    <br />But what about places where the rule of law means something? What about in California, where Governor Brown <a href="http://www.inlandvalleynews.com/2012/09/26/ca-governor-brown-signs-human-right-to-water/">just signed AB 685</a> into law? AB 685 was drafted into law as a &#8220;do something&#8221; response to the problems to the poor quality water that communities in the southern Central Valley were facing. These communities &#8212; mostly poor, mostly migrant &#8212; are in the middle of California&#8217;s &#8220;industrial ag&#8221; belt, and their groundwater was contaminated by runoff/seepage from cowshit generated at large-scale dairies (Happy cows! California #1!) and from excess pesticide/fertilizer applied at big farms.***<br />     <br />Although AB 685 sounds good, it actually does nothing concrete. It merely espouses a nice idea that will only be implemented if convenient. Here, in fact, is <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/asm/ab_0651-0700/ab_685_bill_20120925_chaptered.pdf">the entire addition to the State&#8217;s water code</a> [pdf]:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>SECTION 1. Section 106.3 is added to the Water Code, to read:   <br />106.3. (a) It is hereby declared to be the established policy of the state that every human being has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes.    <br />(b) All relevant state agencies, including the department, the state board, and the State Department of Public Health, shall consider this state policy when revising, adopting, or establishing policies, regulations, and grant criteria when those policies, regulations, and criteria are pertinent to the uses of water described in this section.    <br />(c) This section does not expand any obligation of the state to provide water or to require the expenditure of additional resources to develop water infrastructure beyond the obligations that may exist pursuant to subdivision (b).    <br />(d) This section shall not apply to water supplies for new development.    <br />(e) The implementation of this section shall not infringe on the rights or responsibilities of any public water system.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although sections (a) and (b) sound good, sections (c-e) seem to create giant loopholes (I still cannot understand what &#8220;beyond the obligations that may exist pursuant to subdivision (b)&#8221; means).  <br />So, I see this bill as a non-solution to a problem that needs to be addressed by:  
<ul>
<li>Reducing pollution from agriculture; and </li>
<li>Requiring farmers whose pollution has damaged groundwater to pay for substitute water supplies to communities with &#8220;impaired&#8221; water supplies or pay for the relocation of the people in those communities (polluter pays). </li>
</ul>
<p>Without a doubt, this ridiculous bill is a failure because it shifts the costs of a problem caused by agriculture onto public water agencies, giving us yet another example of how farmers representing less than 3 percent of California&#8217;s population, economy and workforce screw over the other 97 percent of Californians.****   <br />So, that&#8217;s the most recent development in the ongoing, worthless &#8220;discourses&#8221; in water policy &#8212; a human right to water &#8212; and another example of how politicians <strike>totally screw up policy</strike> present empty promises as &#8220;solutions.&#8221;<br />    <br />If you&#8217;re interested in hearing more of my thoughts on this topic, challenging those thoughts, or adding your own ideas and impressions, then tune into tomorrow&#8217;s webinar on Chapter 11 of <a href="http://endofabundance.com/">my book</a> (A human right to water), <a href="http://meet15266574.adobeconnect.com/chapter11/">here</a> at 9am Pacific (<a href="http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_US-CA.aspx?y=2012&#038;mo=10&#038;d=12&#038;h=9&#038;mn=0">get the time in your location</a> and <a href="http://meet15266574.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm">test your Flash installation</a>).    <br />Bottom Line: Words are nice, but deeds matter. The easiest way to get deeds is to create an incentive to act, and fine words from activists to politicians are hollow unless those politicians (and their bureaucratic minions) must deliver results.</p>
<hr>* I submitted the paper to <i>Water Resources Management </i>in August 2011, but they failed to find referees for it after one year. I withdrew it last week. FAIL.    <br />** I go on to suggest that a <i>property right</i> in water is more likely to result in water service to the poor, since they will be able to convert their rights into money, and money DOES flow towards those who can pay.     <br />*** I asked a representative of one of those counties about the &#8220;cowshit plume&#8221; in groundwater about eight years ago. She changed the subject to their LEED-certified office building. They were either too afraid of or owned by dairy farmers.    <br />**** This pattern holds in many countries, with the noble exceptions of New Zealand and Australia.</p>

                                <p>Following up on my <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-fed-credibility-argument.html">last post</a>, I actually think that there are two possible explanations for the “Fed Credibility” argument’s wide deployment, both hinted at in Simon’s <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2012/12/how-to-try-and-get-more-inflation.html?showComment=1354610368299#c770299358255238094">response to my comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think <strong>the credibility argument is really about the underlying motives of the policymakers</strong>, rather than their abilities. However <strong>I also think that argument is overdone – it takes a few generations to forget the lessons of the past, and policymakers are still obsessed with the 1970s</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my words, two possibilites:</p>
<p><strong>1. It’s a smokescreen.</strong> Actual reason: Creditors <em>hate</em> (unexpected) inflation. One extra percentage point transfers <em>hundreds of billions of dollars</em> of buying power from creditors to debtors, annually. ‘Nuf to get a fellow’s attention. The Fed is run by creditors.</p>
<p><strong>2. (70s) They actually are worried</strong> — that the higher inflation target <em>won’t work</em> in goosing the economy or employment, so they’ll run into a stagflation situation where stomping on (spiraling?) inflation is…problematic. So they won’t be able to fulfill the second half of their promise without causing a job recession a la Volcker. Rock and a hard place.</p>

                                <p>For once a short post, inspired by <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2012/12/how-to-try-and-get-more-inflation.html">Simon Wren’s suggestion</a> that the Fed should allow (encourage) a temporary rise in wage inflation. (The merits of such a policy being obvious to many of us given the current virtues of some extra inflation, and past decades’ wage trends.)</p>
<p>I’ve never understood the credibility danger of the Fed announcing and executing a temporary increase in the inflation target.</p>
<p>If the Fed said “we’re going to let (wage) inflation float a bit higher until the economy’s moving strongly back up toward capacity, then we’ll bring it back down,” and then did exactly that, wouldn’t that greatly <em>enhance</em> its reputation for being able to control inflation?</p>

                                <div>I have just learned of a new book that I believe every AB reader could relate to.</div>
<div><u><a href="http://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/publicaffairsbooks-cgi-bin/display?book=9781610391771" target="_blank">DON&#8217;T BUY IT:</a> The Trouble with Talking Nonsense about the Economy</u></div>
<p>by: ANAT SHENKER-OSORIO</p>
<p>An excerpt from the book summary: 
<div></div>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>This concise, entertaining book shows us how wrong-headed metaphors and deceptive language have muddled our economic thinking, and how better word choice alone can win the debate</div>
<div></div>
<div>Today the term &#8220;dismal science&#8221; seems almost too kind: too many of today&#8217;s economic arguments deserve the mantle of mysticism.  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Below are a few quotes from a an <a href="http://www.alternet.org/economy/learn-everything-you-need-know-about-economy-south-park-episode?page=0%2C0" target="_blank">excerpt of the preface </a>of the book.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Mainline thinking about the U.S. economy is starting to resemble Scientology: beyond a coterie of high-profile, high-income believers, the more those of us outside the fold learn about the teachings, the wackier the whole enterprise sounds.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Members who attempt to leave either orthodoxy—in one case a church and in the other a market-worship orientation—are shunned and ostracized.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>In a nutshell, the overriding message is twofold: it’s your fault that the Economy sucks, but there’s not much you can do to improve it. This storyline must sound achingly familiar to Christians. The blame for damnation to hell lies with you and you alone. Yet though prayer and piety are good ideas, only God determines who merits redemption. Economic salvation is out of your hands, but that’s no excuse to quit your night job or start spending on luxury items like college.  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I find this next statement most inline with my thinking when for years here at AB I have asked: What do we have an economy for?</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>In most domains, policies must be advertised as serving our national interests, but when GDP talk rolls around, this is no longer the case. We’re here to please the economy, not the other way around.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;ll send this one to my daughter to add to my “gift list”.  It&#8217;s a list of books she can consider when she wants to give me a gift.</div>

                                <p>In response to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/small-businesses-tax-cuts-and-reporting.html" target="_blank">Small businesses and tax cuts and reporting</a> by Daniel Becker, reader Betty, a long time small business owner and not a sole proprietor herself in one of the richer towns of MA with a median income over $180,000 , asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; I&#8217;ve always been baffled by the Republican complaint that it would be bad for the BUSINESSES of small business owners with incomes over $250,000 to be lumped with the Rich and have their taxes go up, or not go down, if the Bush tax cuts were not extended for the wealthy.  What I don&#8217;t get is this:  Even if the business earns millions, all business expenses are deductible. What&#8217;s left that&#8217;s taxable (the profit)  is the PERSONAL INCOME of the owner or owners, right?  So how does a higher tax adversely affect the business? Or are these large small businesses just corporations in disguise?</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Dan Becker</i> replied to Betty in two excellent posts from the past:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>I posted back in July of 2008 specifically addressing the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/07/myth-of-argument-is-in-conflation.html" target="_blank">conflation of income and business taxes</a> as Betty is noting.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, too many business people don&#8217;t get it either as I found after having a heated discussion with one of my colleagues.  He insisted I must not be incorporated because I did not know what I was talking about.<br />At the time I posted it, a couple others at AB commented that I was making the issue too complicated and that the average reader did not need to know such details.  Here we are 2012 discussing it again.  We can not expect to solve our problems is we are going to avoid deeper understanding of the words we use and the concepts those word represent.<br />I suggest my posting on the 1936 tax tables is another one of those postings that not enough people have read.  To many people really have little to no idea <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/03/defining-rich-vi-1936-tax-tables.html" target="_blank">just what is being talked about when someone says &#8220;income tax&#8221; or &#8220;marginal rates&#8221;</a><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/03/defining-rich-vi-1936-tax-tables.html" target="_blank">. </a></p></blockquote>
<p>(Dan C here&#8230;The small businesses many people, in my estimation, generally associate the term &#8216;small business&#8217; are probably &#8216;companies&#8217; under 50 employees but with a variety of legal and IRS oriented classifications.  I may post updated versions of these posts&#8230;people tend to approach taxes with more religious fervor than understanding).</p>

<p>NYT: $80 Billion in State and Local Subsidies Annually (Updated)</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s <i>New York Times</i>, Louise Story <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/us/how-local-taxpayers-bankroll-corporations.html?emc=na&#038;_r=0">begins a series</a>, &#8220;The United States of Subsidies,&#8221; ten months in the making, with a story focusing on General Motors closures, the border war for investments between Kansas and Missouri in the Kansas City metropolitan area, and a new estimate of state and local incentives to business, $80 billion a year. Backing this up, and no doubt contributing to the long lead time, is a database of 150,000 state and local subsidy deals going back at least 20 years. Given its appearance in the country&#8217;s newspaper of record, the series is sure to elevate the issue of state and local subsidies to a prominence it has never known before.    </p>
<p>Since <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/investmentincentivesandtheglobalcompetitionforcapital/KennethPThomas">my 2011 estimate</a> was $70 billion per year in total subsidies to business, and $46.8 billion in location incentives, the <i>Times</i> figure represents a substantial increase if accurate. Ever since <a href="http://www.tax.com/taxcom/taxblog.nsf/Permalink/UBEN-8CSNLH">David Cay Johnston </a>reviewed my book when it first came out, he has argued that my $70 billion figure was probably an underestimate, and the new report would seem to back him up. Nevertheless, I will certainly be spending some time analyzing the database to see just what is in it. According to the story, $18 billion per year is accounted for by corporate income tax breaks, a whopping $52 billion by &#8220;sales tax relief,&#8221; and the other $10 billion unspecified but most likely property tax breaks. I have some questions about these numbers, however.\</p>
<p>First, it seems to me that property tax breaks likely exceed $10 billion a year. When <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/02/california-birthplace-of-tif-axes-it.html">California axed tax increment financing</a> earlier this year, it was generating $8 billion in tax increment all by itself. Although California cities were by far the biggest user of TIF, municipalities in almost every other state still use it, as well as myriads of property tax abatements offered at the local level. Story is well aware of this. She writes:<br />
<blockquote>The cost of the awards is certainly far higher. A full accounting, The Times discovered, is not possible because the incentives are granted by thousands of government agencies and officials, and many do not know the value of all their awards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thousands of local governments give subsidies, and these are overwhelmingly related to property tax. In my most recent estimate, <strike>there were several states</strike> in <u>Missouri</u><strike>which</strike> local subsidies exceeded state subsidies, <strike>including Missouri and Michigan</strike>, so my default assumption was that they were equal if I did not have adequate information on local incentives, as is usually the case due to the huge number of governments involved.   </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, there is some chance that the $52 billion in sales tax subsidies could be an overestimate; it all depends on what <i>The Times</i> includes in this category. My own thinking about sales tax has changed since I first created the subsidy estimates in <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Competing_for_Capital.html?id=cEt3Vn3H6sUC">my 2000 book</a>, <i>Competing for Capital</i>. My estimate for Minnesota, for example, included many hundreds of millions per year in sales tax exemptions for business services. Now, I tend to think of these tax breaks as methods to avoid tax cascading (paying the sales tax on a good more than once, by taxing the full value of every intermediate good) and not a subsidy at all. They have been removed from my estimate of total subsidies in my more recent work, which did not prevent my estimate for 2005 (published in 2011) from being $20 billion higher than that for 1995 (published in 2000). I do still count some sales tax breaks as subsidies, particularly those on plant and equipment, which apply to the initial investment rather than ongoing operations.  </p>
<p>While this may seem like a sterile academic argument, in fact it makes a big difference whether incentives are $50 billion a year or $80 billion a year, approximately 600,000 public sector jobs paying $50,000 annually. The larger the true figure, the more pressing is the case for subsidy reform. The inauguration of this new series of articles, plus the database, will help us put a better number on the value, a critical first step toward galvanizing public opinion to force politicians to rein in subsidies.  </p>
<p>I will be commenting more on this series over the course of this week.  </p>
<p>UPDATE: Text corrected to reflect that although I had specific data for local incentives in Michigan, the total of local incentives was somewhat lower than that of state incentives. In addition, it is clearly true that TIF in California exceeded state subsidies, so obviously so did the total of local subsidies. However, I did not know this at the time I made the estimate.  </p>

                                <p>by David Zetland from <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/11/the-land-grabbers-review.html" title="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/11/the-land-grabbers-review.html">Aguanomics</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/11/the-land-grabbers-review.html">The Land Grabbers &#8212; the review</a></p>
<p> Fred Pearce sent me a review copy of his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Land-Grabbers-Fight-Earth/dp/0807003247"><i>The Land Grabbers: The New Fight over Who Owns the Earth</i></a>, which I enjoyed very much for its detailed description of the pros and cons resulting from foreigners investing in land in developing countries.</p>
<p>In the book, Pearce appears to see more cons with land deals than I do. Perhaps that&#8217;s because he saw only bad land deals, or perhaps he associates ALL large-scale agriculture with exploitation, inefficiency and environmental degradation. Any of you who read my paper (&#8220;The Political Economy of Land and Water Grabs&#8221;)* will know that I am annoyed that we do not have a good definition of when a land deal is a &#8220;bad&#8221; grab or &#8220;good&#8221; foreign direct investment (FDI). Pearce appears to call ALL deals grabs, but I think there are many well-run, sustainable farming operations that produce profits for the farmer, good jobs for locals, and quality food for markets.    </p>
<p>Anyway, here are my notes on the 300pp+ book, which has six parts and 27 chapters covering &#8220;grabs&#8221; from buy-side and sell-side locations in Europe, N and S America, Africa and SE Asia.
<ul>
<li>Many grabs convert &#8220;fallow&#8221; land to industrial-scale agriculture, but local communities often &#8220;cultivate&#8221; this land in long rotations of crops, grazing and recovery. Their methods are not just sustainable; they are cheaper and more productive for meeting a diverse range of local needs. Nomadic herders have practiced sustainable land management for centuries.</li>
<li>Such methods are also egalitarian. Poor farmers can eat, but poor urban residents will suffer from political corruption and/or favoritism.</li>
</ul>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<ul>
<li>That said, Pearce seems over-suspicious of markets (and financial instruments) that can improve food security and supply, views that I recently called <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/11/capitalism-growth-steady-state-and.html">shortsighted</a> and <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/10/its-not-as-simple-as-selling-books.html">misleading</a>.</li>
<li>Food security, for example, is often used as an excuse for protectionism that favors local food growers over consumers. Grabs directed at security also fuel &#8220;countervailing&#8221; grabs in which market supplies are replaced by managed supplies that will waste calories, inputs and environmental flows. Yes, the Saudis are engaging in grabs, but that was only after their failure to grow wheat at home (a bad idea that wasted water) and their exposure to volatile food markets. The trouble with their &#8220;grab&#8221; strategy is that they will not be able to export food if large-scale shortages arise and their &#8220;indigenous&#8221; farms are wasting water now that they will need in the future. It&#8217;s far more efficient, for example, to rely on markets for supplies, store a year&#8217;s supply of grain in case of market failure, and save water for cultivation should market interruptions last longer than a year.</li>
<li>Land grabs are also often water grabs. The weak property rights that allow land grabs (by definition, a grab takes land from other users) are almost surely accompanied by even weaker rights over water and even greater misuse of that water.</li>
<li>Grabs, as a business strategy, often depend on corrupt dictators who will not be around as long as the 50-99 year contracts may promise, making it difficult to invest over the long term or care about sustainability.</li>
<li>Even worse, most grabs are arranged in distant bureaus, where &#8220;buyers&#8221; and &#8220;sellers&#8221; may not have a clear idea of what they&#8217;ve agreed, let alone who else may be interested/affected by their agreement.</li>
<li>It seems that Pearce considers deals involving foreigners to be &#8220;bad&#8221; while deals with locals are &#8220;good,&#8221; but local thieves are not just more common, but more thorough, since they know the maximum local tolerance for greed. </li>
<li>That said, it&#8217;s great to improve local productivity. It just takes a lot longer because locals do not just &#8220;copy/paste&#8221; good ideas from other areas. The upside is that locals who develop &#8220;organically&#8221; will have diversified, robust systems that will contribute to market stability. Pearce would agree with this assessment, I am sure, but local is not the ONLY way to go&#8230;</li>
<li>Remember remember remember that foreigners cannot just show up and exploit (at least not in these post-colonial days) &#8212; they need corrupt local partners, and THOSE people are the ones with power to make or break a deal (as I discussed in my paper).</li>
<li>Unsustainable operations are a bigger problem than grabs. They are fueled by a combination of short-term thinking (high discount rate) that may be fed by over-capitalization (need to generate cash to pay off debt), poor property rights (get money before land is gone), tragedies of the commons (get water before neighbors take it), etc. These problems occur in ALL countries, but they can be minimized by stable, sensible policies.</li>
<li>Land grabbers may be taking &#8220;marginal&#8221; land (often conservation areas, etc.) but only because domestic farmers have already taken prime land, often before environmental perspectives had any weight.</li>
<li>Pearce appears to laud reverse grabs, e.g., when Chavez or Mugabe break large farms into smaller holdings, but those &#8220;fair&#8221; actions are often driven by corruption or revenge. Even worse, the land often ends up with cronies who cannot farm instead of poor farmers who can. </li>
<li>Remember that there would be NO land grabs if individuals or communities had title to their land! That&#8217;s why many grabs are occurring in Africa &#8212; about 80 percent of the land there is &#8220;managed&#8221; using informal, communal methods.</li>
<li>Pearce also covers the interesting case of &#8220;green grabs&#8221; &#8212; where environmentalists take land out of production (or protect it), to keep it pristine. These grabs sometimes exclude locals from their traditional lands; they can also be sustainable (e.g., locals live in the lands under traditional conditions, while earning money from fees paid by foreign tourists who want to hunt beasts with cameras or guns).</li>
<li>Pearce loses his way when discussing &#8220;grabs&#8221; in Australia that are really FDI. That&#8217;s not the case in Cambodia, where corruption underpins land seizures, but it&#8217;s not good to mix up fair deals (even if they upset nationalists who prefer to avoid competing with foreigners for land) with theft.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s an interesting discussion of grabs in Malaysia and Indonesia, in which rainforests are cut down for timber and palm oil plantations. It&#8217;s not just that these grabs impoverish locals of their traditional lands, or that the biofuels produced on the land may actually be &#8220;carbon positive&#8221; but that the wood products produced from them are certified &#8220;good&#8221; by the FSC when they really are not. The main point is that eco-labels are meaningless unless there&#8217;s a 100 percent accurate way to prevent counterfeits &#8212; and that&#8217;s hard in corrupt countries.</li>
<li>Take this last point with my point on property rights and long term views above, and you will see how real sustainability results from accurate pricing of resources that belong to a community over the long term (50+ years).</li>
<li>The world&#8217;s largest sugar farm in Sudan uses 2.4mafy (~3,000 GL), or 4 percent of the Nile&#8217;s flow!</li>
<li>Water grabs, no surprise, reduce environmental flows that nourish wetlands that traditional users depend on for food, fiber and fish. No rights = hunger.</li>
<li>Mega farms may be unsustainable, but subsistence farms cannot generate enough production. Perhaps the middle way &#8212; small-scale, mixed-use farms managed by owner/entrepreneurs who innovate and adapt to local conditions &#8212; are the best way to feed the world over the long run. Oh, and don&#8217;t forget that these guys need to trade and benefit from trade. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom Line: I give this book FOUR STARS for its vivid description of the problems related to land grabs that benefit outsiders at a cost to locals whose land is taken from them. Read it to understand the choices between hunger and food, rebellion and stability but don&#8217;t forget that property rights (legal, traditional or communal) would stop unfair grabs while allowing local people to benefit from their resources, locally and globally.    <br />

<p>Raising the Price of Pizza 10 to 14 cents. . .</p>
<p> Will pizza and food prices really have to increase to cover healthcare costs for the mostly young employees of the Olive Garden&#8217;s, Denny&#8217;s, and Papa John&#8217;s restaurants? </p>
<p>A 10 to 14 cents increase per pizza is being proposed by Papa Johns&#8217; to pay for the PPACA. At the same time, Papa John&#8217;s is advertising a 2 million-pizza giveaway with the help of Peyton Manning <a href="file:///C:/Users/Owner/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/XVMSONN6/#_top"><i>&#8220;Two Million Free Pizzas&#8221;</i></a> (must be a freebie?). Not sure myself how I might decide to account for the cost; but, here is a try; free pizza for 2 million NFL fans to increase sales, . . . cut employee hours to avoid the PPACA and keep the price, . . . raise prices 10 to 14 cents per pizza to have healthcare insurance for the restaurant staff, . . . or maybe a kind of half cheese/half sausage combo. . . healthcare and free pizzas with Peyton Manning promoting the social responsibility of Papa John&#8217;s? </p>
<p>Maggie Mahar at The Health Beat Blog <a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/11/can-u-s-businesses-afford-obamacare-2/"><i>&#8220;Can US Businesses Afford Obamacare?&#8221;</i></a> points to an interesting article by John Padua of <i>Managed Care Matters </i>discussing who bears the healthcare reform cost if restaurant owners opt out<i> </i>while Forbes Caleb Melby runs the numbers and questions the increased costs suggested by Papa&#8217;s John&#8217;s CEO<i> </i><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/calebmelby/2012/11/12/breaking-down-centi-millionaire-papa-john-schnatters-obamacare-math/"><i>&#8220;Papa John&#8217;s Obamacare Math&#8221;</i></a><i> .</i><br /><i><br /></i> The issue(s): <i>The Affordable Care Act dictates that full-time employees (30 hours or more per week) at companies with more than 50 workers need to be provided health insurance. CEO John Schnatter has further claimed that some employers will cut employee hours to avoid providing them with healthcare. </i><br /><i></i><br />The Cost: <i>John Schnatter estimates that Obamacare will end up costing his company $5-8 million annually.</i><br /><i></i><br />The Price Increase: <i>10 to 14 cents per pizza</i><br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>Checking John Schnatter’s Math: </strong><i>Last year, Papa John’s International captured $1.218 billion in revenue. Total operating expenses were $1.131 billion. If Schnatter’s math is accurate (Obamacare will cost his company $5-8 million more annually), then new regulation translates into a .4% to .7% expense increase. It is difficult to set that ratio against the proposed pie increase and across all sizes given size and topping differentials, but many of their large specialty pizzas run for $16. Remarkably, a 10-14 cent increase on a $16 pizza falls in a comparable range of .6% to .9%; but, the cost transference becomes less equitable if you are looking at medium pizzas which run closer to $12, meaning a .8% to 1.15% price increase.</i><br /><i><br /></i> <i>Lets say that Papa John’s sells exactly half medium/half large specialty pizzas. Averaging the ranges for both sizes, then averaging that product yields a .86% price increase — well outside the range of what Schnatter says Obamacare will cost him.</i><br /><i><br /></i> <i>So how much would prices go up, under these 50/50 conditions, if they were to fairly reflect the increased cost of doing business onset by Obamacare? Roughly 3.4 to 4.6 cents a pie.</i><br /><i></i></p>
<p>3.4 to 4.6 cents does not seem like such a huge increase to bear by either customer or the business and if the advertising is done right; it might prove more positive than giving away 2 million freebie pizzas during the NFL season . . . a little like Schooner Tuna in the movie &#8220;<i>Mr. Mom,</i>&#8216;<i>we are in this together for the long haul.'&#8221;</i> What customer would not buy into this?</p>
<p>The Issue(s): From the annals of I made this;<i> &#8220;Everyone is looking for a way &#8216;</i>not<i>&#8216; to provide insurance for their employees. It is essentially a huge tax on all us business people,&#8221; </i>declares <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/11/15/1197431/dennys-obamacare/?mobile=nc"><i>Denny&#8217;s RREMC Franchise Owner CEO John Metz</i></a><i> </i>on Fox News. To offset costs further, John adds; &#8220;<strong><i>he also will slash most of the </i></strong><strong><i>staff’s time to fewer than 30 hours per week</i></strong>&#8221; to start January 2014.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Talk about giving a long notice for plant closures to employees. What happens if franchise owner sidesteps the insurance provision of the PPACA and cuts hours to fewer than 30? John Padua of <i>Managed Care Matters </i>says the cost falls back on the US citizenry, employees, and customers of these restaurants. </p>
<p><strong>&#8220;<i>If companies do not provide insurance for low-paid workers, we taxpayers have to.</i></strong><i> That is the way Obamacare works; folks with incomes below 400% of the FPL can get subsidized coverage. If restaurants cut workers’ hours so as not to insure employees, all of us taxpayers get to pay for their health insurance. These companies are avoiding their responsibility and increasing our tax burden. </i><i><a href="http://www.joepaduda.com/2012/11/the-cost-obamacare-14-cents-per-pizza/">&#8220;The Cost of Obamacare -14 cents per pizza&#8221;</a></i><i></i></p>
<p>The Cost: Maggie Mahar raises the question in her <i>&#8220;Can They Afford It???&#8221;</i> post. Metz employs 1,200 associates at his Denny&#8217;s RREMC franchise. Taking the extreme case of all 1200 employees going into the state exchange and being subsidized up to 400% of FPL; by slashing everyone&#8217;s hours to 28, Metz avoids the $2,000 penalty (~$2.34 million in total) for those going into the state exchange.</p>
<p>The Price Increase: 5% surcharge to all meals in 40 Denny&#8217;s in Georgia, Florida and Virginia. (note: I wonder how that will appear on the bill?)</p>
<p>Checking The Math: The CBO (which forever appears to be anti-healthcare reform) found in a recent study, 2014 comprehensive healthcare insurance could be had at $3,400 for an employee up to 30 years of age and single. Understanding we are not talking about writing off Metz&#8217;s employee expenses from his corporate income tax yet and knowing the PPACA requires an employer to pay 65% of the employee&#8217;s healthcare insurance, the $3,400 per person (down from a projected $6,700 without the PPACA) now becomes $2,210 per person. </p>
<p>Denny&#8217;s franchise owner Metz is angry with Obama, the PPACA, and his employees. Granted, the example is as much an extreme as Metz&#8217;s knee jerk reactions and posturing; but, it points to the overall fallacy in the too-much-healthcare- cost is a drag on my business argument. Both of these entrepreneurs did take grief for their stances. Denny&#8217;s CEO John Miller did call john Metz to discuss his stance and John Schnatter has been called out in various blogs and is the subject of multiple boycotts.</p>
<p>Much of this sounds like sour grapes starting with SCOTUS affirming the PPACA and is carryover from the re-election of Barack Obama to the Presidency. Some have protested the validity of the PPACA claiming it was immoral to force business owners to pay for employee healthcare insurance. In an email exchange, John Paduca answers:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In response to your query as to when it became an employers’ responsibility to provide health insurance, that would have occurred when PPACA was passed, signed into law, and upheld by the Supreme Court. Laws run this country, not morals. If &#8216;morals&#8217; did, we never would have invaded Iraq or water-boarded prisoners or interned Japanese Americans or overturned legitimate governments in Africa and Central America or supported the Shah of Iran. &#8216;Morals&#8217; are personal; laws are societal.&#8221;</i><br /><i><br /></i> Maybe it is just Republicans having to cancel their airline tickets to Boston for the celebration on November 7th which has placed both Johns in a bad mood. Or could it be pent up anger with the very people who elected Barack to The White House for a second term? You know, those 47 percenters who might make up the bulk of the restaurant workers. </p>
