                                <p>With respect to the Pauslon plan, Calculated Risk offers <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/09/paulson-plan-will-it-work.html">this analysis</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The primary goal of the Paulson Plan is to get the banks to lend again &#8211; or &#8220;unclog the system&#8221; as Secretary Paulson put it. Secondary goals are to &#8220;protect the taxpayer&#8221; and hopefully minimize moral hazard.</p>
<p><strong>Will the plan achieve the primary goal? I think the answer is yes.</strong> By removing these troubled assets from the balance sheets of the financial institutions, the banks will able to lend again without lingering doubts about their solvency and viability. At first glance, the size of the plan seems sufficient.</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s getting some flak in comments from some people suggesting that he&#8217;s acting like a shill for the finance industry. (Of course, they&#8217;re conviently overlooking the part where CR says &#8220;the plan does nothing to protect taxpayers or minimize moral hazard.&#8221;) But the thing is, he&#8217;s probably right. This plan probably will unclog the pipes of the financial system and get the banks back to lending like it&#8217;s 2004. But it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p>Let me pose an analogy. Let&#8217;s say I buy and sell Beanie Babies. I sit in front gift shops early in the morning, waiting for them to open so I can be first to snatch up the little critters. I have a buddy who works at Halmark who gives me good deal on the most coveted bears. I turn around and sell them for 100% markup, and they sell like hotcakes. I&#8217;m making hand over fist.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m making so much money that I don&#8217;t know what to do with it. I start to lend some of my money out to my classmates so they can buy snacks during study hall. They pay me back the next day, but with a little fee tacked on. I&#8217;m making more money. Yea me.</p>
<p>But then people figure out that Beanie Babies are just pieces of cloth stuffed with plastic beads and cheap cotton. Prices plummet. I&#8217;ve placed all the ads in several different Beanie Baby magazines, and no one is calling. I sunk all my funds into a big lot of the fancy bears to celebrate the death of Princess Di, thinking I could just keep selling them for twice as much I paid. But no one&#8217;s willing to pay what I paid, let alone my asking price. No one&#8217;s buying them, period.</p>
<p>So what should happen at this point? I made a bad bet, thinking that in this new economy every household will want their own collection of precious little beanies. But it was all a fad, a bubble.</p>
<p>Typically one might expect that my new collection of Princess Di Beanie Babies, now worth nothing more than the material they are made from, would be turned into chew toys for my dog. But here&#8217;s the rub; how are my classmates going to buy snacks during study hall? I don&#8217;t have any money to lend; I blew it all on worthless beanie babies.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the Fed steps in. We can&#8217;t have a frozen banking system! Who will buy snacks, even if they have to incur a little debt to get some? So they buy the Beanie Babies from me. Maybe not at my initial asking price, but certainly a lot more than what they&#8217;re worth. I offload the bean bags to them, and they fork over the cash. I&#8217;m back in business! Now I have money to lend to my buddies. Yea me again. What to do the excess cash now? Hmmm&#8230; I heard Pokemon cards were selling well&#8230;</p>
<p>CR&#8217;s right; if we give the banking industry $700 billion in exchange for their big stupid pile of Beanie Babies, they will have money to lend. And we will have Beanie Babies. Yea us.</p>

                                <p>At a high level, <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/and-then-there-were-two/">Floyd Norris explains it all to you</a>.</p>
<p>UDATED, AND PULLED TO THE FORE: For the more detailed view (h/t <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/09/regulatory-exem.html">Barry R.</a>), the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/nyregion/22sun.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print">soon to be late</a>, <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/010545.html">not very lamented</a>, New York Sun <a href="http://www.nysun.com/business/ex-sec-official-blames-agency-for-blow-up/86130/?print=5279202221">presents the details</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The SEC allowed five firms — the three that have collapsed plus Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — to more than double the leverage they were allowed to keep on their balance sheets and remove discounts that had been applied to the assets they had been required to keep to protect them from defaults.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, according to Mr. Pickard, who helped write the original rule in 1975 as director of the SEC&#8217;s trading and markets division, is a move by the SEC this month to further erode the restraints on surviving broker-dealers by withdrawing requirements that they maintain a certain level of rating from the ratings agencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>and the solution <strong>going forward</strong> (that is, after you give these guys $700 billion) will be an even weaker form:<br />
<blockquote>The SEC said it has no plans to re-examine the impact of the 2004 changes to the net capital rule, and last week, it put out a proposal to revise the rule once again. This time, it is looking to remove the requirement that broker dealers maintain a certain rating from the ratings agencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because nothing says &#8220;faith in the institution&#8221; like a non-investment grade rating.</p>
<p>*Title explanation: Mother Courage at the beginning of the play has two (2) children.  By the end, she has two less than that.  The play closes with her &#8220;silent scream&#8221; as she drags her cart along.</p>
<p>If you had only seen that final scene, you would think it is a tragedy <em>of</em> Mother Courage, not one caused by her. Working from memory: One of her children dies because she sends him(?) something that might be salable—in the middle of a battlefield.  The other is similarly sacrificed.  It is the reverse of the &#8220;because he&#8217;s an orphan&#8221; joke.</p>

<blockquote><p>There are about 2 months until the election, an election that will decide the next President of the United States    The person elected will be the president of all Americans, not just the Democrats or the Republicans.</p>
<p>To show our solidarity as Americans, let&#8217;s all get together and show each other our support for the candidate of our choice.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time that we all came together, Democrats and Republicans alike.</p>
<p>If you support the policies and character of Barak Obama, please drive with your headlights on during the day.</p>
<p>If you support McCain, please drive with your headlights off at night.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></blockquote>

<p>We’ve created the most comprehensive page of information on vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on the Internet &#8211; <br /><a href="http://dailysource.org/palin">Daily Source</a> on the Vice Presidential candidate.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since Gov. Palin is new to just about everyone in the country, little is known about her record and her policies. Our special section has in-depth research, videos, audio clips, excerpts and links to hundreds of articles, including many from newspapers and TV stations in Alaska. </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://dailysource.org/about/team">About the team</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The level of research is unparalleled, and the page is updated regularly. Our site’s editors and volunteers include an Emmy-award winning CNN reporter, the former operating editor of the Christian Science Monitor’s Web site, the former head of NPR’s News Blog and the Executive Director of the Online News Association &#8211;</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I stress again that I am technically an economist, but I have focused on everything except for money and banking (OK everything but money, banking and Neo-Austrian theory) so I am ignorant on this topic.</p>
<p>I am interested in understanding why financial innovation is profitable.  I can think of two key reasons for new instruments.  One is that they make risk diversification possible, the other is that they enable regulated entities to evade prudential regulations.  </p>
<p>I would tend to guess that the second is the more important.  </p>
<p>My thoughts on Credit default insurance.  <br />1) You can hedge against default on bonds by buying a diversified portfolio of bonds<br />2) Prudential regulations do not take account of this fact, but rather include restrictions on total assets as a function of capital and on the types of assets which entities can own.<br />3) Credit default insurance makes it legal for regulated entities to own bonds whose rating is low. <br />4) it is no more effective in avoiding risk than is plain diversification, because a nationwide crisis will bankrupt the insurer.  <br />5) it exists as a means of evading prudential regulation.</p>
<p>If I am right, the smart guys on Wall Street are similar to smart corporate lawyers who made their money by finding ways of evading regulation.  That lowers my opinion of them (I thought they were partly gambling and mostly fleecing individual fools who should blame themselves).</p>
<p>Thoughts on other innovations after the jump.</p>
<p>Does anyone else remember when money market funds were new ?  Anyone else vague on the difference between a money market fund and a money market account ?</p>
<p>Now I understand that the point is that, theoretically (and not just theoretically any more) the balance of a money market fund is a number of shares each of which is always (almost always now) worth exactly $1, but which does not have a guaranteed price. </p>
<p>Thus, it seems to me, the balances do not count as liquid liabilities of the banks (deposits) for the purposes of reserve requirements, and the assets (commercial paper IIRC) does not count as an asset of the bank.  Officially, the bank is just like a broker.</p>
<p>However, the instant that there is a significant risk of breaking the buck, the treasury <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080919/bs_nm/financial_bailout_dc">jumped in to protect them</a>.  </p>
<blockquote><p>The Treasury also said on Friday that it would siphon up to $50 billion from a fund established in the 1930s to conduct foreign exchange market intervention to backstop the rattled U.S. money market mutual fund industry.</p>
<p>This long-safe corner of financial markets, home to some $3.5 trillion of deposits, has increasingly appeared at risk of falling victim to the year-old credit crunch. Money market fund assets dropped by a record $169.03 billion in the week ended September 17 as jittery investors pulled money out.</p>
<p>The Treasury said it would back money market funds whose asset values fall below $1 a share. Separately, the Fed said it would lend money to banks to finance purchases of certain assets from money market funds</p></blockquote>
<p>This means that banks have avoided paying dues to the FDIC and relaxed capital and reserve requirements in exchange for &#8230; an empty threat, since money market funds are too big to fail.</p>
<p>What is the point of pooling pools of mortgage bonds and making new tranches ?  Much money was made by taking the middling seniority tranches of pools of mortgage bonds and reslicing them to make senior (AAA) tranches and equity tranches.  Was there really any more diversification to be done ?  Or was this a way to game the bond ratings ?  If the original pools were already well diversified, they would be almost perfectly correlated so all tranches of the pool of pools would be middling risky (mezzanine).  Were the original pools poorly designed or was the aim to get an AAA rating for a risky asset ?  Even assuming the bond rating agencies are honest, they must work according to rules.  I think it very likely that everyone knew that the senior tranches of pools of pools were risky (they paid higher than standard AAA rates) and that entities which weren&#8217;t allowed to buy risky bonds didn&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>That this was not a way of diversifying risk but a way to evade prudential regulations.</p>
<p>I suspect that financial innovators not only undermined the US financial system, but did it on purpose, creating instruments whose only role was to technically comply with prudential regulation while making a crisis inevitable sooner or later.</p>

                                <p>UPDATE:  <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/no-deal/">Krugman comes to the same conclusions, more concisely</a>.  (That&#8217;s why he gets paid the big bucks.)  And Brad DeLong has modified <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/understanding-t.html">his original position</a> to the point where <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/note-to-self-po.html">it&#8217;s got a good chance of working going forward</a>.</p>
<p>I started a &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/what-is-asset.html">What is an Asset</a>&#8221; post yesterday, which got sidetracked by Brad DeLong&#8217;s urging that the rewards for bad behavior be maintained while expecting a return to the &#8220;good&#8221; intertemporal equilibrium to be maintainable in the face of payoff-dominant strategies that, in his scenario, become equally risky and offer higher rewards.*</p>
<p>For those who want to see where the post would have gone, let us pull two comments from  AnonCC to the fore:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;There are only a few problems, key of which is the title of this piece. Derivatives may have a value, but are they actually assets? Worse, if the Fed buys an asset, does it also have to buy all of the associated derivative contracts, one side of which may—by that simple—become worthless or become payable?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is precisely what really scares me about Paulson&#8217;s description of the bailout plan. Hybrid and synthetic CDOs (which cover most CDOs issued from 2006 on) are definitely not assets! These monsters are insurance companies that will be seen to be severely underfunded when insurers like MBIA, Ambac and AIG fail to pay on their reinsurance policies. If Treasury buys these insurance obligations, it will become a financial insurer for subprime.</p>
<p>(I should add that there are cash CDOs that are not insurance companies and can be fairly considered as assets. So all CDOs cannot be grouped in the same category.)</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;re talking hundreds of billions paid up front for the privilege of providing this insurance, and trillions out the back door to hedge funds and the remaining investment banks over the next decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean Baker <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=09&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=questions_on_the_bush_bailout">takes  the question of the bailout to an even more elementary level</a>, having remembered that there is a market and therefore a &#8220;market value&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>The most obvious question: is how will paying market price for near worthless assets prevent the collapse of zombie institutions like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and AIG? These institutions needed money. They won&#8217;t get it from selling mortgage backed securities, that are chock full of bad mortgages, at the market price. We already know this, because they already had the option to do so.</p>
<p>The Bush proposal to throw out hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to buy up this debt will do little if anything to prevent another round of collapsing banks. We will again see desperate weekends with Treasury and Fed honchos running around trying to save the next major basket case.</p>
<p>The other big question is: how will we get the banks to honestly describe the assets they throw into the auction?</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless the Fed is planning to buy assets at <em>above</em> market value—that is, to directly subsidize those same bankers and firms with taxpayer dollars, with concomitantly to make those risky assets &#8220;less&#8221; risky in the market and still providing no route or incentive to return to the &#8220;good&#8221; equilibrium—the &#8220;bailout&#8221; as discussed with have no positive effect on the health of the firm(s).</p>
<p>So what Henry Paulson is proposing has to be a direct subsidy to have any effect.</p>
<p>As an isolated plan, it is a reward for bad behavior.  Only if it were combined with those items for which we &#8220;don&#8217;t have time&#8221;—say, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/09/recapitalizatio.html">the plan suggested by Mark Thoma</a>—could it possibly be an economically viable plan:<br />
<blockquote>First, in return for taking toxic assets off of a firms books at a price that is higher than the market rate, the government would get a share of any future profits the firm makes for some time period, say 10% for ten years, something like that. Administratively, it could come as an increased tax rate on profits and, if it helps politically, it could be earmarked for a particular cause. The government pays the firm a fair value for the assets plus an additional amount to help with recapitalization, and in return gets a claim on future profits for a period of time (I would also tie executive compensation directly to profits to help prevent gaming).</p></blockquote>
<p>*As a result of this, and some unfelicitous phrasing, I am now in DeLong Coventry.  I can live with that.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>First, there was the shotgun marriage of Bear Stearns and JPM. Then $85 billion to AIG. Next came the loans to shore up money markets. Finally Friday’s announcement of a special program (most of the important details still unknown) that will cost “hundreds of billions of dollars”.</p>
<p>And of course don’t forget the alphabet soup of special facilities created by the Fed to protect the big money movers.</p>
<p>Bailouts, all. A lot has already been said, of course. But there are two things that I wanted to add to the conversation.</p>
<p>First, folks on the left and the right have referred to the recent onslaught of government bailouts as “socialism”. On the surface, it may seem that way, given that government now “controls” vast swaths of the nation’s financial system. But nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Let me say it more plainly; this is not socialism. Socialism is a form of government that seeks to equalize the playing field for all, insuring that that the fruits of labor are shared equally (but not fairly, necessarily. That’s one of the major reasons why socialism doesn’t work). Does anyone seriously think that captains of finance have embraced the philosophy of “workers of the world, unite!”? The same guys with multi-million dollar “golden-parachutes”, sometimes taking home more than a billion dollars in a year. The same guys who have embraced shady accounting practices so that they and their companies pay as little in taxes as possible, sometimes percentages of income far less than the average American worker. The same guys who have broken union after union over the decades. We’re supposed to believe that just this week this crew has decided to abandon Friedman and embrace Marx with open arms? Come on…</p>
<p>Let’s look at it another way; does anyone seriously believe that the average American stands to benefit financially from the actions taken this week? That the profits of AIG, or BS, or Fannie and Freddie will be split equally amongst the masses? Of course not. Instead, tax payer money will flow from the Treasury to shore up the accounts of what should be insolvent corporations. Essentially out of your pocket and into the hands of Wall St, only making a quick pit stop in DC. Or worse, putting it on the national credit card by selling even more treasuries. This is not socialism. Instead, this more resembles a different form of societal structure: kleptocracy.</p>
<p>Second, how did we get to the point that simply the failure of one company would mean utter chaos for society at large? This fact alone illustrates very nicley that the financial system ceased to be a free market long before last week. The lifeblood of free markets is competition. Competition gives birth to fair pricing of goods and services as well as efficiency of commerce. If one business fails, another takes its place.</p>
<p>The fact that these corporations were to big to fail means they were too big. Period. If AIG couldn’t hack it, then some other corporation would have stepped up to the plate. That is if the market place was truly free. But clearly it was not. Instead, what existed was at the very least a pseudo-monopoly. Many markets left to themselves will gradually evolve into monopolies, and one of the roles government needs to play is to insure that monopolies don’t get to the point where they distort free markets to the point where they aren’t really free anymore. Obviously government failed to meet that obligation in the financial sector the last few years.</p>
<p>I suppose that’s what happens when the foxes are put in charge of the hen house. Only time will tell if the foxes can keep fooling everyone into believing that there are still some hens left.</p>
<p>Note: It should go without saying that the above is my opinion and my opinion alone. No doubt that many of the other Angry Bears would disagree with at least some parts, if not the whole. But I&#8217;ll say it anyway.</p>
