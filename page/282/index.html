<p>Congress seems incapable of setting aside electioneering rhetoric and talking straight about taxes and deficits. The GOP claims that it thinks deficits are bad things while at the same time it proposes no spending cuts (except to important safety net programs) and does propose further tax cuts.</p>
<p><em>Just a bit of background on tax cut rationales and deficits</em>.</p>
<p>Back in the old days of the Bush regime, the tax cutters tended to claim that tax cuts would create jobs and raise (not lower) government revenues. They didn&#8217;t. The Bush administration had anemic job growth, certainly seeing no boost from the humongous tax cuts enacted in 2001, 2003, and 2004 (and smaller cuts throughout the term). And we have enough experience with tax cut programs from Reagan to Bush I to Bush II to see that revenues do not miraculously go up when the taxing provisions that are intended to raise revenues are cut back. Sometimes there are a few localized effects&#8211;such as increased selling of capital stocks to take advantage of a new and lower rate because it is expected that higher rates will have to be enacted later. But tax cuts cut revenues.</p>
<p>Further, in spite of the GOP attempt to label the Dems as the tax-and-spend party, the GOP turned out to be the tax-cut-and spend-anyway party. Government grew under Bush, even while revenues shrank. The war in Iraq, for example, resulted in huge expansions of military and defense costs, and the homeland security apparatus, much of it intrusive of our private liberty and ineffective at dealing with terrorists, piled on additional government bureaucracy and costs.</p>
<p>If you cut revenues without finding appropriate government programs to cut, then you will increase government borrowing and increase government deficits.</p>
<p>Now, deficit increases make sense sometimes. When the economy is in a slump, it means that private spending is down, so government spending is needed to move it out of the slump. A deficit that is caused by increased government spending that helps the economy by restoring jobs and getting the economy moving again is a deficit that will be reduced as the economy grows, people with jobs pay taxes, and government spending that was used to supplement inadequate private spending can be cut back. Infrastructure spending provides that kind of a stimulus&#8211;building systems that will last for years now, to create jobs and stimulate the economy serves the public interest now and for the long term. See, e.g., Laurence Seidman, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bepress.com/ev/vol7/iss3/art2/?sending=11144">Reducing Future Deficits While Stimulating Today&#8217;s Economy</a>, 7 Economists&#8217; Voice Art. 2 (Sept. 2010).<br /><a name="more"></a><br />But the deficit created by the Bush tax cuts doesn&#8217;t make sense. It is based on &#8220;trickle down&#8221; economics&#8211;the view that if the rich get richer, everybody else will do well too. But that hasn&#8217;t been the case. Since 1980, the rich have gotten immensely richer, but most Americans have hit stagnation, with real wages not sharing at all in the productivity gains that have made corporate managers multimillionaires. The productivity gains, that is, have gone to the people at the top, and the people at the top have horded them, supporting tax policies that give themselves huge tax cuts.</p>
<p>Tax cuts&#8211;especially for the wealthiest people and corproations&#8211;do not make sense. That money is as likely to be invested overseas as in the US, and overseas it does nothing but contribute to the job drain. Corporations purchasing new equipment with the 100% expensing may buy that equipment from China or India or Korea&#8211;again, pushing jobs overseas and doing nothing to stimulate the local economy, but costing the government the tax expenditure that could have been used for public infrastructure projects instead.</p>
<p><em>And now to the current situation as the &#8220;Senate G.O.P. Digs In to Keep Tax Cuts&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The income tax provisions passed during the Bush regime were almost all temporary provisions&#8211;they were passed with a sunsetting provision so that they expire at the end of 2010, and the law as it was prior to the Bush administration retakes its place as the applicable law. The question now is whether new laws should be enacted along the same lines.</p>
<p>When the Bush cuts were enacted, the arguments were that tax cuts would lead to more revenues (they didn&#8217;t), that there was a surplus to return to the people (there wasn&#8217;t&#8211;by the time the GOP Congress enacted the 2001 tax cuts, there was already a deficit), and that the tax cuts would stimulate the economy so that it would grow really fast and create large numbers of new jobs (it didn&#8217;t&#8211;job growth was anemic).</p>
<p>Remember, folks, there was no huge public outcry for new tax cuts when the Bush regime passed the 2001 cuts. And the cuts were made temporary BECAUSE of the huge cost of extending them for more than ten years, which would have made the deficit creation impact too obvious. This was policy pushed by the right, not by the public. Does the fact that the teapartiers are now part of the anti-government, anti-tax hollering mean that people really want to retain the super-low taxes of the Bush period no matter what? I doubt it. Remember those teapartiers who want the government to stay away from their Medicare and Social Security? How about Center for Disease Control&#8211;would anyone want there to be no federal vaccine programs for highly contagious diseases? How about National Science Foundation&#8211;would people want basic scientific research to cease in the US, so that all our brightest young minds would go to China or India for education and work, leaving us with no innovation? How about emergency response funding&#8211;do we not want the Federal Government to be able to send people, supplies and support to Katrina-type events? What about keeping the food supply safe? the water supply? medicines? All of these things are &#8220;we the people&#8221; acting to do things that need to be done through the Federal Government.</p>
<p>John Boehner, the House Minority Leader and generally not a very astute person to trust with developing tax policy, had actually admitted to some rational thinking on the expiring Bush tax cuts last Sunday on Face the Nation. He acknowledged that he could support a new tax cut for the middle class, even if the wealthy didn&#8217;t get one. Daniel, <a target="_blank" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100912/ap_on_bi_ge/us_tax_cuts">Boehner says he&#8217;d support a middle-class tax cut</a>, YahooNews.com (Sept. 12, 2010). Of course, he resorted to the old &#8220;class warfare&#8221; attack&#8211;according to the GOP, anybody who doesn&#8217;t give a tax cut to the rich every time they give some kind of break to the poor is engaging in class warfare. </p>
<blockquote><p>Aside on &#8220;class warfare&#8221;: But of course, the GOP has supported numerous tax breaks that are primarily for the rich&#8211;or only available to the top 40% of taxpayers&#8211;and never admit that is class warfare. e.g., the deduction for home mortgage interest on mortgages up to a million dollars, which is available only to those who itemize &#8211;about 30% of taxpayers, and of those 30%, is of the most benefit to the richest minority who pay higher rates and thus get a larger deduction, or the exclusion for municipal bond interest, which is used by the wealthiest taxpayers who have most of the financial assets, etc. </p>
<p>Progressives would argue that class warfare is represented by the corporatist agenda that extracts all productivity gains for managers and owners and leaves workers without even the pension promises that were made when workers accepted lower wages for higher pension benefits, or the policies that make it extraordinarily hard for workers to form a union, which would give them some semblance of equality of bargaining power with the concentrated power of megalithic multinational corporations, or the &#8220;globalization&#8221; policies that lead to free trade agreements that impose no protections for our own workers or our environment, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>The reasonableness represented by Boehner&#8217;s concession lasted all of a microsecond. Boehner&#8217;s deputy, the House Republican whip, got out the word on Monday that the Republicans would only be content with a bill that enacted new tax cuts for the wealthiest as well as the most vulnerable&#8211;anything else, he says, is a &#8220;nonstarter.&#8221; And Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, proposed legislation for new tax cuts that would be the same as the Bush tax cuts for everybody. See Herszenhorn, <a target="_blanlk" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/us/politics/14cong.html?_r=1">Senate G.O.P. Digs In to Keep Tax Cuts</a>, NY Times, Sept. 13, 2010.</p>
<p>The cost of enacting new tax cuts that provide the same revenue reductions as the Bush tax cuts will be enormous. It will cost $700 billion over ten years for the new tax cuts for the wealthy and a total of $4 trillion over ten years to extend all of the Bush tax cuts.</p>
<p>McConnell&#8217;s argument is that it would hurt economic growth and job creation to tax the ultra wealthy now. But that&#8217;s a sham argument. The wealthy are likely to save, not spend, any extra monies from a new tax cut. Or invest it overseas. Or just buy some more stock on the secondary market&#8211;making a bank or another wealthy person even wealthier. They aren&#8217;t likely to start a new company or directly invest in a new start up just because they get a little more spare change from a tax cut. They&#8217;d either be doing that already or not doing it at all. And McConnell, as the Times piece notes, isn&#8217;t offering either specific spending cuts that won&#8217;t hurt the economy nor other sources of revenue to make up for the additional $700 billion needed to give these multimillionaires another tax break in addition to all of the breaks targeting the wealthy already in the Code.</p>
<p>What about McConnell&#8217;s argument that the Obama regime has spent the last two years putting the government in charge of everything? Note he included student loans. Just a reminder about the FACTS about the student loan issue. We used to have a direct loan program. It actually made money for the government. But due to funny accounting procedures that were used for such loans, the books didn&#8217;t look like the loans were making money for the government. That&#8217;s because they were counted as &#8220;pure&#8221; expenditures, and not as loans that included an obligation for the borrower to pay the money back to the government with interest. So they made money, but looked like they didn&#8217;t make money. The GOP seized on this, and under Reagan changed the program to a &#8220;guaranteed loan&#8221; program. The same universities would do the work, but the banks would get a significantly larger interest rate than the government had gotten for acting as a middleman but bearing no losses. In other words, the GOP privatized the loan program, ensuring banks a &#8220;cut&#8221; of profits, and providing for the government to pay the banks for any losses they might incur&#8211;privatization of gains, socialization of losses. There was less money to lend, since the banks were getting the interest income and paid by the government if there were losses. The government was losing money instead of making money. But it LOOKED LIKE the government was smaller. And the GOP bragged about its new privatized loan program. As years went on, people argued for a return to the direct loan program. This was especially true when banks managed to get students to consolidate old loans and retain their higher subsidized rate even when they were supposed to reset the rate to a lower rate. So Clinton inaugurated a small direct loan program. And we have moved from there forward, saving the government money and providing students with a cheaper loan program. The only losers in the direct loan program are the banks who no longer get their &#8220;entitlement&#8221; &#8220;welfare&#8221; handout from the government. And McConnell condemns the Dem for that change, hoping that Americans will be gullible enough to be fooled into thinking that the direct loan program represents an awful invasion into private commerce, instead of a reasonable and wise use of government funds to provide students the opportunity to have a college education.</p>
<p>By the way, Lieberman is, as usual, supporting the GOP platform on taxes with a statement that &#8220;the more money we leave in private hands, the quicker our economic recovery will be.&#8221; When private spending has declined, that statement is not only likely wrong, it misses the fact that without government spending there is likely to be no recovery.</p>

<p>Stormy asks in an e-mail:  At one time, I thought America was supposed to lead the way in green technology, providing jobs for Americans&#8230;and sends this quote from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/07/AR2010090706933.html?wpisrc=nl_pmheadline">Washington Post</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The last major GE factory making ordinary incandescent light bulbs in the United States is closing this month&#8230; <br />&#8230;<br />What made the plant here vulnerable is, in part, a 2007 energy conservation measure passed by Congress that set standards essentially banning ordinary incandescents by 2014. The law will force millions of American households to switch to more efficient bulbs. <br />&#8230;<br />The resulting savings in energy and greenhouse-gas emissions are expected to be immense. But the move also had unintended consequences. <br />&#8230;<br />Rather than setting off a boom in the U.S. manufacture of replacement lights, the leading replacement lights are compact fluorescents, or CFLs, which are made almost entirely overseas, mostly in China.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, let&#8217;s see. The article seems to imply a whole story- Environmental concerns pushed closings and lost American jobs, which was not forseen, and those awful Chinese somehow wound up with the manufacturing.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ibew.org/articles/09daily/0908/090810_GEShutdown.htm">IBEW notice</a> adds a bit to the story:</p>
<blockquote><p>The news stunned Lexington Local 1627 Business Manager David Butcher, who represents 114 workers at the plant. “I knew there was trouble but that was the last thing I expected to hear,” he said.  </p>
<p>That local had recently negotiated an agreement with the company to help reduce costs by agreeing to a wage freeze and flexible overtime regulations, hoping to buy more time so GE could update its facilities to be more competitive.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/15/AR2010091507173.html">article</a> points to our responses on trade.  It describes the next generation  after flourescent technology of lighting using <strong>LED technology</strong>.  </p>
<p>The Federal government either has no role to play in trade policy to benefit its own citizens according to free trade enthusiasts, or possibly is only part of a short term &#8216;stimulus&#8217; package for green technology. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/one-obligation-to-increase-shareholder.html">Bottom line decisions</a> on how and where to do business are global in nature without regard to your role as a citizen.  Admired from afar it all looks good, but how do you voice a concern for where you belong. </p>
<p>As indicated in the article the role of suggesting incentives has been traditionally a function of municiple and state governments, leaving individual trade agreements with countries to the federal government.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to the notion that the national government of China is offering help to locate a manufacturing site in Mexico with the help of the national Mexican government. And that the current employees to manufacture new light bulbs are drawn from former government employees (NASA).</p>
<p>The national narrative on trade bears little resemblance to the reality of doing business from this point of view.  When listening to speeches it is best to keep this in mind.</p>

<blockquote><p>Yesterday the House Judiciary Committee&#8217;s Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law took a stand for students and consumers by passing the Private Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act of 2010 (H.R. 5043). The bill reverses the unfair and unjustified special protections for lenders of private student loans enacted in 2005. There have been two hearings on the topic in the past year, but this was the first time this bill came up for a vote, and it passed 6-3 with no amendments. Under the new legislation private student loans would once again be treated like other consumer debt in bankruptcy. </p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. Department of Education released new data this week showing that the national &#8220;cohort default rate&#8221; on federal student loans is 7.0 percent. The default rate at for-profit colleges is highest at 11.6 percent &#8211; almost double the average rate for public colleges. Nearly half of all defaulters (43 percent) attended for-profit schools, even though these schools enrolled only about ten percent of all college students during the relevant time period. </p></blockquote>

<p>The Census Bureau has released estimates of poverty in 2009.  Coverage focused on the headline poverty rate which is horrible enough.  Much worse, 6.3% of people in the USA suffered severe poverty, that is lived in households with income less than half the poverty line.  This is the highest severe poverty rate on record (the series only goes back to 1975 &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why).  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/historical/people.html">Look at Table Five.</a></p>
<p>That means that over 19 million people in the USA live in households with income less than half the poverty line (severe poverty implies income significantly less than $ 11,000 yr for a family of four) </p>
<p>I blame welfare reform.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Like the poverty rate, the severe poverty rate goes up in recessions, goes up when inequality increases and goes down when per capita income grows.  However, the pattern is very different with a long term trend of increasing severe poverty and no correspond trend of the headline poverty rate.  </p>
<p>I think it is clear that this can be explained with two acronyms AFDC and TANF.  In 1975 the economy was in bad shape, the poverty rate was 12.3 % which is not that much lower than the 2009 poverty rate of 14.3%.  The severe poverty rate was 3.7 % less than 60% of the current rate.  The fraction of people in poverty but not severe poverty was actually lower in 1975 than it is now.</p>
<p>During the period of high inflation, the real value of welfare benefits declined.  This explains at least part of the increase in severe poverty.  In 1983 the poverty rate peaked at 15.2% and the severe poverty rate peaked at 5.9%.  Compared to 1983 a smaller fraction of people are in poverty but a larger fraction of people are in severe poverty.  I think that welfare reform is the only plausible explanation.</p>
<p>If the ratio of number in severe poverty to number in poverty were the same as in 1983 the severe poverty rate would be less than 5.6%.  In other words the number of severely poor people in the USA would be lower by more than 2,250,000.  </p>
<p>It is basically universally agreed that welfare reform was a great success (as argued for example by Barack Obama in &#8220;The Audacity of Hope&#8221;).  I think this conclusion is based on two gross and obvious errors.  </p>
<p>First the matter was considered to have been decided by 2000.  Only specialists reconsidered the analysis of welfare reform with any data not collected during the amazing boom of the late 90s.  </p>
<p>Second a huge amount of attention is focused on the poverty rate and almost no one ever looks at the severe poverty rate.  It is as if people think that it doesn&#8217;t matter how poor one is once one is under the poverty line.  This is more extreme than not caring about income distribution. </p>
<p>But it is accepted as a fact that welfare reform worked like a charm.  Evidence which isn&#8217;t less than 10 years old and the fact that $11,000 <br />It&#8217;s almost as if most people had no clue what it is like to be poor so that they don&#8217;t even know that the poor are much poorer than they used to be.</p>

<p>Others are either more neutral or more hopeful for her role with this administration.</p>

<p>Matty Yglesias has <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/09/usterilized-foreign-exchange-interventions-might-be-the-last-best-hope-for-growth/">an amazing catch</a>.  He says that competitive devaluations achieved via unsterilized interventions would be a good thing, becuase they would cause inflation.  He notes that someone disagrees.</p>
<p>The Economist’s Buttonwood</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2010/09/currencies_gold_and_international_competition">&#8220;The result is like a game of deflationary pass the parcel&#8230;&#8221;  </a></p>
<p>Of course, Mr or Ms Buttonwood should have written </p>
<p>&#8220;The result is like a game of inflationary pass the parcel&#8230;&#8221; which is Yglesias&#8217;s point.  </p>
<p>The dark ages of macro.  I think what is happening is that Buttonwood is sure that selfish begger thy neighbor policies are bad and that allegedly painless remedies based on printing money and buying stuff are unwise, that he or she has noticed that these days deflation is even more feared than inflation and thus decided that printing currency and buying stuff must be deflationary.</p>

<p><strong>HEALTH CARE: Obama Administration Gets Tough With Insurers</strong></p>
<p>DHHS Secretary Sebelius has lambasted the private health insurance industry  in a letter to the industry&#8217;s trade association (I&#8217;m not a big friend of health insurance companies, FWIW). From the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/09/20100909a.html">letter</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be zero tolerance for this type of misinformation and unjustified rate increases.&#8221; </p>
<p>The issue is premium increases and the cause of the premium increases.</p>
<p>PPACA (Obamacare) requires more lives on some policies and more coverage broadly, so no wonder premiums will be going up in the short and near term (some of us predicted this).</p>
<p>There is little likelihood of bending the cost curve for at least five years, as the various and numerous programs in Obamacare phase in and ramp up. And then, who knows.</p>
<p>Understanding that politicians must by nature take care of politics, this seems a little shrill and over the top.</p>
<p>Having spent the summer going through the deep dark details of PPACA, I&#8217;m working on a theory or two on how this will play out.</p>

<p>This whole post is after the jump as my accounting is not ready for prime time.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=6995">Scott Sumner thinks he is the first to note that the cost to the US government of bailing out the big banks is more likely to be a profit than a cost. </a> Clearly he doesn&#8217;t read angry bear much, as I have been predicting that for months.</p>
<p>His accounting strikes me as very odd.  Last I hear, the total cost of bailouts (including GSEs, AIG, GM and Chrysler) was predicted to be $87 billion.  This does not include the cost of the FDIC honoring its contracts which was not discretionary and not a bailout by any normal use of the word.</p>
<p>Now Sumner reports the good news that the cost not including GM and Chrysler will be only 158 billion ?!? </p>
<p>Huh what happened ?  First I think he forgot about roughly 125 billion when he wrote &#8220;Last time I wrote on this subject the eventual cost to the government from bailing out the big banks was estimated at a negative $7 billion–in other words a profit to Uncle Sam of $7 billion.&#8221;  I believe that when he wrote &#8220;the government&#8221; and &#8220;uncle Sam&#8221; he meant &#8220;The Treasury&#8221;.  Uncle Sam also has this little organization called the Federal Reserve Board.  Last I heard it was predicted to make a profit of 125 billion out of its bailout efforts.  Not all of that involved big banks, but I just don&#8217;t believe that the government made only 7 billion out of its direct interactions with big banks.  In any case, the 125 billion (or probably more now) seems to have escaped Prof. Sumner&#8217;s notice entirely.</p>
<p>The news which he reports is that the current guess is that the cost of bailing out AIG is going to be about zero.  That is, the amount AIG owes is roughly equal to the expected present value of future repayments.</p>
<p>Sumner gets his huge loss overall because he describes the cost of bailing out Fannie and Freddie as &#8220;$165 billion and rising.&#8221;  I believe this is the amount they owe the Treasury minus zero.  Sumner argues that big banks and AIG were OK investments and GSEs weren&#8217;t because in one case he includes expected discounted repayments and in the other he decides they are zero.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the GSE rescue involved loans at 10% per year and the GSE debt is not equal to money transferred from the Treasury to GSEs plus the interest the Treasury paid on that extra debt.  Oh no.  It is the amount transfered plus penalty interest rates charged on that amount.</p>
<p>Basically, I beleive that Sumner did not stick to a consistent definition of &#8220;cost&#8221; and redefines the word so as to generate meaningless numbers which confirm his prejudices.</p>
<p>Also he doens&#8217;t understand the extent of the US government and thinks it is just the department of the Treasury.</p>
<p>One of us is profoundly confused.</p>

<blockquote><p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will hear directly this week from U.S. investors about what they want in terms of regulation of financial professionals providing investment advice and the extent to which they are confused as to who is held to  a fiduciary duty. <br />&#8230;<br />The organizations holding the news conference sponsored the survey in response to concerns that the SEC is receiving extensive feedback from financial industry groups, but relatively little from the U.S. investing public.  As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC is requesting public input, comments, and data on issues related to the effectiveness of existing standards of care for brokers-dealers and investment advisers, and whether there are gaps, shortcomings, and other problem issues in the current legal or regulatory standards.<br />&#8230;<br />TO PARTICIPATE:  You can join this live, phone-based news conference (with full, two-way Q&#038;A) at 1:30 p.m. EDT on September 15, 2010 by dialing 1 (800) 860-2442. Ask for the “SEC financial reform/fiduciary survey&#8221; news event.</p>
<p>CAN’T PARTICIPATE?:  A streaming audio recording of the news event will be available on the Web as of 5 p.m. EDT on September 15, 2010 at http://www.hastingsgroup.com/fiduciarysurvey.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>CRUSHING TAX BURDEN &#8482;</strong></p>
<p>I have been putting some information together for an article about the cost of paying the money borrowed from the Social Security Trust Fund, and I found a chart among my papers breaking down the effective tax rate among the different income levels. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t know where it came from, so if it&#8217;s interesting enough that you to want to know the source, you are going to have to look for it.</p>
<p>It is similar to information I found in Statistical Abstracts &#8230; though the information there was for 2007, with total AGI, for example, at 8.0 Trillion. The following <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/federal_govt_finances_employment/federal_individual_income_tax_returns.html" target="_blank">link</a> gives similar information for 2006</p>
<p>My chart shows for the year (2008 or 2009?) there were 141 Million income tax returns filed, reporting a total of 8.8 Trillion dollars in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), and a total of 1.1 Trillion dollars in income taxes paid. This would put the &#8220;average&#8221; income tax for all income levels at 12.5%.</p>
<p>The breakdown:</p>
<p>     The richest one percent of the population, who make more than 410 thousand dollars per year (AGI) pay an income tax rate of 22%. (Rdan&#8230;Does not include less taxed capital gains and estate income)</p>
<p>     The next top 4% of the population, earning over 160k but less than 410k, pay an income tax rate of 18%</p>
<p>     The 5% of the population earning over 113k but less than 160k, pay an income tax rate of 13%</p>
<p>     The 15% of the population earning over 67k but less than 113k, pay an income tax rate of 9%</p>
<p>     The 25% of the population earning over 33k but less than 67k, pay an income tax rate of 7%</p>
<p>     The 50% of the population earning less than 33k, pay an income tax rate of 3%.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t often see the breakdown in these terms. The people who get paid to confuse you want you to think of the top 10% of earners paying 50% of the taxes. Their numbers are meaningless because without knowing what percent of total income such earners get, you don&#8217;t even know if this is a flat tax. And of course it &#8220;sounds like&#8221; they are paying 50% of their income in taxes.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />From my perspective, it does not look like any of these groups is &#8220;over taxed.&#8221; Of course no one, not even me, likes paying taxes. But only the truly simple minded think we can run the country without taxes, and until we can arrive at a consensus about what spending to cut, we need to pay the bills.</p>
<p>These tax rates are 3% lower at the top than they were in 2001, because it was argued that a tax cut at that time would &#8220;pay for itself.&#8221; It didn&#8217;t work out that way.</p>
<p>I will show in an upcoming paper that restoring the tax rate to what it was before the cut&#8230; that is, raising it about 3% on incomes over 100k from what it is today, would be sufficient to pay down the deficit that is the subject of so much political angst. Moreover, in order to pay back the money borrowed from the Social Security Trust Fund, these tax increases would only be needed for about the ten years between 2025 and 2035.</p>
<p>This is not onerous. It would result in a tax rate on the richest one percent of about 25%. The next richest 4% would pay a rate of about 21%, and the next richest 5%(those making more than 113k in the present chart) would pay about 16%.</p>
<p>The purpose of this tax raise would be to reduce the National Debt. It has nothing to do with paying for Social Security. It is repaying the money borrowed FROM Social Security that was used to pay FOR National Security. You would expect the high income earners to be glad to pay it in the spirit of patriotism.</p>
<p>Especially since they know that all along they have been effectively borrowing the money themselves in the form of tax cuts, which they have surely invested in growing the economy and increasing their own personal wealth.</p>
