<p>An Immodest Proposal &#8211; End the Privileges of the Banks</p>
<p>Yesterday I laid out <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/cactus-bail-out-plan-cheaper-better.html">what I think is a better, cheaper, faster</a> approach to the bank bail-out.  But that assumes a bail-out is necessary.  However, I think a bail-out, any bail-out, is a bad idea.</p>
<p>Consider the role of banks.  Banks essentially store money and act as payment agents for depositors, and they loan out money to borrowers. </p>
<p>Now, consider the role of the Fed.  The Fed essentially stores money and acts as a payment agent for the banks, and it loans out money to the banks.  Put another way &#8211; the banks are just an intermediary between the Fed and public.  Put even more simply &#8211; the banks are a middle-man.  Now, back in the day, it was necessary to have a middle-man, someone who knew the local market, who knew the depositors and knew the borrowers, and understood whether making a given load was a good idea.  There&#8217;s no way the Fed, say, could do that from Washington.</p>
<p>But today, things are different.  First, its clear that the banks have no idea who their depositors are, and much less whether the folks borrowing have any chance at all of paying back what they borrowed.  That&#8217;s self-evident from the fact we&#8217;re even debating whether to bail out much of the industry.  Second, in this day and age, what information they do have and use generally comes from third parties.  They aren&#8217;t any better at buying FICO scores than anyone else would be.  </p>
<p>So the question is &#8211; how exactly do we benefit from having the banks operating as a middle-man between the rest of us and the Fed?  Why not let people deposit their money with the Fed, just like banks do, and let people borrow from the discount window, just like banks (and apparently some non-banks) do?  I don&#8217;t see the benefits to giving banks rights that people don&#8217;t have, but I do see plenty of cost.  I see a lot of duplication of services between various banks, and I see huge salaries going to the bank executives for that duplication and for acting as middle-men&#8230; and that doesn&#8217;t even count the cost of the current bail-out.  Note also &#8211; salaries at the Fed are much lower.  I believe Big Bad Ben Bernanke makes about $200K, a pittance compared to the salaries received by the CEOs of a number of banks recently driven into the ground.  And there ain&#8217;t no stock options at the Fed either!</p>
<p>So I propose letting the public bank at the Fed, just the same way banks bank at the Fed.  I&#8217;m not proposing banks be made illegal &#8211; if they can find a way to operate without having a getting privileged access to the Fed, wonderful.  That&#8217;s free enterprise and it should be applauded.  But the current system, where banks get privileged access to the Federal Reserve is rather unfair, and its been that way since long before this mess began.<br />_________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p>by Ken Houghton</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe David Leonhardt is an idiot, but that&#8217;s not based on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/business/24leonhardt.html?ref=business&#038;pagewanted=print">the evidence at hand</a>:<br />
<blockquote>There are really only two [questions]: What steps are most likely to solve the immediate crisis? And how can the long-term cost to taxpayers be minimized?</p>
<p>Everything else — reducing executive pay on Wall Street, changing the bankruptcy laws, somehow slowing the descent of home prices — is either a detail or a distraction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me say this slowly, so even a NYT reporter can understand it: If you are taking an equity stake in a firm, one factor is how much cash the firm will have on hand.  Cash paid to executives is not cash on hand, nor can it be used to produce future capital, investments, and free cashflow, or even &#8220;the miracle of compound interest.&#8221;  So executive pay is very much a factor in equity calculations.</p>
<p>Changing the bankruptcy laws is more tangential, but let&#8217;s again explain this slowly. Mortgage-backed securities are, well, backed by <em>mortgages</em>.  Their value depends directly on those payments.  If it becomes easier to workout a mortgage in bankruptcy court, the holders of those MBSes are liable to (1) receive a higher value and (2) know sooner how severely their securities are impaired.  So changing the bankruptcy law will, again, make the value of the assets clearer sooner.  <em>Which is especially important if we&#8217;re all going to pretend that this thing is going away after two years.</em>*</p>
<p>Slowing the descent of home prices—well, that&#8217;s a second-order effect, so I&#8217;ll agree with him there.  Or at least let it ride.**</p>
<p>His next paragraph, however, is incomprehensible:<br />
<blockquote>Usually, it would be easy enough to dismiss these sideshows as the inevitable gear-grinding of democracy. This is an extraordinary time, though. The credit markets are nearly dysfunctional, leaving the economy at risk of falling into a downturn unlike any most of us have lived through, and the government is about to commit billions of dollars after only a week of political debate. There&#8217;s no time to waste. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: the government (meaning here the Executive Branch and the Federal Reserve, controlled and run by Republicans) has <em><strong>already</strong></em> committed billions of dollars over the past six months. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/900-billion-for-you-citizennever.html">Maybe $900,000,000,000</a>. During the entire time of which, Mr. Paulson was (1) certain the crisis was over and (2) working on the <s>idiocy</s> plan that he presented.</p>
<p>Leonhardt&#8217;s very next sentence undermines his previous paragraph.<br />
<blockquote>The first thing to understand is that a bailout plan doesn’t have to cost anywhere close to $700 billion, so long as it’s designed well. [italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the plan that included absolute authority for the Secretary of the Treasury, and of which the Secretary of the Treasury said, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not asking for absolute authority,&#8221; right?  I would again invoke Daniel Davies&#8217;s Three Laws, but Leonhardt wants us to believe that this time will be different, if the plan is well-designed.***<br />
<blockquote>Figuring out how much to pay for the assets is the first problem. The drop in house prices and rise in foreclosures have made it clear that these securities are worth considerably less than banks expected. But there is enormous uncertainty about how much less.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s why we have a market, no?  (Clearly, the answer will be &#8220;no.&#8221;)<br />
<blockquote>Based on the underlying fundamentals (like the current foreclosure rate and the one forecast for the future), many of the securities appear to be worth something on the order of 75 percent of their original value. But thanks to the fear now gripping the market — not necessarily an irrational fear, given that most forecasts have proven far too sunny over the last year — very, very few of those securities are trading hands. Among those that have, the sales price has been roughly 25 percent of the value. [I italicized, but he blocked it off in the first place; the bold is mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>So the market has a price, but Mr. Leonhardt wants us to believe that these securities could be worth three times as much.</p>
<p>Assume I do.  What should I be willing to pay for those securities? And what would I offer for them?</p>
<p>Now assume several of us believe that.  What will be we do?  Well, I&#8217;ll offer the current market price, Tom will offer 25.5, Robert will go 26, and pretty soon we&#8217;ll own all we want somewhere around 65.****</p>
<p>So where are the hedge funds and investment managers and new Vulture Funds?  Who believes these securities are worth 75?  Surely, they are willing to bid 25, 26, even 30.  Mr. Leonhardt doesn&#8217;t tell us.  In fact, the people who know the market best—Barack Obama&#8217;s classmate, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/trickle-down-in-action.html">Tom Marano</a>, for instance—are retrenching, even after the first $900,000,000,000 in liquidity has been added.<br />
<blockquote> Which price is the government going to pay?&#8230;[I]t probably can&#8217;t pay 25 cents. That might fail to fix the credit markets, because it would do relatively little to improve financial firms’ balance sheets. Firms might then remain unwilling to lend money to businesses and households, which is the whole problem the bailout is meant to solve.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, wait.  I thought that list of side considerations above were unimportant; now it turns out they&#8217;re &#8220;the whole problem the bailout is meant to solve.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote> The most obvious solution is to pay more than 25 cents on the dollar and then demand something in return for the premium — namely, a stake in any firm that participates in the bailout. Congressional Democrats have been pushing for such a provision this week, and it’s one of the most important things they have done.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s nice to know.  Too bad it wasn&#8217;t in the original &#8220;well-designed&#8221; plan.  I guess David Leonhardt believed Dick Fuld when he said he, er, gave at the office, too.<br />
<blockquote>The government would then be accomplishing three things at once. First, it would take possession of the bad assets now causing a panic on Wall Street. Second, it would inject cash into the financial system and help shore up firms’ balance sheets (which some economists think is actually a bigger problem than the bad assets).</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a link to Krugman&#8217;s column on Monday omitted here.  But let&#8217;s look at what Leonhardt has just done:
<ol>
<li>He has admitted they are &#8220;bad assets,&#8221; while before they were just underpriced.</li>
<li>He has declared that it would &#8220;inject cash into the financial system,&#8221; rather ignoring (again) the previous $900,000,000,000 than the Fed has &#8220;injected&#8221; in lieu of easing rates further.</li>
<li>He has invoked &#8220;balance sheets,&#8221; for discussion of which I refer you to <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2008/09/the-left-and-ri.html">David Altig</a> (h/t <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/09/22/financial-one-liner-of-the-day?tid=true">Felix</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>But the best is yet to come.<br />
<blockquote>And, third, it would go a long way toward minimizing the ultimate cost to taxpayers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Overpayment is good because we&#8217;ll get more back.  And I thought only Health Economics had an upward-sloping demand curve.<br />
<blockquote>Why? The more that the government overpays for the assets, the larger the subsidy it’s providing to Wall Street — and the more it is pushing up the share prices of Wall Street firms. As Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, notes, the equity stakes allow the government to recapture some of the subsidy down the road. It’s a self-correcting mechanism.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a good thing Leonhardt opened his piece by noting that Congresscritters don&#8217;t know much about the financial markets, but, really, couldn&#8217;t we expect more from Economics writers?******<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Hey, Jack, if you pay me three times what this asset is worth in the market, I&#8217;ll give you an extra fifty cents six years from now.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Sounds like a great deal to me, Lloyd. And that writer in the Times thinks so too.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So far, we have established that Paulson presented a plan that, if it had been well-designed, would be great.  So who is at fault?  Why, Congress, of course:<br />
<blockquote>Instead of a laserlike focus on the big issues, though, Congress has been devoting a good chunk of energy to secondary matters. Some of the proposals, like changing bankruptcy rules to help some homeowners avoid foreclosure, are perfectly reasonable but just won’t do much to cure the credit markets. Others may not even meet that standard.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s try this again. Homeowners who avoid foreclosure can, unlike those who don&#8217;t, pay their mortgage. Which monies flow to (wait for it) Mortgage-Backed Securities.  Which then gain value and can be sold at a higher price.  So, if you really want to reduce the cost of the bailout, keeping people out of foreclosure seems as if it would help. A lot more than seeing a stock price appreciate later, as was suggested <s>in that well-designed plan</s> <em>by Chris Dodd, Barack Obama, and Congress</em>.</p>
<p>And then Leonhardt just outright jumps the shark:<br />
<blockquote>One of the fashionable ideas of the week, supported by both Democratic leaders in Congress and John McCain, is to limit the pay of top executives at any Wall Street firm that sells assets to the government. </p></blockquote>
<p>Not even CNN fell for that one completely, despite their <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/23/campaign.wrap/index.html">idiotic headline</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Contrary to the lies told by the McCain campaign, it was John McCain who followed Sen. Obama&#8217;s lead in laying out principles that call for strict oversight and accountability, protecting taxpayers and cracking down on CEO pay. We only wish he had adopted those same principles over the last 26 years rather than cheerleading for the deregulation agenda that helped produce today&#8217;s crisis and repeatedly opposing limitations on the obscene compensation given to failed CEOs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And it doesn&#8217;t take a long use of The Google (well, I just went to Brad DeLong&#8217;s site) <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/barack-obama-pr.html">to find, from Sunday night</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Rescue requires mutual responsibility. As taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary steps to protect our financial system, it is only appropriate to expect those institutions that benefit to help protect American homeowners and the American economy. We cannot underwrite continued irresponsibility, where CEOs cash in and our regulators look the other way. We cannot abet and reward the unconscionable practices that triggered this crisis. We have to end them. [italic mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s rather clear, no?  Not to Leonhardt, who tries one last time:<br />
<blockquote>And in a frenzied week, any time spent on talking about C.E.O. pay is time not spent on designing the toughest possible bailout package.</p></blockquote>
<p>Give you a hint, David.  Pass a large portion of the firm&#8217;s revenues to Dick Fuld or Hank Greenberg or Vikram Pandit and there won&#8217;t be any effing stock appreciation for you to claim to have &#8220;reduced the cost&#8221; in the end. Even the Chamber of Commerce knows this.</p>
<p>*Brought to you by the administration that expected its Iraq Adventure to last six days, maybe six weeks at most.<br />**In the context, I&#8217;m inclined to argue, under that same &#8220;two year&#8221; timeframe, that they should want to accelerate the decline in prices.  As a current seller, I object, though.<br />***For starters, it was designed to be initiated and run by a man who is unlikely to be in that same position six months from now.  That this might be an elementary design flaw seems to have escaped Mr. Leonhardt.<br />****The extra ten is because we are not so stupid as Mr. Leonhardt, on whom someone pulled &#8220;75&#8221; out of his backside.  No, we bid 65 because we know there is substantial uncertainty in that &#8220;75,&#8221; and we pulled &#8220;65&#8221; out of our backside.*****<br />*****Robert is now trying to figure out a correlation matrix for this.<br />******Ben Stein and Robert Samuelson always excepted.</p>

<p>Major financial crisis news.</p>
<blockquote><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it will get a $5 billion investment from billionaire Warren Buffett&#8217;s company, marking one of the biggest expressions of confidence in the financial system since the credit crisis intensified early this month.</p></blockquote>
<p>Look $5 billion is not just a vote of confidence.<br />Goldman Sachs is in good shape *now*.  Goldman&#8217;s balance sheet just improved, because they have $5 billion more in assets and no more debt (Buffett bought equity).</p>
<p>update: I should have noted that $ 5 billion increases G-S total equity by about 10% as you can guess from the details of the deal.</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/quotes/main.html?type=djn&#038;symbol=GS">Goldman Sachs<br />47,563.75  Market Cap(Mil)<br /></a><br /><a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?fstype=ii&#038;q=NYSE:GS"><br />That would be about 0.5% of total assets.</a> hardly just a pat on the back.</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2008/09/four_down_one_to_go.html">Kevin Drum</a></p>
<p>Rabid Buffett envy below the fold.  <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2008/09/how-much-should-we-be-willing-to-pay-to.html">I did say there was a killing to be made saving banks.</a></p>
<p>My guess is that he will make a killing (again) as G-S equity was already underpriced (panic you know) and is now worth more, because of him.</p>
<p>And what a deal he drove</p>
<blockquote><p>The deal is structured in two parts, giving Berkshire a stream of cash and potential ownership of roughly 10% of Goldman. Berkshire will spend $5 billion on &#8220;perpetual&#8221; preferred shares of Goldman. These are not convertible into equity but pay a fat 10% dividend.</p>
<p>Berkshire also will get warrants granting it the right to buy $5 billion of Goldman common stock at $115 a share, which is 8% below the 4 p.m. closing share price Tuesday of $125.05. </p></blockquote>
<p>Wow 10% plus warrants.  Now G-S won&#8217;t go bankrupt, as they have no legal obligation to pay a dividend on the preferred shares, but they can&#8217;t pay a dividend on common stock until Buffet gets his $500,000,000 a year.</p>
<p>OK so now Morgan Stanley.  They are probably in worse shape than G-S but I&#8217;m sure a deal can be made.  Problem is that there is no one with as much free cash as Buffett and as much brains (maybe or not and).  Still I think he might tell his friends Bill and Melinda that there is money to be made saving Morgan Stanley from itself.</p>
<p>If there not interested Morgan Stanley&#8217;s hopes of independent survival are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Slim_Hel%C3%BA">Slim</a>.</p>
<p>My guess is that he looked at the killer deal Ben and Hank made with AIG and said to himself &#8220;I can do that too&#8221;.</p>
<p>This also relieves Paulson&#8217;s conflict of interest.  I wonder if his attitude will change.</p>

                                <p>by stormy</p>
<p>Many writers have noted that the administration is asking for an unregulated bailout. It is, in fact, <i>an unregulated bailout of an unregulated industry</i>.</p>
<p>For years now, the Republicans have complained that the government is the problem: Get government out of the marketplace. Let free and unregulated markets decide what is best. Well, they got their wish. Now they want the government to save their skins. Their bloated corporate carcasses are simply too big to be left in the public sun.</p>
<p>Globalization has been akin to the wild west: Each man is his own law, grabbing what he can. We have sweat shop labor camps and cryptically packaged poisoned financial instruments. What has been the result?</p>
<p>Some rascals cut corners, giving us deadly toys and even deadlier milk. Others, dressed in Armani suits, cleverly fashioned intricate tranches and arcane credit default swaps.</p>
<p><i>Transparency</i> has often been the buzz word when we complain about China. When a Chinese company published fradulent financial statements, lack of transparency was the answer. When Chinese, Russian, or Indian companies pay bribes&#8230;.no transparency. Japan complains of China&#8217;s lack of transparency in Tibet. The U.S. wants more transparency regarding China&#8217;s military modernization. Are we complaining about Chinese subsidies? Well, they have no transparency, apparently.</p>
<p>And yet, and yet, here in the U.S. lack of transparency is the name of the game. We have nourished a shadow banking system, a system that lies outside of Fed regulation: hedge funds, investment banks&#8230;. When you cannot see what is happening, what lies really beneath the covers, you should worry.</p>
<p>I see little difference in principle between rascals in China cutting corners on milk and rascals in the U.S. cutting corners on investment vehicles. Secrecy in both is critical. Everything is opaque.</p>
<p>Is there really a difference between China&#8217;s milk scandal and the financial wizards in the shadow banking system? Not really. The only difference is that China executed their former food and safety chief. We are much more humane: Many who made immense personal fortunes out of the present scandal will remain untouched. We merely suggest that they forego any golden parachute as they jet off to gated island sanctuaries&#8230;to play golf and laze in the sun.</p>
<p>As Wall Street folds up its tend and disappears into the night, we now come to the end game: an unregulated bailout, a bailout that lacks any transparency whatsoever. Paulson can buy and sell mortgage related securities. Buy what for how much and sell to whom for how much? Whose skin is being pulled out of the fire?</p>
<p>And how much of that 700 billion slush fund is to be paid to what experts giving what advice?</p>
<p>Will all books be open as to what will happen? Will we be able to read in detail each and every transaction? each and every paycheck?</p>
<p>As assets are purchased, we will be allowed to see in detail those assets?</p>
<p>As the assets are sold, will we see who bought them and for how much? Are we to believe that this process will be corruption free?</p>
<p>Why not open the books, all the books? Why not be transparent? I have a stake in what happens. Should I not be allowed to see all the detail?</p>
<p>Paulson wants the whole process outside the rule of law. If some unscrupulous scoundrel&#8211;be he seller, buyer, or hiree&#8211; games this system, is he too outside the rule of law?</p>
<p>Ah transparency! Ah responsibility! At least China executed those responsible for the milk scandal. What will we do? Give them more opportunities to game an increasingly unregulated system?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s open the all the books.</p>

<p>Via <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/09/23/brooks/index.html">Glenn Greenwald</a>, a riff that is going around (see <a href="http://orchidgrrlnyc.blogspot.com/">orchidgrrl nyc</a> for <a href="http://orchidgrrlnyc.blogspot.com/2008/09/channeling-fafblog.html">the faux-Fafblog version</a>), has become reality—<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4810644.ece">in India</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Corporate India is in shock after a mob of sacked workers bludgeoned to death the chief executive who had dismissed them from a factory in a suburb of Delhi.</p></blockquote>
<p>The punchline, as it were:<br />
<blockquote>It is understood that Mr Choudhary&#8230;had called a meeting with more than 100 former employees &#8211; who had been dismissed following an earlier outbreak of violence at the plant &#8211; to discuss a possible reinstatement deal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Any similarity to the mayor in The Dark Knight Returns is coincident.</p>
<p>AngryBear urges others <em>not</em> to follow this example. Surely there are better ways.</p>

<p>I need to ask you to support an urgent secret business  relationship with a<br />transfer of funds of great magnitude.<br />I am Ministry of  the Treasury of the Republic of America. My country has had<br />crisis that has  caused the need for large transfer of funds of 800 billion<br />dollars US. If you  would assist me in this transfer, it would be most<br />profitable to you.<br />I am  working with Mr. Phil Gram, lobbyist for UBS, who will be my<br />replacement as  Ministry of the Treasury in January. As a Senator, you may<br />know him as the  leader of the American banking deregulation movement in the<br />1990s. This  transactin is 100% safe.<br />This is a matter of great urgency. We need a blank  check. We need the funds<br />as quickly as possible. We cannot directly transfer  these funds in the names<br />of our close friends because we are constantly under  surveillance. My family<br />lawyer advised me that I should look for a reliable  and trustworthy person<br />who will act as a next of kin so the funds can be  transferred.<br />Please reply with all of your bank account, IRA and college fund  account<br />numbers and those of your children and grandchildren to<br /><a href="mailto:wallstreetbailout@treasury.gov">wallstreetbailout@treasury.gov</a>  so that we may transfer your commission for<br />this transaction. After I receive  that information, I will respond with<br />detailed information about safeguards  that will be used to protect the<br />funds.<br />Yours Faithfully Minister of  Treasury Paulson<br />&#8212;</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/garbage_pail_/2008/09/a_krugmanite_tweak_to_the_dodd_plan.php">don&#8217;t know</a>, and am asking.  My initial thought is not so much, because the Dodd contingency looks pretty tough (why it&#8217;s generally been favorably received in the econoblogiverse) assuming it makes it into a bailout law:<br />
<blockquote>3) VESTING OF SHARES.—If, after the pur-<br /> chase of troubled assets from a financial institution,<br /> the amount the Secretary receives in disposing of<br /> such assets is less than the amount that the Sec-<br /> retary paid for such assets, the contingent shares re-<br /> ceived by the Secretary under paragraph (1) shall<br /> automatically vest to the Secretary on behalf of the<br /> United States Treasury in an amount equal to—<br /> (A) 125 percent of the dollar amount of <br />  the difference between the amount that the Sec- <br />  retary paid for the troubled assets and the dis- <br />  position price of such assets; divided by<br /> (B) the amount of the average share price<br /> of the financial institution from which such as-<br /> sets were purchased during the 14 business<br /> days prior to the date of such purchase.<br />[Emphasis added.]</p></blockquote>
<p>So when the &#8220;G. W. Bush Memorial Fund&#8221; sells a Troubled Asset at a loss, the shareholders in the firm that dumped the Troubled Asset pay the Treasury 125% of the loss in equity.  In effect, the Fund a la Dodd provides liquidity while privatizing the losses, which is a 180-degree turnaround from the original Treasury proposal.  Dodd seems to have brought a BFG to a knife-fight.  (Though I wonder if the above section could use a contingency for the case in which 125% of the Troubled Assets&#8217; losses exceeds the equity in the firm.)</p>
<p>In fact, I think the difference in taxpayer exposure with the original Paulson trial balloon can hardly be overstated.  In the original plan, the taxpayer&#8217;s losses were limited mainly by how rapidly Treasury chose to liquidate securities for which it overpaid and the overall Federal debt limit.  Dodd&#8217;s modification ostensibly makes the taxpayer&#8217;s cost of the bailout the opportunity cost of setting up the fund and providing the liquidity.  One might think our foreign funders might be happier to absorb that cost than to fund a huge chunk of socialized losses.  Keep that in mind as we hear the Richard Shelbys of the world announce their supposedly principled opposition.</p>
<p>On a somewhat related note, I recommend this post of <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/garbage_pail_/2008/09/the_market_for_lemons_and_the_garbage_pail_agency.php">Mark Kleiman</a>&#8216;s as crystallizing a thought I&#8217;d had after reading <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/moral-philosoph.html">this one of DeLong&#8217;s</a>.  When I hear talk of &#8220;overpaying&#8221; for assets, I ask relative to what — patient money ought to be able to profit from a panicked market (i.e. which will not pay a &#8216;rational&#8217; price for risk).</p>
<p>Added: <a href="http://mithras.blogs.com/blog/2008/09/how-the-equity.html">Mithras</a> catches that if the Fund&#8217;s acquisition of a seller&#8217;s Troubled Assets doesn&#8217;t stop the seller&#8217;s share price from collapsing following the sale, then the Fund can rack up big net losses in the liquidation.  <s>However, as I read the Dodd draft Mithras&#8217;s Secnario 3 would trigger the contingent-share vesting penalty.</s>  (Thanks to a bit of clarification in the comments, turns out there&#8217;s no difference in our readings.)</p>

                                <p>The Cactus Bail-Out Plan:  Cheaper, Better, Faster</p>
<p>One of the goals of Paulson&#8217;s Bad Joke seems to be to deal with &#8220;counterparty risk.&#8221;  That is, if Bank A can&#8217;t find a greater fool to buy its garbage, it will have trouble paying back Bank B.  It would be cheaper to simply tell Bank B to collect what it can from Bank A&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings, and cut them a check for what&#8217;s left to eliminate the counterparty risk.  Whether helping Bank B makes any sense or not, at least this plan would cost the taxpayer much less, as it wouldn&#8217;t include the expense of keeping Bank A afloat.  So if we&#8217;re going to have a costly bail-out, let&#8217;s at least focus only on bailing out the &#8220;good banks&#8221; and let the &#8220;bad banks&#8221; die.  </p>
<p>The problem with the approach I laid out is that the process can drag on.  But fortunately, if we&#8217;ve learned anything from the Bush administration, its that rushing along at breakneck speed isn&#8217;t a problem if you claim there&#8217;s some sort of national emergency.  So&#8230;  pass the &#8220;Banking Patriot Act.&#8221;  Any bank that is in trouble must liquidate its assets immediately and pay back its creditors to the best of its ability.  The government would use its $700 billion to compensate the good banks for their counterparty losses.  Voila &#8211; no counterparty risk, no uncertainty in the banking system, no rewarding the bad banks, and the system operates as it should.</p>
<p>But&#8230;   what makes the bad banks go along with this plan?  Well, its simple, really.  A provision of the &#8220;Banking Patriot Act&#8221; allows the government to view any communications by anyone at the bank to see if they&#8217;re in trouble.  And if any bank turns out to be in trouble but did not go along with the &#8220;liquidate immediately&#8221; order &#8211; well, its executives would all be declared enemy bankers, and would be interned at Gitmo.  And there would be waterboarding to find out if those enemy bankers know of other enemy bankers.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />by cactus</p>
