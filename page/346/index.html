<blockquote>This misses another huge challenge altogether, totally absent in the reporting by the New York Times and other main outlets:  Amy Bishop had walked into the Faculty meeting, and sat quietly for a long while during its proceedings, with a fully loaded gun…</p>
<p>It is as if such ease of access to guns, and ability to carry them undetected (or detected?), even by high powered scientist professors in university campus, is simply taken for granted nowadays in the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>UPDATE II: <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/02/professor_accus.html">Everything old is new again</a>.  (h/t <a href="http://twitter.com/GregMitch/statuses/9067059215">Greg Mitchell</a>)</p>
<p>Three <a href="https://www.uah.edu/biology/faculty.html">of these people</a> are, <a href="http://www.detnews.com/article/20100212/NATION/2120453/Woman-held-after-3-die-in-Alabama-university-shooting">according to current reports</a>, dead.</p>
<p>Details <s>to follow elsewhere</s> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/13/three-dead-alabama-university-shooting">from the Guardian</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A biology professor has been charged with murder after a shooting spree at the University of Alabama, Huntsville, left three dead and three wounded.</p>
<p>Amy Bishop, 42, was charged yesterday with one count of capital murder, which means she could face the death penalty if convicted. Three of Bishop&#8217;s fellow biology professors were killed and three other university employees were wounded.</p>
<p>University spokesman Ray Garner said the three killed were Gopi K Podila, the chairman of the Department of Biological Sciences, and two other faculty members, Maria Ragland Davis and Adriel Johnson&#8230;.</p>
<p>AH student Andrew Cole was in Bishop&#8217;s anatomy class yesterday morning and said she seemed perfectly normal.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s understanding, and was concerned about students,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I would have never thought it was her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bishop, a neurobiologist who studied at Harvard University, was taken in handcuffs to the county jail last night and could be heard saying: &#8220;It didn&#8217;t happen. There&#8217;s no way&#8230; They are still alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police said they were also interviewing a man as &#8220;a person of interest&#8221;.</p>
<p>Three others were wounded in the gunfire. They were identified as department members Joseph Leahy and Stephanie Monticello, both in a critical condition in intensive care, and Luis Cruz-Vera.</p>
<p>Sammie Lee Davis, whose wife was killed in the shooting, gave a phone interview to the Associated Press in which he said he was told his wife was at a meeting to discuss the tenure of another faculty member who got angry and started shooting. He said his wife had mentioned the suspect before, describing the woman as &#8220;not being able to deal with reality&#8221; and &#8220;not as good as she thought she was&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Giving new meaning to &#8220;publish or perish.&#8221;  Or, as 2slugbaits noted in comments:<br />
<blockquote>Huntsville always struck me as one of those towns that has a split personality.  A high end BMW on one side of the garage alongside an old Ford F-150 pickup truck with a gun rack and a Confederate flag design on the back window&#8230;.A town that was essentially founded by a Nazi scientist who is praised by deeply religious Pentecostals as a great man without a past worth mentioning.  Huntsville seems to have a strange effect on people.  I have a lot of friends who have moved there and after a few years they are barely recognizable&#8230;.It&#8217;s a peculiar blending of a transient and rootless culture that was grafted onto a deep Old South culture.  That must be how you end up with guys who are PhD rocket scientists during the week and then on Sunday they believe Adam and Eve rode dinosaurs in 4004 BC.  If you&#8217;re an unstable Harvard educated scientist, Huntsville is probably not a good career choice.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Michael Swanwick explains <a href="http://floggingbabel.blogspot.com/2010/02/boskone.html">how a monopoly can destroy itself</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Nowadays, times are much easier but a lot scammier.  Last week I had to buy a new palmbook/laptop.  Which, I discovered on my first and only day of possession, was preloaded with Windows 7 Starter, a not-fully-functional OS.  When I tried to change the image on my desktop, I learned that doing so required that I go online and buy Windows 7 Home Premier.  After getting my refund, I talked to salesfolk at various stores and learned that all the new palmtops have the cut-down version because they don&#8217;t have memory enough to run W7HP. </p>
<p>Well, each new version of Windows is written far too memory-hoggish for the current hardware.  So it only makes sense that the new OS would have fewer features.  Still, it was pretty cheeky of them to have it automatically try to sell me an OS that my device couldn&#8217;t run.</p>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t play that kind of game, so if I&#8217;d been willing to wait for the iPad to come available, I probably would&#8217;ve spent the extra money for it.  But I have work to do, so I scrounged around until I found one of the dwindling number of netbooks still running on XP.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted before, they did this on laptops with Vista as well.  There is no better way to destroy your reputation that to put out something that doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>(Rdan here&#8230;I thought this case represents another aspect of the complexities of insurance coverage, approved procedures versus experimental, proper diagnosis, and how our medical and societal expectations interact.  Many are aware of the topic but many probably have little personal experience with a transgender person.  I believe it is jarring enough for many to create discussion.)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/02/gender-reassignment-surgery-case-decided.html">Gender reassignment surgery case decided</a></p>
<p>Back in 2005 when the IRS released CCA 200603025 stating that gender reassignment surgery is not a deductible medical expense, I objected.  Gender identity disorder had been recognized by the medical profession, I argued, so why should the IRS rely on a Catholic Church authority who had fought against such surgery for its decision.  Read the post from 2006 <a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2006/07/gender_reassign.html">here</a>.  <br />The Tax Court ruled on the issue today, in O&#8217;Donnabhain v. Comm&#8217;r, 134 T.C. No. 4 (Feb. 2, 2010). As Caron notes on TaxProf (hat tip), the majority recognized gender identity disorder as a disease and gender reassignment surgery as treatment for a disease (though they thought breast augmentation surgery was merely cosmetic).  </p>
<p>Good decision,  except maybe for that bit about breast augmentation being merely cosmetic.  If we were talking about &#8220;Hot Lips&#8221; on Mash I&#8217;d agree.  Or even about any woman who just wants bigger breasts.  But when the subject is a male with gender identity disorder who is undergoing genital and breast surgery to make himself into the female she believes herself to be, then breast augmentation is a critical part of the picture, which the medical standards quoted in the case make clear.  I couldn&#8217;t read the court&#8217;s discussion of this topic without thinking&#8211;but, if you had undergone that surgery, wouldn&#8217;t it be pretty important to have really good breasts?  The court essentially said there wasn&#8217;t enough substantiation that the breast surgery was because of the gender identity disorder.   <br /><a name="more"></a><br />One of the examining physicians who concluded that the petitioners were a &#8220;good candidate&#8221; for the surgery also noted that she already appeared to have developed decent breasts (B cup) under hormone therapy.  Yet the surgery is described as &#8220;designed to make petitioner&#8217;s breasts, which had experienced some development as a result of feminizing hormones, more closely resemble the breasts of a genetic female.&#8221;   An expert testified how important it is for persons with this disorder to &#8220;pass&#8217; convincingly in public as female.&#8221;    That does not sound like elective, purely cosmetic surgery to me, but something that is a singificant part of the change in the gender appearance of the individual&#8211; something that &#8220;prevents or treats illness or disease&#8221;&#8211;i.e., a medically deductible expense.  The court concluded that the petitioner hadn&#8217;t shown that the breast surgery &#8220;treated&#8221; the gender disorder.  It seems there was some lack of substantiation, since the recommending physician had not specifically discussed presurgical breast condition.  But I suspect the court is giving more weight to an examining physician&#8217;s statement of &#8220;significant breast development&#8221; than it should&#8211;that could merely mean &#8220;compared to a man without hormone treatment&#8221; but nowhere near normal female breasts.  In fact, the physician that had noted presurgical &#8220;nice shape&#8221; also testified that he meant&#8211;compared to other males on hormones and not compared to ordinary female breasts.  That didn&#8217;t sway the court that there was enough substantiation to support that breast surgery was because of the gender disorder.  </p>
<p>By the way, reading this from the context of a &#8220;battle of the experts&#8221; is interesting.  One government &#8220;expert&#8221;, Dr. Schmidt, was one who has not had a very important role in the matter since the 1980s (not a listed author on articles, not an author of a chapter in a medical reference text on the subject, but had &#8220;participated in evaluation&#8221; of about 12 gender disorder patients a year).  He tried to have it both ways&#8211;unconvinced about the validity of the gender identity disorder diagnosis at this trial, yet testying regularly in other trials (recently) about the diagnosis and admitting that it is taught at medical schools and is something doctors are required to learn about.  The summary of his testimony reads like what one would expect a creationist to say on a stand to defend the teaching of creationism&#8211;hedging and more hedging around the fundamental admission of the disorder, the medical consensus around it, and the real basis for it.  The other government expert was a forensic psychiatrist&#8211;odd choice.  He claimed that gender identity disorder is a mental disorder but not a disease because it isn&#8217;t clear that it arises from a pathological process within the body (in spite of the fact that others have suggested at least three different conditions for disease&#8211;either discomfort, or dysfunction or pathology).  So bulimia, to Dr. Dietz, is not a disease, and obsessive-compulsive disorder wouldn&#8217;t have been one til it was discovered that it has a pathological cause about 20 years ago.  The tax court concluded that the government&#8217;s position against treating gender identity disorder as a disease was &#8220;meritless&#8221;, with no authority whatsoever other than the one expert&#8217;s interpretation,  which &#8220;is flatly contradicted by nearly a half century of caselaw.&#8221;  Id. at 37.  Further Dr. Schmidt&#8217;s claims that the disorder is subject to some debate was found unconvincing, since the court was persuaded by &#8220;the widespread recognition of the condition in medical literature&#8221; showing that recognition of the disorder &#8220;is the prevailing view.&#8221;   Even these government witnesses undermined the government&#8217;s claim that the disorder was merely a &#8220;social construction&#8221; since they agreed that it is a serious condition &#8220;sometimes associated with autocastration, autopenectomy and suicide.&#8221;  Id. at 43.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/02/thoughts-on-sovereign-debt.html" target="_blank">Thoughts on soveriegn debt</a></p>
<p>Today the European Union <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/112856.pdf" target="_blank">released a statement</a> about Greece. Absolutely no specifics are given regarding the terms of any Greek bailout, but there was a (slight) surprise: <br />
<blockquote>Euro area Member states will take determined and coordinated action, if needed, to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole. The Greek government has not requested any financial support.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a much broader statement than I was expecting; I take it as a blanket guarantee. Euro area members &#8211; Germany and France being the largest members as measured by aggregate GDP – will support the stability of the euro-zone, meaning that help will be dished out where needed.</p>
<p>I wanted to look at debt levels, not just in Europe but across the world. I suspected (before I made this chart) that the emerging market space would generally reduce debt levels (consistent with broader trends in countries like Indonesia or Mexico), while developed countries would generally increase debt levels. &#8220;Debt&#8221; considerations go deeper than gross debt as a % of GDP. I digress.</p>
<p>Below I illustrate two charts of gross government debt as a percentage of country GDP. The first chart illustrates general government debt burden for 68 countries, emerging and developed markets alike. Global Insight forecasts the numbers, which is proprietary information, but you can see the IMF&#8217;s forecast for free <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/02/weodata/weoselco.aspx?g=2001&#038;sg=All+countries" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<div><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S3SEvZQrmnI/AAAAAAAAC2c/tmEQtcQ8EDk/s1600-h/debt_chart_1%5B3%5D.png"><img alt="debt_chart_1" border="0" height="277" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S3SEv5B0p-I/AAAAAAAAC2g/c-7-X6xyobg/debt_chart_1_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" title="debt_chart_1" width="404"></a>
<div>In the chart, there is a 45-degree line: countries above the 45-degree line are expected to increase debt burden spanning the period 2009 and 2012; countries below the line are expected to lower debt burden over that same time horizon.</p>
<p>Global Insight envisages just three “developed” countries to drop debt burden between now (2009 forecast) and 2012: Netherlands (barely), Norway, and Denmark. Any other debt improvements will occur across the emerging market space (there are quite a few countries, by the way).</p>
<p>The second chart illustrates the same pattern of indebtedness, but for the “big spenders”.</p>
<div><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S3SEwr9CvaI/AAAAAAAAC2k/1Q7mJXSwm6g/s1600-h/debt_chart_2%5B3%5D.png"><img alt="debt_chart_2" border="0" height="277" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S3SEyJBeT7I/AAAAAAAAC2o/4CbFoCrsTbk/debt_chart_2_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" title="debt_chart_2" width="404"></a></div>
<div>I had to separate the big spenders from the rest due to their relative magnitudes of indebtedness. In the big-spenders chart, the Y-values (debt to GDP) span the range of [5%, 255%] rather than [5%, 80%] in the previous chart.</p>
<p>Of the big spenders, Japan is the worst, with debt rising from 229% of GDP expected in 2009 to 230% of GDP by 2012 (this forecast was published before the passage of the Japanese 2010 budget, so indebtedness is likely to be higher still). But it&#8217;s only the worst. There are other countries, Lebanon, Greece, Iceland, USA, fighting for second place. Looks bad, right?</p>
<p>Well&#8230;.maybe&#8230;sort of. Before you start freaking out, there are things that one must consider.</p></div>
<div></div>
<div>External vs. domestic debt</div>
<div>Japan has a lot of gross debt but most of it is issued domestically. Total foreign debt &#8211; debt held by foreign investors &#8211; is expected to be just 22% of GDP in 2009. Having a lot of domestic debt is sometimes okay, as firms, pensions, and households support (define) demand for the debt. On balance, this makes aggregate debt (public plus private) much smaller.</p>
<p>Autonomous monetary policy</p>
<p>This is an important one, and central to Greece’s current situation. If the Greek government could print money – the ECB controls the money supply across the 16-member euro-zone – it would. It would simply print euros pay debt obligations, essentially inflating its way out of debt. Japan and the US can do this, making the risk of default lower.</p>
<p>Of course inflating your way out of debt can cause a much bigger problem if money supply growth gets out of hand. And this method of debt reduction can lead to a much slower and probably more painful way of going bankrupt.</p>

<blockquote>Christie is cutting $475 million in aid to school districts, $62 million in aid to colleges and $12 million to hospital charity care. He is pulling all funding from the department of Public Advocate&#8230;.He is cutting state subsidies for NJ Transit, a move Christie said could lead to higher fares or reduced services but would force the agency to become &#8220;more efficient and effective.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>“I take no joy in having to make these decisions. I know these judgments will affect fellow New Jerseyans and will hurt,&#8221; Christie said. &#8220;This is not a happy moment. However, what choices do we have left?&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Senate budget chairman Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen) said cutting funding for schools was not the same as cutting state spending, and would simply raise property taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chris Christie reprising the plan Christie Whitman used to &#8220;balance&#8221; the budget: the one created by <a href="http://gawker.com/5469601/larry-kudlow-cokehead">Cokehead</a> that has led to <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/03/rise_in_nj_property_taxes_lowe.html">property taxes rising by 50% in the first seven years of this decade alone</a>.</p>

<blockquote>One big reason is that his efforts have made borrowing easy for big companies, those that can sell bonds, but not for consumers or smaller firms that rely on banks to borrow. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a large corporation relying on capital markets, the Fed and Treasury saved you,&#8221; says Charles Calomiris, a Columbia University economist. &#8220;In the other economy, the real engine of job creation, the banks aren&#8217;t lending and bank capital is still very scarce.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>YES IT CAN GET WORSE &#8211; Health Care Edition</p>
<p>Business Week, (a Bloomberg publication), has written some friendly advice for the newly minted elite MBAs who cannot get rich quick on Wall Street as is their birthright.</p>
<p>No, not Plastics. Health care!</p>
<p>MBAs in health care are hardly new, but the thoughts of legions of newly minted Top 20 MBAs invading health care is very frightening.</p>
<p>(Many health care clinicians and executives have earned MBAs, but usually have some actual experience with health care, rather than just showing up with a get-rich-quick attitude.)</p>
<p>So the fresh faced wunderkins may soon be invading an integrated delivery system near you, anxious for a little white coat M&#038;A.<br />_______________________________<br />Tom aka Rusty Rustbelt</p>

                                <p>While several good people—including several of my wife&#8217;s relatives and <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/">one of our bloggers</a>—graduated from Pravda-on-the-Chuck, I am saddened to note that their faculty&#8217;s efforts in creating the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) has been muted.</p>
<p>Such, at least, can be fairly concluded by the nominees and <a href="http://rwer.wordpress.com/vote-here-for-the-dynamite-prize-in-economics/">final ballot for The Dynamite Prize in Economics</a>, being held at the blog of the Real-World Economics Review.</p>
<p>Consider that <a href="http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mankiw">N. Gregory (&#8220;Greg&#8221;) Mankiw</a> was not even nominated. The man who shepherded and shilled for the 2003 tax evisceration* in specific, and author of the textbook that corrupts more Econ 101 people than any other <em>was not even nominated</em>.</p>
<p>Then <a href="http://www.people.hbs.edu/mjensen/index.html">Michael Jensen</a>—whose theories (purely by coincidence, to be sure) are used to justify shifting corporate profits on a massive basis from the company that makes them to the CEO who &#8220;runs&#8221; it—<em>did not make the final ballot</em>.</p>
<p>Even more than the damage done to their endowment—at least <a href="http://firelarrysummersnow.blogspot.com/">the guy who did that</a> is on the final ballot, though for his general U.S. work, not his Endowment-during-his-divorce work—not being cited as responsible for the GFC, and therefore not being seen as Masters of the Universe, is saddening.</p>
<p>The remaining nominees are Very Worthy, to be certain (excepting Paul Samuelson, with whom people much have confused Robert). <a href="http://rwer.wordpress.com/vote-here-for-the-dynamite-prize-in-economics/">Vote early and often</a>.</p>
<p>*It is remotely possible to make the argument that the 2001 cut was based on semi-legitimate (though silly) projections of surpluses  There is no such excuse for the 2003 abomination.</p>
