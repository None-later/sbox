President Bush wants to temporarily increase the deficit.  Fiscal conservatives like <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/09/katrina-tax-surcharge.html">Andrew Samwick</a> have fiscal offsets in mind to avoid adding even more government debt to our children’s future.  <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_buzzcharts/buzzcharts200510040921.asp">Jerry Bowyer</a> sides with Bush:<br />
<blockquote>George W. Bush is not a Goldwater Republican &#8211; he’s a Lincoln Republican. Like the founder of the Republican party, Bush doesn’t mind spending money on his priorities, and he doesn’t mind doing some of this spending with borrowed money. Like Lincoln, he doesn’t mind federal expenditures for what Lincoln called “internal improvements,” such as canals and railroads or, today, new roads and levies in the Gulf. Lincoln, too, was a big borrower, which seems to have worked out okay for the sixteenth president … Some people complain that Katrina rebuilding should not be financed through deficits, but why not? Infrastructure creation is exactly the sort of thing that should be shouldered by government. Current expenses typically come through operating budgets. Expenditures that provide benefits for new generations of Americans go through the capital budget, meaning future generations participate in the cost of the projects that will benefit those future generations. This makes sense. It’s why most corporations have separate capital budgets and operating budgets. It’s why America was right to finance the Civil War, WWI, WWII, and the Cold War through deficits. </p></blockquote>
<p>In theory, Bowyer’s point about capital budgets seems like a good one – especially to someone like myself who has preached the virtues of looking at government budgets from a long-run perspective.  So why did I and other liberal bloggers praise fiscal conservatives such as Dr. Samwick?  Perhaps because the <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/10/fiscal-2005-national-debt-increases.html">General Fund deficit</a> was over $550 billion even during the year that Bowyer’s Fuzzchart showed tax revenues were higher than the incredibly low levels of a couple of years ago.  </p>
<p>While it is true the investment projects provide benefits over the long-term, they must be financed at some point in time along with the financing of government consumption.  But maybe Bowyer is trying to tell us that much of the reason for the Bush deficits is that we are investing more now than we ever had and that the lower level of taxes is consistent with a lower level of government consumption.  In fact, this excuse for offered for the Reagan deficits a generation ago.  But I’m wondering why Bowyer did not provide us one of his charts showing government investment relative to GDP.  Using date from NIPA table 3.1 provided by <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>, we plot government investment relative to GDP from 1975 to 2004.  This ratio has averaged 3.4% over the past 30 years with the most recent level being near 3.2%.  Although this ratio is a bit higher than what we observed in 1998, the massive increase in the General Fund deficit is only partially due to more government investment.  </p>
<p>The Katrina-Rita relief and reconstruction efforts will likely kick this up over the next couple of years as it adds to a General Fund deficit that is already near 5% of GDP.  While the rise in the deficit might only be temporary, the long-run prospect for deficit financing are ominous – unless we start adopting fiscal policy more in line with what the fiscal conservatives are demanding.</p>

                                <p>Tax Analysts reports:<br />
<blockquote>Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., on October 5 said he hopes to energize the tax reform debate with a proposal to replace the federal income tax with an 8.5 percent national retail sales tax on individual purchases and business profits … DeMint plans to introduce the bill, a hybrid of a retail sales tax and a business transfer tax, during the week of October 17.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sandwiched in-between this news is some obligatory blah, blah, blah about Katrina, which seems to be unrelated to this story.  This is a hybrid tax given that both consumption and business profits will be taxed.  But if the tax rate is only 8.5%, just imagine how large the deficit will become if we eliminate the Federal income tax.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200510050834.asp">John Tamny</a> continues the National Review’s gold bug obsession:<br />
<blockquote>In 1898 Knut Wicksell said there was “no need to waste words proving how important it is that the exchange value of money or, what is the same thing seen from the opposite angle, the general level of commodity prices, remains as stable and constant as possible.” … Importantly, Wicksell’s currency-stability approach did not just rely on the value of the home currency (in his case, the Swedish Kronar) against others. Foreign exchange values were but one factor in his price-rule model.</p></blockquote>
<p>1898?  Is Tamny referring to <em>Interest and Prices </em>where Wicksell also wrote:<br />
<blockquote>In passing, there is a point to be noticed. The growth in the use of money, and the increase in monetary stocks, tends more and more to reduce the significance of the commodity characteristics of money. On the other hand, the development of the monetary system results in a displacement of specie by credit instruments and so-called money substitutes, and there exists, therefore, an important tendency towards a strengthening of the commodity aspect of money and of its influence on prices.  It is sometimes said to be feasible to base a monetary system upon gold and yet to dispense entirely, or almost entirely, with the employment of gold both in circulation and in the banks’ reserves. This would be done by extending the use of cheques, by the issue of notes of which the cover is of a purely banking nature, and so on. This view, which is held by some of the most prominent writers on monetary questions, must be regarded as utopian. In such a system the value of money would be directly exposed to the effects of every fortuitous incident on the side of the production of the precious metal and every caprice on the side of its consumption. It would undergo the same violent fluctuations as do the values of most other commodities. But it would be quite possible to maintain a stable value of money without the use of reserves of a precious metal. Only it would be necessary for the metal to cease to serve as a standard of value. </p></blockquote>
<p>So Wicksell noted that a commodity-based monetary system could exhibit instability and that a stable value of money was possible even without a commodity-based monetary system.</p>

<blockquote>Storms Show A System Out Of Balance<br />GOP Congress Has Reduced Usual Diet of Agency Oversight</p>
<p>Congress&#8230; has had little appetite in recent years for executive branch oversight. And now, as lawmakers probe FEMA&#8217;s mistakes in responding to Katrina, they are waking up to the consequences of neglect.</p>
<p>Government scholars and watchdog groups say the decline of congressional oversight in recent years has thrown out of kilter the system of checks and balances the Founding Fathers created to keep no one branch of government from becoming too powerful. </p>
<p>&#8230;Norman J. Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, has a harsher assessment. &#8220;This Congress doesn&#8217;t see itself as an independent branch that might include criticizing an incumbent administration. Meaningful oversight, because it might imply criticism, has been pushed off the table altogether.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While this is a trend that has been going on for quite some time, it has certainly become more pronounced during this decade.  I think that three key ingredients have combined to stengthen this phenomenon:
<ul>
<li>The same party is in control of both the executive and legislative branches of government;</li>
<li>That party has a strong, centralized leadership to which the rank-and-file defer; </li>
<li>The leadership of that party has often seemed to be more concerned with party loyalty than with ensuring a well-functioning government.</li>
</ul>
<p>Put these together, and you&#8217;ve created an environment in which government incompetence is allowed to fester and spread, with no fear of accountability.</p>

                                <p>Back in August, I somewhat <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/08/hey-angry-bear.html">tepidly endorsed</a> John Roberts:<br />
<blockquote>Is Roberts really such a bad nominee? His record of arguing before the USSC, plus a bit of time as an appelate court judge, seem to make him well-qualified. And at least by Owen and Rogers-Brown standards, he&#8217;s not a giant nutbag.</p></blockquote>
<p>My thinking at the time was that, for better or worse, he was and is fully qualified to be a Supreme Court Justice. While I expect to disagree with many or most of his views, this is a democracy, Republicans control the Senate and the White House, and so absent turpitude or lack of qualifications, there&#8217;s not much in the way of grounds for opposition.</p>
<p>Simply put, Roberts was an instance of views with which I disagree, but a background and intellect that are impressive.</p>
<p>Now I face the exact opposite scenario: a background and intellect that seem to fall short of Supreme Court standards(*), but views that I <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_10/007258.php">may</a>  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_10/007251.php">well</a> <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001655.html">find</a> <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/wp-print.php?p=5434">less</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_10/007256.php">objectionable</a> than Roberts&#8217;. If I am to be consistent, do I oppose or not oppose Miers? I&#8217;m leaning towards the former.</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>(*) To be perfectly clear, I do not mean that Miers&#8217; background and intellect are sub-par in any traditional sense. In fact, I&#8217;m <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2005/10/03/harriet-the-justice/">with Kieran</a> &#8212; most likely, she is a very &#8220;competent and probably a pretty tough person.&#8221; However, she has <a href="http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/faculty/2005/10/evaluating_supr.html">no time on the bench, no discernible background in constitutional law, and no record</a> (e.g., publications) of spending much time contemplating constitutional law.</p>
<p>UPDATE: As a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003/06/dueling-quotes-on-libertarians-i.html">longtime fan</a> of the The Federalist Papers, I&#8217;m enjoying an on-point excerpt from <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/funddocs/fed/federa76.htm">Federalist #76</a> (Alexander Hamilton) that&#8217;s <a href="http://lsolum.blogspot.com/archives/2005_10_01_lsolum_archive.html#112834852634675411">making the rounds</a>:<br />
<blockquote>To what purpose then require the co-operation of the Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity. In addition to this, it would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration.</p>
<p>It will readily be comprehended, that a man who had himself the sole disposition of offices, would be governed much more by his private inclinations and interests, than when he was bound to submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a different and independent body, and that body an entier branch of the legislature. The possibility of rejection would be a strong motive to care in proposing. The danger to his own reputation, and, in the case of an elective magistrate, to his political existence, from betraying a spirit of favoritism, or an unbecoming pursuit of popularity, to the observation of a body whose opinion would have great weight in forming that of the public, could not fail to operate as a barrier to the one and to the other. He would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward, for the most distinguished or lucrative stations, candidates who had no other merit than that of coming from the same State to which he particularly belonged, or of being in some way or other personally allied to him, or of possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure.<u></u></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>NEW YORK (CNN/Money) &#8211; Some of the billions in windfall profits going to overseas oil producers are coming back to the United States in the form of foreign investment, according to a published report. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that oil exporters like Saudi Arabia are saving and investing far more and spending far less than they did in earlier oil booms. And the newspaper says that the oil money being invested in U.S. assets are helping to keep long-term interest rates in check here, despite the steady pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. </p></blockquote>
<p>Followers of <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/102473">Brad Setser</a> realized that the Saudis  as well as other nations are saving in part by accumulating U.S. assets – with Brad lately noting:<br />
<blockquote>Savings has been outsourced to the poorest countries.  And their central banks play a huge role in the global flow of funds. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>Is the Club for Growth endorsing corruption?  In their <a href="http://www.clubforgrowth.org/blog">Tempers Flare in Red China</a>, this club for rich people questions the intent of the Chinese government as expressed in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/30/AR2005093000495_pf.html">this story</a>: <br />
<blockquote>After 20 years of opening and reform, China has now come to a key stage of development,&#8221; said Ye Duchu, a professor at the Central Party School for up-and-coming functionaries, in a recent interview with Southern Weekend newspaper. &#8220;Problems like the income gap, the rural-urban gap, corruption and so on, have begun to emerge quickly. How to solve these problems and eliminate inharmonious factors now seem crucial to China&#8217;s opening process.&#8221; Study Times, the party school&#8217;s official organ, warned last week that the alliance between party and business, often greased by corruption, itself is a big reason for the income inequality that has farmers so upset. Citing a study published by the Labor and Social Security Ministry, the paper said incomes gaps have reached &#8220;the yellow light alarm level&#8221; and within five years could reach a &#8220;dangerous red light level&#8221; that could result in &#8220;destabilizing social phenomena&#8221; unless something is done to change the trend.</p></blockquote>
<p>The only two things about the intent of Chinese policy that this story told us are: (1) that the government is properly concerned about income inequality and (2) that the government is properly concerned about corruption in the market place.  For this, the Club for Growth fires off:<br />
<blockquote>the communist Chinese government is going to be more, well…communistic</p></blockquote>
<p>They give a hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/10/putting_the_gin.html">Mark Thoma</a> even if it appears that they failed to read his post.  I did and commented that the U.S. distribution of income is about as uneven as China’s, and Mark kindly reminded me to look at the graph in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">this link</a>, which has a nice picture of Gini coefficients in different nations around the globe.  Memo to self: checking with Wikipedia saves the trouble of checking with the CIA World Factbook. Memo to the Club for Growth: we can have free markets without corruption and caring about income equality is not solely a Communist ideal.</p>

                                <p>While the <a href="http://financialrounds.blogspot.com/2005/10/more-on-frist-and-insider-trading.html">Unknown Professor</a> may have a more favorable view of how <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/does-andrew-mccarthy-of-nro-understand.html">Andrew McCarthy</a> interpreted this <a href="http://users1.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?a=t&#038;d=wsj&#038;sd=users1&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB112812875003657485.html">Wall Street Journal</a> story than I did, I agree with his statement:<br />
<blockquote>While a violation of insider trading laws requires a number of criteria to be met … at the minimum it requires that an insider initiate the trades due to his possession of &#8220;material non-public information&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>As <a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/">Duncan Black</a> checks out the <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9558504/site/newsweek">Newsweek</a> coverage, he adds:<br />
<blockquote>It doesn&#8217;t matter how long before the official earnings announcement Frist asked to sell the stock, at least as long as it&#8217;s measured in months and not years. The only issue is whether he was illegally acting on inside information. </p></blockquote>
<p>Duncan says he is a recovering economist and he sees my point, whereas the Unknown Professor is professor of finance and he seems to be siding with Mr. McCarthy.  As I read the Unknown Professor’s comments under my post, I sense that I owe the readers of Angrybear a bit of an elaboration that starts with the recent history of <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=HCA&#038;t=1y&#038;l=on&#038;z=m&#038;q=l&#038;c=">HCA’s stock price</a>, which the professor described as he took care of his two kids.</p>
<p>One key to this issue is did what did the insiders know when they sold their shares that the public did not know until just before the stock price dropped from around $55 to $50. As the title of my post was motivated by this <a href="http://pda.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/sep2005/nf20050923_9227_db016.htm">Business Week</a> article, the other question is when did they know it.  If they knew of some material information that was not shared with the public until July back before April 29, then the Wall Street Journal story is not a defense for Senator Frist.  </p>
<p>What I find interesting is the jump in HCA’s stock price from around $50 to $55 in early April.  What piece of news drove that increase?  Is this news in any way related to the disappointing information learned in July?  For example, was there some potentially good news that was known by the public with some offsetting or qualifying information that only the insiders knew about until July?  I’m sure the well trained economists at the SEC will be looking into such matters if political pressures don’t impede their inquiry, which of course, was the real point of the Newsweek article that Duncan criticized on one small point:<br />
<blockquote>The SEC is trying to show politics won&#8217;t play into its scrutiny of a stock sale by Sen. Bill Frist. Easier said than done.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I pose these questions, I’ll confess that I don’t know the answers to them.  Given his interests in this topic and his ability to articulate how the principles of finance apply to such interesting real world discussions, I’m checking out the Unknown Professor’s <a href="http://financialrounds.blogspot.com/">blog</a> more often.</p>

                                <p>The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) <a href="http://www.mortgagebankers.org/news/2005/wk0928.asp">reports</a> that the starter rate for the one year Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) is now over 5% for the first time since early 2002.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/rates1.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/rates1.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>The above chart uses the month end rates as reported by the MBA. Interest rates bottomed in May/June 2003 and the ARM has been rising steadily for the last two years. The interest rate on a 30 year fixed rate loan has increased at a slower rate than the ARM (part of Greenspan&#8217;s conundrum).</p>
<p>The rising rates have not slowed the housing market &#8211; yet. Since interest rates bottomed in Q2 2003, house prices have increased 15.2% nationwide according to the OFHEO (stated in real terms, adjusted for inflation using CPI less shelter). San Diego&#8217;s prices have increased 39.5% and Miami 35% in real terms over that 2 year period.  Even with rising rates, house price appreciation has exceeded historical norms.</p>
<p>Note: All gains are from the end of June &#8217;03 through June &#8217;05.</p>
<p>There are signs that transaction volumes for housing may have peaked.  New home sales declined in August (the most recent report), but volumes are still near record levels.  It will take several months to determine if the trend has changed (see Katrina note below).  However housing inventories, for both existing and new homes, have been increasing for some time.  New home inventories are at record levels and existing home inventories are at the highest level since the early &#8217;90s housing bust.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/newhomeinvent.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/newhomeinvent.jpg"></a><br />New Home inventories continue to rise.</p>
<p>I believe that the housing cycle has peaked and rising mortgage rates will only accelerate the coming slowdown.  The sequence will probably be: rising inventories, followed by declining transaction volumes and finally falling prices. </p>

<p>Even if housing prices just flatten, there are potential problems for the economy: see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/02libank.html">My House, My Piggy Bank</a>.  Fleckenstein on housing: <a href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/P131154.asp">Empty houses, falling prices: A boom dies</a>.  And from BusinessWeek: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/oct2005/nf2005103_2711_db035.htm">If Housing Slumps, How Safe Are You?</a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;If real estate cools dramatically, there goes half our economic growth,&#8221; says Barry Ritholtz, chief market strategist at Maxim Group. &#8220;There is danger of recession &#8230;&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>  On Katrina:  Some observers, like <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/">Ritholtz</a>, are concerned that the &#8220;Fog of Katrina&#8221; might obscure an already slowing economy and lead the FED to raise rates too far.  As an example, housing data may be skewed by the reconstruction in the gulf.  From the Census Bureau: <a href="http://www.census.gov/const/www/August2005faq.pdf">Questions on Katrina</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q: Will completely rebuilt houses be counted as a new house being built?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the definition of a new housing start was modified to include structures where the entire building was razed and a new house was built on the existing foundation. We plan to work with local jurisdictions in the affected states to assist in the proper classification of the permits for the units being rebuilt.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The weekend edition of the Wall Street Journal (subscription required) indicates that Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist appears to have a very good defense to suspicions about whether he traded on inside information in selling his HCA stock. Specifically, there is a paper trail showing he set his stock sales in motion long before there was a public warning about earnings expectations. </p></blockquote>
<p>If the information that insiders knew were publically available, it would not be insider information.</p>
