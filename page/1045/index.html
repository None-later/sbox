                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Following up on yesterday’s post about the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/explaining-capital-flow-puzzle.html">capital flow puzzle</a>, I thought I’d examine savings and consumption patterns more closely, since differences in savings behavior are (as I argued) the crucial determinants of the odd pattern that we currently see wherein poor countries are lending vast sums of money to the wealthy United States.  The table below presents a snapshot of the tremendous disparities in savings and consumption behavior between developing Asian economies and the US.  All data is for 2003 unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/savings_comparisons-707769.jpg"><br />Notes: Japan gross savings data for 2002; China household savings data from 2000.<br />Sources: Gross savings rates from OECD and ADB; household saving rates from OECD and sundry national statistics agencies; consumption and CA balances from IMF.</p>
<p>Rates of gross national saving – which include saving by households, firms, and the government – are double or triple the US rate in most of the countries in the table.  Generally, much of the difference is accounted for by higher rates of savings by households.  (Note that it is surprisingly difficult to come by household savings data for developing countries; I’d appreciate any data tips to help fill in my table.)</p>
<p>Another way of looking at the same thing is to examine how much consumption spending each country does.  Unsurprisingly, the US leads the pack when it comes to consuming; by contrast, several Asian countries have extremely low rates of consumption spending.  As I mentioned in yesterday’s post, the problem in Asia is too little consumption, if anything.  </p>
<p>The last column in the table shows the effect of these divergent savings and consumption patterns: net international borrowing or lending, or the current account balance.  Nearly every country in the world right now is a net lender, with almost all of those funds going to the US.</p>
<p>What explains these dramatic differences in savings and consumption patterns?  It turns out that there&#8217;s no consensus on a single answer.  Numerous possibilities have been examined in the literature to explain different savings rates across countries (see <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/research/projects/savings/pdffiles/PrivSav.pdf">this World Bank paper</a> for an example of a fairly thorough overview), including income levels and growth rates, financial sector development, credit constraints, fiscal policy, and pension institutions.  Needless to say, different explanations seem to work for different countries at different times, and savings differences are usually due to a combination of several factors.</p>
<p>But my favorite theory, at least in this case, is that the high rate of saving in many Asian economies is primarily due to the inertia of consumption spending.  </p>
<p>It is an increasingly well-established empirical fact that consumption displays a great deal of inertia – people’s consumption habits only change slowly, even when their income rises or falls dramatically.  If a country is experiencing rapid economic growth, this could well explain why savings rates are high in those countries: households’ consumption has not yet caught up to their increased income, so they save the difference.  Of course, to some degree the causation may run the other way (i.e. higher savings may lead to faster growth), but the evidence seems to suggest that the primary direction of causation is from higher growth to higher savings.</p>
<p>This helps to explain why some of the fastest growing economies like China have some of the highest savings rates.  It might also help to explain why Japan, which has experienced a dramatic slowdown in growth over the past 10 years, has also experienced a dramatic fall in its household savings rate over the same period of time, from about 15% in 1990 to about 7% today.</p>
<p>At any rate, the upshot is that the US will continue to borrow from the rest of the world until it starts to save more, or households around the world start to consume more of their income.  So the real question then becomes this: what will make either of those things happen?</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a pay raise,&#8221; said House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas. &#8220;It&#8217;s an adjustment so that they&#8217;re not losing their purchasing power.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Congressman is exactly right as the percentage increase in nominal pay is less than 2%.  And yet we hear so many GOP leaders trying to claim that nominal increases that are less than the increase in the cost of living represent benefit increases rather than cuts.</p>

                                <p>I think I have to disagree with <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/06/glenn_hubbard_o.html">Brad DeLong’s assessment</a> of Glenn Hubbard’s <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB111948540986467092,00-search.html?KEYWORDS=Hubbard&#038;COLLECTION=wsjie/archive">WSJ op-ed</a> from the other day.  Brad suggests that Hubbard may indeed have identified an important piece of the puzzle – the puzzle being why poor Asian economies are lending so much money to the United States.  </p>
<p>Hubbard’s point boils down to this: China and other developing Asian economies are investing large quantities of money in the US because they don’t have good investment opportunities at home.  That&#8217;s not because the domestic rates of return are no good, but because bad domestic institutions make domestic investment opportunities risky.  In other words, the risk-return ratio is better in the US.</p>
<p>But I don’t think this explains today’s pattern of international capital flows.  I agree that corrupt and inefficient domestic institutions in many developing countries are major impediments to growth.  And there are lots of examples where citizens have sent their savings overseas because they were worried about losing it if they kept it in domestic assets.  (Think about many Latin American countries during the 1980s, or most of Africa during the last 50 years, for examples.)  </p>
<p>But Asia today does not fit this story.</p>
<p>There are two reasons that I say this.  First, the agents that are actually buying the assets in the US are not private individuals in Asian countries, but rather Asian central banks.  And we’re reasonably certain that the reason they’re buying US assets is not because they’re seeking the highest or most risk-free return, but rather because they are trying to manage their exchange rate.  There’s scant evidence that private individuals in Asian countries are fleeing to foreign assets because they don’t trust their domestic institutions.</p>
<p>Second, the surplus of funds in Asia stems not from an insufficiency of domestic business investment, but rather from an insufficiency of private consumption.  Investment spending in countries like China is, if anything, too high &#8211; in China it&#8217;s currently running at over 40% of GDP, compared to less than 20% in the US.  Apparently, individuals and firms see plenty of good investment opportunities in China and other developing Asian economies, and are willing to put money into them.</p>
<p>The problem is that private savings rates are also extraordinarily high in those countries.  Furthermore, while such high savings rates are found in countries with questionable institutions, like China, they are also found in countries with impeccable financial credentials, like Singapore.  So I don&#8217;t believe that weak domestic institutions are what is causing households in a wide variety of Asian countries to decide to save their income rather than spend it.</p>
<p>No, I think that we must look elsewhere to explain the bizarre pattern of poor developing countries (along with many rich countries) lending vast sums of money to the US.  Note that the two things that make this pattern possible right now are (1) the fact that the US is living far beyond its means, and borrowing the difference (both at the private and governmental levels); and (2) the fact that households in  developing countries like China are saving rather than spending their income.  So if you want to explain the pattern of international capital flows today, I think you need to explain facts #1 and #2.  I don’t think Hubbard’s story explains either of them.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.duke.edu/~meh13">Michael Hoffman</a> forwarded to us an interesting short <a href="http://www.duke.edu/~meh13/exchangerate-tradedeficit.pdf">paper</a> showing the lack of an empirical relationship between the exchange rate and the current account.  He summarizes the underlying theoretical construct as two conventional claims:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) A cheap (depreciated) dollar causes the current account deficit to shrink.<br />(2) A current account deficit causes the dollar to depreciate.</p></blockquote>
<p>My reply to him was simply the following shorter version:</p>
<blockquote><p>Net exports are a function of real exchange rates and other factors, while real exchange rates are also an endogenous variable.  It is well established that correlations between endogenous variables tell us little about the underlying structural relationships.  </p></blockquote>
<p>I wish to thank Michael for this contribution and hope our readers enjoy it.</p>

                                <p>I wish to amend for two errors of omission in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/andrew-roth-lawrence-hunter-explain.html">this post</a>.   The first was not mentioning the same day op-ed from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/pfeiffer/pfeiffer200506230750.asp">Eric Pfeiffer</a>.  While I disagree with much of what Mr. Pfeiffer wrote, I appreciate the fact that his definition of the Social Security surplus included interest income.  The second was my failure to mention that Lawrence Hunter’s coauthor was Phil Kerpen who also wrote <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/kerpen200506280918.asp">this op-ed</a>.  </p>
<p>While Hunter-Kerpen omitted the Trust Fund’s interest income, Kerpen now shows the impact of including the interest income.  Alas, Kerpen is not officially conceding that Hunter-Kerpen erred. Instead, he is saying that an analysis the DeMint plan should exclude this income as if DeMint is implicitly proposing to default on the accumulated bonds in that file drawer.  If that is what Senator DeMint is really suggesting, then I can understand how his proposal would reduce the General Fund problem – by diverting assets and the associated interest from the Social Security Trust Fund, which would implicitly be either a benefit cut its proponents do not admit to or a move that would increase any alleged insolvency issue.</p>
<p>We have seen lots of this kind of bait-and-switch accounting from the privatization crowd.  Of course, we have seen lots of bait-and-switch discussions on asset returns such as what we discussed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/kudlow-on-value-of-bonds-in-soc-sec.html">yesterday</a>.  I’m sure Mr. Kudlow knows that a 9% nominal return is not superior to a 3% real return if inflation is 6%.  Alas, the writing from the free lunch crowd seems to be based on the premise that their readers do not know the difference.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: Phil Kerpen emailed me asking me to take a look at the document labeled “Stop the Raid – Start the Accounts…Without Adding to the Deficits”, which can be found <a href="http://freeenterprisefund.org/policy.php?polid=2">here</a>.  Notice this document begins by saying the Social Security surpluses are only $69 billion per year, which excludes the interest income.  Mr. Kerpen says the DeMint proposal would not include the current Trust Fund assets, which basically means DeMint is proposing to worsen the solvency issue – not improve it.  Also note that this document is proposing to reduce government spending by over $140 billion per year.  It’s fine for a private citizen to HOPE the GOP led Federal government would be so fiscally responsible – but there is no evidence that President Bush and the House leadership has any intent to follow these proposals.</p>

                                <p>On occasion, <a href="http://www.socialsecuritychoice.org/">Lawrence Kudlow</a> produces an interesting tidbit of information.  Take the chart at the bottom of his “Stop the Raids, Start the Accounts”, which shows the total nominal return one would have earned on ten-year Treasury bonds had one invested $1000 in 1977.  While the amount of nominal wealth as of 2002 looks very impressive, one should realize that the increase in real wealth would have been less.  </p>
<p>Kudlow writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The accounts would create ownership and much higher retirement investment returns than the current system will provide. Over the very long run Jeremy Siegel’s work shows about a 5 percent annual return for Treasury bonds. Interestingly, since 1977 that return has climbed to nearly 9 percent yearly. Of course these are risk-free bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. It’s a great way to start personal savings accounts. Under current law Social Security surpluses are exchanged for non-marketable Treasuries placed in the Social Security Administration account. The Supreme Court has ruled that we don’t own them. However, by placing marketable Treasuries in a personal IRA we will own them and we will get a better yield for retirement.</p></blockquote>
<p>His odd appeal to the <em>Flemming v. Nestor </em>canard notwithstanding, the bonds in the Social Security Trust Fund earn the same return as marketable bonds held by the public – and they have the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.  So any claim of a “better yield” just does not square with the facts.  </p>
<p>Even if Kudlow confuses nominal return with real return (which seems to be his norm), his chart does suggest that the bonds in the current Trust Fund are accumulating value, which is something his Club for Growth colleagues are trying to deny.</p>

                                <p>Is it “Dishonest Dick” or “Deferment Dick”?  I’ll spare you my sermon on how Cheney smeared Senator Hagel as <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/6/26/18480/0163">Kos</a> covers this perfectly.  Kos is rightfully frustrated with this write-up from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/06/23/cheney.interview/index.html">CNN</a> but note this sentence about the detainees at Guantanamo Bay:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They&#8217;re living in the tropics. They&#8217;re well fed. They&#8217;ve got everything they could possibly want,&#8221; the vice president said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The same sentence appears in <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8357196/">this story</a> along with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The House delegation ate lunch with troops &#8211; the same meal of chicken with orange sauce, rice and okra that detainees were served.</p></blockquote>
<p>I really do not get the point of the second story – of course our Congressional delegation saw no prisoner abuse during their scheduled visit.  And it seems that the stories about Gourmet Gitmo all involve some recipe for chicken.  Is Gourmet Gitmo using a cookbook from the former wife of <a href="http://www.thebaseballpage.com/past/pp/boggswade">Wade Boggs</a>.  Since Mr. Boggs rewarded his clever wife by abandoning her, maybe the DoD should pay her royalties for the use of her recipes.  In the meantime, let’s stop all this nonsense that the detainees are living the good life.  Hopefully, all instances of abuse have ceased but to pretend prison is a tropical vacation is just silly.</p>

                                <p>Some have suggested that the recent surge in home prices could be explained by the drop in interest rates. Recently Dr. Rosen, Senior Economist at the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, made this argument in a Fed Letter &#8220;<a href="http://www.chicagofed.org/publications/fedletter/cfljuly2005_216.pdf">Explaining recent changes in home prices</a>&#8220;. UCSD Economics Professor Dr. Hamilton, of Econobrowser, <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/06/what_is_a_bubbl.html">suggested</a> another possible interest rate based model for home prices.</p>
<p>When these models are back tested to older housing data they appear to fail. Historically there are periods of concurrently rising interest rates and home prices and periods of falling interest rates and falling home prices. Does this mean that buyers were making irrational decisions during those prior periods?  Or are the interest rate based models flawed.  The answer may shock some people: Historically interest rates have been largely irrelevant to the price of a house.</p>
<p><strong>An Automobile Example</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you are going to purchase a new car that typically sells for $30 thousand. Maybe you are going to finance the car; maybe you are going to pay cash. Now suppose the dealer offers you a lower financing package. Would you be willing to pay more for the car? If you still decide to pay cash, you wouldn&#8217;t pay more. And if you decide to take the financing you will pocket the savings, buy a nicer car, or add more features.</p>
<p>The interest rate is irrelevant to what you are willing to pay for a particular car.  The same is true for housing.</p>
<p>But the lower interest rate does indirectly have a small impact on pricing, not because it lowers the monthly payment, but because it increases demand.  The lower financing package will attract some potential buyers of less expensive cars to move up. It will also make new cars more attractive to some used car buyers. So the more attractive financing will probably increase the demand for the $30K car and that might increase the price slightly.</p>
<p>Some renters might decide to buy a home due to lower financing costs, just like the example of some used car buyers purchasing a new car. In fact, according to the Census Bureau, the number of American households renting decreased by 1.4 million from 2001 to early 2004. These households have migrated to homeownership probably because of the lower interest rates.  During the same time period over 800K apartment units were removed from the market (probably mostly condo conversions) so the actual increase in demand was about 200K units per year.  </p>
<p>The supply curve for housing is fairly steep so it seems reasonable that the temporary additional demand contributed to the initial increase in home prices.  The home builders responded to this surge in demand by adding more construction.  And, according to the census bureau, the migration from renting to buying ended over a year ago.  Now there appears to be more than adequate supply of new homes and the demand has returned to normal.  So why haven&#8217;t prices flattened out or even decreased?</p>
<p><strong>A Bubble Model</strong></p>
<p>A couple of months ago I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/housing-speculation-is-key.html">suggested</a> a model of how speculation was causing the housing bubble.  The surge in homeownership demand from renters contributed to the initial price increase.  Then speculators started chasing the appreciating assets leading to even higher prices and more speculation.  I suggested there were two types of speculation: Speculation as storage and excessive leverage as speculation.  Buyers that only consider the monthly costs are using excessive leverage, speculating that the price will continue to increase into the future.</p>
<p>My automobile example suggests that what people are willing to pay is more likely based on their household income than their monthly payments.  We can test this hypothesis: here is a graph of household income vs. house prices since 1976:</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/IncomeHouse.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/IncomeHouse.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>House prices are from the OFHEO <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/HPIRegion.asp">House Price Index</a>. Household Income is the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h01ar.html">60% percentile</a> income from the Census Bureau.  The Census data is not available for 2004.</p>
<p>Sure enough, historically house prices have correlated well with household income.  Two previous housing bubbles, the early &#8217;80s and the early to mid &#8217;90s, are clearly shown on the graph.  It took several years to unwind the early &#8217;90s bubble (see: <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/housing-after-boom.html">Housing After the Boom</a> for a short review of the &#8217;90s bust).</p>
<p>UPDATE: My initial graph was to intended to show that housing prices move with household income (as opposed to interest rates).  This additional graph shows the ratio between house prices (1976 = 1) and household income (1976 = 1).  If this is a measure of a &#8220;housing bubble&#8221;, then this graph shows the relative sizes of the previous housing bubbles (early &#8217;80s and early to mid &#8217;90s) compared to today.  </p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/Ratio.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/Ratio.jpg"></a></p>
<p>BACK TO ORIGINAL POST:</p>
<p>Any house price model would have to detect the housing bubbles of the early &#8217;80s and early &#8217;90s.  It appears that models based on interest rates fail, whereas housing price models based on actually fundamentals like household income are historically better predictors of house prices.</p>
<p><strong>Future question: Who are the Bagholders?</strong></p>
<p>Professor Hamilton asks this question, If there is a housing bubble, &#8220;[W]hy are banks making loans to people who aren&#8217;t going to be able to pay them back?&#8221;  This is a very interesting question about market failure and moral hazard.  Will it be the American taxpayers again left holding the empty bag like in the S&#038;L crisis?  I will speculate on the answer in the near future &#8211; suggestions are welcome!  Along these lines, from John Maynard Keynes:<br />
<blockquote><em>&#8220;A sound banker, alas, is not one who foresees danger and avoids it, but one who, when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional way along with his fellows, so that no one can really blame him.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>  John Maynard Keynes, &#8220;Consequences to the Banks of a Collapse in Money Values&#8221;, 1931</p>
<p>Finally, my friend Mike Shedlock is hearing &#8220;<a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2005/06/warning-bells-from-homebuilder.html">Warning bells from homebuilder suppliers</a>&#8220;.   </p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200506240838.asp">John Tamny</a> claims that 10-year Federal bonds are overvalued in what may be the oddest NRO oped on record.  It is true that the recent decline in long-term interest rates is a conundrum, but the market price for bonds is readily explained by its payout structure over its term compared to market yields on similar bonds.  For example – if a 10-year bond is issued today promising to pay $4 per year for 10 years place a face value of $100 at the end of the term and if market yields today are 4%, then this bond’s price today would equal $100.  If market yields in a week decline, the market price of this bond will increase.  Tamny not only suggests Treasury bonds are overvalued, but he also tries to suggest there is some tie to the price of gold, which I simply do not get.  </p>
<p>You might prefer to check out the op-ed from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/carter200506240838.asp">Edward Carter</a> as to what it concedes.  Carter admits that government spending during the first term of President Bush did not decline from 18% of GDP to 16.6% of GDP but actually increased as a share of GDP.  He also concedes that tax revenues declined as a share of GDP.  Yet Carter wants us to believe that fiscal policy will be much more responsible during Bush’s second term.  Again, the reasoning for this claim is something I simply do not get.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Let’s compare Carter’s statement “All it required was holding the average real growth rate of federal spending at 1.2 percent a year through 2006” to what President Bush said on February 27, 2001: “We&#8217;ve increased spending for discretionary programs by a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate of inflation”. If real Federal spending grew by 4% per year, the spending to GDP ratio would increase – not decline.  But one could read this sentence they way Trent Lott did the morning after this State of the Union Address: 4% nominal increase translated into a 1% real increase assuming 3% inflation.  But Bush was referring to discretionary spending – not total spending.  So it seems the bait-and-switch was on from the very beginning of Bush’s Presidency.</p>
<p><em>Update II</em>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200506270902.asp">Michael Darda</a> goes far beyond the claims of Mr. Carter arguing that the Bush tax cuts will increase long-term growth rates by 0.85%.  His evidence seems to be some unidentified analysis:</p>
<blockquote><p>A dynamic analysis of the Bush tax cuts shows that long-run growth could be lifted by 0.85 percentage points as long as the lower-tax schedules on capital and labor remain in place. Ceteris paribus, an additional 0.85 percentage points of growth would augment revenues by $1.5 trillion during the next decade. The rebound in real economic growth since 2003 also suggests the fiscal deficit should fall to no more than 2 percent of GDP during the next year, less than the historical average going back to 1960. </p></blockquote>
<p>If anyone has a copy of this alleged analysis, let us know.</p>

Dr. Hubbard also seems to have freed himself from having to defend the long-term fiscal stimulus of the Bush Administration:</p>
<blockquote><p>The rise in the global saving rate is more than accounted for by a higher saving rate in emerging economies, particularly in Asia. I say &#8220;more than accounted for&#8221; because the U.S., the world&#8217;s largest economy, reduced its national saving over the same period.</p></blockquote>
