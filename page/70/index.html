                                <p>Angry Bear has had a history of disagreement with Megan McArdle via her Atlantic magazine posts (starting in 2007), at one point being called <i>Mike and his merry madmen</i> in print by Megan McArdle (in exasperation?).  Still. the madmen included Mike, Dan Crawford, Spencer England, Ken Houghton, Robert Waldmann, and other notables brought in to help.  I will have a history up later when I can sort them out.  </p>
<p>It is with feeling some real vindication publicly when I saw <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/09/project-s-h-a-m-e-on-megan-mcardle-portrait-of-a-taxpayer-subsidized-libertarian.html" target="_blank">Yves Smith</a> post an entire column from <a href="http://shameproject.com/" target="_blank">Project Shame</a> on Megan McArdle well worth reading.  It begins:<br />
<blockquote>Megan McArdle is a Koch-trained conservative activist working as a business journalist and pundit. She earned her MBA from the University of Chicago, received journalism training at the Kochs’ flagship libertarian think-tank, the Institute for Humane Studies, and has used her position at The Atlantic and, most recently, Newsweek/The Daily Beast, to run cover for and promote Koch interests and the Republican Party agenda. In early 2009, a GOP outfit backed by the Kochs hailed McArdle for her “leadership role in … re-branding the Republican party.” McArdle continues to conceal the extent of her deeply conflicted relationships with the Koch influence-peddling machine.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>
<div>Earlier this week, before the, um, video-recording news broke, it was reported that Romney planned to bring one of those debt clocks to his campaign rallies.  Hmmm, I thought; Obama should return the favor; he should bring a debt clock to his own rallies. A clock that shows what the debt will be under Romney’s “I’ll cut taxes by 20%, and then I’ll cut them more, and then I’ll …”, as he told the Detroit Economic Club last February. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Or maybe Obama should take two debt clocks to his rallies: one showing the likely debt under Romney’s plan, the other showing the projected debt under the Ryan serious-about-debt-reduction plan.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sounds like a (campaign) plan, to me!
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But, of course, now that the video-recording news <i>has</i> broken, Republicans are scrambling to figure out how Romney can salvage his campaign.  The solution?  Turn it into a <i>plus</i> by illustrating how unmanageable the debt will become—and how awful it will be for later generations to have to handle—if we don’t get entitlements under control!  Y’know, by reversing the savings in Medicare under Obamacare!  And by reducing by 205, rather than raising to Clinton-G.H.W. Bush levels, income tax rates on people with incomes above $250,000!
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yup.  Conservative Washington Post columnist Robert J. Samuelson* uses <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-j-samuelson-romney-and-the-welfare-state/2012/09/19/14324ce2-0281-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_story.html?hpid=z3">his column today</a> to join that chorus.  He urges Romney to turn that video-recording lemon into lemonade by claiming that what he (Romney) really meant when <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/republicans-bad-gets-worse-romney-225708062--election.html">he said</a> he knows “some believe that government should take from some to give to the others,” and that he thinks “that&#8217;s an entirely foreign concept,” was that the 47% of people who make too little money to pay income taxes as the current tax code is structured should be required to pay income taxes in order to negate some of the revenue loss from the 20% reduction in the tax rate for people with incomes above $250,000, some with incomes <i>way</i> above $250,000.  Like Romney.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Er … I mean … he should turn the discussion into one that shows how serious a challenge it will be for younger generations of people who will take personal responsibility for themselves by forgoing, say, college-tuition loans because those loans no longer exist—oh, or by asking their parents to pay the tuition, and then to lend them the money to become entrepreneurs, like Tagg Romney—to pay down that national debt that by then will be trillions of dollars larger, courtesy of the Romney/Ryan income tax reductions.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sounds like a (campaign) plan, to me!  Go for it, Mitt!</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*CORRECTION:  Welllll, commenter rjs informed me that Samuelson is not an economist.  He just sorta masquerades as one.  Ooooops.  Sorry about my gullibility there, folks.</div>

                                <p>OK just to bring it all together, in Boca Raton Mitt Romney demonstrated that he didn&#8217;t know the very latest news about quantitative easing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/09/fed-really-buying-three-quarters-all-treasury-debt">Kevin Drum reads the transcript so we don&#8217;t have to</a></p>
<p>On May 17 2012<br />
<blockquote><strong>Romney:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting&#8230; the former head of Goldman Sachs, John Whitehead, was also the former head of the New York Federal Reserve. And I met with him, and he said as soon as the Fed stops buying all the debt that we&#8217;re issuing—which they&#8217;ve been doing, <em>the Fed&#8217;s buying like three-quarters of the debt that America issues</em>. He said, once that&#8217;s over, he said we&#8217;re going to have a failed Treasury auction, interest rates are going to have to go up.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is discussing QEII and how interest rates will shoot up when it ends.  It ended in July 2011.</p>
<p>Mitt Romney does not keep up with the latest news what monetary policy has been for the preceding 10 months.</p>

<div>My experience has taught me that government works best when it creates the space for individuals and families to pursue success and achieve great things. Economic freedom is the only force that has consistently succeeded in creating sustained prosperity and lifting people out of poverty. It is why our economy rose to rival those of the world&#8217;s leading powers &#8212; and has long since surpassed them all.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The dreamers and the entrepreneurs, not government, built this economy, and they can once again make it strong.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>My course for the American economy will encourage private investment and personal freedom. Instead of creating a web of dependency, I will pursue policies that grow our economy and lift Americans out of poverty.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>My five-point plan will deliver the economic recovery we&#8217;ve all been waiting for and the jobs millions of Americans still need. This can be more than our hope; it can be our future. And it can start this November with your vote.

<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/story/2012-09-18/Romney-47-recovery-dependency/57804214/1?csp=hf">Romney: I&#8217;ll deliver recovery, not dependency</a></i>, Mitt Romney, USA Today op-ed, today
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>
<div>Of all the many oddities of Romney’s cartoonish campaign and cartoonish campaign persona, the strangest, I think, is his penchant for stating loopy conclusions based upon a single fact that does not even conceivably support the conclusion.  This tactic (if that’s what it is) has been the hallmark, the very essence, of his campaign.  </div>
<p>
<div></div>
<div>Last week I questioned whether Romney was <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/is-romney-habitual-liar-or-is-he.html">a habitual liar or, instead, simply God-awful stupid</a>.  In light of the events of this week—the infamous surreptitiously-filmed fundraising address about the 47% of Americans whom Romney will never be able to convince should take personal responsibility for their lives and their care and who correlate precisely with the 47% of the electorate who are Obama supporters, and his “doubling down” on those comments since release of the video—I think it’s clear that while some of Romney’s incessant wild extrapolations and conflations are part of bizarre campaign tactic, some of the most important ones are not.  They are, rather, the result of jaw-dropping stupidity—an apparent genuine inability to understand the meaning of single facts and to distinguish between entirely separate concepts. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Not least of these, of course, is that Americans whose income is too low under the tax code for them to owe income tax necessarily don’t take personal responsibly for their lives and for their care, and that since the percentage of Americans who don’t pay income tax is about the same as the percentage of voters who, polls show, support Obama, virtually all people who don’t pay income taxes are Obama supporters, and virtually no Obama supporters pay income taxes.  Warren Buffett must have an income too low to require him to pay income taxes.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also not least is Romney’s inability to distinguish between a <i>plan</i>—specifics, supported by empirical evidence—and ideological clichés that consist entirely of generic declarations and supposed results.  Placing bullet-point indicators in front of five such declarations doesn’t transform them into a plan.  If he actually <i>has</i> a plan—specifics, supported by empirical evidence—then he should disclose it.  Economic plans are, after all, not tax returns, although it’s no longer surprising that Romney can’t distinguish the two.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But most disconcerting is Romney’s out-of-nowhere, patently false insistence, repeated time and again, that “our economy rose to rival those of the world&#8217;s leading powers &#8212; and … long since surpassed them all” during a period of <i>lower</i> taxes on the wealthy than we have now—a period of a <i>less</i>-progressive tax code and <i>more</i> inequality.  In other words, during a time when we had, according to him, <i>more</i> economic freedom, than we do now.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It’s long past time for the Obama campaign to educate the public about <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/romney-says-dwight-eisenhower-john-f.html">20<sup>th</sup> century American economic and political history</a>.  And to challenge Romney’s <i>intellectual</i> capacity to recognize what facts he needs to know before making important assertions, proposals and decisions, and to understand what those facts indicate or don’t.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Until very recently, I had presumed that Romney was only <i>pretending </i>to think that ideological bromides were actual facts.  I know better now.  And the most effective ads that the Obama campaign can run will show Romney for the intellectual lightweight that he is.  
</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>My lovely wife shared <a href="http://ed.msnbc.com/_news/2012/09/14/13865852-romney-thinks-250k-is-middle-income?threadId=3566072&#038;commentId=70055856#c70055856">this link</a> with me on Facebook.  I got into a discussion in comments there with a  right winger who suggested that $250,000 was a very reasonable estimate  for median income in Boston.</p>
<p>As it turns out, <a href="http://www.areavibes.com/boston-ma/employment/">median household income</a> in Boston is $51,914, close to the national average, and way below the  Mass. State average of $67,950.  But right wingers live in a data-free  world, so this is no surprise.</p>
<p>Another contention in  comments at that site is that the middle class is undefined and  undefinable. Not so.  I define middle class household income as the  middle quintile.  This range includes the median and a band around it  wide enough to hold 20 percent of the population.  You might wish to  concoct your own definition with a wider spread, but you&#8217;d better not be  asymmetric around the median.  Feel free to use the middle three  quintiles, if that is your preference.  But if your of concept of middle  class gets very far beyond 50% of the population, you really ought to  give more thought to what the word &#8220;middle&#8221; actually means.</p>
<p>Thinking about all this prompted a look at the various income quintiles.  The data, through 2009, is available at the <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/income_expenditures_poverty_wealth/household_income.html">Census Bureau web site</a>,  table 694.  This table provides historical data from 1967 through 2009  on the top income limit for the bottom 4 quintiles, and the bottom  income limit for the top 5%, expressed in constant 2009 dollars.</p>
<p>Graph  1 presents this data.  The 3rd quintile &#8211; my definition of the middle  class &#8211; is between the orange line and the yellow line.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pcXiiBoLVVU/UFUeGR2hgOI/AAAAAAAAB7A/4F-V4p4x7t0/s1600/Income+Quintiles.jpg"><img border="0" height="263" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pcXiiBoLVVU/UFUeGR2hgOI/AAAAAAAAB7A/4F-V4p4x7t0/s400/Income+Quintiles.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<p>In  1967, the threshold for the middle quintile was $32, 848.  By 2009, it  had increased by 17% to $38,550.  This is a compounded annual growth  rate of 0.38%</p>
<p>In 1967, the top limit for the middle  (and threshold to the 4th) quintile was $46, 621.  By 2009, it had  increased by 33% to $61,801. This is a compounded annual growth rate of  0.68%.</p>
<p>The threshold value for the fifth quintile  increased from $66,481 in 1967 by 80% to exactly $100,000 in 2009.  This  is a compounded annual growth rate of 0.98%.</p>
<p>To reach  the top 5% required an income of 106,684 in 1967.  By 2009, this had  increased by 69% to $180, 001.   This is a compounded annual growth rate  of 1.25%.</p>
<p>So my comment sparring partner and the  current presidential challenger he seems to support are a bit off base.   $250,000 in household income puts a family well above the 95th  percentile.  In fact, that is <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-20/top-2-not-job-creators-or-millionaires-in-tax-debate.html">just enough household income</a> to crack the top 2%.</p>
<p>My ongoing hobby of debunking right wing nonsense aside, the point of this post is mainly to inform.<br />There are two main observations:<br />1)  While the bottom two quintiles haven&#8217;t changed much over the decades,  entry to the third quintile has crept up a bit; and into higher  categories it&#8217;s moved up a lot.  We recognize this as stagnation in the  bottom half and growing inequality in the top half, skewed powerfully to  the top.<br />2) This data set stops in &#8217;09, so Obama is outside the  discussion.  But we can see that all the way up to the 95th percentile,  income growth was dead flat during the Bush administration.  No wonder  the 95% percentile feels so poor.</p>
<p>But &#8212; surely, some  wealth was generated during those 8 years.  GDP growth was positive at  least some of the time.  I wonder where it all went?</p>

                                <p>Nick Turse at <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175594/tomgram%3A_jen_marlowe%2C_the_%22secret%22_revolution_that_could_set_the_middle_east_aflame/?utm_source=TomDispatch&#038;utm_campaign=b0620ac92a-T">Tom Dispatch</a> reminds us amid the election flurry&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was unequivocal in her condemnation. “We have confronted the Russians about stopping their continued arms shipments to Syria,” she said in <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/06/192200.htm">remarks</a> earlier this year. “They have, from time to time, said that we shouldn’t worry; everything they’re shipping is unrelated to their actions internally. That’s patently untrue.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>&#8230;year earlier, the ruling Sunni minority of the tiny Persian Gulf kingdom had unleashed its security forces on pro-democracy protesters, leaving many wounded or dead, while others were arrested and tortured. The <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">U.S. government</a>, which bases the Navy’s Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, stayed largely silent about the abuses and then, a few months later, the Department of Defense notified Congress that it had brokered a new arms deal with the country. The Pentagon had arranged for the sale of $53 million worth of weapons and equipment &#8212; 44 armored Humvees and hundreds of TOW missiles &#8212; to Bahrain’s oil-rich monarchy.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Despite some Congressional opposition, the Obama administration used a legal loophole to move forward with the sale, without any formal public notification, according to a January report by <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">Foreign Policy</a>. (The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the branch of the Pentagon<strong> </strong>that coordinates sales and transfers of military equipment to allies, did not respond to TomDispatch’s request for information on the current status of the arms deal.)</p>
<p>Even if had there been public notice of the sale in the U.S., the response would, at best, have been muted. While American media outlets followed the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt closely, covered Libya’s revolution with zeal, and have remained focused on the brutal civil war in Syria, the story of Bahrain’s popular, largely nonviolent uprising has largely been limited to scattered coverage and wire service roundups. Thankfully, TomDispatch’s <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">Jen Marlowe</a> traveled to Bahrain this summer to witness the continuing uprising and the brutal government response firsthand, before being detained and then <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">thrown out</a> of the country. She offers a ground-level view of the “secret” revolution that few Americans have been able to follow and the reasons why they need to.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, armored vehicles <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">patrolled</a> the streets after Bahrain’s security forces battled protesters on the first anniversary of the 2011 uprising. Next year, thanks to the Obama administration, they may have brand new American Humvees on hand for the crackdown.      <em>Nick Turse</em></p></blockquote>

<p> Romney&#8217;s Tax Views Lead to Blooper Comments Denigrating America&#8217;s Elderly and Poor</p>
<p> Most of us who follow tax issues in the news and in political campaigns are aware that GOP candidate <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/08/romneys-tax-returns-what-we-do-know.html">Mitt Romney</a> has been very secretive about various items.</p>
<p>First and foremost, he has been secretive about his own extraordinary wealth:  he has refused to follow his father&#8217;s example in releasing more than a decade of tax returns and he has maintained numerous accounts offshore, including in jurisdictions that are known for banking secrecy.  This secrecy is problematic for many voters, because without those returns it is difficult to evaluate his aggressiveness in using shelters or taking controversial positions on returns to save himself tax dollars &#8211;a topic that is surely relevant to his qualification to hold the highest executive office in the land.</p>
<p>Second, he has been secretive about his plans for achieving across-the-board tax cuts of enormous benefit to the uber-rich and multinational corporations while claiming to maintain revenue neutrality.  Respected non-partisan tax analysts have concluded that his plans simply don&#8217;t add up&#8211;the &#8220;arithmetic&#8221;, as Democratic speeches noted, is against him.  When he refuses to specify just what programs he would cut while cutting taxes and increasing military expenditures, many voters are naturally suspicious that the cuts will all be taken out of the safety net&#8211;voucherization of Medicare, privatization of education funding, and even more of the deregulation that cost us so much in the 2007-8 financial crisis&#8211;while continuing the over-spending on military and various lucrative loopholes for the wealthy like the &#8220;carried interest&#8221; provision for private equity managers.</p>
<p>Third, he has been secretive about his lack of commitment to the disadvantaged in our society.  His failure to describe how he will create jobs (other than through his claim that managing vulture capital &#8220;leveraged buy-out&#8221; funds is good preparation for the presidency) suggests that he has no ideas other than the long disproven ones being pushed by the Chamber of Commerce and other business lobbying organizations&#8211;less regulation, more privatization, more reductions to earned benefits like Medicare and Social Security, and more tax provisions that favor the rich that the GOP labels&#8211;without empirical support&#8211; as the &#8220;job creators&#8221;.  But he has nonetheless tried to foster an image of caring about American people who weren&#8217;t born to the life of wealth and luxury that he&#8217;s enjoyed.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>That third point of secrecy was shattered by the revelation of a taped video of Romney comments to major donors (delivered at a May 17 fundraiser at an investment banker&#8217;s home in Boca Raton, Florida), in which Romney showed utter disdain for the large segment of the US population who ultimately do not pay any federal income taxes.  Romney called those who pay no federal income tax &#8220;dependent on government&#8221; and indicated that they see themselves as &#8220;victims&#8221;.  He concluded he&#8217;d &#8220;never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p> See David Corn, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser">Secret Video: Romney Tells Millionaire Donors What He REALLY Thinks of Obama Voters</a>, Mother Jones (Sept. 17, 2012).<br />See also Chris Miles, <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/14916/obama-vs-romney-polls-how-latest-romney-gaffe-may-have-just-lost-him-ohio">Obama vs Romney Polls: How Latest Romney Gaffe May Have Just Lost Him Ohio</a>, Policymic (Sept. 17, 2012);  MicCheck.com email alert, 47% Video Worsens Romney&#8217;s September Nightmare (Sept. 18, 2012); Chris Cillizza, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/09/17/mitt-romneys-darkest-hour/">The Fix: Mitt Romney&#8217;s darkest hour</a>, Washington Post.com (Sept. 17, 2012).</p>
<p>Romney&#8217;s 47% comment fairly drips with disdain and scorn for ordinary Americans, casting them, as the Mother Jones article cited above notes, as &#8220;a mass of shiftless moochers who don&#8217;t contribute much, if anything, to society.&#8221; David Corn, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser">Secret Video: Romney Tells Millionaire Donors What He REALLY Thinks of Obama Voters</a>, Mother Jones (Sept. 17, 2012).</p>
<p>It is of a par with comments by a woman that I met at a reception in Boston over the weekend, who spewed scorn as she claimed that anybody that is on welfare or getting unemployment is just a lazy bum that wants the rest of us to hand them a living on a silver platter.  Romney&#8217;s and the woman&#8217;s comments both show absolute insularity from the real world of povery and near-poverty in America in the aftermath of Bush&#8217;s Great Recession, when able-bodied men despair of their situation in being unable to find a job, any job, and young folks grow hopeless as they fill in application after application.  Without government programs to fill in the gaps for these groups, their lives would be truly desperate.  Their non-taxpayer situation has nothing to do with lack of personal responsibility and everything to do with a society in which the economy for too long has favored the uberrich at the cost of ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>Remember that the federal income tax is specifically designed to protect taxpayers in the lower income distributions from paying federal income tax through the use of the standard deduction and personal exemptions.   That&#8217;s because Congress has always assumed that there should be a minimum below which the federal income tax does not reach.  And Congress has enacted a number of other exclusions and credits designed to ensure that the federal income tax doesn&#8217;t fall too heavily on the more vulnerable amongst us.  <br />
<blockquote>About half of those [46% of households] did&#8217;t pay [federal income taxes] because of standard deductions and personal exemptions designed to exclude subsistence levels of income from taxation.  The rest received tax breaks, including the earned income tax credit, the child tax credit and tax benefits for older Americans such as the exclusion of Social Security benefits from income.&#8221;  Richard Rubin,<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-18/romney-s-47-percent-with-no-taxes-include-elderly-poor-workers">Romney&#8217;s 47% With Not Taxes Combines Elderly with Poor Workers</a>, Bloomberg Businessweek (Sept. 18, 2012). </p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, most taxpayers who pay no federal income tax do pay other taxes:  state and local income, property and sales taxes eat up a substantial amount of income, as do federal payroll taxes, which often amount to the most significant tax bite for these lower-income taxpayers.  And as the Rubin article also notes, people who don&#8217;t pay income tax one year&#8211;because of returning for education, job losses, extraordinary medical expenses and other causes&#8211;come back on the tax rolls in later years when they finish studies or find work.</p>
<p>Regrettably, Romney&#8217;s remarks at the fundraiser mainly reveal an eager player in the class warfare game that the right has engaged in for the last few decades&#8211;it reflects a firm support for tax policies that redistribute upwards to the elite, at whatever cost to ordinary Americans who are disdained and even despised as irresponsible and lazy.  With CEOs making 200-400 times what their average workers make and the productivity gains contributed most especially by the workers being siphoned off for increasingly higher pay for the executives, ordinary Americans already are hurting.  Tax policies that continue the rip-off by continuing preferential rates for capital gains, providing even more preferential marginal rates for the uberrich, and eliminating worldwide taxation on multinationals will do even greater harm to ordinary Americans and the sustainability of our economy.</p>

<blockquote>Reader Deontos highlighted <a href="http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/New_York/Insight/2012/09_-_September/Wall_Street_Rules_Applied_to_REMIC_Classification/">a post on Reuters</a> by two Brooklyn Law School professors, Bradley Borden and David Reiss, on a subject near and dear to our hearts, the abject failure of the IRS to take interest in widespread, probably pervasive, violations of REMIC, the part of the Federal tax code that governs mortgage securitizations.
<p>The reason this matters is that this situation belies on of the Administration’s pet claims, that its hands were tied as far as addressing the foreclosure mess was concerned because it had no leverage over servicers. As we’ll discuss, in fact the Administration has a nuclear weapon in its hands that it is simply refusing to use.<br />The reason the Borden and Reiss piece is noteworthy is it’s the first time I’m aware of that experts have chosen to comment at length on the REMIC issue, suggest that there is likely a BIG problem here, and politely point out that the REMICs may have committed fraud, which would allow the statute of limitations to remain open indefinitely, giving the IRS plenty of time to investigate and litigate.</p>
<p>However, I suspect the professors have heard that the IRS is choosing to do nothing, as their quote of Lee Shepard at the top of their piece suggests:</p>
<p>They take aggressive positions, and they figure that if enough of them take an aggressive position, and there’s billions of dollars at stake, then the IRS is kind of estopped from arguing with them because so much would blow up. And that is called the Wall Street Rule. That is literally the nickname for it.</p>
<p>We suspect they know full well the Wall Street Rule is being applied here.</p>

                                <div>Back in October of 2011, I <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/notes-toward-blog-post-on-chrystia.html">blogged</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/joined-ge-capital-board-in-1997.html">a</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/named-one-of-worlds-best-ceos-three.html">bit</a> and Tweeted Chrystia Freeland&#8217;s interview with Jeff Immelt. (Thank you again, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/">Felix</a>.)  What I didn&#8217;t mention, apparently,* is that one of the questions from the floor was a, er, gentleman who declared in No Uncertain Terms precisely <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser">what Willard Romney said at that sexcapade on <s>Lon Gisland</s>Boca</a>.**  The meme has been going around a long time. (And I&#8217;ll wager someone reporting that meeting covered the exchange.)  The problem, as <a href="https://twitter.com/scotthomasson">Scott Thomasson</a> <a href="http://twitpic.com/avrlm4">noted</a> (and got from <a href="http://dmarron.com/2011/07/27/why-do-half-of-americans-pay-no-federal-income-tax/">Don Marron</a> and <a href="http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/2011/07/27/why-do-people-pay-no-federal-income-tax-2/">the Tax Policy Center</a>) is that the large majority of that 47% are from States that vote Republican.  Willard just insulted his natural constituency; as Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/09/romney-stands-by-his-secret-videotape-at-the-sex-party-billionaires-lair-47-of-americans-from-soldiers-to-social-security.html">finally notes</a> (burying the lede better than Albert Brooks in <em>Broadcast News</em>):<br />
<blockquote>Romney does not say: &#8220;I will never convince them to vote for me&#8221;. Romney says: &#8220;I will never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Georgia, Arkansas, South Carolina, Louisiana, and New Mexico:  the Republican candidate has issued you a challenge.  Will you take personal responsibility and care for your lives, or will you continue voting for the Republican Presidential candidate and his minions?*   *New Mexico, I know you guys are trying.</p></div>
