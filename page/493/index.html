<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09310t.pdf">GAO</a> has a report on regulation deficiencies of financial markets:</p>
<blockquote><p>Several key changes in financial markets and products in recent decades have highlighted significant limitations and gaps in the existing regulatory system.</p>
<p>• First, regulators have struggled, and often failed, to mitigate the systemic risks posed by large and interconnected financial conglomerates and to ensure they adequately manage their risks.<br />• Second, regulators have had to address problems in financial markets resulting from the activities of large and sometimes less-regulated market participants—such as nonbank mortgage lenders, hedge funds, and credit rating agencies—some of which play significant roles in today’s financial markets.<br />• Third, the increasing prevalence of new and more complex investment products has challenged regulators and investors, and consumers have faced difficulty understanding new and increasingly complex retail mortgage and credit products.<br />• Fourth, standard setters for accounting and financial regulators have faced growing challenges in ensuring that accounting and audit standards appropriately respond to financial market developments, and in addressing challenges arising from the global convergence of accounting and auditing standards.<br />• Finally, as financial markets have become increasingly global, the current fragmented U.S. regulatory structure has complicated some efforts to coordinate internationally with other regulators.</p></blockquote>

<p>A Country in a Hostile Region<br />(updated version of post)</p>
<p>Say there&#8217;s a country sitting in a hostile area.  A big part of the hostility has to do with religion &#8211; the greater part of the country&#8217;s population has a faith different than that of the neighboring countries, and which is somewhat despised by the neighbors.  But there&#8217;s also something else &#8211; the folks in neighboring countries consider the folks in that country to be newcomers to the region, and usurpers of their land.  In fact, the country owes its existence to an Outside Power that had conquered the region, and later to various international agreements delineating borders.  Part of the country&#8217;s population (and here I speak of those of the despised faith in particular) are descendant of folks that were long indigenous to the region &#8211; in fact, many were at one point refugees from some of the neighboring countries where being a member of that faith meant being treated horribly.  But truth be told, many of them descend from people who emigrated when the Outside Power ruled the area.  Anyhow, the country has been in quite a few wars, some of which were launched by neighboring countries to annihilate the country and its population, and some of these launched by the country itself keeping the intent of its neighbors in mind.  In a number of cases, these wars were even proxy battles between Outside Powers.  Along the way, the country&#8217;s borders changed a number of times.  </p>
<p>Fast forward to a relatively recent date.  There&#8217;s a power struggle going on between two of other groups that lay claim to this country&#8217;s land, and a ceasefire between one of those groups and the country gets violated.  Accusations fly over who did the violating, etc., and a full-scale war breaks out.  </p>
<p>At this point, no doubt, you&#8217;re assuming I&#8217;m discussing Israel and the recent events in Gaza.  I&#8217;m not.  I&#8217;m discussing Bosnia in March 1992.   Now, there are some differences; Bosnia was on the losing end of that particular war, and the world stepped in to help.  There are other differences; I don&#8217;t remember anyone marching on the streets of London or New York insisting that Bosnia should not exist, and that Muslims don&#8217;t belong in the region.  In fact, that would have been considered quite the gauche position to take. </p>
<p>So I was wondering what the difference is in people&#8217;s minds between Israel today and Bosnia in the early 90s.  And the fact that Israel is winning this particular war is not the difference; its still surrounded by neighbors who swear they will one day destroy it, and you can bet that if they ever pull it off, the protesters on the streets of London and New York will rejoice.  And frankly, I don&#8217;t think its the extra time that Bosnia has been existence.  In two hundred or five hundred years, assuming Israel is around, there will still be protesters on the streets of London and New York saying Israel should not exist and that Jews do not belong there; the equivalent of the gauche position when it comes to Bosnia has always been and will apparently always remain quite acceptable when it comes to Israel.</p>
<p>And by the way, just to drive the point&#8230;  it occurs to me that I could change one sentence and the story could be about Singapore, Taiwan, and Jordan, and that&#8217;s just off the top of my head.  (Granted, its a difference sentence in each case, but its still a very, very similar story &#8211; in the case of Singapore and Jordan, even some of the main players are there to play essentially the same roles.)  I have never heard anyone protesting the existence of Singapore and Jordan, and I doubt I ever will. Taiwan, well, China does &#8220;want it back&#8221; but again, nobody is protesting their existence on the streets of London and New York either.</p>
<p>Every possible reason I can think of for this difference in the way Bosnia (or Singapore or Taiwan or Jordan) and Israel are perceived falls apart when I think about it.  Every possible reason but one:  the elephant in the living room.  ____________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p>Give me some help here. With the 2003 Social Security Report the Trustees launched a new measure for evaluating the strength of their projections going forwards. And it can be found here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR03/VI_stochastic.html#wp94108">Appendix E. STOCHASTIC PROJECTIONS</a><br />
<blockquote>1. Background<br />The Trustees Report has traditionally shown additional estimates using a low cost and a high cost set of specified assumptions to reflect the presence of uncertainty. These additional estimates provide a range of possible outcomes for the projections. However, they provide no indication of the probability that actual future experience will be inside or outside the range of these estimates. For the first time, this Trustees Report presents the results of a new model, based on stochastic modeling techniques, that estimates a probability distribution of future outcomes of the financial status of the combined OASI and DI Trust Funds. It should be noted that this model is in its first stage of development. Future improvements and refinements to the model are expected. In particular, future revisions are expected to reflect a fuller range of uncertainty about the future, as is discussed below.</p></blockquote>
<p> Well okay. But then we get this from the 2008 Report <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_stochastic.html#103970">E. STOCHASTIC PROJECTIONS</a><br />
<blockquote>Each of the 5,000 simulations is determined by allowing the above variables to vary throughout the long-range period. The fluctuation in each variable is projected by using standard time-series model ing, a method designed to help make inferences based on historical data. Generally, each variable is modeled by an equation that captures a relation ship between current and prior years’ values of the variable and introduces year-by-year random variation, as reflected in the historical period. For some variables, the equations additionally reflect relationships with other vari ables. Parameters for the equations are estimated using historical data for periods between 20 years and 110 years depending on the nature and quality of data available. Each time-series equation is designed such that, in the absence of random variation, the value of the variable would equal the value assumed under the intermediate set of assumptions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm. Okay again. I am just a peasant here. But can anyone explain in slow terms why exactly this is a test of Intermediate Cost assumptions rather than a somewhat gratutious explanation why simple statisical variation is unlikely to carry us to Low Cost outcomes? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>This chart from the <a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/studies/recession_perspective/index.cfm">Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank</a> is starting to appear on various web sites.  Among others, <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/01/comparing-recessions.html">Alex Tabarrok</a> of Marginal Revolution published it.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SWzwpSW4nNI/AAAAAAAAAm4/2eYbXzH5i8A/s1600-h/Clipboard01+minn.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SWzwpSW4nNI/AAAAAAAAAm4/2eYbXzH5i8A/s320/Clipboard01+minn.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>It is an interesting looking chart, very similar to many I do.</p>
<p>But it struck me as odd, there was something wrong with it.</p>
<p>I can not remember  a single recession where employment did not fall as this chart shows.</p>
<p>So I tried to reproduce the chart and came up with something that looks like this.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SWzw0iLn2dI/AAAAAAAAAnA/R_OBd5Bsi18/s1600-h/Clipboard04.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SWzw0iLn2dI/AAAAAAAAAnA/R_OBd5Bsi18/s320/Clipboard04.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Source: www.bls.gov via Haver Analytics.</p>
<p>Note that it shows the 2001 recession as the mildest recession and it did experience falling employment.  This line as well my line for the harshest recession in 1957 are very different than the chart published by the Minneapolis Federal Reserve and referenced by several libertarian/conservative blogs. Their harshest is about a full percentage point deeper than mine.</p>
<p>But the Minneapolis Fed did publish their original work and I was able to determine that there chart was not of an actual recession.  Rather their lines representing the mildest and harshest recessions are completely artificial creations that have little or no relation to any actual historic event.</p>
<p>Rather than show the 2001 recession as the mildest recession, they went through all of the first months of  the 10 post WW II recession and found the smallest observation and made that the first observation of their mildest recession line.   Next they went through the second month of the ten recession and found the smallest  observation in the second month of recessions and made that the second month of their mildest recession.  They repeated this process for 18 times, each time making the smallest observation of that particular recession month for their line of the mildest recession.  So their line might take observation one from 1957, observation two from 1981, observation three from 1973, etc., etc.  Their so called harshest recession line was created using the same methodology.</p>
<p>Here is exactly how they described the lines in their publication:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>This page places the current economic downturn into historical (post-WWII) perspective. It compares output and employment changes during the present recession with the same data for the 10 previous recessions that have occurred since 1946.</p>
<p>This page provides a current assessment of “how bad&#8221; the recession is relative to past recessions. It will be updated as new data are released. This page does not provide forecasts, and the information should not be interpreted as such.</p>
<p>The following charts provide information about both the length and depth of recessions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/studies/recession_perspective/index.cfm">Minneapolis Fed</a>
<p>This strikes me as a major case of intellectual dishonesty. At no point is the reader shown that their mildest and harshest recessions are completely artificial creations that have no relation to any actual recession.</p>
<p>The other point that strikes me is how libertarian/conservatives like Alex Tabarrok uncritically accept such biased research from fellow right wing sources without any question.  It strikes me that a tenured, PhD,  economist should know that there was no post WW II US recession where employment did not fall and should have recognized that there was something wrong with this chart.  But more than likely, this chart will now be passed around and used by libertarian/conservatives to demonstrate that there was a post WWII recession where employment did not fall and that will become one of their standard talking points.</p>
<p>Am I being too harsh on the Minneapolis Fed and people who uncritically accept and pass on such biased research?</p>
<p>P.S. This is not the first time I have caught the Minneapolis Fed or Alex Tabarrok misrepresenting data.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb (first three sentences edited since original post a few minutes ago)<br />The 2005 Report was a mild disappointment. The 2006 Report somewhat worse.  2007 showed some mild improvement but didn&#8217;t even get us back to 2005 numbers. Now the 2008 on the surface looked a lot brighter but most of that turned out to be the result of a one time change in assumptions about the relations between immigrant earnings and actual payouts (contrary to myth immigrants get a crappy deal from SS). And now the preliminary numbers for 2008 that will go into the 2009 Report are pretty sad and you have to be really, really on the Pollyanna side of life to believe that 2009 employment and wage numbers are going to be so robust as to make up all the difference by the 2010 Report. Really we don&#8217;t seem to have made much progress since the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR05/II_conclu.html#wp86802">2005 Report&#8217;s Conclusion</a> which projected Trust Fund depletion in 2041, a payout of 76% after that, and an actuarial deficit of 1.92%. </p>
<p>All of which might induce some to think that we need to rethink &#8216;Nothing&#8217; as a plan for Social Security. Well not so fast, instead we need to first need replicate the calculation I first suggested back in 2006 in my post <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/05/cost-of-inactivity-nothing-as-plan-for.html">The Cost of Inactivity: &#8216;Nothing&#8217; as a Plan for Social Security</a>.</p>
<p>Plenty of numbers below the fold. Be sure to bring a calculator</p>
<p>I am not here to make the case against PRAs because really I don&#8217;t need to. There is a case to be made that if you had to transition to a system of Private Accounts the time to do it is when the markets are at a low. The problem is convincing anyone that we in fact are at a low or that the markets will ever recover in a way that offsets losses to date in any reasonable time frame. So I&#8217;ll leave that one for Andrew Biggs.</p>
<p>In 2005 we were 36 years from Trust Fund Depletion then set for 2041. Today we are 32 years from TF Depletion still set for 2041. If we don&#8217;t see progress then at some point we will need to make some decision. On the other hand we don&#8217;t need to rashly throw today&#8217;s dollars at a problem that may not happen at all, or happen in a smaller than currently projected form. On what should we base this decision? Well on something I like to call &#8216;arithmetic&#8217;.</p>
<p>The discussion starts with some simplifying assumptions. One is that we can act based only on our knowledge of the past year and our prediction for the next one or two years.( Which is fair enough, anyone who can predict with precision what numbers will look like in 2011 is practicing witchcraft). Two that we are going to treat wages in constant dollar terms and moreover three, assume flat real wages for our four test cases. And four that increases in payroll tax ultimately bear on wages even though in cash flow terms half comes from the employer.  Anyone who wants to present some more sophisticated calcs can do so in comments.</p>
<p>Okay take four individuals aged 25, 35, 45, and 55. The latter will reach full retirement age at 66, the others at 67, meaning that remaining work life is 42, 32, 22, and 11 years respectively. We will assume that each makes $50,000 a year and in constant dollar terms will continue at that wage rate. The payroll gap, meaning the amount FICA would have had to be increased immediately to restore 75 year actuarial balance, in the 2008 Report was 1.7%. That is other things being equal an increase in that amount starting a year ago would have &#8216;fixed&#8217; Social Security. Instead we did &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. Now avoiding a tax increase should have about the same effect as having an equivalent tax cut. So doing nothing left $850 dollars in all four pockets. Under our four assumptions how much would the payroll gap have to increase by the next Report to make  &#8216;Nothing&#8217; a bad bet? Well it varies by age of the subject.</p>
<p>Our 55 year old has 11 years until retirement. As long as the increased annual tax of a higher payroll gap is less than 850/11 he is better off with &#8216;Nothing&#8217; for 2008. Or $77. Which translates to .15% of payroll. So if the new number comes in anywhere higher than 1.85% he is on paper a loser. Can the number move .15%? Well yes but typically the movements come in at about a fifth of that.</p>
<p>Our 45 year old has 22 years until retirement. 850/22=$38.50. Or .075% of payroll meaning that his losing number is 1.78%</p>
<p>Our 35 year old has 32 years until retirement. 850/32=$26.50. Or .053% of payroll meaning that his losing number is 1.75%</p>
<p>Our 25 year old has 42 years until retirement. 850/42=$20.23. Or .047% of payroll meaning that his losing number is 1.74%</p>
<p>So would some of our players have turned out to be nominal losers by not paying $850 last year. Well maybe, even probably. But that serves to discount the current utility of that $850 over the last year or conversely the amount he could earn in interest over the 22 or 32 or 42 years of work life.</p>
<p>Now that is the result if you take the narrowest view. What if you get a little more historical? The gap in 2005 was projected to be 1.92% which assuming a constant dollar $50,000 wage means $960 dollars not taxed or a total of $4800 left in our players pockets since the heights of the There is No Crisis battle of 2005. How much would the gap have to go up in a single year to have made &#8216;Nothing&#8217; a bad cumulative bet? 9.6% in a single year loses everybody money. But anything less than an increase of .79% makes our 55 year old a winner over the rest of his career and even our 25 year old (who probably started working in 2005) is okay as long as the increase does not go up more than .22% or a total of 1.92%. Which is to say that doing &#8216;Nothing&#8217; since 2005 was a worst an even bet for even the youngest worker even if we simply get back to 2005 levels of payroll gap. And the numbers get kind of staggering if you back a little further out and look at 1997 and that 2.23% gap. Now you are looking at $13,800 in foregone taxes. It would take a huge jump in the payroll gap over the medium term to offset that.</p>
<p>As you start adding in real world variables the case only gets stronger. For example that 1.7% number in the 2008 Report assumed a specific performance for 2008: productivity 1.9%, real wage 1.3%, real GDP 2.3%, average unemployment 4.8%. The very failures that serve to make the payroll gap bigger for the next Report equally prove that a 1.7% increase a year ago would not have been enough to fix the problem anyhow. And this doesn&#8217;t even touch the effects of such a tax increase in what we now know was already an economy in recession.</p>
<p>Will there come a time when we are kicking our collective selves because we clung too long to &#8216;Nothing&#8217;? Well almost certainly not for me, I am just 15 years from full retirement. If you are 25 your mileage will vary. But in my view the case is still very strong for &#8216;Nothing&#8217; until or unless the Trust Funds fall out of Short Term Actuarial Balance (TF ratio less than 100 in any of the next 10 years), which is the legal test for solvency. Which under current projections is about 2028.</p>
<p>But for those who insist that &#8216;We can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8217; there are two responses, one polite, one maybe not so. Polite: &#8216;bet me&#8217;, (the less polite one alliterates). And then make them show their work on the back of their paper.</p>

<p>A Further Critique of Romer and Romer</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take another look at the main Romer and Romer findings, namely that under some circumstances, tax cuts are good for economic growth. In the past I noted I have a few problems with it, but I thought I&#8217;d let the Romers work speak for itself as much as possible when making this critique.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the <a href="http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~cromer/draft1108.pdf">most recent version of the best-known paper in this series</a>.   The best explanation in the paper itself for what its about comes from the conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>This paper investigates the causes and consequences of changes in the level of taxation in the postwar United States. We find that despite the complexity of the legislative process, most significant tax changes have a dominant motivation that fits fairly clearly into one of four categories: counteracting other influences on the economy, paying for increases in government spending (or lowering taxes in response to reductions in spending), addressing an inherited budget deficit, and promoting long-run growth. The last two motivations are essentially unrelated to other factors influencing output, and so policy actions taken because of them can be used to estimate the effects of tax changes on output.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that tax changes have very large effects on output. Our baseline specification implies that an exogenous tax increase of 1% of GDP lowers real GDP by almost 3%. Our many robustness checks for the most part point to a slightly smaller decline, but one that is still typically over 2.5%. We also find that the output effects of tax changes are much more closely tied to the actual changes in taxes than to news about future changes, and that investment falls sharply in response to exogenous tax increases.</p>
<p>We also examine the behavior of output following changes in other measures of taxes. The estimated output effects obtained using broader measures of tax changes, such as the change in cyclically adjusted revenues or all legislated tax changes, are substantially smaller than those obtained using our measure of exogenous tax changes. Thus, failing to account for the reasons for tax changes can lead to substantially biased estimates of the macroeconomic effects of fiscal actions. </p></blockquote>
<p>Paragraph 1 tells you they separate out tax changes intended to pay for inherited budget deficits or to promote long term growth (exogenous tax changes, or changes that are not driven by events) from tax changes intended to deal with business cycles and/or increased government spending (endogenous tax changes, or changes that are driven by events). Because the latter group is tied into other ups and downs in the economy, if you want to figure out the &#8220;true&#8221; effect of tax cuts and tax hikes, you should focus on exogenous tax hikes. Paragraph 2 tells you that their exogenous tax changes do ineed show that tax increases will hurt the economy.  Paragraph 3 admits that you only get the paragraph 2 results if you do separate out exogenous and endogenous tax changes.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve stated many, many times before in this blog, one should always check the data.  Always. Check. The. Data.</p>
<p>More after the fold.  Written by cactus</p>
<p>So where does their data come from?  Well, it comes from a narrative they compiled, the most recent version of which is <a href="http://www.econ.berkeley.edu/~cromer/nadraft1108.pdf">here</a>.  The abstract of the narrative record tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>This paper investigates the impact of tax changes on economic activity. We use the narrative record, such as presidential speeches and Congressional reports, to identify the size, timing, and principal motivation for all major postwar tax policy actions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Long story short – they identified all tax changes <bold>they considered major</bold>, including their timing, size and motivation.  While this isn&#8217;t the focus of my criticism, I have two problems with this sentence.  One is that huge changes in regulation and enforcement can come about through what are apparently minor changes in the law.  The transfer pricing regulations, for instance, as I vaguely recall from my days at a (then) Big 6 Accounting firm, come from 2 sentences of law.  Then there&#8217;s the issue of the &#8220;size&#8221; issue on which they expand: </p>
<blockquote><p>Thus, in almost every case we construct our main measure of size using information from our narrative sources concerning policymakers&#8217; estimates of the expected revenue effects.</p>
<p>The most straightforward estimates to use are statements about the expected revenue effects of a tax change at the time it was scheduled to go into effect. Such estimates are often provided in the Economic Reports, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. For this reason, we place particular emphasis on revenue figures from this source. When such statements are not available, we construct our revenue estimates from other contemporaneous descriptions of the expected effects of the tax change on the path of revenues. For example, many tax changes go into effect on January 1 of some year. In these cases, we often use the estimated impact of the change in its first calendar year. When neither straightforward statements of the expected revenue effects nor estimates of the effects in the first calendar year are available, we generally use estimates for the first full fiscal year the law was scheduled to be in effect. The Conference report on the final version of a tax bill is often a particularly rich source of such calendar-year and fiscal-year revenue estimates. </p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, long story short, if St. Ronnie and the Chicago Boys said something was gonna be a tax cut of size X, by golly, that piece of legislation was a tax hike of size X, nevermind what actually happened. </p>
<p>But like I said, I digress.  I have bigger fish to fry than that.  While the skillet is warming up, let&#8217;s look at two tax actions that I know a bit about, and which (according to the Romers) were about the same size:  the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and Balanced Budget Act of 1997.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin with the former, which was classified as &#8220;Exogenous; Deficit-driven&#8221; and which the Romers assign a Present Value of $24.85 billion in 1982Q3.  We&#8217;re told by the Romers:</p>
<blockquote><p>The motivation for this tax increase was deficit reduction and increased fairness. The fiscal action was clearly not taken because policymakers felt the economy was overheating.</p></blockquote>
<p>They add some quotes from St. Ronnie, including this one:</p>
<blockquote><p> Not only must those deficits be reduced, they must show a decline over the next 3 years</p></blockquote>
<p>They also include this one:</p>
<blockquote><p> The most essential thing is to send a message to the money market that we, Democrats and Republicans alike, can agree on reducing the deficit and continuing to hold down inflation</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a third one:</p>
<blockquote><p>I support it [TEFRA] because it will, when combined with our cuts in government spending, reduce interest rates and put more Americans back to work again</p></blockquote>
<p>The Romers then add write this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because the tax increase was taken to reduce the deficit and improve fairness, not to achieve a return to normal economic growth, we classify it as exogenous. Since concern over the deficit appears to have been the primary motivation, we classify it as a deficit-driven tax change. </p></blockquote>
<p>On to the second tax action, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and Balanced Budget Act of 1997.   This one had a couple of components – a small exogenous piece with a $1.93 present value in 1997Q3, tacked onto a negative 20.3 billion &#8220;Endogenous; Spending-driven&#8221; tax (1997Q3 Present Value) tax cut. </p>
<p>They&#8217;re a bit stingier with the Clinton quotes than with the Reagan quotes, but they do give us Clinton&#8217;s explanation for the tax cut:</p>
<blockquote><p>We must balance the budget to keep interest rates down and investment up and jobs coming in.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reads an awful like the Reagan quotes, doesn&#8217;t it?  Especially the third Reagan quote, right?  I mean, there&#8217;s the balancing the budget bit, the keeping interest rates down bit, and the jobs bit.  The two quotes the Romers give us could easily have come from the same speech. </p>
<p>What do the Romers tell us about this tax event?  This:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even though the Congressional motivations were partly philosophical, the tax reduction occurred in the context of a balanced budget agreement between the president and Congressional leaders that called for spending reductions. Thus the tax cut was inextricably linked with spending cuts. We therefore classify it as an endogenous, spending-driven action. </p></blockquote>
<p>OK.  Let&#8217;s review.  These tax changes are associated with two Presidents, both of whom claimed to be concerned about deficits.  We know this because one had already cut the deficit all four years he had already been in office, and the other had been talking about the size of the debt (remember how far he told us a stack of dollar bills would go and back?) for  at least a decade.  Both Presidents reluctantly accept changes to the tax code that doesn&#8217;t quite fit their philosophy – Reagan swallowed a tax hike (he would accept quite a few more, all of which were dwarfed by the big cut in 81 that created the problem) and Clinton took a tax cut – in exchange for less spending from Congress.  Both were very clear about their motivation – it&#8217;s balancing the budget. </p>
<p>And yet, one of these is classified as endogenous by the Romers, and the other is classified as exogenous.  (Frankly, I could almost understand if the Reagan hike was considered endogenous and the Clinton hike exogenous.  The budget deficit to which Reagan was reacting occurred had dropped during the Carter years from 4.2% to 2.7% of GDP, and had gone back to 4% in 82 and would hit 6% in 83, so to some extent, the urgency of action was a reaction to events overtaking his mighty tax cut of 81.  On the other hand, the Clinton tax cut occurred because the Congress truly believed it would increase long run growth.  The Romer&#8217;s classification of these two evnts is not just inconsistent, it makes no sense.) I might add that reading the paper, I had a few issues with the classification of other points as well, but I think these two points illustrate why I think the results of the paper cannot be taken seriously.  So…  the Romers develop a data set based on observations they deem important, they further prune the data set in a manner that is at times inconsistent and seemingly arbitrary, and from there, they manage to show that tax cuts are good for the economy.  Forgive me if I don&#8217;t believe it.  After all, if true, their results, should be easy to show.

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still thinking about <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/optimal-fiscal-policy-in-a-liquidity-trap-ultra-wonkish/">Krugman&#8217;s excellent little model</a> which gives the very clear result that optimal macro policy implies that unemployment is always at the natural rate and so, if the nominal interest rate is zero, the optimal fiscal stimulus should drive unemployment all of the way to the natural rate.</p>
<p>Krugman&#8217;s model is a simple inter-temporal model with rational expectations.  This means that it has the odd feature that tax cuts have no effect on demand &#8212; people rationally understand that they will have to pay for Government consumption (G) sooner or later so they don&#8217;t count the federal debt as part of their net wealth.</p>
<p>Government consumption can still stimulate the economy.  The multiplier is exactly 1 whether it is tax financed or deficit financed (this also requires that money demand depends on private consumption, that is that the Treasury doesn&#8217;t have to keep a significant amount of money in its checking account).</p>
<p>The model is exactly what a model should be &#8212; it is comprehensible (to me only on a second reading the explanation is very brief) and clarifies thought.  Also, of course, it is much simpler than reality.</p>
<p>Krugman is puzzled as to why the Obama administration in waiting proposed a much more modest stimulus.  They make two arguments.  </p>
<p>First that the President isn&#8217;t the fiscal authority &#8212; he proposes but Congress decides.  Obama clearly said that he expects congress to increase spending beyond the proposal, since that is what congress usually does.</p>
<p>Second that a larger stimulus would burden the economy with excessive debt.</p>
<p>Do these arguments make any sense ?  What happens when we combine them ?  I present a &#8220;model&#8221; after the jump which suggests that the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Before deciding whether or not to take the jump, ask yourself 2 questions.</p>
<p>Krugman&#8217;s argument does not depend on the duration of the period of trapped liquidity.  If unemployment were above the natural rate for 10 years with the nominal interest rate equal to zero, then he would recommend fiscal stimulus for 10 years.  Might that lead to an unsustainable deficit and default in the future ? Would that be optimal ?</p>
<p>OK I will present 2 pseudo models.  One is a parody of Krugman&#8217;s model which takes it a few decades back in time.  It is the dear old IS-LM Phillips curve model.  Here fiscal policy affects aggregate demand directly via G or indirectly via disposable income Yd = GNP minus Taxes plus Transfers = Y-T.    In this case, a fiscal stimulus can be turned off and on as quickly as G and T can be changed.  The model is static except for the Phillips curve so the Federal debt doesn&#8217;t matter (it doesn&#8217;t appear at all in the IS-LM model).  Now this model has been out of fashion since before I took my first course in economics.  However, it still affects the way people think, because it is neat and simple and you can come up with an optimizing model which is more or less the same when you have to present your reasoning.  In this case, I think, the &#8220;more or less&#8221; matters a lot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to stick to an IS-LM model except that I will change the assumptions about consumption.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that Krugman can translate my argument to an argument in his model in a minute.  This means I won&#8217;t do the New-Keynesian formal analysis and I will consider investment (isn&#8217;t there in Krugman&#8217;s model).  Being ad hoc, I will just assume investment is a shift variable times decreasing function of the real interest rate.  The crisis is a sharp decline in that shift variable.  I will assume a closed economy, but I really think that doesn&#8217;t matter much.</p>
<p>The model of consumption is rational optimization with overlapping generations of infinite lived agents (due to  O.J. Blanchard).  Huh ?  Let me explain.  A standard macro optimizing model of consumption assumes that all consumers are rational, immortal and identical.  It implies that the timing of taxes has no effect on anything (shows Ricardian equivalence).  This feature is not realistic.  Krugman assumes Ricardian equivalence.  </p>
<p>A way to avoid this result is to have new agents arrive who will help repay the debt even though they didn&#8217;t benefit from the tax cuts or G increase which caused it.  Say half of the debt (in present value) will be paid by people who haven&#8217;t arrived yet arrivals.  This means that government bonds are net wealth for current inhabitants, not at their full market value but, on average, at half of it (the value of the bonds I own minus my share of the extra taxes to pay for them).  Barro might argue that, with bequests, taxes paid by the children of the current residents count as taxes paid by current residents.  Now I think he is fundmantally wrong, because I don&#8217;t think people are approximately rational.  However, here and now I am assuming full rationality, so I appeal to immigrants.  US residents clearly don&#8217;t care much about foreigners and about a million of them are (legally) entering the US a year and paying taxes.  </p>
<p>OK now I assume logarithmic utility, this makes things simple,  it means that optimal consumption is the rate of time preference (rho) times total wealth which consists of physical wealth plus the present discounted value of future labor income minus the present value of future tax payments.  Future labor income depends on the future capital stock and on future unemployment rates, but I will mostly assume it is exogenous.</p>
<p>This means that consumption depends on the federal debt.  It is what it would be with no federal debt + 0.5rho times the federal debt.  There is an effect of fiscal policy on consumption, but it depends on the debt and not on current taxes as in the original IS-LM model.</p>
<p>Now Obama (and Krugman) clearly believe that, for a given path of G, a huge national debt is a bad thing in normal times, that is when unemployment is set equal to the natural rate by the FED.  This means that output is the same no matter what the federal debt is.  Consumption is greater if there is more debt, so investment is lower.  They guess that the market is about right without distortion so the optimal debt is roughly zero.  Higher debt distorts consumption savings decisions and crowds out investment.  Krugman just decided that this is a separate issue.  He was talking about optimal G not optimal debt.  Now in his model as written, it doesn&#8217;t matter when the government taxes because the model has Ricardian equivalence.  Krugman doesn&#8217;t believe in Ricardian equivalence.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that the policy which he really thinks is the one true optimal policy is a balanced budget expansion of G whcih will stimulate the economy and won&#8217;t build up increased federal debt.  Obviously this is politically impossible and so Krugman doesn&#8217;t mention taxes in his little model.</p>
<p>Now to get his result he doesn&#8217;t strictly need that the increased G is financed at the time it is spent.  With Ricardian non-equivalence, he could even get a larger effect of G by running up a deficit.  However, as soon as the interest rate gets to be positive, he wants the debt to be as low as possible.   In my &#8220;model&#8221; as unwritten, this would require the extra G of fiscal stimulus to be financed with taxes collected during the period of trapped liquidity.  That&#8217;s not going to happen either.</p>
<p>Another model says that there are political limits on the budget (imposed by congress) and especially on taxes, so there is a minimum feasible deficit.  This would mean that, once we are out of the crisis, Krugman would set the deficit to this minimum value (which might be a surplus).  this means that all debt built up while the economy is in the liquidity trap will distort the mix between consumption and investment for a long long time, that is, until Krugman would have gotten the debt to the level he likes, which, I would guess, is zero.</p>
<p>The argument for accepting unemployment over 4.8% makes sense.  In the &#8220;model&#8221; and in reality, the federal debt matters.  Obama is not the fiscal authority.  He won&#8217;t be able to pay back the debt built up during the crisis as fast as he would like. Therefore he doesn&#8217;t want to build up too much.</p>
