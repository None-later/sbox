                                <p>In contrast to what <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/oil-prices.html">I suggested yesterday</a>, the head of the Kansas City Fed thinks that current oil prices will have little effect on the US economy.  From <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/09/29/news/economy/fed.reut/index.htm">CNN/Money</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As long as oil prices do not rise significantly higher, the likely effects of recent increases will be relatively modest on the U.S. economy,&#8221; Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Hoenig told a forum of local business leaders Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8230;He said that the country was better protected from an oil shock than in the past and also had the benefit of monetary and fiscal policies that were both aiding growth. Nor were oil prices, once adjusted for inflation, that steep in historical terms.</p></blockquote>
<p>I disagree with that last statement.  Yes, real oil prices were higher in the early 1980s; but is that really the benchmark that you want to use for comparison?  I actually think that real oil prices are quite high right now, relative to past periods of healthy economic growth.  As I pointed out yesterday, the only period in which they were higher was 1979-85.  The chart below illustrates.</p>

<p>One last quibble: how exactly is monetary policy &#8220;aiding growth&#8221; when the Fed is currently <em><strong>increasing</strong></em> interest rates?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>If you want to see a bleakly pessimistic picture painted of the sustainability of the US&#8217;s current account deficit, take a look at <a href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/globalmacro/Roubini-Setser-US-External-Imbalances.pdf">this paper</a> by Nouriel Roubini and Brad Setser.  They argue that, within a very few years, the US&#8217;s net international debt will be too large for the deficits to continue, and that the ensuing adjustment will be painful.  They estimate that:
<ul>
<li>By 2008, the US&#8217;s current account deficit will be more than 7% of GDP (in the absence of major policy changes).<br />
</li>
<li>The adjustment in the US&#8217;s trade deficit required simply to keep the foreign debt/GDP ratio <strong><em>constant</em></strong> is 5% of GDP &#8212; i.e. imports will have fall by 1/3 or exports will have to double (or some combination thereof).<br />
</li>
<li>By 2008, the US&#8217;s net foreign debt will total 50% of GDP (up from about 28% today).</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors will make foreign creditors unwilling to continue loaning the US money at current interest rates, Roubini and Setser argue.  They therefore expect a large rise in interest rates along with a large fall in the value of the dollar to happen sometime in the latter part of this decade, at the latest.  The picture below shows the US&#8217;s foreign assets and liabilities, and illustrates that the current large net foreign debt of about $2.5 trillion is a fairly new phenomenon.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/US_NIPosition.jpg"></p>
<p>But I disagree slightly with Roubini and Setser&#8217;s assessment of why these imbalances will end.  As they note, for any other country, the grim statistics on the US&#8217;s external debt would raise all sorts of warning flags for investors.  But the fundamental difference between the US and any other country is crucial: the US can repay its loans in its own currency, and its own currency will continue (for the forseeable future) to be widely demanded for many types of international transactions, such as the purchase of oil.  Even with a massive external debt, I find it impossible to believe that creditors would start to consider default by the US government a real possibility.</p>
<p>So I think that there&#8217;s one key to understanding if and when the financial adjustment will occur, and it&#8217;s not the debt/GDP ratio: it&#8217;s how Asian central banks feel about lending the US money at the rapid pace that we&#8217;ve seen over the past year.   Every time that the central bank of China or Japan buys dollar-denominated bonds, it necessarily increases its own money supply.  Over the past year, for example, China has accumulated an additional $125 bn in foreign reserves, and its (narrow) money supply has risen from $950 bn to $1,100 bn, according to the IMF.  As long as China and Japan are content to let their money supply expand at this rate, they will have no reason to stop buying US dollars.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I think that the endgame for the US current account deficit will have nothing to do with international investors starting to doubt the credit-worthiness of the US, as would happen with any other country in this situation.  Rather, it depends completely on what happens in the domestic economies and central bank boardrooms of East Asia.</p>

                                <p>A number of people I&#8217;ve talked to lately are fairly pessimistic about Kerry&#8217;s chances, which is probably due to the recent swath of polls showing Bush with either an implausibly large lead (12+ points) or a modest but consistent lead (3-5 points). So I thought I&#8217;d share some of the good news that&#8217;s out there.<br />

<ul>
<li><a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2004_09_26_digbysblog_archive.html#109637759350670942">Digby reminds us</a> that creating an &#8220;aura of invincibility&#8221; is an old tactic that Karl Rove uses because Rove believes that swing voters want to vote for the eventual winner. Witness Bush&#8217;s trip to California just before election 2000, which was in fact a very close election. For more on this point, see <a href="http://www.slate.com/Default.aspx?id=2107259&#038;">this Slate story</a> by Chris Sullentrop (&#8220;The worse things get for Bush, the more likely his aides are to declare that he is invincible. The Bushies are starting to sound like Baghdad Bob, trumpeting a decisive victory for Saddam Hussein as the American military zooms into Iraq&#8217;s capital city.&#8221;)</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.moveon.org/content/pdfs/Final-Gallup-Ad.pdf">This MoveOn ad</a>, along with about 3 out of every 4 posts <a href="http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/index.php">over at Ruy T.&#8217;s blog</a>, points out that there are some glaring problems with the Gallup poll numbers. In particular, Gallup&#8217;s samples are drawing on far more self-declared Republicans than there are in the population &#8212; unless the number of Republicans has increased by about 8 percentage points since the Republican convention. Ruy&#8217;s even made up <a href="http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/archives/000729.php">a fun Gallup game</a> you can play at home.  Ok, it may only be fun if you&#8217;re a politics and numbers junkee.
</li>
<li>That bastion of left-wing bias, The Wall Street Journal, based on 9/20/04 results from Zogby, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/page/0,,2_1064,00.html?mod=2%5F1064">reports that</a> (scroll down to and click on &#8220;Battlegrounds&#8221; &#8212; subscription required)<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Sen. John Kerry&#8217;s state tally shrank but his overall position appears to have stabilized among likely voters in many of the 16 battleground states&#8230;</p>
<p>Mr. Kery now leads in 11 states &#8212; down from 12 states he held two weeks ago and 14 a month ago &#8212; and his leads over President Bush in Florida and Arkansas are less than one percentage point. At the same time, he maintained or added to comfortable advantages in Michigan, Oregon and New Mexico&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; Presuming that all the [battleground] states &#8212; including the 33 electroal votes from the tight Florida and Arkansas races &#8212; go to the current leading candidates and that the other 34 states and the District of Columbia go as they did in the 2000 election, Mr. Kerry would get 297 electoral votes and Mr. Bush would get 241.<br />
</p></blockquote>
</li>
<p>
<li>Finally, constituting perhaps the best news of all, the AP is reporting that <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;u=/ap/20040928/ap_on_el_pr/new_voters&#038;cid=694&#038;ncid=2043">voter registration is surging</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>New voters are flooding local election offices with paperwork, registering in significantly higher numbers than four years ago as attention to the presidential election runs high and an array of activist groups recruit would-be voters who could prove critical come Nov. 2.</p>
<p>Cleveland has seen nearly twice as many new voters register so far as compared with 2000; Philadelphia is having its biggest boom in new voters in 20 years; and counties are bringing in temporary workers and employees from other agencies to help process all the new registration forms.</p>
<p>Nationwide figures aren&#8217;t yet available, but anecdotal evidence shows an upswing in many places, often urban but some rural. Some wonder whether the new voters — some of whom sign up at the insistence of workers paid by get-out-the-vote organizations — will actually make it to the polls on Election Day, but few dispute the registration boom.</p>
<p>&#8230;New registered voters in Miami-Dade County, a crucial Florida county in 2000, grew by 65 percent through mid-September, compared with 2000.</p>
<p>New registered voters jumped nearly 150 percent in Cuyahoga County (Cleveland) in Ohio, one of the most hard-fought states this year.<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>While I suppose it&#8217;s possible that this surge is split between <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040622-122338-9915r.htm">Karl Rove&#8217;s 4 million non-voting evangelicals</a> and more Democratic-leaning new registrants, that seems unlikely. Based on the AP story, the surge is widespread, but more pronounced in urban areas than rural. Moreover, I wonder how many of Rove&#8217;s hypothetical non-voting evangelicals live in battleground states? In short, I&#8217;m siding with the conventional wisdom that higher turnout will favor the Democrat (and assuming that a good portion of these new registrants, half or so, will actually vote.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So do I think Kerry has this election in the bag? Not by a long shot. But Kerry supporters would be better served if they spent a lot less time and energy on wailing and gnashing of teeth, and instead devoted time, energy, and money to supporting John Kerry.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Each Tuesday until the election, I will try to review one of the five chapters in the Bush-Cheney <a href="http://www.georgewbush.com/Agenda">Agenda for America</a>.  Today’s review is directed at Chapter 1’s <em>Creating Opportunity for America’s Workers</em>, which has as its highlights:</p>
<blockquote><p>• Reforming America’s High Schools: President Bush will provide $250 million annually to extend state assessment of student reading and math skills.<br />
<br />• Jobs for the 21st Century Initiative: President Bush will provide $500 million for Jobs for the 21st Century, which will help educate and train high-skilled American workers in schools and community colleges.<br />
<br />• Tax Reform: President Bush will work to make the tax code simpler for taxpayers, encourage saving and investment, and improve the economy’s ability to create jobs and raise wages.<br />
<br />• Opportunity Zones: President Bush will create new Opportunity Zones, which will encourage public and private investment and provide priority consideration for Federal benefits to communities that are under economic hardship.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice the first and second bullet points suggest more government spending.  However, an additional $250 million in education spending is less than 0.5% of what we spend on elementary and high school education.  If this funding for Jobs for the 21st Century is distributed over 5 million workers, which is about the shortfall in job creation for the Bush years, then it amounts to a mere $100 per person.  And of course, the last two sound like the usual free-lunch supply-side or voodoo economics.  </p>
<p>The webcite asks one to read the chapter, but there things only get worse from the very opening: “Three years. Three tax cuts. An economic recovery—American ingenuity—unleashed.”  Over the past four years, real GDP has grown less than 2.3% per year and yet, Bush-Cheney declares this to be an economic recovery unleashed.  The second of their three charts that will put new meaning into misleading graphics notes one forecast (from Macro Economic Advisors) that suggests we will enjoy growth of “nearly 20% over the next five years”.  Wow – a nine-year period where total growth was only 30% or about 3% per year.  At this rate, we might see a return to full employment by 2020.  </p>
<p>Most of this chapter uses hyped-language to boost of all the aid the government will give us but a cynical reader might wonder if this aid will be from a “tin cup” as Senator Kennedy once said.  But when the read gets to “Fostering Economic Prosperity”, maybe one hopes that government spending will not increase by very much as the centerpiece of this section seems to be:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2000, George W. Bush ran for President on a promise of lowering taxes, allowing the American people to keep more of what they earn. President Bush believes that our economy grows when families and businesses have more of their own money to spend and invest… This tax relief must be made permanent so families and businesses can plan for the future with confidence…President Bush will work with Congress to make the tax code simpler for taxpayers, encourage saving and investment, and improve the economy&#8217;s ability to create jobs and raise wages.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, one does not increase the nation’s savings and investment using long-term deficit financing.  But then this chapter makes the brazen claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>The President has put our country on a path toward cutting the budget deficit in half over the next five years. In the critical areas of defense and homeland security, the President is spending wisely … Pesident Bush will build on this budget discipline by supporting budget rules that make Federal spending conform to the kind of constraints and common sense known to every family.</p></blockquote>
<p>The third graph makes three claims that it graphs in a distorting way: (a) that Federal spending will be 20.1% of GDP in 2004, (b) the historical average for Federal spending as a share of GDP is 19.5%; and (c) that Federal spending will fall to only 19.1% of GDP by 2009.  The chapter fails to tell us over what period this historical average was drawn.  But more importantly, the chapter’s only suggestion for cutting back on Federal spending is some alleged reduction in $35 billion per year of waste, which of course is far short of the alleged reduction in spending equal to 1% of GDP.   </p>
<p>Maybe the person who reviewed this document for logical consistency should sign up for some of the remedial education courses promised in this document.    Beyond its logical inconsistency, it is unclear how this “Agenda” would restore full employment, provide for more investment and long-term growth, or reduce the massive Federal deficit, which is rapidly increase the Federal debt to GDP ratio.<br /></p>

                                <p>The price of oil is hovering around $50/barrel today, <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7BD3AB8DB5-0DD9-45AB-A1CA-50F8081A7F45%7D&#038;siteid=mktw">a new record</a> in nominal terms.  The chart below shows the spot price of oil over the past few years.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/oilprice1.jpg"><br />Source: EIA.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s true that oil prices were higher in the early 1980s in real terms.  Yes, the oil shocks of the 1970s were about four times the magnitude of this one in percentage terms.  And yes, it&#8217;s true that the US economy uses considerably less oil per unit of output than it used to.</p>
<p>However, this still worries me.  If sustained, this 50% increase in the price of oil over the last year <em><strong>will</strong></em> have real effects on the US economy.  The US has not had to pay this much for oil (in real terms) in 20 years.  The only other time in US history when oil cost so much was the period 1979-85, a period that saw two recessions, record inflation, and average real GDP growth of just 2.6% per year, well below its trend growth rate of about 3.5%.</p>
<p>The crucial question then becomes this: for how long will oil prices stay so high?  Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve seen no evidence (or even compelling argumentation) that suggests that oil prices are going to fall any time soon. </p>

<p>Clearly it&#8217;s time to redouble my efforts to inject some economist thinking into the public discourse.</p>

<p>Update: I slightly altered the wording of the Q above for clarity.</p>

I&#8217;ve heard them use &#8220;tax relief&#8221; many times over the last week, but I can&#8217;t recall any instances of &#8220;tax cuts&#8221; or &#8220;tax reductions,&#8221; much less &#8220;tax shifts.&#8221;</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Pandagon’s <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/">Don&#8217;t Pay Attention To Your Wallet&#8230;It&#8217;s Being Silly</a> takes on this Bruce Bartlett <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/commentary/20040831-101020-1546r.htm">oped</a> by noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The gist of it is that the middle class is only shrinking because it&#8217;s getting richer. Bartlett presents a variety of statistics, which might be persuasive but for one niggling problem. <em>Real income is going down.</em> Everything Bartlett uses to &#8220;prove&#8221; his point is kind of negated by the very real decrease in incomes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Table A-1 of <em>Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2003</em> from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p60-226.pdf">Census Bureau</a> shows median real income (2003$) from 1967 to 2003. Note the following data:</p>
<p> Year  Income<br />
<br /> 1967  $33,338<br />
<br /> 1979  $38,649<br />
<br /> 1993  $39,165<br />
<br /> 1999  $44,992<br />
<br /> 2003  $43,318</p>
<p>So median real income in 2003 was only 96.3% of its 1999 value, which is Pandagon’s point. So what was Mr. Bartlett trying to say?  Bartlett was complaining about an August 28 piece by Timothy Egan using some very partisan language.  At one point Bartlett writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, it is important to know the data in the Times story are adjusted for inflation. This is mentioned in a footnote to the chart, but nowhere else in the article.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, I used the real income data from Table A-1 of this Census report so let me state this clearly.  But I hope Mr. Bartlett would not have us do otherwise.  But here is what Bartlett’s frustration with Egan’s article seems to be:</p>
<blockquote><p>The clear implication is the middle class has suffered under Republican policies — why else start in 1980, the year Ronald Reagan was elected? If the chart had started in 1992, the year Bill Clinton was elected, it would have shown the exact same trend.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pandagon and Bartlett were talking about two different time spans.  Mr. Egan’s article states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senator John Kerry says the middle class has shrunk since President Bush took office, and when judged by the percentage of Americans who made $25,000 to $75,000 in 2003 &#8211; 45 percent of households &#8211; he is right, according to factcheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center that monitors campaign claims.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Pandagon was noting the same period that Egan noted.  </p>
<p>It is true that real income rose by 16.4% over the 20 year period from 1979 to 1999, but the growth for the first 14 years of the time span was just over 1.3% with real income growing by almost 15% during the last 6 years.  Also note that median real income grew by almost 16% from 1967 to 1979.  </p>
<p>I don’t wish to sound partisan so let me leave Democrat v. Republican out of this and simply note that the two periods where median real income grew rapidly were periods of fiscal responsibility whereas the Reagan-Bush41 and the Bush43 periods were ones where policymakers pretended to give people their money back but never bothered to cut government spending.  Mr. Bartlett preaches the virtues of savings for long-term growth as passionately as I do.  And his critiques of Bush43’s fiscal recklessness and trade protection are quite good coming from someone who writes for NRO.  We know he would prefer a smaller government, but why does he carry the water for Administration’s who only pretend they do and then wreck fiscal responsibility and the savings necessary for long-term growth?<br /></p>

                                <p>I spent about 8 hours in the airport today, reading the Sunday NY Times from cover to cover, and I can report that the best article in it is John Tierney&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/26/magazine/26HIGHWAY.html?pagewanted=all&#038;position=">The Autonomist Manifesto</a>.&#8221; It&#8217;s a wide-ranging article making the case for sprawl and cars. Particularly interesting was his description of &#8220;HOT lanes,&#8221; high-occupancy toll lanes that can be used by carpoolers and busses for free, or lone drivers for pay.<br />
<blockquote>Drivers sitting in a traffic jam outside San Diego used to glance across the median strip of I-15 at a maddening sight: car-pool lanes without any car-poolers. The lanes were so empty that engineers decided to let solo drivers share them for a price, which is displayed on electronic signs at the entrance to the lanes. A computer counts how many cars take the offer and then recalibrates the price every six minutes, raising the toll if too many cars accept, cutting it if not enough do.<br />
<br />&#8230;.<br />
<br />When this experiment began in 1996, some critics said it was unfair to create these &#8221;Lexus lanes.&#8221; But by now, even drivers who won&#8217;t pay the toll have come to appreciate the lanes because they divert traffic from the regular highway. And while affluent drivers are more likely to pay the bill, surveys have found people of all incomes using the lanes. Most of the ones I interviewed were budget-conscious, middle-class commuters who used the free lanes when possible. But when the traffic got heavy, they considered the toll a bargain.</p></blockquote>
<p>San Diego-style congestion pricing could be a big deal if it spread widely; to other cities, and to gridlocked city centers as well as highways. According to Paul Krugman, writing in 1996 before four years of George Bush drove him shrill, <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/economy/TaxReformObsession.html">traffic reform has a potential payoff about as big as tax reform</a>: about $50 billion a year.</p>
<p>When an idea is promoted by the libertarian-leaning John Tierney, the liberal Paul Krugman, and <a href="http://www.cio.com/archive/071503/london.html">&#8220;Red Ken&#8221; Livingstone</a>, the socialist Mayor of London, that&#8217;s an idea whose time has come.<br /></p>

                                <p>My welcome to Chef Ragout extends on his excellent post <a href="http://ragout.blogspot.com/">One Reason Why Houses are So Expensive</a>, which notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. imports about a third of its lumber from Canada and imposes a 27% tariff, arguing that Canada subsidizes its lumber industry by selling trees from government owned land too cheaply. The tariffs were imposed by the Bush administration in 2001, hoping to win some votes from the lumberjacks and sawmill owners, I suppose. Before that, the Clinton administration imposed quotas on Canadian lumber. The US has lost a series of NAFTA and WTO cases, most recently last month, but continues to appeal, dragging out the issue and keeping the tariffs in place.</p></blockquote>
<p>His post links to <a href="http://www.acah.org/history.htm">this history</a> of trade protection on imports of softwood lumber from Canada. It notes that the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports has been a group of U.S. lumber producers primarily funded by Georgia Pacific and International Paper.  Not only has the Bush White House granted protectionist favors to these two companies but some in the Clinton White House had been willing to limit free trade.  </p>
<p>The 10-K filings for Georgia Pacific and International Paper are available <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">here</a>.  Both companies sell forest and paper products.  International Paper has manufacturing operations in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asian, and Latin America.  The company has harvesting rights on 7.9 million acres of government-owned forest lands in Canada and operates wood products plants in the Canada were it produces 1.2 billion board feet of lumber and 450 million square feet of plywood annually. </p>
<p>Georgia Pacific produces 6.5 billion square feet of softwood lumber in 20 plants throughout the southeast of the U.S.  The production represents 32% of North America’s capacity.  Georgia Pacific also produces gypsum in Canada, some of which is sold to U.S. customers.  Georgia Pacific also sells approximately $3 billion of its products each year abroad primarily to Canadian customers.  </p>
<p>Both companies benefit from NAFTA in two ways: selling U.S. made products to Canadian customers and producing some of it products from American customers in Canada.  Yet, these two companies have induced U.S. policy makers to protect their softwood lumber operations from Canadian competition.<br /></p>
