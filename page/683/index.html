                                <p>I love a good conspiracy theory as much as the next guy.</p>
<p>I am going to weave you one&#8211;connecting Spitzer&#8217;s recent confession as Client Number 9 in the Emperor&#8217;s Club and his February announcement that the Bush administration through the OCC (Office of the Controller of the Currency) has been complicit in allowing predatory lending practices among national banks and thrifts.</p>
<p>Spitzer <i>was</i> a rising hero in the Democratic Party, obviously scheduled for callings higher than that as governor of New York State. The long and short of this conspiracy theory is: &#8220;They&#8221; got him. Spitzer, like Bill Clinton, has a big weakness: His desire for illicit sex.</p>
<p>Some caveats before I start.
<ul>
<li>Spitzer was caught fair and square. He just had to have his crotch illicitly jollied</li>
<li>Wall Street hated him. We cannot blame them, nor can we deny it its jubilation at his fall. (It did cheer at the news.)</li>
<li>Spitzer had plenty of enemies in New York state. He has been accused, rightfully or wrongly, of unfair prosecutorial practices.</li>
<li>For many, Spitzer was a hero in bringing the likes of Merrill Lynch to heel. (I cheered; I was once a client of ML. I remember asking my ML advisor about the charges. He hemmed and hawed.)</li>
<li>Those who hate Spitzer will certainly connect his prosecutorial practices with his visits to the Emperor&#8217;s Club.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, while I love conspiracy theories, I do not necessarily believe them. But I thought I would be among the first to trot this one out. Do I believe it? I am not sure.</p>
<p>On February 28, 2008, Spitzer wrote an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/13/AR2008021302783.html">article</a> in the Washington Post, one that received little attention, yet one that strikes at the heart of the subprime mess that is now threatening each and every one of us.</p>
<blockquote><p>Several years ago, state attorneys general and others involved in consumer protection began to notice a marked increase in a range of predatory lending practices by mortgage lenders. Some were misrepresenting the terms of loans, making loans without regard to consumers&#8217; ability to repay, making loans with deceptive &#8220;teaser&#8221; rates that later ballooned astronomically, packing loans with undisclosed charges and fees, or even paying illegal kickbacks. These and other practices, we noticed, were having a devastating effect on home buyers. In addition, the widespread nature of these practices, if left unchecked, threatened our financial markets.</p>
<p>Predatory lending was widely understood to present a looming national crisis. This threat was so clear that as New York attorney general, I joined with colleagues in the other 49 states in attempting to fill the void left by the federal government. Individually, and together, state attorneys general of both parties brought litigation or entered into settlements with many subprime lenders that were engaged in predatory lending practices. Several state legislatures, including New York&#8217;s, enacted laws aimed at curbing such practices</p>
<p>In 2003, during the height of the predatory lending crisis, the OCC invoked a clause from the 1863 National Bank Act to issue formal opinions preempting all state predatory lending laws, thereby rendering them inoperative. The OCC also promulgated new rules that prevented states from enforcing any of their own consumer protection laws against national banks. The federal government&#8217;s actions were so egregious and so unprecedented that all 50 state attorneys general, and all 50 state banking superintendents, actively fought the new rules</p></blockquote>
<p>The OCC is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Charted in 1863, its purpose is to organize and to administer a system of national banks and a uniform currency. Its mission is &#8220;&#8230;to ensure that national banks are safe and sound, competitive and profitable, and capable of serving in the best possible manner the banking needs of its customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his 2003 annual report, J. D. Hawke, Jr., then Comptroller of the Currency, <a href="http://www2.blogger.com/www.occ.gov/annrpt/2003%20Annual%20Report.pdf">said:</a></p>
<p>
<blockquote>The OCC defines predatory lending as the aggressive marketing of credit to borrowers who cannot afford it on the terms being offered—typically, on the basis of the liquidation value of the collateral. The OCC issued two advisory letters to national banks, aimed at ensuring that neither they nor their subsidiaries engage in lending that might be considered predatory, and that their lending complies with safety and soundness standards and all applicable consumer protection laws. A number of states sought to impose their own anti-predatory lending laws on national banks in 2003. In response to an appeal by two national banks and after reviewing public comment, the OCC concluded that a Georgia law that imposed severe restrictions on all lenders operating within the state, did not apply to national banks and their subsidiaries. In issuing this preemption determination, the OCC ruled that the Georgia law interfered with national banks’ ability to exercise permissible federal powers and was thus in conflict with federal law.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that Hawke, Jr. defined predatory practices rather nicely. Yet what has the OCC done? Were they the watch dogs they should have been? What if those at the top were looking only at the profits without regard for the consequences? I have the feeling that the &#8220;buddy system&#8221; is alive and well in Washington. The officers of the OCC wine and dine with the banking and financial crowd.</p>
<p>A storm was brewing. Many state examiners were concerned that predatory lending practices were on the rise. In 2003, the seeds of the now subprime disaster had been planted. Some people were concerned. The OCC was apparently doing nothing. (How well I remember Secretary&#8217;s Paulson&#8217;s comment that we have to be careful not to stifle financial innovation with regulations&#8230;and undue oversight?)</p>
<p>In response to this storm, Julie L. Williams, then Chief Counsel of the OCC, issued the following remarks:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>At the heart of these issues are Constitutional principles of Federal preemption. We are acutely aware that in many quarters the very concept of preemption is unpopular. In some respects, the fact that Federal preemption arises from the federal charter of national banks seems to put us, inescapably, at odds with some state authorities. This is unfortunate, because the OCC and the states do not have fundamentally different goals. </p></blockquote>
<p>At heart was the concept of &#8220;uniform&#8221; administrative system. Because the OCC was charged with organizing and administering a uniform system of banking, the OCC employed &#8220;Federal preemption,&#8221; arguing that any other approach simply led to chaos. In short, the states could not oversee or regulate national banks, regardless their suspicions of predatory or dangerous lending practices. She does have a point. A uniform regulatory system is important. What happened, I suspect, is that the laissez-faire principle was in effect. Money was being made. Friends were happy.</p>
<p>A somewhat similar preemption occurred during the Keating Lincoln Savings and Loan Association <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEEDE123CF933A25754C0A96F948260">scandal</a> of the 1980/s. This preemption involved the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.</p>
<p>San Francisco examiners suspected that Lincoln was engaged in high risk investments. Keating asked that the examiners be removed in favor of Seattle based examiners. At first the FHLB objected the removal of the San Francisco examiners. Then, oddly enough, by a vote of 2 to 1, it removed them, recommending that &#8220;oversight of Lincoln be handed either to the bank board&#8217;s Washington, D.C., office or to examiners from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keating, apparently, had squealed long and loudly about the San Francisco examiners. His voice was heard.</p>
<p>A year later, that scandal finally broke with the bank board taking &#8220;over Lincoln, with $5.5 billion in assets, saying it posed a threat to the banking system. Losses at the institution, which has vast holdings of undeveloped land in Arizona, are expected to exceed $2 billion. &#8220;</p>
<p>The FHLB&#8217;s handling of the Lincoln case was cause for much Congressional scrutiny. Guess who worked for the FHLB during this time. Yup, Julie L. Williams, soon to be Chief Counsel at the OCC.</p>
<p>So there you have it, a brand new conspiracy theory. Spitzer was the visible leader, spearheading the attempt to hold responsible those who have created what Nouriel Roubini calls a &#8220;financial meltdown.&#8221; His voice was a national voice, not some out-of-the way examiner. Was there an attempt to find the messenger&#8217;s weakness, to sully him so that his message would not be heard?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rest assured, the media will deluge us with soiled panties and other sexual sundries. The Roman circus has been ramped up. Nothing in this country sells quite so much as sex and sexual scandals. We just cannot help peering into our neighbors windows to see how they &#8220;do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yup, &#8220;they&#8221; got him, and &#8220;they&#8221; got him in a way that will tease and delight us all.</p>

<blockquote>Andrew Samwick at <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2008/03/what-unemployment-rate-misses.html">VoxBaby</a> posted on unemployment rate &#8220;What the unemployment rate misses? &#8220;. This post obtained a relatively high visibility and was commented on by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/voxbaby-unemployment-figures.html">Angry Bear</a> and <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/03/the-misleading.html">Big Picture</a>. I think that this approach is slightly biased and misleading . What we really need (to consider)is the driving force behind unemployment, not its measured level. Any current measure is far enough from some true one, if the latter does exist. In this blog, we devote enough time to modeling and prediction of unemployment in the USA and other developed countries. This is the reason to comment on the aforementioned posts and revisit our position to strenghten it with some new examples. Figures 2 and 3 do elaborate on the link between unemployment and the change rate of labor force using monthly estimates for both variables.</p>
<p>The figure presented by Vox Baby is a good illustration of the political thinking behind the post. Some people just want the unemployment level to be as large as possible. At first glance, all curves in the figure look similar. In that sense, having one of the definitions of unemployment is enouth to obtain all others &#8211; these definitions just represent different, but fixed, portions of some &#8220;true&#8221; unemployment. Theoretically, one can use any definition for economic study since they are equivalent.</p>
<p>Figure 1 compares unemployment rate and the ratio of the number of part time workers (for economic reasons) and the number of unemployed according to the BLS definition.</p>
<p>Politically, in the year of elections, Democrats like the upper extreme, and Republicans &#8211; the smallest possible value. If Dems will win, one could expect the next election will bring opposite situation in unemployment definition used.(Lightly edited for this post)</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article19501.htm">Notice has been given</a> to be aware of the Winter Soldiers hearings testimony to be given March 13 to March 16.</p>
<p>On another blog it was mentioned that liberal blogs never posted videos made by terrorists that showed beheadings, dismemberments, and other atrocities. Which as far as I can tell is true. They are mostly on &#8220;milblogs&#8221;.</p>
<p>My one response was that our President has ordered that no pictures of American military be shown even coming home in flag draped coffins, much less injured. By implication I was arguing that this war is extremely antiseptic on all fronts in regard to public participation of the pain involved, and such appears to be at least familiar if not a comfortable position to maintain.</p>
<p>The fact that Angry Bear does not carry the terrorist videos because it is liberal makes no sense to me. I would think Bruno would have some thoughts on this issue as well for his station. I was wondering if he played terrorist sound tracks periodically to his conservative audience, and if not why not. It is not a fair question for him nor directed at him, but merely an idol, speculative, and throw away sort of thought in passing for him and myself for AB.</p>
<p>I know that two journalist names, Mike Totten and Dahr Jamail, seem to create a stir of passion from different people by what they report.</p>
<p>I personally am familiar with certain kinds of blood and guts, not war involved. If war is to be fought, I would expect all of us to acknowledge blood and guts. Instead it is marginalized as too &#8216;political&#8217;. Or numbers are too political. Or child deaths from diarrhea are not war related in Bahgdad (I like kids).</p>
<p>(Yet simultaneous to the war we have the sensibility of shielding people from real pictures, preferring movies and cartoons instead)</p>
<p>So when I chat with some servicemen as well, or Tx1, it makes the conversation surreal at times, especially from my particular point of view with blood up to the elbows in a figurative way, second hand, as a conscientious objector and listener. Being up to acknowledging death and injury is not our perception of men of peace or war, is it?</p>

                                <p>Here are some charts to demonstrate what I was talking about. the recent drop in US bond yields has not been accompanied by a similar drop in European rates.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9WpWVe8jEI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/kJSH2pGLGgs/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9WpWVe8jEI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/kJSH2pGLGgs/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" border="0"></a>Consequently the spread between US and foreign bonds has narrowed and it no longer compensates foreigners for the currency risk they take when investing in the US.<br />The consequences are a weak dollar. Note the opposite happened when Reagan first<br />created structural deficits and the dollar had to weaken enough to create a large enough<br />trade deficit to facilitate the capital inflow. At that point we had crowding out but it worked through the dollar to crowd out the manufacturing sector rather then the interest sensitive sectors.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9WpoFe8jFI/AAAAAAAAAKE/W6IkpKWogog/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9WpoFe8jFI/AAAAAAAAAKE/W6IkpKWogog/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" border="0"></a><br />It is also working against the Euro as you see the it strengthen when rates spreads widen.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9Wp4Fe8jGI/AAAAAAAAAKM/aCDA3v6yoRU/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9Wp4Fe8jGI/AAAAAAAAAKM/aCDA3v6yoRU/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" border="0"></a>When the US made itself dependent on foreign capital inflows the world got a lot more complex and it was no longer possible to analysis monetary or fiscal policy as if the US were a closed economy. I worry that we are now starting to see the bear case that I have worried about for years when international capital flows prevent the Fed from easing when domestic considerations call for it. I&#8217;m not making a forecast, I&#8217;m just laying out factors that make the analysis much more complex and that need to be brought into the analysis.</p>
<p>Maybe it is what we need to revive the manufacturing sector, and will be what drives the economy over the next decade. Save-the-rustbelt would love this. But, it creates inflation and real income complications for the rest of us.</p>
<p>I probably is what will happen since Don Boudreaux at the Cafe Hayek blog just got one of his letters to the FT published where he praised the trade deficit. I just base my analysis on the thesis that he is usually wrong.</p>
<p>I realize these charts are simple and the real world is more complex involving covered interest rate difference, etc, but they are adequate to make the point.</p>

<p>Just to put things in perspective, the inflation rate was 4.4%, the same as it is right now, when Nixon imposed price controls in 1971.</p>

He knew the inflation rate was slowing. But he imposed price controls as part of his package to devalue the dollar because he expected the weak dollar to be inflationary.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/09/AR2008030901427.html">Sebastian Mallaby</a> writes about how the U.S. Federal Reserve is pursuing easy monetary policy to stimulate our aggregate demand while the European Central Bank is pursuing a tighter monetary policy on the concern that Europe might slip into an inflationary spiral from excessive aggregate demand:</p>
<blockquote><p>The divergence in approaches on either side of the Atlantic is likely to stoke tensions. Americans resent Europeans for not sharing the burden of stimulating the world economy, forcing them into unilateral action. Europeans resent Americans for blundering foolishly ahead, exacerbating inflation. For years there has been an unhealthy imbalance in the world economy, with the United States contributing disproportionately to the growth in demand and doing too little in the way of saving. The response to the current economic mess increases that lopsidedness. Americans are spending heavily to head off the risk of recession while Europeans close their wallets.</p></blockquote>
<p>One would think that we were still under the Bretton Woods regime of fixed exchange rates. OK, we might have a Bretton Woods II regime with certain Asian Central Banks avoiding the appreciation of their currencies with respect to the dollar. But as our graph shows – the value of the Euro has been rising with respect to the dollar, which tends to push U.S. net export demand as it tends to push down European net export demand.</p>

                                <p>Regular readers are aware that my wife and I are currently having to deal with both <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/correspondence-with-american-express.html">identity fraud</a> and an unrelated <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/correspondence-with-american-express.html">dispute over a very large credit charge</a>, both at the same time.</p>
<p>And that got me to thinking&#8230; one of the arguments you often hear to support the charge that the US incarcerates too many people is the high proportion of people in prison who are non-violent offenders. Now, I can understand that sentiment when it comes to pot-smokers or prostitutes or the like. But as to perpetrators of fraud&#8230; well, given the experience we&#8217;re going through right now, I&#8217;d rather have gotten beaten up the street and gotten a broken arm or leg than go through this. It would have caused much less aggravation and misery. And there are only so many people that a thug can beat up on a given day, whereas those who perpetrate frauds can cause all sorts of misery to a lot more people.</p>
<p>Nobody will ever give us back the time we lost for this mess or make up for the aggravation we&#8217;ve been put through. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, people who commit identity theft should pay a price that is much greater than the one they inflicted on others.</p>

<p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/03/whatever-happened-to-inflation.html">Greg Mankiw</a> is worried that inflationary expectations are increasing and <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2008/03/the-natural-rate-of-unemployment-in-the-us-is-rising-the-fed-should-consider-raising-rates">William Buiter</a> argues that the Federal Reserve should reverse its easy monetary policy.  But didn’t we just learn that the employment to population ratio fell from 62.9% to 62.7%.  So how does Dr. Buiter reach the conclusion that the labor market is too strong?</p>
<blockquote><p>The latest labour market figures show a large fall in employment and an even larger fall in labour supply, resulting in an actual decline in the unemployment rate to 4.8%. There is also evidence to support the view that the natural (equilibrium) rate of unemployment in the US is increasing. The combination of a declining actual unemployment rate and a rising natural unemployment rate means that there are now higher domestic inflationary pressures associated with any observed level of employment and unemployment than before.  It will be argued that the labour supply data are unreliable, as they are based on the Household Survey. And so they are. But the employment data are unreliable also. And the decline in the recorded labour supply is not a one-month wonder. It has been in the data for quite a while, so I will believe it is real until I see convincing evidence of the contrary.  It makes economic sense that the US natural rate of unemployment is increasing, if only because of compositional changes in the labour force that are reducing, on average, its quality and employability. The post-9/11 imposition of additional obstacles to the immigration of skilled labour are one factor reducing labour force flexibility. So is the long-standing decline in the numeracy and literacy standards of the high-school graduates.  At the same time, the need for greater changes in the mix of skills and in the geographical and industrial distribution of employment associated with globalisation and accelerating technological change, have raised the degree of flexibility required to maintain the same amount of effective labour market pressure at a given level of the conventionally measured unemployment rate. The US is not responding, except defensively by threatening a retreat into protectionism.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/03/the-natural-rat.html">Mark Thoma</a> has an interesting discussion of how the natural rate of unemployment can vary over time but there are a couple of caveats here.  Mark is not necessarily agreeing with Buiter’s contention.  We should also note that there have been several economists (yes including me) that have advocated looking at this from a natural rate of the employment to population ratio – which admittedly can also vary over time. </p>
<p>Buiter seems to be under the impression that the all of the fall in the labor force participation rate is associated with a voluntary withdrawal of labor supply.  I have to wonder.  I have not update our graph of the labor force participation rate (LFP) and the employment to population ratio (EP), but it seems to be conveying the same message of why the unemployment rate (which is one minus the ratio of EP to LFP) is such a lousy measure of the state of the labor market.  Ever since the 2001 recession and the slow and somewhat anemic recovery, LFP has declined from more than 67% to less than 66%.  </p>
<p>Now if all of this decline in LFP were voluntary, then maybe Buiter’s argument makes sense.  I once put forth the proposition that the natural rate of EP was 64% and was accused of assuming that none of the decline in LFP were voluntary.  Maybe the truth is somewhere in the middle, which would then beg the question as to whether the natural rate of EP is some number like 63.5%, some number a bit above 63.5%, or perhaps even some number just under 63.5%.  But I find it incredulous to believe that the natural rate of EP has fallen from 64% to something near 62.5%.  Had Buiter presented clear evidence that the current EP exceeds its natural rate, I might agree for his call for tight money.  But he really has not made the case – has he?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: A little comic relief.  We know that Lawrence Kudlow has recently come down on the side of tight monetary policy as he fears inflation so it’s interesting that he agrees with <a href="http://kudlowsmoneypolitics.blogspot.com/2008/03/ryding-has-it-right.html">John Ryding</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am for economic stimulus. Don’t get me wrong. But I am for real economic stimulus which is cutting tax rates. Because this market is short of a few things: It’s short of liquidity—the Fed can deal with that. It’s short of capital. If we want more capital, we should start increasing the returns to capital, and cutting tax rates, or at least making tax cuts permanent. This is very important &#8230; You’ve got to get Washington to deliver on tax cuts and incentives.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn’t this the macroeconomic policy mix during 1981 that gave us a collapse of net exports from an overly strong dollar (something <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/kudlow-on-reagans-strong-dollar-policy_04.html">Kudlow endorses</a>) and the 1982 recession?  Of course, we could have a massive fiscal stimulus with little in the way of tight money, which might be inflationary if Buiter is even remotely correct about the labor market.  Leave it to a clown like Kudlow to endorse such a disastrous policy mix!</p>
