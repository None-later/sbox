                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Let’s compare two stories.  One seems to have Bush admitting he’s a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/24/social.security/index.html">divider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I fully recognize some in Washington, you know, don&#8217;t particularly want to address this issue,&#8221; Bush said in an auditorium at Greece Athena Middle and High School. I recognize some of them say, `Well, this is, this is a partisan thing. You know, we don&#8217;t want to make one party look good at the expense of another.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, there are sensible members of both parties who are both rejecting President Bush’s rhetoric and strong arm tactics and are looking for sensible reform.  One of them is <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7964644">Senator Lindsey Graham</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Hardball’s Chris] MATTHEWS:  Social Security, do you think the president‘s plans for some kind of personal accounts has a better shot now?  <br />GRAHAM:  It has a shot versus no shot.  And watch this group of 14 to come out with some deal for Social Security.  <br />MATTHEWS:  Really?  <br />GRAHAM:  Just keep watching.  <br />MATTHEWS:  So you think this bipartisan approach may have legs?  <br />GRAHAM:  I think this bipartisan approach will be embraced by the American people, will eventually be understood by the conservative and liberal world, and we‘re creating an environment for problem solving.  </p></blockquote>
<p>It’s about time that these folks take back their party.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_22/b3935097_mz057.htm">Howard Gleckman</a> wonders what the details of a bipartisan compromise might look like.  Short version: modest benefit cuts especially for higher income workers as well as more payroll taxes paid by this group plus add-ons but no carve-outs.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Conservative and liberal economists in Blogland have been very critical of the recent announcement from the <a href="http://canberra.usembassy.gov/hyper/2005/0322/epf205.htm">Commerce Department</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos M. Gutierrez announced today the initiation of a new system to monitor imports of textiles and apparel products. The system will allow the Department and the public timely access to preliminary textile and apparel data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (aggregated on a category basis), allowing decision makers to more quickly analyze the impact of imports on the U.S. market. &#8220;This action demonstrates the commitment of this Administration to put in place the tools necessary to enforce our trade agreements and level the playing field to support our domestic textile and apparel industry,&#8221; said Gutierrez. &#8220;We will continue to work with our domestic manufacturers and workers to give them the tools they need to compete internationally.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In a moment, I’ll try my best shot at providing at least a feeble rational for what I see as a horrific display of politics over principles.  Not that this has not been eloquently said by others, but my own reasons for saying this is a horrific decision run like this: (a) this decision makes certain developing nations a little bit poorer; (b) it indirectly hurts our export sector; (c) it raises the cost of clothing for most Americans including the working poor; (d) any possible tariff revenues will accrue to the Chinese government rather than the U.S. government; and (e) the oldie but goodie – it reduces economic efficiency.  </p>
<p>I can only imagine how a young economic advisor named Paul Krugman might have reacted to the political decisions to restrict trade by President Reagan who like George W. Bush preached free trade but ignored his own CEA’s advice to also practice it.  If I had the thankless task of writing excuses for this horrific decision, I hope I would have done a better job than <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4660294"> Carlos Gutierrez</a> in his recent interview with NPR’s Alex Chadwick.  Gutierrez seems to be saying “what we want is free and fair competition … where companies compete on the basis of their costs”.  Yet the quotas are the antithesis of competition.  Gutierrez went onto to claim that manufacturing employment is on the rise noting that unemployment is down to 5.2%.  </p>
<p>As I read the BLS data, manufacturing employment had fallen to 14.308 million by April 2005 versus 17.181 million as of December 2000.  The decline in the apparel sector was even more dramatic falling from 472.6 thousand (2.75% of manufacturing employment) in December 2000 to 261.9 thousand (1.83% of manufacturing employment) by April 2005.  To be fair to the free trade advocates, the U.S. apparel sector has been steadily declining since at least January 1990 when employment was 926.9 thousand or 5.21% of manufacturing employment.  </p>
<p>So if I had the thankless task of defending these quotas, I might start with how workers in this sector are losing jobs with little prospect of finding gainful employment elsewhere.  Yet, the apologists for this Administration are required to tell us two things that are not true: (1) the overall job market is great; and (2) government policy is committed to retraining displaced workers even though the White House is proposing to reduce such government assistance.  </p>
<p>During Reagan’s first term, one of the excuses for trade protection was the large current account deficits.  The problem with this excuse then is the same problem with this excuse today, which is simply that the current account deficits are a byproduct of the decline in national savings, which is partly due to the fiscal irresponsibility of the White House.  I guess one could argue that Asian Central Bank mercantilism is partly responsible for our current account deficit, but the <a href="http://nytimes.com/2005/05/22/business/yourmoney/22every.html">Ben Stein</a> claim that the Chinese Central Bank has a perfectly elastic demand for U.S. government bonds goes further than any economist could go without losing all credibility.</p>

                                <p>The insanity continues.  The San Luis Obispo Tribune <a href="http://www.sanluisobispo.com/mld/sanluisobispo/business/11698635.htm">reports</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Interest-only loans financed nearly 70 percent of the home purchases in San Francisco, Marin and San Mateo counties during the first two months of this year &#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  The article concludes with quotes from two economists with opposing views of the growing use of IO loans.  First, from <a href="http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/rosen.html">Dr. Ken Rosen</a> (California Professor of Real Estate and Urban Economics, Hass Business School, UC Berkeley):<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;This is frightening, frankly.  I&#8217;m worried that more and more people are using (homes) as an investment vehicle and not as a consumption market, and that&#8217;s true of the peak of housing markets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  And from California Association of Realtors economist Leslie Appleton-Young:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Given the performance of the housing market over the long-term, instruments that help people get into the housing market are a good thing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  Apparently the Federal Reserve, FDIC, Office of the Comptroller and other agencies have decided that it is possible to have too much of &#8220;a good thing&#8221;.  Last Monday, in a highly unusual move, these agencies issued new &#8220;<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2005/20050516/default.htm">Credit Risk Management</a>&#8221; guidelines for the lending industry.  These guidelines are far reaching, but two of the key areas addressed were limitations on the quantity of high LTV (Loan to Value) loans and higher qualifying standards for HELOCs (home equity lines of credit).   These same agencies plan to issue new guidelines for mortgage lenders <i>early next year</i>.</p>
<p>For a glimpse into the Fed&#8217;s thinking, see Dr. Tim Duy&#8217;s &#8220;Fed Watch: <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/fed-watch-fed-and-housing-bubble.html">The Fed and the Housing Bubble</a>&#8221; in his new post today on <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/">Economist’s View</a>.  Although Dr. Duy mentioned Chairman Greenspan’s remarks regarding housing on Friday, I&#8217;d like to include one here.  With his usual caveats, like &#8220;if there are declines in prices&#8221;, Mr. Greenspan made this comforting remark:<br />
<blockquote><em>&#8220;&#8230; only those who have purchased very recently, purchased just before prices actually literally go down, are going to have problems.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, May 20, 2005</p>
<p>Finally, I would recommend Barry Ritholtz&#8217; (The Big Picture) &#8220;<a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/05/real_estate_wra.html">Real Estate Wrap up</a>&#8221; – a series of posts and links on Real Estate (some very amusing like his coverage of this month’s Fortune Cover).</p>

                                <p>&#8230; about their Social Security money.  Via <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type">Brad DeLong</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2005/05/20/BL2005052000547.html">Daniel Froomkin</a> notes that President Bush is <em>Exploiting a Misconception</em>.  Congressman <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/21/democrats.radio.ap/index.html">Kendrick Meek</a> tells young voters the truth:</p>
<blockquote><p>MIAMI, Florida (AP) &#8212; Rep. Kendrick Meek, D-Florida, appealed to young taxpayers Saturday to oppose President Bush&#8217;s plan to partially privatize Social Security, saying they had to the most to lose from the change.</p></blockquote>
<p>Has Meek been reading <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/is-pozen-bush-better-deal-for-younger.html">Mark Thoma</a>?  Alas, <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/national-review-has-dreary-spring.html">Mark</a> endures the writings of <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200505201652.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hopes were high that little could stop the implementation of a true conservative agenda, one that featured supply-side economic reform, investor-owned Social Security reform, serious budget restraint, large-scale energy deregulation, legal-abuse-curbing tort reform, and the confirmation of pro-business, pro-life judicial nominees.</p></blockquote>
<p>What makes this spring dreary for Lawrence actually makes me glad as Bush wants legislative changes that will undermine Social Security.  As far as confirming rightwing judicial activists, he failed to explain how that would increase economic growth as he failed to explain what he meant supply-side economic reform.  The recent tax cuts have led to less national savings and Kudlow knows that President Bush is not proposing sufficient spending cuts to offset this reduction.  </p>
<p>Finally, Mark’s readers asked about the following odd line from Kudlow:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Senate, if you can believe it, just delivered a budget-busting pork-laden $295 billion highway bill, featuring several thousand special-interest earmarks and a phony tax-transfer from general revenues to the trust fund.</p></blockquote>
<p>One reader suggested that Kudlow was referring to the highway trust fund, but note the differences in what is being proposed as far as spending is small relative to the massive transfer away from the Social Security Trust Fund to give more reductions in taxes on capital income.  If Mr. Kudlow wishes to be honest with the kids – let him simply admit that reducing their future Social Security benefits is the only serious means for paying for today’s reduction in taxes on capital income.</p>

                                <p>Time for another installment in an irregular series. I thought this email said a lot about the media&#8217;s truly poor job in covering the privatization debate:<br />
<blockquote>In regards to Bush&#8217;s privorization plan for Social Security, I caught the tail end of a speech that a U.S. Senator was giving in Congress. He stated that contrary to the popular perception, the portion of the Social Security that would be diverted into private accounts would be considered a loan from the Social Security Administration which would have to be paid back with a 6 percent interest.</p>
<p>Do you know anything about this?</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we have a citizen who actually listens to speeches by senators, which probably puts him in the top 10% of the population in terms of being attuned to political goings-on (Certainly, I rarely listen to speeches by senators). And yet if he hadn&#8217;t been listening to speeches by senators, he still would not know about the clawback! How could this happen?</p>
<p>Curious, I searched a few papers for &#8220;bush &#038; social &#038; security &#038; privatization&#8221; First up, the NYT&#8217;s most recent story on the Bush&#8217;s social security plan: <strong></strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-Social-Security.html">Bush Committed to Private Accounts Plan</a> &#8212; you guessed it, no mention of the clawback or anything like it.</p>
<p>Next up, the Washington Post, where I learn that, &#8220;washingtonpost.com is undergoing maintenance and some sections of the site are temporarily unavailable.&#8221; That&#8217;s okay. I have a pretty good guess of what I would find, and would not find, were the site working.</p>
<p>Over to the West Coast, where the top hit is noted liberal Michael Kinsley&#8217;s 5/1/05 paean to Bush, &#8220;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-oe-kinsley1may01,1,2445733.column?ctrack=2&#038;cset=true">Bush Gets B+ for Honesty, Even Courage, on Social Security</a>.&#8221; I pretty much knew from the title that there was no description of the clawback, but I read it again anyway, just to make sure. No mention.</p>
<p>Now to the heartland. The Chicago Tribune&#8217;s latest is actually an interesting article, reprinted from The Nation and titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/la-na-bush20may20,1,3678268.story?ctrack=1&#038;cset=true">How Bush Makes Sure They Agree</a>,&#8221; on how the Bush team screens and selects those who get to attend his taxpayer-funded privatization advocacy trips. Yet still no description of the clawback!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s try the WSJ. Their <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB111653611045238417,00.html?mod=2%5F1132%5F1">latest is an article</a> (behind a paywall) pointing out that even Bob Pozen, author of the plan Bush recently cited as a model for privatization, does not support Bush&#8217;s privatization plan! But no clawback mention or explanation.</p>
<p>Finally, on to that font of knowledge, USA Today. The top hit there is &#8220;<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-04-28-bush-conference_x.htm">Bush: Rein in Social Security</a>.&#8221; Yet again, no clawback.</p>
<p>In each instance, I was not simply looking for the word &#8220;clawback.&#8221; Instead, I was looking for either the word &#8220;clawback,&#8221; or some description of the fact that accounts would have to earn at least 3% + inflation, probably more for 70% of workers, before workers would be better off under Bush&#8217;s latest semi-plan (it&#8217;s not really a plan since Bush still has not laid out any real details). Searching to no avail.</p>
<p>In any case, here&#8217;s my very lightly edited  response to my reader:<br />
<blockquote>Yes, that&#8217;s always been the plan &#8212; search, e.g., Google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22social+security%22+%2B+%22clawback%22&#038;sourceid=mozilla-search&#038;start=0&#038;start=0&#038;ie=utf-8&#038;oe=utf-8&#038;client=firefox-a&#038;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">&#8220;social security&#8221; + &#8220;clawback&#8221;</a>, with &#8220;clawback&#8221; being the fairly accurate term for the repayment of the loan. Under most plans I&#8217;ve seen, you are basically loaned money at about 3% and have to implicitly pay it back. Your account has to grow at a rate greater than (3% + inflation) before you would be close to better off under Bush&#8217;s apparent plan. I say &#8220;apparent&#8221; because he still has not really detailed a plan.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>A liberal suggestion comes from the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/ponnuru/ponnuru200505200751.asp">National Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>They should, rather, pass the legislation with the confidence that parents of small children are capable of seeing that even if they don&#8217;t pay income taxes now, they very well may pay them later.</p></blockquote>
<p>As soon as Mr. Ponnuru also puts on the table who will pay for all the deferred tax liabilities that are emanating from President Bush’s fiscal irresponsibility, we may have a bipartisan consensus.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Let me add a few more provocative thoughts about “globalization” today.  Again, this is partly in response to the public radio series on the subject, which has made me a bit cranky about it.</p>
<p>But first, let me change the terminology somewhat.  In the course that I teach on the subject every year, “globalization” is a term that I assiduously stay away from.  I find the term too vague, diffuse, and laden with different meanings for different people to be of much value.  Instead I prefer the term “economic integration”.  It doesn’t carry all of the meanings that some people attribute to the word “globalization”, and is a term that is much more precise and well-defined to a wider group of people, while still signifying the essence of what worries most people about “globalization”.</p>
<p>Now on to my provocative thoughts of the day.</p>
<p>1) I’m not sure why we care more about economic integration than other types of economic change.  Every time there is a technological innovation, some people benefit but others lose.  Every time a person decides to patronize one store over another, some people benefit but others lose.  Every time any economic transaction happens, in fact, there are winners and losers.  Why does it make a crucial difference whether or not that transaction happened to cross a national border?   All economic transactions, whether domestic or international, involve a willing buyer and a willing seller&#8230; and all therefore (by definition) make the parties directly involve better off.  But all also have negative repercussions on some people not involved in the transaction.</p>
<p>Clearly, some would answer, crossing a national border makes a difference because different governments might influence economic decisions differently.  True.  But realistically, most economic integration is not taking advantage of differences in governmental regulations.  The vast majority of international transactions simply take advantage of price differences: the price of labor, the price of capital, etc. </p>
<p>Furthermore, governments interfere in other types of economic change, too.  Governments may do research to encourage technological advances in one particular field, which makes an old industry obsolete and throws people out of work as a result&#8230; but does that mean that we should try to stop technological progress?  Governments may enact policies that privilege one type of industry over others&#8230; but does that mean that we should try to forbid people from changing their spending behavior?  I would argue no.  Economic change happens, and will always happen, and will always create winners and losers.  Why do some types of economic change seem okay to most people while economic integration does not?</p>
<p>2) When thinking about the costs and benefits of economic integration, why should we only consider those that apply to people in our own country?  Is there any particular reason that I should care more about the welfare effects of economic integration on people in Lubbock, Santa Barbara, or Chattanooga than the effects on people in Lucknow, Sao Paolo, or Chongqing?  Personally, I can’t think of any good reason why.  I realize, however, that this is a matter of personal preference; others may indeed genuinely care more about people living in the US than people living in other countries.</p>
<p>However, if one cares equally for people in other countries, then it is hard to think that economic integration is a bad thing.  As I just reiterated, economic change – all types of economic change – generates both winners and losers.  It is reasonable (and, I would argue, virtuous) to care about the losers from any type of economic change, including economic integration.  But one should also be glad for those that have gained.  </p>
<p>I do not rejoice over the bad luck that displaced workers in the US have had to deal with. In fact, I see the horrible consequences of it every day, living in an old, depressed New England mill town that has had an unemployment rate far above the national average for nearly two decades.  And every day I try to effect political and economic changes to help people who are economically disadvantaged through no fault of their own, but rather simply due to the never-ending process of economic change.  </p>
<p>But at the same time I recognize for every one of those mill workers who was laid off in my town, several people around the world were lifted out of abject poverty (and you don’t know what real poverty is until you’ve spent time in a developing country), and for the first time given the chance to feed, clothe, and educate their children so that they can be the first generation with a realistic chance of living a significantly better life than a medieval peasant.</p>
<p>One last word about the field economics in general.  I realize that some of you are disappointed that I agree with the orthodoxy by thinking that international economic integration is generally a good thing, despite the fact that I call myself &#8220;liberal&#8221;.  And I realize that some of you think that economists are all simply brain-washed when it comes to international trade.  But I would like to ask you to give me, and other economists, a little more credit.  We have no incentive to simply follow a “party line”, and we have every incentive to come up with a convincing counter-argument; recognition in the field comes not from repeating orthodoxy but rather from overturning it, after all.  Furthermore, anything that any economist says or writes is immediately subject to vicious and relentless criticism from the rest of the profession – that’s how all academic professions work.    </p>
<p>So if the vast majority of economists agree about something, it’s not because we are simply turning off our brains (and analytical power) on that one subject.  It’s because the theory and evidence on the subject are convincing, and have withstood relentless efforts to debunk it.  In general most economists think economic integration is a good thing, not because it’s convenient to do so, but because the work of thousands of extremely smart people working over decades has convinced us that it usually is.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that economic integration is ever painless, or always good.  But I would also say the same thing about technological progress.  And just as is the case for technological progress, I also think that in general, it&#8217;s more good than bad.</p>

</p>
<blockquote><p>Even as the young Afghan man was dying before them, his American jailers continued to torment him.</p>
<p>The prisoner, a slight, 22-year-old taxi driver known only as Dilawar, was hauled from his cell at the detention center in Bagram, Afghanistan, at around 2 a.m. to answer questions about a rocket attack on an American base. When he arrived in the interrogation room, an interpreter who was present said, his legs were bouncing uncontrollably in the plastic chair and his hands were numb. He had been chained by the wrists to the top of his cell for much of the previous four days.</p>
<p>Mr. Dilawar asked for a drink of water, and one of the two interrogators, Specialist Joshua R. Claus, 21, picked up a large plastic bottle. But first he punched a hole in the bottom, the interpreter said, so as the prisoner fumbled weakly with the cap, the water poured out over his orange prison scrubs. The soldier then grabbed the bottle back and began squirting the water forcefully into Mr. Dilawar&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, drink!&#8221; the interpreter said Specialist Claus had shouted, as the prisoner gagged on the spray. &#8220;Drink!&#8221;</p>
<p>At the interrogators&#8217; behest, a guard tried to force the young man to his knees. But his legs, which had been pummeled by guards for several days, could no longer bend. An interrogator told Mr. Dilawar that he could see a doctor after they finished with him. When he was finally sent back to his cell, though, the guards were instructed only to chain the prisoner back to the ceiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave him up,&#8221; one of the guards quoted Specialist Claus as saying.</p>
<p> Several hours passed before an emergency room doctor finally saw Mr. Dilawar. By then he was dead, his body beginning to stiffen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now anything bad that happens in Afghanistan or Iraq over the coming days will be the fault of the New York Times; anything good that happens will be due to the Newsweek <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7857154/site/newsweek/">retraction</a>, and the Bush administration&#8217;s <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/s/ap/newsweek_quran">leveraging thereof</a>.  It&#8217;s perfect.</p>

                                <p>When Senator Frist brought up the nomination of Priscilla Owen, Senator Kennedy asked if this was the same Priscilla Owen that Attorney General Gonzales had accused of judicial activism.  When <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/luskin-is-wrong-personal-accounts-do.html">Mark Thoma</a> critiqued <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200505190928.asp">this NRO op-ed</a> written by Donald Luskin:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Monday, Florida congressman Robert Wexler broke ranks with fellow Democrats by offering a plan to reform Social Security. Amazing! After months of party-line stonewalling, Wexler made a gesture of bipartisanship. And yet there hasn’t been one solitary word about it in the “paper of record,” the New York Times. This is big news. Why the silent treatment from the liberal media? </p></blockquote>
<p>I have to wonder if it is the same Donald Luskin who wrote <a href="http://www.socialsecuritychoice.org/archives/2005/05/not_exactly_a_p.php">this</a>.</p>
<p>Further down, the NRO Luskin also wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, Social Security is already running a surplus &#8211; it takes in more in taxes each year than it will pay out in benefits (it will do so until 2017).</p></blockquote>
<p>Now the person who wrote this line can’t be the same person who claimed the Trust Fund’s crisis date hits around 2011 – right?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>It&#8217;s a simple question, but I think that the answer may be less obvious than one might think.  &#8220;Globalization&#8221; doesn&#8217;t simply mean more international trade.  It doesn&#8217;t simply mean traveling more, or having better international internet connections.  It doesn&#8217;t simply mean having more cross-border investment flows.  Rather, it is some amalgam or all of these phenomena, and many more besides.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this question by a CESifo working paper that I just read called &#8220;Metrics Capturing the Degree to Which Individual Economies are Globalized&#8221; (by Riezman, Whalley, and Zhang, April 2005.)  The constant barrage of stories on my NPR station this week about globalization (part of public radio&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.thinkglobal2005.org/">Think Global</a>&#8221; project) has also helped to move this topic to the forefront of my mind right now.</p>
<p>Typical measures of &#8220;globalization&#8221; try to identify the quantity of contacts between a country and the rest of the world.  For a prime example, see the <a href="http://www.atkearney.com/main.taf?p=5,4,1,116">A.T. Kearney/Foreign Policy Magazine Globalization Index 2005</a>, which explicitly measures political, economic, personal, and technological contacts between countries.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the CESifo paper comes from a slightly different analytical perspective.  They ask the following question: how far is any particular economy from a state of &#8220;total globalization&#8221;?  By &#8220;total globalization,&#8221; the authors mean a complete absence of transaction barriers with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Asking the question this way makes an important point: the opposite of globalization is <em>national bias</em>.  In an economy that is perfectly globalized, all types of interactions with people in different countries are no more difficult, and no less common, than interactions with people in one&#8217;s own country.  In an economy that is less than perfectly globalized, on the other hand, there is a bias (which among other things could be political, technological, informational, or personal in nature) that encourages a disproportionate amount of interaction with people in one&#8217;s own country.  </p>
<p>This makes for an interesting way to think about the process of globalization.  In a sense, it&#8217;s the process of eliminating national bias.</p>
