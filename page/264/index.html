<p>I watched then read President Obama&#8217;s interview on 60 Minutes.  The following is the most telling quote:</p>
<blockquote><div>PRESIDENT OBAMA: &#8230;And, you know, I can make some really good arguments defending the Democratic position, and there are gonna be some people who just don&#8217;t agree with me. And that&#8217;s okay. And then we&#8217;ve got to figure out a way to compromise.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Respectfully sir&#8230;Your job is not Debate Club.  I can make &#8220;good arguments&#8221; also.  But, I&#8217;m not the person with the pen.  You are.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is the second most telling quote:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>PRESIDENT OBAMA: &#8230;leadership isn&#8217;t just legislation.  That it&#8217;s a matter of persuading people. And giving them confidence and bringing them together. And setting a tone. And making an argument that people can understand.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Respectfully sir&#8230; You had 52.9% of the popular vote in 2008 along with 53.18% popular vote for the House and 51.3% for the Senate.   This latest election shows that people got the &#8220;tone&#8221;.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Frankly sir, you need to legislate like you actually mean the &#8220;really good arguments defending the Democratic position&#8230;&#8221;  Otherwise sir, it&#8217;s just rhetoric.  It&#8217;s just Debate Club.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;You know&#8230;&#8221; you do actually hold as your convictions the &#8220;really good arguments defending the Democratic position&#8230;&#8221;?  </div>

                                <p>By <strong>Mike Kimel</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=214">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>One of the enduring myths about the US economy, which like most such myths is used to support a lot of very bad economic theory, is the notion that there was some sort of big economic boom at the end of World War 2. Case in point: <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/11/assorted-links-3.html">Tyler Cowen</a> links to a working paper called <a href="http://mercatus.org/publication/us-postwar-miracle">The U.S. Postwar Miracle</a> by David R. Henderson. Henderson also mentions the paper in a <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/11/the_us_postwar.html">blog post of his own</a>.</p>
<p>The download page for the paper includes a few paragraphs from the introduction which are reproduced below:</p>
<blockquote><p>We often hear that big cuts in government spending over a short time are a bad idea. The case against big cuts, typically made by Keynesian economists, is twofold. First, large cuts in government spending, with no offsetting tax cuts, would lead to a large drop in aggregate demand for goods and services, thus causing a recession or even a depression. Second, with a major shift in demand (fewer government goods and services and more private ones), the economy will experience a wrenching readjustment, during which people will be unemployed and the economy will slow.</p>
<p>Yet, this scenario has already occurred in the United States, and the result was an astonishing boom. In the four years from peak World War II spending in 1944 to 1948, the U.S. government cut spending by $72 billion—a 75-percent reduction. It brought federal spending down from a peak of 44 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1944 to only 8.9 percent in 1948, a drop of over 35 percentage points of GNP.</p>
<p>Update:  Dan here&#8230;see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/follow-up-by-spencer-to-kimels-wwll.html">spencer&#8217;s post</a> as well.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>While government spending fell like a stone, federal tax revenues fell only a little, from a peak of $44.4 billion in 1945 to $39.7 billion in 1947 and $41.4 billion in 1948. In other words, from peak to trough, tax revenues fell by only $4.7 billion, or 10.6 percent. Yet, the economy boomed. The unemployment rate, which was artificially low at the end of the war because many millions of workers had been drafted into the U.S. armed services, did increase. But during the years from 1945 to 1948, it reached its peak at only 3.9 percent in 1946, and, for the months from September 1945 to December 1948, the average unemployment rate was only 3.5 percent.</p>
<p>Ask people who lived through that period as young adults what economic conditions were like, and you will inevitably get the answer that they experienced an economic boom. The U.S. economy during the post-World War II years is exhibit A against the Keynesian view that economies will necessarily suffer high unemployment and slow growth when governments make big cuts in government spending. Why did the U.S. economy do so well in the years following World War II given how badly it had done in the years preceding America’s entry into the war? The answer, in a nutshell, is that dramatically reducing government spending and deregulating an economy can take that economy from sickness to health. In short, one of the main things a government can do to help a weak economy recover is to step aside.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paper goes on to provide more supporting material, etc., but essentially, Henderson brings up the big postwar economic boom, a boom so impressive he terms it a miracle, and then goes on to point out its proof that a big cut in government spending over a short period of time won&#8217;t cause an economic mess.</p>
<p>The following graph shows real GDP per capita (data from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2010&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaBox=no#Mid">BEA&#8217;s NIPA table 7.1</a>) beginning in 1944:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TNdN1IfazSI/AAAAAAAAAcY/P0SK2M890nI/s1600/ww1.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TNdN1IfazSI/AAAAAAAAAcY/P0SK2M890nI/s320/ww1.bmp"></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>Now, recall, World War 2 ended in 1945, at which point spending dropped a lot. But what happened to the economy? As the graph shows, what Henderson refers to as a boom or a miracle actually looks like a big decrease in GDP per capita. Furthermore, it doesn&#8217;t create the conditions for rapid growth either. The 1944 peak wasn&#8217;t reached again until 1953, and it didn&#8217;t stay permanently above that level until 1955, though it threatened to fall below that level as late as 1958!</p>
<p>Moving on, in the last paragraph I quoted from the working paper, Henderson compares the postwar economy favorably to the pre-war economy. We can compare the period from 1944 to 1960 to the period from 1929 to 1940 (beginning of the Great Recession to a year before the US&#8217; entry into the war) by indexing. The following graph shows the percentage change in real GDP per capita from the 1944 peak for every year from 1944 to 1960. Similarly, it shows percentage change in real GDP per capita from 1929 to each year until 1940.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TNdN1esgDAI/AAAAAAAAAcg/l95Bq9_yvP8/s1600/ww2.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TNdN1esgDAI/AAAAAAAAAcg/l95Bq9_yvP8/s320/ww2.bmp"></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>Notice&#8230; the economic collapse during the Great Depression was much sharper &#8211; almost twice as deep as the one that followed the end of World War 2. However, the recovery following the 1929 collapse was also a lot faster, and it began precisely (drum-roll) when the New Deal began. Whereas it took about fifteen years for the economy to move appreciably beyond where it had been in 1944, the 1929 peak was surpassed ten years later, and the economy by then was growing extremely quickly. By 1939 and 1940, real GDP per capita was expanding at over 7% a year. In fact, real GDP per capita growth rates exceeded 7% in five of FDR&#8217;s first eight years in office, and yet, the economy was poised to grow even faster during WW2. For comparison, since GDP started getting reported, there has never been a single year outside of FDR&#8217;s presidency when real GDP per capita growth rates reached 7% a year.</p>
<p>None of this should not be a surprise to anyone who read my book, or regular readers of this blog. After all, I had a post some time back looking at the recovery from every recession beginning in 1929, broken out by whether the government had decreased spending, increased spending a little, or increased it a lot. There weren&#8217;t that many recessions when the government cut spending, but in those where it did <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=15">expansions were slower and shorter</a> than when the government increased spending. The relationship between expansions and tax cuts is more clearcut; <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=3">tax hikes were associated with faster, more durable expansions than tax cuts</a>.</p>
<p>I would also note that Henderson also makes a number of comments about how the unemployment rate was very low during the immediate postwar period. I&#8217;ve noted this in posts before: Bureau of Labor Statistics figures begin in 1948. Any unemployment figures from before that time are estimates produced later, and usually using a different methodology or assumptions than those produced today, making them not entirely comparable to figures from 1948 on. But even ignoring that, people in school, in the military, and folks not looking for a job are not considered unemployed. The GI Bill put a number of people in school. As to military enrollment, according to <a href="http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1951-03.pdf">Table 248 of the 1951 Statistical Abstract of the United States</a>, it fell from 12 million in 1945 to 3 million in 1946, and then stayed around 1.5 million for the rest of the decade. By contrast, in the 1930s, the number of personnel in the military rose from about a quarter million in 1930 to 335,000 in 1939. Put another way, by putting people in school or keeping them in uniform, government government spending forced unemployment rates down by simply by keeping a lot of people out of the labor force. (Note that the estimates for unemployment during the 1930s actually go the other way &#8211; for reasons that are not obvious, people who worked for the various New Deal programs are often counted as unemployed.)</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth noting &#8211; some of the commentators to Tyler Cowen&#8217;s post also seemed to incorrectly believe that there was a post WW2 boom, though they tended to attribute that non-existent boom to the fact that the US came out of WW2 intact and went out building up other participants of the war. The fact that there are a variety of incorrect views about what happened in the past is not important. The fact that people believe in things that are demonstrably (and easily demonstrable, at that) not true is vital and unfortunate. As Michael Kanell and I point out in Presimetrics, theorizing based on incorrect facts leads to very poor theory, poor theory leads to abysmal policies, and abysmal policies lead to very unfortunate outcomes that negatively impact the lives of all of us.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Added on November 7, 7 AM:</p>
<p>Henderson notes in comments that his paper provides two reasons why GNP data (which he uses, or GDP data for that matter) was wrong during the World War 2 years, or at least not comparable with the post-War era. I had meant to mention them but forgot. Apologies.</p>
<p>Henderson&#8217;s reason 1: An &#8220;index-number problem.&#8221; As Henderson puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>When price controls were removed after the war, prices shot up. Therefore, the prices used to convert nominal GNP into real GNP made real GNP look lower than it actually was.</p></blockquote>
<p>Henderson&#8217;s reason 2:<br />
<blockquote>Second, the GNP and GDP data, which are supposed to measure the value of production, instead measure government spending on goods and services at their cost—that is, at the price the government paid for them. But we no have no idea what the value of all those goods and services bought by the government during the war was worth. So we can’t compare GNP during the war with GNP after.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both of these issues are dealt with by something made explicit in the post &#8211; real GDP per capita was essentially flat from 1947, the year the economy bottomed out according to real GDP per capita figures, to 1949. And yet, <a href="http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1674.html">price controls were lifted in 1946</a> and rationing was long gone. The production of battleships and tanks and whatnot had also run into a wall by then, in deference to the production of nylons, automobiles and meat.</p>
<p>Additionally, notice the respective trajectories of the two curves in Figure 2 after each bottoms. Notice that when growth finally began in the post-War period, it was much slower than the growth in the New Deal era. Additionally, it may not be obvious from the graph, but after 1938 growth was accelarating!. As noted above, real GDP per capita grew at more than 7% a year in 1939 and 1940 (!!!) , and at a rate of 15.9% in 1941. Realistically, we cannot attribute 1941 figures to World War 2 &#8211; the US only entered the war, woefully unprepared, on December 7th, after all. Additionally, 1941 growth, though lower than 1942, exceeded those of 1943, 1944 and 1945, when the war effort really took off. If the war was really the cause of rapid growth, 1941 would not have been that impressive, and certainly it would have been less impressive than 1943 and 1944.</p>
<p>But, let us ignore the fact that the economy really took off after 1938, and assume that the growth rate from 1932 to 1938 (the one dip during the New Deal era) had prevailed from 1938 to 1947. Since the annualized growth rate from 1932 to 1938 was (an extremely impressive) 4.7%, real GDP per capita would have been 31% higher in 1947 than in 1941. I bring that up because Henderson has this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>As noted, there is no good way to compare output after the war with output during the war because about 40 percent of wartime output was not sold in a market. But it does make sense to compare postwar output with prewar output. We can take 1941 as the last year before America’s official entry into the war because the United States did not enter the war until December 8, 1941. In that year, real GNP (in 1964 dollars) was $287.1 billion. In 1946, the first full year after the war ended, real GNP was $337.9 billion, and in 1947, it was $336.8 billion (both in 1964 dollars). Thus, real GNP in the first two transition years after the war was more than 17 percent higher than before the war.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you use real GDP per capita rather than real GNP, the difference between 1941 and 1947 figures is 20%. But&#8230; that 20% difference is only impressive if you start from the assumption that growth would have been mediocre without the war. That might be a reasonable assumption if you&#8217;re a libertarian or a conservative and have bought into the prevailing mythology about the New Deal era, but as I noted just two paragraphs up, simply extending the pattern from 1932 to 1938 would have resulted in a much bigger change between 1941 and 1947 than the one that was actually observed. (i.e., 31% as opposed to 20%) Thus, Henderson may not realize it, but he is inadvertently pointing out that at some point between 1938 and 1947, economic growth really decreased by a lot.</p>
<p>So when did that happen and how big was it? Well, we know it didn&#8217;t happen in 1939, 1940 or 1941 (growth rates exceeding 7% for the first two years and almost 16% in 1941). We know it didn&#8217;t happen from 1942 to 1944. Which leaves&#8230;. precisely the time period where the official data shows a big drop &#8211; the end of the war and the immediate war period. Additionally, since every year from 1939 to 1944 had a growth rate significantly in excess of the 1932 &#8211; 1938 growth rate that would imply 1947 real GDP per capita being 50% higher than 1941 real GDP per capita, a simple slow-down in economic growth won&#8217;t make the math add up &#8211; you need some fairly big negative numbers&#8230; and that again is precisely what the data shows.</p>

<p>Added on November 7, 9 AM:</p>
<p>Henderson also seems to implicitly assume that just because items the government spending goes into GDP at cost, as opposed to at some market price, it must imply that GDP was lower than reported. But if anything, it might indicate the exact opposite. How much would the market have valued another B-17 or rifle, without knowing whether that marginal unit was the difference between losing the war to the Germans and Japanese or not? In fact, many Americans were willing to give up huge amounts of their lives to the war effort. My own grandfather was too old to be drafted, and with two children, would have been exempt from the draft if he wasn&#8217;t too old, yet he gave up his business and took a massive paycut to tour Europe as an enlisted man from the driver&#8217;s seat of a Sherman tank. And clearly, my grandfather wasn&#8217;t alone out there. I would argue if anything, given the alternative to victory was the sort of occupation viewed in Europe and Asia, and given what Americans gave up to the war effort, the amount Americans collectively valued what the government was buying was understated by the cost the government paid.</p>

<blockquote><p>Paul Ryan is not a fiscal conservative&#8230;</p>
<p>This is further confirmed by the following:
<p>1. Paul Ryan’s main short-term suggestion in his FT piece today is: Cut taxes.  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-01/u-s-fiscal-hawks-turning-french-commentary-by-peter-boone-simon-johnson.html">Anywhere else in the world</a> you would be laughed out of the room for suggesting this as the first step towards bringing a government’s fiscal house to order.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>2. For concrete proposals on spending cuts, Mr. Ryan refers us to the Republican “<a href="http://pledge.gop.gov/">Pledge to America</a>“.  But that Pledge has no such detail on anything that would make a first-order difference, i.e., add all their proposals together and it wouldn’t even make a noticeable dent in the government debt path.  If a politician can’t summarize his main suggestions in an op ed, there are no real suggestions.</p>
<p>3. Mr. Ryan is right to bring up the need to make small adjustments to Social Security; this has been done before and makes sense.  But the major budget buster in the CBO baseline, as you get out to 2030, is Medicare.  What exactly is Mr. Ryan proposing in terms of controlling those costs?  On current demographic and technology projections – with the existing cost structure – even if you cut benefits substantially, Medicare becomes unaffordable.  Who will be squeezed over time – beneficiaries, providers, or payers – and how exactly?  This will be a tough and emotional conversation – the lobbies here are almost as powerful as banks – but Mr. Ryan is not even starting us in the right direction.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It is up to the Obama administration to explain clearly and widely why Mr. Ryan’s proposals do not deal with the first order problems that have increased government debt dramatically in the past decade and that threaten future fiscal stability.  Let us hope the White House has learned from the midterms that there are dire electoral consequences when the president shrinks from directly confronting misleading ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care: The New, New Thing Hits a Snag</strong></p>
<p>The feds are starting to push &#8220;accountable care organizations&#8221; (ACOs) as a means of improving care while bending the cost curve, and providers appear eager to join the movement.</p>
<p>Problem is, it appears ACO participants could  violate general antitrust laws and the Stark health care transaction laws.</p>
<p>Secretary Berwick (DHHS) is promising changes so ACOs can move forward. Congress currently is occupied elsewhere.</p>
<p>(Dan here&#8230;now if only we could get Rusty to say this in English with some context.)</p>

<p>I.  Private Equity, leveraged buyouts, and carried interest</p>
<p>On MarketWatch, David Weidner&#8217;s &#8220;writing on the wall&#8221; column for Nov. 2, 2010 comments on &#8220;<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/higher-taxes-for-you-while-wall-st-skates-2010-11-02">Paying for Wall Street&#8217;s Prosperity: Loophole could cost taxpayers $70 billion</a>&#8220;.  What loophole?  That &#8220;carried interest&#8221; provision that lets hedge fund and private equity managers get their compensation income with the tax benefits of capital gains rather than ordinary rates.  This isn&#8217;t chicken feed.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>There are lots of private equity deals, and private equity deals have a huge impact on ordinary Americans&#8211;for one thing, they frequently purchase by leveraging the company they buy, so that it has considerable debt the interest on which is deductible, lowering the company&#8217;s tax bills, at the same time that they frequently &#8220;restructure&#8221; so that the successor company is likely to fire lots of employees, sell some assets, and then do an IPO a few years down the road to bring in cash to pay off the debt.  And many of them will fail&#8211;including bankruptcies and going out of business. The benefit (deferral and capital gains preference) goes to the private equity firms that make fortunes out of the deal. </p>
<p>The burden is&#8211;surprise, surprise&#8211;borne by the ordinary Joe who gets fired or sees his company driven to insolvency or at the least faces job insecurity during the time that the private equity firm is whipping his company into shape for selling at a profit.  The burden is also borne by taxpayers generally and the kinds of public goods we would like to fund with tax money (from parks to disease research, from environmental enforcement to insider trading enforcement, from new roads to better cargo searches, etc.)&#8211;as Weidner notes, all those equity deals   result in firms that pay less income tax per dollar of pretax income&#8211;about 14.2% less, in fact&#8211; than their counterparts that haven&#8217;t been taken over by private equity firms, because of the way the private equity firms profit by leveraging their purchase with the company&#8217;s own cash flows.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s a pretty good argument that private equity firms are harmful to the economy, not helpful.  They for sure don&#8217;t create jobs (and often cause job loss).  And there&#8217;s prety good evidence that we create a tax break (by allowing the interest deduction for leverage used to allow private equity firms to buyout the company ) that isn&#8217;t justified.  And then there&#8217;s that tax break for carried interest.  Why are we giving so much to companies that give us back so little?  Weidner&#8217;s answer&#8211;they&#8217;ve got lobbyists. $51.5 million over the last four years  spent on lobbying, compared to a mere 7.7 million from 2003 to 2006.  Blackstone and KKR spent $3.78 million this year alone. Id.  (And they&#8217;ve got the ability to contribute money even more targeted to electing the Congress they want, after Citizens United.  $10.6 million for the midterms, through Oct. 25, Weidner reports, based on OpenSecrets.org. data.)</p>
<p>II.  the &#8220;Increase Our Taxes&#8221; Blog</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a blog I just discovered, titled &#8220;increaseourtaxes.com&#8221;.  Uneven items, but some worth looking at.  For example, see the post on &#8220;<a href="http://increaseourtaxes.com/tax-cuts-and-the-well-off/#more-906">Tax Cuts and the Well Off</a>&#8220;, which shows graphically (from the Tax Foundation) the impact of Obama&#8217;s proposed changes&#8211;mainly in higher amounts of tax from those earning a million or more, or &#8220;<a href="http://increaseourtaxes.com/california-and-the-politics-of-taxes/">California and the Politics of Taxes </a>&#8221; (nov. 1, 2010), which notes the problems that occur when &#8220;voters want services but do not want to pay for them&#8221;.   IN conclusion, he shows how all efforts to avoid taxes devastastes society.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what happens when you try to avoid paying taxes.  Politicians, hemmed in by public opinion, look even slimier as they cut deals to balance a budget.  Voters kick those politicians out but don’t change the rules of the game, so the new politicians look just like the old ones, just like in <em>Animal Farm. </em>Revenue is raised indirectly and inefficiently, distorting the economy, reducing overall income and tax revenue, and eventually requiring the government to furlough teachers and fire fighters and cut popular services.  Refusing to pay more in taxes hastens the end of exactly what we want to pay taxes for.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s short, but the gist is that Japan could increase productivity, jobs, and reduce the fiscal deficit by adopting daylight savings time. The last paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8216;The best part is that it doesn’t cost anything,” chirps Mr Alkire. “It’s a real fiscal stimulus without any money.&#8217;</p>
<p>Adopting DST would increase Japan’s GDP by more than ¥1.2 trillion (around $15 billion) annually, according to the Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute. The Japan Productivity Centre, another research outfit, reckons it could generate 100,000 jobs. Public approval for DST is growing, from 40% in the 1990s to around 60% today. Heizo Takenaka, a former cabinet minister, says it nearly passed in 2005 but fell victim to bureaucratic infighting. The bigger problem, says Mr Alkire, is that schools and firms own students’ and employees’ time. Extra daylight is less help if people are stuck indoors.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>2.  People can’t stop producing.  The time, attention and efforts of<br />human beings are expended continuously.  Their energy is like the<br />water through a hydroelectric dam – it generates electricity whether<br />that electricity is used or not.</p>
<p>3.  There are two great domains of human wealth – story, and stuff.</p>
<p>4.  Stuff is limited, immediate, distinct and substantial.</p>
<p>5.  Story [2] is unlimited in size, shape and qualities, timeless,<br />mutable and amenable to distillation.  Human beings distribute wealth<br />across time by means of story .</p>
<p>6.  One of these stories is money. Money is a creature of time. Money<br />is the story which allocates the stuff across time.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />7.  People do not need money – they need stuff.  But story liquefies<br />stuff across time and allows individuals to work, produce excess, and<br />share their excess without fear that their sharing will not be<br />returned in due time.  Time being what it is, this fear is never<br />entirely unfounded, but the shared faith in money is itself so<br />productive that the slippage is usually well compensated.</p>
<p>8.  One important class of stuff is the time, effort and attention<br />(TEA) [3]  of human beings.  These TEA elements, together measured as<br />tau, are “stuff” – real resources of real value.</p>
<p>9.  Those whose domain is rooted firmly in stuff do not hold the<br />controlling hand in repayment or just compensation – quite the<br />opposite.  Farmers and fishermen, teachers and artists, labourers and<br />healers and especially parents are instead captives to the stuff they<br />produce. The stuff each person produces is limited, but his needs are<br />continuous, multiple and urgent.</p>
<p>10. And then there are the twin motivations of love and<br />responsibility, caritas.  Witness whether work continues in the<br />absence of remuneration &#8212;  in the gap you will find caritas.  The<br />greater the caritas, the more likely the poverty of the person driven<br />by it.</p>
<p>11. Money amplifies the potency of he who possesses it, out of<br />proportion to that person’s personal tau, by shaping the efforts of<br />others in accordance with his will.  It is not, however, the only type<br />of story which can do this.</p>
<p>12. This shaping is not automatically good or bad – money may shape<br />efforts towards crime or towards charity.  Story may shape efforts<br />towards the defense of Britain or the invasion of Poland.  But some<br />patterns of shaping are more likely than others, and many of these are<br />destructive and self-perpetuating.</p>
<p>13. Stuff cannot be arbitrarily increased or erased [4], but money can<br />– in fact, strong rules must be in place to prevent this sort of<br />slippage.  There’s a reason counterfeiting is a federal crime.  The<br />production of false currency, like the writing of false IOUs, erodes<br />the faith that makes money work.</p>
<p>14. Counterfeiting money is not the only hazard.  Story of all types<br />is eroded if it is not honoured wherever presented.  Science is eroded<br />by false science, law is eroded by unjust or unenforced law, finance<br />is eroded by unequal honouring of accounts and investments.  Stories<br />themselves, the original shared memory of our species, are eroded in<br />value by false or pandering narratives.</p>
<p>15. Story manages stuff.  There is always slippage.  But when the<br />disjunct between story and stuff is extreme, at that boundary you will<br />always find violence.</p>

<p>Edited noon 11/1/10 to clarify discussion of certificates as qualified mortgages in a REMIC.</p>
<p>crossposted with <strong>Ataxingmatter</strong></p>
<p>Yves Smith has an op-ed in the Oct. 31, 2010 New York Times on the mortgage mess. See Naked Capitalism, <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/10/our-new-york-times-op-ed-how-the-banks-put-the-economy-underwater-2.html">here</a>, for full op-ed.</p>
<p>As noted, the mortgage crisis goes much deeper than just bank use of robo-signers for documents. When the securitization process took off in the early 2000s, banks became sloppy. Loan product was needed, so niceties like documentation became an expendible. Subprime loans were more grist for the mill&#8211;the faster mortgage lenders could process them, banks could buy and securitize them, the more money they could all make. Since they were selling off the mortgage loans, they didn&#8217;t care how good they were. And since they were often selling them via securitizations that they &#8220;sponsored&#8221;, they didn&#8217;t want to have to do all that legal busywork that location-specific transfers of mortgages and notes required, including payment of recording taxes in the county where the land was located every single time a loan was moved from one owner to another, though they still wanted to collect all kinds of fees from servicing the mortgage loans that they &#8220;sold&#8221; via securitization.</p>
<p>  <a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Just a little aside on the way these REMIC securitizations worked (edited noon 11/1). Often, original mortgages and notes were put in a trust and pass-through certificates were issued by the trust&#8211;this is the case in particular when Ginnie, Freddie, or Fannie aggregated a pool of mortgage loans and issued certificates representing ownership interests in that pool of loans which are treated as obligations secured by interests in real property under Treas. Reg. 1.860G-2(a)(5).</p>
<p> Certificate holders were &#8220;beneficial owners&#8221; of the mortgage assets of the trust for tax purposes, though the Trust, or the trustee on behalf of the trust, would hold legal title to the mortgage loans. The certificates, representing interests in mortgages, could then be contributed to a REMIC, or mortage loans could be contributed directly into a REMIC trust. REMIC regular interests are also treated as qualified mortgages under Section 860G(a)(3)(C), and they could therefore be contributed to another higher-tier REMIC, resulting in &#8220;re-REMICing&#8221;. The state law entity status for a REMIC doesn&#8217;t matter&#8211;trust, partnership or mere segregated pool of assets (no state law entity at all) could all elect REMIC treatment for mortgage loans under the Federal income tax rules for REMIC securitizations, if they satisfied the federal tax code requirements. </p>
<p>The requirements generally were that the REMIC had to hold only certain assets consisting of &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; and &#8220;permitted investments&#8221; (covering certain cash flow investments, qualified reserves, and foreclosure properties); it had to issue only permitted REMIC interests consisting of &#8220;regular interests&#8221; that were treated as debt for tax purposes under the tax code and one class of &#8220;residual interest&#8221; that was treated as the owner of the REMIC under the tax code (special tax rules applied to require the holders of the residual interest to report certain amounts of income with respect to the REMIC on their tax returns ); and it had to satisfy an &#8220;arrangements&#8221; test to ensure that the residual interest was not held by inappropriate organizations and that appropriate information was provided. Qualified mortgages had to satisfy a loan to value ratio and had to be contributed to the REMIC either at startup or within 90 days under a fixed-price contract OR be substituted for defective loans within 2 years of startup. If a loan were discovered to be defective after that, it would need to be sold out of the REMIC within 90 days, or the REMIC would hold a &#8220;bad&#8221; asset that could cause the REMIC to lose its qualification as a REMIC. (There is a de minimis rule that lets a REMIC hold an insignificant amount of bad assets, but that generally would not cover a REMIC with lots of mortgages that fail to qualify.) If a REMIC is disqualified, it is almost certainly a &#8220;taxable mortgage pool&#8221; under section 7701(i) of the Code that is subject to corporate taxation without the ability to be consolidated with other members of the same affiliated group.</p>
<p>Earlier private REMIC securitizations&#8211;the ones that were done in the late 1990s, for example&#8211;were careful to include detailed representations in the pooling and servicing agreement that the Depositor/Sponsor would assign the mortgage loans to the trustee for the benefit of the certificate holders&#8211;including the original note endorsed to the Trustee, the original mortgage, assignments of the mortgage, original assignment of leases and rents (for commercial properties), and original lender&#8217;s title insurance policy. The trustee was to hold such documents in trust for the certificate holders. The following is an illustrative sample of representations that would have been included in a commercial REMIC pooling and servicing agreement regarding the transfer of mortgage loans from a current owner to the depositor/sponsor who would transfer them to the trust.</p>
<p>X is the sole owner and holder of the Mortgage Loan and will have, on the Closing Date, good and marketable title to the Mortgage Loan;</p>
<p>X has full right and authority to sell, assign and transfer the Mortgage Loan as contemplated by the Mortgage Loan Purchasing Agreement; all of the obligations of X with respect to the Mortgage Loans are legal, valid and binding and enforceable against X except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization (or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors&#8217; rights, generally) and by general principles of equity; the execution and delivery of the documents contemplated by the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized and such execution and delivery&#8230;.will not constitute a violation of any federal, state or local law or the rules of any regulatory authority.</p>
<p>As of the cut-off date, the information pertaining to the Mortgage Loan set fortyh in the Mortgage Loan Schedule is true and correct in all material respects; X is in possession of a file on each Mortgage Loan containing, among other things and to the extent applicable, the note, loan agreement, mortgage or deed of trust, and all amendments, allonges or the like thereto, records of payments, correspondence, and borrower&#8217;s address and each such file will be transferred to the Trustee, and X has not withheld any material information with respect to such Mortgage Loan&#8230;</p>
<p>The assignment of the related Mortgage to the Trustee constitutes the legal, valid and binding assignment of such Mortgage&#8230;</p>
<p>But when the banks got greedy in the early 2000s, they applied that brand of &#8220;financial innovation&#8221; that was bragged about as bringing us the nirvana of a service-oriented, financial transaction-dominated economy that would grow and grow and grow. (Of course, it did at first, making lots of money for the financial institutions and particularly for investment banks. But then it crashed, costing taxpayers while banks continued to make money out of cheap (taxpayer-made-possible) credit coupled with low interest to depositors and high fees for anything and everything.) Two things began to happen. </p>
<p>1. For convenience, <strong>the assignment/allonge was &#8220;indorsed in blank&#8221;&#8211;</strong>meaning that the sponsor wouldn&#8217;t actually complete the document that transferred the mortgage loan to the trustee because it was &#8220;not practical to record mortgages in the name of the trustee&#8221; so the sponsor &#8220;retains record ownership subject to an obligation to transfer it to the trustee upon its request.&#8221; James Peaslee &#038; David Nirenberg, Federal Income Taxation of Securitization Transactions (3d Ed. 2001) at 86 n.64 (concluding that this would be done only when the sponsor was &#8220;creditworthy&#8221; and so the fact that legal title wasn&#8217;t conveyed should &#8220;not be very significant&#8221;). </p>
<p>Of course, the boom in mortgage lending, securitization glut, and ultimate bankruptcy of key sponsoring banks such as Lehman and Bear Stearns suggest that this &#8220;practical&#8221; issue had substantial consequences, at least for the legal proceedings even if not for the IRS tax status of entities (where legal title is not necessarily determinative of tax beneficial ownership). The danger, of course, is that bankrupt sponsors that retain legal title might be treated as owning the mortgage loans and the securitization vehicles to which the loans were purportedly transferred would be left with nothing, with the result that there would be questions whether the securitizations were legitimate (and if a REMIC, whether it had been disqualified from REMIC status because it had too many defective assets and therefore owed corporate taxes).</p>
<p>2. The reason it was &#8220;not practical&#8221; to record the mortgage in the name of the trustee was that there are almost always local law mortgage recording taxes to be paid every time a transfer is made. And of course, recording such taxes would be costly for a securitization&#8211;lawyer fees, servicer fees, the recording taxes themselves, document delivery and verification, etc. That would cut into the profits from the securitization for the sponsor (who might well also be the servicer). By keeping the legal title with the original sponsor, in spite of the pooling of the mortgages in a securitization, there would be no transfers until it was time to put the documents in somebody&#8217;s hands for foreclosing. That led to another financial innovation&#8211;<strong>the <a href="http://www.mersinc.org/">Mortgage Electronic Registry System (MERS</a>), invented and owned by <a href="http://www.mersinc.org/about/shareholders.aspx">Chase, CitiMortgage, Bank of America, HSBC, Mortgage Bankers Association, Fannie, Freddie, various mortgage companies and title insurance companies</a>. </strong></p>
<p>MERS apparently exists primarily to permit banks to avoid multiple transfers and multiple mortgage recording taxes in local jurisdictions where the property is located with each purported assignment of the mortgage. MERS claims that it serves to provide a consistent database that reduces errors caused by frequent assignments and reassignments of mortgage loans. See MERS fact sheet (pdf available at <a href="http://www.mersinc.org/">home page</a>). But it seems to do the opposite&#8211;eliminate the actual assignment even though securitization has moved the mortgage loan from originator to bank sponsor to servicer or whatever, and avoid the ability of anyone to know who actually owns the mortgage loan from looking at county property records. MERS indicates that it records the mortgage (in its name) and that it can foreclose on mortgage loans as the &#8220;nominee for all parties&#8221; &#8211;or the bank that claims to &#8220;own&#8221; the loans can foreclose on them. See <a href="http://www.mersinc.org/news/details.aspx?id=246">MERS statement about JP Morgan Chase</a> (Oct. 13, 2010). </p>
<p>The fact sheet further indicates that MERS expects its standing to foreclose as the agent for the noteholder to be upheld in litigation and reiterates that MERS holds legal title (which is the reason that only one recording tax has to be paid, if MERS is held valid) and that it will transfer the legal title to the servicer/sponsor bank for foreclosing if requested. (This transfer usually takes place, by the way, by the servicer bank personnel signing the indorsement from MERS to the servicer bank as an officer of MERS&#8211;another kind of robo-signing that the industry has perfected.) This does mean that many Servicers/Sponsors may have interacted with borrowers as though they held legal title when they did not.</p>
<p>As Yves Smith notes, &#8220;While a standardized, centralized database was a good idea in theory, MERS has been widely accused of sloppy practices and is increasingly facing legal challenges.&#8221; On the website, I see that MERS claims that it always has possession of the full documentation and that its arrangements for bank personnel to act as personnel of MERS are perfectly legitimate. </p>
<p>Yet I can&#8217;t help wondering, if MERS always has possession of full documentation, why are there groups that advertise their ability to create documents, as Yves Smith also notes regarding &#8220;Lender Processing Services&#8221;? Further, the idea of letting anyone represent themselves as an employee of MERS when they actually are an employee of a party that might have a reason for commiting fraud by inappropriately claiming to own a mortgage seems at least a questionable practice and one that should not be tolerated when it compromises the integrity of the mortgage system. If I were a judge dealing with one of these foreclosure cases, I would have serious qualms about accepting such a document as &#8220;proof&#8221; that a particular bank had a right to foreclose.</p>
<p>As noted, under the rules before MERS, the trust established with original mortgage loans would hold legal title, and the trust would be entitled to act on the mortgage loans on behalf of the REMIC as beneficial owner. That&#8217;s especially important, since pooled trust certificates may not be held in a single REMIC vehicle&#8211;in fact, they are often scattered in various REMICS, and in REMICs of REMICs (REMICs squared and cubed, which may themselves be &#8220;re-REMICed&#8221; in the same deal or in later deals). But if the trust doesn&#8217;t actually hold legal title&#8211;because legal title is left with MERS from the first, in spite of the documents tracing a transfer from the sponsor to depositor to trust&#8211;that means that the trust actually holds in trust no mortgage loan but only its rights under the various documents and agreements it has entered into with MERS (and that borrowers have, probably unknowingly, signed off on in borrowing to buy property from a lender that is securitizing through MERS) to be able to acquire legal title if needed and then assign it, possibly, to the Servicer who will act on the foreclosure on the trust&#8217;s behalf. </p>
<p>Do each of those assignments get appropriately recorded (and taxes paid)? Does this electronic database satisfy the state and securities law requirements? If not, the important tax question is whether this limited actual legal right supports a REMIC&#8217;s claim to &#8220;hold&#8221; qualified mortgages (aside from the question of whether these mortgages were &#8220;qualified&#8221; in the first place, in cases where appraisals were rigged and borrowers&#8217; ability to pay was unexamined)? It seems that the legal title should not be determinative for REMIC status. If the loans are defective and do not qualify as &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; for REMIC status, however, it is possible that some REMICs would have &#8220;bad&#8221; assets that would disqualify the REMIC if the loan is not sold within 90 days of discovery of the defective loan problem. </p>
<p>Moreover, if a bankruptcy court were to determine that a sponsor or other entity actually owned (not just as legal title, but as beneficial owner in the tax sense) mortgage loans that had been thought to be included in the REMIC pool (and thus the court order allocated all funds connected with that loan, or foreclosure rights and sales proceeds, to parties other than the REMIC investors), it would appear that the decision removing the loan from the pool would create a loss to REMIC investors but would not in itself jeopardize REMIC status. If the problem of non-existent documents and unverified loan quality was substantial, however, is there some possibility that the sham transaction doctrine could be applied to the REMIC to cause it to lose REMIC status ? </p>
<p>That&#8217;s a hard call but seems unlikely given the highly &#8220;constructed&#8221; nature of the REMIC as a special tax entity under the Code&#8211;any entity or even a non-entity can be given REMIC status if it meets the requirements, regular interests are treated as debt even if they wouldn&#8217;t independently be considered debt under general tax principles, residual interests are treated as equity even though they may have no entitlement to proceeds and primarily represent a liability to includes certain &#8220;phantom income&#8221; amounts in income, the sponsor may continue as servicer and continue to hold the mortgage loans (in a segregated pool) even when they are REMICed, tiering of REMICs results in a final allocation of mortgage payments that may differ considerably from the initial allocation in the first-tier REMIC, servicer and trustee actions are taken under the pooling and servicing agreement with respect to the mortgage loans according to whatever the documents permit or require (such as servicer advances to which it has reimbursement rights), etc. </p>
