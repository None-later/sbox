It seems Federal investigators want to keep her from revealing &#8220;personal information&#8221; about her (make that alleged) johns and prostitutes.  </p>
<p>Now, I can understand that people might be falsely accused of being a john, but if some Washington hack was spending quality time in the madam&#8217;s establishment, why is that something the public is not entitled to know?</p>

<p>In addition to summarizing the latest from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, you’ll note I have provided three graphs.  The first is my usual update of the employment-population ratio (EP) and the labor force participation rate (LFP).  The other two are interesting charts from AB reader Spencer (more on this later).  First the latest news:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonfarm payroll employment continued to trend up (+97,000), and the unemployment rate (4.5 percent) was essentially unchanged in February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Employment grew in some service-providing industries but declined sharply in construction.  Manufacturing employment continued to trend downward.  Average hourly earnings rose by 6 cents, or 0.4 percent, over the month.</p></blockquote>
<p>CNN just claimed that this unemployment rate is a historic low.  What can’t we have a better press?  And how does such a low increase in the payroll employment number translate into a lower unemployment rate?  Well, let’s also look at the household survey which reports that employment FELL by 38,000, which means that the employment-population (EP) ratio fell to 63.2%.  So why did the unemployment ratio fall?  Ah yes, the labor force participation rate (LFP) fell to 66.2%.  And CNN reports this is good news?</p>
<p>My graph starts with January 1997 and goes through February 2007.  Some AB readers have asked me why not go much further back.  Well – Spencer has but he has in mind something quite different that the usual and silly argument that we should compare the current state of the labor market to some historical average of something like the unemployment rate.   I have two problems with using a historical average of the unemployment rate to define something like the natural rate of unemployment rate.</p>
<p>One is that the unemployment rate is not really that informative as all does is to state the difference between LFP and EP.  The other is that these series tend to change over time in ways that are more than transitional variations.  <br />What Spencer has done is to take the trend line in EP and compare that to current EP.  His trend line would suggest that the natural rate of the employment-population ratio is near 65.3%, which of course, is higher than my rough guess that it’s around 64%.  While this is a neat contrast to those claims that we are beyond full employment, let me suggest this isn’t quite right.  LFP, which had hovered around 59% from 1948 to the late 1960’s rose rather steadily from the late 1960’s to the latter part of the 1990’s and then started hovering around 67%.  EP also tended to rise along with LFP and hit 64% during Clinton’s second term.  </p>
<p>The great labor market debate since the 2001 recession has centered on whether we should expect LFP to return to 67% or to stay at its current level.  I doubt anyone thinks that LFP would continue to trend upwards but is it now trending downwards?  Or is the current level of LFP an indication of the discouraged worker effect?  Economists may differ on this issue, but I don’t any serious treatment of the labor market would expect either the labor force participation rate or the unemployment rate to revert to some long-term average.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;ve said before, I&#8217;m not especially happy about any of the candidates running. Leaving aside silly economic policies (especially those that require hiring Mankiw and Hubbard to justify), there are personal issues. On the Republican side, it seems this is the year for adulterers running as moralists. On the Democrat side, there&#8217;s Hilary &#8211; I&#8217;m still very uncomfortable with the whole commodity trading bit &#8211; and Obama and Edwards. Here&#8217;s what I just learned about Obama: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070309/ap_on_el_pr/on_the2008_trail_38">the other day he paid his parking tickets &#8211; 17 years late</a>. All 17 tickets. Which means &#8211; he would never have paid them at all if they weren&#8217;t going to become an issue.</p>
<p>I can understand getting parking tickets. I got one once myself. I can understand not paying one or two. I imagine they can get lost in the mail, especially if incurred right before one graduates and leaves town. But at some point, this is kind of like my governator. (He would never have gotten a license to ride the motorcycle despite riding them for decades if his riding without one hadn&#8217;t come to light.) It pisses me off when folks who want to run the country act like the laws don&#8217;t apply to them.</p>
<p>Sadly, it looks like I&#8217;m going to vote for one of these people. I may even support one &#8211; as soon as I figure out which is the least bad one with the best chance of winning. Its not like there&#8217;s much choice.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>I saw this on the Washington Times page, I go there to see what the Rev Moon is up to these days.</p>
<p>Bad enough people spew on the blogs.  A special advisor to the US Air Force chief of staff, paid by you and I, does it in the Washington Times.</p>
<p>Washington Times<br />March 8, 2007 <br />Pg. 21</p>
<p>By Lani Kass</p>
<p>&#8220;Lani Kass is a professor of Military Strategy at the National War College, and is currently on sabbatical as special adviser to the Air Force chief of staff. These views are her own and do not necessarily reflect the official positions of the Defense Department, Air Force or the National Defense University.&#8221;</p>
<p>She writes:</p>
<p>“What keeps these threats at bay is the certitude that the United States has the requisite range, precision and payload to strike any target, anytime, anywhere on<br />the planet. The Navy and Air Force underwrite our long-term security while flying and fighting every day to defeat the global pansurgency, and provide our<br />undermanned and underequipped land forces a fighting chance of success.”</p>
<p>A couple dozen  more B-2’s at $2 Billion a piece; supported by a hundred new  tankers, based on old technology Boeing 767’s at a $150 Million or so a piece; with another couple of billion for “support” assets, all dragging along their huge operations and maintenance costs so we do not need rifles, armor kits for hummers and body armor!</p>
<p>Why spend thousands when the industry can make trillions of bucks.</p>
<p>World “pansurgency” a new word!!  MS word has not added it yet.</p>
<p>Fight the terrifying pansurgency at a huge,unreasonable cost and nobody asks ‘is the stuff worth the price’ or is the outcome what we expected.  The threats always, these extreme threats.</p>
<p>What are the exact threats?  Classified I am sure. Better said, “you cannot stand the truth” the threats are contrived.  The use of expensive high, tech stuff is not effective and done to justify the profits, not to perform a reasonable strategy other than to sell the high tech approach.</p>
<p>Just how much should it cost to kill Abdullah?  A million or two, no price is too high to kill a pansurgent among the warfare state beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Ms Kass apparently does not agree with the Strategic Bombing Study performed after World War II which said the cost and losses of the bombing of Japan and Germany were that effective nor did it contribute to the outcome of the war.  Or any war.</p>
<p>Disagreeing with that study is a price of entry to the Air Force</p>
<p>Next she sells a whole new order of battle.  That is a whole new set of expensive stuff to meet these awe inspiring threats that we can spend huge sums to counter.</p>
<p>“This yawning gap between global realities and our readiness to provide for the common defense must be closed. Recapitalization and modernization of the military to include true fifth-generation aircraft, capable of establishing the air dominance that is the precondition of all subsequent operations; the tankers necessary to get all our flying assets into the fight; and the helicopters to rescue crews of all services flying against advanced surface-to-air missiles are not discretionary luxuries.”</p>
<p>The implied threats, of pansurgency, if you buy them, and it is easy if you make your living dealing with threats, cause a “yawning gap”!!</p>
<p>A gap so yawning that trillions are small price.</p>
<p>Thank goodness this woman does not influence our children, only our up and coming members of the military industrial complex revolving door.</p>
<p>Not knowing a thing about technical requirements analysis, what the bad guys can actually do, Ms Kass is going to buy a few trillion dollars worth of vital<br />air power.  She cannot have my credit card.</p>
<p>Use fearsome pansurgents to sell a huge technical complex, one that is so important we will never make them pass a test or work to get the money.</p>
<p>And we cannot afford health care&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) released their <a href="http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reports_pigbook2007">2007 Pig Book</a>:<br />
<blockquote>According to the Chinese calendar, 2007 is the Year of the Pig.  Fortunately for American taxpayers, it will be a smaller pig than usual. The 2007 Congressional Pig Book has not been this little since 1999, as only two of the 11 appropriations bills were enacted by Congress and the remaining nine were subject to a moratorium on earmarks. There are no indoor rainforests, National Peanut Festivals, mariachi music grants, or teapot museums to be found.  This year’s Pig Book breaks a run of seven consecutive years of record dollar amounts of pork, culminating in $29 billion in the 2006 Congressional Pig Book. This lesser barrel of pork can be attributed to the efforts of Senators Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) and Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who prevented the enactment of nine appropriations bills in December, 2006, and the subsequent moratorium on earmarks announced and enforced by the House and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairmen David Obey (D-Wis.) and Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) in H. J. Res. 20, the bill that funds the government for the remainder of fiscal 2007. There is still enough pork to cause concern for taxpayers, as 2,658 projects were stuffed into the Defense and Homeland Security Appropriations Acts, at a cost of $13.2 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems that CAGW is giving credit for the lower pork to a few Republicans and the new Democratic leadership inn Congress.  This must have sent off alarm bells over at the National Review so they had <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZjUwMDNjYzc4ZWZhYzRlNzcyNTYzNmZkNDNkZjdmN2U=">Stephen Spruiell</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Democrats were hailed for doing more to wipe out pork in one month than the Republicans had done in eight years. But what happened can be likened to a football game: Conservatives Coburn and DeMint made the forgotten goal-line defensive stand. The Democrats scored the touchdown and took credit for the win.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spruiell goes through the history of why Congress did not pass the other nine bills as if the Republican leadership wanted to get the job down but our heroes as in Coburn, DeMint, and Sessions single handedly stopped this.  Please.  And of course, Speaker Pelosi wanted pork filled bills but she dared not to.  What a crock.  </p>
<p>Spruiell continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The bigger problem, of course, isn’t about who gets the credit. It’s about what happens when Congress takes up new appropriations bills for FY08 in a few months. “Our concern is really next year when they have all those bills up again,” CAGW president Thomas Schatz tells National Review Online. “The Appropriations subcommittees are already asking members for their lists of earmark requests. Requests are due in by March 30th, and we’d like to see what those are.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I have some good news for the good folks at CAGW.  PAYGO is back.  Of course, the National Review likely chose not to tell Thomas Schatz this very nice fact.  After all, the National Review opposed PAYGO.</p>

                                <p>A few quotes from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/08/books/08arch.html?_r=2&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">this NY Times article</a>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Now lawmakers and scholars are hoping to pry open the gateway to such archival documents by lifting what they say has been a major obstacle to historical research: a directive issued by the current Bush White House in 2001 that has severely slowed or prevented the release of important presidential papers.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>President George W. Bush’s 2001 executive order restricted the release of presidential records by giving sitting presidents the power to delay the release of papers indefinitely, while extending the control of former presidents, vice presidents and their families. It also changed the system from one that automatically released documents 30 days after a current or former president is notified to one that withholds papers until a president specifically permits their release. </p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Allen Weinstein, the archivist of the United States, said yesterday that the order was not being used to prevent presidential papers from reaching the public, but that obviously “it has been increasing the time and delays, which are endemic.” The backlog of requests for documents now extends up to five years. </p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Blanton blamed the archive’s previous leadership for initially failing to respond to added pressures on the system. But he made clear that the latest executive order has significantly worsened the problem. At a congressional hearing last week he said that waiting time at the Reagan Presidential Library had increased to six and a half years from 18 months in 2001. </p>
<p>“There was a fair, reasonable, orderly, clear, sensible and workable process for presidential records in place during the 1990s,” which Mr. Bush’s executive order “overturned and replaced with the opposite,” Mr. Blanton testified. It “is not just wrong, it’s stupid.” </p>
<p>The 1978 Presidential Records Act, part of the post-Watergate reforms, clearly gave the American public ownership of presidential papers, said the historian Robert Dallek, whose latest book, “Nixon and Kissinger: Partners in Power,” is being published next month. But Mr. Bush’s executive order, he said, has had the effect of returning ownership to presidents and their heirs.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t get this.  If the average Joe or Joette writes a memo at their office, on office stationary, while on company time &#8211; the company owns the memo.  Why is it different when GW is the Joe?  And if GW wants to keep something classified after his term runs out, and it is not something for which it can be shown that continued classification benefits the country, what right should he have to do it?  What&#8217;s in it for the rest of us, except the bill?</p>

<p>Which contrasts with <a href="http://tbogg.blogspot.com/2007/03/terence-jeffrey-vs.html">this</a> from the Army Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has subpoenaed Maj. Gen. George Weightman, who was fired as head of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, after Army officials refused to allow him to testify before the committee Monday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Committee Chairman Henry Waxman and subcommittee Chairman John Tierney asked Weightman to testify about an internal memo that showed privatization of services at Walter Reed could put “patient care services at risk of mission failure.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Three more dots</p>
<blockquote><p>The memorandum “describes how the Army’s decision to privatize support services at Walter Reed Army Medical Center was causing an exodus of ‘highly skilled and experienced personnel,’” the committee’s letter states. “According to multiple sources, the decision to privatize support services at Walter Reed led to a precipitous drop in support personnel at Walter Reed.”</p>
<p>The letter said Walter Reed also awarded a five-year, $120-million contract to IAP Worldwide Services, which is run by Al Neffgen, a former senior Halliburton official.<br />They also found that more than 300 federal employees providing facilities management services at Walter Reed had drooped to fewer than 60 by Feb. 3, 2007, the day before IAP took over facilities management. IAP replaced the remaining 60 employees with only 50 private workers.</p>
<p>“The conditions that have been described at Walter Reed are disgraceful,” the letter states. “Part of our mission on the Oversight Committee is to investigate what led to the breakdown in services. It would be reprehensible if the deplorable conditions were caused or aggravated by an ideological commitment to privatize government services regardless of the costs to taxpayers and the consequences for wounded soldiers.”</p>
<p>The letter said the Defense Department “systemically” tried to replace federal workers at Walter Reed with private companies for facilities management, patient care and guard duty – a process that began in 2000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Long time readers may recall I had a post looking at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/public-healthcare-expenditures-and.html">correlations between government’s share of the healthcare dollar and the rise in healthcare costs</a>.  To quote myself:</p>
<blockquote><p>The correlation between the government’s share of the nation’s healthcare expenses and the rate at which these expenses rise is negative. In plain English – the more involved the government gets in healthcare, the slower the healthcare costs rise. Sure, correlation is not causality, but if private health insurance was the panacea the president makes it out to be, the correlation between government involvement in healthcare and the rate at which healthcare costs increase should be positive. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>The Ex-Girlfriend’s post about free stuff got me thinking.  While people might drive an hour or more to pick up $15 bookshelves for free, and thus spend more on gas and their time than the bookshelves than their time is worth, they don’t react that way to everything.  Here in Los Angeles, there are often free movie screenings.  Audience reactions have to come from somewhere, after all.  </p>
<p>There’s an AMC theater close to where I used to live that is always packed on weekends.  And on weekends, there was always a guy in front of the place, with a clipboard, trying to interest people in watching these free movies that hadn’t come out yet.  Sure, some no doubt were future bombs, but the guy was often peddling tickets to movies with big stars too.  (Not that those don’t sometimes bomb.)  The one negative – the viewings were on a Tuesday night.  </p>
<p>Now, granted, Tuesday night is a work-night or school-night for most people, especially those willing to pay $10 or $11 a ticket on Friday or Saturday night.  (Price discrimination, anyone?)  But how few people are willing to go that they have to give those tickets away for free?  Why are people willing to waste 2 hours and change driving to pick up “free bookshelves” and not waste 2 hours sitting in an air conditioned theater watching a soon to come out movie?</p>

                                <p>This post is by reader Ole Keynesian.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>In <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/ole-keynesian-on-cost-of-everyday.html">my last post</a> I walked through a simple scenario to show how a recycling decision may or may not change if economics is left out of the equation.  It&#8217;s virtually impossible to ignore economics on the big questions (carbon sequestration, desalinization, buying a hybrid car), but if a purely environmental thought process is used at the micro level, where money isn&#8217;t an issue, perhaps we can discover ways to think differently at the macro level as well.</p>
<p>The thermostat in the hallway says 65.  I&#8217;d rather it said 68.  I only have two choices &#8211;  raise the thermostat to 68 and let the miracle of natural gas take over, or build a cozy fire in the woodstove.</p>
<p>The natural gas for the furnace is delivered under pressure by pipeline from a &#8220;gathering system&#8221; which may be <a href="http://www.aga.org/Content/ContentGroups/Home_Page/Limelight/How_Does_The_Natural_Gas_Delivery_System_Work_.htm">hundreds of miles from my home</a>.</p>
<p>Yow!  That&#8217;s more information than I really wanted.  So the incremental environmental cost of getting that fuel to me includes the incremental portion of the energy used to build the transmission system, the gathering system, the compressor stations, the computer systems used to regulate the distribution, etc.  The burning process releases exhaust gasses, more or less depending on the type of furnace I&#8217;m using.</p>
<p>The wood for the woodstove didn&#8217;t just fall to earth in 16 inch rounds.  I either  cut it with a handsaw and split it with an awl (yeah, right), or I bought it from someone who drove his truck out into the woods, cut and split it with a chainsaw, and delivered it to me in the same truck.  OK, there&#8217;s the gasoline used for the truck and the chainsaw, the exhaust produced by both, and the incremental rubber left on the road from the two truck trips, among other things.  When I burn the wood, if the stove is efficient it will burn very hot and minimize the carbon deposits in the flue.  Either way, a <a href="http://www.woodheat.org/environment/smoke.htm">a chemical stew</a> billows out of the chimney.     </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t regulate the woodstove temperature as easily as I can the gas furnace, so it will probably be 70 degrees in the house before the fire gets banked down.</p>
<p>So which way is better? It sounds like gas heat is less environmentally damaging overall, but does the answer change if I need to raise the temperature twenty degrees instead of three?  Or if I have a pellet stove?  Or if the furnace is propane?  Or electric?  How about an electric space heater?</p>
<p> I think I&#8217;ll just put on another sweater.  Hmmm&#8230; was it made in China?</p>
