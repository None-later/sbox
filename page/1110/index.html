                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><em>The Economist</em> notes some gathering distress over the <a href="http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3306218">price of oil</a>.  But Greenspan, in <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/200410152/default.htm">a speech last Friday</a>, presented another incarnation of his seemingly boundless optimism.  Some highlights from his speech:</p>
<blockquote><p>While there are concerns of seeming inadequate levels of investment to meet expected rising world demand for oil over coming decades, technology, given a more supportive environment, is likely to ensure the needed supplies, at least for a very long while.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;re not going to run out of oil any time soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>[L]ong-term price tranquility has faded dramatically over the past four years. Prices for delivery in 2010 of light, low-sulphur crude rose to more than $35 per barrel when spot prices touched near $49 per barrel in late August. Rising geopolitical concerns about insecure reserves and the lack of investment to exploit them appear to be the key sources of upward pressure on distant future prices. However, the most recent runup in spot prices to nearly $55 per barrel, attributed largely to the destructive effects of Hurricane Ivan, left the price for delivery in 2010 barely above its August high. This suggests that part of the recent rise in spot prices is expected to wash out over the longer run.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: the main reason for the spike in oil prices right now is Hurricane Ivan, so we&#8217;ll see prices fall substantially again soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, despite its recent surge, the average price of crude oil in real terms is still only three-fifths of the price peak of February 1981. Moreover, the impact of the current surge in oil prices, though noticeable, is likely to prove less consequential to economic growth and inflation than in the 1970s. So far this year, the rise in the value of imported oil&#8211;essentially a tax on U.S. residents&#8211;has amounted to about 3/4 percent of GDP. The effects were far larger in the crises of the 1970s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: don&#8217;t worry.  Even though the US has essentially paid the equivalent of an $85 billion tax increase due to higher oil prices this year, things aren&#8217;t as bad as they were during the 1970s.  </p>
<p>As an aside, I wonder how Greenspan would have reacted to a proposal to raise income taxes by $85 billion this year?  Would he have dismissed its economic effects just as casually?</p>
<p>Finally, for those who like keeping track, here&#8217;s the latest update in oil prices since the start of 2004.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The other day, my 10 year old niece asked me why I am going to vote for John Kerry.  I must admit that I was at a bit of a loss.  I didn’t know where to begin.  There are so <em><strong>many</strong></em> ways in which I prefer Kerry to Bush, after all, so I found it surprisingly tricky to give a concise answer.  </p>
<p>All of us here at Angry Bear have written dozens of posts identifying specific problems with Bush&#8217;s presidency, specific examples of how Bush does not make a good president, or specific improvements in policy that Kerry would implement if he’s elected.  But my niece&#8217;s question started me wondering: is it possible to summarize and consolidate all of those dozens of individual facts into a coherent, concise statement about why I’m voting for John Kerry?  The <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> is in the midst of a similar exercise, but they’re coming up with <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/special_packages/endorsement/">21 reasons to vote for Kerry</a> over Bush.  I feel like that’s too many; if you can come up with 21 reasons, why not 121?  Surely they exist.  </p>
<p>No – I’m convinced that it should be possible to whittle things down further.  So here’s my attempt.  I’ve arbitrarily decided to boil things down to just five major points. (I was initially trying to get it down to just three reasons, but in the end I couldn’t be that constrained.)  In order of increasing importance they are:
<ol>
<li>The economy: Bush&#8217;s economic policies to address the recession were awful, indicating a deep lack of understanding of how the economy works, in addition to a lack of trust in well-respected economic advisors.</p>
</li>
<li>Iraq: Bush&#8217;s biggest decision – invading Iraq – displayed poor judgment on his part, in part because it reflected Bush’s dangerous propensity to make decisions based on ideology rather than fact.
</li>
<li>Democracy: The Bush administration has had an unprecedented penchant for censoring information (often by rewriting history) and stifling democratic dissent, imposing substantial new constraints on the functioning of the democratic process.
</li>
<li>The budget: Kerry will restore fiscal discipline to Washington, and thus staunch the flow of IOUs that Bush is currently handing to my 2 year old daughter.
</li>
<li>Terrorism: Kerry will fight terrorism more effectively than Bush is able to, by leading a united coalition of all of the world’s major democracies, as well as by marginalizing violent Islamic fundamentalists rather than turning them into local heroes as Bush does.</li>
</ol>
<p>To whittle it all down to just these five points I had to leave out a lot of incredibly important reasons to vote for Kerry over Bush: health care, the growth of corporate power and influence, the unprecedented disregard for scientific research in the policy process in the Bush administration, Bush&#8217;s general reliance on ideology over empirical facts in decision-making, environmental protection, and education, to name just a few.</p>
<p>But after putting all of those other things aside, I think that I’ve reduced things down to what are for me the five most important things that this election is about.  Over the next week I’m going to write up my specific arguments for each of those five reasons to vote for Kerry, as an exercise in synthesizing and summarizing some of the myriad of individual facts that we&#8217;ve noted over the past three years.  I think it&#8217;s helpful to do this, because sometimes I think that we focus so much on the trees that we forget about the forest, so to speak.  It&#8217;s good to remind ourselves of the broad, over-arching reasons why Kerry will be a better president than Bush has been.</p>
<p>By the way, if you want to play at home, the rules are simple: come up with a list of the five (or fewer, if you can do it) most important reasons to vote for Kerry over Bush.  Personally, I think you should also consider how you could support your assertions with concrete documentary evidence, but maybe that&#8217;s the teacher in me talking.  Most importantly, your list should simply reflect what you think is at the heart of this election.</p>
<p>Have fun.  I&#8217;ll be back with my argument about the economy tomorrow.</p>

However, Greenspan said the vast majority of U.S. consumers &#8220;appear able to calibrate their borrowing and spending to minimize financial difficulties.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Joe Trippi promotes a book by Joe Scarborough: <em>Rome wasn&#8217;t burnt in a day: The Real Deal on how politicians, bureaucrats, and other Washington barbarians are bankrupting America </em>with a summary that can be found <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5932469">here</a> and includes:</p>
<blockquote><p>In just three years since George W. Bush was elected president, your Republican-run Congress took a $155 billion surplus and turned it into a staggering $455 billion deficit. These self-described conservatives did it in part by passing a staggering array of pork-barrel bills, billion-dollar farm subsidies, and trillion-dollar entitlement programs that America cannot afford. At the same time, Republican congressmen voted into power in 1994 under the platform of cutting wasteful Washington spending have worked with liberal Democrats to strap you and your unsuspecting fellow Americans over the course of the last decade with the largest annual budget deficit and federal debt in the history of the United States. Most get reelected with ease by telling the folks back home that they still support smaller government and balanced budgets. But when they return to Congress, these politicians meekly fall in line. That is why the U.S. National Debt Clock in New York City blinked wildly out of control as it streaked somewhere north of $7 trillion…You now pay for their carelessness every time you pay your monthly credit card bill, student loan, car lease, or home mortgage. Just as economists have been predicting for years, Washington’s runaway deficits are now causing interest rates to move back up. As investment guru Steven Rattner recently told the New York Times, “The question is not whether interest rates will continue to go up. But rather how far and how fast.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Trippi’s discussion can be found <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6254868">here</a> including:</p>
<blockquote><p>Treasury Secretary John Snow asked them to raise the limit back in August – but President Bush and the Republican leadership were hoping they could wait until after the election and avoid calling attention to our nation’s fiscal woes under their policies prior to Americans going to the polls on Nov. 2nd. Now, a President who has not vetoed a single spending bill, and wants to make trillions in tax cuts permanent, is asking Congress once again to borrow money from retirement trust funds to keep the federal government operating. And still, President Bush had no qualms questioning the fiscal sanity of Senator Kerry’s record in Wednesday’s debate…Yet the fact is it is the president&#8217;s record does not match his rhetoric, regardless of his Tempe tantrum on that issue. Right now there isn’t a lot of fiscal sanity coming from either side of the spectrum. But given a choice between the fiscally blind Bush administration and the fiscally one-eyed John Kerry, Kerry&#8217;s the one talking some sense.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even the Miami Herald gets in on this bipartisan criticism of Bush’s fiscal insanity with <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/business/9932823.htm?1c">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Experts note, however, that Bush has proven a lavish spender as president and, in fact, has never vetoed a spending bill. In fiscal 2004, when federal revenue actually rose 5 percent, spending shot up 6.3 percent…Bob Bixby concurs. He is the executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group that urges balanced budgets and fiscal discipline. &#8220;We should have some sort of short-term plan to balance the budget again, some multiyear plan to try to get the budget back in balance about the time boomers begin to retire,&#8221; he said. Beyond economic considerations, Bixby views the deficit as a reflection of a fundamental flaw in how Washington governs: a lack of will to draw the line defining what&#8217;s affordable and what isn&#8217;t. As he puts it, &#8216;deficits are often a symptom of politicians&#8217; failing to pay for governments they enact.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So President Bush has no plans to either cut spending or raise taxes, but he did find time to accuse Senator Kerry of fiscal insanity.<br /></p>

                                <p>The BLS just released the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">September CPI report</a>.  It shows a bit of an uptick in the core rate of inflation (mostly due to an increase in the price of &#8220;lodging away from home&#8221;), which may be a signal that the economy is at least not weakening further.  The rate of overall inflation was also moderate in September, though the surge in oil prices have still caused fairly large year-over-year price changes in recent months, as the picture below shows.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/cpi_sept.jpg"></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see the core rate of 12-month CPI changes stick at around 2.0% for a few more months, as an indicator of good health in the economy. October&#8217;s report is likely to be dominated by sharply higher energy costs, which will have competing effects on the core rate: to some degree higher energy costs spill over into other prices, which may boost the core rate; but higher energy costs also slow the economy, which tends to slow the core rate of inflation.  Your guess is as good as mine as to which force will win.</p>

                                <p>This <em>Meet the Press </em><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6267835">interview</a> with Ken Mehlman and Bob Shrum is a joy to read.  Shrum asked Mehlman several times how Bush plans to pay for his Social Security ideas and each time Mehlman ducked with the usual lame attack Kerry by all those votes for tax increases.  But the real fun started when Tim Russert wanted to talk abot the flu vaccine shortage. Here was the exchange:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mehlman: The reason that we have the situation we have today is very simple.  There are two manufacturers in the world that provide this flu vaccine. Congress tried to act on it in 2003 with legislation called The Health Act that, among other things, reduced liability for flu vaccine manufacturers.  Why is that so important?  Because there&#8217;s a very small profit if you&#8217;re making flu vaccines and liability is a real issue.  What did John Kerry do?  Well, he missed the vote and came out against it.  There&#8217;s another example where John Kerry, as he&#8217;s done on so many issues, has taken the sides of wealthy trial lawyers, personal injury trial lawyers, as opposed to taking the sides of doctors and patients and public health &#8230;</p>
<p>Shrum:  Well, first of all, they think lawsuits cause hurricanes.  It&#8217;s their answer to everything that&#8217;s a problem in America today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, Mehlman did not take a chance to read this <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_10/004936.php">discussion</a> from Kevin Drum.  </p>
<p>And Mehlman’s claim that only two manufacturers in the world produce flu vaccine was rebutted by Chef Ragout <a href="http://ragout.blogspot.com/2004/10/flu-vaccine-shortfall-yet-again.html">here</a>.  Kevin updates his discussion today by noting that other companies are entering the flu vaccine market.  </p>
<p>If this Administration is so clueless as to the number of vaccine producers or the potential for new entry, should we be surprised that the U.S. is facing a shortage.  Of course, Kevin argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FDA has a famously tight regulatory regime, made even tighter in the late 90s, and as a result the United States has only two approved manufacturers of flu vaccine while Britain has half a dozen.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> CNN is reporting that HHS Sec. Tommy Thompson is assuring us that there is no flu vaccine crisis.  Oh, it would be too easy to comment&#8230;</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Last week, I posted a table showing average monthly job creation for each year from 1959 to the present (see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/10/job-growth-in-perspective-part-i.html">Job Growth in Perspective, Part I</a>). At the time, I posed the following question:
</p>
</p>
<p align="center"><i>We all know that Bush is the first president since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs over the entire course of his administration. That&#8217;s clearly bad, but how bad is it?
</p>
<p></i></p>
</p>
<p>Beyond presenting the raw data, color-coded and arranged by administration, I didn’t do much in the way of interpreting the results. So here is what stands out to me:<br />
</p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Recessions happen, and their onsets are not necessarily, nor even generally, the fault of the president. Ford had two pretty bad years, 1974 and 1975, caused by oil shocks about which he could do little. Similarly, Reagan’s first two years were also quite bad for reasons largely beyond his control. On balance, when a president claims that he’s not responsible for the <i>onset</i>      of a recession, there’s a reasonable chance he’s correct.</p>
</li>
<li>The      same does not apply, however, to the <i>duration      </i>of a recession. Presidents have a number of tools at hand that they can apply, if they so choose, to shorten the rough patches: they draft the budget; their vetoes signal how much and what types of spending are allowed; they have the bully pulpit (calls for new spending or tax cuts are more compelling when made during a recession); they can also pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. While Congress has direct control over the spending, the idea that the man often called the “Leader of The Free World” lacks great power to shape spending and tax levels is laughable.
</li>
<li>Every administration since 1959, save this one, has wielded these tools effectively. Until the current administration, no period coded as “Poor” (orange) or “Terrible” (red) job growth &#8212; categories that collectively indicate monthly job growth in a year below 0.02% &#8212; lasted more than two years. President Bush is the only one of the last 10 presidents to have three consecutive poor or terrible job creation years in a row. In none of his first three years did Bush manage to have positive job growth; not in the private sector, and not overall. This has not happened since the eve of the Great Depression.
</li>
<li>In his first three years, Carter was a job-creating machine. But his final year, 1980, was bad, with job growth barely above zero. As a result, the common wisdom is that the economy was generally very bad under Carter. The truth, however, is that Carter’s <i>worst</i> year was better than each of      Bush’s first three years.</li>
<p>
<li>Are      things turning around now? Is it in fact impressive that, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/economy/">as Bush often states</a>, there have been “over 1.9 million jobs created since August 2003, with 13 straight months of job gains”? In fact, the historical rate of monthly job growth, in the private sector and overall, from 1959 to the present is 0.17%, which in today’s numbers would be about 185,000 workers per month. In Bush’s best year so far, 2004, he’s averaged a 0.13% monthly increase in private sector jobs and a 0.15% monthly increase in jobs overall (growth in government accounts for the difference.) The historical average is 0.17%. Stated differently, in his best year ever, President Bush’s job creation record is slightly below average.<br />
</li>
<p>
<li>The period spanning Carter’s last year and Reagan’s first two, 1980-1982, looks pretty bad as well, but Bush’s job market is worse. When the economy finally recovered in 1983, the job market took off (unlike today), with job growth surging a full standard deviation above the historical average. At least with Reagan, the massive deficits actually gave a decent bang for the buck in terms of creating jobs. Once again, the President Bush has managed to make me look back fondly on Ronald Reagan’s administration.</p>
</li>
<li>In terms of job creation, the 1960s really were an amazing decade, averaging 0.25% monthly job growth. As I recall, the 1960s were also a time of war. So the claim sometimes floated these days that job growth and war are incongruous is pure nonsense. In fact, I believe Franklin Roosevelt also managed to simultaneously fight a war and create a few jobs. Same goes for Truman, Ike, and Nixon. </li>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Some years ago, I briefly worked in a supermarket produce section. One of my duties was to remove spoiled fruits and vegetables from the display bins, to be discarded or donated to a homeless shelter.</p>
<p>The supermarket business is known for having <a href="http://www.fmi.org/facts_figs/CompetitionandProfit.pdf">razor-thin profit margins</a>.  Grocers face <a href="http://www.nfsi.org/walmart/Lawsuits%20a%20volume%20business%20at%20Wal-Mart.htm">serious liability issues</a>, with <a href="http://www.nfsi.org/law_article/law_com%20-%20Florida.htm">slip-and-fall lawsuits</a> alone costing about half a billion dollars a year. Supermarkets are also groaning under the heavy burden of OSHA, FDA, local health and weight-and-measure regulations, and other crazy liberal schemes.</p>
<p>So with the added burden of losses on unsold fruits and vegetables, it&#8217;s no wonder that grocers have been leaving the business in droves, leading to periodic shortages of fruits, vegetables, and food of all kinds. In many cities, rates of malnutrition and even starvation have been heading ever upwards. Long lines of hungry people snaking around the block have become a common sight in front of the few remaining supermarkets.</p>
<p>Or at least I assume that this must be happening. After all, I keep reading article after article offering these same explanations&#8211;the cost of unsold product, misregulation, liability issues&#8211;for why the US faces such persistent flu vaccine shortages.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://ragout.blogspot.com/2004/10/flu-vaccine-shortfall-yet-again.html">written before</a>, and will again, these explanations are mostly nonsense (with the possible exception of misregulation). I wasn&#8217;t privy to the pricing decisions of the market I used to work at, but I imagine they simply raised the price high enough to cover their losses in spoiled produce. Similarly, I imagine that vaccine manufacturers simply raise the price to cover unsold serum and the costs of liability and regulatory compliance. Indeed the price of flu vaccine has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/health/17flu2.html?ei=5094&#038;en=d2dfea7c2bb70b63&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;hp=&#038;ex=1098072000&#038;partner=homepage&#038;pagewanted=all&#038;position=">increased almost five-fold</a> since 1996, from $1.80 to $8.50 a dose.</p>
<p>One explanation for persistent vaccine shortages that hasn&#8217;t gotten enough attention is the possibility of price fixing. Perhaps firms have been withholding supplies in order to raise prices, gain regulatory and liability relief; and persuade governments of the need for subsidies.</p>
<p>Paranoid? It was only a few years ago that many of the worlds largest drug companies admitted to engaging in a decade-long conspiracy to fix the price of vitamins. Eight firms were fined about $1.5 billion dollars by <a href="http://www.bulkmsm.com/research/page5.htm">US</a> and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicalscience/story/0,1129,603206,00.html">EU</a> regulators.   The plot was quite brazen:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/health/vitamins/index.html">[Executives] secretly met</a> in hotels and homes around the world. Instead of competing for business, they agreed on how much of each product they would sell and how much they would charge for it.</p>
<p>An FBI investigation resulted in rare behind the scenes video. The video shows executives from multinational firms agreeing to fix global prices for an additive in animal feed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of the firms that were caught, at least three &#8212; Aventis SA (France), Solvay Pharmaceuticals (Holland), and Merck (Germany) &#8212; are major vaccine manufacturers. Aventis, of course, is one of the 2 US suppliers of injected flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as Aventis said at the time, they&#8217;ve &#8220;since put into place practices and procedures and organizational changes to ensure compliance with applicable antitrust laws.&#8221; So there&#8217;s certainly no need to worry that they&#8217;re up to their old tricks again.</p>

                                <p>His latest Bush exegesis, Without a Doubt, in tomorrow&#8217;s New York Times is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html?oref=login&#038;oref=login&amp;pagewanted=all&#038;position">online now</a>:<br />

<blockquote>Bruce Bartlett, a domestic policy adviser to Ronald Reagan and a treasury official for the first President Bush, told me recently that “if Bush wins, there will be a civil war in the Republican Party starting on Nov. 3.” The nature of that conflict, as Bartlett sees it? Essentially, the same as the one raging across much of the world: a battle between modernists and fundamentalists, pragmatists and true believers, reason and religion.</p>
<p>“Just in the past few months,” Bartlett said, “I think a light has gone off for people who&#8217;ve spent time up close to Bush: that this instinct he&#8217;s always talking about is this sort of weird, Messianic idea of what he thinks God has told him to do.” Bartlett, a 53-year-old columnist and self-described libertarian Republican who has lately been a champion for traditional Republicans concerned about Bush&#8217;s governance, went on to say: “This is why George W. Bush is so clear-eyed about Al Qaeda and the Islamic fundamentalist enemy. He believes you have to kill them all. They can&#8217;t be persuaded, that they&#8217;re extremists, driven by a dark vision. He understands them, because he&#8217;s just like them. . . .</p>
<p>“This is why he dispenses with people who confront him with inconvenient facts,” Bartlett went on to say. “He truly believes he&#8217;s on a mission from God. Absolute faith like that overwhelms a need for analysis. The whole thing about faith is to believe things for which there is no empirical evidence.” Bartlett paused, then said, “But you can&#8217;t run the world on faith.” </p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s long, but the full article definitely looks worth reading.</p>

                                <p>Regular readers know that I&#8217;m a big fan of The Daily Show With Jon Stewart. Well apparently, Stewart and Tucker Carlson had a bit of a to-do today on Crossfire. <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/archives/breaking-jon-stewart-states-the-obvious-023528.php">Wonkette reports</a> the following exchange:<br />
<blockquote>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Tucker:</strong> You always scold people like this at dinner at your house?</p>
<p><strong>Jon:</strong> If they have a show that&#8217;s as stupid as this one.</p>
<p><strong>Tucker: </strong>You know, you&#8217;re not as fun as you are on your tv show.</p>
<p><strong>Jon:</strong> You know what, you&#8217;re just as big a dick as you are on your tv show.</p>

<p> I&#8217;m off to set my Tivo for the next Crossfire airing.</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>UPDATE: It looks like I&#8217;m too late to catch a re-airing, but here are some highlights from <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html">the transcript</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote> STEWART: &#8230; In many ways, it&#8217;s funny. And I made a special effort to come on the show today, because I have privately, amongst my friends and also in occasional newspapers and television shows, mentioned this show as being bad.</p>
<p>BEGALA:  We have noticed.</p>
<p>STEWART: And I wanted to &#8212; I felt that that wasn&#8217;t fair and I should come here and tell you that I don&#8217;t &#8212; it&#8217;s not so much that it&#8217;s bad, as it&#8217;s hurting America.</p>
<p>CARLSON:  But in its defense&#8230;</p>
<p>STEWART:  So I wanted to come here today and say&#8230;</p>
<p>STEWART:  Here&#8217;s just what I wanted to tell you guys.</p>
<p>  CARLSON:  Yes.</p>
<p>  STEWART:  Stop.</p>
<p>STEWART:  Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting America.  </p></blockquote>
<p>**************<br />
<br />
<blockquote>STEWART: See, the thing is, we need your help. Right now, you&#8217;re helping the politicians and the corporations. And we&#8217;re left out there to mow our lawns.</p>
<p>  BEGALA:  By beating up on them?  You just said we&#8217;re too rough on them when they make mistakes.</p>
<p>STEWART: No, no, no, you&#8217;re not too rough on them. You&#8217;re part of their strategies. You are partisan, what do you call it, hacks.</p></blockquote>
<p>**************<br />
<br />
<blockquote> STEWART: It&#8217;s not honest. What you do is not honest. What you do is partisan hackery. And I will tell you why I know it.</p>
<p>  CARLSON:  You had John Kerry on your show and you sniff his throne and you&#8217;re accusing us of partisan hackery?</p>
<p>  STEWART:  Absolutely.</p>
<p>  CARLSON:  You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me.  He comes on and you&#8230;</p>
<p>STEWART:  You&#8217;re on CNN.  The show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls.</p>
<p>STEWART:  What is wrong with you?<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>****************<br />
<br />
<blockquote>STEWART: You know, the interesting thing I have is, you have a responsibility to the public discourse, and you fail miserably.</p>
<p>  CARLSON:  You need to get a job at a journalism school, I think.</p>
<p>  STEWART:  You need to go to one.</p>
<p>  The thing that I want to say is, when you have people on for just knee-jerk, reactionary talk&#8230;</p>
<p>  CARLSON:  Wait.  I thought you were going to be funny.  Come on. Be funny.</p>
<p>  STEWART:  No.  No.  I&#8217;m not going to be your monkey.  </p></blockquote>
<p>*****************<br />
<br />
<blockquote>CARLSON:  I do think you&#8217;re more fun on your show.  Just my opinion.</p>
<p>CARLSON:  OK, up next, Jon Stewart goes one on one with his fans&#8230;</p>
<p>STEWART:  You know what&#8217;s interesting, though?  You&#8217;re as big a dick on your show as you are on any show.</p>
<p>CARLSON:  Now, you&#8217;re getting into it.  I like that.</p>
<p>  STEWART:  Yes.  </p></blockquote>
<p>*********************<br />
<br />I&#8217;d be curious to hear from anyone who actually watched this whether there was genuine acrimony or whether everyone was laughing.</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.digbysblog.blogspot.com/2004_10_10_digbysblog_archive.html#109787407241970876">Digby saw it</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Stewart is trying to make the point that they are contributing to the dumbing down of the discourse by presenting this fake news, or political theatre, that they pretend is news. He isn&#8217;t being funny and he isn&#8217;t doing the usual celebrity circle jerk and they are finding it very discomfiting. </p></blockquote>
