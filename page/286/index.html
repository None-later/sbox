                                <p>The monthly employment report roughly showed the economy to be still stagnated as the  trends that have been in place so far this year continued. Private payrolls increased modestly by some 67,000 jobs.  But the drop in census temporary employment caused total nonfarm payroll employment to fall 54,000.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TID2hYXdr5I/AAAAAAAABVQ/4i1K6ReleOc/s1600/Clipboard01-EMP.bmp"><br /></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TID2hYXdr5I/AAAAAAAABVQ/4i1K6ReleOc/s1600/Clipboard01-EMP.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TID2hYXdr5I/AAAAAAAABVQ/4i1K6ReleOc/s320/Clipboard01-EMP.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The year over year gain in jobs as reported by both the payroll and the household survey is now near zero.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TID247JXGvI/AAAAAAAABVg/jpiHPBN8rXQ/s1600/Clipboard01emp3.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TID247JXGvI/AAAAAAAABVg/jpiHPBN8rXQ/s320/Clipboard01emp3.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The unemployment rate at 9.6% was essentially unchanged and has remained in a range of<br />9.5% to 9.7% for several months.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TID3ZvBs6XI/AAAAAAAABV4/WNkVTKncP3E/s1600/Clipboard01emp6.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TID3ZvBs6XI/AAAAAAAABV4/WNkVTKncP3E/s320/Clipboard01emp6.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The average workweek was unchanged so hours worked increased 0.3% from 99.2 to 99.5.  On a smoothed basis the three month growth rate of hours worked  slipped to 1.4% versus the recent peak of a 3.7% growth rate in June.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TID9QytH_gI/AAAAAAAABWA/gGwUFZ2KWA8/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TID9QytH_gI/AAAAAAAABWA/gGwUFZ2KWA8/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>Average  hourly earnings growth continued to moderate and average weekly earnings actually ticked down this month.  With energy prices and overall inflation weakening this low level of wage growth is generating some modest gains in real earnings.  As of last month the year over gain in real average hourly earnings of production and non supervisory<br />employees was 0.7% and real weekly wage were up 1.6%. While encouraging, by historical norms this is very weak for the first year of a recovery.</p>

<p>Is going to disagree with Barack Obama and Paul Krugman (alternative title &#8220;which one here is not like the others&#8221;).  Krugman writes and Obama implies that no large stimulus will pass congress.</p>
<p>I think a proposal to send a $500 check to every US citizen containing family would pass congress.  In particular some allegedly Democratic Senators (cough Conrad) are arguing for a temporary extension of Bush tax cuts for the rich.  My proposal dominates Conrads both as effective stimulus and as popular politics.</p>
<p>Update: However, it is not gonna happen </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/116955-white-house-rules-out-sequel-to-stimulus-bill">the top White House spokesman on Thursday said a large spending measure is not being considered. <br /></a><br />&#8220;Some big, new stimulus plan is not in the offing,&#8221; White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said. </p></blockquote>
<p>Note that Sam Youngman at The Hill uses &#8220;spending&#8221; and &#8220;stimulus&#8221; as synonyms, supporting the mistaken belief that the ARRA did not include tax cuts for the vast majority of Americans.  I almost wonder if no one in the White House considered doing it with just tax cuts.  I consider it a no brainer.</p>
<p>update II: this is weird.  A trial balloon in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/02/AR2010090204235_2.html?hpid=topnews&#038;sub=AR&#038;sid=ST2010090204388">the Washington Pos</a>t.  The possible proposal is a payroll tax holiday.  I think that is better policy than an income tax rebate, but it is much worse politics.  People in the USA are angry and want to soak the rich and especially hate hate hate tax cuts for corporations (<a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/budget2.htm">proof at pollingreport.com</a>  search for &#8220;Gallup Poll. April 6-9, 2009. N=1,027 adults nationwide. MoE ± 3.&#8221;).  Somehow the Obama administration is determined that they express their populist rage by electing Republicans.  </p>
<p>They will get no political benefit from the bill.  If it passes people won&#8217;t believe that they cut payroll taxes.  Only a check in the mail will convince many many US voters that some taxes were cut.</p>
<p>Also an anonymous source has decided to basically assert the false claim that the stimulus bill did not include huge tax cuts </p>
<blockquote><p>More spending on infrastructure, particularly transportation projects, is also under discussion. But it would be easier for a package composed purely of tax cuts to &#8220;avoid the stain of a &#8216;bailout&#8217; or &#8216;stimulus&#8217; label,&#8221; said one official familiar with the talks, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were private. </p></blockquote>
<p>Check the quotes.  A Obama administration source linked the words &#8220;stimulus&#8221; and &#8220;bailout&#8221;.  I think that&#8217;s a firing offence.  The line must be &#8220;This time we will propose only tax cuts as, for some reason, many people didn&#8217;t notice the huge tax cuts in the stimulus bill.&#8221; And if the reporter asks for explanation, repeat slowly.</p>
<p>Can anyone there play this game ?<br />My thoughts based on less solid evidence after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Krugman argues that there is no way to get significantly more stimulus out of congress (he began writing this when arguing that the ARRA stimulus was too small).</p>
<p>He writes &#8220;the Republicans will oppose him regardless&#8221; and &#8220;we need another round. <br />I know that getting that round is unlikely: Republicans and conservative Democrats won’t stand for it &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama clearly agrees.  In t<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/08/30/remarks-president-economy">he latest comment on the economy (which I could find) </a>The Whitehouse doesn&#8217;t go far beyond supporting the small business helping bill which Republicans are filibustering in the senate. In particular, the White House almost declared that they are not going to propose another really large stimulus &#8220;Now, no single step is the silver bullet that will reverse the damage&#8221;</p>
<p>I will explain why I think my proposal is political dynamite.  Republicans might oppose it suddenly discovering their concern for the deficit (while arguing for extensions of Bush&#8217;s tax cuts).  I am sure this is political suicide.   Or they can go along and Americans get a nice check in the mail soon before they vote (before the end of October &#8212; I would call it the trick and treat bill).</p>
<p>They and the Washington Post editorial board and similar scolds will denounce it as a transparent attempt to buy votes.  This will publicize the measure.  </p>
<p>I am very dismayed by Obama&#8217;s &#8220;no silver bullet claim.&#8221;  First I think it&#8217;s false as applied to stimulus.  The form of the stimulus matters, but right now the main issue is that it should be large.  Yes money giving money state governments is better than giving money to consumers who might just save it, but congress will give no more money to state governments. </p>
<p>Another key thing is that the bill be simple.  When asked in a poll, only 12% of US adults correctly stated that the Democrats had cut taxes for the vast majority of US families (in ARRA).  12% !!!</p>
<p>Assuming I&#8217;m right (a big assumption) what&#8217;s wrong with Obama ?  I think partly he is too pure to buy votes &#8212; he will propose a stimulus which he thinks is efficient.  Partly he is cautious (which is insane given the polls, when you are behind you have to gamble).  Partly the ghost of Ira Magaziner haunts the White House (this was the guy who loved complexity for its own sake and designed the horrible Clinton Clinton and Magaziner health care reform fiasco).  A simple, simple bill doesn&#8217;t appeal to people who want to show they are smart (I am not thinking of Obama here).</p>
<p>Mostly, I bet they just can&#8217;t stand admitting that Paul Krugman was right.  No one likes doing that, but it is, alas, part of the human condition.</p>

<p>Kevin Drum stresses the very sound point that even if part of current unemployment is structural, we should stimulate to get rid of the part which is cyclical.  I don&#8217;t have a serious disagreement and choose to debate his guess as to the level of structural unemployment for the sake of debating.</p>
<p><a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/09/breaking-down-unemployment">&#8220;The &#8220;normal&#8221; unemployment level is about five points less than it is today. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if perhaps three of those points are cyclical and two are structural.&#8221; </a> </p>
<p>He agrees with Annie Lowrey who <a href="http://washingtonindependent.com/96372/the-cyclical-structural-unemployment-problem">presents the following analysis</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The unemployment is cyclical and structural. Most sectors have suffered from the turndown, but job losses are concentrated in some industries: In residential construction, they are down 38 percent since 2006. (Between Aug. 2007 and Dec. 2009, unemployment in construction quintupled from about 5 percent to about 25 percent.) In health care and education, however, jobs are up.</p></blockquote>
<p>This analysis is accidental theory.  Between the first sentence and the second, there is a theoretical argument that the cycle has the same effect on log employment in each sector.  This argument makes no sense.  More after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I know it is not wise to argue with an &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised&#8221; but their approach to measuring cyclical unemployment is completely incorrect.  Lowrey identifies the cyclical component by assuming  that around the cycle percent changes are equal.  Therefore a much much larger percent change in construction than in health is not cyclical.</p>
<p>In fact, the amplitude of the cycle in log employment is not the same in each sector.  Some sectors are very cyclical (always go down a lot in recessions) others are almost acyclical.  A correct estimate of how much unemployment can be eliminated with fiscal and monetary policy requires an estimate of the effect of fiscal and monetary policy on log-employment by sector.  The assumption that this is necessarily equal is an accidental theory &#8212; a very strong and plainly false assumption which is made by people who think they can just look at the data without theory.</p>
<p>This is the topic of one of my <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedfer/y1997p33-52n1.html">very rare contributions to the actual economics literature</a></p>
<p>The practical relevance of the decomposition is due to the fact that it is argued, that, if unemployment is due to miss-match, then a general stimulus will lead to labor shortages in some sectors.  This would lead to inflation.  As Drum notes this is not a problem at the moment.   However, let&#8217;s imagine a stimulus powerful enough to drive unemployment down to 7%.  Does anyone really think this would create (much more of) a shortage of workers in health care ?  </p>
<p>Why would demand for health care increase much (as a percent of current demand for health care).  85% of people are insured.  Much of the effect of the recession is people moving from private insurance to Medicaid.  There isn&#8217;t a big cycle in the number of uninsured and there is little reason for demand for care by the insured to shift with aggregate demand.  Even the uninsured demand health care in ERs, then go bankrupt.  Recall the HCR debate.  </p>
<p>Now how about residential construction.  Does anyone really think that no construction workers can shift from residential to commercial construction ?  Is there any reason to think that an increase in employment which were to drive the unemployment rate down to 6% would cause labor shortages anywhere ?</p>

<p> American Empire and “exert upon the world the full impact of our influence for such purposes as we see fit and by such means as we see fit” (Henry R. Luce); why the generals push back on Gates’ minimal 3% increase in their war machine, disguised as cuts.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/26/generals-push-back-on-gat_n_696224.html">Generals push back on GAT</a> </p>
<p><strong>Andrew Bacevich on the New American Century:  Empire</strong><br />“Global Leadership:  Empire:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Henry R. Luce made the case for this specious conception of global leadership. Writing in Life magazine in early 1941, the influential publisher exhorted his fellow citizens to “accept wholeheartedly our duty to exert upon the world the full impact of our influence for such purposes as we see fit and by such means as we see fit.” Luce thereby captured what remains even today the credo’s essence.”<br />&#8230;<br />“Along with respectful allusions to God and “the troops,” adherence to Luce’s credo has become a de facto prerequisite for high office.”<br />&#8230;<br />“Note, however, that the duty Luce ascribed to Americans has two components. It is not only up to Americans, he wrote, to choose the purposes for which they would bring their influence to bear, but to choose the means as well.” </p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Militarism to provide the means for empire:</p>
<blockquote><p>“With regard to means, that tradition has emphasized activism over example, hard power over soft, and coercion (often styled “negotiating from a position of strength”) over suasion. Above all, the exercise of global leadership as prescribed by the credo obliges the United States to maintain military capabilities staggeringly in excess of those required for self-defense.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The philosophy that sustains the Military Industrial Complex, top cover for war profits:</p>
<blockquote><p>“By the midpoint of the twentieth century, “the Pentagon” had ceased to be merely a gigantic five-sided building. Like “Wall Street” at the end of the nineteenth century, it had become Leviathan, its actions veiled in secrecy, its reach extending around the world. Yet while the concentration of power in Wall Street had once evoked deep fear and suspicion, Americans by and large saw the concentration of power in the Pentagon as benign. Most found it reassuring.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Numbed population forgets its roots:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A people who had long seen standing armies as a threat to liberty now came to believe that the preservation of liberty required them to lavish resources on the armed forces.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Noble Lie:  Perpetual Mobilization and Militarism, Why have forces to deploy and sustain in remote areas of the world with no threats to the “common defense”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Yet an examination of the past 60 years of U.S. military policy and practice does reveal important elements of continuity. Call them the sacred trinity: an abiding conviction that the minimum essentials of international peace and order require the United States to maintain a global military presence, to configure its forces for global power projection, and to counter existing or anticipated threats by relying on a policy of global interventionism.”<br />&#8230;<br />“Together, credo and trinity &#8212; the one defining purpose, the other practice &#8212; constitute the essence of the way that Washington has attempted to govern and police the American Century.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The US has a sacred duty to squander its treasure and institutions on the Military Industrial Complex for American Empire.  What steps make re-directing this energy and treasure to productive economy possible?</p>

<p>Eric Leeper&#8217;s paper <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2010/2010-08-16-leeper-paper.pdf">Monetary Science, Fiscal Alchemy∗</a>, also found ungated in the <a target="_blank" href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2010/08/31/330826/the-jackson-hole-papers-finally/">Financial Times: Jackson Hole papers finally available</a>, mentioned Angry Bear in a footnote page 12 in the section on reactions to the lastest CBO report.</p>
<p>Here is the fiscal alchemy of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/06/cbo-releases-long-term-budget-outlook.html">Bruce&#8217;s post on the CBO report</a>.  I read it several times and the comments but for the life of me can&#8217;t find any part that suggests fiscal restraint is less severe in the science of monetary, nor ignored the limits of CBO reporting, or suggested the upper and lower bounds were accurate, but did address the public, political statements of impending doom of an election year when insolvency was months away according to the bond vigilantes and several politicos.</p>
<p>Mainly, as Ken suggests in a tweet, &#8220;He believes monetary policy is science, but makes fun of AB?&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand it helps to advertise.</p>

<blockquote><p>:RALEIGH, N.C.—The system that automatically awards disability benefits to some veterans because of concerns about Agent Orange seems contrary to efforts to control federal spending, the Republican co-chairman of President Barack Obama&#8217;s deficit commission said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson&#8217;s comments came a day after The Associated Press reported that diabetes has become the most frequently compensated ailment among Vietnam veterans, even though decades of research has failed to find more than a possible link between the defoliant Agent Orange and diabetes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The irony (is) that the veterans who saved this country are now, in a way, not helping us to save the country in this fiscal mess,&#8221; said Simpson, an Army veteran who was once chairman of the Senate Veterans&#8217; Affairs Committee&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the kind of thing that&#8217;s just driving us to this $1 trillion, $400 billion deficit this year,&#8221; Simpson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m an uncaring person, but common sense is the most uncommon thing in Washington.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Dan (Rdan) here:  We could do the numbers for the whole VA cost, but putting the deficit on the shoulders of diabetic veterans is simply out of it&#8230;when someone becomes old, their real thinking is blurted out without the normal screening public figures often take&#8230;what a tool.</p>
<p>Dan here: Lifted from comments, this wry thought comes to mind regarding Mr. Simpson&#8217;s inner world of lesser people:</p>
<blockquote><p> How would you feel if after forty years of faithful service at five hundred a month and alternate Tuesdays off, your butler or cleaning lady said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve saved up enough to retire, so screw you.&#8221; ?</p></blockquote>

<p>IN this series, i&#8217;ve been discussing the merits of enacting a new series of tax cuts that mimic, at least in part, the Bush temporary tax cut legislation that expires at the end of this year.</p>
<p>The primary arguments for the original Bush temporary tax cuts were either bogus to start with or proven weak over the period of the tax cuts.</p>
<p>1.The Republicans who pushed the cuts claimed first that they were intended to return to taxpayers the surplus. Of course, that argument was laughable from the beginning: Bush deficits started in the first year of the Bush regime and got worse for the long term as the costs of a military budget pumped up by preemptive war and other augmenting of government spending at the same time that tax revenues were cut again and again throughout the regime.</p>
<p>2.Various Republicans also admitted that their goal was to cut the size of government&#8211;though they didn&#8217;t mean the military and they did mean any programs that protect average Americans (such as Social Security, unemployment compensation, environmental programs, OSHA, etc.). But the size of government grew in spite of the reductions in revenue, resulting in expanding deficits.</p>
<p>3.The various expensing provisions; repatriation with almost no taxation (in the 2004 &#8220;American Jobs Creation Act&#8221;); tax breaks for oil and other natural resource companies; international tax breaks; and other corporate-favorable provisions were supposed to stimulate entrepreneurial activity and job creation. Instead, businesses used the low-tax repatriated income to pay managers more and workers less, and laid off workers at the same time. The expensing provisions allowed corporations tax breaks for equipment they would have bought anyway, but didn&#8217;t create new jobs&#8211;the Bush regime&#8217;s jobs record was terrible, barely keeping up with inflation and certainly not spurring new job growth. The tax breaks for natural resource companies fed their complacency about everything from jobs to safety to environmental protection&#8211;giving companies more for less doesn&#8217;t create better citizens and doesn&#8217;t get us cheaper energy either. The record from the tax cuts as far as entrepreneurialism and job creation was dismal&#8211;the mainstream neoconservative and neoliberal theories of market fundamentalism didn&#8217;t work out as claimed.</p>
<p>4.The lowering of capital gains taxation and the taxation of dividend as a net capital gain at the lower rate were also heralded as ways to spur investment in new businesses (entrepreneurialism) and job creation. Bullshit. Most of the result was just more money in the pocket of the richest Americans who own most of the financial assets, and that money in the pocket was as likely to be invested in offshore bank accounts as put to work supporting a new business here in the US. The dividend tax cut didn&#8217;t even lead to much in the way of dividend payouts&#8211;except perhaps for firms whose managers and directors saw a chance to benefit themselves. Even if those expiring tax cuts are not renewed with new tax legislation, it is not likely to have much of an effect on companies&#8217; dividend policies. See <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100830-710392.html" target="_blank">Higher Taxes May Not Push Firms to Cut Dividends</a>, Wall St. J., Aug. 30, 2010.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />5.The cuts in individual rates were supposed to provide more money as an economic stimulus. But the Republicans who passed those rate cuts knew that the AMT would act as a clawback to the cuts over time, except for those at the very top who were always subject to the AMT and those in the bottom who are hardly ever subject to the AMT. And they knew that amending the AMT to conform to the temporary tax cuts would be tremendously expensive&#8211;at least a trillion in revenue lost for the decade of the tax cuts, where the &#8220;temporary&#8221; nature of the bill had been necessary to claim that the cost was &#8220;just&#8221; 1.3 trillion over a decade. In other words, the tax cut bills passed during the Bush regime with the 2010 sunsetting gimmick were a sham from the beginning&#8211;they cost much more than those who passed them wanted to admit, and they carried with them a clawback mechanism that would undo the cuts in rates for many individuals. The various annual &#8220;patches&#8221; to the AMT are extraordinarily costly in terms of lost tax revenues since they are essentially an extension of the tax cuts to an even broader base, and the corporate changes to the AMT have reduced its effectiveness in cutting back on corporate preferences while costing the fisc billions.</p>
<p>6.The estate tax scaleback and one-year repeal was the most gimmicking of all. Cutting the budget by $30 billion a year in order to fund a giveaway to the wealthiest and most privileged Americans is hard to justify in any budgetary climate. So Republicans pushing estate tax repeal and the various &#8220;coalitions&#8221; funded by wealthy families like the Walton heirs have painted a facade of &#8220;helping little guy farmers and businesses&#8221; on their efforts&#8211;a facade that many Americans may have bought hook, line, and sinker since they do not tell the truth, much less the whole story. Very few family farms and very few small businesses are threatened at all by the estate tax.</p>
<p>So what should this list of bogus and failed reasoning tell us about what the Congress should do on taxes for 2011 and thereafter?</p>
<p>1.I say let the Bush cuts expire according to the way they were written. But enact a new set of tax cuts that are better targeted to jumpstart the economy and to put money where it is needed.</p>
<p>2.Let the corporate giveaways expire as slated.</p>
<p>3.Let the estate tax mess expire as slated. Enact a new estate tax law that (i) increases the exemption amount to a reasonable level (say, $2 million) and indexes it for inflation and (ii) enacts a progressive rate structure (ranging from 55% on the estate that exceeds the exemption amount, up to some higher rate of 65% or 70% on multi-billion-dollar estates.</p>
<p>4.Let the capital gains changes die as slated, and do not enact any further capital gains preferences (so dividends would go back to being treated as ordinary income).</p>
<p>5.Let the individual rate changes die as slated, and enact a new tax cut for individuals making $100,000 or less, with a temporary tax cut for individuals making up to $200,000 for a three year period to aid us in getting out of this recession.</p>
<p>6.Enact genuine AMT reform&#8211;in which capital gains are treated as a preference and which provides a significant exemption amount based on gross income. See the earlier articles (2005-2006) in ataxingmatter on AMT reform for more specifics about the kinds of reforms to the AMT that make sense.</p>
<p>7.In conntection with the rate cut and AMT legislation, enact measures to pay for the tax cut, including<br />(i) a carried interest provision taxing all profits interests as ordinary income<br />(ii) a corporate tax provision limiting the benefits of tax-free reorganizations and consolidations, and<br />(iii) a charitable contribution provision eliminating the deduction of value in excess of basis. </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This is the title of a post of a diary at another site, one of no particular interest on its own because it just puts people on the wrong road.</p>
<p>A straight out analysis of the economic numbers underlying Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; shows pretty clearly that there is no &#8216;there&#8217; there. To the extent that there is a gap between future projected income and cost it is small, distant, based on pessimistic assumptions, and totally fixable even if we waited years to take the first step. You can show this on paper or in pixels and I have spent much of the last six years doing that here and there and mostly without numeric push-back, the counter-arguments tending to be thematic and not number based at all.</p>
<p>So why do they push this? Well simple, the Right cannot afford to have a Social Security system that is perceived to be working going forward. They can survive people liking Social Security as is, after all they can spin that as people just enjoying a Free Lunch via that ol&#8217; Backwards Transfer pushed by the nice folk at AEI, that just helps their overall &#8216;mushy headed liberal&#8217; narrative, a modern day Grasshopper and the Ant. What kills them is to find out that the Grasshopper actually has an actuarial sound insurance policy in his back pocket, and one guaranteed by the Federal government, such a realization might lead the rest of the ants to doubt the &#8216;Big Government is not the Solution, Big Government is the Problem&#8217; message being spread by the Ant Queen and her Drones.</p>
<p>In 1993 the anti-Social Security narrative revolved around Trust Fund Depletion, which was a real event which would have real consequences, if not as significant as people would have them (see &#8216;Rosser&#8217;s Equation&#8217; at a Google near you), but by the late 90&#8217;s Trust Fund Depletion had been pushed so far out in time even as the cost to address it steadily dropped that there grew the need for a new crisis narrative. And so &#8216;Phony IOU&#8217; was born. But otherwise nothing much had changed, the definition of &#8216;crisis&#8217; was malleable but the solution was always the same: we needed to Destroy Social Security in Order to Save It.</p>
<p>Typically people on the Left tend to assign three motives for the desire of the Right to &#8216;reform&#8217; Social Security. One is to get their hands on the assets in the Trust Funds. This is a total category mistake, those assets though real as real are not tappable in the way this narrative would require. A second is to get their hands on surpluses going forwards. Well this is the same mistake with a slightly different twist, cash surpluses which were as real as real could be in 1999 are existentially different today. And a third motive advanced was the fees that would be generated on private accounts. Well I don&#8217;t think this pencils out as well as people would think at least for the accounts of people in the lower 50% of income, if it were a pure scheme for extracting account fees they wouldn&#8217;t be pushing for universality, but instead for opt-out for higher-income workers.</p>
<p>Nope in my opinion the fundamental motive for opposing Social Security is not driven by greed as such but instead an ideology that depends crucially on the perception that Big Government is always and everywhere a failure, and that the bigger the counter-example the higher the risk to that overall paradigm. If Social Security was just headed for the cliff, its enemies would just stand back and watch it go, arguably this is where they were at in 1993. It is only when they see the coach driver beginning to get the team under control and steer it away from the cliff that they have to jump in and try to spook the horses again.</p>
<p>Which is why people asking why the actions of Social Security opponents don&#8217;t seem to be particularly helpful in guiding the stage coach away from the cliff are asking the wrong question, looked at in that way their actions don&#8217;t make sense at all. On the other hand if you flip it around a lot of things become clear, there being more than one definition of &#8216;fixing&#8217;.</p>
