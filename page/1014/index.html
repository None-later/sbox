                                <p>It&#8217;s time to check in with this week&#8217;s new data on prices.  This morning the BLS released the October data for the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">consumer price index</a>.  The data showed a small-ish increase in the overall rate of inflation in October, and a very slight rise in the core rate of inflation.</p>
<p>Yesterday the BLS provided its estimate of the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm">producer price index</a> for October, which showed a continued rise in energy prices for producers, but a <em>fall</em> in the prices of non-energy final goods and services that firms buy.  It&#8217;s worth noting that the prices of non-energy intermediate inputs rose at a substantial pace&#8230; but firms that supply final goods and services to other firms were apparently unable to pass those price increases along.</p>
<p>As the chart below illustrates, these reports give us a bit of encouragement that perhaps higher energy prices will not feed through to higher non-energy prices.  At the very least, there are still no signs that happening as of yet; over the past several months, the inflation rate in non-energy items has fallen, not risen.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/cpi_ppi_oct.jpg"></p>
<p>I&#8217;m slowly becoming reassured that the spike in inflation this year due to higher oil prices will indeed prove to be temporary, though it will take another few months of moderate core inflation data to really set my mind at ease on that score.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, this data does nothing to reassure me about my other worry: that the economy may be heading for a noticeable slowdown in the end of 2005 and early 2006.  If anything, the continued weakness in pricing power for non-energy items may provide some slight corroboration for the theory that such <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/slowing-growth.html">a slowdown may already be underway</a>.</p>

<blockquote>WASHINGTON &#8211; Federal health officials didn’t follow normal procedures in rejecting over-the-counter sales of the morning-after pill — and some documents suggest the decision was made even before scientists finished reviewing the evidence, congressional investigators reported Monday.  Politics trumped science, immediately charged long-suspicious members of Congress who had requested the independent audit. “We are deeply opposed to this subversion of science,” Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and 17 other lawmakers wrote Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what would one expect from this White House?  After all, the President lied on Veterans Day and when the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111101832.html">Washington Post</a> called him on this – the White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051113.html">objected</a> with even more lies.</p>

                                <p>Tim Russert opened <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9967566">Meet the Press</a> quoting President Bush:<br />
<blockquote>It is deeply irresponsible to rewrite the history of how that war began.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then Ken Mehlman proceeded to do just that.  <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/006992.php">Josh Marshall</a> notes that Mehlman now has “twice the lying power” and <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2005/11/13.html#a5844">Crooks and Liars</a> provides us with the videotape. </p>
<p>It would seem that <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200511110825.asp">Michael Darda</a> has joined other right wingers claiming that they opposed the 2001 tax cuts:<br />
<blockquote>As an advisor to then-candidate George W. Bush, Larry Lindsey helped design a Keynesian tax cut in 2000, which was passed in 2001 after Bush was elected. It was heavy on consumer rebates and tax credits for the married with children, and light on supply-side incentives for growth. And it was a flop. The 2002 “recovery” moved at the pace of a 40-yard dash in a geriatric ward: Real GDP averaged 1.9 percent annualized growth despite a fed funds rate that was below 2 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, Lindsey was designing his “perfectly timed” tax cut back in 1999 when the economy was at full employment.  Lindsey was also selling himself as a supply-sider back then and most right wingers advocated its passage.  Yes, it flopped despite the National Review’s commentary back in 2002 that it was working wonders.  But then many Keynesians were criticizing its design given that the tax cuts were back loaded and favored high income groups.  </p>
<p>As we read on – we see Darda’s real agenda: praising the 2003 tax cuts.  I’m glad that Darda has seen the light as to the need for more national savings and investment given what he <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200511040835.asp">wrote</a> on November 4 and we <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/on-consumer-demand-and-other-nro.html">criticized</a>: <br />
<blockquote>But there is another thing I don’t get about the free lunch crowd – don’t they understand that as consumption rises relative to income, this means savings declines? Do they teach budget constraints at the economics department of National Review University or have they repealed the law of scarcity?</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Greenspan gave a speech earlier today in which he talked about the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20051114/default.htm">US current account deficit</a>.  Shorter Greenspan:
<ul>
<li>The ability of the US to keep running a huge and growing CA deficit is the result of a decrease in home bias.  In other words, investors around the world are more willing to stash their savings in other countries (e.g. the US) than they used to be, which means that US borrowers have easier access to foreign loans than they used to.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s not much that policy-makers can do about it.  Interest rate and exchange rate management would have limited effects, as would deficit-reduction efforts.</li>
<li>The US CA deficit can&#8217;t keep growing forever.  Sooner or later it&#8217;s going to stop growing, and interest rates in the US will rise.</li>
<li>However, the adjustment can probably still be smooth for the US, due to &#8220;the flexibility of our market-driven economy.&#8221;  So there&#8217;s no need to worry, unless policy-makers start mucking about with the natural workings of the market.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are familiar themes from earlier comments by Greenspan about the CA deficit.  I was most disappointed about this line in his speech, however: &#8220;a discretionary reduction in our federal budget deficit would work toward narrowing the current account deficit but, if history is any judge, to an uncertain and possibly small extent.&#8221;</p>
<p>This downplaying of the importance of reducing the budget deficit strikes me as almost irresponsible from a central banker.  The speech was a perfect chance for Greenspan to talk about the dangers inherent in the large and sustained structural budget deficit in the US.  While it is true that reducing the budget deficit would cause only a &#8220;possibly small&#8221; improvement in the US CA imbalance, it is also true that the effect could be possibly quite large (econometric studies disagree substantially about that point).  Regardless, any central banker of a country with the terrible budget problems of the US has a responsibility to clearly point out that budget problems and CA problems are often closely related, and that anything that can be done to alleviate the US&#8217;s CA problem will help to make the coming adjustment less painful.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the speech contained nothing striking.  Perhaps this speech contained a slightly more direct statement of the obvious, which is that the US CA deficit must start falling at some point.  But he was typically sanguine about that prospect.  Of course, like the rest of us, Greenspan has no idea when or how things will really transpire&#8230;</p>

                                <p>In The Economist, Buttonwood <a href="http://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5132938">asks</a>: &#8220;The air is coming out of America’s property-price bubble. Will it pop or go quietly?&#8221;.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Mortgage applications were down by about 5% in October compared with September, and were lower than the same month a year earlier. The stock of unsold new houses is rising. The only bullish sign is that homeowners continue to take equity out of their homes at a healthy clip: in the third quarter, they withdrew more than $60 billion, on figures from Freddie Mac—about the same as the previous three-month period.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  The level of mortgage equity extraction appears ominous to me, and Buttonwood agrees:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230; even [if housing prices] just &#8230; rise less quickly &#8230; that would be bad news for the economy. Consumer spending accounts for 70% of growth these days, so closing down even part way the home-equity cash machine that has fed consumption would put the economic brakes on sharpish.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  But will the slowdown lead to a soft or hard landing?  Buttonwood considers the possibilities of rising financial distress:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;What could give this scenario an uglier twist is the sharp increase in funny loans to funny borrowers over the past few years. &#8216;Subprime lending&#8217; to people who would not normally be able to make the grade is running at about $500 billion a year. Much of it takes the form of variable-rate, interest-only and negative-amortisation loans. Both debtors and creditors are now more exposed to interest-rate changes.<br />&#8230;<br />So it all comes back to interest rates, and to how determined the central bank is to keep raising them until house prices retreat. &#8230; the housing market reacts to monetary tightening after a lag of one to two years, it seems, so the temptation will be to overshoot. In which case the Fedsters will bring down house prices and the economy itself not with a whimper but a bang.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  I think we can put Buttonwood in the hard landing camp.  </p>
<p>And a couple of mentions:  Dr. Duy believes (FED Watch: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/11/fed_watch_heade.html">Headed for More of the Same</a>) that the FED will keep raising rates until they see clear signs of economic weakness:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;If I am reading all this correctly, the Fed will not react until it sees significant stress on the consumer (assuming that is the correct channel of transmission) – again, in the data, not anecdotally. Note that such a point could still be months away:  A housing slowdown will need to become evident, then spread into consumption, and then show up in the data.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  That sounds like Buttonwood&#8217;s possible &#8220;overshoot&#8221; scenario.</p>

                                <p>When I <a href="http://%20angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/gasoline-market-and-government-policy.html">endorsed</a> taxing some of the economic rent earned by owners of oil fields, <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/11/market_power_su.html">David Altig</a> took notice and our <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/oil-windfall-profits-tax-and-ceteris.html">debate</a> <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/11/windfall_profit.html">continued</a>: <br />
<blockquote>It was certainly not my intention to associate pgl with either price controls or &#8220;the tax gouging spinmeisters,&#8221; which I probably did by combining commentary on the tax issue with commentary related to critics who accuse the oil companies of price gouging … I take pgl&#8217;s comment to be that, as long as we are searching about for ways to close the fiscal financing gap, why not take the opportunity to collect some revenue via the windfall profit tax?</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you David – that is my position.  David’s main position is that the type of tax we had during the early 1980’s will not likely raise much revenue for an extended period:<br />
<blockquote>Things change, and profits and prices in the energy sector are notoriously volatile. To my mind, this fact significantly diminishes the attractiveness of a windfall profit tax as a way to finance government expenditures. </p></blockquote>
<p>In a way, he might be right as one can see viewing <a href="http://www.inflationdata.com/inflation/Inflation_Rate/Historical_Oil_Prices_Chart.asp">this chart</a> if we decide to set the same level in real terms before the tax kicks in.  The nominal level may have been only $30 a barrel during the early 1980’s but remember that the price-level has doubled since then.  If current proposals are to impose a tax for prices above $60 a barrel, we will not collect much in revenues.  But if we set this level at $40 a barrel, I suspect the strong oil demand will continue to keep prices above this level.  </p>
<p>Some liberals might ask – why $40 and not $30 or $20.  Does David have a point with:<br />
<blockquote>A windfall profit tax is essentially an after-the-fact tax on fixed capital.  As such, it is prime candidate for the time inconsistency critique. In brief, because &#8220;windfall profits&#8221; represent returns on economic activity that has already taken place, it may seem like a free lunch to generate revenue from these profits because there is not a whole lot that the taxed companies can do to to avoid paying the tax today.  But if the impacted businesses anticipate that the tax will persist or be levied again in comparable future circumstances &#8211; and why wouldn&#8217;t they? &#8211; the end result will be a less than socially optimal level of investment.</p></blockquote>
<p>David seems to be making the same argument that this <a href="http://www.pantagraph.com/stories/102505/opi_20051025001.shtml">critique</a> of the Durbin proposal makes:<br />
<blockquote>A proposal from Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., that he maintains would generate an estimated $40 billion is simply a windfall for the federal bureaucracy, not a boon for cash-strapped consumers. Durbin&#8217;s idea is just one of several floating around Washington. Under his plan, oil companies would have to pay a 50 percent tax on profits made when oil prices are above $40 a barrel … But crude oil prices aren&#8217;t driven solely by oil companies, as Durbin wants people to believe. The price of a barrel of oil is determined by a number of factors, including the familiar law of supply and demand. It&#8217;s a worldwide market. Demand is increasing from places such as China that are becoming more heavily industrialized. The supply is still heavily controlled by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The United States could have an impact by decreasing its demand &#8211; through use of more fuel-efficient vehicles, for example &#8211; and increasing its supplies. The higher oil prices could make it financially feasible for oil companies to put more revenue into exploration or into oil that is more costly to recover. A lot of small operations have resumed pumping from oil wells on farm fields in many parts of Illinois now that higher prices cover their costs. A &#8220;windfall&#8221; profits tax would do more harm than good. </p></blockquote>
<p>Have they read the Durbin proposal – especially in light of this <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w051107&#038;s=risen111005">defense</a>: <br />
<blockquote>But as Dorgan explained at a press conference announcing the bill, &#8220;this is not your father&#8217;s windfall profits tax.&#8221; Instead, the Dodd-Dorgan plan offers companies an out: Profits invested in oil exploration, refineries, or capacity expansion would be exempt from the tax. &#8220;It will be the most significant incentive for them to use those profits to invest in the ground of any incentive I can possibly think of.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Even <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/wew/articles/05/profits.html">Walter Williams</a> understands the point of taxing economic rent:<br />
<blockquote>Windfall or supernormal profits are any profits in excess of normal profit and are above and beyond that necessary to keep entrepreneurial resources in their current usage. However, windfall profits are a vital component to a smoothly operating economy. Windfall profits serve as a signal that there are unmet human wants.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, Williams is against price controls, but so am I.  Furthermore, liberals like <a href="http://www.kucinich.us/archive/report/display.php?r=39&#038;d=2005-08-17+10%3A06%3A14">Dennis Kucinich</a> are also confusing the issue:<br />
<blockquote>There is a short term, effective solution: The Gas Price Spike Act of 2005. This bill exacts a 100% windfall profits tax on oil companies on excessive profits … Only a 100% windfall profits tax will cause the oil companies to stop their aggressive pricing which is destroying the budgets of millions of American families.</p></blockquote>
<p>No – I am not supporting a tax on economic rent because of some insane view that taxes lower prices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/11/windfall_profit_1.html">David Altig</a> replies by noting that some Democrats wish to tax oil companies to subsidize consumers of energy.  In the old days, we used to subsidize growers of tobacco only to tax consumers.  This exercise struck me as very odd.  David seems to think the current proposal by some Democrats to tax suppliers only to subsidize consumers is also very odd.  I agree!</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Thanks to everyone for the great comments on my (albeit reluctantly offered) “<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/few-notes-on-trade.html">Notes on Trade</a>” post.  I thought I should take the time to try to answer some questions and address some concerns that came up.  My response ran too long to be practically included in the comments, so I thought I’d put them up as a new post.  </p>
<p>Here is a partial list of some of the good points made by commenters, along with my reactions, in no particular order (sorry if I missed your point or question; it was hard addressing 60+ comments in a reasonable space):
<ul>
<li>Through no fault of their own, a few people were fooled by my choice of scale on the graph that I provided, which seemed to indicate that median income has been rising less quickly than the increase in US import penetration in recent years.  Since the two measures are fundamentally different (different units, different scales), that graphical suggestion was simply an artifact of the range that I selected for the graph; if I had chosen to make the left-hand axis cover the range from 5%-20% of GDP instead of 7% to 15%, it would have looked like real income has grown more quickly in recent years than import penetration.</p>
</li>
<li>A few people also noted that the graph was not convincing evidence that trade leads to higher income, because causality is unclear, perhaps trade or income are measured incorrectly, and there are lots of other things affecting both trade and income.  These points are all quite true, which is why I said that the graph proves nothing.  The graph was simply intended to illustrate that it’s certainly not obvious that more imports have reduced the welfare of the median American family.  In fact, the <em>prima facie</em> evidence probably puts the burden of proof on those who think that trade lowers median income.
<p>To really discern the relationship is a very tricky econometric problem – but one that careful economists have made some pretty good attempts at solving.  Those sophisticated econometric studies are what I was referring to when I said that the empirical evidence suggests that trade raises income. (If I have time in the next couple of days I&#8217;ll try to provide a reading list of such studies, for those masochists among you&#8230;)  My chart, however, was no attempt to provide such evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>A few people also accepted my suggestion that the benefits from trade is ultimately an empirical question, and followed up by arguing that this means that the benefits from trade should be examined on a case-by-case basis.  I would just like to note that this is extremely difficult – perhaps impossible – to do.
<p>In a narrow sense, every international transaction is of course beneficial for both sides of the deal, otherwise the parties involved wouldn’t agree to the deal in the first place.  But to determine how any particular import or export will affect the broader economy, one would need to be able to trace the effects of one individual transaction (say, one US company shifting its sourcing of T-shirts from a factory in North Carolina to a factory in Sri Lanka) on the entire economy – something that is probably impossible to do, since the US economy is so huge and each particular transaction is so tiny.  And if you&#8217;re going to do that, why not examine the economy-wide impact of <em>every</em> particular business deal, not just those that happen to cross a political border?  </p>
</li>
<li>Several people mentioned that the trade imbalance may be a significant source of worry, even if trade by itself is not a bad thing.  This is true; however, this is really a separate issue.  If the US imported less, the trade imbalance would be exactly the same as it is, because the US would also export less.  If we could magically cut our imports by $500 billion overnight, we would find that our exports also fall by $500 billion.  That’s because the trade imbalance is due to a fundamental imbalance between what Americans produce and what they consume, or, put another way, how much Americans save compared to how much people in other countries save.  Until US savings rise, the trade imbalance will remain, no matter how high or low imports are.  (Note that this is not an economic theory; this is an accounting identity, and is as true as the fact that night follows day.)
</li>
<li>There are losers from trade, and I think it&#8217;s lousy when bad things like that happen to people through no fault of their own.  As I mentioned before, many American economists (such as yours truly) are probably losers from trade, as well as some of the people commenting on the post.  Unfortunately, there are losers from just about every economic transaction that one can think of, and lots of losers from things like new technology.  But it is unclear to me why we should do things to only help the losers from trade, and ignore the losers from new inventions, or industry change, or anything else.  That doesn’t make any sense to me.  That’s why I advocate things like wage insurance, and a stronger social safety net… things that are not specific to people who lose out from trade.   Furthermore, if we try to help the losers from trade by limiting trade, then we will just create new economic losers, in industries that depended on the imports.  Why is one set of people more deserving of help than another?
</li>
<li>What’s the difference between trade and new technology?  Both increase productivity, not just in the exporting country, but in the importing country, as well, since the importing country can now produce more stuff with a smaller expenditure of resources.
<p>But some commenters referred to Bivens’ argument that technology may help low-skilled workers or high-skilled workers, but trade always hurts low-skill workers.  This may be true, though I’d need to see some evidence before I accept such an assertion.   (It’s hard for me to think of any technological changes that have helped low-skill workers in the past half-century, at least.)  But even if it is tue, that to me makes the case for providing more help to the least-skilled among us, not a case for limiting trade.  </p>
<p>In addition, Bivens notes that the prices of consumer goods have risen more quickly than the prices of all other goods, which suggests that workers have lost out from trade.  But while he’s right that there is a difference in price increases between consumer goods and all other goods, that difference is due entirely to the fact that the price of IT equipment has fallen so dramatically in price since the 1970s.  Firms buy lots more IT equipment than consumers, so it looks like prices for firms have risen more slowly than prices for individuals.  In other words, the reason for that gap is technological change, not trade. </li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, let me address a deeper question: if it’s not trade, what then accounts for the stagnation in incomes among the less educated in the US over the past 25 years?  Or, put another way, why has the balance of power between workers and large corporations seemed to shift?  </p>
<p>The biggest force behind this phenomenon that the best econometric studies have identified is technological change that benefits more-skilled workers at the expense of less-skilled workers (e.g. computers that replace poorly-educated workers but create new jobs for those who build, design, and run them).  Personally, I think that there’s also been an increase in corporate power because anti-trust regulation has steadily diminished over the past two decades, leaving firms subject to less competition and with more individual power. </p>
<p>If that’s true, what do we do about the plight of the lower-income, less-educated workers in the US?  My answers would be: more public resources spent on educating those at the bottom of the economic ladder; more income redistribution more generally; a stronger social safety net to help those who have the bad luck to be on the wrong side of international trade <em>or</em> technological progress – a safety net that should include wage insurance (more about that later this week) as well as national health insurance; and a new vigor from the government in promoting competition and limiting the power of individual corporations.</p>
<p>Do these things, and then I’ll be happy.  Fail to do these things, and there will continue to be people who suffer needlessly from the constant process of economic change, trade or no trade.  </p>

                                <p>The Washington Post is not a perfect newspaper.  Along with most major newspapers in this country, it has been guilty of uncritically reporting the administration&#8217;s garbage many times over the past 5 years, particularly when it comes to the administration&#8217;s fiscal train wreck.  But increasingly, the Post is willing to examine the administration&#8217;s statements for accuracy, while the Times is not.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s paper provides a perfect example.  The NYTimes ran <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/12/politics/12bush.html">one story</a> on its front page about Bush&#8217;s speech yesterday:<br />
<blockquote>In his speech, Mr. Bush asserted that Democrats as well as Republicans believed before the invasion in 2003 that Saddam Hussein possessed banned weapons, a conclusion, he said, that was shared by the United Nations. He resisted any implication that his administration had deliberately distorted the available intelligence, and said that the resolution authorizing the use of force had been supported by more than 100 Democrats in the House and Senate based on the same information available to the White House.</p>
<p>&#8230;Two official inquiries &#8211; by the Senate Intelligence Committee and by a presidential commission &#8211; blamed intelligence agencies for inflating the threat posed by Iraq&#8217;s weapons programs, but stopped short of ascribing the problems to political pressures.</p></blockquote>
<p>No mention of the fact that many of Bush&#8217;s statements yesterday were demonstrably questionable.  One would think that the President saying things that are untrue would be news, too, but the NYTimes simply reports what he says and leaves it at that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Washington Post ran one story reporting the contents of Bush&#8217;s speech, and then <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111101832.html">another front page story</a> that contained the following starting paragraphs:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Asterisks Dot White House&#8217;s Iraq Argument</strong></p>
<p>President Bush and his national security adviser have answered critics of the Iraq war in recent days with a two-pronged argument: that Congress saw the same intelligence the administration did before the war, and that independent commissions have determined that the administration did not misrepresent the intelligence.</p>
<p>Neither assertion is wholly accurate.</p>
<p>The administration&#8217;s overarching point is true: Intelligence agencies overwhelmingly believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and very few members of Congress from either party were skeptical about this belief before the war began in 2003. Indeed, top lawmakers in both parties were emphatic and certain in their public statements.</p>
<p>But Bush and his aides had access to much more voluminous intelligence information than did lawmakers, who were dependent on the administration to provide the material. And the commissions cited by officials, though concluding that the administration did not pressure intelligence analysts to change their conclusions, were not authorized to determine whether the administration exaggerated or distorted those conclusions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unlike the NYTimes (which I&#8217;ve almost stopped reading, I must confess), the Post deserves credit for daring to show some evidence that they know how to think and write critically.  If only they had done so years ago&#8230;</p>

                                <p><a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/11/market_power_su.html">David Altig</a> cites the <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/1168.html">Tax Foundation</a> for “evidence” that a windfall profits tax will gather little additional revenue.  David writes:<br />
<blockquote>The shortfall from projected revenues in that picture had a lot to do with missed projections on energy prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>But did the tax on U.S. providers of oil cause Russian and OPEC to start supplying more oil?  Spencer in a couple of good comments fires back at the CBO study, which showed the difference between projected revenues and actual revenues:<br />
<blockquote>Technically, the windfall profits tax was signed into law in April 1980 and remained on the books until 1988. But the tax only collected revenues when the price of crude was above $30 and April 1983 was the last month oil was above $30. So for all practical purposes the effective end of the tax was April 1983 &#8211; because no one had to pay the tax after that point.</p></blockquote>
<p>Williams and Hodge of the Tax Foundation make the following claim:<br />
<blockquote>The answer to the second question, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), is that the 1980s windfall profits tax depressed the domestic production and extraction industry and furthered our dependence on foreign sources of oil … CRS also found the windfall profits tax had the effect of decreasing domestic production by 3 percent to 6 percent</p></blockquote>
<p>Spencer has challenged their claim but even if it is true, a 3% reduction in domestic quantity supplied is not the primary cause of the forecast error.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, I hope I was <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/gasoline-market-and-government-policy.html">clear</a> that I’m opposed to price controls and do not buy into this price gouging spin.  Spencer does not buy into the spin either.  I’m not sure why David associated my advocacy for a gasoline tax with the gouging spinmeisters.</p>

                                <p>You may have noticed (or you may not) that I have remained conspicuously silent on the excellent debate currently going on in the liberal blog world these days regarding the costs and benefits of international trade.  It all started at the <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/">TPMCafe</a> with a debate amongst Gene Sperling, Alan Blinder, and David Sirota, among others, with side commentary contributed by <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_11_06_atrios_archive.html#113159884896940365">Atrios</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_11/007534.php">Kevin Drum</a>, and <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001753.html">Josh Bivens</a>, not to mention a nicely applied quote by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/alan-blinder-v-josh-bivens-on-free.html">PGL</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for my silence is simply this: I&#8217;ve tried writing about this subject in the past, but the degree to which people on both sides seem to be unwilling to listen to each other and actually have a constructive argument, and instead simply throw around unsupported assertions, empty catch phrases, and <em>ad hominem</em> attacks just makes my head hurt.  </p>
<p>So I&#8217;m going to keep my remarks on this subject strictly limited.  Or at least, far more limited than they could be, given that I&#8217;ve spent a sizeable fraction of my life studying this subject.  So I&#8217;m not going to try to argue in favor of free trade today.  (If you want to hear some of the arguments I&#8217;ve put forward in the past, see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003/11/trade-with-china-as-technological.html">here</a> or <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003/11/trade-and-income-growth-some-data-id.html">here</a>.)  </p>
<p>Instead, let me just try to clear up a couple of misconceptions, with the goal of pushing the debate slightly away from idle speculation and closer to the issues that have actual relevance.  Please consider the following attempts on my behalf to clarify a number of apparent points of confusion:
<ol>
<li>First, let me echo posts on <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_11_06_atrios_archive.html#113159884896940365">Eschaton</a> and <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001753.html">MaxSpeak</a>, which point out that indeed, there are winners and losers from trade, and that the losers are&#8230; well, losers.  ALL ECONOMISTS discussing free trade readily acknowledge this.  In fact, all economists learn about this theoretical reality, known as the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, in their very first course in international trade, and rehash it in every other course about trade that they ever take or teach during the course of their career.</p>
</li>
<li>Despite its theoretically interesting result, let me suggest that the Stopler-Samuelson theorem doesn&#8217;t really tell us anything about how harmful trade is.  The only thing that S-S tells us is that gauging the benefit or harm from trade is an empirical question.  There could be 1 loser from trade and 300 million winners, or the other way around; S-S simply provides us no good insight. (Okay, that&#8217;s a <em>slight</em> exaggeration, but only a slight one.)  So in the end we have to look at the empirical evidence.  That&#8217;s what the entire debate is about in economics regarding trade: it&#8217;s not about whether there are winners and losers, it&#8217;s about how large the negative effects are and who they fall on, and how large the positive effects are and who reaps them.
</li>
<li>Just as S-S provides a solid (but pretty useless) theoretical result that there are winners and losers from trade, we also have lots of solid theoretical results that show that if you add up the dollars lost by the losers as a result of trade, they would be less than the dollars gained by the winners.  Again, that is a somewhat useless theoretical result, because any economist worth more than their weight in cow manure really cares about a lot more than just the numbers of dollars earned in the economy, as <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_11_06_atrios_archive.html#113163836994543773">Atrios also correctly points out</a>.
</li>
<li>Trade <strong><em>does</em></strong> increase productivity just as surely as technological progress does, and has exactly the same effects.    An improvement in productivity means that a worker (or more generally, the economy) can produce the same amount of output using fewer resources.  Better technology does that.  And <em>so does international trade</em>.  To continue with AB&#8217;s example: Just as tax software makes one accounting firm able to do many more tax returns in a given period of time, thus making each tax return cheaper, farming out tax returns to Indian accountants makes each accounting firm able to do many more tax returns in a given period of time, thus making each tax return cheaper.  Trade is just another way to allow the economy to produce more using fewer resources.  It is no different from technological progress. (See the UPDATE at the bottom of this post for more on this subject.)
</li>
<li>Trade, and the threat of competition from foreign workers, may indeed alter the balance of power between workers and firms.  And that may be a legitimate source of concern.  But if one follows that line of reasoning, one must also acknowledge that trade, and the threat of competition from foreign firms, may indeed alter the balance of power between firms and consumers.  Note that consumers and workers are the same people.
</li>
<li>Economists who generally think international trade is a good idea are not idiots, idealogues, or evil blood-sucking vampires who want to drain the life out of individuals and give it to corporations.  Most of them are people like me, who (as I hope you believe after reading my writing on this blog over the past 2 years) <strong><em>genuinely care about the welfare of individuals</em></strong>.  In addition, economists are in general a group of very smart people (most much smarter than me), who have spent years &#8211; YEARS &#8211; studying this subject to come to the conclusions that they&#8217;ve reached.  So please don&#8217;t dismiss Gene Sperling, Alan Blinder, Paul Krugman, or me, as brain-washed, dumb, heartless jerks just because we think trade generally is a good thing.  (Okay, so maybe I was just gratuitously seizing the chance to include myself in the same sentence with those three&#8230; but can you blame me?)
</li>
<li>Please understand that the vast majority of economists are not in favor of international trade simply because we have the luxury of being insulated from it.  The market for professional economists is probably far more internationally integrated than most markets; we face enormous competition from foreign economists on both the teaching and research side.  I can assert with confidence that if there was no international trade in economic research and teaching, my salary would be far, far higher than it is.  But while it has harmed me personally, I still think the competition is a good thing for the country.</li>
</ol>
<p>So now to the real question: Why do economists like me, who profess to care about individuals, continue to think international trade is generally a good thing?  (Yes, I know I said I wasn&#8217;t going to get into this&#8230; but let me make just one point&#8230;)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the reason: The negative or positive impact of trade is ultimately an empirical question (see point #2 above), and the evidence I&#8217;ve seen in my years of researching this subject suggests that the negative effects are outweighed by the positive.  Actually, to be more precise, the evidence I&#8217;ve seen mostly suggests that the effects of trade are pretty small in a country like the US.  Some people win from trade, and some lose from trade (just as is the case with any new technology)&#8230; but overall, though the effects are small, trade seems to make life better for most people.  Not just for corporations: for <em><strong>people</strong></em>.</p>
<p>As an example, let me just include one graph.  This chart shows one measure of the relative importance of trade in the US economy: imports (excluding oil) as a % of GDP.  Since the biggest fear about trade is that it depresses wages for workers and enriches capitalists, I&#8217;ve plotted real <strong><em>median</em></strong> household income against this measure of imports.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/trade_and_income.JPG"><br />Source: Median income figures from <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/income.html">Census</a>.  Since Census data only shows take-home pay, I&#8217;ve added benefits to this series by using the BEA&#8217;s data on personal income to estimate the total non-wage benefits received by workers as a % of income.</p>
<p>Obviously, there&#8217;s a strong correlation between these two variables: more imports are associated with higher household income.  But this graph does <strong>not</strong> prove that trade causes higher income.  In fact, it doesn&#8217;t really prove anything at all.  </p>
<p>However, it does strongly suggest that if trade has a negative impact on median earnings, that impact is very small.  More likely, trade may actually have a positive impact on the median household &#8211; and that&#8217;s what careful econometric research generally shows, and that&#8217;s why I think trade is generally beneficial.  </p>
<p>I could go on, but I&#8217;ll stop here.  Please try to keep these points in mind as you think about and debate this issue.  And please try to respect people who have different opinions from you about this issue.</p>
<p>Okay, now that I&#8217;ve made these points, let the debate rage on.  </p>
