<p>The 1920s Depression: Glenn Beck, Thomas Woods, and &#8220;Benefits&#8221; of Cutting Taxes to Combat a Recession, Part 1</p>
<p>So I get an e-mail from reader Dean Moriarty, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday, I found myself in the sad position of inadvertantly listening to the Glenn Beck show. He was talking to some caller about how American history classes never want to talk about the 1920 Depression, because it is a matter that somehow completely undermines everything we are taught about how &#8220;the New Deal was a miracle and totally saved America from the Great Depression.&#8221; Aside from the straw man he made about the New Deal, I was still curious why he felt that the government response to the 1920 Depression was such a trenchant rebuttal of any kind of left-leaning economic philosophy. </p>
<p>Basically, the claim is made that it was a cut in government spending, tax cuts, laissez-faire ecomomic policy, and inaction on the Federal Reserve that solved the problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean goes on to point out that Beck claims to get many of these ideas from a dude called <a href="http://mises.org/fellow.aspx?Id=23">Thomas Woods</a>, who is a senior fellow with the very libertarian Mises Institute. The guy has written a few books and gotten a few awards from assorted libertarian organizations, so he&#8217;s something of a prominent chap int those circles. </p>
<p>Woods&#8217; position on the 1920s can be found <a href="http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=1322&#038;theme=home&#038;loc=b">here</a>. Its even got footnotes so you just know its authoritative. Anyway, read the whole thing if you&#8217;d like, but what Woods is arguing is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the endlessly repeated conventional wisdom, the Great Depression of the 1930s was the result of capitalism run riot, and only the wise interventions of progressive politicians restored prosperity. Many of those who concede that the New Deal programs alone did not succeed in lifting the country out of depression nevertheless go on to suggest that the massive government spending during World War II is what did it.1 (Even some nominal free-marketeers make the latter claim, which hands the entire theoretical argument to supporters of fiscal stimulus.) <br />The connection between this version of history and the events of today is obvious enough: once again, it is claimed, wildcat capitalism has created a terrific mess, and once again, only a combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus can save us.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In order to make sure that this version of events sticks, little, if any, public mention is ever made of the depression of 1920–21. And no wonder: that historical experience deflates the ambitions of those who promise us political solutions to the real imbalances at the heart of economic busts. The conventional wisdom holds that in the absence of government countercyclical policy, whether fiscal or monetary (or both), we cannot expect economic recovery—at least, not without an intolerably long delay. Yet the very opposite policies were followed during the depression of 1920–21, and recovery was in fact not long in coming.</p>
<p>The economic situation in 1920 was grim. By that year unemployment had jumped from 4 percent to nearly 12 percent, and GNP declined 17 percent. No wonder, then, that Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover—falsely characterized as a supporter of laissez-faire economics—urged President Harding to consider an array of interventions to turn the economy around. Hoover was ignored.</p>
<p>Instead of “fiscal stimulus,” Harding cut the government’s budget nearly in half between 1920 and 1922. The rest of Harding’s approach was equally laissez-faire. Tax rates were slashed for all income groups. The national debt was reduced by one-third. The Federal Reserve’s activity, moreover, was hardly noticeable. As one economic historian puts it, “Despite the severity of the contraction, the Fed did not move to use its powers to turn the money supply around and fight the contraction.” 2 By the late summer of 1921, signs of recovery were already visible. The following year, unemployment was back down to 6.7 percent and was only 2.4 percent by 1923.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article goes on providing support for the idea that a) the gubmint stayed the heck out of the economy and b) the economy recovered swimmingly. It ends with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The experience of 1920–21 reinforces the contention of genuine free-market economists that government intervention is a hindrance to economic recovery. It is not in spite of the absence of fiscal and monetary stimulus that the economy recovered from the 1920–21 depression. It is because those things were avoided that recovery came. The next time we are solemnly warned to recall the lessons of history lest our economy deteriorate still further, we ought to refer to this episode—and observe how hastily our interrogators try to change the subject.</p></blockquote>
<p>I read this, and to me its poison &#8211; it sounds reasonable, but is off just enough to be completely misleading. And it seems to me to be more than just purposely deceitful. See, influential people, whether they also think its deceitful or not, use these arguments. And that makes them dangerous. To me, dealing with this sort of thing is unpleasant. And I&#8217;m wasting my Sunday on something unpleasant only because I think its important. So before I lay into this let me explain the result of this post. I am going to lay out some arguments. They will state that Woods is wrong. My statements will contradict his in such a way that the difference between us will not be one of opinion. It will be one of facts and the use of facts. And I believe that at the end, there will be only four options. These are:<br />1. I am making up substantially all of my facts in a willfully deceitful way&#8230; and one would have to be crazy to take me seriously on anything<br />2. I am mistaken to the point of being delusional&#8230; and one would have to be crazy to take me seriously on anything<br />3. Woods is making up substantially all of his facts in a willfully deceitful way&#8230; and one would have to be crazy to take him seriously on anything<br />4. Woods is mistaken to the point of being delusional&#8230; and one would have to be crazy to take him seriously on anything</p>
<p>So with that, I&#8217;m going to start with what what normally might be a big deal, but in this case amounts to a minor quibble. And that quibble is that Woods uses made up data and doesn&#8217;t let on that the data he&#8217;s using is not the real thing. This may not be data he made up, mind you, and it may go by but its made up nevertheless. </p>
<p>For example, when Woods tells you that &#8220;unemployment had jumped from 4 percent to nearly 12 percent&#8221; in 1920 (presumably he means the unemployment rate) or that the &#8221; unemployment was back down to 6.7 percent and was only 2.4 percent by 1923&#8243; Woods is using somebody&#8217;s estimate of the unemployment rate. But if you head on over the Bureau of Labor Statistics&#8217; website, and look around for historical figures, they&#8217;ll give you data going back to <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/lf/aat1.txt">1940 and no further</a>. Spend a bit more time on the BLS site poking around and you might find an FAQ entitled <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm">&#8220;How the Government Measures Unemployment&#8221;</a> which states:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Because unemployment insurance records relate only to persons who have applied for such benefits, and since it is impractical to actually count every unemployed person each month, the Government conducts a monthly sample survey called the Current Population Survey (CPS) to measure the extent of unemployment in the country. The CPS has been conducted in the United States every month since 1940, when it began as a Work Projects Administration project.</p></blockquote>
<p>We can get into a quibble about the establishment survey and its precursors, but suffice it to say, whatever data Woods is using is an estimate someone probably produced long, long after the fact. Similarly, Woods tells us in 1920 &#8220;GNP declined 17 percent.&#8221; And once again, the question is, where is this data supposed to come from? Because when someone says &#8220;GNP&#8221; the natural assumption by someone with some familiarity with the data is that it originates with the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; National Income and Product Account Tables. And <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N#S1">those tables</a> only go back to 1929. Simon Kuznets wasn&#8217;t producing estimates before that. </p>
<p>Where does his data come from? No idea. Maybe he got it from Glenn Beck for all I know. But I have a hard time taking estimates produced decades after the fact seriously if I don&#8217;t know how it was done or by who. And when the person using those figures either doesn&#8217;t know or doesn&#8217;t tell you who made the data he&#8217;s using or how, it really gets suspect. But like I said earlier, for where we&#8217;re going, this is just a quibble. </p>
<p>So let&#8217;s quit the quibbles and get into his argument, namely that our Hero, Warren G. Harding, went all slash-and-burn on them vile tax rates starting in 1920, the Federal Reserve did nothing, and this led to a robust recovery, unlike, say, what tax hikes and gubmint meddling did to the Great Depression. Here&#8217;s how he puts it:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Not surprisingly, many modern economists who have studied the depression of 1920–21 have been unable to explain how the recovery could have been so swift and sweeping even though the federal government and the Federal Reserve refrained from employing any of the macroeconomic tools—public works spending, government deficits, inflationary monetary policy—that conventional wisdom now recommends as the solution to economic slowdowns. The Keynesian economist Robert A. Gordon admitted that “government policy to moderate the depression and speed recovery was minimal. The Federal Reserve authorities were largely passive. . . . Despite the absence of a stimulative government policy, however, recovery was not long delayed.”5 Another economic historian briskly conceded that “the economy rebounded quickly from the 1920–21 depression and entered a period of quite vigorous growth” but chose not to comment further on this development.6 “This was 1921,” writes the condescending Kenneth Weiher, “long before the concept of countercyclical policy was accepted or even understood.” 7 They may not have “understood” countercyclical policy, but recovery came anyway—and quickly. </p></blockquote>
<p>So let&#8217;s look at a picture that both shows what happened to tax rates and illustrates the extent of the rapid recovery. Below, I&#8217;ve graphed the top marginal income tax rate (data from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a>), and the gray shaded areas are the periods the economy was in recession information from <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">the NBER</a>) for the period from 1920 to 1940. </p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/S8XdC4XMcHI/AAAAAAAAAvY/6HLcn-ShyhE/s1600/topmarginalrates.bmp" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="194" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/S8XdC4XMcHI/AAAAAAAAAvY/6HLcn-ShyhE/s320/topmarginalrates.bmp" width="320" wt="true"></a></div>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the timing of the recovery. Unless I&#8217;m missing something, the tax cuts came after the end of the recession. That is to say, the recovery preceded the tax cuts by half of a year. Now, Woods is very precise&#8230; he says tax rates were slashed between 1920 and 1922. I for one was left with the impression that tax rates were slashed in 1921 as well as 1922, but he never quite said that. So its right, but misleading. (Its the fact that he writes so precisely about timing that leads me to believe this is not a mistake on his part, but rather that he knows what he&#8217;s doing.) But then why are the tax cuts in 1922 being given credit for a recovery that had already begun half a year earlier? Woods quotes some dude called Anderson who in turn writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The rally in business production and employment that started in August 1921</p></blockquote>
<p>Again&#8230; rapid recovery in 1921, tax cuts in 1922. Anyone see the problem with this? If Woods doesn&#8217;t, I have a bridge I&#8217;d be happy to sell him&#8230; in New York City in 1402. Unless, of course, we&#8217;re supposed to infer the classic libertarian view, which is that everyone knew a tax cut was coming and acted on the fact, Of course, anyone who was gonna act on tax cuts in August of &#8217;21 ahead probably would have acted on them in November of &#8217;20&#8230; when Harding was elected. As I understand it, Harding didn&#8217;t exactly make a secret about what he intended to do. Part of the The Return to Normalcy campaign he ran on included a rejection of Wilson&#8217;s active government. </p>
<p>But once more back to this quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Harding cut the government’s budget nearly in half between 1920 and 1922. The rest of Harding’s approach was equally laissez-faire. Tax rates were slashed for all income groups.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, one more thing slightly misleading (at least to me) but technically correct. Tax rates were slashed for all income groups, but not in 1920 or 1921 or 1922. Check the IRS link again&#8230; the folks at the bottom only got their tax cut later, in 1923. (One can see very clearly why Reagan admired Harding.) And Woods doesn&#8217;t quite say that all income groups had their tax rates slashed between 1920 and 1922, does he? </p>
<p>But we still haven&#8217;t even touched the bigger problem the graph shows. To most people, &#8220;rapid recovery&#8221; does not mean &#8220;a recovery that burns out quickly, leaving behind another recession less than 2 years later.&#8221; But that is, indeed, what happened. Call that recession &#8220;Recession # 2.&#8221; Interestingly enough, Recession #2 didn&#8217;t end until after a tax hike, which makes for a delicious detail given what Woods writes. Following the end of Recession #2, taxes are cut again. (I imagine that Woods must be thinking he can credit tax cuts for retroactively ending that recession too. Also, that buying a bridge in New York City in 1402 would allow him to charge Moses a hefty toll when he rides across on a dinosaur.) </p>
<p>OK&#8230; so there&#8217;s a tax cut, and that leads to another rapid(ly ending) recovery &#8211; Recession 3 comes around about 2 years later, in October of &#8217;26. That recession ended in November of &#8217;27. And we know what came next, right? Another rapid(ly ending) recovery (21 month long) with a tax cut!!! And this time what follows is a doozy &#8211; the Great Depression itself. </p>
<p>Note&#8230; for comparison with the policies Woods is happy about, I continued the graph through 1940. Take a gander at the period from 1933 to 1940, when that commie pinko Roosevelt was in office. I wonder if Woods would say the tax hikes Roosevelt instituted are the reason there were no rapid(ly ending) recoveries in the 1930s. </p>
<p>So let me recap, but using a bit different phrasing than Woods might use. Starting with Harding, Republican administrations repeatedly cut taxes in the 1920s. Recessions came fast and furious; in the 96 months between the end of the 1920 Depression and the start of Great Depression that followed this tax cutting bonanza, the economy was in recession 30% of the time. </p>
<p>To be honest, this doesn&#8217;t strike me as a good argument for cutting taxes, but then maybe that&#8217;s why no libertarian organization would ever contemplate giving me a prize. </p>
<p>Which leads me to my next graph&#8230; or maybe not. I haven&#8217;t even gotten to my best material, but this post is getting a bit long. Expect part 2 next week. I&#8217;ll be taking my gloves off.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>A year and a half ago <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/how-did-lehman-manage-that.html">I speculated as to how Lehman had managed to get it’s unsecured debt to be worth only 12 cents on the dollar.</a>  With my tinfoil hat firmly on, I wondered if they had written CDS on themselves.  I may just be demonstrating my ignorance of the law and institutions, but I suspect that I was essentially right.<br />LOUISE STORY and ERIC DASH have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/business/13lehman.html">an important article in the New York Times </a>in which they allege that Lehman hid investments off its balance sheet using deals with a privately held financial firm Hudson Castle and its subsidiaries.  <br />After the jump I quote them on one huge deal and explain why I think that Lehman, in effect, wrote a CDS on itself.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the vehicles that Hudson Castle created was called Fenway, which was often used to lend to Lehman, including in the summer of 2008, as the investment bank foundered. <br />[skip]<br />Lehman itself bought $3 billion of Fenway notes just before its bankruptcy that, in turn, were used to back a loan from Fenway to a Lehman subsidiary. The loan was secured by part of Lehman&#8217;s investments with a California property developer, SunCal, and those investments also collapsed.  [skip]<br />Further complicating the arrangement, Lehman later pledged those Fenway notes to JPMorgan as collateral for still other loans as Lehman began to founder. When JPMorgan realized the circular relationship, “JPMorgan concluded that Fenway was worth practically nothing,”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now my ignorance.  I will assume that the loan from JPMorgan was a full recourse full faith and credit loan – that is I will assume that since the collateral turned out to be worth less than Lehman’s debt to JPMorgan, the Lehman estate owes JPMorgan the balance.<br />It appears that Fenway’s only assets are Lehman debt and SunCal instruments both of which are in default.  If I understand the debt contract correctly (and pigs fly) JPMorgan has two claims on Lehman – that is the amount that the Lehman estate theoretically owes JPMorgan is more than the amount it owed before it collapsed.<br />My guess is that JPMorgan now owns Fenway and therefore Lehman’s debt to Fenway which would cover JPMorgan’s loan to Lehman except for the little problem that Lehman’s debt is now worth 12 cents on the dollar.  I guess this debt will be resolved eventually.  Let’s say at 12 cents on the dollar.  That would only cover 12% of Lehman’s directly contracted debt to JPMorgan (the balance of the loan).  If so JPMorgan is theoretically owed 1.88 times the amount Lehman owed it when Lehman went bankrupt.  This would mean that JPMorgan will end up with (0.12)(1.88) = 0.2256 times that amount.   <br />If I am right, the point is that bankruptcy caused a sudden increase in Lehman’s theoretical liabilities (that is the face value of its liabilities &#8212; that is the denominator of the recovery ratio whose numerator is Lehman’s assets).</p>
<p>This is just what would happen if Lehman wrote a CDS on itself.<br />Now I might be wrong and JPMorgan agreed that, if it seized the Fenway notes then the loan contract would be terminated (resolved over done) with no further recourse.  In that case, the amount Lehman owes JPMorgan is just the amount it owed JPMorgan before going bankrupt.</p>
<p>I hope this is all clear to readers, but I am totally confused.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/04/deficit-this-is-not-good-news.html">Brad DeLong</a> and <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/EconomistsView/~3/SxdOVYrOtHw/is-a-falling-deficit-good-news.html">Mark Thoma</a> posit that a falling US public deficit is bad news – they are right!</p>
<p>Deficit hysteria is now mainstream thinking, while the more appropriate hysteria should be <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/04/us-economy-on-surface-and-under-hood.html">“jobs hysteria”</a>. How in the world is nominal income growth expected to finance a drop in consumer debt leverage if the government supports a smaller deficit? TARP costs less and tax receipt growth is beating expectations. But that&#8217;s all it is, beating expectations.</p>
<p>This only proves the endogeneity of the deficit: the sole reason that the private sector is producing stronger-than-expected growth in tax receipts is BECAUSE the government ran large deficits.</p>
<p>Put it this way: as long as the US is running current account deficits, then a shrinking government deficit will, by definition, squeeze liquidity from the private sector. During a <a href="http://www.japanreview.net/review_bsr.htm">“balance sheet recession”</a>, the government should be growing its balance sheet not shrinking it.</p>
<p>An excerpt from the <a href="http://www.boj.or.jp/en/type/stop/js/js97sm.htm">Japan&#8217;s Quarterly Economic Outlook (Summary*) (Summer 1997)</a>:<br />
<blockquote>“Thus, recovery in personal consumption is expected to continue after the reaction to the rise in demand ahead of the consumption tax hike subsides in the near future. However, the pace of recovery is likely to be moderate considering the increases in the tax burden, such as the rise in the consumption tax.”</p></blockquote>
<p>RW: Boy were they wrong – moderate?</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S8S_RxTOfAI/AAAAAAAAC_8/by1Jon7qJg8/s1600/Japan_Chart.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S8S_RxTOfAI/AAAAAAAAC_8/by1Jon7qJg8/s400/Japan_Chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a><a name="more"></a> GDP fell 2.0% in 1998 (from +1.6% growth in 1997) and consumption growth turned negative over the year, -1.1% (from +0.8% in 1997). <a href="http://csis.org/files/media/csis/events/081029_japan_koo.pdf">Please see slide 9</a> from one of Richard Koo’s presentation in 2008; he highlights the policy-mistake-induced “unnecessary government deficits&#8221;. The point is: the government deficit is not some exogenous “thing” that the government controls; it’s very much endogenous and a function of private demand.</p>
<p>We’re on this road now: squeezing liquidity out of the private sector; supporting minimal wage growth; and imminent deleveraging is on the horizon(more likely the default route).  And Congress is happy that they are squeezing private sector liquidity? I guess so, as reported by the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304703104575174263375942030.html?KEYWORDS=john+d+mckinnon">Wall Street Journal yesterday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Like a number of Democrats, Mr. Blumenauer said he&#8217;s &#8220;intrigued&#8221; with the consumption-tax idea. Tax experts say consumption taxes are regressive, because lower-income people tend to spend more of their income. But a consumption tax could be designed with offsetting breaks for lower-income Americans, to shield them from its impacts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The battle over credit and debit card &#8220;swipe fees&#8221; that has been raging on Capitol Hill for the past 5 years will be heating up again soon. The credit card industry makes $125 million a day in swipe fees, so it is obvious why they are fighting to protect this &#8220;secret tax&#8221; on consumers and merchants. Check on this short interactive widget, produced by the National Association of Convenience Stores, to see why reform is so essential to Main Street retailers and consumers.</p>

<p>Is Jim Puzzangera of the Los Angeles Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wamu-inquiry13-2010apr13,0,324316.story">insinuating</a> what I think he&#8217;s insinuating ?</p>
<blockquote><p>Before Washington Mutual collapsed &#8230; its executives knowingly created &#8220;a mortgage time bomb&#8221; by steering borrowers to subprime mortgages and turning the loans into securities the company knew were likely to go bad<br />&#8230;<br />&#8220;At times, WaMu selected and securitized loans that it had identified as likely to go delinquent&#8221; or securitized loans in which the company had discovered fraudulent activity,</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds to me as if someone has the sneaking suspicion that people who knew <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/wamu-files-for-chaplev,6502/">WaMu was headed towards ChapLev</a> did that on purpose so that they could give themselves a little golden parachute by buying CDSs.</p>
<p>Stinking pond scum.  </p>
<p>I congratulate Mr Puzzanghera and almost don&#8217;t want to mention the fact that his last name is a portmanteau (portfolio ?) of the Italian words for stink and puddle.</p>

                                <p>by Marshall Auerback, Fellow and Contributor to the Roosevelt Institute&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/" target="_blank">New Deal 2.0</a></p>
<p><em>Marshall Auerback warns that Germany’s obsession with a defense against the external threat of inflation is blinding them to the real risks facing Europe.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line" target="_blank">The Maginot Line</a>, named after French Minister of Defense André Maginot, was a line of defenses which France constructed along its borders with Germany and Italy after suffering appalling damage and casualties during World War I. The French thought they were now protected from a repeat, and believed the defenses impenetrable.</p>
<p>Chatting to a number of German participants at last week’s <a href="http://ineteconomics.org/" target="_blank">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a> (INET) conference, we couldn’t help getting a sense of the economic parallel in regard to Germany’s deep resistance to greater fiscal expansion as means of dealing with the problem of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIIGS">“PIIGS“</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong>:</p>
<p>Germany’s fiscal deficit fetishism is largely a product of that country’s own hyperinflation experience during the Weimar Republic. As deeply ingrained as that trauma remains in the German psyche, it is now taking on an almost hysterically irrational quality as evidenced by the latest “rescue package” for Greece. Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Monetary_Union_of_the_European_Union" target="_blank">EMU</a> “partners”, led by Greece and soon to be followed by Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Italy, are increasingly being forced to embrace Germanic-style hair shirt economics, because the obvious fiscal response is constrained via self-imposed rules inherent in the rules governing the European Monetary Union. These rules are regarded, almost to a man, as “sound economics” by Germany’s policy makers and the vast majority of its citizens (if one is to measure this via the national polls, which continue to indicate visceral hostility to “bailouts” for “lazy Greek scroungers and tax dodgers”). We wonder if they’ll still be feeling that way if the contagion extends to Berlin and Paris.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Historians all know how effective the Maginot Line ultimately proved for the French in terms of defending a German occupation of their country during the Second World War: the Germans were able to avoid a direct assault on the Maginot Line by violating the neutrality of Belgium, Luxemburg and the Netherlands, whilst the Luftwaffe simply flew over it.</p>
<p>Likewise, we think Germany’s “Weimar 2.0″ phobia is based on similarly flawed “Maginot Line” thinking, thereby generating a correspondingly ineffectual response to the EMU crisis. It’s becoming a story of intellectual hubris, defending “good economics”, Germanic-style, over common sense.</p>
<p>Judging from the market’s reaction to the 45m euro rescue package of Greece, it appears that the EMU and, by extension, the euro, have dodged a bullet for now. But the PIIGS problems remain. The terms and conditions include IMF ‘austerity’ measures, which will act to slow the economy of Greece and the entire EU — which is already dangerously weak to the point of promoting higher budget deficits through low tax revenues and high transfer payments. All of which serves to further weaken the creditworthiness of all the member nations.</p>
<p>It also increases the euro debts of the other contributing nations because they are being forced to contribute to this funding package for Greece. The implication of the same type of ‘rescue’ for the larger euro nations is not pretty. Expect much higher levels of stress for the remaining euro member nations presumed to be ’strong’ as the same kind of forced austerity appears in store for other “violators” of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria" target="_blank">Maastricht Convergence Criteria</a>. Think about Spain, which now has 20% unemployment, or Ireland, which has a classic Iceland problem, given that the liabilities of its banking system vastly exceed the country’s overall GDP.</p>
<p>The underlying assumption of the rescue package is not sound. The stronger nations still think by offering a big enough “guarantee” the markets will take up the slack and finance Greece for them. But the markets now want to see the cash and, more importantly, they want a firm demonstration that the funding guarantees provided will help to sustain the ability of nations like Greece to service its debt without turning the nation into an industrial wasteland. The markets no longer believe in a “contingent liability” model, which is something akin to indicating that you have a rich relative who can help you out if needed. The EMU’s “rich relative” has already indicated that this is verboten, but it has denied Greece and the other PIIGS nations the means to grow adequately to service debt going forward.</p>
<p>The Prognosis:</p>
<p>The euro should therefore fundamentally remain on the weak side after a temporary bout of short-covering, as the high levels of euro national government deficits are adding the non government sectors’ holding of euro denominated financial assets. And the austerity measures are likely to increase euro government deficits and thereby exacerbates potential national insolvency problems amongst the euro zone nations.</p>
<p>The common Germanic retort to this line of thinking is that a default in, say, California, would no more threaten the viability of the dollar than a Greek default would endanger the euro. Perhaps, although the Lehman experience should have taught us all that the negative externalities of such an event can seldom be determined in advance, given the opacity of today’s funding mechanisms. Additionally, the United States of America is an existing NATIONAL fiscal authority which can respond to the growing problem of state insolvency via dollar creation and corresponding revenue sharing with the states. No such comparable fiscal entity yet exists in the euro zone.</p>
<p>Although we have hitherto characterized Greece as the EMU’s “Lehman” problem, the rescue package announced on Monday makes us that think that the better parallel for Greece might well be Bear Stearns. Bear’s “rescue” in March 2008, initially looked like it enabled the global financial markets to avert a growing crisis in the asset backed securities markets. What it did in reality was kick the can down the road, as the underlying structural problems which created the crisis in the first place remained unresolved. The credit crisis that began in August 2007 involved failure of both the liquidity and the solvency risk systems. The consequent freeze-up arose because the subsequent bankruptcy of Lehman and collapse of AIG destroyed the markets’ expectations (built up by years of bailouts) of their being an ultimate market maker, which would always be able to deal in these securitized instruments.</p>
<p>By the same token, the creation of a common currency via monetary union has created market expectations that one country’s paper is as good as another, which explains why, for so many years, “fiscally profligate” nations such as Italy were able to borrow at Germanic level interest rates. But the decision a few months ago by the European Central Bank to block a basic “repo” function — namely, the purchases of a number of European commercial banks of Greek government debt and exchanging this debt via repos with the ECB for German and French government paper is what appears to have initially triggered the Greek crisis and raised issues of Athens’s potential insolvency.</p>
<p>From what we understand, the cessation of this repo function was largely done at the behest of the Germans, who saw this activity as a kind of “back door monetization” which would lead inevitably to inflation. This, despite the fact that the entire euro zone is characterized by huge unemployment , high output gaps, and collapsing domestic consumption. All of this at the core is being driven by Germany’s pathological fear of inflation which they see as the inevitable consequence of excessive government budget deficits.</p>
<p>But Germany’s irrational fears of inflation are storing up the conditions for a far greater crisis down the line. The euro contagion could now very well spread to Italy Portugal Spain and Ireland, all of which (under the terms of this package) have to lend to Greece, at around 5%. So what happens to their funding costs? They go north of 5% as a next step. In the US, when good banks took over bad banks, they became bad banks themselves (see Bank of America and Countrywide). And what about the seniority structure of these loans? Do they subordinate Greek Government Bond holders? One assumes yes, but this is not made clear by the rescue package. In short, this appears to be a cobbled together solution, and it won’t work for a Spain or an Italy. There’s no clarity even on how it gets ratified. The EU says it’s done, but Germany and Holland say they need Parliamentary approval (which can easily be delayed).</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: in the aftermath of World War I, German production capacity was either significantly damaged, or redirected toward output required by the military. The Allied blockade further restricted imports well into 1919, and in 1923, French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr valley which held a good deal of Germany’s manufacturing base. All of these measures significantly restricted Germany’s capacity to produce, fueling the distributional conflict that fed the hyperinflation.</p>
<p>There is nothing like that today in Germany, yet “Weimar 2.0″ thinking predominates in much the same way that “Maginot Line” thinking dominated French thinking in its defense establishment. The obsession with a”defense” against the “external” threat of inflation, is blinding Germany. It doesn’t see the risk that the collapse of aggregate demand within the European Monetary Union will ultimately lead to a collapse in Germany’s export sector (a large chunk of which is the product of intra-European trade), and the corresponding extension of the “PIIGS” disease of slow growth and high unemployment to the heartland of the euro zone. We know how it ended for France, once the Maginot Line proved to be a defense more apparent than real.</p>
<p>We hope that Germany’s similarly “successful” defense of inflation does not lead to a comparably disastrous result for Europe today.</p>

                                <p>Lifted from comments.  Vtcodger summarizes his thoughts on a layman&#8217;s approach to trade and trade policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>1.  It&#8217;s pretty clear that there is no protocol for determining if a currency is under or over valued relative to another or by how much.  It&#8217;s all guesswork.  </p>
<p>2.  Foreign Exchange probably is not a marketplace that is efficient with regard to cost of goods.  Other factors like perceived stability of currencies and speculative forces probably cause exchange rates to be (considerably?) different than they would be if they were set only by cost of manufacture, shipping, and similar trade related factors.  </p>
<p>3.  Attempts to deal with trade balances between individual pairs of countries in isolation are probably going to produce dubious results.  (But that won&#8217;t keep folks from trying).  </p>
<p>4.  If one were to look at all the trade relationships on the planet, one would probably find that there is no set of  values for the currencies that makes them all &#8220;fair&#8221;.  </p>
<p>5.  The expectation that revaluing the renimbi upwards will solve US trade problems is probably nuts.  A small upward revaluation will probably help.  But for every good, once some other nation (which will rarely be the US) becomes the low cost provider, the (Multi-national companies) will simply swich providers and the Yuan exchange rate will be irrelevant to trade in that product.  Beyond a certain point, this is a lose-lose game for the US and China.</p></blockquote>

I had the pleasure of attending the conference, my first time to Cambridge. John Maynard Keynes wrote his *General Theory* at King&#8217;s College. And as if that wasn&#8217;t enough, I dined with blogging legends, Mark Thoma and Yves Smith! The photo was taken at the conference by another attendee, <a href="http://www.ofanimalsandspirits.com/post/506584844/lord-skideslky-easily-keynes-finest-biographer">Pierpaolo Barbieri</a>: &#8220;Lord Skideslky, easily Keynes’ finest biographer&#8221;.</p>
<p>The conference was a spectacular fireworks display of economic panels, featuring  experts across a broad spectrum of applied macroeconomic theory and policy, including banking and development. (You can see the speaker list, presentations, and video <a href="http://ineteconomics.org/">here</a>). Definitely read other conference pieces by <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/2010/04/09/notes-from-inet-conference-the-central-bank-as-deal-of-the-last-resort-9666/">Marshall Auerback</a>, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/04/keynes-and-hayek.html">Mark Thoma</a>, and <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/04/soros-galbraith-and-stiglitz-on-resisting-inevitability-in-greece.html">Yves Smith</a>.</p>
<p>Through INET, George Soros is funding a vision: that new and innovative macroeconomic theory prevent, rather than fuel, future “Superbubbles”. INET&#8217;s goal is the following:<br />
<blockquote>“to create an environment nourished by open discourse and critical thinking where the next generation of scholars has the support to go beyond our prevailing economic paradigms and advance our understanding of the economic system as a tool to meet social objectives.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a tall order, and likely not the intended output from the inaugural conference. But what Rob Johnson, Executive Director of INET, probably did have in mind was something of a declaration of war against outdated, disproved, or even deleterious macroeconomic policy and research. And there, I believe that he succeeded.</p>
<p>There was no shortage of criticism at the INET conference.<a name="more"></a>
<ul>
<li>Joseph Stiglitz reiterated the sharp divergence between representative agent models and reality.</li>
<li>James Galbraith went the even more aggressive route by suggesting that REH (rational expectations hypothesis), EMH (efficient markets hypothesis), RAM (representative agent models), and DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models) be buried beneath a bed of garlic below Keynes&#8217; quarters with guards standing atop the burial site. (This was not a direct quote but very close.)</li>
<li>Simon Johnson pressed the need for more action to relieve the systemic pressures coming from the still top-heavy <a href="http://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/Top50form.aspx">US banking system</a>.</li>
<li>Dominique Strauss-Kahn charged global policymakers of being complacent with monetary and fiscal policy over the last decade. They were lured in by ostensibly stable growth, when in fact the financial foundation was crumbling below (after, of course, he was disrupted by a globalization protest with the catch phrase  “the IMF is the Problem not the solution”).</li>
</ul>
<p>In my view, the fact that economists were in some sense accepting blame for policy ignorance is a step in the right direction. So what&#8217;s the next step? What will it take to move macroeconomic theory and policy in a truly innovative and novel direction? I don&#8217;t know; but I do see two issues that will likely drag the process.</p>
<p>Problem #1: the financial crisis has rendered much empirical and theoretical research obsolete; clearly, this is a solid chunk of what I refer to as the “aggregate Curriculum Vitae”. There&#8217;s a host of refereed and published literature with now documented spurious results, or entire literature reviews citing papers with theses that tread water at best.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to take time to break through the concrete wall of neo-classical macroeconomic denial (among other types of denials). This is the “old boys club”, where careers and prestige are on the line. It&#8217;s the true sense of economics as a falsifiable science: some disproved and obsolete macro theory remains ingrained in the profession as some academics, some policymakers, and some politicians cling to their reputations. This “enables” bad economic policy.</p>
<p>The good thing, though, is with funding and support from Institutes like INET, this enabling behavior cannot last forever. The aggregate may enable the profession now; but if the foundation starts to crack, i.e., the next wave of graduate students and new tenure track researchers break the mold, the profession will rebuild. I hope.</p>
<p>Problem #2. Talented researchers, early in their tenure careers or currently registered in Ph.D. programs, need incentives and professional support to publish alternative views in top journals. It&#8217;s so easy to be shunned from the academic community; just take on an unorthodox research agenda, and  bang, you&#8217;re bright and shiny career may be over before you know it. So what&#8217;s the incentive to rock the boat before establishing tenure? If tenure, by definition, is conditional on top-journal peer-refereed publications?</p>
<p>The new thinking must come from within the Ph.D programs. Building a base of new and sometimes controversial macroeconomic research that is accepted within the top academic community requires funding, but more importantly, a shift in the construct of the labor force. Macro Ph.D. programs across the world need restructuring and innovative teaching that includes an even stronger collaboration between student and adviser than existed before.</p>
<p>They say that lightning never strikes twice. Let&#8217;s hope that the economics profession avoids the second strike&#8230;this time around.</p>
