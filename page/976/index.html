                                <p>Is <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTQyYzUzZTZkZGVkZmI3MWU4YzMwYTFhNDhhOTNlMmE=">Barbara Lerner</a> advocating an invasion of Iran?  <br />
<blockquote>Only America has both the courage and the military might to save these Iranians, along with ourselves and decent people of all religions everywhere, from the new age of barbarism that threatens us all. To do that, we must ignore the Chamberlains among us and rally behind our Churchills, and we must act. In 2003, 2004, and even 2005, I thought we could rein in the mullahs without needing to attack Iran itself. I thought we could send them a sufficiently chilling message by striking the terrorist strongholds of their smaller, weaker surrogates in Syria and Hezbollahland. Now, it is too late for that. We need to get ready as quickly as possible to mount a major air assault, not just to take out as many of Iran&#8217;s nuclear sites as we can find, but to defeat the rising evil behind them by aiming our bombs and missiles at Iran&#8217;s leaders, its Revolutionary Guards, and the bully boys of the Basij too. But we cannot stop there; we also need to bomb Hezbollahland in Lebanon</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess so, which is no surprise given this:<br />
<blockquote>I think President Bush&#8217;s decision to invade Iraq and dethrone Saddam Hussein was a brave, right, and necessary decision, and an essential part of a much larger war we have no choice but to fight and win—the global, 21st-century war against Islamofascist supremacy and terror. And like many conservatives, I think the Bush administration handled the invasion of Iraq brilliantly, but made an awful mess of the post-invasion period.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Hmmm – a Biden Democrat is she?</strong>  She claims to have followed Biden in criticizing the post-invasion fiasco but then:<br />
<blockquote>In 2006, as the bloodshed in Iraq persisted and the regional situation deteriorated, I stopped criticizing our policies in Iraq for the same reason many other conservatives have lately been reluctant to do so: for fear of adding weight to a Leftist alternative that is even worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>The current rightwing rational for not criticizing this White House does seem to be it’s the fault of us liberals.  But she does admit to three mistakes:<br />
<blockquote>The surest way to draw those wrong conclusions would be to accept the analysis of the rebel generals currently baying for our Defense secretary&#8217;s head, because the three mistakes they harp on aren&#8217;t mistakes at all, and the three big mistakes we really did make weren&#8217;t made by Donald Rumsfeld. They are the mistakes of the State Department, the CIA, and the rebel generals themselves</p></blockquote>
<p>She claims that mistake #1 was NOT an inadequate number of U.S. troops and Rumsfeld’s actions to “de-Baathify the country aggressively” – but simply having Paul Bremer in charge.  She also claims we made a mistake of being too sensitive “to the finer nuances of Iraqi culture”.  Finally, she claims mistake #3 was ignoring the neighbors in the sense that she believed we shouldn’t have had military action against Iran sooner.  I guess Lerner needs to consult with Karl Rove on the calendar thing.  The crucial date in question is in November 2006 – when the National Review and the Rove Republicans need to win the war on us Democrats.  </p>
<p>I hope I’m wrong here – I hope the grownups in the Republican Party step up and demand diplomacy and not another idiotic invasion.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://talkleft.com/new_archives/014812.html">Talkleft</a> is suggesting that our military is already sending aircraft carriers towards Iran for possible air strikes this summer.  I do hope this is not the White House plan.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve discussed the shortcomings of the US&#8217;s current system of health insurance provision in great detail over the past year or so.  But new evidence keeps emerging about how poorly the US&#8217;s system performs when it comes to health outcomes (see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/performance-of-us-health-care-system.html">this post</a> for some of my earlier evidence).  </p>
<p>Last week it was <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/295/17/2037">this JAMA article</a>, which provided statistical evidence that Americans are significantly less healthy than individuals in the UK, even after controlling for differences in demographics and lifestyle.  (See Krugman&#8217;s piece about the study for more on this, as excerpted by <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/05/paul_krugman_ou.html">Mark Thoma</a>.)</p>
<p>This week new data about the relative performance of the US health care system is provided by Save the Children.  In their annual report &#8220;<a href="http://www.savethechildren.org/news/index.asp">The State of the World&#8217;s Mothers</a>&#8220;, they examine infant mortality around the world.  Marketwatch reports:<br />
<blockquote><strong>U.S. has high rate of newborn deaths</strong></p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BB72772D9-44DE-48AE-A949-FE5B51AEB8F8%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8212; Newborns in the United States have the second lowest survival rate in the industrialized world, according to a report released this week.</p>
<p>Babies in their first month of life have the best odds in Japan, which boasts the lowest newborn mortality rate of 1.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, according to a report from the nonprofit group Save the Children. Latvia had the highest mortality rate among the 33 industrialized nations surveyed, at six newborn deaths per 1,000 live births.</p>
<p>The U.S. ranked next to last and tied with Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia, which all averaged five deaths per 1,000 live births. The U.S. newborn mortality rate is nearly three times higher than that of Finland, Iceland, Norway and Japan, the study found.</p></blockquote>
<p>What do all of the countries that are most dangerous for infants have in common?  They are all among the poorest countries in the industrialized world&#8230; except for the US.  The US&#8217;s distinction is that it is the only country without universal health insurance.</p>
<p>To be fair, some of the US&#8217;s poor performance in infant mortality measures is due to differences in statistical definitions and standard medical practice.  For example, doctors in the US tend to be more aggressive about attempting to resuscitate very premature newborns than doctors elsewhere, so extremely premature infants are more likely to be classified as live births &#8211; and their deaths more likely to be classified as infant deaths &#8211; than in countries with less aggressive resuscitation policies, where such instances would tend to be classified as fetal deaths instead. </p>
<p>However, it turns out that this is not a sufficient explanation for the US&#8217;s poor performance in infant mortality measures.  Back in 1992 a CBO study called &#8220;<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6219&#038;sequence=0">Factors Contributing to the Infant Mortality Ranking of the US</a>&#8221; explicitly tried to identify why infants in the US tend to die so much more often than infants in the rest of the developed world.</p>
<p>They examined the possibility that differences in medical practice and statistical definitions are to blame.  And they found that, while they do make a bit of difference, the difference is small.  The standard measure of infant mortality placed the US at #22 in the world.  Using a modified measure that corrects for differences in definitions regarding extremely premature births did improve the US&#8217;s ranking slightly, but only slightly &#8211; to #19 in the world.</p>
<p>The CBO report concluded that the biggest culprit in the US&#8217;s poor infant mortality rates is the relative prevalence of low birthweight among newborns in the US.  For some reason, more small, unhealthy babies are born in the US than in other rich countries.  Since many other studies have repeatedly shown that the best way to prevent low birthweight babies is proper prenatal care, it seems a fair conclusion to say that insufficient prenatal care is probably the biggest single factor in explaining the US&#8217;s relatively poor infant survival rates.</p>
<p>Explaining the US&#8217;s poor infant mortality data therefore boils down to this question: why do so many women in the US seem to receive inadequate prenatal care?  Clearly, insufficient health insurance coverage for prenatal health care must be considered the leading candidate to explain this problem.  </p>
<p>So let&#8217;s chalk up another cost to the US&#8217;s patchwork system of inadequate or non-existent health insurance: thousands of preventable infant deaths every year.</p>

<blockquote>In a memoir published Tuesday, the 37-year-old lesbian describes a proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriage as a &#8220;gross affront&#8221; to gay Americans and reveals she almost quit the Republican campaign after President George W. Bush&#8217;s endorsement of the legislation two years ago. But Cheney saves her harshest words for Bush&#8217;s 2004 opponents, calling Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry a &#8220;son of a bitch&#8221; and his running mate, John Edwards, a &#8220;total slime&#8221; for discussing her sexual orientation during nationally televised debates during the campaign. The 239-page autobiography has vaulted the publicity-shy political operative back into the Washington spotlight she&#8217;s already appeared in a prime-time interview with ABC&#8217;s Diane Sawyer and provoked mixed reviews from gay rights activists who are bracing for a Senate vote next month on the Republican-sponsored gay-marriage ban. &#8220;She is a little late to the party,&#8221; said John Aravosis, a Washington gay-rights activist and political blogger. &#8220;For the longest time, Mary wouldn&#8217;t speak. Now she gets a million-dollar book advance and suddenly she is speaking. It rings a little hollow.&#8221; Cheney became a flashpoint for both sides in America&#8217;s culture wars during the 2004 campaign after Bush endorsed the constitutional ban to shore up political support on the religious right. Cheney, who served as director of her father&#8217;s re-election campaign, stayed silent when Aravosis launched a controversial Internet campaign DearMary.com pleading with her to denounce Bush. She stayed silent when Kerry, during a debate with Bush, responded to a question on whether homosexuality was a choice by telling the nation Dick Cheney had a daughter &#8220;who is a lesbian.&#8221; And she bit her tongue when a Republican Senate candidate, Alan Keyes, accused her of &#8220;selfish hedonism&#8221; for living a homosexual lifestyle. But in her book, Cheney reveals she refused to attend Bush&#8217;s 2004 State of the Union address after reading a draft copy of the speech that spoke of the need to defend the sanctity of marriage. When Bush later endorsed a constitutional amendment to expressly forbid gay marriage, Cheney &#8220;seriously considered packing up my office and heading home&#8221; to the house she shared in Colorado with her longtime partner, Heather Poe. It &#8220;gave me a knot in the pit of my stomach to think of my candidate for president endorsing the federal marriage amendment,&#8221; she writes. The gay marriage ban &#8220;would write discrimination into the constitution, our nation&#8217;s most important and influential document,&#8221; Cheney says in the book. &#8220;It is fundamentally wrong and a gross affront to gays and lesbians everywhere.&#8221; In her interview with Diane Sawyer, Cheney said of Bush: &#8220;I think he&#8217;s a very good man On these issues, he hasn&#8217;t caught up.&#8221; Cheney is less generous to Kerry and Edwards, who she accuses of &#8220;sleazy&#8221; politics for mentioning she was gay during debates with Bush and her father. &#8220;John Kerry didn&#8217;t &#8216;out me&#8217;, nor did he offend or attack me by calling me a lesbian. It wasn&#8217;t a secret that I was gay, and I certainly couldn&#8217;t be offended by the truth,&#8221; she writes. &#8220;What was offensive E was that he was obviously trying to use me and my sexual orientation for his own political gain.&#8221; Sitting in the studio audience when Edwards mentioned her sexual orientation, Cheney said she looked at the vice-presidential candidate and mouthed the words&#8221;Go F*** Yourself&#8221; a phrase her father had earlier employed against Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy.</p></blockquote>
<p>What did Senator Kerry say about Ms. Cheney?  Oh yea, that she was one of God’s children.  To which Ms. Cheney’s mother decided to help out Karl Rove’s slime machine with fake indignation.  </p>
<p>Hey it’s great that Mary is speaking out for the rights of homosexuals NOW – but she supported Bush’s reelection in 2004.  “Late to the party” indeed.  But, let’s have <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Kerry_hits_back_at_Mary_Cheney_0510.html">Senator Kerry</a> speak for himself:<br />
<blockquote>Kerry spokesman David Wade said Mary Cheney had &#8220;flacked for the most anti-gay administration in history.&#8221; “Seems like a suspicious lecture from a political operative who flacked for the most anti-gay administration in history and allowed Karl Rove to divide America for political gain,&#8221; Wade said. &#8220;She’d be more credible if she pushed dad’s administration to support hate crimes legislation and equal rights for gay Americans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Or as Ms. Cheney’s dad might say: “go f*** yourself&#8217;”.  Speaking of which, Dick Cheney mentioned his daughter’s sexuality during the 2000 Vice Presidential debate and we know he is truly a SOB.  Mary Cheney – still a tool for the rightwing who want society and the government to treat homosexuals as third class citizens (if not worse).  </p>
<p>But I should say something about economics, so let’s turn to <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/column/120600.html">Paul Krugman</a> who notes that Dick Cheney is a Vulgar Keynesian:<br />
<blockquote>First, on their face Mr. Cheney&#8217;s remarks were those of a vulgar Keynesian &#8211; a believer in the now- discredited doctrine that taxes and spending should be routinely twiddled in an attempt to &#8220;fine-tune&#8221; the economy.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Welcome back Kash and thanks for <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/raising-future-taxes-yet-again.html">this post</a>!  I trust you saw those <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/cato-unbound-what-tax-increases-would.html">Cato Unbound</a> discussions – and it seems <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/05/10/david-frum/reply-to-comments-small-successes-are-big-achievements">David Frum</a> is still as confused as ever:<br />
<blockquote>If we must have tax increases, the VAT would not be one of my choices, for the reason Summers predicts &#8211; I fear it will generate so much revenue as to accelerate government spending. I’d look instead at Irwin Stelzer’s idea of a tax on oil and natural gas. I’d also want to consider taxing employer-provided health insurance as income: not only would such a tax be highly progressive, but it would also advance the important policy goal of severing health insurance from employment. Bartlett’s idea at least has the great merit of forcing conservatives to recognize that President Bush’s tax-cutting achievements have been rendered unstable by over-spending — and that the GOP’s failure to act on spending today threatens to guarantee tax increases in the future. I agree with Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam about the importance of addressing the social problems that drive the growth of government &#8230; But the health care problem is not beyond the reach of sensible policy — which is why by the way I think Gov. Romney’s Massachusetts health care reforms deserve conservative support.</p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, let me suggest that I’m closer to Frum than to Bartlett on which taxes should be raised.  And I’m elated that he is coming around to our position on health care reforms – especially since he worked for a White House that opposed our positions and even took steps to make health care even more inefficient and costly.  But he still argues that tax cutters (ah, I meant tax deferrers) like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush do better in limiting government spending than fiscally responsible leaders like Bill Clinton.  Never mind the evidence says otherwise.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/09/AR2006050901214.html">Robert Samuelson</a> writes (and <a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/05/factoid_of_the_.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> takes note):<br />
<blockquote>Social spending and regulation (for education, anti-poverty programs, health care, the environment) have consistently expanded. In 1954 defense accounted for 69.5 percent of federal spending and &#8220;human resources&#8221; (programs such as Social Security, Medicare, job training and food stamps) only 18.5 percent. In 2005 defense was 20 percent and human resources 64.2 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sulli suggests that the military-industrial complex has been replaced by the “senior-entitlement complex”.  Measuring expenditure items as percentages of the Federal budget can produce some shock statistics, but it strikes me as an odd way to evaluate this issue.  My preference would be to look at these items as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/2006-year-of-small-government.html">percentages of GDP</a> over time – and yes, defense spending as a share of GDP is less today than it was during the Cold War.  I guess Robert “not Paul” Samuelson agrees with Sulli that the government should turn back the clock fifty years on the War on Poverty and providing a defined benefits retirement system.  Sorry fellows – but I beg to differ.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: Three Republican Senators voted against that INCREASE in FUTURE TAXES –Olympia J. Snowe, Lincoln Chafee, and George Voinovich.  While I applaud them, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NWNhMzQzZDdkMzBiMWM0M2IxOTUxZjE4NWE3ZDFmN2Y=">John Miller</a> does not.  I guess the folks at the National Review have no clue what <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/raising-future-taxes-yet-again.html">Kash</a> was trying to tell everyone.  Thank goodness that 3 Republican Senators get the simple point and had there been 48 Democrats in the Senate to vote against this irresponsibility, it would not have passed.</p>
<p><strong>Final Update</strong>: I was wrong &#8211; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/11/tax.cuts.ap/index.html">CNN</a> lets us know there were 3 pandering Democrats in the Senate: <br />
<blockquote>Democrats Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Bill Nelson of Florida and Mark Pryor of Arkansas voted in favor. Republican Gordon Smith of Oregon originally registered a &#8220;nay&#8221; vote but changed to &#8220;aye&#8221; just before the tally was announced. Republicans said to fail to extend the tax cuts would amount to a tax increase on investors, big and small, as well as on families facing the alternative minimum tax. They&#8217;ve dubbed the bill the &#8220;Tax Increase Prevention Act.&#8221; &#8220;Are we going to increase taxes on well over 100 million people &#8230; or are we going to keep takes low?&#8221; said Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tennessee. Appearing with Frist and other GOP senators, Treasury Secretary John Snow said, &#8220;This is a defining day. A vote today will tell the American people who supports lower taxes and who doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Our Treas. Sec. should be named <strong>Jack the Hack</strong>.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The FOMC (the interest rate-setting committee at the Fed) raised the Federal Funds rate to 5.0% today.  Here&#8217;s the important bit of <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/monetary/2006/20060510/">the accompanying statement</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Economic growth has been quite strong so far this year. The Committee sees growth as likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.</p>
<p>As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures.</p>
<p>The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.</p></blockquote>
<p>For many successive meetings (i.e. most of 2004 and 2005) the Fed&#8217;s statement was almost unchanged.  But over the past two meetings the statement has decidedly evolved, and now can fairly be interpreted as signalling the end of certainty regarding further future interest rate hikes.  Put another way, while the FOMC could still raise rates a bit higher, I think that this statement now suggests that they will only do so if they get more signals that inflation is rising.  </p>
<p>Regardless of how you interpret this specific statement, however, one thing seems sure: it will be a lot more interesting (and difficult) to try to guess what the FOMC is going to do to interest rates over the next few months than it has been at any time in the past couple of years.</p>

                                <p>Well, it looks like they finally did it.  Congressional Republicans agreed yesterday on new ways to raise future taxes.  They&#8217;ve proven quite expert at cutting today&#8217;s taxes and paying for them by issuing more government debt &#8211; debt that will have to be repaid in the future through higher taxes, of course &#8211; so this comes as little surprise to most observers.  The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/09/AR2006050900651.html">Washington Post</a> has details of this latest round of tax <strike>cuts</strike> deferrals:<br />
<blockquote><strong>GOP Reaches Deal on Tax <strike>Cuts</strike> [Deferrals]</strong></p>
<p>House and Senate Republican negotiators reached a final agreement yesterday on a five-year, nearly $70 billion tax package that would extend President Bush&#8217;s deep cuts to tax rates on dividends and capital gains, while sparing about 15 million middle-income Americans from the alternative minimum tax.</p></blockquote>
<p>Who gets the tax <strike>cuts</strike> deferrals?  Again, it&#8217;s pretty much par for the course that Congressional Republicans have been playing on for the past five years:<br />
<blockquote>Middle-income households would receive an average tax cut of $20 from the agreement, according to the joint Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, while 0.02 percent of households with incomes over $1 million would receive average tax cuts of $42,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, proponents argue that even if these tax <strike>cuts</strike> deferrals are extraordinarily unevenly tilted toward the super-rich, they will help to boost the economy, as they have over the past three years.  This claim that the tax cuts in dividends and capital gains are responsible for dramatic economic growth is nonsense (for details about why, see previous posts about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/capital-taxation-and-growth.html">the international evidence</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/more-on-state-of-economy.html">the strength of the post-tax cut recovery</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/budgetary-effects-of-bush-tax-cuts.html">the budgetary effects of the tax cuts</a>, or <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/rest-of-story.html">the rest of the story</a> about the Bush tax cuts), but that clearly will not stop the White House from repeating that assertion over and over:<br />
<blockquote>Republicans say those tax cuts were crucial to spurring economic growth over the past three years, by persuading more corporations to offer larger dividends and by sparking new business investment.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8221;It was as if a light switch has been thrown on,&#8221; Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said yesterday. &#8220;Rarely has a piece of public policy been so effective, with the effects so evident and immediate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some economists say the timing of those gains was coincidental. &#8220;You might credit the cuts with providing a little bit of a jump-start. But I think the main reason the economy has done so well the last couple of years has nothing to do with tax policy, and more to do with the corporate sector starting to spend some of their record profits,&#8221; said Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist of the Lehman Brothers investment bank.</p></blockquote>
<p>One could come up with many ways to describe Secretary Snow&#8217;s &#8220;light switch&#8221; argument: specious logic; ignorant confusion of correlation with causation; deliberate simple-mindedness; or even the &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/2003-tax-cut-and-economic-growth.html">Donald Duck theory of economic growth</a>&#8220;.  Whichever label you choose, it is, unfortunately, also just par for the course.</p>

<blockquote>A pattern is emerging in pre-trial arguments in the perjury and obstruction of justice case against former Cheney chief of staff Lewis Libby. That pattern is the recurring conflict between the Little Case and the Big Case. The Little Case is the narrow, tightly defined charge that Libby lied to prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald&#8217;s grand jury. For example, did Libby lie when he testified that NBC&#8217;s Tim Russert &#8220;said to me, did you know that Ambassador Wilson&#8217;s wife…works at the CIA? And I said, no, I don&#8217;t know that&#8221;? Did Libby lie when he testified that, when speaking to journalists about the information that Valerie Plame Wilson worked at the CIA, &#8220;I was very clear to say reporters are telling us that because in my mind I still didn&#8217;t know it as a fact&#8221;? If Fitzgerald had his way, that is all the case would be about. At every hearing, and in every court filing, he has argued that the case is simply a matter of a few specific false statements allegedly made by Libby. Nothing else matters &#8211; just the Little Case.</p></blockquote>
<p>After all, no one at the National Review ever made a big deal about Clinton lying about his sex life – right?  But what Mr. York fails to admit is that Libby did more than simply lie.  He obstructed the investigation of the “Big Case”.  </p>
<p>Then again – Mr. York has also said it was no big deal that Robert Novak told the world that Valerie Plame was a CIA agent since Mr. York and his NRO colleagues have repeatedly claimed that was common knowledge before July 2003.  Of course, these NRO folks lie when they say that, but then dishonesty for them is no big deal.</p>

                                <p>First off, apologies to everyone for my extended hiatus.  It&#8217;s been almost four weeks since I&#8217;ve posted, which is the longest stretch that I&#8217;ve been missing since I starting writing on Angry Bear nearly three years ago.  But the past few weeks have been a pretty busy time for me in more than the usual sense, due to lots of major changes in my personal life (mostly having to do with moving, buying a house, and changing jobs).  Tons of credit and kudos go to PGL for keeping the ship sailing almost single-handedly while I was out of action.  (Hmmm&#8230; let&#8217;s see how many metaphors I can mix in one post&#8230;)</p>
<p>The next few weeks also promise to be pretty filled with things that will try to keep me on the sidelines, but even if I can&#8217;t get back to my usual rate of output I do plan on writing at least a little, starting today&#8230;</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=13885">Human Events</a> lists its top ten.   I hate to agree with these rightwing zealots but farm subsidies and earmarking should make this list.  And I’ll give credit to Human Events for placing some of the blame on the Republican Party.  #3 on their lists confuses income tax withholding with income tax rates – and perhaps these fellows should realize that every dollar the government spends has to be collected in taxes eventually from some source.  McCain-Feingold and funding of contraceptives as an alternative to more unplanned pregnancies, which might end up in abortion are bad policies???  Medicare, Medicaid, Affirmative Action, and the Davis-Bacon Act are other areas where I would take exception to their list.</p>
<p><strong>But there #1 bad government program is – surprise, surprise – Social Security!</strong> And what is wrong with a publicly run defined benefits program?</p>
<blockquote><p>The program has socialized the retirement of Americans, making most seniors financially dependent on payments that the federal government may alter, decrease or even cancel … Social Security collected $657.7 billion in taxes in 2004 and paid out $501.6 billion in benefits. Congress spent every penny of the $156.1-billion Social Security surplus on non-Social Security items.</p></blockquote>
<p>I see – the lack of fiscal discipline from the Republican Congress and President Bush is taking the funds that are supposed to be dedicated to the retirement of working class Americans and giving them to high income individuals in the form of income tax reductions.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/05/deficit_hawks_w.html">Brad DeLong</a> treats us to the latest from <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/5-1-06socsec.htm">Jason Furman and Robert Greenstein</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Anyone concerned about Social Security’s long-term impact on the federal budget ought to be even more concerned about the long-term fiscal impact of extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.  If made permanent, the tax cuts will cost nearly three times as much, over the next 75 years, as the 75-year deficit in Social Security</p></blockquote>
<p>Or as Brad says:<br />
<blockquote>Anyone who claims to be a &#8220;deficit hawk&#8221; who favors extending Bush&#8217;s tax cuts is not a deficit hawk, but a deficit turkey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking of turkeys, check out the latest spin from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/08/AR2006050801561.html">Allan Sloan</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Cash is what matters, because Social Security&#8217;s multitrillion-dollar trust fund, consisting of IOUs from the U.S. Treasury, won&#8217;t help the federal government cover shortfalls when the program begins taking in less than it spends. The shortfalls are projected to start at about $11 billion in 2017.</p></blockquote>
<p>By 2017, benefit payments may start to exceed payroll contributions – but guess what, reserves will continue to rise for a few more years. <a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/05/post-columnist-advocates-default-on.html">Dean Baker</a> comments:<br />
<blockquote>Washington Post columnist Allan Sloan called for defaulting on the U.S. national debt, or at least a portion of it … Mr. Sloan probably would object to describing his column as a call for default on the national debt, but this in fact exactly what it is. In the column, he implicitly derides the legitimacy of the bonds held by Social Security by calling them IOUs. Of course all bonds are IOUs, but they are never described this way in normal discussions.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a final note, during yesterday’s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/progressive-tax-cut-what-tax-cut.html">progressivity debate</a>, a 2004 discussion of Social Security by <a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=121004A">Arnold Kling</a> was mentioned:<br />
<blockquote>For the Left, the Achilles heel of Social Security is the regressive payroll tax that is used to fund it. Social Security taxes soak up a much larger share of the income of the average worker than of the affluent. Income taxes, on the other hand, have become increasingly progressive.</p></blockquote>
<p>This discussion makes sense ONLY IF one ignores the distribution of benefits across income groups.  While I might be tempted to suggest that this oped ranks as one of Arnold’s worst, maybe he was forecasting that Allan Sloan’s suggestion might become reality.  </p>
<p>As far as the Social Security program – with modest adjustments to the benefit structure to be paid to future retirees – this program can be solvent.  But then I’m assuming that we can prevent Allan Sloan, the Human Events, and Bush wing of the Republican Party from stealing the Trust Fund reserves to pay for goodies for the rich paid for by our payroll contributions.  And yes – that is a very big assumption!</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: Some of the more informed AB readers want me to find something to rebut the spin from JoshK who claims that giving people their money back allows them to get a better return than they would get from putting their money in the publicly run defined benefits program known as Social Security.  I have often mentioned Robert Barro’s July 2000 Business Week op-ed that said this free lunch proposition was bunk and more recently I linked to another conservative economist who agree with Barro – that being <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006321">Gary Becker</a>:<br />
<blockquote>It is true, as some critics observe, that there is no magical gain in privatizing Social Security, since all systems have to provide incomes for retired persons &#8230; Contrary to the Bush position, however, I do not believe that the main advantage of a private-account system is that individuals can get a higher return on their old-age savings by investing in stocks. There are no freebies from such investments since the higher return on stocks is related to their greater risk and other trade-offs between stocks and different assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have made this point in several posts and this point has been made by a number of economists – both conservative and liberal.  Yet – George W. Bush still argues there must be some free lunch, so why should we be surprised that his loyal followers think the same thing?</p>

                                <p>This afternoon I received an email from the National Republican Senatorial Committee.  What really stood out is that the NRSC has only one talking point: Vote GOP or Bush might be impeached!  An excerpt:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The Washington Post reported this week that House and Senate Democrats are salivating over the possibility of convening hearings on everything from the War in Iraq to the National Security Agency&#8217;s terrorist surveillance program.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  I am still a registered Republican, and most Republicans I&#8217;ve spoken with are upset about Bush&#8217;s fiscal policies, his handling of the War in Iraq and the erosion of their civil liberties.  This email seems intended to urge Republicans to vote Democrat in 2006.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;They want nothing more than to create a three-ring political circus they know will get favorable coverage from the liberal media so that they can discredit, and then undo the Bush tax cuts and other important elements of the Bush agenda.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  Ignoring the &#8220;liberal media&#8221; canard, I support undoing most of the Bush tax cuts as a first step in restoring fiscal responsibility.   Also I&#8217;m not sure of what the &#8220;other important elements of the Bush agenda&#8221; are &#8211; and apparently the NRSC couldn&#8217;t think of anything either!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the unpopular President Bush&#8217;s approval ratings have sunk to new lows in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/washington/09cnd-poll.html">New York Times/CBS News Poll</a>.  It looks like most Americans are ready for change. I know I am.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE2:</strong> Meyerson at the WaPo picks up the same theme: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/09/AR2006050901504.html">The GOP&#8217;s Bankruptcy of Ideas</a><br />
<blockquote>The emerging Republican game plan for 2006 is, at bottom, a tautology: If the Democrats retake Congress it will mean, well, that the Democrats retake Congress. (Cue lightning bolt and ominous clap of thunder.) Karl Rove and his minions have plumb run out of issues to campaign on.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Here is the entire email:<br />
<blockquote>I want to share with you what I believe to be one of the dangers of a Democrat victory this November.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s becoming clear that if the liberal Democrat leadership takes control of Congress, they will embark on a destructive agenda of politically motivated &#8220;investigations&#8221; of President Bush and his administration. </p>
<p>The Washington Post reported this week that House and Senate Democrats are salivating over the possibility of convening hearings on everything from the War in Iraq to the National Security Agency&#8217;s terrorist surveillance program. </p>
<p>They want nothing more than to create a three-ring political circus they know will get favorable coverage from the liberal media so that they can discredit, and then undo the Bush tax cuts and other important elements of the Bush agenda. </p>
<p>And it&#8217;s even likely that Democrats &#8211; should they take over the House and Senate &#8211; will try to impeach President Bush. </p>
<p>Senator Russ Feingold has a measure pending on the Senate floor that would &#8220;censure&#8221; the President over his efforts to stop terrorism.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago on a national news program, Senator Durbin of Illinois, the second most powerful Democrat leader in the Senate, refused to rule out the eventual impeachment of President Bush.</p>
<p>The likely Democrat Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee (where impeachment begins), has already made it clear that he supports such action. Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) has already sponsored a resolution calling for an investigation with the clear aim of initiating impeachment proceedings against President Bush. Already, 35 Democrats plus Senate candidate Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have signed on as cosponsors. </p>
<p>And this week on Meet The Press, House Democrat Leader Nancy Pelosi (who will likely become Speaker if Democrats take control of the House) said of the possibility of impeachment: &#8220;you never know where the facts take you.&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, I think it&#8217;s pretty clear where the Democrats will take us. </p>
<p>If Democrats control the House and Senate, there will be a series of irresponsible hearings, and President Bush will be impeached. That&#8217;s not the kind of &#8220;leadership&#8221; this country needs, and that&#8217;s one of the reasons we need your help to prevent Democrats from taking control of the Senate.</p>
<p>The Senate is our last line of defense against the ultra-liberal coalition of fringe groups and their friends in Congress. We cannot allow them to hijack the government and use it as a vehicle for their angry, revenge politics. <a href="http://www.gopsenators.com/newsdesk/article.aspx?ID=2268">Click here to read the Washington Post article I referred to</a>, which spells out exactly what Democrats are preparing to do if they take control of Congress. </p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll forward this article to your friends, and spread the word about how important this election is. You can also learn more about the NRSC here and how to get involved the 2006 Senate races by clicking here.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
