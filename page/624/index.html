<blockquote><p>Accordingly, the NASA Office of Inspector General conducted an administrative investigation to examine reports of alleged “political interference,” predominantly by senior NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs officials, with the work of NASA scientists pertaining to climate change—to include whether NASA inappropriately prevented one of its scientists, Dr. James E. Hansen, from speaking to the media in December 2005.<br />Our investigation found that during the fall of 2004 through early 2006, the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs managed the topic of climate change in a manner that reduced, marginalized, or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public through those particular media over which the Office of Public Affairs had control (i.e., news releases and media access). We also concluded that the climate change editorial decisions were localized within the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs; we found no credible evidence suggesting that senior NASA or Administration officials directed the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs to minimize information relating to climate change. To the contrary, we found that once NASA leadership within the Office of the Administrator were made aware of the scope of the conflict between the Office of Public Affairs and scientists working on climate change, they aggressively implemented new policies with a view toward improved processes in editorial decision-making relating to scientific public affairs matters.<br />Further, it is our conclusion that the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs’ actions were inconsistent with the mandate and intent of NASA’s controlling legislation—the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 19581 (Space Act) and NASA’s implementing regulations—insomuch as they prevented “the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination” of information concerning NASA’s activities and results. While we could not substantiate that Administration officials employed outside NASA approved or disapproved or edited specific news releases, we do, however, find by a preponderance of the evidence2 that the claims of inappropriate political interference made by the climate change scientists and career Public Affairs Officers were more persuasive than the arguments of the senior Public Affairs officials that their actions were due to the volume and poor quality of the draft news releases.</p>
<p>1 The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-568, 72 Stat. 426 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 2451 et. seq. [2007]).<br />2 Preponderance of the evidence is a standard of proof that simply requires that the matter asserted seems more likely true than not.</p>
<p>Although the scientific information alleged to be “suppressed” appeared to be otherwise available through a variety of Agency forums, we cannot reconcile that the Space Act would permit any purposeful obfuscation of scientific research by the Agency in any news dissemination forum as “appropriate” under the Act.</p></blockquote>
<p>No one has published the <em>draft news releases </em>for us, however.</p>

<blockquote><p>By overlooking the problems created by trade in instances where regulatory arbitrage does play an important role, we miss the opportunity to celebrate the kind of globalization where such arbitrage doesn&#8217;t play a role. The latter type of trade probably constitutes the bulk of world trade. But because economists do not make this important distinction, they have no language or ability with which they can respond appropriately to the uneasiness out there&#8211;except for calling it irrational.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>By: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>From this story at <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/06/10/9534/">Common Dreams</a> comes the news that Senator Obama has chosen Jason Furman as an economic advisor.  The story notes Mr. Furman&#8217;s fame for his defending of the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/kf/walmart_progressive.pdf">Walmart model</a>. The one that states Walmart is helping the less fortunate.   I don&#8217;t buy it in the big picture scheme of viewing.  In fact, we at AB have had this discussion and I even posted a link to a report from the EPI which noted not everything related to ones financial well being can be bought at Walmart.  Frankly, there are some very big items that are not on Walmart&#8217;s shelves that take up a large portion of ones budget.</p>
<p>He has held a good <a href="http://wagner.nyu.edu/faculty/facultyDetail.php?whereField=facultyID&#038;whereValue=323">position at the Brookings</a>.  Note that bit about director of economic policy for the Kerry/Edwards campaign.  Not to keen on the Hamilton Project though:<br />
<blockquote>The offices belong to the Hamilton Project, a small think tank created by Robert E. Rubin, Bill Clinton&#8217;s Treasury secretary and key economic adviser, and former Treasury deputy secretary Roger C. Altman, who would be a front-runner for the same job in a new Clinton administration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this the concession the Clinton/Blue Dog group was looking for?  The DLC still keeps control of the money issues?  <a href="http://www.inclusionist.org/node/1413">This article</a> suggests some recent Hamilton Project influencing.Do we really need Chicago School lite?  Are we that timid that we couldn&#8217;t try another school of thought?  Now that would be “change”. </p>
<p>Then I read this in the Common Dreams article:<br />
<blockquote>One economist who has disputed some of Mr. Furman’s findings on Wal-Mart said the disagreement shouldn’t disqualify him. “That’s small potatoes. Jason’s economic agenda goes way beyond that,” Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute said. “That’s not anything close to a deal breaker.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well ok?  If the EPI can say there is more to this young man than Walmart, I need to go looking.  I found this from Mr. Furman&#8217;s article on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/26/AR2007102601860.html">corporate taxes</a>: <br />
<blockquote>“We should consider tax reform in the classic 1986 mode: lower tax rates and broaden the tax base by limiting special exemptions. Both halves of this classic equation have the potential for helping the economy by eliminating the perverse incentives to invest in tax-favored activities rather than in more economically productive activities. “</p></blockquote>
<p>Alrighty, there is more to his thinking.  He relates our <a href="http://www.democracyjournal.org/printfriendly.php?ID=6466">health care problems to the tax code </a>also:<br />
<blockquote>Not only do we spend more than any other country on health care, nearly 50 percent more per capita than the second-highest-spending nation, but citizens in 28 other countries have a higher life expectancy and 33 other nations have lower infant mortality rates.</p>
<p>If this were a government-run health care system, the voting public and policymakers would be up in arms. Yet, perhaps because health care is largely perceived as a private-sector concern, there is relative quiet: while voters tell pollsters that it is a top priority, there appears not to be comparable political pressure for serious reform or any fundamental change in the government’s involvement, either in the provision or funding of health care. This is in part because much of the federal government’s involvement with the health care system is through the hidden backdoor of the tax code. An importantprinciple for modern progressives is that when the government has to intervene in the marketplace, it should not prop up failure. Yet the federal government is, in fact, deeply involved in perpetuating the current &#8220;private&#8221; health care system and all its flaws, spending approximately $200 billion annually in subsidizing employer-provided insurance. It is the single biggest subsidy in our tax system, more than twice as costly as the mortgage interest deduction. The only government programs that cost more are Social Security, national defense, and Medicare.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting perspective&#8230;yes?  But, I&#8217;m not so sure he is correct with the solution, though I can now see why Senator Obama has put him at the table:<br />
<blockquote>In fact, if we turned our irrational health tax subsidies right-side up–by curbing subsidies for higher-income workers and those with more generous health insurance plans–we could raise tens of billions of dollars annually, money that could go toward increasing access to health insurance. Taking it a step further, we could scrap the current deduction altogether and replace it with progressive tax credits that, together with other changes, would ensure that every American has affordable health insurance.</p></blockquote>
<p> Not exactly a Mrs. Edward solution if I have read her correctly.  </p>
<p>This person, Mr. Furman seems to fit well with Senator Obama&#8217;s other econ advisor, Mr. Austan Goolsbee.  I think we can now start making some educated guess on what to expect for proposed solutions to the shift of income share to the top 1%.  You know: It&#8217;s the economy stupid, Show me the money, declining real wages, consumer economy with little to spend, (add your&#8217;s here&#8230;).  We&#8217;re going to try a new version of trickle down which has some form of tax code tightening, but no direct social policy influencing.  Social influencing, like say, we use the tax code to make it more profitable for the company to pay the help as oppose to paying the very top management and shareholders.</p>

<p>June 5th, 2008 by admin </p>
<p>EPA is holding an on-line discussion among state, tribe, and other federal partners of EPA, as well as the public to foster collaboration on information access. For this discussion, we are using a blog which is a more interactive and personal form of technology. Everyone is invited to use this site to identify and share their best resources, tools, and ideas for improving access to EPA’s environmental information. This is a key part of the <a href="http://blog.epa.gov/partners/">National Dialogue on Access to Environmental Information</a> – working with you to enhance information access.</p>

<p>I guess the McBush jokes have gotten to <a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0610/uselection.html">John McCain</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr McCain hit back by portraying Senator Obama as a tax-and-spend liberal in the mould of 1970s president Jimmy Carter, when the last sustained surge in oil prices combined with high inflation to plunge the US economy into crisis.</p></blockquote>
<p>This crack is stupid at so many levels.  First of all – oil prices have already skyrocketed under George W. Bush.  <a href="http://www.oilandgasconfidential.com/Historical_Crude_Prices.html">This source</a> shows that oil prices average $23 a barrel back in 2001 as opposed to the current market price near $137 a barrel.  OK, inflation adjusted to today’s prices, the real price of oil averaged $27.29 a barrel back in 2001.  It is hard to pin this down on some future policies of a President Obama.  </p>
<p>Our graph shows Federal spending as a percent of GDP from 1969 to 1992- a 24-year span where Republican Administrations were in office for all but the 4 years that Carter was President. Were Nixon and Ford tax-and-spend liberals as well?  And I guess Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were Marxists!  <br />Maybe we should remind McCain that the Federal debt to GDP ratio fell from 35.8% in 1977 to 32.6% in 1981.  Under George W. Bush’s spend and borrow but never tax policies – the ones McCain would like to augment – the Federal debt to GDP ratio rose from 57.4% in 2001 to a projected 69.3% for 2009.  <br />Maybe we should also remind McCain that employment growth during the Carter years was sufficiently strong so as to have the employment-population ratio rise from 57.0% as of January 1977 to 59.1%.  As of January 2001, this ratio was 64.4% but is now only 62.6%.  In a word – employment growth since Bush took office has sucked.  </p>
<p>I know some folks look upon Carter’s years as President as not exactly our finest hour.  But if McCain wants to tout the economic record of George W. Bush as being clearly better, he really is a fool.</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>In BusinessWeek, Jane Sasseen&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/bw/20080606/bs_bw/0824b4088081624555">Taxing the &#8216;Not-So-Rich&#8217; Rich</a>&#8221; tries to make me feel, uh, well, here&#8217;s the lede:<br />
<blockquote>By any measure, Dr. Howard Hammer and his wife, Hope, have a comfortable life. Hammer, 40, has built a thriving practice as an ear, nose, and throat specialist, while Hope, 39, has switched to part-time work as a real estate lawyer after years at a big firm in order to spend more time with [the kids]. Home is a four-bedroom house in the Philadelphia suburbs, and between them, they bring in over $300,000 a year. &#8220;We can&#8217;t complain,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;re certainly not struggling.&#8221;</p>
<p>But are they wealthy? That&#8217;s far more debatable&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Granted, income is a flow and wealth is a stock.  There&#8217;s nothing much beyond self-control that would prevent a family with a 97th-percentile income a la the Hammers from spending drunken sailors under the table (if perhaps in ways the drunken sailors would find dull), seeing as the modern economy&#8217;s undeniable talent is providing an array of goods and services capable of relieving anyone of their money for arbitrary values of &#8220;their money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, a regularity of the income-and-wealth data is that households with $300,000/year incomes also tend to be in high percentiles of the wealth distribution.  In the Fed&#8217;s <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/2004/scf2004home.html">2004 Survey of Consumer Finances</a>, for example, households in the 75th-90th percentile range for the wealth distribution had a median income of $77,000 (in 2004 dollars) and a mean income of $87,800.  So there&#8217;s some skew to the income distribution for people in that wealth fractile, but you can conclude that there aren&#8217;t too many people making $300,000/year who aren&#8217;t also in the top 10% of the wealth distribution.  At least, they&#8217;re for the most part rapidly on the way there.</p>
<p>And, sure enough, most people would probably be glad to have the financial stresses of the $300,000/year set:<br />
<blockquote>Ever-rising prices for gas, health insurance, and other expenses are hitting hard, as are the $3,000-a-month mortgage and the $2,000 he still pays monthly to whittle down his $160,000 medical school debt. A six-year residency gave Hammer a delayed start saving for retirement, so he worries if he&#8217;s stashing enough in his 401(k). By the time the couple contributes to the children&#8217;s college fund, there&#8217;s little extra at the end of the month.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s the horror of only having a little bit to save after socking away money for two of the main savings motives.  If they actually had to get to the point of curtailing their other savings, I&#8217;m quite sure that they could sharpen their pencils before their credit cards got maxed out.</p>
<p>Now you might recall that the upper-middle and upper classes did relatively well in that <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784">long national nightmare of peace and prosperity</a> known as the Clinton (I) years.  However, Dr. Hammer would have us know that he&#8217;s not really a Republican but, he tells BW:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind paying my fair share, but people act like they&#8217;re just talking about Bill Gates,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We would definitely feel a hit if our taxes went up.&#8221; Although a year ago he would not have considered voting Republican in November, now he&#8217;s not so sure: &#8220;Do you vote your heart, or do you vote your wallet?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This looks like rather narrow pocketbook-voting insofar as Republican policies haven&#8217;t exactly helped with stuff like education, transportation, and health insurance prices and costs.  In a longer view the kids might be less than thankful for the taxes deferred to the next generation.  Perhaps Dr. Hammer is persuadable.</p>
<p>The BW piece seems to predict a major line of attack against Obama in the fall, namely that he&#8217;s planning the biggest middle-class tax increase EVER.  After all, a little rebranding (&#8220;death tax&#8221;) plus relentless marketing made a popular cause of relieving the super-rich of a tax burden nearly nobody is fortunate enough to bear, and if you&#8217;re a one-trick pony&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>But many also live in high-cost areas with expenses to match &#8212; and feel burned by talk of &#8220;taxing the rich&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t recognize that $250,000 stretches a lot further in the South or the Midwest than in Manhattan or Silicon Valley. &#8220;There is a huge difference between what politicians define as rich and what many Americans would call middle class,&#8221; says Patrick Anderson, CEO of the Anderson Economic Group and co-editor of The State Economic Handbook.</p>
<p>The soaring deficit, along with the fact that the Bush tax cuts expire at the end of 2010, provide much of the impetus for the coming fight over high-end taxes. If Washington doesn&#8217;t act, tax rates on income, capital gains, dividends, and other areas will return to the higher rates in effect before the cuts were enacted in 2001 and 2003. Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.)&#8230; has said he would extend the cuts for everyone, while Obama says he&#8217;ll maintain them for all but the wealthiest. If Obama wins, some taxes could go up as soon as 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p>It falls to Austan Goolsbee to remind everyone that you can get &#8220;many&#8221; by multiplying small fractions and the population of the United States, and besides the far upper tail of the income distribution is the only group that&#8217;s systematically done well under Bushonomics:<br />
<blockquote>Austan Goolsbee, Obama&#8217;s top economic advisor, points out that only a relatively small number of high-end earners would be tapped, while the majority of Americans would see their taxes fall or remain the same. &#8220;Income growth in that group has been extremely rapid, while it&#8217;s been stagnant for everyone else,&#8221; says Goolsbee. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to argue they face the same struggle to get by.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>No kidding.  And the sob stories may even get a little much for Ms. Sasseen, who closes thusly:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;People think the President can just extend the cuts, but he can&#8217;t,&#8221; says Stanford Group&#8217;s [Anne] Mathias. All of which explains why Mathias has been warning her clients that the next couple of years &#8220;will be a very bad time to be rich.&#8221; Whatever, precisely, that means.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/world/la/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10566845">The Economist </a> reports on troubles in Mexico around corn tortillas.  Last year there were demonstrations about a significant rise in prices for corn tortillas.</p>
<p>From research I learned <a href="http://www.american.edu/TED/TORTILLA.HTM">that 50% of the people in Mexico earn $5</a> or less per day, with the corn tortilla being the mainstay of diet&#8230;Indeed, the average Mexican consumes 120 kg of tortillas every year. Tortillas constitute more than half the daily calories and protein of Mexico&#8217;s poor. </p>
<blockquote><p>Nevertheless, the Mexican maize crop has grown from 18m tonnes before NAFTA to 24m tonnes last year. This, says Jaime Serra Puche, the trade minister when NAFTA was negotiated, is a problem rather than a success. Growing maize efficiently requires lots of water, large fields and mechanisation—in other words, Iowa or Saskatchewan rather than Oaxaca. Subsidies have caused Mexican farmers to stick to maize instead of switching to more profitable and labour-intensive crops, such as fruit and vegetables, Mr Serra argues. Alberto Cárdenas, the minister of agriculture, says he is trying to streamline and simplify the subsidy system, and direct more of the money to poorer farmers. Others are sceptical that this is happening. </p>
<p>Advocates for subsistence farmers claim that Grupo Maseca, a big tortilla maker, controls 85% of the market for maize flour. “We are not against markets, we are against monopolies,” says Victor Suárez, one of the organisers of the protest. Mr Cárdenas says that the maize market is competitive, but other officials express worries about market concentration. </p>
<p>Fortunately for the government, the tariffs have been removed while prices are at record levels. With maize at $5 a bushel, thanks to a (subsidised) boom in its use to make ethanol in the United States, even the least efficient subsistence farmer can make money. Open markets benefit the millions of poor Mexicans who are not farmers but consume lots of maize. But few of them seem to realise this.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article simply ends, which I found jarring.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;the Department of Defense’s (DOD) management of its major weapon system acquisitions—an area that has been on GAO’s high risk list since 1990. Prior to and since that time, Congress and DOD have continually explored ways to improve acquisition outcomes without much to show for their efforts. DOD’s major weapon system programs continue to take longer, cost more, and deliver fewer quantities and capabilities than originally planned. Current operational demands have highlighted the impact of these persistent problems as DOD has been forced to work outside of its traditional acquisition process to acquire equipment that meet warfighter needs.<br />Investment in weapons acquisition programs is now at its highest level in two decades. The department expects to invest about $900 billion (fiscal year 2008 dollars) over the next 5 years on development and procurement with more than $335 billion invested specifically in major defense acquisition programs. Given the size of this investment, poor outcomes in DOD’s weapon system programs reverberate across the entire federal government. Every dollar wasted during the development and acquisition of weapon systems is money not available for other internal and external budget prioritiries&#8230;</p>

<p>Highlights of GAO-08-782T, a testimony before the Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate<br />Since 1990, GAO has designated the Department of Defense’s (DOD) management of major weapon system acquisitions a high risk area. DOD has taken some action to improve acquisition outcomes, but its weapon programs continue to take longer, cost more, and deliver fewer capabilities than originally planned. These persistent problems—coupled with current operational demands—have impelled DOD to work outside of its traditional acquisition process to acquire equipment that meet urgent warfighter needs.<br />Poor outcomes in DOD’s weapon system programs reverberate across the entire federal government. Over the next 5 years, DOD plans to invest about $900 billion to develop and procure weapon systems—the highest level of investment in two decades. Every dollar wasted on acquiring weapon systems is less money available for other priorities.</p>
<p>This testimony describes DOD’s current weapon system investment portfolio, the problems that contribute to cost and schedule increases, and the potential impacts of recent legislative initiatives and DOD actions aimed at improving outcomes. It also provides some observations about what is needed for DOD to achieve lasting reform. The testimony is drawn from GAO’s body of work on DOD’s acquisition, requirements, and funding processes, as well as its most recent annual assessment of selected DOD weapon programs.<br />DOD’s portfolio of weapon system programs has grown at a pace that far exceeds available resources. From 1992 to 2007, the estimated acquisition costs remaining for major weapons programs increased almost 120 percent, while the annual funding provided for these programs only increased 57 percent. Current programs are experiencing, on average, a 21-month delay in delivering initial capabilities to the warfighter—often forcing DOD to spend additional funds on maintaining legacy systems.<br />Systemic problems both at the strategic and at the program level underlie cost growth and schedule delays. At the strategic level, DOD’s processes for identifying warfighter needs, allocating resources, and developing and procuring weapon systems—which together define DOD’s overall weapon system investment strategy—are fragmented and broken. At the program level, weapon system programs are initiated without sufficient knowledge about system requirements, technology, and design maturity. Lacking such knowledge, managers rely on assumptions that are consistently too optimistic, exposing programs to significant and unnecessary risks and ultimately cost growth and schedule delays. At the same time, frequent turnover of program managers and an increased reliance on contractors increases the government’s risk of losing accountability.</p>

                                <p>By: Divorced one like Bush<br />Update: Link for Import Certificates fixed</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://www.trade-wars.blogspot.com/">Howard Richman&#8217;s</a> blog comes this by idea by Buffet: <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1053684/posts">Import Certificates</a>.  You have to read down a ways before he gets to the idea.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We would achieve this balance by issuing what I will call Import Certificates (ICs) to all U.S. exporters in an amount equal to the dollar value of their exports. Each exporter would, in turn, sell the ICs to parties &#8212; either exporters abroad or importers here &#8212; wanting to get goods into the U.S. To import $1 million of goods, for example, an importer would need ICs that were the byproduct of $1 million of exports. The inevitable result: trade balance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Carbon Cap anyone?  Think Walmart is on the side of this plan?  First of all, what is it with this new approach of solving our externalities via the development of an entirely new market.  Have we not had enough with Milken&#8217;s Junk bonds, Secure sub prime mortgages, greenmail, etc? Is the creation of new trading cards of stated value the equivalent of polishing a rock and creating a wanted jewel?  Maybe so for a “service economy” that makes money from money.  You know&#8230; have a hammer, everything is a nail. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m intrigued by this Import Certificate thing. (But then, I&#8217;m intrigued by the <a href="http://www.apttax.com/index.htm">APT tax </a>concept.)Seems to capture the benefits of a tariff without having to actually choose (be responsible for the decision).  Now that&#8217;s American! </p>
<p>How are they to be valued initially?  Is this approach to solving problems that are the result of using money to smooth the relationships of people not just another form of printing money by the government?  I realize bartering can not take us everywhere we would like to go with our social development, but is this concept just throwing money at the problem?</p>
<p>Buffet notes negative issues.  One, a rise in cost to the US consumer. I have a few concerns that piggy back on his. </p>
<p>Like: 1. The certificates being traded on the open market, and the resultant speculation pricing?<br />2. What would assure that the certificate values do not become the enabler of American junk? Like the US auto industry was back in the 70&#8217;s.<br />3.  What protects the consumer from the ability of a US company to gain all the benefit of improved exporting?  Are we to just assume that the increase in world demand for our products will increase the demand for labor such that pay for labor will rise?  Didn&#8217;t happen early on in our history. It took the bloodied rise of unions to force it.<br />4. What is to stop a company from setting up shell corps in the US, do some fancy booking and benefit from exporting to its self?  Kind of like the transfer payments for tax evasion.  Can you say Corporate Welfare?<br />5. Can this work in a global trade system that has let a new virtual nation come into existance: The United Corporations of Global.  Does not a nation actually have to have possession of it&#8217;s corporations for such to work for the benefit of the nation?</p>
<p>Frankly, I think some of these issue will be issues of the Carbon Cap and trade approach also.  They are approaches that address an externality, a single issue solution, but continue to fail to address the most inclusive of issue for all of us (citizens of the world): monetarily benefiting from trade such that our lives are freer to pursue life, liberty and happiness.  To steal a line: Show me the money.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>It&#8217;s amazing how any discussion of the minimum wage brings out all kinds of discussion and comments.</p>
<p>We have a school of thought that believes very strongly that increases in the minimum wage causes firms to fire minimum wage workers, so higher minimum wages harm the very people it is designed to help.</p>
<p>I am a reasonable man, and understand the theory very well.  But my problem is that I&#8217;m a semi-retired business economist &#8212; one that does not forecast  &#8211;and for my entire career I have been driven by what the data says.   But the data does not support the theory that increasing the minimum wage leads to a decline in minimum wage employment.</p>
<p>Contrary to what a lot of people seem to believe the Bureau of Labor Statistics does publish data on  the number of minimum wage employees.  It is only available on an annual basis and it is not all at one location.  You have to dig it out. But here is where you can start:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dol.gov/search/Search.aspx?search_term=EMPLOYMENT+AT+OR+BELOW+MINIMUM+WAGE&#038;offset=0&#038;submit1.x=13&#038;submit">The data</a>starts in 1979 and this chart compares minimum wage employment to the minimum wage since 1979.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SE1h-cT5DDI/AAAAAAAAAR0/fkTshE5Wqrs/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SE1h-cT5DDI/AAAAAAAAAR0/fkTshE5Wqrs/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Since 1979 their have four periods when the minimum wage was increased.<br />The following table shows what happened.</p>
<p>The way to read the table is that from 1979 to 1981 the minimum wage was raised from $2.90 to $3.35.  That was a 15.5% increase and over this period minimum wage employment rose 13.2% while total wage and salary employment rose 1.1%.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SE1iHHpGbkI/AAAAAAAAAR8/9uMKl7AlBSg/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SE1iHHpGbkI/AAAAAAAAAR8/9uMKl7AlBSg/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>We have four examples of minimum wage increases and the average increase was 14.7%. At the same time the average increase in minimum wage employment was 22.2% versus a 2.1% gain in total wage and salary employment.</p>
<p>Part of the gain in minimum wage employment is due to wage compression at the bottom.  When the minimum wage is increased from $5.50, for example to $6.00 it is not only the people who were earnings $5.50 that receive a wage increase.  The people earning between $5.50 and $6.00 will also have their wage increased to at least $6.00.  Moreover, some people earning $6.00 will not get a pay raise.  So when the minimum wage was $5.50 minimum wage employment consisted of those earnings $5.50.  But when it is $6.00 some people that were earning more then  $5.50 will now be added to the number of minimum wage workers earning $6.00.</p>
<p>I have no idea how much of the 22.2% average gain in minimum wage employment was due to wage compression.  I&#8217;ve tried to work some different scenarios  and concluded it probably was not the dominant factor.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of any papers that have calculated how significant this wage compression is?</p>
<p>But here is my bottom line.  I see this great theory that minimum wage increases cause minimum wage workers to lose their jobs.  But I look at the data on minimum wage employment and it tells me that the theory can not be right.</p>
<p>Ok, Mark Perry, Don Boudreaux or any of the others teaching their students that minimum wage increases cause minimum wage workers to lose their jobs, can you explain to me why I should reject this data and accept your theory.</p>
