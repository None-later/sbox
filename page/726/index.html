                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Three guesses as to who wrote <a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/keynes/john_maynard/k44g">The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</a>. OK, most of you got that it was John Maynard Keynes on your first guess.</p>
<p>So why ask such a silly question? <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/watching_conservatives_/2008/01/was_the_founder_of_fascism_a_fascist.php">Mark Kleiman</a> provides a clue as he points us to <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/01/13/jonah-goldbergs-revisionist-definitions">Nicole Belle</a> who notes Goldberg claimed:</p>
<blockquote><p>To sort of start the story, the reason why we see fascism as a thing of the right is because fascism was originally a form of right-wing socialism. Mussolini was born a socialist, he died a socialist, he never abandoned his love of socialism, he was one of the most important socialist intellectuals in Europe and was one of the most important socialist activists in Italy, and the only reason he got dubbed a fascist and therefore a right-winger is because he supported World War I.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nicole, however, reminds us:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Mussolini was dubbed a fascist because he founded the Fascist Party.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Mark notes:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Is there absolutely no limit on how clueless and intellectually dishonest you can be while still remaining a respected &#8220;conservative&#8221; commentator, in the current, debased sense of the word &#8220;conservative&#8221;? Guess not.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then again – Jonah’s rightwing economic know nothing friends often declare the General Theory to be one of the ten most evil books of all times even though none of them likely bothered to read it.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/14/opinion/14krugman.html?ex=1357966800&#038;en=4f4a13fb46e57128&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink">Paul Krugman</a> asks reporters to examine what each of the main Presidential candidates propose to do about what appears to be a weakening economy. It should not be any surprise that he does not have kind things to say about the nonsense coming from the GOP debates but he does have a few good things to say about two of the three leading Democrats. But it was this that caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Obama campaign’s initial response to the latest wave of bad economic news was, I’m sorry to say, disreputable: Mr. Obama’s top economic adviser claimed that the long-term tax-cut plan the candidate announced months ago is just what we need to keep the slump from “morphing into a drastic decline in consumer spending.” Hmm: claiming that the candidate is all-seeing, and that a tax cut originally proposed for other reasons is also a recession-fighting measure &#8211; doesn’t that sound familiar?</p></blockquote>
<p>If not, read <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2002/08/08/news/economy/bush_forum/index.htm">this</a> and let’s discuss:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bush and Cheney have said that the tax cut was perfectly timed to help the economy return to growth after three straight quarters of contraction in 2001. In fact, Bush has asked for the tax cut, which expires in 10 years, to be made permanent to fuel future economic growth. But Democrats and other critics have noted that the tax cut, which in part benefited higher-income taxpayers, helped wipe out a federal budget surplus carefully crafted during the Clinton administration, possibly threatening the economy&#8217;s future health. &#8220;It was a very difficult and very important achievement to get a balanced budget and a budget surplus, which Clinton did,&#8221; said Roger Altman, a deputy treasury secretary under Clinton and founder of Evercore Partners in Washington. &#8220;In the blink of an eye, that fiscal discipline &#8211; which in turn permitted monetary policy to be stimulative and gave confidence to investors and businesses, and had a role in the economic performance of the United States in the late 1990s &#8211; has been dropped.&#8221; &#8220;The prospect of a $165 billion budget deficit is a very negative development that is undermining business and investor confidence,&#8221; Altman added. Other critics are alarmed by the Bush administration&#8217;s apparent refusal to bend from certain pet ideas &#8211; the tax cut was presented in 1999 as the only logical response to the boom and was re-packaged in 2001 as the only logical response to the doldrums. &#8220;They came in a year and a half ago with a set of preconceived notions, and nothing, no event, no conceivable event, seems to get them to modify any aspect of that,&#8221; said William Gale, senior fellow for economic studies at the Brookings Institution.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lawrence Lindsey once told Tim Russert that the “economics profession” had declared his 1999 tax cut proposal to be one that we perfectly timed. It would seem that it was Dr. Lindsey who made this claim so I guess he considers himself to be the entire profession. But it is true that he and George W. Bush designed their set of back-loaded giveaways for the rich during a period when the economy was booming. If Dr. Lindsey was forecasting the 2001 recession two years in advance, maybe he should have published his most insightful forecast. As far as how this was designed, it certainly failed the targeted and temporary principles that we have <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/01/douglas-elmendorf-and-jason-furman-on.html">recently</a> heard much about.</p>
<p>For Senator Obama to be playing this supposed omniscient game with a tax cut that was not perfectly designed to combat a recession strikes me as rather bad politics if one wishes to capture the Democratic nomination. After all – we should leave the praising of past GOP Administrations to those clowns who think the road map to the White House starts at the alter of Saint Ronald.</p>

                                <p>Go figure – the National Review is on the tax cut bandwagon again. <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTQyODBlYzAyM2M2ZTYwY2NjMzhkNGYxZjZjNzE4OTY">Lawrence Kudlow</a> provides a summary of all the GOP Presidential candidate’s ideas but he offers no analysis beyond calling the Huckabee Flat Tax “flawed” and tossing words like “gonzo” around as if such terms carried some deep economic meaning. OK, Kudlow has decided to criticize President Bush for turning to the Keynesian dark side. But we have to turn to <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MGRjYjZiYmQyMzcyYmFjMWFlZDAwY2VkZjgxOGQzOWI=">Thomas Nugent</a> to see what the NRO nitwits are really thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea is that a lower fed funds rate will free the economy from weakness by encouraging borrowing and spending. But the pundits seem to forget just what led the U.S. out of its most recent downturn, the Y2K-induced mini-recession of 2001. President Bush and his advisors saw the need for immediate fiscal stimulus, and they pushed through a tax-cut package that at least neutralized the downturn. Unfortunately, since there were not enough incentives built into that tax cut, financial markets were unimpressed and the bear market extended into 2002.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm? It was that “perfectly timed” 2001 tax cut that saved the day! Or was it as Nugent admits that the recovery was really weak until late 2003. But then Nugent claims it was those 2003 reductions in dividend tax rates that led to the recovery. Increases in defense spending, business investment finally unwinding its overhang from the investment led recession and responding to falling long-term rates, and rising exports from dollar devaluation were all irrelevant I guess. What passes for economic commentary over at the National Review gets sillier and sillier.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">This source</a>, which one of our rightwing trolls says does not exist, shows that real defense spending increased by 7.4% in 2002, 8.7% in 2003, and 5.8% in 2004.  The biggest jump came in the second quarter of 2003.  But our rightwing troll says this had nothing to do with the fact the real GDP growth finally took off in 2003.  Yep – rightwing trolls get to call those of us who live in the real world liars as facts really do not exist in their world.  Go figure.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Now that violence in Iraq is down to levels that were unacceptable a few years ago, there&#8217;s been much chest-pounding from certain quarters.  But let&#8217;s assume that magically, by the end of this day, all violence in Iraq ceases, and within weeks all those who fled their homes &#8211; either leaving the country or at least their neighborhood &#8211; return.  Let&#8217;s further assume that all is quiet from here on out, at least for the next 100 years.  Let us assume an oil sharing law is achieved and all parties stick to it.  These last two assumptions in turn generate a third&#8230;  there is a reasonably strong central government as opposed to the collection of fiefdoms we&#8217;ve managed to establish in Afghanistan.  And let&#8217;s further assume that government is democratic, and is run honestly.  Finally, let us even assume it becomes a beacon for democracy in the region, whatever the heck that means.</p>
<p>Assume all of that&#8230; what then, will the US have achieved by invading Iraq?</p>
<p>Presumably, the government will be mostly pro-Iranian&#8230; Iraq is 60% Shia, after all, and it shares a border with Iran.  That doesn&#8217;t mean annexation by Iran, but it does mean they&#8217;ll view their interests as being generally more aligned with Iran than with the US.</p>
<p>Iraqi society might also resemble Iran to a degree somewhat greater than Americans would be comfortable with.  Women in a lot of Sunni and Shia areas know the consequences to not, um, dressing modestly.  This is also true of women in the other country in the region the US has liberated &#8211; Afghanistan. </p>
<p>Which leads to another point&#8230;  as I said earlier, let us assume Iraq becomes the beacon of democracy for the region.  But&#8230; couldn&#8217;t the same thing have been accomplished in Afghanistan at much lower cost?  Perhaps we didn&#8217;t have the half a million troops needed to do things right in Iraq from the beginning, but clearly (look at the Surge) we could have put an additional 160,000 troops in Afghanistan for a year &#8211; wouldn&#8217;t that have made Afghanistan into a more stable place by now?  A beacon of democracy perhaps instead of an ongoing war?  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a demonstration that the US won&#8217;t be intimidated by Al Qaeda.  Fine&#8230;  that too could have been better demonstrated in Afghanistan.  (Its not like Al Qaeda was in Iraq when Saddam was around.)  </p>
<p>Then there are the military bases &#8211; presumably they can be used to project force in the region.  But against who, and how much?  Are the Iranians really going to worry that the US might invade, given the costs that we incurred in invading a much weaker Iraq, and an infinitesimally weaker Afghanistan?  If the US had gone into Afghanistan and done it right &#8211; produced the peaceful democracy that GW talks about quickly and efficiently &#8211; maybe it would be enough to scare Iran.  But best case scenario, what&#8217;s it going to do?</p>
<p>Maybe control of oil?  With best case scenario piled on best case scenario, presumably Iraq makes long term oil deals with big American companies&#8230; Exxon and the rest of &#8217;em.  Not that this necessarily benefits the average American anyway, but the US has a long of history of intervening in foreign countries on the behalf of its large companies.  (Just ask anyone in Central America.)  Nevertheless, what little benefit there is to most Americans of that becomes a less of a benefit when you consider that the government <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/repressive-governments-can-own-us.html">doesn&#8217;t care</a> if American companies are owned by despotic foreign regimes.  So making Iraq safe for Exxon only means making Iraq safe for whoever owns the majority shares of Exxon, and if that happens to be the Chinese or Saudi governments, so be it.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the benefit to the Iraqi people.  On the plus side, Saddam&#8217;s regime is gone, on the minus, certain societal mores &#8211; fundamentalist mores, in particular &#8211; will have to be observed.  A trivial issue, perhaps, to those who would observe those mores anyway, but not so trivial to those who would prefer to live in a less theocratic environment.  And the US will be remembered &#8211; in Iraq and elsewhere in the region &#8211;  as having helped that society.</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;  that&#8217;s the best case scenario I see in Iraq, and what we will get from it.  Agree?  Disagree?</p>

<p>
<blockquote>You know, you have environmental groups giving out kits and instructions about how to have environmentally conscious sex. You don&#8217;t have conservative groups talking about what kind of condoms you should use or what positions you can be in. That kind of thing doesn&#8217;t really go on.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think Goldberg is against thinks like sodomy laws and he says he’s a conservative. By his logic, no conservative has ever advocated restricting the use of condoms or what positions one might take with a willing partner. But his “logic” does not square with historical reality. But then I guess Mr. Goldberg has never bothered to check reality before uttering such a statement.</p>
<p>But pray tell – what is environmentally conscious sex? I’m a liberal and I don’t going away passing out such kits and instructions. Does anyone know what Mr. Goldberg is babbling about here?</p>

<p>”Hanky Panky?”</p>
<p>In Africa the chiefs and top political leaders of countries are know as the “ Big Man. ”  At Goldman Sachs, Henry “Hank” Paulson was the Big Man until getting the Treasury top post.  During the meeting of the Financial Stabilization Committee last Friday at the White House, did Big Man Hank talk to Big Man Ben of the Fed?  Were some trenchant phone calls made after the meeting to set up what looks like a crazy investment deal by a private bank?  Color me suspicious.</p>
<p>Bank of America (ticker BAC) bought a big stake in Countrywide mortgage company (ticker CFC) at $18-$20 a share and is already way down on it&#8217;s initial investment.  Now they come to market and buy the rest of Countrywide for $7 a share after rumors that Countrywide was going bankrupt.  Bank of America’s spokesman said they’d studied the deal from all angles using due diligence.  They are now doubling up on a big losing bet. Barry Ritholz over at the Big Picture made <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/01/boa-in-talks-to.html">this observation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4oGsNumL7I/AAAAAAAAA88/x2NjONwOQww/s1600-h/oldvet+-+countrywide,+big+picture.gif"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4oGsNumL7I/AAAAAAAAA88/x2NjONwOQww/s320/oldvet+-+countrywide,+big+picture.gif" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a scenario.</p>
<p>1. BoA or its new unit Countrywide borrows funds from Fed short term and pledges worthless securitized assets or mortgages as collateral; or does so anonymously during TAF auctions that Fed has set up to pump cash into commercial paper markets.  (The Fed has recently started taking mortgage backed securities as collateral.)</p>
<p>2. BoA doesn&#8217;t pay back its loans to Fed.</p>
<p>3. Fed writes off the mortgage paper losses and the loans.  BoA gets a tax break for assets basis in excess of loans received, if any.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s enough incentive, I think, for Bank of America’s seat at the table as a Primary Dealer, one of some 21 banks authorized to borrow directly from the Fed.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This one was by OldVet.  </p>
<p>Cactus here&#8230;  there is another possibility&#8230; BofA is suffering from stupidity.  We&#8217;ve seen a number of big players &#8211; Countrywide, Citi, Bear Stearns, and other less well-known names &#8211;  get hosed here, for failing to foresee the validity of Stein&#8217;s Law (&#8220;if something cannot go on forever, it won&#8217;t&#8221;).  Why assume it stopped?</p>

                                <p>My hunt for Obama&#8217;s econ advisor lead me to a paper that incorporates a review of a book: Does Atlas Shrug? The Economic Consequences of Taxing the Rich. It caught my attention because the paper is written by a tax lawyer.: Reuven S. Avi-Yonah, the Irwin I. Cohn Professor of Law and director of the International Tax LL.M. Program&#8230; He also served as consultant to the U.S. Treasury on tax competition and OECD on tax competition, and is a member of the Steering Group of the OECD&#8217;s International Network for Tax Research and chair of the American Bar Association&#8217;s Tax Section Committee on Consumption Taxes.</p>
<p>I never really thought about it, but laws are the means by which we create taxation. They do reflect our reasoning. So, maybe we need to consider law arguments as we discuss taxes?</p>
<p>This will be presented in multiple parts in order to not hog the blog space here (or bore those not interested).  My intent in presenting this review is to move the question of taxation beyond the simple rhetoric. We are at a time that is being implied will be a mark on our historical time line of national personality; the coming presidential election.  For the best of our personality to come through, we need more than focus group tested conversation about money.  We need to do the work to not only understand the physics of money but, also the philosophies of money. We have experienced 3 distinct approaches: pre-income tax, New Deal and Reaganomics.  Time we start being responsible for the decisions made and look at what we decided, how we justified them and what those decisions gave us. Now is the time to ask: Just what the hell was I thinking here?</p>
<p>The paper is actually a discussion by Mr. Avi-Yonah that uses a review of <em>Does Atlas Shurg</em> for his lead in to his title: <em><a href="http://www.yalelawjournal.org/111/6/1391_reuven_s_avi-yonah.html">Why Tax the Rich? Efficiency, Equity, and Progressive Taxation.</a></em>   We here at AB have tossed around the short answer “because the richer you are the more benefit you get”.   Mr. Avi-Yonah sets up his paper&#8217;s question:<br />
<blockquote>“Thus, the question of whether high marginal tax rates come with an unaffordably high cost to the U.S. economy remains unsettled. Does Atlas Shrug?,&#8230;attempts to answer this question. </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Part I begins with an excellent historical survey by W. Elliot Brownlee of the rates facing the rich from the beginning of the U.S. income tax in 1913 to the present.  He indicates that effective rates during the high marginal rate years of World War I reached 15.8%, and that during the high marginal rate years of World War II they reached an astonishing 58.6% in 1944.  After the war, while the top marginal rate remained extremely high at 91%, the effective rate for the rich declined to 32.2% in 1952, then 24.6% in 1963, rising to 28.9% when Ronald Reagan took office and declining to 22.1% following the 1986 tax reductions. The conclusion drawn by Brownlee is that the rich can be taxed at very high effective rates during times of national emergency, but that at other times their political clout ensures that effective rates are much lower than marginal rates.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, guess we don&#8217;t need to worry about the nominal rates, they mean squat. But the question; do high rates cost us? The summary answer:<br />
<blockquote>“In general, they provide a mixed answer&#8230; While there is some evidence of behavioral responses, it is quite limited and seems to depend crucially on the authors’ chosen methodology. Importantly, most of the findings of behavioral response relate to the use of various tax avoidance techniques—and even there the evidence is mixed, with some obvious techniques being used less than they should be in a world in which tax minimization is very important to the rich. <strong> Real behaviors, such as labor and saving, seem much less affected by taxation.</strong>  This distinction is important because while both tax avoidance techniques and real behavioral changes cause deadweight losses, the former can be partially prevented by changing the law, while the latter are less amenable to legal change since one cannot force the rich to work or save more.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As to the evidence, Mr. Avi-Yonah states that the 9 studies are reported in 3 groups. The first being limitations of past research such as noted by<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/austan-goolsbee-obamas-econ-man.html"> Goolsbee</a>.   The second group:<br />
<blockquote>“&#8230;support the view that behavioral responses by the rich to taxation are quite limited. A study by Moffitt and Wilhelm investigates the labor supply decisions of the rich based on responses to the 1986 Tax Reform Act and finds essentially <strong>no responsiveness of the hours of work</strong> of high-income men to tax reductions&#8230;But the studies also suggest that high-income men are <strong>unlikely to decrease hours worked as tax rates go up</strong>&#8230;Other studies in this group suggest that even financial behaviors, which are less “ real,” and therefore more likely to be tax-motivated than labor or saving decisions, do not respond much to taxation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He specifically notes evidence that portfolio choices do not significantly change, there is <strong>not</strong> <em>“judicious”</em> sheltering of capital gains and that <em>“inter vivos giving”</em> are <em>“much lower”</em> than would be expected if <em>“households were taking full advantage of this estate tax avoidance technique.”</em></p>
<p>So far, nominal rates mean squat and the rich don&#8217;t really play the tax rate game as has been implied by those offering tax rates as an excuse for our sorry condition. But, they do play:<br />
<blockquote>“The third and final group is made up of studies that do find some behavioral responses to taxation. For example, Auten, Clotfelter, and Schmalbeck find that the current tax system does stimulate some charitable giving by the wealthy, compared with a system in which contributions are not deductible, but that the sensitivity of giving to tax changes is smaller than suggested by previous researchers. They also find that current law does encourage the wealthy to engage in elaborate estate tax arrangements associated with their charitable donations. Alm and Wallace examine a wide range of taxpayer reporting decisions by the rich in the wake of tax law changes and suggest that they show increased responsiveness due to their larger control over the form of their compensation. Finally, Carroll, Holtz-Eakin, Rider, and Rosen investigate the behavior of entrepreneurs in response to tax rate increases and conclude that individual income taxes do have a large negative effect (a five percent increase in marginal tax rates decreases mean capital expenditures by approximately ten percent).”</p></blockquote>
<p>My theory on this last info, they like to make sure they settle their conscience in the end but only if they get a break and if they earned it with their own business they will sacrifice the business to keep up the income.<br />
<blockquote>“I would also add that most of the evidence for behavioral responses in the book relates to tax avoidance strategies (e.g., charitable giving techniques, shifting income from corporations to individuals, and the timing of receipts), rather than to real activities (labor and saving decisions).”</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Avi-Yonah closes this part of his argument noting that the book did not address the issue of illegal tax avoidance:<br />
<blockquote>“Slemrod is not to be blamed for not focusing on this issue because no recent data exist, but it is high time for Congress to study the question of illegal tax evasion by Americans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if the nominal rates don&#8217;t matter as the tax code is currently set up and the rich don&#8217;t respond to higher rates by working less or lower rates by working more and they will cheat the game to the benefit of them self, then the question of &#8220;why&#8221; and &#8220;how much&#8221; tax needs a reasoned answer verses a mechanized answer.  We have to justify our taxing with words and use the research to tell us if our reasoning is getting us to our goal. We have to accept that money is and does as we say it is and will do.  It is the entity created in our own image.  It is a medium of personal creative expression.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#ambig_assertion">This blog</a> seemed to provide a comprehensive list of technique. The following caught my eye of a couple hundred tacks. Live and learn. I am following CoRev&#8217;s lead that flamers are not trolls.</p>
<p>
<blockquote><em>Short Term Versus Long Term</em>:<br />this is a particular case of the <a href="http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#middle">Excluded Middle</a>. For example, &#8220;We must deal with crime on the streets before improving the schools.&#8221; (But why can&#8217;t we do some of both?) Similarly, &#8220;We should take the scientific research budget and use it to feed starving children.&#8221; <a name="burden"></a><br /><em>Burden Of Proof</em>:<br />the claim that whatever has not yet been proved false must be true (or vice versa). Essentially the arguer claims that he should win by default if his opponent can&#8217;t make a strong enough case.<br />There may be three problems here. First, the arguer claims priority, but can he back up that claim? Second, he is impatient with ambiguity, and wants a final answer right away. And third, &#8220;absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&#8221; <a name="question"></a><br /><em>Argument By Question</em>:<br />asking your opponent a question which does not have a snappy answer. (Or anyway, no snappy answer that the audience has the background to understand.) Your opponent has a choice: he can look weak or he can look long-winded. For example, &#8220;How can scientists expect us to believe that anything as complex as a single living cell could have arisen as a result of random natural processes?&#8221;<br />Actually, pretty well any question has this effect to some extent. It usually takes longer to answer a question than ask it. </p></blockquote>

Atrios also reminds us&#8230; after 9/11, Rudy Giuliani turned down a donation of $10 million from Alwaleed bin Talal after the latter made statements that seemed to suggest American policies toward the Middle East inadvertently led to the attack.</p>
<p>Its been pointed out by others, but I&#8217;d like to ask again&#8230; one of the justifications against the Federal government running a surplus (and therefore, one of the justifications put forward by the Fed for justifying GW&#8217;s tax cuts) is that if that happens, eventually the US government ends up owning securities like stocks.  Why is it such a bad thing the US government, that at least theoretically acts in our best interests, owns a piece of Citibank, but not a problem, and perhaps even commendable that repressive regimes own a piece of Citibank?</p>
