<p>In one of the biggest changes to Wall Street in decades,<br />Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the last two independent<br />investment banks, will become bank holding companies, the<br />Federal Reserve said Sunday night.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/">RGE Monitor</a> carries a lot of analysis such as it is.  I am going to ask people at work if they have followed or noticed any of the news on this business&#8230;and their understandings.  A couple posts worth I hope.</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/bailout-plan-oops-get-out-big-checkbook.html">The draft proposal</a> is reviewed and linked on stormy&#8217;s post and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/solidary-pt-2.html">Tom&#8217;s post Solidarity Pt. 2</a>.

<blockquote><p>Following the lead of his buddy, and probable Secretary of the Treasury, Phil Gramm, McCain has been a vehement deregulator. Here is the deathless quote: &#8220;Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>State capitalism is brought to you by neo-con Republicans and docile Democrats.  We have recieved maybe a few hundred to a couple thousand in rebates, borrowed from us, and have just been billed seven thousand or so a person for this current catastrophe.</p>
<p>Check your savings or retirement account and subtract a bit over $7,000.  If you do not blink, do you still want to vote for the people who brought you government ownership of financial companies?  Secretary of the Treasury Phil Gramm?</p>
<p>[Show of hands of all those who want Phil Gramm to have unfettered, uncontested use of that $700B for 20 months?? &#8211; klh]</p>

                                <p>CNN does some he-said, she-said, but <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/21/news/economy/bailout_proposal_Sunday/index.htm">throws in some data</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The administration&#8217;s proposal also requests that Congress authorize an increase to the nation&#8217;s debt ceiling. Currently, it&#8217;s set to rise to $10.6 trillion for fiscal year 2009 &#8211; which runs from October 2008 through September 2009. But the proposal requests that limit be increased to $11.315 trillion to allow for the purchases of mortgage-backed assets. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, strangely, I have always heard that assets have a positive value.  When I buy $100 worth of a stock—say, PWND—my Net Asset Value doesn&#8217;t change.  The same should be true of buying a MBS worth $0.30 on the dollar.</p>
<p>So why would we need to increase the deficit ceiling by $700,000,000,000 if we&#8217;re buying assets worth $700,000,000,000?</p>
<p>The only reasonable conclusion is that we plan to pay $700,000,000,000 <strong><em>above market</em></strong> for the securities.  No wonder it has to be &#8220;clean and quick.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>Henry Paulson promises that he will spend the 700,000,000,000 of our dollars over which he wants total control wisely.  I say he be required to put his money where his mouth is.  Ask him how much he expects them to be worth after he has spent them on mortgage backed assets and tell him he pays 1/1,000 th of losses beyond that up to 10 million (he has them) and gets 1/1,000 th of all profits (that is if we end up with more than $ 700 billion he keeps one one thousandth of the difference.</p>
<p>He would get even paler if his money were on the line.</p>
<p>Also, I think if any firm sells stuff to the treasury, the officers of that firm should be required to put up 1% of the money and get 1% of the revenue generated by the assets their firm sold and 1% of proceeds from sale of those assets.</p>
<p>That way, if they are good stewards of their shareholders wealth, they will still dump their worst junk on the treasury (and pigs will fly). Otherwise they will try to unload at fair value (if they make a profit they get sued.  If they make a loss for the treasury they hurt their pocket books).  </p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The &#8220;Draft Proposal for Bailout Plan&#8221; is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21draftcnd.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">now available.</a> What to make of it? Well, it certainly is sweeping and simplistic. I have two complaints. The first complaint is that it gives to one individual enormous, unchecked power. My second complaint is that the very individuals we now must trust have in part led us into this impasse. They are the ones who should have acted sooner, the ones who should have sounded the alert much, much earlier.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are now left with few, if any, options. Nonetheless, I will register my complaints&#8230;and my anger.</p>
<p>With the only restriction that the financial institution be headquartered in the U.S. or any of its territories, Secretary Paulson now has carte blanche to purchase and then sell any mortgage related asset. No law can check him; no law governs him. He is restricted only by Title 5, Section 3109 of the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t05t08+207+0++()%20%20AN">United States Code</a>, which means he can hire temporary help for a period not to exceed one year.</p>
<blockquote><p>Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clear the books. Clean the slate. Put on your best smile. The former CEO of Goldman Sachs is coming to the rescue.  He cannot be held accountable to any law. His word is final and absolute. We have given him a very, very big checkbook.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs? That was one going to be one of the dominoes slated to fall, was it not? Has the fox entered the hen house and can now have his way with all the chickens? Does he deserve our trust? Has he earned it?</p>
<p>Many hands brought us here, including Congressional ones, as our shadow banking system became less regulated, as restrictions were removed for what banks could and could not do. Nonetheless, those who are <i>now</i> charged with our financial system&#8217;s safe keeping were asleep at the wheel, drunk perhaps, from the party that has raged through the latter half of this decade. They should have seen the cliff over which we now have plunged, but they did not.</p>
<p>Blame Congress or blame Greenspan if you want. Bernanke has had almost three years at the helm; Paulson has had two plus years. Both men were expected to understand the issues when they accepted their responsibilities. They were obliged to tell us honestly and truthfully. If Congress had made mistakes or if Greenspan had failed, they should have told us&#8230;pointedly, frankly. To do less was a dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>And what have we witnessed as this festering, unregulated sore has grown? We have seen the application of larger and larger band aids. &#8220;More band aids and pray&#8221; seems to have been the Paulson-Bernanke motto. Now, because we have no option, we are forced to place our trust in both of them.</p>
<p>Belief in them is no longer an option; it is an imperative.</p>
<p>History, I suspect, will not share that assessment. This economy has been ill for some time.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, what <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38725-2005Apr8.html">Paul Volker said</a> three years ago, in April of 2005:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet, under the placid surface, there are disturbing trends: huge imbalances, disequilibria, risks &#8212; call them what you will. Altogether the circumstances seem to me as dangerous and intractable as any I can remember, and I can remember quite a lot. What really concerns me is that there seems to be so little willingness or capacity to do much about it&#8230;.A vulnerable financial/banking system. We live in a global laissez faire financial system that is highly leveraged with debt financing, derivatives and fractional reserve banking. Hedge funds are not really “hedged,” but highly speculative, and another collapse along the lines of Long Term Capital Management could be disastrous.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now consider one of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/ask/20080125.html">Henry Paulson&#8217;s band aids</a> in January of 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. economy is fundamentally strong and will continue to grow in the short term. But, growth is slowing down markedly as the housing correction, capital market turbulence and high oil prices are taking their toll. So while I expect our economy to continue growing, the risks are to the downside. Recognizing this, the President decided that the time had come to take steps to protect our economy. He directed me to work with the Congress to enact an economic growth package quickly, to boost economic growth and job creation this year&#8230;. </p>
<p>To have an impact on our economic growth this year, we have to work with the Congress to enact legislation quickly. I have been very engaged with leaders of both parties in Congress, who share our commitment to getting legislation in place that can boost economic growth and job creation this year. I’m glad we reached agreement with the House, but our work isn’t done until this legislation reaches the President’s desk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The economy needed a bit of stimulus. &#8220;Keep moving to the mall, folks.&#8221; Was this a political decision in an election year?</p>
<p>In December of 2007, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/ask/20080125.html">Paulson was somewhat aware</a> of the sub prime problem, but where was his focus?</p>
<blockquote><p>Mortgage market financial innovation has benefited the U.S. economy and U.S. homeowners; it has also introduced some of the challenges we face today. <i>Financial innovation led to the creation of mortgage products that put homeownership within the reach of more people.</i> At the same time, innovation also made riskier loans – with no down payments or minimal documentation &#8211; more widely available. Similarly, securitization has brought benefits and challenges &#8211; making more capital available for mortgages, but creating greater market complexity. As a result, we now have an array of different market participants, often with different interests&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even in December of 2007, Paulson had a hard time understanding that unregulated, un-transparent financial innovation was bringing us closer and closer to the precipice. The problem, he thought, might certainly be tidied up because the HOPE NOW Alliance</p>
<blockquote><p>has brought the resources of investors to bear to enable non-profit mortgage counselors to be more widely available</p></blockquote>
<p>We are entering the jaws of the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression and he is talking about &#8220;more non-profit mortgage counselors&#8221;? You have to be kidding&#8211;&#8220;non-profit,&#8221; no less.</p>
<p>And what was <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/bernankebunning11212005.pdf">Bernanke saying in 2005</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Moreover, the agencies have made clear that no bank is too big too fail, so that bank management, shareholders, and uninsured debt holders understand that they will not escape the consequences of excessive risk-taking. In short, although vigilance is necessary, I believe the systemic risk inherent in the banking system is well managed and well controlled.</p></blockquote>
<p>No bank is too big to fail? Hmmmmmmmm.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: These men are supposed to know the terrain, the data. They are not supposed to be surprised. They are not supposed to apply ever-larger band aids and then say, &#8220;Oops&#8230;bring out the hacksaw; we need to do foxhole brain surgery. (The comparison to the Iraq War has not escaped me.)</p>
<p>Does anybody know what he is doing?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/_/2008/09/does_anyone_like_this_deal.php">Jonathan Zasloff at the RBC</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Consensus at last!</p>
<p>Just a brief swing around the blogospheric and journalistic circle reveals that everyone seems to hate the atrocious proposal that the administration has made for taxpayers to write it a blank check.</p>
<p>Krugman, Mallaby, Marshall, Bainbridge, Baker, Manzi, and RBC all hate the thing.</p>
<p>This, of course, strongly suggests that the Democrats will cave. If they do, Senator Obama, the ball is in your court.</p></blockquote>
<p>Heh indeedy.</p>
<p>FWIW, I hate it too.  My bias, also FWIW, is to prefer sucking up one&#8217;s principles as to how an economy should be run and extending a safety net rather than allowing key elements of it to fail and going along for the resulting ride.  Pace Ken from earlier, whatever risk there may be from going along with some sort of bailout, there&#8217;s also a risk from sticking to &#8220;principles&#8221; such as they may be.</p>
<p>Based on the <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/09/bailout-proposal.html">leaked draft of the proposal from the administration</a>, what we have is not only (or not just) a massive fund to bail out &#8216;too big&#8217; (or &#8216;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EconomistsView/~3/396634238/connectedness.html">too interconnected</a>&#8216;) to fail institutions for which quick action may be needed, but rather authorization for authorization for mortgage market interventions anywhere the Secretary of the Treasury sees fit.  However necessary some additional interventions may turn out to be in the end, not every mortgage-related loss in the financial system requires urgent action by Congress with such blank-check terms.</p>
<p>Here are a few notable features.  First, the  broad grant of authority:<br />
<blockquote>(a) Authority to Purchase.&#8211;The Secretary is authorized to purchase, and to make and fund commitments to purchase, on such terms and conditions as determined by the Secretary, mortgage-related assets from any financial institution having its headquarters in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the essence of the blank check — the purchases would be &#8220;on such terms and conditions as determined by the Secretary&#8221; and SecTreas is empowered to purchase &#8220;mortgage-related assets&#8221; from &#8220;any&#8221; domestically-domiciled financial institution.&#8221;  &#8220;On such terms&#8221; certainly can cut different ways: it could involve haircuts worthy of Sweeney Todd — but only if that&#8217;s how SecTreas exercises the available discretion.  Authorizing purchases from &#8220;any&#8221; domestically-domiciled financial institution means that the provisions are not limited to institutions posing systemic risks to the integrity of the financial system. (Apparently &#8220;domestic-domiciled&#8221; is now optional, according to the NYT article linked by Ken.)  Interestingly, &#8220;financial institution&#8221; is undefined, so while the NYT reports that Paulson doesn&#8217;t plan to use his authority to purchase hedge fund assets, it doesn&#8217;t seem that there&#8217;s anything in this language to prevent him from changing his mind.  Last, the definition of &#8220;mortgage-related assets,&#8221; apart from being broad enough to apparently extend the Secretary&#8217;s authority to the foulest toxic waste, does at least ensure that they&#8217;ve covered any needed bailing-out related to busts in commercial mortgages.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d like to see here at a minimum would be more specific language requiring Treasury and some other entities (i.e. including but not necessarily limited to the Fed) jointly certify that an action under this title would be in service of avoidance of financial-system failure.  I&#8217;d also like to see a requirement that the terms of any purchase share any upside of the bailout for bailed-out firms with the public.</p>
<p>The features that look like they protect the public interest are weaker than they look:<br />
<blockquote>Sec. 3. Considerations.</p>
<p>In exercising the authorities granted in this Act, the Secretary shall take into consideration means for&#8211;</p>
<p>(1) providing stability or preventing disruption to the financial markets or banking system; and</p>
<p>(2) protecting the taxpayer.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not a lawyer, but as an occupational hazard have had occasion to learn a little about what this construction means. Directing agents to &#8220;take into consideration&#8221; things is not the same as &#8220;requiring&#8221; that they do specific things, not least when the factors to be considered are so vague.  If an action taken under this act includes a statement explaining how those factors were considered, then good luck getting a court to find that discretion was abused.  And if you were inclined otherwise, the belt-and-suspenders provision makes it clear that the intent of the draft legislation is to leave Treasury&#8217;s discretion unfettered:<br />
<blockquote>Sec. 8. Review.</p>
<p>Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.<br /><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/398600429/no-deal.html"></a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/398600429/no-deal.html">Brad DeLong</a> looks at that from the left-of-center position and says hell-no to giving this sort of discretion over $700 billion to Phil Gramm or anyone else who might be on John McCain&#8217;s shortlist for Treasury secretary; I&#8217;d have to wonder to what extent Republicans would want to hand the checkbook to one of the <a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2008/06/obama-economic-advisors-and-economic.html">economists for Obama</a> with so few strings attached.  Reportedly Barney Frank is looking to give the Government Accountability Office audit and other oversight authority, and that would be one useful step towards proper oversight of the program.</p>
<p>Josh Marshall <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Talking-Points-Memo/~3/Z_6zdJjzzTc/218444.php">reports that banking lobbyists are already at work</a> trying to get congressional Republicans to oppose the introduction of ancillary provisions, with giving bankruptcy judges the right to modify loan terms chief among those opposed.  Yet the legislation does give Treasury the right to act as if it owns such mortgage rights as it may buy:<br />
<blockquote>Sec. 5. Rights; Management; Sale of Mortgage-Related Assets.</p>
<p>(a) Exercise of Rights.&#8211;The Secretary may, at any time, exercise any rights received in connection with mortgage-related assets purchased under this Act.</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;considerations&#8221; of draft Section 3 don&#8217;t particularly reach the level of establishing policies for how any such rights should be exercised.  Obviously expanding this section to direct how Treasury exercises those rights is one of the ways the smarter Democrats are looking to improve the legislation.</p>
<p>Last, there&#8217;s what a cynic might consider the final enablement-of-kleptocracy provision, allowing the Secretary to:<br />
<blockquote>[enter] into contracts, including contracts for services authorized by section 3109 of title 5, United States Code, without regard to any other provision of law regarding public contracts;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear to me why the entirety of contracting law need be bypassed for this purpose; this seems to be a &#8220;stick it in your eye, Good Government&#8221; provision.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s one proposal for improvement that I&#8217;d be disinclined to pursue, it would be general executive-pay reform.  I like DeLong&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/398379129/note-to-self-hi.html">note to self</a>&#8221; on forcing pay above a threshold into restricted equity in principle, but this is not something for quick drafting, as otherwise the statute may just be an intellectual challenge for compensation consultants.  I&#8217;d keep it simple for the purpose of this legislation (assuming it&#8217;s inevitable) and just claw back any incentive pay for some specific set of officers of any firm that sells assets to Treasury under the bailout on terms that ensure the clawback comes out of the officers&#8217; personal wealth.  I&#8217;d like to see them slip in a return to the 39.6% top income tax rate, but I don&#8217;t know that the Democratic leadership has the guts to do so and let the Bushies signal how important they really think the bailout legislation is.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://rogerailes.blogspot.com/2008/09/trip-to-nowhere-shorter-sharia-palin.html">The Good Roger Ailes</a>, ABC News reports that rape kits aren&#8217;t the only thing Sarah Palin tried to leave <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/print?id=5844710">the responsibility of the victim</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Fighting back against allegations she may have fired her then-Public Safety Commissioner, Walt Monegan, for refusing to go along with a personal vendetta, Palin on Monday argued in a legal filing that she fired Monegan because he had a &#8220;rogue mentality&#8221; and was bucking her administration&#8217;s directives.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last straw,&#8221; her lawyer argued, came when he planned a trip to Washington, D.C., to seek federal funds for an aggressive anti-sexual-violence program. The project, expected to cost from $10 million to $20 million a year for five years, would have been the first of its kind in Alaska, which leads the nation in reported forcible rape.[emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>The catch:<br />
<blockquote>But the governor&#8217;s staff authorized the trip, according to an internal travel document from the Department of Public Safety, released Friday in response to an open records request.</p>
<p>The document, a state travel authorization form, shows that Palin&#8217;s chief of staff, Mike Nizich, approved Monegan&#8217;s trip to Washington, D.C., &#8220;to attend meeting with Senator Murkowski.&#8221; The date next to Nizich&#8217;s signature reads June 18. </p></blockquote>
<p>and the excuse:<br />
<blockquote>According to Ruaro, Monegan asked for—and received—approval for the travel without telling Palin&#8217;s staff his reason for going. &#8220;As a matter of routine, the travel was approved by Mike Nizich &#8230; weeks before the actual purpose was made clear by former Commissioner Monegan,&#8221; Ruaro wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>Millions for a Bridge to Nowhere, Nothing for Rape Prevention.  Glad to see she has her priorities—and Family Values—straight.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>There are three reasons that the give Paulson $700,000,000,000 to play with plan might save world finance</p>
<p>1) the value of a pool of all the mortgage based assets is easier to determine than the value of particular assets &#8212; making a huge pool of all the toxic sludge will cause it to melt, that is be liquid (check the metaphor is not mixed).</p>
<p>2) If all claims on a mortgage belong to one legal entity, that legal entity can renegotiate the terms of the mortgage and avoid foreclosing.   This is often good for creditors as a group, but when they are many, each one benefits if the others renegotiate and he she or it demands full payment.  Thus reassembling sliced and  diced mortgages will reduce the number of foreclosures with associated legal costs, delays and distress sales of foreclosed properties. </p>
<p>3) by paying more for mortgage based assets than they are worth, Paulson will re-capitalize banks and insurance companies.</p>
<p>Paulson obviously doesn&#8217;t stress the third aspect, and, to the extent that he admits it might happen, would like to present it as an inevitable side effect of the first two.</p>
<p>It is not at all.  All the gain in liquidity and ability to renegotiate which can be achieved with toxic sludge pool belonging to the treasury can be achieved with a new private entity toxic sludge inc whose shares belong to the banks that contributed the sludge.  </p>
<p>If we want to give Paulson a huge amount of authority, we can let him negotiate the price in shares of toxic sludge inc for particular assets.  That would be crazy of course, but not as crazy as letting him spend our money as he pleases.</p>
<p>I think a reasonable plan is to require all banks and insurance companies to pool all their claims on mortgages in exchange for shares proportional to the most recent market price.  The revenue from the mortgages pays them dividends, people can buy and sell shares of toxic sludge inc which is easy to price as it is a claim on a huge pool of mortgages some of which were reasonable business propositions to begin with.</p>
<p>Now a problem with this approach is that with an accurate valuation of shares of toxic sludge inc. many banks will be obviously insolvent (they are already but it isn&#8217;t obvious).</p>
<p>That is a separate problem &#8212; recapitalizing banks.  That can be done by having the treasury buy an equity stake (as proposed by Doug Elmendorf) so that the treasury shares the upside as well as the downside.  </p>
<p>More arguments after the jump.</p>
<p>One problem is that mortgage based assets are currently illiquid, because no one knows what they are worth, and, especially, because their current owners have a better idea than possible buyers.  They are hard to price in large part, because the underlying mortgages are varied.  To own a claim on the proceeds of liars loans is not the same as owning a claim on mortgages whose borrowers documented their income.  Current owners don&#8217;t know as much as they should, but they know more than non-bank investors. Thus there is a market for lemons/adverse selection problem.  The solution to adverse selection problems is a mandate.  All mortgage based assets must be sold to participate (or x% of such assets on the books of participating firms).  This was obvious to my dad and <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/garbage_pail_/2008/09/designing_the_garbage_pail_agency_percentage_proffering.php">Mark Kleiman</a> , who are real smart but not economists.  I&#8217;d say that participation in the scheme can be voluntary, provided that participating means selling all or a multiple of the portfolio of mortgage based assets with no picking and chosing.  Non participating financial institutions are not likely to survive long.</p>
<p>Paulson proposes solving the problem by having the treasury, which has poor information perverse incentives and no accountability, buy the assets for inflated prices.  That is a huge transfer from the public to shareholders and officers of banks. </p>
<p>A huge pool would be easier to price as the nationwide mix of securitized mortgages, bad as it is, produces a revenue stream which is relatively predictable. </p>
<p>Now recapitalization is all well and good, but normally the people who put up the money get an equity stake in exchange.  Recapitalizing by having people deliberately make bad deals on behalf of the public is first a transfer and second a way to guarantee corruption (even if you don&#8217;t count it as corruption in the first place).</p>
<p>There is no logical link between pooling mortgage based assets and nationalizing them.  The only point of creating that link is to privatize public money.</p>

(Or, as I would prefer to write it, just so everyone understands: $900,000,000,000.  About 3,000 a person, or 26.7% of the annual median household income, assuming a family of four.)</p>
<p>What would makes anyone think <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/just-like-beanie-babies.html">another $700,000,000,000</a> will solve the problem?  Just because &#8220;sooner or later, you&#8217;re talking about real money&#8221;?</p>
<p>It is, or should be, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/understanding-t.html">no longer possible to pretend that this is still just a liquidity crisis</a>. Certainly, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/perception-v-reality.html">the Fed isn&#8217;t doing so</a>. It is well beyond that.</p>
<p>Adding liquidity will not solve the problem. And if the plan is to buy assets above their value—then why are we expected to <em>buy</em> Beanie Babies?  Shouldn&#8217;t we be selling them to Treasury Secretary <s>Gramm</s> <s>Fiorina</s> Paulson?</p>
