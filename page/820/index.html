                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I always thought that a zero-sum game was a situation where one player’s gain or loss was exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the other player(s).  With a hat tip to <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/015511.php">Josh Marshall</a>, we see that this term is how White House Homeland Security Advisor Frances Townsend dodged a very good question from CNN’s Ed Henry:</p>
<blockquote><p>We know that intelligence estimates received by the White House prior to the invasion of Iraq warned that the invasion and occupation could give new life to al Qaeda &#8211; a boon for recruitment, fundraising and more. Yesterday, CNN&#8217;s Ed Henry asked Townsend precisely this question. Weren&#8217;t you warned about this in advance of the war and haven&#8217;t those predictions now proven out? Isn&#8217;t al Qaeda stronger and aren&#8217;t we more vulnerable because of the invasion of Iraq.  Townsend&#8217;s answer is that of course al Qaeda will use our attacks on them for propaganda purposes to further grow their movement. But it&#8217;s silly to argue that we should never attack our enemies just because they&#8217;ll try to use our attacks against us in this way. It&#8217;s not a zero sum game, she argues.  Now, Henry didn&#8217;t have the perfect follow-up ready for this response. But honestly it&#8217;s not always easy to parry this sort of bamboozlement perfectly in real time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well maybe.  As I was watching Townsend babble about zero-sum games, I was thinking – if it’s not zero, then it must be positive or negative.  Josh takes us down the road where this follow-up question might have lead:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the key point is that Townsend dodges the essential issue. This would be a decent response if people were making it as an argument against our invasion of Afghanistan, because that was after all al Qaeda&#8217;s base of operation. We were attacking them where they were. So it would be silly or at least a weak argument to say we shouldn&#8217;t have attacked Afghanistan just because al Qaeda would use the attack as a propaganda tool against us. As Townsend&#8217;s logic suggests, sure they might use it for their media campaign. But that&#8217;s far outweighed by the benefit of destroying their sanctuary.  But that&#8217;s the heart of the issue, the one Townsend dodges and which Henry unfortunately didn&#8217;t press. Iraq wasn&#8217;t a sanctuary or recruiting or training ground for al Qaeda before we invaded. This has now been as definitively established as proving a negative ever can be. So, contra Townsend, it really is a zero sum game for us since we did nothing to hurt al Qaeda by invading Iraq &#8211; they weren&#8217;t there and had no prospect of being there. But we did help them almost immeasurably by giving the whole organization a new lease on life for recruitment, fundraising and more. And the rising unpopularity of the United States in the Muslim world because of the invasion has undoubtedly played a large role in preventing Pervez Musharraf from keeping al Qaeda from reestablishing itself in Pakistan.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this is a very nice summary of the facts, let me suggest we did not have a non-zero-sum game here after all.  Non-zero-sum games are also possible where the aggregate gains and losses is either less than or more than zero.  In economics, we often think of trade as a positive sum game.  If Townsend was trying to bamboozle the press that invading Iraq was a positive sum game, one would have to be a fool to think that.  The truth is that we likely lost a lot more than Al Qaeda gained here.  Not that Al Qaeda didn’t gain a lot.  Before 3/19/2003, they were on the run and had absolutely no means for trapping us in a quagmire as we occupied a Muslim nation.  But then George W. Bush gave them what Osama bin Laden called a “gift from God”. So now Al Qaeda is back with us trapped in the Iraq quagmire, a training ground for new Al Qaeda troops, and some of the best Al Qaeda propaganda that we American taxpayers could ever give them.  And did I forget to mention how the decision on 3/19/2003 has put tremendous strains on our military?  </p>
<p>No, Al Qaeda gained a lot from the decision made on 3/19/2003 but we have lost a lot more.  The sad truth is that this chain of very unfortunate events was predicted by our intelligence but the White House choose to ignore these warnings.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Another hat tip to <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/015550.php">Josh’s blog</a> with David Kurtz finding out what’s gone wrong with US national security since 2001 in <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_30/b4043101.htm">this interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>MB: Would you consider a position in business or on Wall Street? <br />Condi Rice: I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll do long-term. I&#8217;m a terrible long-term planner.</p></blockquote>
<p>No argument here!</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://chronicle.com/temp/reprint.php?id=wkjk218zh4xt0d0g2h0b75mfk9kmfh89">an article</a> in which the author essentially asks&#8230; wouldn&#8217;t it be better to call terrorists names &#8211; &#8220;bastards, lowlife, cowards, scum&#8221; &#8211; than use the more, um, antiseptic terms usually reserved for them?</p>
<p>He belives that:<br />
<blockquote>We should not minimize the thirst for respect among terrorists and their potential sympathizers. When we treat terrorists only as tactical foes, as though we&#8217;re too jaded for moral talk, we raise the self-respect of terrorists and their appeal to young people.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sympathetic to that, to some extent.  (FWIW&#8230; I think treating terrorists as if we are at war with them is self-defeating.  If its demoralizing to be treated as &#8220;scum&#8221;, its probably more demoralizing to be treated as an idiot for believing that somehow with a few bombings, however spectacular, they can derail a system of government and a way of life like ours.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also kind of conflicted. Regular readers know I think that people who write a textbook saying X, and then become economic advisers saying something diametrically opposed to X and at no time were willing or able to show X was wrong, should not be treated with the same respect as if they stuck with X. And those that deliberately shade and obfuscate data to try to imply something that the figures don&#8217;t show, and do so repeatedly when they know better, are hacks, and should be treated as such. </p>
<p>On the other hand&#8230; at whom do the insults stop? In recent years, we&#8217;ve seen all types of accusations hurled between people at different ends of the political spectrum. As an example, even in comments to this site, some readers have suggested that those who think the invasion of Iraq was planned and handled poorly are somehow supporters of Saddam Hussein who presumably wished Hussein long life and happiness torturing and mutilating to his heart&#8217;s content. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the question of where the insults stop? The author of the piece suggests calling them cowards. As Bill Maher said&#8230; there are a lot of things one can say about some of these terrorists, but many of them cannot be called cowards. Perhaps Osama and people at that level of the organization who send other people out to die are cowards &#8211; I do not know. But someone who gives his life for a cause, however misguided, is probably no coward. </p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post is on unemployment… well, kind of – really, its on the civilian employment to population ratio.  I don’t like the unemployment rate as a figure… even disregarding issues of transparency (what are the parameters of the ARIMA model the BLS uses for forecasting – it matters, because results of ARIMAs will fluctuate quite a bit depending on one’s choice of parameters), unemployment figures depend on counting those seeking jobs.  But the “discouraged worker” effect is notorious – these are people who either have given up looking for work, or aren’t proving to the satisfaction of the unemployment office that they’re looking for working.  Since after a while unemployment compensation runs out… how many people that are unemployed for long periods are going to keep going down to the unemployment office every week to show that they’re still looking if there’s no gain to doing so?</p>
<p>Instead, I want to use civilian employment to civilian population.  The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm">BLS</a> provides the data&#8230; and civilian employment and population is for all civilians 16 and over.  Civilian employment, of course, is just an estimate, as is population, but with less to estimate, and no need to guess whether people who don’t have a job are actually looking for one, there’s less room for error.</p>
<p>So here’s the civilian employment to population ratio for people over 16…</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rp377bCZtjI/AAAAAAAAAdg/LsWPZvug9jc/s1600-h/Employment+to+Pop+ratio+graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rp377bCZtjI/AAAAAAAAAdg/LsWPZvug9jc/s320/Employment+to+Pop+ratio+graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Now, it could be that this figure is very dependent on women entering the workforce, or teenagers getting jobs.  So let’s narrow down a bit… to the civilian employment to population ratio for males age 20+ which is also provided by the BLS.  Presumably, most of these people (and I wish the data allowed us to separate out retirees!) would have needed jobs before and after women’s lib and whatever cultural changes might have occurred in the population.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rp3717CZtiI/AAAAAAAAAdY/Oiu9fPCEe50/s1600-h/Employment+to+Pop+ratio+graph+2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rp3717CZtiI/AAAAAAAAAdY/Oiu9fPCEe50/s320/Employment+to+Pop+ratio+graph+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So what do we learn from this… well, there is a greater share of the population employed over time.  But males 20+ are having a harder time finding employment, or in my opinion far less likely, mooching off their wives/girlfriends and enjoying leisure time.  It seems some of the employment obtained by teenagers and women has come at the expense of men’s employment prospects.  I’m really surprised… maybe I haven’t considered this carefully enough, but offhand it seems to me it lends a bit of support to the “lump of labor” concept, the notion that there are only so many jobs at any one time.  On the other hand, it could alternatively mean that with more people to pick from, employers are no longer having to accept the least desirable men into the workforce.  Also, we all know that many of the jobs traditionally considered to be men’s jobs (assembly line workers, lumberjacks, milkmen, gas station attendants, programmers, barbers, etc.) have mostly disappeared and/or been outsourced and/or have morphed and are no longer considered &#8220;men&#8217;s&#8221; jobs.</p>
<p>Now a summary for each series…</p>

<p>Overall civilian employment to population rose in the Carter, Reagan, Clinton, and JFK/LBJ administrations, which were also the administrations with the fastest <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">growth rate of real GDP per capita</a>, though not in the same order.  </p>
<p>For males 20+, the ratio only increased during the Clinton administration, though declines were small during Reagan, JFK/LBJ, and Carter.</p>
<p>I note…  GW’s 2003 – 2006 performance puts him behind Clinton and above JFK/LBJ overall, and in first place for Males 20+.  Cherry-picking sometimes works!  However, it does seem that both series may have hit a local peak in December of 2006… monthly figures have been declining since then.  Perhaps GW won’t look as good when measured from 2003 to the rest of his term.  We don’t hear much out of him about employment since 2003 any more, but maybe that’s because he isn’t campaigning for anything any more.  All that said&#8230;  has there been an increase in employment of traditionally male jobs?</p>
<p>FWIW… a means test for each series rejects the null hypothesis that the growth rates are the same under Dem as under Rep administrations at the 95% level for both series.  If the assumptions of the t-test are acceptable, we would conclude that growth rates of the civilian employment to population ratio (both series) are faster under Dem administrations.</p>
<p>That’s about all the time I have right now.  I think I should revisit this as soon as possible and see how these series tie in with other things (changes in real GDP per capita, inflation, etc.)</p>

<p>Update&#8230; Originally I forgot to list the BLS site from which I took the data.</p>

                                <p>The first of a series of posts on the US health care system. Some will focus on narrow issues, other posts will take a macro look at the system.</p>
<p>For now I will be posting under two assumptions, namely 1) the US healthcare system needs reform, and 2) single payer in NOT on the near horizon.</p>
<p>*          *          *          *          *          *       *       *</p>
<p>Wal-Mart, Target  and CVS Pharmacies, among others, are starting in-store clinics, to be staffed by Family Nurse Practitioners (FNPs), who are specially trained RNs. Wal-Mart is apparently contracting with existing companies for many of their clinics.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart has already made great inroads in pharmacy and optometry services, and certainly has the traffic (optometry is low risk and no-blood).</p>
<p>I have hired and supervised FNPs and many of them are really terrific.</p>
<p>I have no great feelings on this one way or the other, but it does deserve some discussion.<br />This is my list of pros and cons.</p>
<p>Pros:<br />Improved access, which is always good<br />Lower cost, at least for the initial fee<br />Immediate access to pharmacy services<br />FNPS are generally very skilled at triaging minor ailments<br />FNPs are usually good at picking up and referring major problems<br />This could relieve FPs of  evening and weekend calls<br />This could relieve traffic in Emergency Departments<br />Good for routine vaccinations</p>
<p>Cons:<br />Patients may think they don’t need a relationship with a physician<br />Patients have a procrastination tendency, this may encourage that tendency<br />Not all FNPs are experienced enough to staff such a clinic, hard to evaluate<br />In most states there has to be a supervisory relationship with an MD, I’m not certain<br />    how well that will work, or how loose it will be<br />The tie to the pharmacy could cause conflicts of interest<br />This could stretch the pool of FNPs very thin<br />Will the FNPs miss issues an FP would find?<br />The economics of family practice already stink, this could hurt some FPs</p>
<p>I pulled up some FNP cost studies and I think it will be very difficult to make any money, but I don’t have full data.  If this service is offered as a “loss leader,” what are the ethical considerations?</p>
<p>For those of you who resent the profits of health insurance companies, would Wal-Mart healthcare profits be something different?</p>
<p>Does this program make sense? Would you use the service? Do the ethical concerns bother any of you?</p>

<p>Whatever one thinks of the war in Iraq and recent progress that may or may not be occurring there, I don&#8217;t understand what is gained by writing something like this. Consider a simple thought experiment&#8230;.</p>
<p>1. What percentage of Iraqis not from Anbar would agree to spend two weeks in Anbar, with the proviso that they have to spend at least an hour or two a day walking around populated areas unescorted and unarmed, if offered the equivalent of one year&#8217;s median income for an Iraqi in exchange?<br />2. What percentage of Iraqis would agree to spend two weeks in NYC, with the proviso that they have to spend at least an hour or two a day walking around populated areas unescorted and unarmed, if offered the equivalent of one year&#8217;s median income for an Iraqi in exchange?<br />3. What percentage of Americans would agree to spend two weeks in Anbar, with the proviso that they have to spend at least an hour or two a day walking around populated areas unescorted and unarmed, if offered the equivalent of one year&#8217;s median income for an American in exchange?<br />4. What percentage of Americans not from NY would agree to spend two weeks in NYC, with the proviso that they have to spend at least an hour or two a day walking around populated areas unescorted and unarmed, if offered the equivalent of one year&#8217;s median income for an American in exchange?<br />5. What percentage of people not from Iraq or the US would agree to spend two weeks in Anbar, with the proviso that they have to spend at least an hour or two a day walking around populated areas unescorted and unarmed, if offered the equivalent of one year&#8217;s median income for someone from their country in exchange?<br />6. What percentage of people not from Iraq or the US would agree to spend two weeks in NYC, with the proviso that they have to spend at least an hour or two a day walking around populated areas unescorted and unarmed, if offered the equivalent of one year&#8217;s median income for someone from their country in exchange?<br />7. How much would it take to get the author of this piece to spend two weeks in Anbar, with the proviso he has to spend at least an hour or two a day walking around populated areas unescorted and unarmed?<br />8. How much would it take to get the author of this piece to spend two weeks in NYC, with the proviso he has to spend at least an hour or two a day walking around populated areas unescorted and unarmed?</p>
<p>I imagine the answers to the even number questions are significantly different from the answers to the odd number questions.</p>

                                <p>This post is on the number of jobs in the US economy over time. Just about every candidate for President promises he/she will create jobs, and just about every President that can boasts about job creation. So let’s see how they do. Data on job creation comes from <a href="http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm">BLS table Table LNS12000000</a>, Seasonal Employment Level. </p>
<p>OK. So what does the (annual average) seasonally adjusted civilian labor force look like? </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpyunrCZtcI/AAAAAAAAAco/uSVFAdXfxCk/s1600-h/Civilian+Employment,+Graph.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpyunrCZtcI/AAAAAAAAAco/uSVFAdXfxCk/s320/Civilian+Employment,+Graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpyusLCZtdI/AAAAAAAAAcw/Z4qq4FEV6hk/s1600-h/Civilian+Employment,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpyusLCZtdI/AAAAAAAAAcw/Z4qq4FEV6hk/s320/Civilian+Employment,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Fastest growth… Carter. Second fastest… Nixon/Ford. Then Reagan leading Clinton and JFK/LBJ by a smidge. Recall that the four administrations under whom <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">growth rate of real GDP per capita</a> was the fastest were in order JFK/LBJ, Clinton, Reagan, and Carter. A fast growing economy creates jobs, and jobs create a fast growing economy. More on this in a moment, but first a couple comments… First, a means test under the null hypothesis that the creation of jobs under Reps is the same as the creation of jobs under Dems is rejected at the 10% level (P value of 0.095). If the assumptions of the means test are acceptable under the circumstances, it would seem that job creation is more favorable under Dem administrations than under Rep administrations. Second, GW likes to talk about job creation since mid-2003. Well, the annualized rate of job creation between 2003 and 2006 is… 1.59%. Five administrations did better (during their entire term) than GW did under the cherry-picked term. </p>
<p>Back to: a fast growing economy creates jobs, and jobs create a fast growing economy. Or is that what we should conclude? Do more people getting jobs lead to growth? Does faster growth lead to more employment? Both? Neither?</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpyuxbCZteI/AAAAAAAAAc4/HCJ0wlleRpw/s1600-h/Civilian+Employment,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpyuxbCZteI/AAAAAAAAAc4/HCJ0wlleRpw/s320/Civilian+Employment,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The table indicates that the strongest correlation between the growth rate of the two series occurs in the same year. But… a quickly growing economy is also correlated positively (0.35) though not strongly with an increase in employment next year. The table seems to indicate that a fast growing economy is more likely to generate new jobs than new jobs are to generate a fast growing economy.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>I think from here the place to go is the employment population ratio. And I think that particularly statistic should be split into male versus female&#8230; the ratio of women who want jobs has changed over time as cultural norms have changed. I&#8217;ll try to write up a post on that some time soon.</p>

<p>Reader Dan adds to the WTO GATS trade agreements posts:</p>
<p>This site defines who is writing the US Trade Reps:  </p>
<blockquote><p>The World Trade Organization has set a July deadline for negotiating a text within the WTO’s Working Party on Domestic Regulation (WPDR). States are concerned because the negotiations could affect services that states traditionally provide or regulate such as public utilities, health facilities and licensing of professionals. The negotiations are authorized under GATS, the General Agreement on Trade in Services. </p>
<p>Letters to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) have come from three multi-state working groups (on services, energy policy and prescription drugs), oversight committees in Maine and California, the governors of Maine and Oregon, and a joint letter from attorneys general in 25 states. Two of the working groups submitted detailed case studies of how the WTO proposals could affect domestic regulation: one on coastal regulation of liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities and one on nursing qualifications.</p></blockquote>
<p>We learn more <a href="http://quebec.indymedia.org/en/node/13082?PHPSESSID=d360da731fc605a1b3ec4bac75d26216">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two other  sets of documents suggest that LOTIS and other corporate lobbyists appeared to have been astonishingly successful in getting Western governments to adopt their plans to radically expand the reach of the GATS treaty. A confidential memo dated March 19th obtained from inside the WTO&#8217;s Secretariat, written four weeks after the LOTIS meeting on the matter, indicates that European negotiators had accepted industry-favored amendments to GATS Article VI.4, known as the &#8220;necessity test.&#8221;</p>
<p>The necessity test requires nations to prove that their regulations &#8212; from pollution control to child labor laws &#8212; are not hidden impediments to trade. Industry wants the WTO to employ a necessity test similar to the one in the North America Free Trade Agreement which has worked to reverse local environmental rules. For example, Mexico has been forced to pay $17 million to an American corporation, Metalclad, for delaying the operation of the company&#8217;s toxic waste dump and processing plant. Local Mexican officials had attempted to block the plant&#8217;s operation on the grounds that it was built without a construction permit, and would not have received one, as the plant handling toxins was placed above the area&#8217;s drinking water supply.</p>
<p>According to the secret March 19 memo from the Working Party on Domestic Regulation, issued to WTO members by the organization&#8217;s Secretariat, European negotiators reached a private consensus to change the worldwide GATS agreement to include a much stronger form of the necessity test than found even in NAFTA. The Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico only requires that a nation&#8217;s regulations be &#8220;least trade restrictive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the GATS, as proposed in the memo, national laws and regulations would be struck down if they are &#8220;more burdensome than necessary&#8221; to business. The difference between the NAFTA language and the proposal for GATS is subtle, but the effect would be enormous. The language in the WTO memo effectively removes trade from the equation. Rather, a nation would have to adopt rules which are, in the memo&#8217;s words, the most &#8220;efficient&#8221; &#8212; that is to say those which carry the lowest cost to business.</p></blockquote>
<p>Freeing up some barriers to trade can work to benefit all, and bi-lateral agreements do include &#8216;necessity tests&#8217; to help smooth trade barriers away, many more than NAFTA.  WTO GATS Article V was a comparative advantage document between nations for economic integration, Article VII addressed de jure non-discrimintory issues, and VI.4 is to address domestic regulation through &#8216;necessity tests&#8217; that the nation must prove are &#8216;efficient&#8217; or not &#8216;more burdensome than necessary&#8217;.  The burden of proof is on the member, not the WTO.  Interesting approach as a grand experiment, but apparently, as always with so much money involved, is being gamed as well.  </p>
<p>Free is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>What is going to happen in globalization is well on the way, and promises many benefits, but is it sufficient to say the Hand will provide?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/13/AR2007071301709.html">Bill Kristol</a> does three things here: (1) suggests Bush’s tax cuts kept America’s economy from total meltdown; (2) credit Bush’s leadership for the fact that we have not had a second 9/11; and (3) totally gets silly on Iraq:</p>
<blockquote><p>And third, and most important, a war in Iraq that has been very difficult, but where &#8211; despite some confusion engendered by an almost meaningless &#8220;benchmark&#8221; report last week &#8211; we now seem to be on course to a successful outcome … First of all, we would have to compare the situation in Iraq now, with all its difficulties and all the administration&#8217;s mistakes, with what it would be if we hadn&#8217;t gone in. Saddam Hussein would be alive and in power and, I dare say, victorious, with the United States (and the United Nations ) by now having backed off sanctions and the no-fly zone. He might well have restarted his nuclear program, and his connections with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups would be intact or revived and even strengthened.  Still, that&#8217;s speculative, and the losses and costs of the war are real. Bush is a war president, and war presidents are judged by whether they win or lose their war. So to be a successful president, Bush has to win in Iraq.  Which I now think we can. Indeed, I think we will.</p></blockquote>
<p>I keep asking this – how do these neocons define win?  OK, we got rid of Saddam four years ago.  But we leave our troops there.  Kristol wants to do a counterfactual here – what would the place look like had we not toppled Saddam four years ago.  Number one – Al Qaeda would not be there.  In fact, we might have beaten Al Qaeda completely had we stayed focused on that threat and had we not given Osama bin Laden the best recruiting tool he could have ever wished for.  Number two – Iran would not be the dominant player in the region.  But now there are.  Of course, Kristol digs into his bag of rightwing lies to suggest Saddam was working with Osama bin Laden and had an active nuclear program.  But <a href="http://time-blog.com/swampland/2007/07/why_bush_will_be_a_winner_.html">Jay Carney</a> doesn’t even need to go there to mock the most recent stupidity from Kristol: </p>
<blockquote><p>Blowing past years of disastrous mismanagement of the war, Kristol says that Bush will ultimately be viewed a winner because &#8220;we now seem to be on course to a successful outcome&#8221; in Iraq. Now, even if you believed from the beginning that invading Iraq and toppling Saddam was the right thing to do. And even if you&#8217;ve never wavered from those convictions. And even if you argued last winter that more troops were necessary and that &#8220;surging&#8221; was the right thing to do. And even if you insist that there have been some modest &#8211; very modest &#8211; signs of improvement in a few (not many!) areas of Iraq in the past few months, wouldn&#8217;t you be deluding yourself, and testing the gullibility of your readers (given the cumulative experience of the past four-plus years, and all the mistaken predictions you and others had made about how well things were going in Iraq), if you suddenly decided that these few modest signs of improvement somehow proved that a) &#8220;we now seem to be on course to a successful outcome&#8221;, and b) Bush&#8217;s presidency will therefore be judged a success? What&#8217;s next? Promises that Iraqis will welcome new rotations of American G.I.&#8217;s with roses? Assurances that the next $200 billion in war costs will be paid with Iraqi oil revenue?</p></blockquote>
<p>Jay?  Jay?  What’s this $200 billion?  Bill Kristol predicted back in 2002 that the Iraq invasion would cost only 0.1% to 0.2% of one year’s worth of GDP.  That’s about $20 billion.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>In 2003 the tiny Caribbean nation of Antigua filed a case against the<br />US with the WTO. The case was about US initiatives to restrict online<br />gambling. These initiatives effectively barred all foreign run online<br />gambling companies from operating within the US.</p>
<p>In 2004, the WTO ruled for Antigua, and in 2005 an appeal by the US also ruled for the tiny nation. The US was given 11 months and 2 weeks to comply. To comply, the US had to repeal it&#8217;s laws allowing interstate gambling, specifically the Interstate Horseracing Act (and a similar one allowing gambling between 2 states as long as it is legal in both), or allow all Internet gambling. The US chose not to do either.</p>
<p>In 2006, The US passed a law, making it illegal for credit card companies to process payments for online gambling sites. It also started arresting directors of foreign online gambling companies who happened to set foot on US soil. This has served to strengthen Antigua&#8217;s hand in it&#8217;s WTO proceedings. It was also against the US GATS commitments in the WTO. These commitments were the same ones that the US pushed so hard for and spent years negotiating. They basically bring services into the purview of the WTO.</p>
<p>Because of the intransigence of the US, the WTO expanded it&#8217;s look into state gambling laws, which it had initially refused to consider, and found them to be also in violation of the GATS agreements. Things like state run lotteries, Indian casinos, and limits on numbers of casinos were now under threat. On top of that, Antigua is asking for $3.4 billion per year in sanctions until the US complies with the WTO order.</p>
<p>The US is trying to withdraw gambling from it&#8217;s GATS commitments. Initially, it tried to argue that it didn&#8217;t mean to include gambling, which didn&#8217;t do down very well with the other WTO members. From some sources, the US is still maintaining that it doesn&#8217;t have to do anything to withdraw, but from others it is using the GATS provided for mechanism for withdrawing obligations. The mechanism allows a member to withdraw it&#8217;s obligations in one area by opening up other services to other countries. Services like education have been mentioned.</p>
<p>Any government that says its interests are harmed by a change to pledges opening borders at the WTO is entitled to request negotiations with the US. Action by the EU, India and Japan have been started, with talks of Canada and Brazil also joining in.</p>
<p>Do we, as a country, really have any moral objections to gambling? No. It&#8217;s everywhere. Then why have we painted ourselves into this corner? What are we going to give up to protect gambling in the US? To the rest of the world, this is just another example of the US reneging on it&#8217;s commitments when it doesn&#8217;t suit US interests, and many are starting to wonder why they should live up to their commitments when they are counter to their own country&#8217;s interests.</p>
