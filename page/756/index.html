                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I see the history rewriters are tying to develop a new meme about FDR and the depression.  They are now trying to argue that FDR scared businessmen and capitalist so badly that they were unwilling to invest and this was why the recovery was so weak and the depression lasted so long.
</p>
<p>As usual, they take a historic fact, that investment in the recovery was weak, and blame it on the New Deal policies and conclude that the New Deal had a negative impact. As the chart below shows, real nonresidential fixed investment in the depression was very weak when you compare it to post war cycles.  Note, that in the chart I have rescaled the post-war cycles so you can easily compare the differences.  The data is rescaled in two ways. One, the post-war data is quarterly data while the depression data is annual data.  Two, the post-war data is on the right scale and the depression data is on the left scale and the scales are set so that the magnitude of the downturns appears similar even though the depression downturn was much larger.</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Rz3mzabW4OI/AAAAAAAAACE/U_vDTiq50wU/s1600-h/Clipboard+D1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Rz3mzabW4OI/AAAAAAAAACE/U_vDTiq50wU/s320/Clipboard+D1.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
</p>
<p>The argument is that the weaker depression rebound was because FDR scared investors.  It ignors the possibility that other factors that normally drive investment  might have been responsible. Over the years as a business economist I have concluded that three factors dominate business fixed investment.  They are corporate profits, capacity utilization, and the stock market.  The stock market is earnings times the market PE.  So using stocks as a variable captures the cost 0f capital as the market PE is it&#8217;s inverse.  But it also means the variables double counts profits.  For capacity utilization I use the gap between potential real GDP published by the Congressional Budget Office and actual real GDP.  Not to get into a detailed discussion, but the following chart shows how well changes in the three variables have explained changes in real nonresidential fixed investment since WW II.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Rz3nq6bW4PI/AAAAAAAAACM/-5Y6BpfBqQE/s1600-h/Clipboard+D2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Rz3nq6bW4PI/AAAAAAAAACM/-5Y6BpfBqQE/s320/Clipboard+D2.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>
</p>
<p>So the next step is to see how well these variables explain real nonresidential fixed investment during the depression.  If they do a poor job it might imply that New Deal did scare business and capitalist  into not investing. There is one problem in doing an exact comparison.  The CBO does not calculate a real potential GDP series for the pre-war era so I can not calculate the GDP Gap for the earlier era in the same way.  But it is an easy problem to surmount.  From 1900 to around 1975 trend real gdp growth in the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">US</place></country-region> was 3.5%. as this chart shows.  So it is easy to substitute this trend real GDP series for potential real GDP to calculate the GDP gap.</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Rz3oF6bW4QI/AAAAAAAAACU/K28WwiRzb8o/s1600-h/Clipboard+D3.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Rz3oF6bW4QI/AAAAAAAAACU/K28WwiRzb8o/s320/Clipboard+D3.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
</p>
<p>So what did I find?  I find that these three variables, profits, the GDP gap and the stock market do a great job of explaining real nonresidential fixed investment during the 1930s. One of the interesting points to make is that the equation does an outstanding job of capturing the turning points at the 1933 bottom and around the 1937-38 second recession.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Rz3ooabW4RI/AAAAAAAAACc/q3J8GcDfUmQ/s1600-h/Clipboard+D4.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Rz3ooabW4RI/AAAAAAAAACc/q3J8GcDfUmQ/s320/Clipboard+D4.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>
</p>
<p>In two years, 1935 and 1936 actual real capital spending was right at the bottom of the one standard error band and in one year, 1937, capital spending was moderately higher then the equation implied it should have been.  But it has to be obvious that overall, the three factors of profits, capacity utilization and the stock market do an outstanding job of explaining business fixed investment in the depression just as they do in the post-WW II era.  On balance this work clearly implies that the argument that FDR scared businessmen and capitalist into not investing is strictly a myth that is not at all supported by the data.  Compared to post WW II cycles capital spending was weak in the late 1930s, but it was weak largely because of the massive excess capacity created by the economic collapse from 1929 to 1933, not anything FDR did.</p>

<p>It’s been a while since I ventured over to the <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWNhNzY4NjZiYWU5YTI4N2RiYzlhN2ZlZTU2MjEyMWE=">National Review</a> and its economic know nothings but it seems Thomas Nugent doesn’t even understand numbers.  Beyond the stupidity about Nixon causing the stagflation of the 1970’s by some move to fiscal restraint (oh – it must hurt to realize that once a Republican President actually increased taxes), Nugent wants us to believe that economic growth since George W. Bush took office has been fantastic:</p>
<blockquote><p>The adversaries of President George W. Bush are having a hard time dealing with the fact that the economy continues to do well: a 3.9 percent jump in GDP for the third quarter, a 4.9 percent increase in productivity, surprisingly low inflation, and booming exports even though “everybody around the world really hates us.” At the same time, tax-revenue data has been impressive. Since the Bush tax cuts of 2003, tax revenues have been surging (and the deficit falling) alongside an expanding economy &#8230; In terms of the seven-year economic expansion and the more recent state of the war effort, the beefs have it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm – we are winning in Iraq and tax revenues have soared so much that those massive Clinton deficits have almost turned into Bush surpluses.  What a moron.  Nugent reports the growth in real GDP for ONE QUARTER and then wants us to believe this has been typical for the past 6.75 years.  Time to consult some <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">BEA data</a>.  Real GDP as of 2007QIII was 17.63% higher than it was as of 2000QIV.  Average annual growth therefore has been only 2.4 percent – not 3.9 percent.  Even a village idiot should realize this.  </p>
<p>But before you fall for Nugent’s booming export canard, let’s consult our graph that shows both exports and imports relative to GDP from 2000QI to 2007QIII.  It seems that part of the downfall in aggregate demand growth during Bush’s first term in office was a decline in exports relative to GDP.  The good news is that the export to GDP ratio has climbed back up with it reaching 12 percent last quarter.  Of course, the import to GDP ratio exceeds 17 percent.  But hey – you knew we have a huge trade deficit.  I guess Nugent and the other economic nitwits at the National Review assume their readers are too stupid to realize what almost everyone on the planet has realized for years.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: How did I miss the big flat lie:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the balance of the 1970s, the Nixon/Ford/Carter presidencies kept inflation and interest rates in the double digits</p></blockquote>
<p>Inflation may have exceeded 10 percent for a couple of brief periods but it was not double digit for most of the decade &#8211; nor were interest rates.  I’ve provided a time series graph of one of the usual interest rates folks discuss: the 10-year Federal bond rate.  Now if Mr. Nugent can find some other interest rate that had been double-digit for most of the 1970’s, let him provide that.  Otherwise – his readers should realize that this village idiot has lied to them again.  </p>

<p>Incredulous over coffee this morning we read <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/16/business/DOLLAR.php">this story</a> reporting that Secretary Paulson of Treasury is in South Africa talking up a “strong dollar.”</p>
<p>“He told reporters traveling with him that the six-year expansion would continue and that growth would ultimately be reflected in the value of the currency.”  Talking to foreign central bankers and investment bankers and global bankers is one thing.  Spouting nonsense is another. </p>
<p>With credit markets all-but-frozen in the United States, especially in mortgage markets, and a severe slowdown occurring in key sectors such as automobiles and real estate, and the Everybunny consumers faltering at the retail level, and massive losses being declared by banking and investment institutions across the country – we hear this from our Treasury Department? </p>
<p>So who does our newspaper most often-read by expatriates abroad, the International Herald Tribune, quote prominently in support of Sec Paulson?  A spokesman for his old firm Goldman Sachs, as follows:  “He&#8217;s trying to instill a bit of confidence in the market, in the dollar,&#8221; said Jens Nordvig, senior global markets economist at Goldman Sachs in New York . &#8220;That&#8217;s the purpose of this. This is what European policy makers want to hear, Canadians as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think the operative phrase here is “what European policy makers want to hear. . .”  Mr. Paulson knows better.  Talking about the long run when you have a severe situation in the short run is misleading the markets, IMHO.  Time and time again I’ve been told, “To be right in the long run and act on such beliefs in the short run is to be WRONG.”  I’ve proven that to myself by first “shorting” the Financial Index of stocks in the US in 2006, and dropping that “short” after a while, only to watch the Financial Index nosedive in 2007.  I’ve proven it again and again.  Markets don’t reward clairvoyants with early returns, but rather punish them.  The same should happen to Mr. Paulson. </p>
<p>What foreign central bankers and traders need to hear is the truth, and the American public as well.  As conditions change, and the huge credit cycle moves toward more cautious values and lending conditions, and prices of financial assets arrives at some new level and direction of movement, then and only then should Mr. Paulson be making the kinds of statements that he made in South Africa.  Forming a huge chorus of cynical optimists and all singing the Happy Song should be left to Hollywood , prisoner populations hoping for amnesty, and nursing homes. </p>
<p>Mr. Paulson, How about making a speech about what Washington is going to do to reduce official deficits, raise interest rates to squeeze off inflation, punish Wall Street greed, and improve wages for the middle class?</p>

<blockquote><p>When the Democratic presidential candidates pause from beating Hillary with a stick, they join in unison to pronounce the Democratic pieties, chief among which is that George Bush has left our alliances in ruins. As Clinton puts it, we have “alienated our friends,” must “rebuild our alliances” and “restore our standing in the world.” That’s mild. The others describe Bush as having a scorched-earth foreign policy that has left us reviled and isolated in the world.</p>
<p>The Democrats are living in what Bob Woodward would call a state of denial. Do they not notice anything?</p>
<p>France has a new president who is breaking not just with the anti-Americanism of the Chirac era but also with 50 years of Fifth Republic orthodoxy that defined French greatness as operating in counterpoise to America. Nicolas Sarkozy&#8217;s trip last week to the United States was marked by a highly successful White House visit and a rousing speech to Congress in which he not only called America &#8220;the greatest nation in the world&#8221; (how many leaders of any country say that about another?) but also pledged solidarity with the United States on Afghanistan, Iran, Lebanon, the Middle East and nuclear nonproliferation. This just a few months after he sent his foreign minister to Iraq to signal an openness to cooperation and an end to Chirac&#8217;s reflexive obstructionism.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s France. In Germany, Gerhard Schroeder is long gone, voted out of office and into a cozy retirement as Putin&#8217;s concubine at Gazprom. His successor is the decidedly pro-American Angela Merkel, who concluded an unusually warm visit with Bush this week.</p>
<p>All this, beyond the ken of Democrats, is duly noted by new British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who in an interview with Sky News on Sunday remarked on &#8220;the great change that is taking place,&#8221; namely &#8220;that France and Germany and the European Union are also moving more closely with America.&#8221;<br />ad_icon</p>
<p>As for our other traditional alliances, relations with Australia are very close, and Canada has shown remarkable steadfastness in taking disproportionate casualties in supporting the NATO mission in Afghanistan. Eastern European nations, traditionally friendly, are taking considerable risks on behalf of their U.S. alliance &#8212; for example, cooperating with us on missile defense in the face of enormous Russian pressure. And ties with Japan have never been stronger, with Tokyo increasingly undertaking military and quasi-military obligations that it had forsworn for the past half-century.</p>
<p>So much for the disarray of our alliances. </p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with France&#8230; there are actions and there are words.  And perhaps the new French President has noticed our President likes words more than action.  Calling yourself fiscally disciplined is better than being fiscally disciplined, saying you&#8217;re a uniter and not a divider is better than being a uniter and not a divider, etc.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a question&#8230; how many troops has Sarkozy pledged to GW that France will send to Iraq?</p>
<p>Germany&#8230; same same question, substitute in Merkel for Sarkozy.  </p>
<p>The British seem to be thinking about further drawdowns.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/16/asia/AS-GEN-Australia-Iraq.php">Australia</a>&#8230; well, its a fictional country, but they&#8217;re slated to have elections there next week</p>
<blockquote><p>Australia would withdraw about half of its 1,000 troops from Iraq and consider sending them to Afghanistan if the government changes at elections next week, an opposition lawmaker said Friday.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>Prime Minister John Howard, who had sent 2,000 troops to support U.S. and British forces in the 2003 Iraq invasion, has promised to maintain current troop levels in Iraq as long as they are needed and welcome.</p>
<p>His center-right coalition is trailing center-left Labor in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 24 elections.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5insMeyWFEGeEatZ8AuWJlGNCmVHgD8SUL6OO0">Japan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fukuda wants Bush to back away from a pledge to remove North Korea from a terrorism blacklist until the North accounts for kidnapped Japanese citizens. Removal from the list is a key North Korean demand in nuclear disarmament talks, and the Bush administration agreed in February to begin that process.</p>
<p>Tokyo argues that ignoring its views could sour an alliance seen as a lynchpin for Asian security. If Fukuda should return to Japan empty-handed on the terror-list question, it could have political consequences for his new administration and for U.S.-Japanese ties.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be viewed by many as a litmus test about how credible the U.S. is, and that&#8217;s not a test we can afford to fail a year after the North Koreans tested a nuclear weapon,&#8221; said Michael Green, Bush&#8217;s former senior adviser on Asia.</p>
<p>Japan is America&#8217;s top ally in Asia and one of six nations involved in the nuclear talks. But Japan, which has a pacifist constitution written by the United States after World War II, is debating its future contribution to the U.S.-led fight against terrorists.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>U.S. lawmakers in both political parties have expressed worry about alienating Japan.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Such measures are supposed to be used to prevent other countries from selling their goods here at below-market prices, and that makes sense. But as Index co-editor Mary Anastasia O’Grady points out, America now overuses this tool. In fact, since 1995, the United States has trailed only India in the number of antidumping cases it has filed.Many of those came as a result of the Byrd Amendment, named for Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia. This amendment encourages producers to file complaints with the government, because if any “dumping” is found, they get to share in the penalties collected.The World Trade Organization ruled two years ago that the Byrd Amendment violates international trade policies, and the U.S. has promised to comply with the WTO. But we haven’t done so yet, which means that eight American trading partners soon could retaliate against our unfair trade practices &#8212; a move that could start a trade war.There’s no need for that. After all, trade wars are expensive and end up hurting everybody, while, as the Index proves year in and year out, free trade builds economies and ends up helping everybody.If more of our politicians will recognize the benefits of economic freedom and go back to promoting it, next year we can return to the top 10 worldwide. And that would be good news &#8212; for everybody.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/business/worldbusiness/16trade.html?th&#038;emc=th">The NYT</a> reports China is making moves as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>The directive, issued in June, called for burdensome new safety inspections for foreign-made medical devices — but not for those made in China. The Bush administration is crying foul.</p>
<p>Even more worrisome to the administration is that the directive seems part of a recent pattern in which Chinese officials issue new regulations aimed at favoring Chinese industries over foreign competitors, despite efforts by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to ease economic tensions.</p>
<p>“There is clearly a growing economic nationalism in China that is leading to discrimination against foreign investors in pillar sectors of the economy,” said Myron Brilliant, vice president for Asia at the United States Chamber of Commerce. “It’s not only a threat to foreign investors but it also undermines China’s transition to a market-based economy.”</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Regular readers may recall the saga of McGinty (a.k.a. The Big Pooper), the monster cat (now at 21 pounds) that the Ex-GF and I kidnapped from behind the dumpster where she was living.  Previously, she had been one of the many cats on my feral cat feeding route.  A bit friendlier than most, which helps explain how the kidnapping plot was hatched.</p>
<p>Anyhow, Big Poop usually spends much of the day assisting me on my work &#8211; her favorite perch is at the edge of my desk where she has a great view of whatever is on the monitor.  That is, when her eyes are open.  But she also likes to lie in various other places &#8211; the new rug, the couch, a double wide cat scratcher on the balcony, and the bed are all favorites.  And over the past year and change, she&#8217;s become something of a talker.  If you come upon a piece of furniture that has been catted, she usually looks up at you and meows a hello. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what that looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rz2L6rYBdAI/AAAAAAAAA24/HPq7Hg1nUZs/s1600-h/mcginty+sitting+on+bed"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rz2L6rYBdAI/AAAAAAAAA24/HPq7Hg1nUZs/s320/mcginty+sitting+on+bed" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>She&#8217;s a handsome cat, despite the cauliflower ear.</p>

                                <p>This post includes two graphs I&#8217;ve put up in previous posts.  One graph is the top marginal income tax rate (data from <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histaba.pdf">the IRS</a>), and the other is the real GDP per capita (from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">BEA NIPA Table 7.1</a>).  I&#8217;m also adding the annual percentage change in real GDP per capita.  I just figured it would be interesting to have it all in the same place.  It gives the folks who believe that tax cuts are the end all-be all the opportunity to tell us a story about how tax rates are affecting growth.  All I ask from them&#8230; be consistent, time only flows in one direction.  </p>

<p>Update&#8230; the original version of the third graph was annual change by fiscal year.  I&#8217;ve updated the graph&#8230; all three are by calendar year now.  Apologies.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>BTW&#8230; here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m seeing, to help those who want to tell us a story&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  the first major cut in taxes seems to be in 1964, and then in 1965.  That cut follows several years of increasing growth rates.  <br />2.  There&#8217;s a tax hike (70% to 75.25%) in LBJ&#8217;s last year&#8230; coinciding with fast growth.  I don&#8217;t know when in the year that tax cut happened, but the following year (a year that Nixon also cut taxes) growth rates weren&#8217;t too hot, and they were worse  the year after that.<br />3.  Nixon had a few good years after his 1971 tax cuts bringing the top marginal rate back to 70%. <br />4.  The next cut was a smidge in Reagan&#8217;s first year, and then from 69.5% to 50% in Reagan&#8217;s second year.  There was a huge jump in real GDP per capita growth the next few years.  <br />5.  Reagan&#8217;s next two tax cuts &#8211; in 1987 and 1988 are accompanied by increases in the annual change in real GDP per capita.  The next year, the first year after these tax cuts took effect, 1989, looks awful.<br />7.  The year GHW&#8217;s tax hike, 1990, doesn&#8217;t look so good.  But the tax hike was enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 &#8211; in November (remember, one&#8217;s story must have some reasonable causality).  The next year, the growth in real GDP per capita went from bad to worse.<br />8.  Clinton also had an Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act &#8211; passed in August of 1993.  That year, the growth rate dropped.  The next year&#8230; it rose.  It had another down year, and then stayed up.<br />9.  GW had small cuts in the top rate in 2001 and 2002, and a bigger one in 2003.  Growth was negative in 2001, tiny in 2002, and still somewhat small in 2003.  2004 was his best year, and growth rates have been drifting down since. </p>
<p>My best guess&#8230;  same story I&#8217;ve told before&#8230; tax cuts may help when tax rates are too high.  And they may help in the year immediately following the tax cut, but seem to be unmaintanable.  (Presumably we can&#8217;t cut tax rates every year to eternity.)</p>
<p>One other thing&#8230;  as tax rates have drifted lower, we&#8217;re also seeing more stability, but slower &#8220;fast&#8221; years.  I suspect that&#8217;s more due to the Fed (I&#8217;ve had plenty of posts on the real MS growth and real GDP per capita) than tax rates though.</p>

<blockquote><p>Winter weather has already arrived here, with temperatures dropping into the high 30s on some nights. But Li&#8217;s home in the 500-unit Flower Garden Apartments in a northern suburb of the capital has provided scant refuge from the growing chill. Instead, Li and an estimated 200 million of China&#8217;s poor have been forced to shiver as they mark off the days until Nov. 15 arrives. That&#8217;s when municipal managers switch on boilers, radiators and immersion heaters, firing up central heating systems that are a throwback to the Communist-planned economy of the 1960s.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even in Los Angeles, you get a variation of this.  It’s a bit warm today but my office is just boiling.  So I complain about them turning off the air conditioner – and they note this is just how it’s done in this office building after October 31.  I’m tempted to wear a tee shirt and shorts to the office tomorrow.</p>

                                <p>I keep asking and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve gotten an answer, so I&#8217;m going to ask again.   Are there any circumstances under which, a year from today, the Surge &#8211; heck, the whole Iraq enterprise &#8211; would not be considered a success?  I mean, short of Saddam crawling out of his grave and forcing men from Missouri to marry other men from Alabama (or worse, Wisconsin), is there anything that can possibly happen that would be a sign that perhaps things aren&#8217;t going well?  </p>
<p>We&#8217;re spending more than a billion a week, we&#8217;re arming and paying any number of groups of people who dislike us intensely (enough to shoot at Americans when the opportunity arises), at least 5% of the population has fled the country, a bunch more are internally displaced, who knows how many have died, and this seems to be enough for the cheerleaders to be doing a triumphal dance for the last month or so.  So I ask again&#8230; are there any circumstances under which we might reasonably conclude, a year from now, that things aren&#8217;t going well in Iraq?</p>

                                <p>ILSM sends a link to the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08168.pdf">GAO&#8217;s audit of the Public debt</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Federal debt managed by the Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) comprises debt held by the public and debt held by certain federal government accounts, the latter of which is referred to as intragovernmental debt holdings. As of September 30, 2007 and 2006, outstanding gross federal debt managed by the bureau totaled $8,993 and $8,493 billion, respectively. The increase in gross federal debt of $500 billion during fiscal year 2007 was due to an increase in gross intragovernmental debt holdings of $294 billion and an increase in gross debt held by the public of $206 billion. As Figure 1 illustrates, both intragovernmental debt holdings and debt held by the public have steadily increased since fiscal year 2003. The primary reason for the increases in intragovernmental debt holdings is the annual surpluses in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and Military Retirement Fund. The increases in debt held by the public are due primarily to total federal spending exceeding total federal revenues. As of September 30, 2007, gross debt held by the public totaled $5,049 billion and gross intragovernmental debt holdings totaled $3,944 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>During fiscal year 2007, interest expense incurred totaled $433 billion, interest expense on debt held by the public was $239 billion, and $194 billion was interest incurred for intragovernmental debt holdings.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>As of September 30, 2007 and 2006, gross debt held by the public totaled $5,049 billion and $4,843 billion, respectively (see Figure 1), an increase of $206 billion. The borrowings and repayments of debt held by the public increased from fiscal year 2006 to 2007. After Treasury took into account the increased issuances of State and Local Government Series securities, Treasury decided to finance the remaining current operations using more short-term securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>A quick aside&#8230;  what the heck is with this administration?  It seems whenever interest rates get really low, they run away from the opportunity to lock in those low rates.  Remembers how they retired the 30 year bond when rates were about as low as they could go, and brought the 30 year bond back when rates went up?  What sort of idiotic behavior is this?</p>
<p>Anyway, ILSM notes that <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/10/20071011-1.html">the budget deficit for the fiscal year ending in September</a> is now projected at &#8220;just $163 billion&#8221;.  </p>
<p>ILSM raises a question I cannot answer&#8230; how can the debt rise by $500 billion, debt held by the public rise by over $200 billion, and the deficit be $162 billion?</p>
