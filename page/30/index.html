<p>Wrong v. Mark Steyn Wrong</p>
<p>Every so often I come across one or another columnist or tv personality making some</p>
<p>Steyn&#8217;s latest!  ( <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/337490/obamacare-s-other-shoe-mark-steyn">Mark Steyn</a> )<br />
<blockquote>If you had buttonholed me in the Senate men’s room circa 2003 and told me that a decade hence Joe Biden would be America’s vice president, John Kerry secretary of state, and Chuck Hagel secretary of defense, I’d have laughed and waited for the punch line</p></blockquote>
<p>I get it.  Steyn is telling us his powers of prognostication are very poor.  Its commendable, albeit odd, of him to warn his readers, but we should check to make sure it is more than false modesty on his part. Since  he discusses his forecasts circa 2003, let&#8217;s check that out. What was he writing circa 2003?  This <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3589977/Movers-and-shakers-have-moved-on-to-the-next-disaster.html">article</a> is one of the first things that comes up in a Google search of Mark Steyn&#8217;s writings from 2003, and the first with any forecasts.  It begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>On to the next quagmire! Don&#8217;t get mired in the bog of yesterday&#8217;s conventional wisdom, when the movers and shakers have already moved on to new disasters. America may have won the war but it&#8217;s already losing the peace! Here&#8217;s your at-a-glance guide to what the experts who got everything wrong last week will be getting wrong next week</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds promising, doesn&#8217;t it?   Here is his first point:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Iraq&#8217;s slide into violent anarchy&#8221; (Guardian, April 11). Say what you like about Saddam, but he ran a tight ship and you didn&#8217;t have to nail down your nest of tables: since the Brits took over, Basra&#8217;s property crime is heading in an alarmingly Cheltenhamesque direction. MBITRW (Meanwhile Back In The Real World): A year from now, Basra will have a lower crime rate than most London boroughs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s see&#8230; a year and nine days after this article appeared, a series of car bombs went off in Basra.  74 people were killed, over 100 injured.  Just like the East End, Mark Steyn might say.  And since we&#8217;re talking about the British, here are a few entries from a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14546763">BBC</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14546763">timeline</a> looking at the rest of the country:</p>
<blockquote><p>2004 March &#8211; Suicide bombers attack Shia festival-goers in<br />Karbala and Baghdad, killing 140 people.</p>
<p>2004 April-May &#8211; Shia militias loyal to radical cleric Moqtada Sadr<br />take on coalition forces.</p>
<p>Hundreds are reported killed in fighting during the month-long US military siege of the Sunni Muslim city of Falluja.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But back to Basra, and a story in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/06/AR2007080601401.html">Washington</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/06/AR2007080601401.html">Post some years later</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But &#8220;it&#8217;s hard now to paint Basra as a success story,&#8221; said a senior U.S. official in Baghdad with long experience in the south. Instead, it has become a different model, one that U.S. officials with experience in the region are concerned will be<br />replicated throughout the Iraqi Shiite homeland from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf. A recent series of war games commissioned by the Pentagon also warned of civil war among Shiites after a reduction in U.S. forces.</p>
<p>For the past four years, the administration&#8217;s narrative of the Iraq war has centered on al-Qaeda, Iran and the sectarian violence they have promoted. But in the homogenous south &#8212; where there are virtually no U.S. troops or al-Qaeda fighters, few Sunnis, and by most accounts limited influence by Iran &#8212; Shiite militias fight one another as well as British troops. A British strategy launched last fall to reclaim Basra neighborhoods from violent actors &#8212; similar to the current U.S. strategy in Baghdad &#8212; brought no lasting success.</p>
<p>&#8220;The British have basically been defeated in the south,&#8221; a senior U.S. intelligence official said recently in Baghdad. They are abandoning their former headquarters at Basra Palace, where a recent official visitor from London described them as &#8220;surrounded like cowboys and Indians&#8221; by militia fighters. An airport base outside the city, where a regional U.S. Embassy office and Britain&#8217;s remaining 5,500 troops<br />are barricaded behind building-high sandbags, has been attacked with mortars or rockets nearly 600 times over the past four months.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I think we can safely say that either Steyn is woefully ignorant of British crime statistics, or we can safely say his first forecast in his article was spectacularly wrong.</p>
<p>Steyn moved on:</p>
<blockquote><p>2) &#8220;The head of the World Food Programme has warned thatIraq could spiral into a massive humanitarian disaster&#8221; (Australian, April 11). MBITRW: No such disaster will occur, any more than it did during the mythical &#8220;brutal Afghan winter&#8221; and its attendant humanitarian scaremongering. </p></blockquote>
<p>Steyn must have been disappointed that the <a href="http://www.who.int/disasters/repo/15107.pdf">World Health Organization was still &#8220;scaremongering&#8221; a year later</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Insufficient food intake endangers the  nutritional status of a large part of the population increasing morbidity and mortality due to communicable diseases. </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.who.int/hac/crises/irq/background/Iraq_Health_in_Iraq_second_edition.pdf">A lot</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As indicated before, the situation of food safety seems to be serious. In three quarters of districts, the local manufactured food stuff did not meet the standard specifications. In more than half of the districts there were imported food products which were considered unfit for human consumption. A survey conducted, by the<br />MOH, on food processing factories revealed that only 58% complied with food safety regulations.</p></blockquote>
<p>And perhaps you remember <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;cad=rja&#038;ved=0CDIQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2004%2FWORLD%2Fmeast%2F04%2F01%2Firaq.contractor%2F&#038;ei=RZz6UMDEG-We2wX96oD4BQ&#038;usg=AFQjCNGqH40IjcUws2SUXJuU-mnu-3mvrw&#038;sig2=5yEp_CcX4GIv8KRj0oR1XQ&#038;bvm=bv.41248874,d.aWM">this story</a>  from 2004:</p>
<blockquote><p>Blackwater Security Consulting &#8212; whose four employees were viciously killed and their corpses mutilated by a mob in Fallujah, Iraq &#8212; is one of a growing number of private security contractors that are hiring veterans for jobs previously assigned to<br />the military.</p>
<p>Those jobs include the protection of personnel working for private companies and non-government organizations in Iraq.</p>
<p>They provide very focused security for detailing out how a protectee&#8217;s day occurs &#8212; from the beginning of the morning until they tuck that person back into bed at night,&#8221; said CNN national security analyst Ken Robinson, &#8220;whether that be an NGO trying to conduct operations trying to provide food or water or support to the<br />population.</p>
<p>The four men killed Wednesday were providing security for a convoy delivering U.S. government food.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus combining Steyn&#8217;s predictions 1 and 2 together in a medley of wrongness.</p>
<p>As a bonus, Steyn mentioned the food situation in Afghanistan. Clearly when he wrote this piece, he didn&#8217;t realize there are different kinds of predictions.  One type involves absolute statements:  &#8220;X will happen&#8221; or &#8220;Y will not happen.&#8221;  Examples<br />include:  &#8220;A year from now, Basra will have a lower crime rate than most London boroughs&#8221; or &#8220;No such disaster will occur.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there are statements that call for action, that either flat out state or imply &#8220;If we don&#8217;t act, then Z.&#8221;  I&#8217;m guessing the World Food Program&#8217;s worries about the food situation in Afghanistan fall under the latter category.  Here&#8217;s a story from <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=23200#.UPfaySfEyVo">2007</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>WFP aims to supply over half a million metric tons of food<br />to 6.6 million people in Afghanistan yearly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this is also just like London&#8217;s East End in Steyn&#8217;s version of reality.  And it seems that a decade later, the World Food Program is <a href="http://www.wfp.org/stories/preparing-winter-wfp-distributes-food-afghan-mountain-villages">still delivering food to Afghanistan.</a></p>
<p>So where are we at?  2 forecasts thus far, of which 2.5 of them wrong. (Yes, I do think he deserves to be dinged for the bit about Afghanistan.)</p>
<p>Steyn continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>3) &#8220;Iraqis Now Waiting for Americans to Leave&#8221; (AP, April 10). MBITRW: There will be terrible acts of suicide-bomber depravity in the months ahead, but no widespread resentment at or resistance of the Western military presence.</p></blockquote>
<p>A year later, though, the situation looked like <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2004-04-28-poll-cover_x.htm">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But while they acknowledge benefits from dumping Saddam a year ago, Iraqis no longer see the presence of the American-led military as a plus. Asked whether they view the U.S.-led coalition as &#8220;liberators&#8221; or &#8220;occupiers,&#8221; 71% of all respondents say &#8220;occupiers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>No doubt to Steyn, the Iraqis meant &#8220;occupiers&#8221; in a positive way.<br />With ponies.  And unicorns.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the multiethnic Baghdad area, where a Gallup Poll last summer of 1,178 residents permits a valid comparison, only 13% of the people now say the invasion of Iraq was morally justifiable. In the 2003 poll, more than twice that number saw it as the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Americans regard their men and women in uniform as liberators who are trying to help Iraq. But the Iraqis now see them as a threat and focus their anger on them.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they pass by on the street, we are curious, so we go out to look and they immediately point their gun at you,&#8221; says Muia, the bicycle shop owner.</p>
<p>Except for the Kurds, such feelings are widely held. For example:</p>
<p>Two-thirds say soldiers in the U.S.-led coalition make no attempt to keep ordinary Iraqis from being killed or wounded during exchanges of gunfire.</p>
<p>58% say the soldiers conduct themselves badly or very badly.</p>
<p>60% say the troops show disrespect for Iraqi people in searches of their homes, and 42% say U.S. forces have shown disrespect toward mosques.</p>
<p>46% say the soldiers show a lack of respect for Iraqi women.</p>
<p>Only 11% of Iraqis say coalition forces are trying hard to restore basic services such as electricity and clean drinking water.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our talley on Steyn&#8217;s forecasts:  3 forecasts made, 3.5 big forecasting errors.</p>
<p>Steyn&#8217;s next forecast reads like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>4) &#8220;If Saddam is not found dead, or caught alive, it will be the worst of all possible closures for the war against Iraq. Bin Laden himself continues to elude capture&#8221; (Roland Flamini, UPI) MBITRW: Obviously, it would be preferable if the late Saddam&#8217;s future media appearances were confined to guest-hosting Good Morning, Hell! with Osama. But if he&#8217;s reduced to bin Laden&#8217;s current schedule &#8211; mailing in bi-monthly audio cassettes of Islamist boilerplate &#8211; what&#8217;s the difference? Even if he&#8217;d escaped to Syria, he&#8217;d be spending the rest of his days as a Bedouin goat-herd. Right now, Boy Assad is doing his best not to attract Rummy&#8217;s attention.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steyn gets this one right &#8211; Saddam didn&#8217;t play much of a role from that point forward.</p>
<p>So, four forecasts, 3.5 errors, 1 successful forecast.</p>
<p>Moving on to Steyn&#8217;s next forecast:</p>
<blockquote><p>5) &#8220;Iraq was a new country cobbled together from several former Ottoman provinces, its lines drawn by the Europeans&#8221; (Mark Mazower, Independent, April 7). It&#8217;s a phony state, you can never make a go of it. MBITRW: There&#8217;s nothing in the least bit &#8220;cobbled&#8221; about it. The three Ottoman vilayets of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra have been<br />bound together by geography and trade for millennia. As a coherent jurisdiction, it makes more sense than, say, Belgium. As long as you respect its inherently confederal nature, it&#8217;ll work fine: think St Kitts and Nevis writ large.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I understand it, the Iraqi constitution allows Iraqi Kurdistan to maintain its own military forces (the Peshmerga) and does not allow the military from the rest of Iraq to operate in Kurdish territory. So far, so &#8220;confederal&#8221; to quote Steyn.  But ten years on, there are still <a href="http://www.defence.pk/forums/arab-defence/220273-peshmerga-iraqi-army-clash-12-iraqi-soldiers-died.html">armed clashes between Kurdish and Iraqi forces with people getting killed</a>.  Sometimes they&#8217;re <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2012/11/iraqi-kurdish-army-clashes-end-but-tensions-remain-high.html">&#8220;misunderstandings&#8221;</a>, sometimes they&#8217;re territorial grabs, but one thing is certain:  the two forces remain <a href="http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurds/5011.html">eyeball to eyeball.</a></p>
<p>This is less St. Kitts and Nevis than Pakistan and India during a<br />particularly hot period.</p>
<p>Score &#8211; 5 forecasts, 4.5 errors, 1 success.</p>
<p>Steyn&#8217;s error roll rolls on:</p>
<blockquote><p>6) &#8220;Turkey is concerned that a Kurdish capture of Kirkuk could help bankroll moves to establish an independent Kurdistan&#8221; (AFP, April 9). MBITRW: Nothing to worry about. The Kurds are the only part of the indigenous population that were part of the liberation force from the start. They&#8217;re not going anywhere now. They&#8217;ll settle for<br />being Scotland or Quebec rather than Pakistan.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back to the whole &#8220;Kurdish forces clashing with the Iraqi military thing.&#8221; Unless things have picked up in Scotland or Quebec, Steyn gets this one wrong.  But I&#8217;ll give him half a point on a technicality &#8211; the Turks aren&#8217;t all that concerned that the Iraqi Kurds are formenting revolt in Turkish Kurdistan right now, largely because of the Iraqi Kurdish stand-off with the Iraqi military.  Actually, even that&#8217;s not true &#8211; here&#8217;s a story from <a href="http://www.almonitor.com/pulse/security/01/10/iraq-ejects-turkish-armed-forces.html">late 2011</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Already tense relations between Turkey and the Iraqi central government have now become critical following a decision made by Baghdad. Following the Turkish government’s request for parliamentary approval of cross-border operations by the Turkish military, Baghdad has decided to not to allow the Turkish army to enter Northern Iraq and to maintain its presence there.</p>
<p>In a meeting yesterday [Oct. 2], the Iraqi cabinet decided to annul all agreements that enabled the presence of foreign troops in Iraq. The decision will directly affect Turkey, which has been maintaining bases in Northern Iraq since the 1990s. Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh announced the move: “The government has decided to refuse the presence of foreign troops and bases on Iraqi soil. No foreign soldiers will be allowed to enter Iraqi territory. The government has advised the parliament to annul existing agreements and not to extend them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And how&#8217;s that going now?  Well, <a href="http://www.al%20monitor.com/pulse/politics/2012/10/kurds-reject-malikis-demand-to-control-pesherga-militia.html">the Turks are still there</a> (and the Iraqis are still at it with the<br />Kurds):</p>
<blockquote><p>Maliki described the objections to the formation of the Tigris Operations Command as “unconstitutional, because the federal army has the right to have a presence in Basra or Zakho, and no one has the right to prevent it constitutionally. There are implicit<br />intentions and a lack of desire for the federal authority to have control or a presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that the army “is more [entitled] than the Turkish troops to have a presence [in Iraq’s Kurdish region].”</p></blockquote>
<p>So giving half a point to Steyn and marking half a point against him is exceedingly generous,</p>
<p>That&#8217;s six forecasts, 5 errors, 1.5 successes.</p>
<p>Next:</p>
<blockquote><p>7) &#8220;Rather than reforming the Muslim world, the conquest of Iraq will inflame it&#8221; (Jeffrey Simpson, Toronto Globe and Mail, April 10). MBITRW: Effective immediately, Palestinian suicide bombers are no longer subsidised by Baghdad; in Jordan, the Saddamite boot is off the Hashemite windpipe; Syria is under notice to behave. Despite the best efforts of Western doom-mongers to rouse the Arab street, its attitude will remain: start the jihad without me.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one he got right.  The Arab Spring came way later.</p>
<p>Seven forecasts, 5 errors, 2.5 successes.</p>
<blockquote><p>8) &#8220;Looting is always unsavoury. Let&#8217;s hope the Americans don&#8217;t pilfer the oil&#8221; (Brenda Linane, Age of Melbourne, April 11). MBITRW: The pilfering of Iraq&#8217;s oil has just ended. Saddam parcelled his country&#8217;s wealth out to those companies willing to cosy up to him. The oil business will now be opened up to competitive tender. The only North American politician with a personal stake in any of this is not Bush, Cheney or any of their Texan oilpatch pals, but the Prime Minister of Canada, whose daughter is married to TotalFinaElf&#8217;s biggest shareholder. The liberation of Iraq is a victory for real markets over French cronyism.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not sure anyone can know enough about the oil situation right now, except to say that the Kurds seem to be signing their own deals with oil companies which the Iraqi central government say is illegal. Depending on how one looks that, it could be &#8220;pilfering&#8221; or not.  I&#8217;ll give that one to Steyn rather than get into the weeds.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s eight forecasts, 5 errors, 3.5 successes.</p>
<p>Continuing.</p>
<blockquote><p>9) &#8220;Weapons of Mass Destruction. Remember them? Not a single one has yet been found&#8221; (Bill Neely, ITV, April 10). MBITRW: Actually, I almost wish this one were true. Anything that turns up now will be assumed to have been planted. If I were Washington, I&#8217;d consider burying anything I found. After all, an America that feels no need to bother faking justifications for invasion would be far more alarming to most Europeans. Instead, horrible things will turn up, but will never be &#8220;conclusive&#8221; enough for the French, who&#8217;ve got all the receipts anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not even sure what this means.  Best I can say, the &#8220;I almost wish this one were true&#8221; means Steyn feels WMDs were found.  I think we have to ding him for it.</p>
<p>With nine forecasts, he has 6 errors and 3.5 successes.</p>
<p>Saving the best for last, Steyn tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>10) America is already losing the peace. MBITRW: In a year&#8217;s time, Iraq will be, at a bare minimum, the least badly governed state in the Arab world and, at best, pleasant, civilised and thriving. In short: not a bad three weeks&#8217; work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the painted schoolhouses, I think even Steyn would admit this one was wrong putting him at 7 bad forecasts, 3.5 good forecasts.  Two bad forecasts for every good one.  Random guesses would have seriously outperformed the forecasts he made with such smug assurance on a topic on which, judging from Google,  Mr. Steyn felt qualified to expend a lot of ink.  And, don&#8217;t forget, we began with his admission that his ability to guess what is likely to happen in the US is completely off too.</p>
<p>Which raises the question &#8211; Steyn is a popular, very well paid columnist.  Is there anything on which he has pontificated in the past on which he&#8217;s been proven largely right?</p>

<p>I will pass over the gender confusion of &#8220;female congressman&#8221; and note that  the congressperson in question is Rep.

The results were buoyed by strong trading and investment banking results. The firm&#8217;s conference call is at 10:30 a.m.</p>
<p>JPMORGAN PROFIT JUMPS 53% JPMorgan Chase reported a record profit of $5.7 billion for the fourth quarter, up 53 percent from the period a year earlier. Revenues were also strong, rising 10 percent to $23.7 billion. The results were bolstered by a surge in mortgage lending.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Even though, for most people, the housing crisis is a thing of the past, the fight over who should bear the cost of sloppy and openly fraudulent mortgage origination and securities sales continues to grind through the courts.</p>
<p>We’ve written now and again about mortgage putback cases, which are also called representation and warranty, or “rep and warranty” litigation. Investors in mortgage-backed securities were not quite as dumb as the crisis aftermath had made them look. The sponsors of the securitizations made promises in the offering documents (called representations and warranties) about the quality of the loans. It turns out they lied.</p>
<p>Normally, when a loan is found to be worse than the sponsors promised, the remedy is a putback. The originator is required to take the bad loan back and replace it, either with cash or buy replacing it with a loan that was of the quality that the investors were promised. However, the mortgage securitizations put hurdles in front of the investors: it took a minimum level of investors (usually 25%) to demand putbacks and it was hard for any investor to know who else had bought a particular deal. Even then, the trustee (who was the party who was responsible for putting back the loan) almost always ignored and fought investor putback requests. They have ongoing relationships with the sponsors, so they don’t want to ruffle big meal tickets, plus the margins for acting as a mortgage securitization trustee are thin, so they don’t lift a finger unless they absolutely have to&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>But if the city and its residents are desperate to keep the Coyotes in town, they have to understand that doing so comes at a cost that likely won&#8217;t be replaced &#8212; not by sales tax revenue, not by economic growth, and not by outside spending. When the city subsidizes hockey, it reduces its ability to pay for public safety officials, public transportation, and services upon which its citizens rely.<br />That&#8217;s a choice the city is free to make, of course, but it shouldn&#8217;t pretend that the mere presence of the Coyotes is an economic investment. Doing so simply enables a further transfer of public dollars to a private enterprise, without much hope for a return.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suppose there is a difference between a corn field and a stadium, and I think Costner didn&#8217;t ask for special loans and tax status.   But a thrity year loan is not as flexible as jobs.</p>

<p>Oakland was no different, laying off 200 police officers, despite the city having the fifth-highest crime rate in the country. However, the city chose to fire those officers while <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-20/oakland-pays-17-million-for-nfl-raiders-as-cops-get-cut.html">preserving a $17 million payment</a> to the National Football League’s Oakland Raiders and Major League Baseball’s Oakland Athletics:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Oakland, California, the fifth-most crime ridden city in America, faced a $32 million budget deficit last year. It closed the gap by dismissing a fourth of its police force, more than 200 officers.</strong><br /><strong>Untouched was the $17.3 million that the city pays to stage 10 games a season for the National Football League’s Oakland Raiders and to host Major League Baseball’s Athletics in the O.co Coliseum.</strong> The funds cover debt financing and operations and are supplemented by $13.3 million from surrounding Alameda County, based on data compiled by Bloomberg from public records. </p></blockquote>

<p>Paul Krugman is Wrong about the Rise of the Robots  <a title="http://econfuture.wordpress.com/2013/01/18/paul-krugman-is-wrong-about-the-rise-of-the-robots/" href="http://econfuture.wordpress.com/2013/01/18/paul-krugman-is-wrong-about-the-rise-of-the-robots/">http://econfuture.wordpress.com/2013/01/18/paul-krugman-is-wrong-about-the-rise-of-the-robots/</a> </p>
<p>Paul Krugman has recently taken a keen interest in the rise of robots and automation — an issue that I have been focusing on since the publication of my book on this subject back in 2009.</p>
<p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/is-growth-over/">In a recent post</a>, Krugman says the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Smart machines may make higher GDP possible, but also reduce the demand for people — including smart people. So we could be looking at a society that grows ever richer, but in which all the gains in wealth accrue to whoever owns the robots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there is a fundamental problem with this way of thinking: as jobs and incomes are relentlessly automated away, the bulk of consumers will lack the income necessary to drive the demand that is critical to economic growth.</p>
<p>Every product and service produced by the economy ultimately gets purchased (consumed) by someone. In economic terms, “demand” means a desire or need for something – backed by the ability and willingness to pay for it. There are only two entities that create final demand for products and services: individual people and governments. (And we know that government can’t be the demand solution in the long run). Individual consumer spending is typically around 70% of GDP in the United States.</p>
<p>Of course, businesses also purchase things, but that is NOT final demand. Businesses buy inputs that are used to produce something else. If there is no demand for what the business is producing, it will shut down and stop buying inputs. A business may sell to another business, but somewhere down the line, that chain has to end at a person (or a government) buying something just because they want it or need it.</p>
<p>This point here is that a worker is also a consumer (and may support other consumers). These people drive final demand. When a worker is replaced by a machine, that machine does not go out and consume. The machine may use energy, resources and spare parts, but again, those are business inputs—not final demand. If there is no one to buy what the machine is producing, it will get shut down. Think of on industrial robot being used by an auto manufacturer. The robot will not continue running if no one is buying cars.*</p>
<p>So if we automate all the jobs, or most of the jobs, or if we drive wages so low that very few people have any discretionary income, then it is difficult to see how a modern mass-market economy can continue to thrive. (This is the primary focus of my book, <em>The Lights in the Tunnel</em>).</p>
<p>There is plenty of evidence that consumers are already struggling with the structural shift occurring in the economy. The years leading up to the current economic crisis were, of course, characterized by people consuming on the basis of debt rather than income. <a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2013/jan/15/more-workers-are-raiding-retirement-accounts-to/">A just-released report</a> shows that an ever increasing number of Americans are raiding their retirement accounts to pay current bills.</p>
<p>Does Paul Krugman really believe that it is possible to have a “society that grows ever richer” while a tiny number of robot owners hoover up more and more of total income — and the jobless masses consume the output by running up their credit cards or cashing in their 401(k)s?</p>
<p>The point is that the robot revolution is not just about income inequality. It will ultimately impact the sustainability of economic growth.</p>
<p>Innovation requires the existence of a market. New ideas will not receive the necessary backing if investors do not anticipate healthy market demand. A future with a dearth of viable consumers will be a far more zero-sum future. It will mean less of the type of innovation we associate with Steve Jobs — and more of the type you would find at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>One of the main points I make in my book is that I think we will ultimately have to treat the market itself as a kind of renewable resource. Jobs and wages have historically been the primary mechanism that redistributes income (and purchasing power) from producers back to consumers. Widespread reliance on robots and automation may ultimately cause that mechanism to break down — and that will be a threat to continued prosperity.</p>
<p>So what is the solution? In the long run, I think there will be no alternative except to implement direct redistribution of income. One possibility is a guaranteed minimum income funded by more progressive taxes (on the robot owners), and possibly by other sources (for example, a carbon tax).</p>
<p>It goes without saying that implementing such a solution would be an enormous social and political challenge. And it will intertwine with the other major problems we face. Meaningful action on climate change, for example, will become even more difficult in world where much of the population is increasingly focused on individual income continuity.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, responding to the impact that accelerating technology has on the job market could turn out to be one of the defining challenges for our generation.</p>
<p>* Not all robots are used in production, of course. There are also consumer robots. If you own a toy robot, it may “consume” batteries. However, in economic terms, YOU are the consumer — not the robot. You need a job/income or you won’t be able to buy batteries for your robot. Robots do not drive final consumption — people do.</p>

                                <p>From <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jan/15/east-coast-sandy-storms-obama-scientist">The Guardian</a> comes this news:</p>
<blockquote><p>Marcia McNutt, who last week announced her resignation as director of the US Geological Survey, told a conference that Sandy had left coastal communities dangerously exposed to future storms of any size.</p>
<p>&#8220;Superstorm Sandy was a threshold for the north-east and we have already crossed it,&#8221; McNutt told the National Council for Science and the Environment conference in Washington. &#8220;For the next storm, not even a super storm, even a run-of-the-mill nor&#8217;easter, the amount of breaches and the amount of coastal flooding will be widespread.&#8221;</p>
<p>McNutt, a professor of marine geophysics, was careful to preface her public remarks by saying she spoke as a scientist and not an Obama Administration official. But the unusually stark warning from a departing Obama official indicates the challenges ahead in protecting American population centres from the extreme storms of a changing climate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before Sandy, someone asked me what my <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/scienceofclimatechange">climate change</a> nightmare was. Before Sandy, I said it was that with the extra energy in the atmosphere-ocean system it feeds super storms that intersect mega-cities left rendered defenceless by rising seas,&#8221; McNutt said in a brief interview following her public remarks. &#8220;That is where we now are.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
