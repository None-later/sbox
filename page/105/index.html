                                <p>In a recent <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-american-conservative-extractive-elites-and-macro-corruption.html">post</a> I spoke with astonishment and admiration of an <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/chinas-rise-americas-fall">article/post</a> by Ron Unz in the May issue of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Conservative">The American Conservative</a></em> (he’s the publisher) that laid out a realistic, fact-based, cogent, and coherent portrait of our current economic situation. (I also pointed out that he 1. couched the post in an odd and unnecessarily tangential framing, vis-a-vis China, and 2. ignored what I consider to be the most obvious causes of that situation — thirty years of “conservative” economic ascendancy and the resulting empowerment/engorgement of the financial industry).*</p>
<p>I’ve been reading <em>TAC</em> regularly since then (yes: I’m <em>way</em> behind the curve on this), and I think it’s great. These guys fully understand that the dominant Republican/Conservative rhetoric is radical, specious, contrary to reality, and ignorant, blind to, or completely dismissive of the most basic facts on the ground — the stark, simple realities of economic history.</p>
<p><a href="http://unz.org/">Here’s</a> a guy who likes historical fact.</p>
<p>They understand that today’s so-called “conservatives” are anything but conservative. I could talk economics and politics with them over drinks without wanting to shoot myself in the head in the first twelve minutes. These are Edmund Burke/Dwight David Eisenhower conservatives. <em>We could work with these people</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, I think they still skew their causal interpretations in ways that ignore what seem to me to be patent realities, but they’re not the intentionally blind and/or shameless cherry-pickers, fact-distorters, and logic-contorters that comprise the whole Republican power structure — all the way from the base to Boehner (and decidedly including a large cohort of top-credentialed academic economists).</p>
<p>Speaking of Boehner, here’s a great example by <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/author/scott-galupo/">Scott Galupo</a> – a <em>TAC</em> contributor, former staffer for Boehner, and former staff writer for the Sun Myung Moon-founded (and decidedly righty) <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Times">Washington Times</a>.</em><br /><em><br /></em><br /><a href="http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/scott-galupo/2011/11/01/ronald-reagan-practiced-keynesian-economics-successfully">Ronald Reagan Practiced Keynesian Economics Successfully – (usnews.com)</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not completely taken with this piece. He pretty much skirts the fact that Bush I and Clinton policies embodied exactly the responsible Keynesianism that he recommends (as do I) and that Reagan practiced (to some debatably greater or lesser degree) — pull back on stimulus, raise taxes as needed, and trim deficits in the good times, putting money in the bank for the bad times. And he definitely doesn’t mention how well those Bush I and (especially) Clinton policies seem to have worked out for economic growth. But still: he’s nowhere near the asylum that is modern mainstream “conservatism.”</p>
<p>So here’s a loud shoutout to <em>The American Conservative, </em>and to others of similar stripe (all of whom have been excommunicated or ignored by the Palin paleos and their nutjob nabobs). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Frum">David Frum</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Bartlett">Bruce Bartlett.</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Buckley_(novelist)">Christopher Buckley</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reihan_Salam" title="Reihan Salam">Reihan Salam</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Manzi_(political_commentator)">Jim Manzi</a>. (My gentle readers can undoubtedly list more.) Give them your links, your &#8220;likes,&#8221; and your Google love. (Damn, I might even subscribe.) Talk to them. If we ever manage to emerge from the political and economic morass delivered unto us by the modern Republican party, these people and others like them are likely to be leading the way — in our direction.</p>
<p>* I was somewhat put out that Ron linked to my post in a <a href="http://www.ronunz.org/2012/05/07/when-half-a-million-americans-died-and-nobody-noticed/">followup</a> as if my comments were unequivocably approbative, ignoring what I think were important criticisms. But hey.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Following up on some work I did a while back (<a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/capital-in-the-american-economy-since-1930-kuznets-revisited.html">Kuznets Revisited: Investment in the American Economy Since 1929</a>), I got curious about what consumption has looked like in America over the last 80 years.</p>
<p>I’ll give you the results first, as a proportion of output, or GDP, followed by explanation and discussion. Click for larger.<br /><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/US-consumption-to-output.png"><img alt="" height="328" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/US-consumption-to-output-480x328.png" title="US consumption to output" width="480"></a></p>
<p><strong>Thinking About Consumption</strong><br /><strong></strong>This all requires some explanation. First off, when I use the word “real” herein, it doesn’t mean “inflation-adjusted.” It means real-world, nonfinancial. In national-account-speak, all consumption and investment spending is about purchases of real goods and services — things that are produced and consumed. Financial “goods” or “assets” — which aren’t/can’t be consumed by humans — aren’t even part of the accounting. (We’re “inside” the NIPAs.)</p>
<p>Next: when you hear economists talk about “consumption,” they’re almost always talking about something somewhat different: consumption <em>spending. </em>Definition: purchases, within a period, of goods and services that are consumed within that same period. (If the period you’re looking at is long enough, everything is consumption. If it’s short enough, everything’s investment — breakfast is an investment in the afternoon’s work. I’ll just talk about one-year periods here to keep things simple.)</p>
<p>But in any period, we’re also consuming stuff that was produced in the past, and so is not included in measures of consumption spending. We’re depleting inventories (these fluctuate up and down over the years, sort of a buffer stock), but more importantly we’re consuming real, long-term productive assets by using them, and through the inevitable decay of time (and obsolescence — a tricky technical accounting issue that I won’t explore here). When you run a drill press you’re using it up. You’re <em>consuming</em> it. It’s even true of living in your house. Absent maintenance and remodels, it eventually becomes a worthless heap of rotting lumber; you’ve consumed its value by living in it.</p>
<p>This is accounted for in the national accounts as Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC).* (Fixed capital is broken down into equipment, software, and structures, and structures are further broken down into residential and non-residential. Consumer durables — cars and refrigerators — aren’t included in fixed capital because it would require national accountants to model households as production centers).</p>
<p>But even with that big C-word at the beginning of its name, economists rarely include CFC as part of “consumption.” In the national accounts you’ll find it accounted for as part of investment — Gross Investment minus CFC is Net Investment, or the net amount added to our national horde of fixed assets. (When you hear macroeconomists talk about investment, it’s almost always shorthand for “gross investment.”)</p>
<p>So: Consumption of Fixed Capital is <em>not</em> spending<em>, </em>but it <em>is </em>(actual, if estimated) consumption<em>.</em><br />I was wondering how much of our real output we actually consume each year, so I added CFC to consumption spending to get what I’ll call Gross Consumption (with <em>Net</em> Investment being the remainder of national spending).**</p>
<p>Coming back to the graph, we see:</p>
<p>• A denominator-driven spike in these measures during the depression (GDP plummeted).</p>
<p>• A rapid decline in the pre-war and war years driven by 1. rising GDP and 2. a massive temporary increase in government consumption spending. (Factoid: In just seven years 1940-1947, government’s share of national consumption spending went from 13% to 39% and back to 16%.)</p>
<p>• A steady period of relatively low consumption from the late 40s until the mid 70s or early 80s (depending which measure you look at).</p>
<p>• Consuming an increasingly large portion of our national output since the late 70s/early 80s — with Gross Consumption just shy of 100% ’08-’10.</p>
<p>(The timing of the 70s/80s breakpoint is somewhat unclear because of the high and variable inflation of that period, which had a significant impact on estimates of capital consumption. Changed amortization and depreciation schedules, applied against the whole existing stock of fixed assets, results in significant moves.)</p>
<p>The depression and war years are pretty to easy to understand. What’s interesting here is the trend change since the 70s/80s. That change is not generally driven by more rapid capital consumption: that’s been pretty steady over the decades (though business capital consumption has accelerated as the capital proportions have shifted from longer-lived structures to more rapidly depreciating hardware and software):<br /><img alt="" height="328" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image001-480x328.jpg" title="investment" width="480"></p>
<p>You can see that in the first graph as well; the two lines have moved pretty much in synch.</p>
<p>So the long-term trend change for the nation as a whole is simply toward more consumption spending and less investment spending. That may seem obvious to some, but it’s nice to know it for sure.</p>
<p>It’s the same 70s/80s inflection point and secular shift that we see in so many other measures, especially various measures of economic growth (pointed out repeatedly by so many, notably on Angry Bear by Mike Kimel, <em>moi</em>, Jazzbumpa, and others, and serving as the impelling premise of Tyler Cowen’s <em>The Great Stagnation</em>).</p>
<p>I can think of a dozen different explanations, interpretations, and rhetorical riffs off of this three-decade trend. While most have a perjorative and pessimistic import, not all do. Perhaps we’ve gotten better at supply-chain management, so we require an ever-smaller buffer stock of real stuff relative to consumption and output. Or maybe we don’t need as much productive stuff — as it’s measured in dollar terms in the national accounts — to produce the same dollar-denominated quantities for consumption.</p>
<p>These strike me as pretty charitable and speculative explanations, though. The most obvious interpretation is suggested by the title of this post: we’re consuming more and more of our seed corn (and tractors), leaving less for future consumption and production (and growth). That may be true, or it may be simplistically reductive.</p>
<p>For the moment I’ll leave that determination to my gentle readers, and simply leave you with a long-term view of what seems to be an important and not-widely-discussed measure — Gross Consumption — describing how our economy has been operating over the last eighty years.</p>
<p>* I really wish they said “fixed assets” instead of “fixed capital,” because economists are so profoundly confused about what “capital” means. (Many seem to think that fixed “capital” and financial “capital” are equally parts of some synonymous, homogenous, or vaguely contiguous undifferentiated blob.) Many everyday folks are equally confused about “assets,” but most economists seem to understand at least dimly that real (or at least fixed) assets and financial assets are decidedly different things that can’t be thought about, analyzed, or modeled in the same ways. The key in discussion is to <em>always</em> specify what type of assets or capital you’re talking about, especially differentiating between financial and real (with fixed being a subset of real that happens to be fairly easily measurable by totting up money transactions).</p>
<p>** Here ignoring the trade balance for the moment; we purchase 3 or 4% more than we produce these days — part consumption spending, part investment spending — because <em>in toto </em>we import more than we export. Don’t be confused by the GDP = Production = Expenditures = Consumption Spending + Investment Spending = Income identity; that’s only true in a closed economy.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In the comments on my recent <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/home-work-gdp-and-family-values-its-nice-to-be-validated.html">Home Work, GDP, and Family Values</a>, which discusses a recent <a href="http://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pdf">study</a> (PDF) on the subject, Saturos <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/home-work-gdp-and-family-values-its-nice-to-be-validated.html#comment-4878">points</a> to <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/06/two_improper_co.html">this Arnold Kling post</a> replying to a <a href="http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2012/05/household-production-levels-and-trends.html">Timothy Taylor post</a> summarizing that study.</p>
<p>Saturos thinks Arnold’s post is “excellent.” I think otherwise.</p>
<p>Arnold says “the value of household production” is an “improper concept to measure.” His reasoning:<br />
<blockquote>Should you measure the value of the deck by multiplying the number of hours I spend on it times the wage rate of a professional carpenter? If the carpenter takes 40 hours and I take 4000 hours, then you want to tell me that my deck is 100 times more valuable?</p></blockquote>
<p>So it’s “improper to measure” this concept because Timothy suggests the wrong wage rate to be used in the measurement/estimate. (Be Very Clear Here: <em>all</em> of the national accounts values are estimates, some more firmly grounded than others.)</p>
<p>I agree that the value of home production shouldn’t be estimated based on what a professional would charge for the same work; that makes no sense. The median wage — what I suggested in my post — does, especially since we’re talking in terms of aggregate national amounts. This completely ameliorates the problem that Arnold’s objection is based upon (basically, normalizing for “utility” and market value) — perhaps not perfectly but very effectively, estimating based on dollar-denominated, market-determined values.</p>
<p>But Arnold seems to want to do much more than correct the estimate. He wants to make off-limits any estimates of productive work not involving monetary exchange. It’s “improper” to even <em>measure </em>the concepts. They’re not just hard to estimate; they’re <em>wrong</em> to estimate.</p>
<p>Discussions of proper methods and targets for national accounting go way back. You’ll find them in spades in Kuznets (basically the father of modern national accounting) as far back as <a href="http://www.nber.org/books/kuzn46-2">1946</a>. For an excellent overview of the history and issues, see Jorgensen and Landefeld’s 2004 <a href="http://www.nber.org/CRIW/CRIWs04/jorgenson.pdf">Blueprint for an Expanded and Integrated Set of Accounts for the United States</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Three snippets from that fine work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Simon Kuznets, one of the primary architects of the U.S. accounts, recognized the limitations of focusing on market activities and excluding household production and a broad range of other non-market activities and assets that have productive value or yield satisfaction. The need to better understand the sources of economic growth in the post-war era led to the development—much of it by academic researchers—of various supplemental series, such as investments in human capital.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Kuznets (1946), favored development of a much broader set of welfare-orientated accounts that would focus on sustainability and address the externalities and social costs associated with economic development.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Work by Nordhaus and Tobin (1973), among others, on adjusting traditional economic accounts for changes in leisure time, disamenities of urbanization, exhaustion of natural resources, population growth, and other aspects of welfare produced indicators of economic well-being.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to avoid imputing normative objectives to Arnold’s objection. If you outlaw measurement of things that are not represented by money transactions, you essentially outlaw discussion of utility (or, the equivalent: pre-assume that one dollar always and everywhere equals one “util”). This avoids the need to perceive some obvious implications of Textbook Economic Concepts like declining marginal utility, which tells us that transferring money from the rich to the poor, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, creates utility out of thin air.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t even dream of saying that Arnold makes these kinds of assertions to please his masters at Mercatus. (No names, just initials: Koch.) But I have no qualms saying that if he didn’t make these kinds of assertions, he wouldn’t have ended up there. <em>See</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent:_The_Political_Economy_of_the_Mass_Media">Manufacturing Consent</a>.</p>

<p>New Report Highlights Flaws of North Carolina Mega-Incentives </p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">new report</a> for the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center, <i>Special Deals, Special Problems&#8211;An Analysis of North Carolina&#8217;s Legislature-Approved Economic Development Incentives</i>, has just been published. It covers a range of issues I&#8217;ve emphasized here before as well as some basic considerations reporters really need to pay more attention to.    </p>
<p>North Carolina has some of the best economic development practices in the country, in terms of <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">online transparency</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">performance requirements</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">use of clawbacks</a> for non-performance by companies, sunset clauses for tax expenditures, hard caps for many tax credit programs (see my report on these points), etc. The state publishes an <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">economic development inventory</a> I consider to be of very high quality and consistent with international definitions of a subsidy. The most recent edition shows that in the 2008-9 fiscal year the state spent about $1.2 billion on economic development, enough to hire 24,000 people at $50,000 a year in wages and benefits.    </p>
<p>At the same time, however, the state has persistently had problems in overvaluing potential investments and consequently offering wildly excessive subsidies for them. The best known case is <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">Dell in 2004</a>, when Virginia offered the company a $37 million incentive package, while the state and local bid from North Carolina came to almost $300 million on a nominal basis ($174 million present value). Other deals discussed in the report are Google ($260 million nominal value, $140 million present value), Apple ($321 million over 30 years nominal value, no present value calculation available), and a provision in a 2011 special incentives bill to allow Alex Lee Inc. to keep $2 million it should have forfeited for not keeping job promises. This last case illustrates how special legislative deals weaken the state&#8217;s performance requirements; this case will make future companies think that there may be no penalty for non-performance.    </p>
<p>Reporters take note! This publication describes useful techniques for comparing the size of incentive packages regardless of project size or payout period of the incentive. From the European Union I borrow the term &#8220;aid intensity,&#8221; which measures the size of the incentive relative to the amount of the investment or the number of jobs created. The idea is that a $1 million incentive would be large for a call center but a rounding error for an automobile assembly plant. As a result, we need a standardized way of comparing incentives.    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>While in this country one can sometimes find cost per job analyzed for some subsidy packages, the EU actually uses the subsidy/investment metric as its primary measure of aid intensity. <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">In my last post</a> I discussed a mall redevelopment which could conceivably have an aid intensity of 96%. For comparison purposes, we should note that the highest aid intensity allowed for large firms anywhere in the European Union, is 50%, and that is only allowed in the poorest regions of the EU, mainly in eastern Europe. (Richer regions have lower allowable maxima.) A region&#8217;s maximum is cut by half for large projects over 50 million euro, and by 66% for spending over 100 million euro.    </p>
<p>The other important concept is present value, a familiar one to accountants and economists, but not widely understood among the general public. The basic idea is simple: receiving a dollar today is worth more than receiving a dollar next year, which is worth more than receiving a dollar in two years, etc. Since incentive packages can pay out immediately (with a cash grant) or over a period of 30 or more years, we need to use present value to properly compare the size of incentives with different payout periods. This requires finding a a &#8220;discount rate&#8221; by which to reduce future payments. We then use the present value as the numerator in calculating aid intensity to be able to compare across different sizes of projects.    </p>
<p>Using Google as an example, this $600 million project will receive $260 million over 30 years and create 210 jobs. As mentioned above, this is its nominal cost, before discounting the future dollars. Following the practice of a 1990s study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to compare subsidies among its then 23 members, I used a discount rate equal to the 10-year Treasury bond yield to come up with a present value of $140.6 million. Then the aid intensity is $140.6 million/$600 million, or 23%, and the cost per job at present value is $669,489.</p>
<p>We can then use these two measures of aid intensity to compare the incentive to that given for other projects and inform our judgment of whether it was a better or worse deal than other states have made, in the current context where states make such deals all the time. Of course, I believe there should be limits placed on state and local governments so we can sharply reduce net incentive spending, which has few national benefits&#8211;but that is a long time in the future.    </p>
<p>North Carolina provides an intriguing case study because it does so much right in economic development, but it makes special deals outside its statutory incentive programs. The result is high costs and weakened bargaining position in the future. It&#8217;s a case we can learn a lot from. </p>

<p>Heading into the Tuesday vote Mayor Barrett with ~$4million in election funds of which 26% is drawn from out of state sources faces off with the under siege Governor Walker having ~$30 million in funds with 2/3rds coming from out of state sources. Again the Koch Bros are kicking in with a sizeable contribution of $1 million as well as the multi-billionaire owner of the Sands, Sheldon Adelson, with another sizeable sum ($1 million?). The unions and citizens of Wisconsin are hard pressed to support Barrett in a similar fashion. So much for payroll wages versus corporate profits. Tuesday election may be a bellwether for the Democrats and the November elections as the 99-percenters and labor take on corporate interests and the &#8220;1-percenters&#8217; who are both investing heavily in Walker intending to sway the state into the Red column.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tuesday’s recall election of Republican Gov. Scott Walker is the most expensive in Wisconsin history. More than $63.5 million has been spent by candidates and independent groups, the overwhelming majority underwritten by out-of-state sources.</p>
<p>The record spending total was made possible thanks to the <em>Citizens United</em><i> U.S. Supreme Court decision — which had the effect of invalidating Wisconsin’s century-old ban on independent expenditures by corporations and unions — and a state law that allows unlimited contributions to the incumbent in recall elections.&#8221; <a href="http://www.iwatchnews.org/2012/06/03/9039/wisconsin-recall-breaks-record-thanks-outside-cash" target="_blank">Election a national referendum on public sector unions</a></i></p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Having amassed a sizeable war chest directly resulting from United Citizen&#8217;s opening the donation flood gates for corporate interests and a state law allowing recalled Governor Walker unlimited contributions, Walker has a slight lead and is favored to win. While this may end the recall efforts by angered unions and others, Walker&#8217;s troubles may not be over as he faces indictment over fundraising efforts by aides and his choice for Lieutenant Governor Brett Davis. There is quite a bit of speculation how this will all play out and it is not the first time the former Milwaukee County Executive has found himself in trouble for questionable activities.</p>

                                <p>Uwe E. Reinhardt offers his viewpoint on trends in US health spending.  Following are excerpts from two articles in the NYT&#8217;s <i>Economix  </i>concerning the costs of our system and how they are apportioned in the big picture, and the impact on family budgets.  Reading the charts is actually important.</p>
<p>There are trends in our health care system that are in place and that providers are responding to, making the regulation process only part of the bigger story. </p>
<p><a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/the-fork-in-the-road-for-health-care/" target="_blank">The Fork in the Road for Health Care</a><br />
<blockquote>For 2012, the nationwide average of the total health spending for a typical family of four was estimated by Milliman to be $20,728. On a regional basis, that average varies from a low of $18,365 in Phoenix to $24,965 in Miami.</p>
<p>A just-released <a href="http://www.healthcostinstitute.org/2010report">study</a> by the <a href="http://www.healthcostinstitute.org/about">Health Care Cost Institute</a> shows that much of these spending increases are the result of rising prices and not of rising use. <a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2012/May/21/higher-health-care-prices-hospitals.aspx">Reporting</a> on the study, Julie Appleby of Kaiser Health News notes,</p>
<blockquote><p>Higher prices charged by hospitals, outpatient centers and other providers drove up health-care spending at double the rate of inflation during the economic downturn – even as patients consumed less medical care over all. </p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>The chart below shows the path of the Milliman Medical Index since the year 2000. Although the increase of “only” 6.9 percent between 2011 and 2012 was the lowest since Milliman started publishing the index 12 years ago, a 6.9 percent increase is nevertheless alarming in a period when gross domestic product per capita and the gross wages of employees rise at much lower rates.<br />… </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Although the family’s contribution of $8,584 is by no means trivial, it is less than half of the total average cost of a family’s health care cost. Most employees probably believe that “the company” – that is, its owners – absorbs the other 58 percent of the family’s total health spending. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Economists have long argued that <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/22/is-employer-based-health-insurance-worth-saving/">this is an illusion</a> – that over the longer haul the bulk and possibly all of the ostensibly employer-paid health insurance premiums gets indirectly shifted back into the employee’s paycheck through lower increases in take-home pay. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>To the extent that there is a limit to this cost shift – e.g., for low-wage or unionized employees — the backward shift takes the form of reduced employment or, alternatively, the employer’s decision not to offer employees health insurance at all. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This point on backward cost-shifting was driven home recently in <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/9/1630.full.pdf+html?sid=9515d36c-2263-4f8f-8621-567526900940">a paper</a> in Health Affairs by David Auerbach and Arthur Kellerman. The authors present data showing that a decade of health care cost growth in employer-based health insurance “has wiped out real income gains for an average U.S. family” from 1999 through 2009. Health care has come to chew up American household budgets like <a href="http://www.thepcmanwebsite.com/media/pacman_flash/">Pacman</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/is-u-s-health-spending-finally-under-control/" target="_blank">Is US health spending finally under control?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Charts 1 and 2 show the growth of health spending from 1965 to 2010, broken down by source of payment. Chart 1 exhibits the time path of actual health spending, not adjusted for inflation. Chart 2 exhibits the percentage of total national health spending contributed by the various sources in the chart. In the charts the green area denotes out-of-pocket spending at the time health care is consumed, the red private health insurance, the gray Medicare, the yellow Medicaid and the blue “other third-party payments.”</p>
<p>Economists would explain such a trend as flows: as the fraction of G.D.P. devoted to health care increases, the added satisfaction, or utility, that people derive from added health care is likely to diminish relative to the added satisfaction derived from consuming more of other things. It could explain a gradual decline in the excess growth of health care spending.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Usually I describe the employment report as disappointing. But this one was just miserable.</p>
<p>Private sector employment only rose 69,000 and the unemployment rate ticked back up from 8.1%to 8.2%.</p>

<p>On a positive note, the household survey showed a gain of 422,000 and generally this series tends to lead the payroll data.</p>

<p>But the average work week fell from 33.5 to 33.4.  In combination with the weak employment increase this generated a significant drop of 0.2% in aggregate hours worked.  This reversed the recent strengthened in the index of hours worked as it fell back below the trend for this cycle.</p>

<p>Average  hourly earnings rose less than 0.1% from $23.39 to $23.41.  The year over year gain is back to an all time record low of 1.39% </p>

<p> With the drop in hours worked, average weekly earnings fell $806.96 to $805.30.  </p>

<p>The unemployment rate rose for almost every category of workers.  One of the exception was a fall in the unemployment rate for college graduates.</p>

The link is to the transcript via Alternet.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;coverage is so successful because it accurately describes a campaign finance world that seems too surreal to be true.  A system that claims to require disclosure of money spent to elect or defeat candidates, but in fact provides so many ways around that requirement as to make disclosure optional; a system that says that “independent expenditures” cannot be limited as a matter of Constitutional law because they cannot corrupt because they are “totally independent” of candidates and parties—&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Beverly Mann points us to a June 14 date for SCOTUS review of the case:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s a link to a SCOTUSblog article from yesterday laying out the Court&#8217;s timeline and options concerning how they&#8217;ll proceed in the Montana case. They&#8217;re expected to decide on June 14 whether to simply summarily reverse the Montana Supreme Court without briefing and oral argument, or instead to agree to decide the case after full briefing and oral argument next term:  <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/05/montana-detainee-cases-set/" target="_blank">http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/05/montana-detainee-cases-set/</a>.  I expect them to do the latter. But, who knows?</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/" target="_blank">Jared Bernstein</a> writes on the same points on why people move to other states and taxes as <i>Steve Roth</i> and <i>Linda Beale</i> address in their posts today and gives us <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/8-4-11sfp.pdf" target="_blank">this evidence</a>  (hat tip rjs):</p>
<ul>
<li>Migration is not common.</li>
<li>The migration that’s occurring is much more likely to be driven by cheaper housing than by lower taxes.</li>
<li>Recent research shows income tax increases cause little or no interstate migration.</li>
<li>Low taxes can prevent a state from maintaining the kinds of high-quality public services that potential migrants value.</li>
</ul>
<div>Also highlighted are the sources of several of the &#8216;sources&#8217; of such claims demonstrated as bogus from media claims.  </div>
