<p><strong>Are Wisconsin Public Employees Over-Compensated?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Wisconsin public employees are not overpaid: The earnings equation estimates indicate that state and local government employees in Wisconsin are not overpaid. Rather, local and state public employees are undercompensated. When we make comparisons controlling for education, experience, hours of work, organizational size, gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship, and disability, both state and local public employees earn lower wages and receive less in compensation (including all benefits) than comparable private sector employees.</p>
<p>A standard earnings equation produces what some may consider a surprising result: full-time state and local employees  are undercompensated by 8.2%. We observed, however, that public employees work fewer hours, particularly employees with bachelor’s, master’s, and professional degrees. An earnings equation controlling for work hours of full-time employees demonstrates that Wisconsin public employees earn 4.8% less than comparable private sector workers working comparable annual hours. <a target="_blank" href="http://epi.3cdn.net/9e237c56096a8e4904_rkm6b9hn1.pdf">EPI</a><br /><a name="more"></a><br />WI public employees are underpaid by ~4.8% when compared to the private sector.  Knight at Naked Capitaism kept insisting the bill would not remove collective bargaining. Technically, he is correct. </p>
<p><strong>Who the bill impacts and how it impacts them</strong>:</p>
<p>&#8220;General municipal, county, and school employees (except police and fire), and school boards and local governmental units may only bargain over &#8220;total base wages.&#8221; Health insurance, pension, vacation, holidays, hours of work and any other conditions of employment (promotions, evaluations, safety, grievance/arbitration procedures and just cause standards for discipline) will be prohibited subjects of bargaining.&#8221;  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aft-wisconsin.org/SaveCB/Walker%20Bill%20Analysis.pdf">PROPOSED CHANGES TO MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEE BARGAINING RIGHTS MUNICIPAL EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS ACT</a> UNDER CH. 111.70 [MERA]</p>
<p>The police and Fire Departments supported Walker so they are not subject to this bill.</p>
<p><strong>Unions did offer up concessions</strong>:</p>
<p>&#8220;This afternoon, Marty Beil, executive director of the Wisconsin Public Workers Union, sent a message to the Governor’s office agreeing to the cuts to pension &#038; welfare benefits sought by Walker in his bill.  The governor’s response was “nothing doing.”  He wants the whole kit and kaboodle – the end of the collective bargaining rights of the public unions.&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.forbes.com/rickungar/2011/02/18/koch-brothers-behind-wisconsin-effort-to-kill-public-unions/">Koch Brothers Behind Wisconsin Effort To Kill Public Unions</a>, Forbes Magazine</p>

<div><strong>Going Galt in 2011 – I Guess Atlas Shrugs Was Right</strong><br /><em>crossposted at the </em><a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=368" target="_blank"><em>Presimetrics blog</em></a><em></p>
<p></em>A couple years ago, there was a small spate of commentary of folks by conservatives and libertarians about how, if the Bush tax cuts weren’t renewed, we’d see a bunch of highly productive people <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2009/03/rightbloggers_s_1.php" target="_blank">going Galt</a>. In other words, a whole bunch of people on whom society depends, seeing the parasites started sucking even more of their lifeblood, would simply withdraw from society… and the rest of us would suffer.</p>
<p>It turns out that those who gave us these warnings were partly right. It seems there are a lot of people – schoolteachers, firefighters, police officers and the like – threatening to go Galt in Wisconsin these days. Its just that the rest of the story isn’t playing quite the way the promoters of going Galt predicted. Nevertheless, I’m sure they must be absolutely ecstatic that some people have finally stood up to the government and said: “enough is enough.”</div>

                                <p>Uwe Reinhardt&#8217;s post the other day, &#8220;<a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/18/how-convincing-is-the-case-for-free-trade/">How Convincing is the Case for Free Trade?</a>&#8220;, helped to kick-start a fair bit of discussion recently about the impact of international trade on the US economy. <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/02/should-losers-from-free-trade-be-compensated.html">Mark Thoma</a> and <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2011/02/should-losers-f.html">William Polley </a>have shared their thoughts about the importance of compensating the losers from trade, while others (e.g. <a href="http://timworstall.com/2011/02/19/on-the-distribution-of-the-gains-from-trade/">Tim Worstall</a>) have questioned that need.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to add 3 points to this discusssion.</p>
<p>1. International trade is not substantially different from trade between two people within the same country. Both types of trade are voluntary agreements between the two parties to the transaction. And both types of trade may negatively impact other people in the economy who had nothing to do with the transaction. The main difference is simply that with international trade, the transaction happens to cross an international boundary.</p>
<p>2. Just because trade leads to an efficient outcome, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a good outcome. I think that <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/free-trade-efficiency-and-punch-in-nose.html">a parable about a punch in the nose</a> helps make that point. But even very bright economists often confuse &#8220;efficient&#8221; with &#8220;good&#8221;.</p>
<p>3. I see the problem of adequately compensating the losers from international trade as just a part of the larger question of how we treat people in our society who, through no fault of their own, have fallen on hard times. International trade is just one of the many enormous, inexorable forces that constantly reshape our economy. Technological change, demographic change, or the fluctuations of the macroeconomic business cycle may devastate millions of families each year just as surely as international trade. An important measure (to me) of the type of society we live in is how we treat those individuals who are on the losing end of those impersonal economic forces that, in the long run, often help to make the world a more prosperous place.</p>

From <strong>rortybomb</strong> at the link above:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fight in Wisconsin is over <a target="_blank" href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf">Governor Walker’s 144-page Budget Repair Bill</a>. The parts everyone is focusing on have to do with the right to collectively bargain being stripped from public sector unions (except for the unions that <a target="_blank" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2011/02/scrooge-ism_in_wisconsin_part.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">supported Walker running for Governor</a>). Focusing on this misses a large part of what the bill would do. Check out this language, from the same bill (my bold):</p>
<p><strong>16.896</strong> Sale or contractual operation of state−owned heating, cooling, and power plants. (1) Notwithstanding ss. 13.48 (14) (am) and 16.705 (1), the department may sell any state−owned heating, cooling, and power plant or may contract with a private entity for the operation of any such plant, <strong>with or without solicitation of bids, for any amount that the department determines to be in the best interest of the state</strong>. Notwithstanding ss. 196.49 and 196.80, no approval or certification of the public service commission is necessary for a public utility to purchase, or contract for the operation of, such a plant, and <strong>any such purchase is considered to be in the public interest and to comply with the criteria for certification of a project under s. 196.49 (3) (b).</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The bill would allow for the selling of state-owned heating/cooling/power plants without bids. This excellent catch is from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ginandtacos.com/2011/02/21/stand-and-deliver/">Ed at ginandtacos.com</a> (who, speaking of Madison, took me to the Essen Haus on my 21st birthday, where the night began to go sideways). Ed correctly notes:</p>
<p>&#8220;If this isn’t the best summary of the goals of modern conservatism, I don’t know what is. It’s like a highlight reel of all of the tomahawk dunks of neo-Gilded Age corporatism: privatization, no-bid contracts, deregulation, and naked cronyism. Extra bonus points for the explicit effort to <strong>legally redefine </strong>the term “public interest” as “whatever the energy industry lobbyists we appoint to these unelected bureaucratic positions say it is.”</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to think of this battle as a larger one over the role of the state. The attempt to break labor is part of the same continuous motion as saying that the crony, corporatist selling of state utilities to the Koch brothers and other energy interests is the new “public interest.” </p></blockquote>

                                <p><em>Crossposted at <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/">The Street Light</a>.</em></p>
<p>David Wessel shows us the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/02/18/the-federal-fiscal-issue-in-one-chart/">federal fiscal issue in one chart</a>. The chart depicts an estimate of what the Obama administration&#8217;s budget proposal would mean for spending in each major category over the next five years. &#8220;The bottom line: Spending on interest, Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security go up – a lot. Spending on nearly everything else goes down.&#8221;</p>
<p>I prefer looking at it slightly differently. I think that when trying to understand the federal government&#8217;s fiscal situation, at least on the spending side, it is more informative to see how we got to where we are. </p>
<p>We now have an on-budget (i.e. excluding the Social Security program, which continued to run a surplus in 2010) deficit of about 9% of GDP. In the early 2000s, the budget deficit was about 4-5% of GDP. That&#8217;s deterioration in the on-budget deficit of about 4-5% of GDP between 2003 and 2010.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Now take a look at the following chart, which shows federal spending on actual goods and services broken into two pieces: spending related to defense, and spending related to everything else. Then I&#8217;ve added federal spending on the two Meds: Medicare and Medicaid. (Note that this latter category is actually a transfer payment, not spending by the government on goods and services, since it takes the form of the government reimbursing individuals for medical spending that THEY have done.)</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n2hrDUdZyjs/TWKGQZVMa9I/AAAAAAAAAYk/rTOWfnQf9K0/s1600/fed%2Bspending%2Bby%2Bcategory1.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n2hrDUdZyjs/TWKGQZVMa9I/AAAAAAAAAYk/rTOWfnQf9K0/s400/fed%2Bspending%2Bby%2Bcategory1.PNG"></a><br />Defense spending has gone up about 2 percentage points since the early 2000s. Med+Med spending has gone up by about 2 percentage points since the early 2000s. All other federal spending has meandered feebly between 2% and 3% of GDP. That slight lift in the green line in the last two years is the &#8220;massive&#8221; stimulus, or put another way, what &#8220;out of control government spending&#8221; apparently looks like.</p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t for increased defense spending and the Meds over the past several years, the federal government&#8217;s budget balance would have been pretty close to unchanged. <em><strong>Despite the most severe economic downturn in 70 years.</strong></em></p>
<p>I say again: <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/yet-again-what-stimulus.html">what stimulus</a>?</p>
<p>UPDATE: To clarify, Social Security is not included in any of the measures shown in the chart above.  Social Security is classified as a &#8220;transfer payment&#8221;, not an actual purchase by the federal government of goods or services.  The red and green lines above only show &#8220;government consumption expendistures and gross investment&#8221;, as it&#8217;s described in the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm#gdp">National Income and Product Accounts</a>; transfer payments are excluded.  The blue line, on the other hand, does show a specific type of federal transfer payments: those related to health care.  I think it&#8217;s more helpful to leave SS out of this sort of discussion since it&#8217;s basically an independent, self-funded program, and is neither the cause of our budget problems, nor an important part of any solution.</p>

<p>[edited to correct typos and add link to CTJ and Leonhardt articles 2/19pm]</p>
<p>Kevin Hassett, an economic grunt at the American Enterprise Institute and frequent contributor to the Wall Street Journal op-ed pages, prepared a report for the institute on corporate taxation.  Guess what&#8211;it claims that the US overtaxes its corporations and that is the reason that we are losing jobs.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of things wrong with this report.</p>
<p>1) it disregards the impact of globalization on corporate decisions to move enterprises, and the fungibility of operations if jurisidictions left don&#8217;t make the exit a highly taxing moment.  It also disregards the lack of protection for US workers&#8211;yes, US workers are better paid than workers in undeveloped countries, and if multinational enterprises (MNEs) can merely substitute the one for the other, they will. </p>
<p>2) It first spends a lot of ink on the US statutory rate, complaining that it is higher than that of most other OECD countries.  That is true, but really meaningless in itself.  You can&#8217;t have a decent understanding of a country&#8217;s tax policies without looking at both tax rates and the base against which they are assessed.  Since the corporate tax base in the US has more holes than Swiss cheese, looking at the rate tells you almost nothing about the corporate burden.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>3) It notes that corporate taxes raise much less in revenue as a percent of GDP in the US than in other OECD countries.  Somehow, the report intends this to be an indictment of the US corporate tax system as overtaxing corporations.  I suppose the authors reach that by implying that corporations have fled the system and that&#8217;s why.  But it is really an indication that the thesis in the title of the report&#8211;that the US gets an F for bad taxes that are making US corporations uncompetitive&#8211;is wrong. The US has such a loophole riddled corporate tax system that corporations are easily able to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. IN fact, other countries have more effective tax systems that get more corporate taxes out of their corporations as a percent of GDP, so the US must be a tax haven.  It is rather surprising that we haven&#8217;t had an upsurge of grass-roots, tea party-style protests against all the big MNEs that manage to benefit mightily from the use of tax revenues (from roads to water to workers&#8217; comp to subsidized health care) yet pay next to nothing in taxes in return. </p>
<p>For some examples of these MNEs with low taxes and much use of benefits, see David Leonhardt, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/business/economy/02leonhardt.html">The Paradox of Corporate Taxes in America</a>, New York Times, Feb. 2, 2011 .  Leonhard points out that Carnival Corporation &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t have much of a business without help from various branches of government&#8221; from the Coast Guard to Customs to road building and bridges and port maintenance, but the biggest benefit mayh be the price it pays, since it has only paid total (federal, state, local and foreign) taxes over the last five years equal to 1.1% of its $11.3 billion in profits.&#8221;  Other major US corporations with substantial economic profits pay corporate taxes less than 10%&#8211;Yahoo (7%), Boeing (4.5%), Prudential Financial (7.6%).  Id.  (And wasn&#8217;t Prudential  one of the banks that got to use the Treasury&#8217;s ultra vires notice permitting banks that acquired other banks to use their losses without the strict limitation provided in the tax code section 382?)</p>
<p>4) It claims that the US corporations&#8217; effective tax rate is still way higher than for other countries.  To do this, it uses two formulaic calculations for effective tax rates, neither of which is particularly trustworthy as to actual effective tax rates. It finds that its two hypothetical measures of effective tax rates come out at 29% and 23.6%.  These are probably too high, but are considerably less than the statutory rate. it doesn&#8217;t, for example, look at the amount of actual taxes paid compared to the amount of taxable income reported.  That figure would suggest a higher effective rate than actually experienced, since taxable income is much less than economic income.  It doesn&#8217;t do what makes even more sense, look at actual <em>current taxes </em>paid as noted on financial statements of reporting companies compared to <em>economic income </em>as noted on financial statements of reporting companies.  That number would be fairly accurate, and in fact comes out very low indeed.  See, e.g., CTJ study, Revenue<a href="http://www.ctj.org/pdf/corporatetaxreform.pdf">-Positive Reform of the Corporate Income tax</a>, Jan 25, 2011 (noting that a Bush study in 2007 found only a 13.4% effective tax rate for 2000-2005, compared to a 16.1% rate for other OECD countries). </p>
<p>5)  In comparing US corporations&#8217; statutory taxes to those in other OECD coutnries, it takes into accout state and local corporate taxation (average) rates.  But note that the US has primarily corporate income taxes, while OECD countries may have a host of other taxes, including in most cases a substantial value-added tax system (VAT).  The report doesn&#8217;t bring that tax into the comparison.  As a result, its comparison is again meaningless, because it isn&#8217;t really comparing the overall tax burden to determine whether the US corporations are in fact paying tax haven rates or being stymied in competition. </p>
<p>6) And of course, these corporate excusers provide only the slimmest of rationales for asserting that the US is aided by improving the competitiveness of MNEs in other countries&#8211;usually along the lines that helping them invest more abroad will also have a spillover effect in terms of more investment here.  Actually if we help them succeed there by reducing taxes here, we are cutting off our noses to spite our face, since they will move operations there and do less here. We&#8217;d be much better off using that money to fund education and basic scientific research that can improve our quallity of life and give us new things to manufacture! </p>
<p>As usual with the AEI, the ideological agenda has resulted in a report that primarily serves a propaganda purpose.  I&#8217;d say that it isn&#8217;t US corporate taxes that get an F, but rather this AEI report!</p>

<p>If members of Congress feel so strongly about not doing anything about health care costs, perhaps we should stop providing them with health insurance. Let’s credit their pay for the amount that has been paid by the taxpayers, and let them try to buy health insurance in the individual market. (My bet is that they all would be denied).</p>

<p>There is concerted effort to portray Social Security as ruining the country by being a significant cause of the current deficit , and this is not accidental.  Social Security has been funded by payroll taxes that are supposed to be dedicated to the payouts.  But the GOP since Reagan has worked to cut income taxes and increase military funding (especially with the Bush &#8220;pre-emptive&#8221; wars of choice that Stiglitz now says will cost us a minimum of FIVE TRILLION), and has borrowed from those Social Security pension funds to pay for those tax cuts and military excesses. It&#8217;s the tax cuts and runaway military spending that are choking this country&#8217;s economy, not Social Security.  That fact gets lost unless Social Security&#8217;s income and outflows are portrayed fully.  It&#8217;s a fact that the GOP wants to be lost, I think, along with the overall amount of military and related spending in our budget.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The cost of treating Social Security as part of the deficit is that workers who have been locked out of sharing in productivity gains will pay, while the benefits have gone especially to the upper class that owns most of the financial assets and most of the military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>The deficit hype appears to be a concerted effort, in other words, to destroy the programs that were created in reaction to the colossal inequities that were contributory causes of the Great Depression and were intended to safeguard the broad-based society where growth is shared and everyone has opportunities that is essential to democracy.  I just found that Robert Reich has similar thoughts, noting that this is a divide-and-conquer strategy built on three kingpins:  the battle over the budget, the assault on public employees, and the distortion of the Constitution. See <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/02/18/robert_reich_republican_strategy/index.html">The Real Republican Strategy</a>, Salon.   What the GOP aims to do, I suppose, is to weaken the 90% who aren&#8217;t in the race to be the richest plutocrats of the country., and make sure that they secure the spoils for those at the top.</p>
<p>It would seem that the GOP is using this moment to</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get rid of programs that have advanced gender equality</strong>.
<ul>
<li>See Rebecca Traister, <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/abortion/index.html?story=/politics/war_room/2011/02/18/traister_speier_abortion">This is what pro-life means</a>?, Salon.com, Feb. 18, 2011, noting that &#8220;Morality is on the side of women, on the side of children, on the side of a society that offers aid to its impoverished and to its young and does not discriminate against half its population. In Moore&#8217;s words, &#8216;Planned Parenthood is healthy for women, it’s healthy for children, and it’s healthy for our society.&#8217; &#8221;  The post includes a video of Rep. Jackie Speier&#8217;s impassioned response to the lack of understanding about abortions.  </li>
<li>See, e.g., <a href="http://pol.moveon.org/waronwomen/?id=26177-3577895-L74IWLx&#038;t=3">Top 10 Shocking Attacks from the GOP&#8217;s War on Women</a>,  MoveOn&#8217;s political action group (noting the attempt by various state and federal Republican groups to reduce access to abortions and r;define victims of rape  (but not of other crimes like burglary) as mere &#8220;accusers&#8221;; expand legitimate &#8220;defense&#8221; to permit killing abortionists; cut funding for food and other assistance to low-income pregnant women and families; allow hospitals to refuse abortions necessary to save a woman&#8217;s life;    eliminate preschool programs for poor kids at state levels and Head Start at the federal level; cut funding for services for the elderly poor (most of whom are women); cut all funding for Planned Parenthood; cut all funding for family planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Get rid of public employee unions (and reneg on pension promises made years ago at the same time).</strong> The mainstream media has lapped this up like the lapdogs they are.  See, e.g., Wall Street Journal, New York Times stories.  
<ul>
<li>Gov. Walker in Wisconsin&#8211;the state where there is a pitched rhetorical battle to get rid of public employee unions and defund public pensions&#8211;die not inherit a budget shortfall.  Like at the national level, GOP policies are driving the attack on public employee more than the actual deficits involved&#8211;especially since those shortfalls at states are related to the toll of the Great Recession and to states&#8217; long-term habits of borrowing from Peter (their own employees&#8217; pension funds) to pay Paul (e.g., their other creditors or even their wealthiest taxpayers who were spared taxes by the borrowing).  See, for example, Mark Thoma at Economist&#8217;s View on <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/02/the-unrest-in-wisconsin.html">the spreading use of recession-induced budget gaps to target unions</a>. Gov. Walker has pushed the &#8220;tax cuts create jobs&#8221; idea, signing various business tax cuts into law. See Walker <a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/opinion/editorial/article_61064e9a-27b0-5f28-b6d1-a57c8b2aaaf6.html">Gins Up Crisis to Reward Cronies</a>, The Cap Times, Feb. 16, 2011;  <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/Misc/2010_01_27_MillerPocan.pdf">Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, annual review of the State&#8217;s Fiscal Status</a> (Jan 2010) ( even with the recession and various changes that caused the state to have less revenues, projecting a surplus of more than $55 million at the end of the 2009-2011 biennium which, though below the statutory surplus of $65 million required, means that the state was still doing well); <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/114944994.html">Walker Signs 2 More Business Incentive Bills</a>, Journal Sentinel, Jan. 31, 2011.  Exacerbating the shortfall created by the tax cuts, the state has about $260 million of unfunded obligations&#8211; from taking $200 million out of a dedicated fund for general fund purposes and from an unpaid obligation to Minnesota under a tax reciprocity agreement (an obligation that is earning interest at more than $4000 a day).  So the public employees aren&#8217;t the cause of the state&#8217;s problems.  </li>
<li>This is particularly worrisome for higher education.  See <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/02/14/wisconsin_governor_seeks_major_cuts_in_faculty_benefits_and_union_rights">Inside Higher Education story </a>on impact on Wisconsin academics.  These attempts to hit public employees generally start with some of the studies that suggest that public employees have better benefits than private employees.  As noted in earlier posts, that is debatable.  Commensurability is a problem, since many state and federal government jobs require higher education and experience levels.  Wages are negotiated  in exchange for better long-term benefits, which the states are now talking about reneging on.  It&#8217;s as though the private industry owners wrote the following script based on this &#8220;time to get even&#8221; rationale. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>for years, we have underpaid our workers while keeping all the productivity gains for ourselves and paying ourselves knock-out pension and health benefits. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve made sure that workers couldn&#8217;t unionize, by spending lobbying dollars to fight fair systems (like carch-check) and using all the powers of the employer to intimidate workers (see, e.g., Wal-Mart&#8217;s long history of unfair labor practices).   </p>
<p>Now it is clear that unions do benefit workers&#8211;just look at the fact that public employees have decent wages and benefits because they are able to bargain collectively with a decent employer that doesn&#8217;t use these methods to squelch workers. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got to stop that&#8211;let&#8217;s paint a picture of underpaid private workers who have very little in benefits, in order to incite jealousy of public workers. </p>
<p>Then we can use the deficit that we created by evading taxes, lobbying for tax cuts, and charging ridiciulous amounts for contracts through the military-industrial-banking complex to justify taking away both the benefits that public employees long ago gave up wages to receive and the collective bargaining rights that allowed them to get decent wages and benefits.</p>
<p>After all, the alternative would be for workers in our industries to realize that they&#8217;ve been cheated by not sharing in productivity and not being permitted to unionize. </p>
<p>We can&#8217;t have that&#8211;they might get some share of the wealth that has been increasingly accruing to us. </p>
<p>And we deserve all that wealth, because we&#8217;ve run our companies so well by making sure that they can&#8217;t unionize and that workers understand that they, not us, are expendable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hamstring or get rid of the EPA</strong> &#8211;The script here sounds very familiar.  We can&#8217;t have the EPA regulating carbon dioxide.  That would cut back on our profits.  So what if we are contributing the the rapidly accelerating global warming debacle.  We just can&#8217;t have environmental safeguards preventing us from making a killing (in more than one way) with oil and ore.  If we want to use highly toxic chemicals in fracturing rock to extract gas, we should be able to do it.  That&#8217;s the free market we believe in.  Free for us, risky for those who have to clean up after us (remember the Great Recession and TARP&#8211;same thing). </li>
<li><strong>Get rid of public broadcasting.</strong>  Public Broadcasting has provided a voice for diverse perspectives in local communities that otherwise are completely left out of commercial media for lack of the funding to buy a way in.  But that voice is not necessarily monotonal&#8211;it often has religious or conservative perspectives, but it also permits liberal or atheistic perspectives.  So call up the script again, which in this case might go something like this&#8211;hey, we&#8217;ve allowed media companies to consolidate so that most are owned by a very few media conglomerates (Rupert Murdoch, SONY, Sinclair, etc.).  That&#8217;s great for us, because it permits us to control the way things are cast.  Look at how Murdoch has made even the conservative Wall Street Journal a right-wing rag on our side&#8211;not just the op-ed pages anymore, but the way the stories are chosen and cast.  PBS, on the other hand, stillmanages to show some leftie stuff&#8211;even with the fear we&#8217;ve put into them with Ken Tomlinson and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting&#8217;s requirement of balance.  (We know that there isn&#8217;t always a right-wing side that&#8217;s worth covering, but no matter&#8211;they MUST adopt the Fox News view of &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; or funding will cease.  Better still, let&#8217;s just cease the funding anyway.  Bill Moyers and his ilk is a threat to every multinational corporation that is attempting to protect its hordes of cash from the US treasury by offshoring jobs and offshoring all intangible rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gail Collins notes the same mentality when she discusses the way Congress &#8220;saved&#8221; the Defense Department&#8217;s budget to sponsor Nascar racers.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/opinion/19collins.html">Sacred Cows, Angry Birds</a>, New York Times, Feb 19, 2011.  Yes, that&#8217;s right&#8211;Defense wanted to torpedo the funding, but Congress found it was too important to woo Nascar fans to the military-industrial complex way of thinking.  They refused to cutit. </p>
<p>The newly ascendant Republicans have been howling that the deficit is so big, so threatening, that no traget for cutting is sacred.  &#8220;Everything is on the table.  We&#8217;re broke,&#8221; said Boehner.</p>
<p>But the table is mainly crowed with stuff the Republicans didn&#8217;t like to begin with.  Family-planning money and environmental protection, but not oil tax breaks or Nascar sponsorships.  &#8220;Sesame Street&#8221; is fair game, ut the Dayton 500 is untouchable.</p>

<p>A Critique of Tyler Cowen&#8217;s The Great Stagnation, by way of Alex Tabarrok&#8217;s Criticism of Keynesian Politics</p>
<p>Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=357">Presimetrics blog</a> </p>
<p>Alex Tabarrok and Tyler Cowen are libertarian professors from George Mason University who post at the very popular <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/">Marginal Revolution blog.</a>  I often don&#8217;t agree with what they write, but its usually well reasoned and grounded in reality.  (Unlike, say, what comes up in a number of other libertarian blogs.)</p>
<p>Cowen recently wrote an e-book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1297984094&#038;sr=1-1">The Great Stagnation&#038;lt</a> I haven&#8217;t read it &#8211; I&#8217;m swamped these days.  However, there have been many reviews (and comments by Cowen himself, so I think I can provide a brief summary.  Essentially, Cowen notes that in the last few decades (since about the early &#8217;70s), real economic growth in the US has slowed.  (That won&#8217;t be a surprise if you read Presimetrics.)  His thesis is that this has to do with technological development &#8211; we&#8217;ve eaten the low hanging fruit, and further technological progress (and hence real economic growth) will be slow until we get off the plateau we&#8217;re on.  </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>It might seem unrelated, at first, but Cowen&#8217;s partner at Marginal Revolution, Alex Tabarrok, recently had <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/02/the-failure-of-keynesian-politics.html">written a post</a> that received some comment. Tabarrok argues that whether Keynesian economics can work or not (he does not believe it can &#8211; presumably he wouldn&#8217;t be a libertarian if he did), Keynesian politics has failed, in that it simply hasn&#8217;t been tried in this country, not during the two big economic disasters of the last 100 or so years:  the Great Depression and the Great Recession.  </p>
<p>Tabarrok is wrong &#8211; wrong that Keynesian economics hasn&#8217;t been tried, and wrong that it hasn&#8217;t worked.  And Cowen, it turns out, is wrong about exactly the same thing in his book.</p>
<p>The basic Keynesian idea is this:  economic downturns (and meltdowns) can occur and/or be prolonged and worsened when the private sector becomes worried and cuts back.  In those circumstances, the government should step in and buy things, lots and lots of things, replacing the shrunken private sector demand.  Once the economy picks up again, the government should cut back on its spending and start saving up money, first to pay for its recent spending bout and second to have cash in hand to cover its next necessary spending bout.</p>
<p>Put another way &#8211; a government thinking along Keynesian lines will tend to run a deficit when real private sector spending falls below some prior highwater mark.  It will run a surplus in years real spending exceeds prior real private sector spending.  There may, of course, be exceptions in any given year, but a Keynesian government will generally follow that sort of behavior.  A government that runs a deficit when real private sector spending is rising, or runs a surplus when real private sector spending is falling, and behaves this way in general is most definitely not operating under Keynesian principles.  </p>
<p>Which brings us to data.  Surplus and deficit information was computed using current federal gov&#8217;t receipts and expenditures from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=87&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2010&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaBox=no#Mid">BEA&#8217;s NIPA Table 3.2</a> Real private sector spending is made up of real &#8220;personal consumption expenditures&#8221; and real &#8220;gross private domestic investment&#8221; from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=6&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2010&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaB">BEA&#8217;s NIPA Table 1.1.5</a> Data goes back to 1929, the first year for which the BEA computed data.</p>
<p>The following graph may look a bit odd, since it has no curve on it.  But it shows something cool.  If I did this correctly, the gray bars show periods when:</p>
<p>1.  real private sector spending hit a new high and the government ran a surplus</p>
<p>2.  real private sector spending fell below a previous high and the government ran a deficit</p>
<p>Keynesian governments will generally behave in that way.  The turquoise bars show non-Keynesian behavior:</p>
<p>1.  real private sector spending hit a new high and the government ran a deficit</p>
<p>2.  real private sector spending fell below a previous high and the government ran a surplus</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what it looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AV0UFcuR_m0/TV_BxAgBWCI/AAAAAAAAAi4/_Sf8FePIWCM/s1600/greatstagnation.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AV0UFcuR_m0/TV_BxAgBWCI/AAAAAAAAAi4/_Sf8FePIWCM/s400/greatstagnation.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I get from this graph&#8230; from until some time around the late 60s or early 70s, US governments generally stuck to Keynesian policies and not incidentally, generally produced relatively rapid growth.  After that, the US government generally abandoned Keynesian policies and produced Tyler Cowen&#8217;s Great Stagnation.   I am not prepared on to comment on whether there has been technological stagnation though.</p>
<p>Perhaps the graph can be improved.  Its important not to consider individual years Keynesian or not, but rather overall behavior over a number of years.  For instance, the fact that the government ran a deficit during the recession in 1990 &#8211; 1991 doesn&#8217;t make it Keynesian behavior (though it does appear to have a gray graph) since it had been running a deficit already, even when times were good.  Running a deficit when times are bad is only Keynesian if you&#8217;re paying down debt  (i.e., running a surplus) when times are good.  The fact that the government has been running a deficit more or less continuously since the late 1960s (except for a brief period in the 90s) indicates that it definitely wasn&#8217;t following Keynesian economic theory &#8211; else it would be running surpluses when real private spending was up.
<p>Well, gotta run.  As always, if you want my spreadsheet, drop me a line.  I&#8217;m at my first name (mike) period my last name (one m only in my last name!!!) at gmail period com.  And don&#8217;t forget which post your writing about.  Toodle-oo, folks.  </p>
