                                <p>Free Trade,  Jobs, and Choosing<br />

<p>Reading the comments to Kash&#8217;s last post, and reading articles like <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/business/2235989">this one</a> in the Houston Chronicle, it&#8217;s clear that concern over lost jobs is the major reason for most anti-trade sentiment. However, free trade opponents need to understand that protecting jobs by restricting trade also costs jobs.  The recent steel tariffs, under which we saved jobs in Pennsylvania and <a href="http://www.detnews.com/2003/autosinsider/0311/11/a01-322245.htm">lost jobs in the auto industry</a> in Michigan, highlight this point: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The duties have cost steel users, such as Troy-based Delphi Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest auto parts maker, and Caterpillar, the largest earth-moving equipment maker, about $680 million, the Washington-based International Trade Commission said in September.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; If you keep those tariffs in place until 2005,&#8221; said Lopes, &#8220;perhaps (the steel industry) is in a better economic situation than before, but now your customers, if they&#8217;re small and medium size business, have shut down, and your bigger customers &#8230; have been forced to shift production overseas.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;The tariffs have been especially destructive to small auto suppliers that use specialty steels only available from foreign steel makers, said Neil de Koker, who heads the Original Equipment Suppliers Association in Troy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t pass that price increase onto their customers because they refuse to accept it,&#8221; said de Koker. &#8216;If they can&#8217;t pass it on, they&#8217;re dead.&#8221; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the face of either losing jobs in Michigan or losing jobs in Pennsylvania, how do we choose?(*)  With steel tariffs, we save jobs in Pennsylvania at the expense of jobs in Michigan; along the way, all Americans get to pay more for anything made out of steel or made using machinery that&#8217;s made out of steel (in other words, just about everything). If we instead choose free trade, then we preserve jobs in Michigan at the expense of jobs in Pennsylvania. However, in the process, all American get to pay less for things made out of steel and things made using equipment made out of steel. </p>
<p>Viewed in this light, the choice is obvious: free trade, which creates wealth, is better than restricting free trade, which destroys wealth.  (Note that by &#8220;wealth&#8221;, I mean national wealth, as in GDP, not wealth as in more money for rich people.) Jobs are going to be lost either way, but with free trade, a portion of the benefits can be allocated to job retraining, adult education, and unemployment insurance to help soften the losses in the affected industry. With restricted trade, there is less wealth to go around so there is less money, not more, available to spend on easing the burden of unemployed workers. </p>
<p>Finally, how are the benefits of free trade distributed? With the sole exception of workers in industries that lose jobs (and remember that jobs will be lost either way), the benefits go to people who sell, make, or buy stuff&#8211;meaning just about everyone. And, unlike most things in life, the benefits of free trade accrue in a progressive fashion. Free trade lowers the price of food, clothing, consumer electronics, and cars. Poor and middle class families spend the large majority of their income on just these goods; as family income rises, a smaller portion is spent on these goods. For example, <a href="http://www.thebta.org/keyissues/NAFTA/documents/FTAAKeyPoints.pdf">one study</a> estimates the savings due to expanded free trade under the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) at $814 for a family of four. That estimate is from FTAA advocates and may be high but whatever the true number is, the savings are about the same regardless of where a family lies in the income distribution. In percentage terms, this makes the benefits very progressive. For a family near the poverty line (about $16,000), saving $814 is a 5% reduction in the cost of living. For a family making $100,000, the same benefit amounts to a $.08% savings. (**)</p>
<p>It has always struck me as odd that people who oppose free trade are generally in favor of progressive policies. On the other hand, this gives me a new theory of why the Bush administration has been surprisingly anti-trade.</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>(*) With the current administration, the choice is easy: which state is closer to voting for Bush in 2004? Pennsylvania! Oh, then go with steel tariffs and screw the auto industry workers. That&#8217;s opportunism, not policy.</p>
<p>(**) The benefits are spread fairly evenly across the population even though the wealthy spend more on food, clothes, and cars than the poor, because as you move up the luxury scale a smaller amount of the total price of the good is attributable to the costs of inputs. A Corvette and an entry model Saturn use about the same amount of steel, so each car would be a few hundred dollars cheaper without steel tariffs.  In percentage terms, this is a noticeable benefit to Saturn buyers and a trivial benefit to Corvette purchasers. The same is true for high-end clothing and expensive meals.<br /></p>

                                <p><strong>Trade with China as Technological Revolution</strong></p>
<p>There have been some thought provoking comments recently about the US’s trade with China, and we haven’t had a good trade debate on here in a few months, so I thought I’d open up a thread to discuss it more fully.  Let me first stick out my pro-trade neck as a target, though. </p>
<p>Some people suggest that while trade with a country like China helps consumers, it hurts workers, and therefore can’t be good.  For some context, here’s a chart that shows the US’s trade with China over the past decade.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/china_tb2.jpg"></p>
<p>So how can economists so consistently assert that trade is good, if our imports from China continually grow and US workers lose their jobs as a result? Workers and consumers are the same people, after all.  Naturally, economists recognize that it doesn&#8217;t do people any good to be able to get goods cheaper if their incomes have fallen by even more.</p>
<p>But typically that&#8217;s not what happens: instead, trade causes overall incomes to rise in real terms.  There is a mountain of theoretical and empirical evidence to support that assertion.  True, incomes have been rising very little for the past 3 years (and may have fallen) – but that is due to the recession, and not to our imports from China.  </p>
<p>HOWEVER, there is an important qualification. While trade increases overall incomes, there are definitely winners and losers.  Some individuals are unambiguously hurt by trade – namely those that lose their jobs to foreign competition.  Others are helped by trade – namely those that keep their jobs and just get to enjoy lower prices, and those that get jobs that wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise existed in the export sector if it weren’t for increased world trade.  But there&#8217;s no getting around the basic reality that trade helps some people while it hurts others.</p>
<p>Does that mean that trade with China (or any other country) should be limited by government intervention?  No.</p>
<p>The reason is that international trade functions exactly like technological progress.  Essentially, by moving production to China, the US has discovered a new way to produce a lot of consumer goods more cheaply than before.  An invention that magically reduced the labor requirement for manufacturing consumer goods would have the exact same effect on the US economy – it would cost thousands of US manufacturing workers their jobs.  Increasing trade with China is no different from a technological revolution.</p>
<p>But, one might still ask, what about the winners and losers from trade?  Shouldn’t we still limit trade to help the losers?  Let me turn the question around.  What makes international trade any different from any other type of economic change – almost all of which create winners and losers?  When any new technology is invented there are winners and losers.  When the railroad was invented, thousands of people who worked on the canals and on ships lost their jobs to competition from the railroads – and many couldn’t find jobs in the railroads, since they required very different skills.  When the tractor was invented, one farmer could do what it used to take ten to do by hand, so millions of farmers who couldn’t compete against the tractor lost their jobs, and had to move to new industries.  Yet somehow the US economy still grew and propsered.</p>
<p>You get the idea.  My point is this: international trade causes the pattern of economic activity to shift, transform, and evolve in a different way from before – just as technological progress does.  If your goal is to try to prevent anyone from ‘losing’ as the economy evolves, banning technological progress would probably work much better than banning international trade.  But we don’t, because we know that technological progress makes us all better off in the long run.  So instead, we try to help the losers from economic change in other ways, such as by providing a secure social safety net.</p>
<p>So why do things seem worse right now?  That’s because the US economy is currently suffering from a prolonged (though relatively mild) economic downturn.  That makes it seem like there are more ‘losers’ than usual.  And there are.  The thing is, most of those additional ‘losers’ right now are losing from the recession, not from trade.  Even if we imported nothing from China, there would be more ‘losers’ right now.</p>
<p>One last point.  I’ve addressed why I think that imports from China simply make the US economy evolve faster, but what about the trade <em>imbalance</em>?  Does it matter that we buy a lot more from China than China does from the US?  The answer is yes, it matters in the long run, because the trade deficit means that the US must essentially give China (and other countries) our assets to pay for what we’re importing.  But, as I’ve discussed in posts <a href="http://www.angrybear.blogspot.com/2003_10_12_angrybear_archive.html#106613749639368269">here</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003_11_09_angrybear_archive.html#106875082680574962">here</a>, the cause of our trade imbalance is our low savings and high consumption, so limiting our trade with China wouldn’t help with that problem.  All it would do would be to limit the technological revolution that is currently transforming US manufacturing, one which will inevitably make the US more prosperous.</p>

                                <p><strong>The Resumption of The Big Dollar Slide?</strong></p>
<p>The US dollar hit a record low against the euro today, of about .83 €/$.  It’s been <a href="http://www.angrybear.blogspot.com/2003_11_02_angrybear_archive.html#106787615652886251">trending down</a> for the last year and a half, so that’s not that surprising.  But listen to what currency traders were <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/11/18/markets/dollar/index.htm">saying today</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Traders cited two factors behind the dollar&#8217;s fall. </p>
<p>First, Commerce Undersecretary Grant Aldonas told reporters that the Bush administration has decided to set new quotas on textile imports from China&#8230;  The timing of the measure seemed odd, given that the World Trade Organization just ruled that the United States&#8217; steel tariffs are illegal and given that Treasury Secretary John Snow said yesterday that the United States wasn&#8217;t headed into a &#8220;protectionist mode.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, that’s not surprising either – neither the Bush administration contradiction of its own economic team, nor the protectionism.  However, this definitely caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Second], the Treasury Department released figures showing that foreign investment in U.S. stocks and Treasurys slowed sharply in September &#8212; which pressures the dollar since there&#8217;s less apparent demand for U.S. assets. </p>
<p>Breaking down the numbers, foreign investors sold $6.3 billion worth of U.S. equities compared with $11.5 billion worth of equity purchases in August. They bought just $5.6 billion worth of Treasurys &#8212; down sharply from the $25.1 billion they bought the month before. </p>
<p>The drop off in Treasury buying was especially notable since the Japanese government reported that it bought $40 billion of the U.S. currency in September in its efforts to stem the yen&#8217;s strength. Much of that money would have gone into Treasurys. The suggestion is that some other country or countries were big sellers.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, which foreign country could plausibly have sold $35 billion in US Treasury bonds in one month?  Only one candidate immediately leaps to mind: China.  Given the gigantic stocks of US Treasurys that China owns, this news reminds me of some of my <a href="http://www.angrybear.blogspot.com/2003_08_17_angrybear_archive.html#106146421409229723">long-standing concerns</a> and makes me wonder if there isn’t worse to come in the months ahead for the dollar.</p>

                                <p><strong>Have We Passed the Cyclical Bottom?</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">CPI report for October</a> was just released this morning.  The core rate (which is the important rate to check if you want to understand the underlying trend in inflation) of consumer price inflation was up .2% last month.  That means that the 12-month core CPI inflation rate edged up from 1.25% to 1.30%.  With the exception of last May, that&#8217;s the first time we&#8217;ve seen the 12-month inflation rate rise in nearly 1 ½ years.  (See <a href="http://www.angrybear.blogspot.com/2003_10_12_angrybear_archive.html#106631151831610999">this earlier post</a> for a chart and a bit of context.)  Is it time to say that we&#8217;ve passed the bottom of the cycle?  The <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm">PPI report </a>from last week also showed a slight uptick in core prices last month&#8230;  So put that together with all of the good news on output lately, and one could start making the case that we’ve reached the bottom of the business cycle &#8212; <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003_11_09_angrybear_archive.html#106865023873818201">at least for now</a>.</p>

                                <p><strong>Bush to Comply with the WTO?</strong></p>
<p>Well, it looks like Bush may indeed lift the steel tariffs.  Many (most?) of the relevant parties in the administration have wanted to lift them for some time, but now it may happen. To emphasize the point, Senator Charles Grassley (an unusually sensible Republican from Iowa who chairs the Senate Finance Committee) apparently wrote Bush a letter suggesting that he remove the tariffs, according to <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B06A6CC6B-E850-46F2-830B-4C9986438EF1%7D&#038;siteid=mktw">CBS Marketwatch</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The purpose of the steel safeguard tariffs has therefore been met, but this has come at a heavy cost,&#8221; Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote in a letter to Bush dated Friday.</p>
<p>The quasi-judicial U.S. International Trade Commission &#8220;estimates that the steel safeguard tariffs have already cost U.S. businesses and workers over $680 million since their imposition,&#8221; Grassley added.</p>
<p>Bush is widely expected to lift the tariffs, according to administration sources speaking on condition of anonymity. But the president, who likes to make surprise announcements, has been guarded in the last few days about his intentions.</p></blockquote>
<p>US Trade Representative Bob Zoellick has begun laying the groundwork by saying things like &#8220;the polictical climate has changed since the tariffs were imposed&#8221; and &#8220;the tariffs have already done their job.&#8221;  So why will Bush now remove the tariffs, after all of this time?  A news item from <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rm/031114/trade_steel_usa_1.html">Yahoo</a> suggested one reason: </p>
<blockquote><p>Grassley&#8217;s letter gives the White House more ammunition for arguing it is lifting the tariffs for domestic reasons, rather than &#8220;buckling under&#8221; to the threat of EU retaliation.</p></blockquote>
<p>But I don’t buy this line of reasoning.  If the White House was looking for domestic reasons to remove the tariffs, they had plenty with the <a href="http://www.angrybear.blogspot.com/2003_09_21_angrybear_archive.html#106414399659420164">ITC report back in September</a>.  Plus, why remove the tariffs now, right after the WTO ruling, if you want to make it look like your decision has nothing to do with possible EU retaliation?</p>
<p>No, it doesn’t make sense.  Instead, as I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003_11_09_angrybear_archive.html#106848282583194603">suggested earlier</a>,  I think Bush will use the WTO ruling as political cover that allows him to remove the tariffs while not admitting what the administration already knows – that the tariffs were a mistake.  In the process, he might actually help the US manufacturing sector – something that would admittedly be an untested policy first for this administration.   Even better, he gets to go to steel country in Ohio and Pennsylvania and blame the EU for the tariffs being lifted.  After all, from Bush&#8217;s perspective, what better scapegoat for this administration’s terrible economic policy-making than the EU?  Unless you can somehow blame Saddam Hussein.</p>

                                <p>Bush in the UK<br />

<p>There&#8217;s surely lots of interesting stuff for bloggers of all stripes in <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/11/16/bush_frost_int/index.html">Salon&#8217;s transcript</a> of Bush&#8217;s interview with the BBC&#8217;s David Frost. But the following juxtaposition struck me as peculiar:<br />
</p>
<p>On Iraq&#8217;s nonexistent biological weapons (<a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/11/16/bush_frost_int/index1.html">page 2</a>): </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And David Kay found evidence of weapons programs. He found some biological weapons &#8211; <strong>evidence of biological weapons</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>On North Korea&#8217;s nuclear weapons (<a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/11/16/bush_frost_int/index2.html">page 3</a>): </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And I would refer people to North Korea where we&#8217;ve got a multilateral attempt to convince Kim Jong Il to get rid of his <strong>nuclear ambitions</strong> &#8230; But what I&#8217;ve done is I&#8217;ve convinced China and South Korea, and Japan, and Russia to speak with one voice to the North Koreans and say, &#8216;Get rid of your <strong>nuclear ambitions</strong>.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Iraq has no WMD? Then they have WMD <a href="http://www.angrybear.blogspot.com/2003_06_29_angrybear_archive.html#105726793631448323">programs</a>, or we have evidence of WMD, or perhaps evidence of WMD programs, though of course no actual WMD. <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001786703_nkorea09.html">North Korea announces</a> that they have a nuclear deterrent ready to go, and the CIA believes the only thing stopping them from detonating a test bomb is the international backlash? That&#8217;s merely <strong>ambitions</strong>.</p>

                                <p>Clark 1, Russert 0<br />

<p>Appearing on Meet the Press with Tim Russert is basically mandatory for presidential candidates these days (though I think Bush will only do so again if he&#8217;s forced to do so by very close polls). Dean tried and didn&#8217;t do so well, though the attacks on his performance were <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh062703.shtml">largely unfair</a>. Clark, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t really seem to give much meat to his critics, and came across appearing much more knowledgeable on the issues than Russert (transcript <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/994273.asp">here</a>). Russert would throw out a quote and Clark responded ably. A quick check of the conservative National Review&#8217;s blog, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/corner.asp">The Corner</a>, and Instapundit support this take &#8212; neither has posts criticizing Clark&#8217;s appearance (though perhaps they are still waiting for the faxes from the RNC).</p>
<p>In any case, the following exchange was amusing and it illustrates the general give and take (and who was doing most of the taking) of the interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>MR. RUSSERT: After the war was commenced in April, you did write an article for The London Times and you said, “Can anything be more moving than the joyous throngs swarming the streets of Baghdad? Memories of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the defeat of Milosevic in Belgrade flood back. Statues and images of Saddam are smashed and defiled. &#8230; President Bush, Tony Blair should be proud of their resolve in the face of so much doubt.”</p>
<p>GEN. CLARK: But, Tim, do you have the rest of the article with you?</p>
<p>MR. RUSSERT: I’ve read&#8230;</p>
<p>GEN. CLARK: The rest of the article you should show because what it says is: “You can have your victory parade. You can have the soldiers parade up and down. You can be proud of the fact that you commanded these troops and they crushed this Army, but you must recognize that the job isn’t done. It may be only beginning. You haven’t found the weapons of mass destruction. And you’ve got a long way to go to put anything in place in the postwar.”</p>
<p>I’m writing as a commentator. I’m fair, and I respect the men and women in the armed forces. I love them, I’ve spent my life there, and I’m proud of them. And they did, in their military duties, a fabulous job in following the orders of the commander in chief. I simply wouldn’t have given those orders at that time. Those weren’t the right orders. Diplomacy hadn’t been exhausted, we hadn’t brought our allies on board, and we didn’t have an adequate plan for what would happen next. You cannot go to war in those circumstances and be successful. In Kosovo, we had exhausted diplomacy. We had our allies on board and we had a plan for what we would do when the fighting stopped. It was exactly the opposite situation.</p>

                                <p>The Era of Big Government<br />

<p>It&#8217;s been back since around early 2001, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/15/politics/15ENER.html?th">here&#8217;s some more</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Authors of the bill agreed to double the use of corn-based ethanol as a gasoline additive, a provision viewed as essential to building political support among farm state legislators. As part of that deal, producers of the additive MTBE, which has been blamed for groundwater pollution in many parts of the country, would gain immunity from product liability lawsuits and the substance would be banned nationwide as of 2015. The MTBE provision was a priority of Representative Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, and other lawmakers from Louisiana and Texas, where MTBE is produced.
<p>&#8230; Lobbyists and lawmakers said the key to passage might be the Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle, who has pushed the ethanol plan to benefit corn growers in his home state, South Dakota, and across the Midwest. </p>
<p>&#8230; Republican tax writers were still working out some final details Friday, and no price tag for the tax incentives was available. But the bill was expected to provide $18 billion or more in tax breaks to promote greater use of coal in power plants, to renew interest in nuclear power, to encourage oil companies to drill in deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico and to expand the generation of power through wind, among other things.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I can&#8217;t disagree <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/001833.html#001833">with Matt Y. &#8216;s assessment </a>of Daschle:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m going to have to do more reporting on this Monday, but my understanding is that Tom Daschle is prepared to sell the country out on a really awful bill for the sake of ethanol subsidies. </p></blockquote>

<p>Nice. In advance of his trip to London, the President found a <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/">publication</a> worthy of an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Press secretary Scott McClellan <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43228-2003Nov14.html">broke the news</a> yesterday with nonchalance. &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; he told reporters. &#8220;The president had his usual briefings this morning and just recently completed an interview with the Sun, for a discussion of his upcoming visit to the United Kingdom.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I went to the Sun&#8217;s website and tried to find the interview, but I couldn&#8217;t because I got distracted by the Sun&#8217;s topless <a href="http://www.page3.com/index2.shtml">Page 3 Girls</a> (no adult verification required),  <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/section/0,,5,00.html">this story</a> on &#8220;Heidi, Adriana and Tyra wing in as undie-clad angels,&#8221;  the &#8220;<a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/section/0,,2001310000,00.html">Be cheeky! Touch my bum&#8230; </a>&#8221; story that had something to do with some sort of video game but was actually about pictures of &#8220;Transylvanian twins Monica and Gabriella&#8221; in short-shorts. Then I re-resolved to find the Bush article, but got distracted by &#8220;<a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/section/0,,2002100003,00.html">Victoria Newton&#8217;s Bizarre Exposed</a>,&#8221; and then wandered over to &#8220;<a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001320001-2003530115,00.html">Dear Diedre</a>&#8221; to read about some poor young woman&#8217;s group-sex travails.</p>
<p>What could possibly possess Bush to grant an interview to this <strike>Newspaper</strike> tabloid and not the respectable but conservative <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/index.jhtml">Telegraph</a> or the slightly less conservative but even more respectable <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/">London Times</a>? <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/index2.html">Click here</a> to learn the answer (Hint: the same person owns Fox News and The Sun).</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://nitpicker.blogspot.com/2003_11_01_nitpicker_archive.html#106878986982436960">Via Nitpicker</a>,  I see that &#8220;[<a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,1082830,00.html">Bush lined</a>] up interviews with the BBC&#8217;s David Frost and the new Daily Telegraph editor Martin Newland.&#8221;</p>
