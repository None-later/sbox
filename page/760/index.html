                                <p><a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/11/why-are-hollywo.html?cid=89512920#comment-89512920">Alex Tabarrok</a> looks at the question:  &#8220;Why are unions so powerful in the entertainment industry when unions are generally weak and in decline in most other sectors of the economy?&#8221;</p>
<p>He asks his brother, a movie producer, and quotes him thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;unlike in most other unionized industries, it&#8217;s the INDIVIDUAL members of the unions in the entertainment industry that the management / owners want to work with. For example, Tom Cruise is a member of SAG, (I use him as an obvious example, but every other known actor is as well) and if the studios and producers want to make a film with Mr Cruise, and we all do, we have to come to terms with SAG. Similarly, Steven Spielberg is a member of the DGA, same issue. Though writers are not household names, it&#8217;s the same issue, there are specific individuals who the studios want to be writing their TV shows and screenplays.  It  doesn&#8217;t matter if Joe or John or Mary is stacking the boxes, flipping the burgers or ringing the cash registers so management can easily hire a non-union member to do the same job, in the film business we need to work with specific individuals who happen to be union members. Thus the power of those (comparatively) few empowers them all.</p></blockquote>
<p>To me, this answer is missing something.  Tom Cruise, presumably, knows that the studios want to work with him, and view most of the rest of the cast as interchangeable hired help.  So why should he be part of the union?  If he quits, the studios can hire him directly, and hire a bunch of non-union members as backup actors, grips, screen writers (given the implausibility of many Tom Cruise vehicles, do they even use screen writers on most of his movies these days?), etc.  That leaves a lot more money for the studios and Tom Cruise to split up, doesn&#8217;t it?  (Tabarrok feels that &#8220;big names don&#8217;t lose much from unions&#8221; &#8211; is this true if the lesser names are interchangeable?)</p>
<p>So why are unions so powerful in Hollywood, that even Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg remained members?</p>

<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/11/can-we-retire-b.html">Brad DeLong</a> calls for the retirement of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/opinion/10herbert.html?_r=2&#038;th=&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;oref=slogin&#038;emc=th&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;adxnnlx=1194741435-rB3hKb5eZbtPc0+J2S65nA">Bob Herbert</a> listing several problems with his latest op-ed.  The last on Brad’s list relates to this:</p>
<blockquote><p>In an interview after the hearing, Representative Hinchey discussed the disconnect between official government reports and the reality facing working families. He noted that the unemployment rate does not include workers who have become so discouraged that they’ve given up looking for a job. And the most popular measure of inflation, the Consumer Price Index, does not include the cost of energy or food, “the two most significant aspects of the increased cost of living for the American people.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Our graph shows both the overall CPI and the CPI less food and energy (LFE) from January 1997 to September 2007.  CPI-LFE has increased by about 2.2 percent per year over this period whereas the overall CPI has increased by 2.5 percent per year.  Interestingly, food prices have risen by 2.6 percent per year over this period.  The kicker is the rise in energy prices, which have risen by 5.6 percent per year over this period.  </p>
<p>Then that’s the point &#8211; as Brad notes &#8211; is that the overall CPI does include the cost of food and energy.  Congressman Maurice Hinchey is a Democrat representing District 22 of New York – which includes portion of eight counties from the Hudson River, through the Catskills, across the Southern Tier and up to the Finger Lakes. Its cities include Binghamton, Ithaca, Middletown, Kingston, Newburgh and Poughkeepsie.  Their Congressman appears to not under what is reported in the CPI.  Apparently, Bob Herbert is also this clueless.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/13550.html">Steve Benen</a> comes more stupidity from <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071109/NEWS09/711090369/-1/politics&#038;lead=1">RUDY</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republican Rudy Giuliani, campaigning in Iowa the same day that Bill Clinton was in the Hawkeye State, charged Thursday that the former president had weakened the American military and intelligence services through spending cuts during his administration. &#8220;Our military is too small to deal with the Islamic terrorism threats, but it really is too small to deter would-be aggressors to even think of challenging us. And that&#8217;s due to Bill Clinton,&#8221; Giuliani told students and others in the audience of about 350 at Iowa State University&#8217;s Memorial Union. &#8220;Bill Clinton cut our military and our intelligence budget by such a huge amount that we&#8217;ve never made up the difference,&#8221; said the former New York mayor, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.  Giuliani said in response to a question about relations with China that the United States needs a bigger military, including at least 10 more combat brigades and a 300-ship Navy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steve asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Does this make any sense? What threats are we incapable of dealing with? And if they exist, why hasn’t Bush/Cheney done anything about it? We already spend more on the military than most of the world put together &#8211; who else does Giuliani want to invade? (Oh wait, don’t answer that.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s obvious to everyone with an IQ above the teens that the horrible decision on March 19, 2003 is what is stretching our military beyond its limits. I guess Ron Paul is the only GOP candidate with a brain.  But let’s go past foreign and military policy – something RUDY is totally clueless about – and turn to fiscal policy.</p>
<p>RUDY has already said reducing tax rates will lower the deficit.  Now he says we should spend more – A LOT MORE – on defense spending.  Does the arithmetic challenged egomaniac thinks DoD spending pays for itself too?  Your modern Republican Party – advocating massive defense spending paying for it with tax “cuts”.  Pathetic.</p>

<blockquote><p>President Bush and the current administration have borrowed more money from foreign governments and banks than the previous 42 presidents combined, a group of conservative to moderate Democrats said Friday.</p>
<p>Blue Dog Coalition, which describes itself as a group &#8220;focused on fiscal responsibility,&#8221; called the administration&#8217;s borrowing practices &#8220;astounding.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Treasury Department, from 1776-2000, the first 224 years of U.S. history, 42 U.S. presidents borrowed a combined $1.01 trillion from foreign governments and financial institutions, but in the past four years alone, the Bush administration borrowed $1.05 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cactus interjecting&#8230;  It sounds ludicrous, even taking into account the fact that the figures are nominal rather than real.  So I did a bit of checking&#8230;  from <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/tic/mfh.txt">the Treasury site</a>, we learn that in August 2007, total foreign borrowing equaled 2.2 trillion give or take a few pennies.</p>
<p>We can get the same figure for December of 2000, the last full month before our Bush took office, <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/tic/mfhhis01.txt">at another location on the Treasury&#8217;s site</a>:  1.015 trillion.</p>
<p>So yeah, the nominal debt more than doubled.  What about real debt?  Well, the BLS has a nifty <a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl">inflation calculator</a> and it tells me that 1.015 trillion in 2000 was equal to 1.23 trillion in 2007.  Inflation adjusted, the statement in the article is not quite right.  But its not that far off either, and the Bush still has another year in office.  So far, our Bush has spent up a storm.  (To which one can only say:  &#8220;Damn Bill Clinton.  Damn Nancy Pelosi.  Damn George Soros.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Back to T-bone&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Does this mean anything in particular in regards to the value of the dollar?</p>
<p>As I understand it, borrowing from Americans means US dollars are borrowed and spent by the government rather than being invested (most likely) or spent (least likely) by the individuals. So I don&#8217;t think that affects the dollar&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>But does borrowing foreign affect the dollar&#8217;s value? Could this be part of why the dollar has dropped so dramatically during this administration?</p></blockquote>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

                                <p>Reader Formerly Anonymous tells us the Surge is working.  As evidence, he points to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/07/iraq/main3463847.shtml">this article</a> and provides this excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>The number of Iraqis returning to their country after fleeing abroad is growing, with more than 46,000 people coming home last month, an Iraqi government spokesman said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Brig. Gen. Qassim al-Moussawi, the Iraqi spokesman for a U.S.-Iraqi military push to pacify Baghdad, said border crossings recorded 46,030 people returning to Iraq in October alone. He attributed the large number to the &#8220;improving security situation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He ignores the caption on the photo in the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Iraqi refugees living in Syria head back to their country at the al-Tanaf border crossing between Syria and Iraq, in Syria, in this Sept. 20, 2007 file photo. A growing wave of Iraqis are returning home from Syria, not because they are confident of their nation&#8217;s future, but because they have run out of money.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this from the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the rise also came as Iraq&#8217;s neighbors, particularly Syria and Jordan, have tightened their borders to Iraqis fleeing the turmoil in their own country. Syria is home to at least 1.2 million Iraqi refugees, and Jordan has about 750,000.</p>
<p>Many of those Iraqis are living in limbo, unable to work and running out of whatever money they were able to bring out of Iraq.</p>
<p>Both countries are struggling to provide services to incoming Iraqis, and began requiring visas for them starting this past summer. Most applications are denied.</p>
<p>Those who fled to Syria or Jordan before the new rules took effect must leave when their three-month permits expire, unless they have been officially recognized by the United Nations as refugees &#8211; a process that can take months.</p>
<p>That leaves many people with the choice of returning to Iraq or risking deportation anyway. And with the improving security situation, it appears many Iraqis are opting to return home. </p></blockquote>
<p>I imagine that in 1939, someone like Formerly Anonymous would have pointed to the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_St._Louis">most of the passengers of the St. Louis returned to Europe</a> as a sure sign that anti-Semitism was on the decline in Germany.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s more:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, some 2 million Iraqis have fled their country. Besides Syria and Jordan, Egypt has absorbed 100,000. Some 54,000 Iraqis are in Iran, 40,000 in Lebanon, 10,000 in Turkey and 200,000 in various Persian Gulf countries.</p>
<p>The U.S. admitted only 1,608 Iraqi refugees this past fiscal year. Sweden has admitted more than 18,000 since 2006, the highest number in any European country, but now says it too is tightening asylum rules.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Iraqi Red Crescent issued a report saying nearly 2.3 million Iraqis &#8211; the vast majority of them women and children &#8211; have fled their homes but remain inside the country&#8217;s borders.</p>
<p>The number of internally displaced people, or IDPs, in Iraq grew by 16 percent in September &#8211; to 2,299,425, the Red Crescent said. That figure has skyrocketed since the beginning of 2007, when less than half a million people were listed as displaced. </p></blockquote>
<p>And then there&#8217;s this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Al-Moussawi questioned those figures in a news conference on Wednesday, publicly asking the Red Crescent to &#8220;give reasons behind this high number.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The increase announced by the Red Crescent is not logical, because now we are living a stable security situation and many families have returned to their original places,&#8221; al-Moussawi said.</p></blockquote>
<p>If only the Red Crescent would talk about the school houses being painted&#8230;</p>

<p>So a question to those who consider the Surge a success&#8230;  if there&#8217;s still shooting going on at this time next year, will you still consider the Surge a success?  Given that failure to meet its stated objectives is apparently not an issue, are there any possible conditions under which one could look back next year and conclude that perhaps, just perhaps, the Surge wasn&#8217;t successful?</p>

<blockquote><p>In fact, however, a considerable amount of the money the U.S. gives to Pakistan is administered not through U.S. agencies or joint U.S.-Pakistani programs. Instead, the U.S. gives Musharraf&#8217;s government about $200 million annually and his military $100 million monthly in the form of direct cash transfers. Once that money leaves the U.S. Treasury, Musharraf can do with it whatever he wants. He needs only promise in a secret annual meeting that he&#8217;ll use it to invest in the Pakistani people. And whatever happens as the result of Rice&#8217;s review, few Pakistan watchers expect the cash transfers to end.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hand someone $100 million a month, in cash, with no strings attached.  Gee, sounds like a bribe to me.</p>
<p>Apropos of nothing, on the Department of Justice site I found a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/dojdocb.html">lay-person&#8217;s guide to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In general, the FCPA prohibits corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230; </p>
<blockquote><p>As a result of SEC investigations in the mid-1970&#8217;s, over 400 U.S. companies admitted making questionable or illegal payments in excess of $300 million to foreign government officials, politicians, and political parties. The abuses ran the gamut from bribery of high foreign officials to secure some type of favorable action by a foreign government to so-called facilitating payments that allegedly were made to ensure that government functionaries discharged certain ministerial or clerical duties. Congress enacted the FCPA to bring a halt to the bribery of foreign officials and to restore public confidence in the integrity of the American business system.</p>
<p>The FCPA was intended to have and has had an enormous impact on the way American firms do business. Several firms that paid bribes to foreign officials have been the subject of criminal and civil enforcement actions, resulting in large fines and suspension and debarment from federal procurement contracting, and their employees and officers have gone to jail. To avoid such consequences, many firms have implemented detailed compliance programs intended to prevent and to detect any improper payments by employees and agents.</p>
<p>Following the passage of the FCPA, the Congress became concerned that American companies were operating at a disadvantage compared to foreign companies who routinely paid bribes and, in some countries, were permitted to deduct the cost of such bribes as business expenses on their taxes. Accordingly, in 1988, the Congress directed the Executive Branch to commence negotiations in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to obtain the agreement of the United States&#8217; major trading partners to enact legislation similar to the FCPA. In 1997, almost ten years later, the United States and thirty-three other countries signed the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. The United States ratified this Convention and enacted implementing legislation in 1998. See Convention and Commentaries on the DOJ web site.</p>
<p>The antibribery provisions of the FCPA make it unlawful for a U.S. person, and certain foreign issuers of securities, to make a corrupt payment to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person. Since 1998, they also apply to foreign firms and persons who take any act in furtherance of such a corrupt payment while in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>I realize the FCPA doesn&#8217;t apply here&#8230;  the gubmint is doing the bribing, after all.  But still, it makes for an interesting contrast.  And I can only imagine how this will play out should a company with which GW or the Dark Lord or Condi or any of the other wonderful cast of characters in today&#8217;s White House is associated want to do business with Pakistan in the future.  Or should a company associated with their family members want to do business with Pakistan today.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Iraqi interior minister said Wednesday that he would authorize raids by his security forces on Western security firms to ensure that they were complying with tightened licensing requirements on guns and other weaponry, setting up the possibility of violent confrontations between the Iraqis and heavily armed Western guards.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Every company will be subject to such examination, and any company that does not follow the law will lose its license,” the minister, Jawad al-Bolani, said of the planned raids. “They are called security companies. They are not called violate-the-law companies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, right.  Wait until they try to raid Blackwater.</p>
<blockquote><p> Within Baghdad’s relatively safe and heavily guarded Green Zone, there have been early indications of a battle over who controls Iraqi streets. Private security guards say that Iraqi police officers have already descended on Western compounds and stopped vehicles driven by Westerners to check for weapons violations in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Any extension of those measures into the rest of the country, known as the Red Zone, could quickly turn into armed confrontation. Westerners are wary of Interior Ministry checkpoints, some of which have been fake, as well as of ministry units, which are sometimes militia-controlled and have been implicated in sectarian killings. Western convoys routinely have to choose between the risk of stopping and the risk of accelerating past what appear to be official Iraqi forces.</p>
<p>And because Western convoys run by private security companies are often protecting senior American civilian and military officials, the Iraqi government’s struggle with the companies has in some cases become a sort of proxy tug-of-war with the United States.</p>
<p>That dynamic was laid bare in the weeks immediately after the shooting on Sept. 16 in Nisour Square in Baghdad. The Iraqi government at first suggested that it would ban Blackwater, which has a contract to protect American diplomats, from working in Iraq. But the government was embarrassed when it discovered that its legal options were limited, and the United States — after placing a few new restrictions on the company — quickly sent it back onto the streets.</p>
<p>Based on its own investigation, the Iraqi government has concluded that the Blackwater guards who opened fire committed murder. An American investigation led by the F.B.I. has not yet publicly announced any results.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;But the government was embarrassed when it discovered that its legal options were limited&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Imagine this&#8230; some gang members open fire on random civilians in downtown LA.  The LA cops, LA&#8217;s mayor, California&#8217;s governor, and the government of the US want something done.  But the government of another country puts the kibosh on taking any action.  The gang members cannot be arrested or prosecuted &#8211; they can&#8217;t even be kicked out of the country or removed from the city.  Can a situation like that be described with the word &#8220;sovereignty.&#8221;</p>

The dollar has been falling steadily for several months, and some 5% in the last month, against major currencies.  But one of the most popular “contrarian” signals is that a cover story on the Dollar reaches the front page of the Economist , according to many.  A second, slightly more frivolous signal, was that Gisele, the world’s top fashion model from Brazil , refuses to take Dollars for her jobs any more.  Plus Jim Rogers, commodities lover and dollar pessimist, has been invited to talk on Bloomberg TV twice recently.</p></blockquote>
<p>OldVet provides <a rhef="http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10109226">this link</a> to a story in the Economist.  </p>
<p>He goes on to note contrarian signals have to be taken with a grain of salt.  So&#8230; has the dollar fallen too far too fast?  Is it going to rise a bit at this point?</p>
<p>BTW&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t consider Gisele&#8217;s move to be contrarian.  I listened to Brazilian newscasts a lot growing up, and I&#8217;ve recently started listening to Brazilian news on the radio while making my breakfast in the morning.  (Since I rarely eat dinner, breakfast is the one meal of the day that takes a bit of time to prepare, especially now that we&#8217;re in pomegranate season!!!)  Anyway, as far back as I can remember, Brazilian newscasts have always, repeat, always mentioned the value of the dollar.  Nowadays, they also mention the value of the Euro.  I&#8217;m not saying Gisele is right, but Brazilians who pay attention to the news are far more aware of currency values than most Americans.</p>

<blockquote><p>SSSSHHHHHHH &#8230; Don&#8217;t Tell Anyone: Al Qaeda Has Been Routed in Baghdad</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Newspaper of Record has the story today &#8230; on page A-19.</p>
<p>&#8230; And even there, the Times can&#8217;t bring itself to say we won.  The report is headlined, &#8220;Militant Group Is Out of Baghdad, U.S. Says.&#8221;  They left — not we kicked their ass out.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s much whining about the NY Times perfidy here&#8230; but here&#8217;s my take on this little post by Andy McCarthy.  See, I have little doubt that Al Qaeda has been routed in Baghdad.  Which means that either the violence has ended in Baghdad, or there are a lot of  folks engaging in violence that are not Al Qaeda.  Since the violence has not ended in Baghdad&#8230; clearly there are a lot of non-AQ people engaging in violence.  (This should surprise nobody.)</p>
<p>So now we&#8217;re at a classic case of mission drift.  The original goal was to eliminate Saddam and get rid of WMDs.  Mission accomplished.  Then there was talk of promoting democracy.  Judging by the purple fingers of Republican voters back in 2004, that also occurred.  Getting rid of Al Qaeda was another.  That&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>So when the heck can we pull out?  What else is there?</p>
