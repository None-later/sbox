                                <p>After several lines of sheer babbling <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTM3YmE3NjYzMzk3ZDZiZWUxZDgyZWE5NDE0NjI1MTg=">Jonah</a> treats us with this really funny line:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even former House Speaker Newt Gingrich — who actually knows how markets work and is better at explaining them than any other politician today</p></blockquote>
<p>No, I think Jonah really believes that Gingrich is a serious economic scholar, which likely explains this babbling:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. government has barred billions of barrels of oil from coming to the market by declaring huge petroleum reserves off-limits to drilling. Uncle Sam stores vast amounts in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in a petro-lockbox for a rainy day now called “election season.” Government — at the federal and state levels — drives up pump prices with gas taxes and regulations against increasing refinery capacity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Never mind that the EIA has already analyzed the effect on oil prices from allowing more offshore drilling and that it will have no current effect and a very small effect in the future.  The idea that the existence of taxes causes prices to rise is sheer insanity especially given the fact that the relative price of these taxes has eroded over time.  <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gaspump.html">This source</a> shows that the share of taxes in the price of gasoline has fallen to only 10.6% as of May 2008.  Also note that the share of the price gasoline that goes to the refinery margin was only 10% so Jonah&#8217;s line about regulations against increasing refinery capacity is not exactly on-point as far as the current price of gasoline.  No &#8211; it is the price of oil not what the refineries are getting that is driving today&#8217;s prices.  </p>
<p>Maybe we should turn the microphone over to a real economist &#8211; <a href="http://content.ksg.harvard.edu/blog/jeff_frankels_weblog/2008/07/15/offshoring-is-a-more-dubious-policy-when-the-question-is-oil-drilling">Jeff Frankel</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once the long-term goal of “energy security” policy is properly seen to be amelioration of the economic effects of such a disaster, the Republican policy of “drain America first” is seen to be precisely the wrong response.  We don’t want to maximize current domestic production.  Rather we want to leave the oil underground (or underwater) for decades, until we really need it, until we are so desperate that the economic benefits really do outweigh the costs.  (The costs are chiefly environmental, of course.  But the Republicans have often been keen on giving oil companies access to nationally owned reserves at prices that are even below market costs.   Same as hard-rock mining for mining companies, subsidized water for farmers, and grazing rights on federal lands for ranchers.  But the hypocrisy of the self-reliance rhetoric in Western states — “get Washington off our backs” –  is another story.)  Thus the Democrats have it precisely backwards.   The problem with Republican proposals to re-open domestic oil drilling is not that we desperately need the oil right now, whereas new oil discoveries would not come on line for 5 years or more.   Rather it is that we might truly desperately need the oil in 20 or 30 years, and so don’t want to use it up over the next decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update: At Movie Guy’s insistent request, let me cite <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/crude-tumbles-further-surprise-inventories/story.aspx?guid=%7BABE270BA-1E5C-4300-A641-FCD451DFEFF3%7D&#038;dist=msr_1">this story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) &#8212; Crude-oil futures fell over $4 a barrel Wednesday, leaving crude with its biggest two-day drop in 17 years, after government data showed a surprise increase in U.S. petroleum inventories. U.S. crude inventories rose 3 million barrels to stand at 296.9 million barrels in the week ended July 11, the Energy Information Administration reported. Analysts surveyed by energy-information provider Platts were expecting a drop of 3 million barrels. &#8220;If there is anything that should keep the bulls in the corral while the bears feed in the berry patch, this EIA report is it,&#8221; said James Williams, an economist at energy research firm WTRG Economics &#8230; The unexpected gains in last week&#8217;s U.S. inventories &#8220;could indicate that the idea of real global demand destruction is finally beginning to take hold in the marketplace,&#8221; said Robert Arber, an analyst at financial information provider Stockhouse.com. EIA&#8217;s latest report showed fuel demand is falling. Over the last four weeks, U.S. motor gasoline demand has averaged 9.3 million barrels per day, down by 2.1% from the same period last year, the EIA said.</p></blockquote>
<p>For some reason, MovieGuy felt justified to write the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>If it is the case (and I don&#8217;t know how you would know any facts on this point) that announcements of future intentions will have no bearing on crude oil futures, why did the futures drop after the President&#8217;s announcement and Ben Bernanke&#8217;s testimony this week? You can&#8217;t have it both ways. Either bite the bullet on your position or perhaps back off if you think that you&#8217;re on questionable ground.</p></blockquote>
<p>So let’s see: (a) I don’t know “any facts” on this issue; (b) the only reason for the fall in future prices is Bush’s call for offshore drilling; and (c) anything I or EIA has said to the contrary is simply wrong.  This according to MovieGuy.  Funny – the MarketWatch explanation did not support this contention at all!</p>

<blockquote><p>The McCain campaign is taking their effort to distance their candidate from the unpopular President Bush to a whole new level: McCain&#8217;s advisers are now openly attacking Bush on Iraq &#8212; and not only that, they&#8217;re also saying that Barack Obama is the one who is like Bush on the war!  On a conference call just now with reporters, McCain foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann compared Barack Obama&#8217;s insistence on a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq to Bush&#8217;s insistence that we were winning even as things went badly for years.  &#8220;I think the American people have had enough of inflexibility and stubbornness in national security policy,&#8221; Scheunemann said. When asked later by the Huffington Post&#8217;s Sam Stein whether the campaign was disparaging President Bush, Scheunemann dug in: &#8220;We cannot afford to replace one administration that refused for too long to acknowledge failure in Iraq with a candidate that refuses to acknowledge success in Iraq.&#8221;  Forget &#8220;McSame.&#8221; The candidate who would really continue Bush&#8217;s policies is &#8220;BushBama.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are not familiar with Randy Scheunemann, <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/204324.php">David Kurtz</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>This takes some real cojones. A short time ago on a conference call with reporters, Randy Scheunemann, McCain&#8217;s top foreign policy adviser, declared that Obama brings the same failed approach to Iraq as President Bush … Scheunemann was, of course, a significant proponent of the Iraq invasion and as Josh noted the other day worked closely with Ahmad Chalabi and the other usual suspects in pushing the U.S. toward war with Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>Has John McCain surrounded himself with advisors that make President Bush’s crew look smart by comparison – or what?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/07/15/a-majority-consider-afghanistan-a-failure.aspx">Michelle Cottle</a> is royally brassed off but manages to capture my frustrations with these neocon nitwits perfectly:</p>
<blockquote><p>But here&#8217;s the figure that really caught my eye and the one which the Bush administration should find most shameful&#8211;if indeed it had the capacity for shame. At this point, only 51% of Americans believe the war in Afghanistan to have been worth fighting. This despite the fact that that wretched, utterly dysfunctional country was home base for the Taliban, al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. The bulk of the 9-11 butchers may have originally hailed from Saudi Arabia, but they took their orders and inspiration from the utterly reprehensible fundamentalist nutters running amok in Afghanistan. Alas, the Bush adminstration has done such a sad, scatter-shot job with its War on Terror that most people don&#8217;t know what to think about our little Afghan adventure now. Fifty-one percent of Americans also say the military action there has been unsuccessful&#8211;a view surely fed by the fact that the Taliban has regrouped in the tribal areas of Pakistan and is conducting a nasty guerilla war against the current Afghan government. By allowing itself to become distracted from Afghanistan&#8211;not to mention babbling on dishonestly and confusingly about the nonexistent connections between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda&#8211;the Bushies have managed to convince much of America that we never should have bothered in the first place. This is outrageous. Afghanistan should have sent a loud, definitive signal to hostile regimes worldwide about the power and commitment of American power. Instead, barely half of this country thinks we&#8217;ve done a decent enough job to justify the entire endeavor.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Even before Barack Obama says a word upon his arrival in Israel next week, close observers of America&#8217;s role in the region will get a message from the presence in his delegation of a tall, slightly disheveled diplomat well known to the power players of the Middle East. In a region where simple words and gestures can be taken as weighty indicators of intent, Arabs and Israelis alike will see much meaning in the return of Dennis Ross.  In one way, the message is simple: Ross, a career foreign service officer, was lead negotiator on Israeli-Palestinian issues for Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and he got the two sides as close as they&#8217;ve come to a peace deal before stepping down after the 2000 election. His presence alongside Obama in Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan is designed to signal the senator&#8217;s intent to resume the active pursuit of the peace process, which Obama claims President George W. Bush has derailed through inaction.</p></blockquote>
<p>This story links to a profile of <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1637309,00.html">Dennis Ross</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Few people in the world are as practiced in the diplomatic arts as Dennis Ross. After all, he served as a distinguished Middle East envoy for Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. But in his new book, Statecraft: and How to Restore America&#8217;s Standing in the World, Ross pulls no punches when assessing the actions of the current Administration: &#8220;After nearly four years of warfare, Iraq has been a disaster, costing thousands of lives, requiring the expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars, stretching our forces and reserve system to the breaking point, and becoming a magnet for terrorists and hostility toward the United States throughout the Muslim world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Senator Hagel – a grownup member of the Republican Party – will join Senator Obama during the trip to Iraq.  In my view, the more GOP grownups that President Obama asks to assist in the setting and implementation of his foreign policy, the better.</p>

<blockquote><p>A leading drug company may be poised to win a landmark legal victory next fall. If the drug manufacturer, Wyeth, prevails in a case soon to be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court (Wyeth v. Levine),1 drug companies could effectively be immunized against state-level tort litigation if their products that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are later found to be defective. <br />A medical-device company won such a victory in April. In Riegel v. Medtronic,2 the Supreme Court determined that a product-liability lawsuit against Medtronic in a state court was preempted because the device had received FDA approval. Preemption is a legal doctrine based on the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which states that when federal and state laws are at odds, federal law takes precedence. Its application to state tort litigation is a radical extension of its original meaning. </p>
<p>Medtronic won its case because the 1976 law that grants the FDA authority to regulate medical devices contains a clause asserting that state requirements with regard to medical devices are preempted by federal requirements. Although the preemption clause is silent on common-law tort actions, the Supreme Court (with Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the Court) interpreted the preemption clause broadly to include such actions. </p>
<p>Unlike the law governing medical devices, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which provides the statutory framework for the regulation of drugs by the FDA, contains no such preemption clause. Thus, in Wyeth v. Levine — which concerns a patient who lost her arm after an injection of Wyeth&#8217;s antiemetic drug Phenergan — the Court will decide whether preemption of state tort litigation is implied by the law, even though it is not explicitly stated. </p>
<p>Previous administrations and the FDA considered tort litigation to be an important part of an overall regulatory framework for drugs and devices; product-liability litigation by consumers was believed to complement the FDA&#8217;s regulatory actions and enhance patient safety. Margaret Jane Porter, former chief counsel of the FDA, wrote, &#8220;FDA product approval and state tort liability usually operate independently, each providing a significant, yet distinct, layer of consumer protection.&#8221;3 Persons who are harmed have the right to seek legal redress. Preemption would erase that right.</p></blockquote>
<p>Real conservatives note that the courts are an avenue for personal redress for injury.  what is it called when a company has immunity provided by a government agency-something ism, I believe.  </p>
<p>Current Republicans also complain of tort law and insurance, but have not made any case at all using court statistics to prove the point of awards versus malpractice insurance rates.</p>
<p>Usually just insurance rates are quoted, which is real.  But I have yet to see reasonably open books by insurance companies to make the case, and a list of judgements on which they based their predictions of higher payouts/rate ratios.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be simpler if insurance companies supply the data, since I assume they have had to access such data?</p>
<p>If they did not <a href="http://www.mcandl.com/ohio.html">demand policy and regulation changes</a>, perhaps they might have an easier time of it. If you demand regulatory action and favors, is it reasonable to open the books some for a check on the claims?</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Senator McCain was in Colombia last week touting his support for the trade agreement that the Bush administration had negotiated with the country. He also touted his support for NAFTA, contrasting both positions with Senator Obama&#8217;s opposition to the two pacts. McCain had an important ally in his campaign. The media decided to embellish McCain&#8217;s case by touting his support for &#8216;free trade,&#8217; as opposed to the specific deals in question. This is a very important difference and it reflects deeply held biases in the media.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/democrats-republicans-and-lags.html">Cactus states from last year that:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Some readers have said that one cannot read much into the results of all these series, that they do not, in fact, show that Democrats do a better job at these measures than Republicans. These readers tend to want to vote Republican, and they insist that most of a President’s policies have long lag times, so their effects may not even show while a President is in office.</p>
<p>And to some extent, they’re right. For instance, to use a little publicized piece of policy… when GW (temporarily) retired the 30 year bond in 2001, he in effect prevented the country from locking in the very, very low rates that prevailed until the 30 year bond was reinstated. This will result in higher interest payments, probably for decades to come. Similarly, abstinence only programs – children not having the benefit of sex ed are likely to have unexpected and unwanted pregnancies with allthe problems that entails, including abortions, as much as 30 years later.</p>
<p>But most of a President’s policies have a much more immediate effect. And most people who insist on the long lag explanation believe that too – most of them are quick to credit the performance of the economy in the last few years (though, I would imagine, not in the last quarter) to the President’s tax cuts in 2003. And they are quick to credit Reagan for turning the country around – early in the Reagan administration, not during the GHW administration. (Though if one reads the National Review or Clown Hall, one can sometimes find examples where they credit Reagan for everything good that happened in the Clinton years.) </p>
<p>Furthermore, I’ve had posts looking at the correlation between deficit spending and growth, and between taxes and growth. The correlations are there, and they kick in very quickly.</p>
<p>But in the end, the big problem with the lag theory is that the <em>length of the lag magically changes</em>. If Republicans are responsible for the growth during Democratic admnistrations, and vice versa, how do we account for the poor performance of GHW in almost every measure? Did Reagan’s virtues only begin to kick in 4 years after he left office? And why didn’t that happen with Ike, or Nixon/Ford, both of whom were followed by Presidents that outperformed them on most measures? </p>
<p>Similarly, if Reagan had to struggle to build things up after Carter… why did GHW have the same struggle? And if it took Carter only four years to screw things up, why wasn’t that true of the other Democratic administrations? Why didn’t things hit the proverbial fan from 1965 to 1968, or from 1996 to 2000? </p>
<p>And then there is one other problem. To which President would the lag proponents credit the performance during the Reagan administration? Carter? Nixon &#038; Ford? Or does it go back farther, to LBJ? I think none of the above. They will tell you that Reagan was the one that made things the way they were in the Reagan administration, at least the good thing. (I’ve seen the Reagan deficits blamed on Congress many a time.) </p>
<p>I don’t buy the lag story at all. If the data shows that things generally went better in Democratic administrations, its either because God doesn’t like it when we vote Republican, or because Democratic Presidents have followed better policies. Take your pick.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>And that lumping together Shia extremists with Sunni extremists, assuming that Persian culture is the same as Arab culture, that those kinds of errors in lumping Islam together result in us not only being less effective in hunting down and isolating terrorists, but also in alienating what need to be our long-term allies on a whole host of issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ezra notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>As Obama says, one of the clear distinctions between the Left&#8217;s approach to terrorism and the Right&#8217;s approach to terrorism is that the Left wants to limit the scope of the conflict, while the Right wants to expand it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bingo – but the money quote has to be:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rather than this being an effort to hunt down al Qaeda, it becomes a war to hunt down al Qaeda, destroy Hezbollah, eradicate Hamas, overthrow Saddam Hussein, change the regime in Tehran, crush the Muslim Brotherhood, and confront Syria, and whatever else Bill Kristol thought of while eating his Cheerios that week.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another major energy proposal in the McCain economic plan is ending subsidies for corn ethanol and eliminating the tariff that effectively bars to importation of sugar cane ethanol. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13view.html?ex=1373601600&#038;en=d29d44dcc70127bf&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink"> Greg Mankiw scored these on behalf of the economics profession</a> as points for McCain over Obama in the NYT over the weekend.  I agree that corn ethanol subsidies are best eliminated as soon as possible — though I note that Obama, while not going so far as McCain on subsidies, is pretty straight-talking about the limitations of corn ethanol especially considering that he represents the corn belt and not the desert.</p>
<p>On the McCain plans for promoting trade in cane ethanol — the Shorter Version of which is that he&#8217;s proposing to substitute dependence on foreign ethanol for dependence on foreign oil (*) — there are significant issues that go to the suitability of &#8220;free&#8221; markets for provision of biofuels.  Whether or not expanding trade in ethanol is a good thing depends on other institutional arrangements that are not automatic consequences of reducing tariffs and other moves to freer trade.  Since critical policy decisions are outside the reach of U.S. policymakers, economists should be concerned about making policy with the institutions we have, and not the institutions we&#8217;d like to assume we have.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a broad dawning that not all biofuels, and not all methods for producing all biofuels, equally satisfy all of the policy goals that they might purport to help satisfy.  Those include substituting domestic resources for imported resources, reducing fossil fuel use, and reducing the carbon intensity of liquid fuel use.  Land use issues are critical both for the global warming-related goals for biofuel use and for avoiding blowback from high food prices.  (Recent <a href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/15382">research out of UW-Madison</a> shows that redirecting marginal agricultural lands to cane ethanol in fact can be beneficial, but conversions from forests and other uses are not.)  The problem is that lowering tariffs on cane ethanol doesn&#8217;t guarantee, and indeed in the absence of other interventions would probably work strongly against, desirable land use patterns.</p>
<p>Brazil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fuel_in_Brazil#Economic_and_production_indicators">produces a lot of ethanol</a> by the standards of the ethanol industry, but not a lot relative to U.S. petroleum-based fuel imports.  The former was 327,000 barrels/day in &#8217;07, whereas the latter is 13-14 million b/d (unadjusted for the energy densities of the fuels).   Growing enough cane to replace U.S. oil imports with ethanol would require on the order of half the arable land area of Brazil; major cane ethanol substitution would necessarily occur at scales where adverse land-use consequences can&#8217;t be assumed away.  Note that the current food-price spike, largely blamed on biofuel mandates, happened with only a couple percent of arable land devoted to biofuel crops.</p>
<p>Economists certainly can imagine market-based remedies for the problem, such as Pigovian taxes on certain land-use changes, to name one that Mankiw ought to support in principle.  But removing U.S. tariffs won&#8217;t make land-use regulation in countries suitable to cane growing appear by magic.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to add in liquid-fuel demand destruction on hitherto unprecedented scales for the U.S.  Along those lines, apart from his willingness to commit 15% of one year&#8217;s &#8220;clean coal&#8221; research funds to the cause of battery technology, McCain isn&#8217;t explicitly committed to more than the pending tightening of fuel economy regulations.  McCain&#8217;s long-standing hostility to rail and apparent indifference towards non-automobile transportation modes doesn&#8217;t make the job of reducing petroleum-based fuel consumption (and doing it in less painful ways to consumers than letting the price mechanism work its magic) any easier.</p>
<p>(*) Economists wouldn&#8217;t tend to be bothered by this, but it&#8217;s at odds with McCain&#8217;s energy independence rhetoric.</p>

                                <p>Here&#8217;s an oddity from the McCain economic plan — McCain found some jobs that have gone away and that does want to bring back:<br />
<blockquote>The development of clean coal technology will revitalize coal mining and return jobs to some of America&#8217;s most economically disadvantaged areas.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/ptb0702.html">U.S. coal production</a> was 1.146 billion (short) tons in 2007, just short of the record 1.163 billion tons in 2006.  There are three major features of coal production history: a long secular increase from the early sixties, a shift from underground to surface (a/k/a strip) mining as the dominant production mode, and great increases in productivity in both modes from the 1980s onward.  In 1987, an <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/ptb0706.html">hour of mining labor</a> extracted 2.2 tons of coal in an underground mine, and 4.98 tons in a surface mine.  By 2007, those figures had increased to 3.26 and 10.23 tons/hour, respectively.</p>
<p>So why is John McCain against labor productivity?</p>
<p>And why am I reminded of Dana Carvey&#8217;s <a href="http://www.danacarvey.net/media/snl_grumpy_losealimb.wav">Grumpy Old Man</a> character?  &#8220;In my day, we mined coal with our fingernails, got black lung, and that&#8217;s the way it was, and we LIKED IT!!&#8221;</p>
