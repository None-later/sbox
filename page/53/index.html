                                <p>The US Senate election in MA is between Senator Scott Brown and challenger Elizabeth Warren.  While there has been some discussion on financial concerns, there hasn&#8217;t been a lot to report of substance during the election campaign for us to post.  One of the tweets making the rounds is what it would be like to be sitting on the <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/">Senate Banking etc. Committee</a>, members who blocked Warren&#8217;s consideration as the director of the newly created  <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/Pages/cfpb.aspx">Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB)</a> if Warren takes her seat at the table.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/11/the-false-dodd-frank-narrative-occupy-wall-street-attacks-huge-hot-money-loophole-in-the-law.html">Matt Stoller</a> writes at <i>Naked Capitalism</i> on whether financial regulation has teeth and addresses real problems.</p>
<blockquote><p>Proponents of Dodd-Frank have an incentive to argue the law is a tough crack-down on Wall Street. It’s a core part of Barack Obama’s narrative, that he bailed out the banks, but then did what FDR did in the 1930s with a series of tight regulations. Of course, it was immediately obvious that Dodd-Frank was an afterthought of the Bush/Obama administrations, that the real policy framework involved three key fights – the Fannie/Freddie bailouts under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (the so-called bazooka law), TARP, and the reappointment of Ben Bernanke. These fights were supplemented by Eric Holder’s <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/09/marcy-wheeler-lanny-breuer-admits-that-economists-have-convinced-him-not-to-indict-corporations.html">decision to give legal forbearance</a> to Wall Street executives, to not prosecute for rigging the CDO market or any number of illegalities in the foreclosure space.</p>

<p>After this radical consolidation of banking <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/11/the-false-dodd-frank-narrative-occupy-wall-street-attacks-huge-hot-money-loophole-in-the-law.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#">power<img src="http://images.intellitxt.com/ast/adTypes/icon1.png"></a> in the hands of bailed out Too Big To Fail institutions, the Obama administration went to work on Dodd-Frank, which was essentially a <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/07/matt-stoller-dodd-frank-made-no-structural-changes-to-banking-system.html">2000 page mash note</a> to regulators saying “please don’t let that crisis happen again, it was awkward’. And now the evidence is beginning to trickle out that Dodd-Frank is a nothingburger. As Yves has already show regarding <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/11/the-false-dodd-frank-narrative-on-bank-profits-no-honey-obama-did-not-shrink-the-banks2.html">bank size and profits</a>, Dodd-Frank, unlike TARP, is not particularly relevant to trends in the financial services industry. We will keep hammering on the flaws in Dodd-Frank as the opportunities arise.</p></blockquote>

Dean Baker (and many others) of course has championed taking a more critical look at this set of issues for years.  But most readers know that &#8220;free market&#8221; is an election slogan and a <strike>metaphorica</strike>l  apocryphal story line rather than  something real for guiding either private companies or governments policies and rules.  On the other hand, that is the language used and something I hear from people in a non-critical way.</div>
<p>Copyright and patent rights need strong government to enforce the rules, and distort &#8220;pricing&#8221; mechanisms.   Yet it does not seem to be enough to cajole people into making a list of possible exceptions and then applying the rule of  &#8220;free&#8221;&#8230;if open to exception, where does it stop?  Often the question puts people to sleep, but is part of the bread and butter of real multinational companies.  And then enforcement falls to whom?  Who votes based on such details?  Trade policy hasn&#8217;t had traction for years.  </p>

<blockquote>A federal trial court ordered Mr. Kirtsaeng to pay $600,000 in damages for infringing on the Wiley copyright by reselling more than 600 copies of eight different books that he bought in Thailand. Mr. Kirtsaeng contends that the law allows him to resell the textbooks because he, family members and friends bought them legally and a principle called the first-sale doctrine, announced by the Supreme Court in a 1908 <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&#038;vol=210&#038;invol=339">ruling</a> and codified into law by Congress, says copyright owners cannot control the distribution and pricing of works, like books, after the initial sale.</p>
<p>But the Copyright Act <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/John_Wiley__Sons_v_Kirtsaeng_654_F3d_210_99_USPQ2d_1641_2d_Cir_20">prohibits</a> anyone from importing into the United States copyrighted works without the copyright holder’s approval. That provision would be seriously limited if copies of a work made abroad could be resold by importers in this country without constraint.</p>
<p>This case requires a difficult interpretation of the Copyright Act, but that is made easier by understanding the intent of Congress when it revised the law in 1976. It did so to broaden protection against unauthorized imports of copyrighted works by so-called gray-market sellers, and to make easier the kind of market segmentation by geography and price that Mr. Kirtsaeng’s resales subverted. With segmentation, book publishers can offer cheaper editions of their works in less-developed countries, without concern that those copies will be resold in the United States and unfairly undercut sales here. </p></blockquote>

<p> GOP didn&#8217;t like the study on impact of tax cuts on economic growth</p>
<p> The Congressional Research Service has long been respected as a non-partisan research organization that does in-depth studies as requested by Congress.  But when those non-partisan studies produce results that don&#8217;t jive with the right-wing mythology about tax cuts as the cure-all for slow economic growth, the right goes on the attack.</p>
<p>On September 14, 2012, the Congressional Research Service released a report by Tom Hungerford on the impact of tax cuts on economic growth.  Tom Hungerford,<a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/PDF/0915taxesandeconomy.pdf">Taxes and the Economy: An economic analysis of top tax rates since 1945</a> (CRS, Sept. 14, 2012). </p>
<p>Advocates of lower tax rates argue that reduced rates would increase economic growth, increase saving and investment, and boost productivity (increase the economic pie). Proponents of higher tax rates argue that higher tax revenues are necessary for debt reduction, that tax rates on the rich are too low (i.e., they violate the Buffett rule), and that higher tax rates on the rich would moderate increasing income inequality (change how the economic pie is distributed). This report attempts to clarify whether or not there is an association between the tax rates of the highest income taxpayers and economic growth.</p>
<p>This was an update of a report by Jane Gravelle and Donald J. Marples, <em>Tax Rates and Economic<em> Growth, CRS (</em></em>CRS Report R42111) and so was not an attempt to rewrite that report but to look only at the top tax rates.  </p>
<p>The Hungerford study didn&#8217;t find a correlation between lowering top tax rates and economic growth, but it did find one between lowering top tax rates and increasing inequality. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The share of income accruing to the top 0.1% of U.S. families increased from 4.2% in 1945 to 12.3% by 2007 before falling to 9.2% due to the 2007-2009 recession. The evidence does not suggest necessarily a relationship between tax policy withregard to the top tax rates and the size of the economic pie, but there may be a relationship to how the economic pie is sliced. Id.</p>
<p>That is in fact what one would expect, and increased inequality has its own harmful effects on the economy.<br />On September 17,  the Heritage Foundation squawked about the Hungerford study.  See <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2012/09/17/congressional-research-service-wrongly-implies-lower-tax-rates-dont-strengthen-economy/">Congressional Research Service Wrongly Implies Lower Tax Rates Don&#8217;t Strengthen Economy</a>, Heritage Foundation (Sept. 17, 2012).  Heritage acknowledges that the Hungerford report looks at a &#8220;slew of time periods&#8221; but it claims that the &#8220;simplistic correlations prove nothing.&#8221;  Id.  It suggests that since no two timeframes can be exactly the same, the correlations are meaningless.  If only the study had been tweaked the way the Heritage Foundation would have tweaked it, it would have supported Heritage&#8217;s position that lower tax rates on the top produce economic growth, it suggests.</p>
<p>But this is itself a simplistic analysis. The complaint that the paper didn&#8217;t take all the variables into account is a red herring.  The study offered a simple correlation study&#8211;looking just at the tax rates and economic growth, does a pattern emerge upholding the GOP view that tax cuts stimulate growth or not.  The answer is &#8220;not&#8221;.  Now, there are lots of other variables that could be considered&#8211;global warming, military involvement, and decaying infrastructure are all likely relevant to how we should spend our resources and likely also have a significant impact on the economy.  But self-serving assumptions about the &#8220;dynamic&#8221; effect of tax cuts are not.  For the broader view on tax rate analyses, Hungerford refers the reader to the 2011 Gravelle paper.  The problem with economic analyses in the market fundamentalist approach is that the answer can be manipulated by tweaking the selected data points, the time lag between policy and a change point, the way the discount rate is chosen, or whatever.   The Heritage position confuses savings and investment, missing the point that when interest rates are already down, savings can&#8217;t have much impact in reducing interest rates to make investment more attractive. </p>
<p>The  outcome of the right&#8217;s attack on a CRS study that came to a result it didn&#8217;t like is worrisome.  Instead of noting the limited goal of the paper (to see if there were correlations over time of tax rates and economic growth), the CRS yielded to pressure and pulled the study. See Jonathan Weisman, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/business/questions-raised-on-withdrawal-of-congressional-research-services-report-on-tax-rates.html?emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y">Nonpartisan Report Withdrawn after GOP Protest</a>, New York Times (Nov. 1, 2012). The withdrawal was counter to the recommendation of the service&#8217;s economic leaders. That says that CRS is vulnerable to pressure from those who want a study to show a particular outcome.  And that is not good.</p>

                                <p>Lifting some more from Angry Bear Robert Waldmann&#8217;s more personal musings at <i>Stochastic thoughts</i>:</p>
<p>Friday, November 02, 2012<br />I know I will regret this. I&#8217;m not drunk enough to do this yet (8:54 PM)<br />Now I am (9:30 PM)</p>
<p>If not specified I predict that the same caucus will keep the Senate seat (so for Connecticut the Democratic Caucus not the Connecticut for Lieberman party)</p>
<p>Senate</p>
<p>Maine&#8230;             King (I) who will caucus with Democrats<br />Massachusetts&#8230;Warren (D)<br />Virginia&#8230;           Kaine (D)<br />Florida &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Nelson (D)<br />Indiana &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Donnelly (D)<br />Missouri&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; McCaskill (D)<br />Wisconsin &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Baldwin (D)<br />Nebraska &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Fischer (R)<br />N Dakota &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Berg (R)<br />Montana &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Rehberg (R)<br />Arizona &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Carmona (D)<br />Nevada &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Heller (R)</p>
<p>Mostly I just predict the candidate who is ahead in the average poll will win.  For 6 races this margin is tiny and I think:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Virginia:  Some averages show this closer than close.  An important reason is a Roanoke College poll which shows Allen (R) up by 5.  Roanoke doesn&#8217;t poll outside of Virginia and doesn&#8217;t have much of a track record. Their numbers bounce around a lot.  I guess that they don&#8217;t do much demographic weighting so the sampling error is equal to the stated sampling error (most pollsters weight to make their sample of adults match census data on some dimensions reducing sampling error then ignore this when making cautious estimates of standard errors).  So I weight them less nudging Kaine into a lead. </p>
<p>In Wisconsin again the averages are very close with Baldwin very slightly ahead.   There are some pollsters which I suspect of overestimating Republican vote (Wenzel Strategies and Rasmussen).  This is enough to make me guess that she will slightly outperform the average poll which implies Senator Baldwin.</p>
<p>N Dakota is very close.  Without looking at polls I would guess a Republican is more likely to win.  The basically tied polling doesn&#8217;t move my posterior appreciably from this prior.</p>
<p>Montana is very close.  In spite of my gross error in 2004, I still have some sense that undecideds break against the incumbent (Tester (D)).  Also many polls name the libertarian.  I think slightly more people say they will vote for a no hope of winning third party candidate than actually throw their votes away and I assume that their second choice is Rehberg. </p>
<p>Carmona is slightly behind in Arizona.  I am counting on Hispanic citizens who are even more reluctant to talk to pollsters in English than to vote.</p>
<p>Nevada is close too, but not close enough for me to bet on the hard to poll Hispanics effect and the strength of trade unions and Democratic turn out the vote efforts.</p>
<p>New Senate guess is same as the old Senate with 51 Democrats 2 independents and 47 Republicans. </p>
<p>Update: ooops that&#8217;s embarrassing.  New Senate guess Democrats gain one with 52 Democrats 2 independents and 46 Republicans.  I see I agree with Nate Silver except on Indiana and Arizona.  I am quite confident about Indiana.  Silver&#8217;s model doesn&#8217;t consider whether there has been a big event like a candidate saying rape babies are gifts from God.  So the Howie DePauwe poll showing Donnelly ahead by 11 is just tossed in the smoothed average.  I am not at all confident about Arizona (or for that matter Montana where Silver gives Tester (D) a 33% chance).<br />/update</p>
<p>Sanders  will remain a more reliable Democrat than any Democrat.  King will cause the caucus about as much heart ache as Lieberman.    If my guesses are right, the Democratic caucus will move left with conservadem Ben Nelson gone, centrists Conrad and Tester gone, liberal Warren added, and mainstream Democrats added (2 replacing outgoing mainstream Democrats).  The Republican caucus would move to the right with moderate Snowe sometimes pseudo moderate Brown and not as extreme as Cruz anyway Hutchison gone.  So I guess the Senate will be less harmonious and more partisan hard as that is to imagine.</p>
<p>Warning.  My predictions are almost always wrong (my 2010 Senate predictions were correct).</p>

<p>Obama, Romney &#038; Enthusiasm</p>
<p>We live in lesser times.  The election is coming up, and our choices for President are pretty dismal.  I mean really, Barack Obama or Mitt Romney?  This is what it comes down to?  And the third party candidates, when one scratches below the surface, are not any better. An honest person must admit ample reasons to oppose everyone on the ballot.</p>
<p>With that said, there is one phenomenon about this election I find very curious.  Until Barack Obama came around, the only Presidents since the end of WW2 to increase the national debt as a percentage of GDP have been Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and the two Bushes.  So why is it that so many people who oppose Obama, who look to Reagan as a shining light, are yelling about financial responsibility and deficits?  They weren&#8217;t supporting Democrats since 1976, that is for sure, and it wasn&#8217;t that long ago that Dick Cheney told us boldly that that deficits don&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t get the economic concerns that Republicans have about Obama.  With the exception of Obamacare, essentially the same thing as Romneycare and very much based on a Heritage Foundation plan, Obama&#8217;s economic plan has been to continue GW&#8217;s policies.  Tax rates have been kept constant, right where GW left them.  The bailout was kept the same.  What exactly did he change?</p>
<p>Which leads to the same question for Democrats too:  what exactly did Obama change?  From where I&#8217;m standing, on the economic front, all I can point to is that Obama has, if anything, done less to rein in financial abuses than his predecessor did.  </p>

<p>After the dot com implosion, there were prosecutions.  After the much bigger mess from<br />2007 to 2009, crickets.  Similarly, when the dot com implosions were played out, none of the perpetrators were given handouts.  After the 2007 meltdown, not only did Obama continue GW&#8217;s bailout giveaways, he expanded them and has encouraged the Fed to do the same.  If there&#8217;s one class of Americans who are doing particularly well, its the folks who were most complicit in creating the mess the rest of the country is in.</p>
<p>I can say about the same thing with respect to social policies, foreign affairs, etc.  All of which is to say, there are a lot of people out demonizing one of the candidates, a candidate who is following their party&#8217;s prescription as well as any of their own party&#8217;s standard bearers, simply because he belongs to the other party.  And there are a lot of people supporting that candidate, that candidate who in deeds stands against what they stand for, simply because he is, nominally a member of their party.  The reason we live in lesser times is because, collectively, we are lesser people.</p>
<p>The other day I held my nose, scratched off a mark next to the name of the marginally lesser of the two evils (I originally planned to have a blank vote for President, but the other evil worries me more than I expected), and mailed in my absentee ballot.  I won&#8217;t advise you on whom to vote, but I would, strongly suggest that you not kid yourself.  If, like me, you are holding your nose, don&#8217;t pretend you are doing it with a lot of enthusiasm.  The stakes surrounding this election are far smaller than the stakes surrounding how we, the people, behave when it comes to politics.</p>

                                <p>
<div>Yesterday in Springfield, Ohio, the crowd listening to Barack Obama booed when the President brought up Mitt Romney and the Republican Congress. That prompted Obama to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/11/02/remarks-president-springfield-oh" target="_blank">say</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“No, no, no — don’t boo, vote. Vote! Voting is the best revenge.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney promptly pretended to be very outraged by this. He <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/11/03/romney_vote_for_love_of_country_not_revenge.html" target="_blank">told his supporters</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Yesterday, the President said something you may have heard by now. That I think surprised a lot of people. Speaking to an audience, he said, ‘voting is the best revenge.’ He told his supporters — voting for revenge. Vote for revenge? Let me tell you what I’d like to tell you. Vote for love of country.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/romney-closes-big-love-of-country-vs.-revenge/article/2512532#.UJarSobDilE" target="_blank">picked up that refrain a second time</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Did you see what President Obama said today? He asked his supporters to vote for revenge — for revenge&#8230;Instead, I ask the American people to vote for love of country.”
</p>
</div>
<div>           
</p>
</div>
<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/">Mitt Romney insults the Americanelectorate one last time</a></i>, Greg Sargent, Washington Post, today
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>For me, one of the most frustrating aspects of this campaign is the failure of Obama and of the news media, time and again, to pretend to accept at face value that when Romney misinterprets the meaning of a word, a phrase or a fact, it because Romney really thinks that that’s what the word, the phrase, the fact <i>means</i> or <i>indicates</i>. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>There are now only one-and-one-half days of campaigning left.  <i>Pleeease</i>, Mr. Obama: Ask people whether they really want a commander-in-chief and a budget-and-tax-policymaker who thinks that “voting is the best revenge” means “vote for <i>policies</i> of revenge.” 
</p>

<div>English is not this guy’s second language.  And he attended a fancy college-prep school, Stanford University, Brigham Young University, Harvard Law School and Harvard’s graduate school of business.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here’s betting that he learned his English-language interpretation skills in law school and business school. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>If you get my drift.  And I bet you do.

<p><a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/the-real-barrier-to-tax-reform/">Bruce Bartlett</a> goes off on some of the denialist behavior from the GOP. Bartlett writes: When a study doesn’t support their dogma, the GOP censors it: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/business/questions-raised-on-withdrawal-of-congressional-research-services-report-on-tax-rates.html">Nonpartisan Tax Report Withdrawn After G.O.P.

<p>Bartlett discussed how Republicans destroyed much of Congress’s analytical ability when they took over in 1995: <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/gingrich-and-the-destruction-of-congressional-expertise/">Gingrich and the Destruction of Congressional Expertise</a><br />He adds “This is part and parcel with poll denialism, global warming denialism, and the general right wing disdain for facts and reality.”</p>
<p>Note: Before making any kneejerk partisan reaction to this, note that Bartlett — Like Stockman and others — sre not trying to mske a pro-Democrat argument; rather, they are acknowledging a major societal concern when one of the 2 major political parties have foresaken science and reality and facts when they disagree with their agenda.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Dan here&#8230;I am willing to bet this is a non-partisan issue to some extent and age old way of supporting agendas&#8230;but if data cannot be trusted to have a bit of independence, where does that leave us?)</p>

<p>Health Care Thoughts: Business Model Angst</p>
<p>For the past two months I have been absorbed more so than usual in health care strategic and regulatory compliance issues. One of the top trends is the scramble for a workable business model for providers. The announcement this week of the Beaumont system merger with the Henry Ford system in Detroit is a good example.</p>
<p>Integration and consolidation are clearly the early winners, although the Obama administration still has not gotten the DOJ and FTC on the same page with Health and Human Services.<br />Integration is supposed to pave the way for innovative payment systems, better data accumulation and better clinical quality. The jury is still out.</p>
<p>In a somewhat related note, I have heard a similar comment from all over the country &#8211; rolling out electronic medical records tied into networks (EHR) is a slow, expensive, agonizing process.</p>

<p>In no particular order our current economists and contributors in macro, micro, and finance are Mike Kimel, Ken Houghton, Spencer England, Robert Waldmann, Linda Beale (tax and law),  Rebecca Wilder (The Wilder View at Economonitor), Steve Roth and Jazzbumpa.  Bruce Webb has added his nationally recognized expertise in particular on Social Security.. Beverly Mann writes on Supreme Court proceedings.  Mike Halasy and Tom Ealy cover the health industry. Dan Becker offers his perspective as a owner of two small businesses.</p>
<p>Mostly in alphabetical order:</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Crawford</strong>:  aka Rdan owns, designs, moderates, and manages Angry Bear since 2007. </p>
<p><strong>Linda Beale: </strong> Linda is a law professor at Wayne State University Law School who teaches various courses in the area of federal income tax, such as introduction to federal income tax, corporate taxation, partnership taxation, international taxation and perhaps in the future a course in statutory interpretation focussed on tax. </p>
<p>Her philosophy is that &#8220;the tax system should reflect the values of ordinary Americans and our long-held belief in principles of liberty, equality and community. I fear that we have instead tended to give too much credence to purportedly &#8220;objective&#8221; ideas about taxation based on the rationales of law and economics and unverified theories about economic growth, and too little credence to human needs for community that require allocating the burdens and benefits of the tax system fairly among the people and entities that make up our system.&#8221; She maintains her own blog <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/" target="_blank">ataxingmatter</a> as well.</p>
<p>Dan Becker:</p>
<p><strong>Tom Ealey</strong> (aka Save the Rustbelt):  Rusty Rustbelt aka save_the_rustbelt aka Tom Ealey has had a career as a CPA,  management consultant, health care executive, college lecturer, researcher,  technical writer, seminar leader and litigation analyst (after factory and  construction laborer and union member). He is currently resisting retirement as  a college lecturer, writer, researcher, seminar leader, occasional accountant,  advisory committee member, church finance director and occasional day laborer.  He is married to &#8220;the world&#8217;s greatest nurse,&#8221; is a doting grandfather and is  currently starting a publishing company.</p>
<p><strong>Spencer England:</strong> Before I started my own consulting business I was an economist for the CIA for 10 years and worked for a couple of Boston investment management firms as their in house economist, investment strategist for some 12 years. My original field of study was international economics and international finance. I just celebrated the 25th anniversary of publishing <a href="http://econseer.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">SEER</a> &#8212; my equity strategy product. I model the S&#038;P industries and advise portfolio managers on how to structure their portfolios by recommending industry weights.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Mike Halasy:</p>
<p><strong>Ken Houghton:</strong> A principle in his own company and former economist for several major financial companies.</p>
<p>Jazzbumpa:</p>
<p><strong>Mike Kimel</strong>: An economist for a private corporation and author of <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=3" target="_blank">Presimetrics blog</a> and the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579128351?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=angr0b-20&#038;link_code=as3&#038;camp=211189&#038;creative=373489&#038;creativeASIN=1579128351" target="_blank">Presimetrics: How Democratic and Republican Administrations Measure Up on the Issues We Care About</a> published August,  2010.</p>
<p>Beverly Mann:</p>
<p>Steve Roth:  Steve Roth is a serial entrepreneur whose businesses have ranged from book and magazine publishing to high-tech professional conferences to corporate services. He is self-taught in economics over many years, with great help from the remarkable community of the econoblogosphere, and of course the traditional sources of textbooks and published econ papers. </p>
<p>Steve&#8217;s publications include &#8220;Capital in the American Economy Since 1930: Kuznets Revisited,&#8221; an appendix to James Livingston&#8217;s <i>Against Thrift: Why Consumer Culture is Good for the Economy, the Environment, and Your Soul. </i>That appendix and supporting data are available <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/capital-in-the-american-economy-since-1930-kuznets-revisited.html">here</a>. Steve has been blogging at <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/">Asymptosis</a> since 2004. He&#8217;s also a self-described and variously published Shakespeare dweeb; his Shakespeare scholarship is viewable at <a href="http://princehamlet.com/">princehamlet.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Waldmann:</strong> &#8230;born the day after Kennedy was elected (November 9 1960). I have a PhD in economics (Harvard 1989) and teach economics at the University of Rome &#8220;Tor Vergata&#8221;. I wasn&#8217;t always like this. I have a bachelor&#8217;s degree in biology. Oddly, I don&#8217;t blog much at my own site <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/">rjwaldmann</a> about economics or Italy. Currently, I am obsessed with Obama, but I&#8217;ll try not to bore people with stuff they already read 10 times today. As an economist (roughly) I am interested in behavioral economics, growth, and the economics of inequality. Actually much of my current research, such as it is, is really in econometric methodology and statistics. I was very unorthodox in the 80s, but the orthodoxy is much less rigid now.</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Webb: </strong>I am by training a historian and mythologist who then has spent my working career in information retrieval and land use regulation. My interest in Social Security arose when I noticed in passing that the dates related to &#8216;crisis&#8217; were moving but that nobody seemed to be noticing that and still less asking the key questions &#8216;why?&#8217; and &#8216;can this go on?&#8217; So I set out to try to answer those questions and then share the results which somehow led to a gig here at AB. Politically I am somewhat left of left of center and could best be described as a &#8216;New Dealer&#8217; and so weigh in on more overtly political questions as the opportunity arises.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca Wilder: </strong> She writes her own column, <strong>The Wilder View</strong>, at Nouriel Roubini&#8217;s <em>Economonitor</em> as well.  After receiving my Doctorate in Economics, I was an assistant professor for two years. However, I realized that teaching just wasn&#8217;t for me and took a job in private sector. Now, I am an Economist in the financial industry. As an economist in finance, I analyze data, write commentary, and offer economic insight to traders, chiefs of staff, and really anyone who wants my opinion. It is in this job that I developed a fancy for writing, but mostly I love talking about economics to anyone who will listen.</p>
<p><strong>History of Angry Bear:</strong> Written by Cactus</p>
<p>The eponymous Angry Bear blog is the brainchild of&#8230; Angry Bear (&#8220;AB&#8221;), who founded the blog in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003/02/income-and-consumption-so-heres.html">February of 2003</a>. The title of the blog reflects his emotional reaction (anger) to his view of the state (bearish) of the state of the economy when the blog was founded. Sadly, he had cause to maintain that sentiment for quite a while.  Kash Mansori joined the blog in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003/08/recognizing-obvious-i-liked-this.html">August 2003</a>, and PGL arrived <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/06/national-review-v.html">a year later</a>.</p>
<p>AB, Kash, and PGL formed the core of the blog for many years. Each has a Ph.D. in economics, but AB&#8217;s focus is on microeconomic issues, Kash&#8217;s are in macroeconomic issues, and PGL&#8217;s training is in finance. Neither AB nor Kash has posted here in a while, but we hold out hope for their eventual return. We also hold out hope for the return of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/another-budget-another-disaster.html">CR</a>, who posted for several years at both Angry Bear and his own blog, <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">Calculated Risk</a>. However, we can at least continue to enjoy his insights on real estate, housing, and banking trends, and economic indicators at the Calculated Risk blog.</p>
<p>Since 2006, Angry Bear has added more regulars &#8211; some have remained, some have stayed for a while and then moved on.  Former regulars include  <strong>Stormy,</strong> <strong>Tom Bozzo</strong>, and Noni Mausa.</p>
