                            <div class="content">
                                <p>According to Center on Budget and Policy Priority data cited by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/us/how-local-taxpayers-bankroll-corporations.html?ref=louisestory&#038;_r=0">Louise Story</a>,  in 2011 the states enacted $156 billion of austerity measures, between  budget cuts and tax hikes. Despite their budgetary woes, however, this  did not stop them from throwing billions of dollars a year into the  worst kind of corporate subsidy, relocation incentives that move  existing facilities from one state to another without creating any new  jobs. A <a href="http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/sites/default/files/docs/pdf/shellgame.pdf">new report</a> from Good Jobs First documents their widespread use, which is <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/02/bad-trends-in-economic-development-weak.html">far more common</a> than most people would imagine.</p>
<p>One great aspect of this report is that it goes beyond the two examples of <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/07/new-good-jobs-first-study-shows-micro.html">interstate border wars</a> we hear the most about, New York-New Jersey-Connecticut and  Kansas-Missouri. We learn about Texas and Georgia vs. the world, North  Carolina-South Carolina (especially in the Charlotte metro area),  Tennessee-Mississippi (particularly with Memphis as target), and Rhode  Island-Massachusetts. In addition, we learn more about the flip side of  job piracy, retention subsidies, of which <a href="http://clawback.org/2012/02/20/sears-now-come-the-penalty-free-headquarters-layoffs/">Sears&#8217; two in Illinois</a> are the most egregious.</p>
<p>For  example, Continental Tire moved its North American headquarters and 320  jobs from Charlotte to Lancaster County, South Carolina, in 2009.  Georgia gave Ohio-based NCR Corp. (formerly National Cash Register) $109  million to relocate that same year. In 2010, Hamilton Beach received at  least $2 million to move from Memphis to Olive Branch, Mississippi,  while in 2009 McKesson received $4 million from Mississippi in addition  to local incentives to move from Memphis to neighboring DeSoto County.  Rhode Island, in a widely publicized move, gave Boston Red Sox pitcher  Curt Schilling&#8217;s video game company 38 Studios a $75 million loan to  move from Massachusetts in 2009, only to see the  firm go bankrupt in  2012. There are many more examples in the report, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>The  existence of relocation subsidies makes it possible for companies to  demand incentives to stay in a particular state, i.e., retention  subsidies. Two of the three largest ones went to Sears in Illinois, $168  million in 1989 and another $275 million in 2012 when the 1989 deal  expired. The second largest was $250 million to Prudential Insurance  from New Jersey in 2011. But many more states have had to shell out  retention subsidies on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The report  notes that at least 40 states know how to write no-raiding language into  their subsidy programs, because they already have such language banning  intra-state relocations from receiving subsidies under various  programs. However, as far as I know, far fewer states prevent their  cities from giving relocation subsidies to in-state firms, though the  report shows that Maine&#8217;s Employment Tax Increment Financing rules do  provide that.</p>
<p>What is necessary, the report argues and I  wholeheartedly agree, is that states need to tweak their program  language to stop rewarding interstate job relocation as well. They need  to stop efforts to directly poach existing firms, something Texas is  heavily engaged in. The report says there is a &#8220;possible&#8221; federal role  here, to withhold some Department of Commerce monies from states that  engaged in job piracy. I, on the other hand, think that federal action  is the only way it will happen. As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/07/new-good-jobs-first-study-shows-micro.html">written before</a>,  voluntary state efforts in the 1980s and 1990s to end job piracy have  been utter failures, and the states clearly need an outside enforcement  mechanism, which can only be provided by the federal government.</p>
<p>With  such extensive documentation of how widespread relocation and retention  subsidies are, hopefully more people can be mobilized to get the  federal action we need.</p>

<div dir="ltr">The final problem is that, in an effort to reduce the economic concentration of power, the administration is concentrating political power in Washington. If the problem is that talent is fleeing blighted localities, it’s hard to see how you make that better if decision-making and resources are concentrated faraway in the nation’s capital.</div>
<div dir="ltr">This is not to make a partisan point. The Republicans do not have a better approach. It’s simply to say that the liberal agenda is not very good at addressing the inequality problem it seeks to solve. The meritocracy is overwhelming the liberal project.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/opinion/brooks-the-great-migration.html">The Great Migration</a>, David Brooks, New York Times, Jan. 25</p>
</div>
<p>Brooks is right; that is not to make a partisan point.  It is to make a nonsensensical point. A point that Brooks makes again in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/opinion/brooks-a-second-g-o-p.html?_r=0">his column in today&#8217;s Times</a>, if in different words. </p>
<p>It is, in any event, an inaccurate point.  </p>
<p>Okay, I admit it: I’ve become obsessed with David Brooks.  Or, more specifically, with the fact that a New York Times columnist who is regularly referenced by other big-name political columnists and bloggers, operates under a formula in which everything even remotely connected to politics/ideology&#8211;and I do mean everything, best as I can tell&#8211;falls within one or another breathtakingly broad factual category.  The placement into one or another of these categories depends not on whether the category placement is even remotely accurate as a matter of logic or even (sometimes) actual fact, but instead on which category whatever he’s talking about must fit in order to advance his preference for the decentralization of … well … everything, I guess, other than corporate power.  But especially of government functions. </p>
<p>This is so even when he’s arguing in favor of stronger centralization of government functions and of more government functions, but doesn’t realize it.  As, for example, his invocation of the public’s overwhelming support for Social Security and Medicare as … yup! … evidence that “Americans are still skeptical of Washington,” and so “[i]f you shove a big government program down their throats they will recoil.”  An accurate statement if the Americans you’re talking about are the ones who want the government to stay out of their Medicare!  Otherwise, though, there isn’t much evidence that there’s been an 80-year-long recoiling from Social Security and a 45-year recoiling from Medicare, and a populist push to privatize those programs or, to borrow a phrase from Mitt Romney (specifically when talking about emergency disaster aid and Medicaid, but, clearly, he had other programs in mind, too&#8211;like almost all federal programs that don’t directly aide, say, the oil and gas production companies&#8211;send them back to the states.  From which they didn’t come, in the first place.</p>
<p>The two indented paragraphs above come at the end of a column summarizing a new book called The New Geography of Jobs, by Enrico Moretti, with whom Brooks expressly agrees, point after point, paragraph after paragraph.  Until he adds a point of his own, the one he identifies as the final problem.  The one that Brooks thinks cannot be solved by federal money and decisionmaking, because that money would be concentrated in&#8211;by which he means, originates from&#8211;Washington, and because decisionmaking about how to turn this dynamic around, so that localities other than the big tech and finance centers prosper too, would, if the liberals have their way, be concentrated in Washington.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Brooks sums up the problem. Sort of:</p>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The highly educated cluster around a few small nodes. Decade after decade, smart and educated people flock away from Merced, Calif., Yuma, Ariz., Flint, Mich., and Vineland, N.J. In those places, less than 15 percent of the residents have college degrees. They flock to Washington, Boston, San Jose, Raleigh-Durham and San Francisco. In those places, nearly 50 percent of the residents have college degrees.</div>
<div dir="ltr">As Enrico Moretti writes in “The New Geography of Jobs,” the magnet places have positive ecologies that multiply innovation, creativity and wealth. The abandoned places have negative ecologies and fall further behind.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">This sorting is self-reinforcing, and it seems to grow more unforgiving every year. One small study caught my eye. Robert Oprisko of Butler University found that half of the jobs in university political science programs went to graduates of the top 11 schools. That is to say, if you have a Ph.D. from Harvard, Stanford, Princeton and so on, your odds of getting a job are very good. If you earned your degree from one of the other 100 degree-granting universities, your odds are not. These other 100 schools don’t even want to hire the sort of graduates they themselves produce. They want the elite credential.</p>
</div>
<p>Brooks is good at using other people’s fact-based arguments.  He just isn’t good at figuring out what they mean.  Or at least what they don’t mean.  Butler University is in Indianapolis, Ind. Presumably, Oprisko and all his colleagues live nearby.  The University of Michigan has a large branch in Flint.  The members of its political science faculty probably live within a relatively small radius of Flint.  So this wasn’t a good example of Moretti’s point, an all-too-valid one that highlights a huge national truth.  A truth that surely cannot be solved by removing whatever funds and help the federal government might offer.  </p>
<p>The federal government is not keeping Flint and the other, similar localities around the country, from doing things that might change the economics dynamic so that their young people will be better educated and will want to return there after receiving their degrees.  The federal government is being concertedly demonized as a beast, and starved&#8211;the result of the Republican dominance of Washington policymaking for so long.  And, for the same reason, the federal government’s entire fiscal policymaking apparatus has been prevented from attempting to deal with the problems Moretti discusses (and Brooks purports to discuss) by the capture of the public policymaking dialogue by people who want to end or prevent the federal-government’s role in, among many other things, the very sort of problem-solving that Brooks says is needed, except by … who?  Or by what?  Corporations?  Local governments?  Rush Limbaugh? </p>
<p>Brooks, as is typical of him, doesn’t say.  He just says, as always, that “centralized”&#8211;by which he means, federal government&#8211;power is bad.  He doesn’t like it.  Too much like Europe, you know.  Very bad. </p>
<p>Brooks didn’t write a Sunday column this week.  I figured he just <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/does-david-brooks-really-think-student.html">didn’t want me to mock</a> another of his mindless rants about liberal/Obama government/centralized-headquarters-controlled operations that would undermine creativity and initiative&#8211;such as student-loan programs and public universities&#8211;so he took the day off.  But instead it turns out that he didn’t write a Sunday column because he was too busy attending various luncheons, dinners, and other meetings at this decade’s <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/national_review_post_election_summit_conservatives_descend_on_the_magazine.html">National Review review</a> this past weekend about what the hell went WRONG last November, and what the hell can BE DONE to avoid such unfortunate turns of fortune from recurring repeatedly in the coming, say, century. </p>
<p>Brooks recounts pieces of arguments of speakers at the conference, and he concludes, surely accurately, that the Republican Party can’t win unless it develops what he calls a “Second GOP,” lead by new politicians who are not anti-government. These folks would develop federal programs that would address the country’s and individuals’ actual problems.  The quest for actual solutions, in other words, would trump anti-government ideology.  It’s just that, as standard bearers for the GOP, albeit the Second one,  they would have to pretend that federal programs, like Social Security and Medicare, aren’t big government programs.  Or even small government programs.  They would pretend, I guess, that federal government programs aren’t federal government programs.  State programs, maybe?  Local-government programs? Chamber of Commerce programs?</p>
<p>This would work, remember, because most Americans “recoil” from big (i.e.., federal) government programs. Which is why they “cherish” Social Security and Medicare.  Just so you don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve removed a sentence or clause from its context, here’s the full paragraph:</p>
<div dir="ltr">Americans are still skeptical of Washington. If you shove a big government program down their throats they will recoil. But many of their immediate problems flow from globalization, the turmoil of technological change and social decay, and they’re looking for a bit of help. Moreover, given all the antigovernment rhetoric, they will never trust these Republicans to reform cherished programs like Social Security and Medicare. You can’t be for entitlement reform and today’s G.O.P., because politically the two will never go together. </div>
<p>The Second GOP, Brooks says, “would be filled with people who recoiled at President Obama’s second Inaugural Address because of its excessive faith in centralized power, but who don’t share the absolute antigovernment story of the current G.O.P.”  People who, for example, live in Merced, Calif., Yuma, Ariz., Flint, Mich., and Vineland, N.J., and would be outraged if the Obama administration offered programs and federal financing to try to assist their cities in upgrading their education and infrastructure systems enough that they again become attractive to companies and startups and young professionals. Some of whom, recall, cherish Social Security and Medicare because of their lack of centralized power.</p>
<p>What exactly does Brooks think is an example of Obama’s excessive faith in centralized power?  The operative word here is, example. Even just one or two specific ones, please.  He doesn’t say; after all, generalization and sweeping categorization is his stock in trade. But if he can, and does, eventually provide an example, he might, while he’s on a role, consider identifying a couple of decentralized-power success stories, and explaining why Merced, Calif., Yuma, Ariz., Flint, Mich., and Vineland, N.J., don’t seem to have had similar options.  </p>
<p>Or maybe he can persuade the Second GOP to explain it. Without making too many of us recoil.  </p>
<p>&#8212;<br />UPDATE: Reader Jack and I exchanged the following comments in the Comments thread below:</p>
<div dir="ltr">Jack: </div>
<div dir="ltr">Beverly</div>
<div dir="ltr">Believe me when I say that I share your feelings about Brooks. He is one of the worst of the sycophants of the upper crust, and he is little more than the crumbs that make up that crust. However, the nearly total lack of response to your long post in the past several hours is the best response of all. He is not worthy of criticism. Posting anything he writes is like disposing of feces with your bare hands. Don&#8217;t dirty yourself by acknowledging that you&#8217;ve actually read some of his deceitful meanderings. When you see his column in print take that page and clean some crap off the sidewalk so that at least that page will serve a useful purpose.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">If you must write about him then do so in a brief letter to the managing Editor of the Times and note that the Times should find a more fact based apologist for the takers in our society. Don&#8217;t multiply his words through the process of criticism. It serves no useful purpose because criticism is meant to correct or improve a point of view. He has no capacity for either.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Me:</div>
<div dir="ltr">My instinct is to just say, “But, Jack, you don’t understand.  This is an obsession!”  But I think it’s not a trivial matter that a very high-profile, self-styled “center-right” (as opposed to just plain rightwing), political columnist&#8211;someone whom politicians and other political journalists read and take seriously&#8211;keeps pushing a flatly nonsensical supposedly-factual, but generic “narrative”&#8211;over and over and over again&#8211;while never actually identifying specifics to support his claim of fact: that Obama and the congressional Dems are pushing for federal programs that would undermine creativity and initiative because they would be federal programs rather than state or local programs&#8211;or something&#8211;and that ongoing government programs such as student loan programs and state university systems do the same because they are government rather than private programs&#8211;or something.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">These are representations of fact, not statements of opinion.  They either are unpinned by empirical evidence or they are not.  And of course they are not.  So why does the New York Times allow him to keep asserting these things, in column after column, without finally asking him to identify specifics that support his generic claims of fact?  Yes, he’s an opinion columnist.  But these things aren’t opinion; they’re either fact-based or they aren’t, and if they aren’t, why is he allowed to use the Times as his forum to keep saying that they are, without ever actually identifying any empirical evidence to support them, or even specifying rather than merely implying) what programs he’s talking about.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Two weeks ago, New York Magazine writer Jonathan Chait wrote <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/01/david-brooks-now-totally-pathological.html">a delicious article</a> there titled “David Brooks Now Totally Pathological,” hilariously deconstructing Brooks’s then-most-recent column in which he angrily blamed Obama for the Republicans’ fiscal-cliff and debt-ceiling embarrassments because Obama didn’t cave to them.  But that column of Brooks’s was, clearly, just opinion.  Hilariously and flagrantly ridiculous opinion.  It wasn’t a misrepresentation of fact. Quite the opposite; it acknowledged that the Republicans lost the substantive and political endgame on both.  It just said it was Obama’s fault.  Which is true. </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Chait’s article is … a don’t-miss. </div>
<div>&#8212;-<br />FOLLOW-UP: In response to Jack’s reply to me in the Comments thread in which he criticized the New York Times as basically a shill for the wealthy, I wrote:</p>
<div dir="ltr">I like the New York Times, generally. That&#8217;s where Paul Krugman&#8217;s column and blog are published, after all. And I&#8217;m not suggesting that the editors should censor their columnists&#8217; opinions. But when a political columnist repeatedly makes sweeping conclusory statements of fact without ever actually specifying the supposed factual basis for the claims, and when it&#8217;s patently clear that no factual basis for the claims exists, it does seem to me that that crosses a line. …</div>
<p>I want to be sure that my criticism of the Times on this is not misunderstood. </div>

                                <p>These local stories in Louisiana, Kansas, Nebraska, and North Carolina speak quite eloquently for themselves.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gov. Bobby Jindal is proposing to eliminate Louisiana’s income and corporate taxes and pay for those cuts with increased sales taxes</p>

<blockquote><p>Gov. Dave Heineman made a bold proposal … end the income tax for working Nebraskans and corporations. It would also end the taxation of small business, Social Security and retirement income. … As a means to make up for the lost revenue, Heineman’s proposal would also end $5 billion in sales tax exemptions.</p>

<blockquote><p>State personal and corporate income taxes would be eliminated, sales taxes would be charged on services, and North Carolinians would pay state sales tax on groceries under a tax reform proposal with significant support in Raleigh.</p>

<p>These proposals all lower revenues collected. This will give these red states more bargaining power when they run into the inevitable fiscal crisis, so they can suck the Federal government teat even more effectively than they do now.</p>
<p>Fiendishly clever.</p>

<p>The future of YOUR health insurance premiums</p>
<p>Today, many Americans are asking, “Will my premiums go up in 2014?”</p>
<p>There is no simple answer.</p>
<p>According to Families USA, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will have a <a href="http://familiesusa2.org/assets/pdfs/health-reform/helping-families/National-Report.pdf">positive effect on the typical family’s budget</a>. Using an economic model that can factor in all provisions of the Act, Family’s USA estimates that by 2019, when the law is fully implemented, “the average household will be $1,571 better off.”<br />Even high-income families will save: thanks to rules that limit co-pays, and reward providers for becoming more efficient, “those earning $100,000 to $250,000″ will spend $779 less on medical care.”<br />But these are “averages.” They don’t tell you whether your premiums will rise or fall.</p>
<p>The answer will depend on: your income, your age, your gender, whether a past illness or injury has been labeled a <a href="http://www.healthinsurance.org/glossary/pre-existing-conditions/">pre-existing condition</a>, who you work for, and what type of insurance you have now:</p>
<p>If you work for a large company:</p>
<p>The ACA will have a “negligible” <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/107xx/doc10781/11-30-premiums.pdf">effect on your premiums</a> says the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).<br />This doesn’t mean that your costs won’t climb in 2014. As long as medical product-makers and providers continue to raise prices, premiums will edge up each year.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But in 2012 average premiums for employer-based insurance rose by just 3 percent for single coverage and 4 percent for families, a “<a href="http://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2012/02/13/health-care-cost-increase-lowest-in-50-years/">modest increase</a>” when compared to 8 percent to 12 percent jumps in past years. And on average, <a href="http://ehbs.kff.org/pdf/2012/8345.pdf">employee co-pays and deductibles remained flat</a>.</p>
<p>Granted, a 3 percent to 4 percent increase still <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/11/pf/insurance/health-insurance-premiums/index.html">outpaces growth in workers’ wages</a> (1.7 percent percent) and general inflation (2.3 percent) percent). But as <a href="http://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2012/09/29/the-next-step-for-obamacare/">reform reins in spending</a>, annual increases for large groups could fall to 2 percent – or less.</p>
<p>If you work for a small company with more than 50 employees:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2012/12/01/can-businesses-really-not-afford-obamacare/">Your boss will be more likely to offer affordable benefits</a>, in part because, if he doesn’t, he will have to pay a penalty.</p>
<p>Moreover, he will find insurance less expensive. Today, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea/Health-Care-Reform-and-Small-Businesses">small businesses pay 18 percent more than large companies</a> because the administrative costs of hand-selling plans to small groups are sky-high.<br />But starting in 2014, businesses with fewer than 100 employees will begin buying insurance in exchanges where they will become part of a large group, and eligible for lower rates.</p>
<p>Finally, some <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/employers/small-employer-tax-credit/index.html">companies with fewer than 25 employees will receive subsidies</a> that cover 50 percent of what they lay out for insurance.</p>
<p>If you work for a small firm where many employees are older, female, or suffer from a pre-existing condition:</p>
<p>Your premiums may well fall. Today, most states let <a href="http://www.acscan.org/pdf/healthcare/imple%20mentation/background/NewFederalRatingRules.pdf">insurers charge small firms more if many of their workers are older or are women</a>.  They also can jack up premiums <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/resources/reports/preexisting.html">if just a few workers fall ill or are injured</a>.</p>

<p>The Netherlands&#8217; role as corporate tax haven a &#8220;stain on the nation&#8217;s reputation&#8221;</p>
<p>As Europe, the US, and other countries continue to face sluggish economies in the midst of extraordinarily high corporate profits, substantial accumulation of new wealth in the hands of even fewer people, and inordinate influence of corporatist approaches on democratic governance, a public backlash is growing and legislatures are beginning to notice.</p>
<p>Here in the US, President Obama&#8217;s second inauguration speech acknowledged the necessity of cooperative approaches to the dire problems we face today.  Those problems&#8211; poverty, limited opportunity due to lowerclass status, lack of educational access, climate change and infrastructure needs&#8211;all relate to the increasing inequality among our people, the ability of the wealthy to buy secure and safe lifestyles for themselves while the majority are left to struggle with potential loss of jobs, homes and health.  People are starting to notice the inordinate power of huge multinational corporations and their owners due to the influence of wealth and the way the wealthy have been able to capture almost all of the gains of the last few decades for themselves.  Perhaps we are on the cusp of a new populism that will reclaim the American economy and the American system for ordinary people.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, the backlash against unfair tax policies may be happening even more clearly than here.  The Netherlands has become an infamous tax haven for corporate giants (renowned for using the &#8220;Dutch sandwich&#8221; structure to avoid taxation).  Yahoo&#8217;s arrangement, described by Jesse Drucker in a Bloomberg story today, illustrates the problem perfectly.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Inside Reindert Dooves’ home, a 17th century, three-story converted warehouse along the Zaan canal in suburban Amsterdam, a 21st-century Internet giant is avoiding taxes.  The bookkeeper’s home office doubles as the headquarters for a Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) offshore unit. Through this sun-filled, white walled room, Yahoo has taken advantage of the law to quietly funnel hundreds of millions of dollars in global profits to island subsidiaries, cutting its worldwide tax bill.<br />The Yahoo arrangement illustrates that the Netherlands, in the heart of a continent better known for social welfare than corporate welfare, has emerged as one of the most important tax havens for multinational companies.</p>
<p>Jesse Drucker, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-23/yahoo-dell-swell-netherlands-13-trillion-tax-haven.html">Yahoo, Dell Swell Netherlands $13 Trillion Tax Haven</a>, Bloomberg.com (Jan. 23, 2013).  Many of the Dutch companies created by MNEs like Yahoo, Google, Merck, and Dell are sham companies that &#8220;only exist on paper&#8221;.  $10.2 trillion dollars went through 14,300 of those sham companies in 2010. Id.  Merck has 54 subsidiaries in the Netherlands and routed more than 7 billion euros in royalties between 2002 and 2010 through an Amsterdam subsidiary that has no employees.  Id.</p>
<p>The Labour Party and People&#8217;s Party for Freedom and Democracy took power in November and are &#8220;fed up with these so-called PO Box companies&#8221;, according to a parliamentarian from Labour.  Id.  Another parliamentarian (from the Dutch Socialist Party) noted that while governments are cutting their budgets, multinationals are avoiding taxes, and the Netherlands is functioning as a connecter to the tax havens.</p>
<p>The anti-tax avoidance concern is growing across advanced nations. As the article notes, the European Commission, has also noted the problems with tax avoidance and evasion and has advised its member states to adopt anti-abuse rules.  Similarly, the OECD is discussing a proposal to make it harder for companies to use shams like the Dutch sandwich structure to shuffle profits into tax haven islands and avoid taxes in OECD countries.  And the UK has scheduled a second parliamentary hearing this month on the issue.  Id.</p>
<p>Tax treaties are supposed to protect companies from double taxation on the same income by two different jursidictions, but tax lawyers have developed sophisticated structures that allow companies to enjoy double non-taxation.  The article describes Dell&#8217;s use of a Netherlands subsidiary (with no Netherlands employees) to claim credit for about three-fourth&#8217;s of Dell&#8217;s worldwide income and achieve substantial tax savings&#8211;about $4 billion since 2004.  Id.  The US Is challenging Dell&#8217;s claim that it is appropriately using the Netherlands and Singapore arrangement to avoid US taxes.</p>
<p>And of course these same MNE giants are the ones that are accumulating billions overseas on which they are seeking special legislation to allow them to repatriate cash to the US at low (or negative) taxes. See earlier Angry Bear and ataxingmatter posts on this issue.</p>
<p>Hopefully, even the Republicans in Congress will realize that this corporate game of tax avoidance using international subsidiaries that have no employees is a sham and will take action to eliminate loopholes that permit hugely profitable companies to pay minimal corporate taxes.</p>

<p>Health Care Thoughts: PPACA Health Exchange Oops</p>
<p>On March 1, 2013 employers were supposed to notify employees in writing of information relating to the health insurance exchanges, including a 1) description of services, 2) employee eligibility for a premium tax credit IF the employee purchases an exchange insurance product, and 3) the downside of the employee purchasing through the exchange.</p>
<p>On January 24<sup>th</sup> the Department of Labor announced the suspension of the notice rule, because there is very little guidance currently available, as the feds are behind on implementation actions and exchanges are still in a confused infancy.</p>
<p>It is possible the DOL will require the notices to be issued in late summer or fall, ahead of an October (?) startup.</p>
<p>I am now putting the probability of a major delay of exchange start ups at 30%. </p>

<p>If Guns are Cheap, Criminals Will Have Guns</p>
<p>If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.  We&#8217;ve all heard that many times.  But is it true?  Well, it is certainly a tautology. But there is another way to ensure that outlaws have guns.  Namely, keep them cheap.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/pdfs/publications/Firearms_Report_09.pdf">2009 Firearms Used in the Commission of Crimes</a> focusing specifically on guns used in the commission of crimes in rural parts of California:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of the 147 firearms examined, there were 120 (81.6<br />percent) handguns, 13 (8.8 percent) rifles, 11 (7.5 percent) shotguns,<br />and 3 (2 percent) machine guns. </p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/pdfs/publications/Firearms_Report_10.pdf">2010</a> <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/pdfs/publications/Firearms_Report_10.pdf">version of the same report</a> paints a similar picture:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of the 175 firearms reported, there were 158 (90.3 percent) handguns, 12 (6.9 percent) rifles, 4 (2.3 percent) shotguns, and 1 (0.6 percent) full-auto firearm.</p></blockquote>
<p>The reason handguns are more often used in the commission of a crime than other types of weapons is not because the typical criminal doesn&#8217;t think it would be tres cool to use a belt fed machine gun or a shoulder launched missile.  Its because those types of weapons are very, very hard to come by.  With some digging, you can get your hands on a belt fed machine gun, but you are very unlikely to do it for less than $10K for a cheapo model.   Instead, what often happens is that armed criminals are most often armed with what one can best be described as lousy guns.  Don&#8217;t believe me?  <a href="http://www.tonyrogers.com/news/top_10_crime_guns.htm">Here</a> is a post from someone who clearly cannot be described as pro-gun control, commenting on the list of top ten guns used in crimes according to the ATF.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Descriptions include:</p>
<blockquote><p>An absolute piece of crap that sells for less than $120 retail. No real shooter would even warrant this &#8220;gun&#8221; as a legitimate target to even shoot at.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s another:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another piece of shit that sells for less than $110 retail, and is worth less than the pipsqueak ammunition you can try to feed it.</p></blockquote>
<p>And another:</p>
<blockquote><p>The cheapest 12-guage on the market, designed for people who cannot afford a real shotgun. Not even close to being considered a &#8220;fighting&#8221; shotgun. No offense to Mossberg, but there is a reason that  these Wal-Mart grade firepoles are given away at Ducks Unlimited as door prizes. Most do (and should) end up being traded up at gun shops for real shotguns.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of the other descriptions are even more creative.  My favorite is number ten on the list:</p>
<blockquote><p>This one takes the cake as the &#8220;most prone to never fire, ever&#8221; firearm that was ever produced. Apparently they had a street price of $60 in Miami at one point, which would have been better spent on a wristrocket or a billyclub if you planned to actually use one in a legitimate crime. They eventually had to fight lawsuits from prosecutors and criminals at the same time because of their inherent defectiveness.</p></blockquote>
<p>To quote that post further:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though most teenage gangbangers wouldn&#8217;t be caught dead with a Smith and Wesson .38 revolver, an old fashioned six shooter, it nonetheless claims the lead on the top ten list. That&#8217;s because there are literally millions in existence; Smith and Wesson introduced the .38 in 1899, and since then, models have proliferated, transforming the name &#8220;Smith and Wesson .38&#8221; into a generic label for a particular style of gun, even clones that aren&#8217;t made by Smith and Wesson. Similarly, the Smith and Wesson .357 revolver, which was introduced in 1935, and the venerable Mossberg shotgun made the list based on the sheer volume in circulation.</p>
<p>But street criminals are interested almost exclusively in semiautomatics, preferring their superior firepower. (Semiautomatics hold at least seven and often as many as ten or twelve rounds of ammunition. &#8211;Or 18 if you can spend the extra dinero made from a 7-11 heist on a Beretta)</p>
<p>Gun traffickers like to peddle cheap semiautomatics to teenagers because they can tack on a hefty mark-up (of ten bucks) and still offer a weapon that costs less than an upscale gun like a Ruger or Smith and Wesson semiautomatic. That&#8217;s why inexpensive semiautomatics dominate the top ten list. As it happens, many of the companies on that list have links to George Jennings, founder of the now-defunct Raven Arms and his clan. Jennings&#8217; son Bruce founded Bryco in 1992. According to the ATF, Jennings&#8217; son-in-law Jim Davis founded Davis Industries, and Lorcin Engineering was launched by Jim Waldorf, Bruce Jennings&#8217; high school friend. These companies and several others also linked to Jennings are known in the trade as the &#8220;ring of fire.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The point is, criminals use the guns they do because they&#8217;re available, and the guns that are available are usually available because they&#8217;re cheap.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.juancole.com/2013/01/gigawatts-renewables-energy.html">13 gigawatts of New Wind power in US in 2012, Renewables Half of all New Energ</a>y</h4>
<p><i>Michigan voters recently rejected a state constitutional amendment requiring the addition of renewable energy of up to 25% in the future. While the state constitution may have been the wrong place to put it, there does not seem to be much interest in the Republican dominated legislature to tackle renewable energy other than where it is placed.</i>  run754411<br />
<h4>Juan Cole at <i>Informed Comment</i> writes on Wind generated electricity and how it is quickly becoming a major source (updated 1/27&#8230;dan):</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/toddwoody/2013/01/18/u-s-installed-record-13-2-gigawatts-of-wind-energy-in-2012/">The US put in 13 gigawatts of new wind energy capacity in 2012</a>, 5 of it in December alone, according to a Bloomberg study. The <a href="http://www.ferc.gov/legal/staff-reports/dec-2012-energy-infrastructure.pdf">Office of Energy Projects</a> report was a bit more conservative, but confirmed the general trend.<br /><img src="http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chart_21.png?w=450&#038;h=320"><br />h/t <a href="http://grist.org/news/nearly-half-of-new-u-s-power-capacity-in-2012-was-renewable-mostly-wind/">Grist</a><br /><a name="more"></a><br />Wind alone now accounts for 6% of US electricity generation!<br />Even the government figures showed that about <a href="http://grist.org/news/nearly-half-of-new-u-s-power-capacity-in-2012-was-renewable-mostly-wind/">half of all new energy generation</a> in the US came from renewables in 2012, mostly wind turbines.<br />The US also put in about 1.5 gigawatts of new solar power last year.<br /><img src="http://blogs.cas.suffolk.edu/pierpaolo19/files/2012/10/u-s-solar-pv-installations-2010-q2-2012.jpg" height="500" width="570"></p>
<p>In some markets, such as Texas, installing wind turbines for electricity generation is now actually cheaper than building natural gas plants! Reflecting this trend toward wind grid parity, more new wind capacity was added to the US electrical grid than natural gas, which was itself no mean shakes. Gas puts out less carbon dioxide than coal, but fracturing it from underground rock formations may release so much methane (a very potent greenhouse gas) that it is a wash with coal. Both coal and gas plants need to be mothballed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The bad news is that the US still generated 5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2012, the highest per capita in the OECD nations! We are poisoning the world and provoking catastrophic climate change, and all the good news about wind and solar doesn’t offset our massive contribution to looming environmental disaster.</p>
<p>Specially bad news is that 1.4 gigawatts of new, dirty coal power was brought online in 2012 in the US. <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2013/01/plants-mercury-poison.html">That should be illegal! Coal is poisoning us and our world</a>! Carbon dioxide in the quantities we are producing it is a toxin for the world. Not to mention that we are being mercury-poisoned by dirty coal emissions!</p>
<p>If you care about your children, call your state representative (look him or her up) and demand that building new coal plants be made illegal. Now! We don’t need it. Put in wind and solar instead. In many markets it wouldn’t even be more expensive, and if you count in the cost of nerve poisoning by mercury and loss of seaside real estate, wind is dirt cheap compared to coal!</p>
<p>Likewise, call your city council representative and demand that your city generate its own electricity with wind and solar, taking it off the coal grid (this is especially important in the Midwest, where typically 65 percent of electricity generation comes from coal). And if you can afford it, put solar panels on your roof. You can cut your electricity bill 20-40% even in the Midwest. And invest in <a href="http://www.energyboom.com/solar/new-crowdsourcing-platform-gives-hope-small-scale-solar">crowdsourcing solar projects</a> (Warren Buffett is investing in solar, why shouldn’t we?)</p>
<p>We can do this from the bottom up. We can’t wait for the backward Neanderthal tea partiers in our Congress, who practically eat lumps of coal for lunch and wash it down with a petroleum martini. There isn’t much time to bring the carbon down, America. 2020 is a deadline, and it is only 7 years off. Goals of being 20% green by 2020 won’t do it. We need a major national movement and transformation, on the scale of the Civil Rights movement. Because clean energy and a non-warming world are a basic civil and human right that we deserve and will only get it if we demand it.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Last week the <i>Washington Post</i> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/401k-breaches-undermining-retirement-security-for-millions/2013/01/14/f54a0e90-5e70-11e2-8acb-ab5cb77e95c8_story.html">ran a story</a> on the weaknesses of 401(k) retirement accounts, focusing on the the  fact that 1/4 of Americans with 401(k)&#8217;s have used them to meet current  income needs. Among people in their forties, the share rises to 1/3,  an  astounding figure considering how close this group is to retirement. In  the wake of the Great Recession and continuing job market problems, it  is perhaps not surprising that 28% of 401(k) account holders presently  have loans against their accounts.</p>
<p>As the <i>Post</i> delicately puts it,<br />
<blockquote>Many employers have embraced 401(k) and other defined-contribution  accounts as a way of helping workers save for retirement while relieving  themselves of the financial risks that come with managing a traditional  pension plan. In theory, 401(k) accounts are better suited to an  economy in which workers are changing jobs more frequently than ever  because the accounts can be rolled over from previous employers.</p></blockquote>
<p>A  more accurate way of saying this would be that employers have embraced  401(k) plans because they are less expensive than providing pensions,  thereby &#8220;cut(ting) overall employee compensation,&#8221; and that 401(k) plans  don&#8217;t take into account the <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/03/basics-real-wages-remain-below-their.html">stagnation of real wages</a>, points well made by commenter &#8220;Sean2020.&#8221; </p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-fiscal-cliff-and-coming-retirement.html">as I reported before</a>,  49% of private sector worker have neither a 401(k) or a defined benefit  pension plan. Thus, they have no supplement to their eventual Social  Security benefits unless they are able to save outside of a 401(k).</p>
<p>And they aren&#8217;t saving. At least, they&#8217;re aren&#8217;t saving nearly enough to maintain their standard of living after retirement. As <a href="http://www.harkin.senate.gov/documents/pdf/5011b69191eb4.pdf">a report</a> from the Senate&#8217;s Health, Education, Labor, and Pension (HELP) committee states, there is a  $6.6 trillion gap (methodology <a href="http://www.retirement-usa.org/retirement-income-deficit-0">here</a>)  between what people need to maintain their current standard of living  and what they&#8217;ve actually saved for retirement. This is equal to the  combined assets of defined benefit pensions and 401(k) type plans, more  than total state/local/federal government retirement plans, and more  than twice as much as the Social Security Trust Fund. There&#8217;s a reason  I&#8217;ve been using the word &#8220;crisis&#8221;!</p>
<p>Total Assets</p>
<p>Social Security Trust Fund      $2.7 trillion (12/31/2012)<br />Defined benefit pensions         $2.3 trillion (9/30/2012)<br />Defined contribution 401(k)    $4.3 trillion (9/30/2012)<br />State/local gov&#8217;t employee      $3.1 trillion (9/30/2012)<br />Federal employee retirement  $1.5 trillion (9/30/2012)<br />IRA&#8217;s                                    $4.9 trillion (6/30/2011) </p>
<p>Sources: <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/progdata/assets.html">Social Security Administration</a>; <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/z1.pdf">Federal Reserve</a>, tables L-116, L-117, and L-118 (financial assets only), for DB, DC, and government employee programs; <a href="http://www.ici.org/pressroom/news/ret_11_q2">Investment Company Institute</a> for IRAs</p>
<p>This  gigantic hole shows that the current model, based on 401(k)&#8217;s rather  than true pensions, is not working. In a future post I will discuss ways  to fix the crisis.</p>
