                                <p>I don&#8217;t understand what Mohammad El-Erian is saying <a href="http://www.pimco.com/EN/Insights/Pages/Evolution-Impact-and-Limitations-of-Unusual-Central-Bank-Policy-Activism.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>I do entirely sympathise with this</p>
<p>
<blockquote>a professor &#8230;advised me that, in order to maximize the probability of success, I should &#8230; Make sure to cover issues where I know more than those who will be evaluating my work; and, in putting everything together, make sure that I mix and match among components that no one in their right mind would ever combine!<br />I did not listen to this professor’s advice back in 1980, and I have not done so today. Indeed, I have gone the other way! And in so doing, I suspect that I will get very close to – and perhaps even cross, though I hope not – that delicate line that every speaker faces and fears: the one that separates courage from stupidity.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is not a central banker.  I know almost nothing about real world finance.  This post will definitely demonstrate my ignorance, but it might be interesting anyway.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>update: My worse concern is that, while typing, I had the vague sense that Krugman had written something very vaguley similary to what I was typing. I fear I am passing off Krugman&#8217;s arguments (which I don&#8217;t remember) as my own. More than that, I fear I am a victim of Krugmanic possession and that I have lost my ability to think independently of him.</p>
<p>El-Erian&#8217;s main argument is that central banks can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t bear the full burden of stimulating the economy, that is (I assume) there should be fiscal stimulus too.  I absolutely agree with that (although he doesn&#8217;t exactly explain what he means).  But his discussion of disadvantages of central bank interventions is very odd to me.</p>
<p>He seems to define the normal situation and the free market outcome to be the way things were before 2007. But the system was headed for catastrophe then.  It was distorted by the irrational confidence some had in the boundless wealth of investment banks and, for the less naive, by to big to fail moral hazard. 
<div></div>
<p>
<blockquote>There are also genuine concerns that such activism involves a range of collateral damage and unintended consequences, only some of which are visible at this stage. And there will be questioning whether all this continues to be justified by central banks’ impact on the overall economy.<br />Already, there are visible changes to the characteristics and functioning of certain markets. As an example, consider what is happening to the money markets segment.<br />With policy interest rates floored at zero for such an extended period of time (past and also prospectively, according to recent FOMC statements), this segment will continue to shrink – and will do so mostly from the supply side. Funds are being re-intermediated to the banking sector, with quite a portion ending up in excess reserves at the Fed. In the process, borrowers that previously depended on money market investors (think here of commercial paper issuers as an example) are having to find alternative sources of funding. </p></blockquote>
<p>First he seems to be saying that low interest rates are bad for borrowers.  He doesn&#8217;t quite say it, but what else does &#8220;having to find alternative sources of funding&#8221; mean ?  Why don&#8217;t they just pay enough on commercial paper to make money market funds attractive ?  I&#8217;d say it is obvious that they are using alternative sources of funding, because those alternative sources are very attractive, because FOMC policy is very stimulative.</p>
<p>But my more general objection above is based on the fact that El-Erian seems to assume that the capitalisation of money market funds in say 2007 was appropriate, so a change is &#8220;collateral damage.&#8221;  I have a rather different view of money market funds.  I consider them a fraud designed to evade necessary prudential regulation which, by itself, would have destroyed the US economy in the absence of public rescue.  They have been around for decades and worked fine until they collapsed entirely.  I think a reasonable level of their capitalisation would be zero &#8212; they are entirely based on a promise not backed by anything (like deposits before the FDIC) which works fine until there is a panic.  They were saved by a legal only in a crisis rescue.  How can their decline be &#8220;collateral damage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea always was that there are shares which are legally equity but which always happen to be equal one dollar.  Shareholders were not all aware that they owned shares not deposits and that there was no guarantee that a share would be equal to one dollar.  Since the shares are legally equity of a special purpose entity, parent corporations did not have to count them as liabilities when calculating capital ratios.  Nor did they have to hold reserves to redeem the shares.  Also they never paid the FDIC for insurance, but, it turns out they had it for free when they needed it.</p>
<p>The key to the whole approach was that the parent company made a market in the shares (so long as it could with no reason for people to have such faith that it always could given the absence of any prudential requirement for capital, reserves or insurance).  It seems to me that generally if firm A sets up firm B then buys and sells shares of firm B to make them more attractive to other investors we call it market manipulation and call in the SEC.  Sure doesn&#8217;t sound like arms length transactions at market prices to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m old enough to remember the silly regulation which money market funds got around.  Once upon a time there were tight restrictions on nominal interest on deposits (zero for checking accounts IIRC).  I remember when banks offered toaster ovens to people who opened accounts (since they couldn&#8217;t pay a market clearing interest rate).  I never had such an account (I was under 18 at the time).  This was a silly nominal rigidity (which by the way makes any time series econometrics which pools data from the regulation q era and the post regulation q era nonsense).  But it is long gone.</p>
<p>If the purpose of the funds is to convince people they have an asset as safe as a bank deposit without having to bother with capital or reserves, then I think the right policy response is to ban the funds. If the purpose is to get deposit insurance without paying for it, then I think the right policy is to ban the funds.  The people who set them up made a promise which people believed and which they couldn&#8217;t keep in a crisis.  A decline of that sector does not strike me as collateral damage.</p>
<p>Then</p>
<blockquote><p>The functioning of markets is also changing given the size and scope of central bank involvement. The result is artificial pricing, lower liquidity and a more cumbersome price discovery process.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh ? I don&#8217;t even know what this means (at all).  I don&#8217;t see the basis for the conviction that high trading volume (liquidity) is socially desirable.  I think this confuses the interest of expert traders (who benefit from a high volume of fools who are willing to buy what they want to sell and vice versa) with market efficiency. It seems to me that the less cumbersome price discovery process of the recent past was associated with high price volatility and gigantic misspricing of assets largely driven by the irrational trading of expert traders.</p>
<p>Also how does one reconcile these two claims</p>
<blockquote><p>The essence here was captured well in a recent investor remark reported by Bloomberg: “Investors are numb and sedated…. by the money sloshing around the system.”</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>Put differently, a view has evolved that the “trading” segment of markets, whose focus is understandably short-term, is now dominating the “investment” segment.</p></blockquote>
<p>So numb and sedated investors are focusing on the short term as is demonstrated by low liquidity (that is low trading volume).  I just don&#8217;t see how both claims can be true. </p>
<p>Somehow he seems to consider there to be a natural interest rate defined in a way very different than Wicksell defined it and that the current interest rates are lower.  So some interest rate is the free market rate and another one isn&#8217;t.  This sounds vaguely Austrian to me.  It doesn&#8217;t make any particular sense as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>American Enterprise Institute Economists Redux</p>
<p>The other day I wrote a post about economists at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a prominent conservative think-tank.  The post began with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/whats-the-easiest-way-to-cheat-on-your-taxes.html?_r=1&#038;ref=todayspaper&#038;pagewanted=all">this paragraph from a story in the NY Times</a>    <br />
<blockquote>Politicians sometimes say that lower tax rates lead to higher economic growth, which in turn leads to higher overall tax revenue. This may have been true in the early 1960s, when the top tax rate was 91 percent, but the top tax rate today is 35 percent. For decades, lower tax rates have led to lower government revenues, says Alan Viard, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy group. &#8220;The Reagan tax cuts, on the whole, reduced revenue,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;The Bush tax cuts clearly reduced revenue. There is no dispute among economists about that.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>I noted that while Viard is right about tax cuts reducing federal revenue, he is wrong about &#8220;There is no dispute among economists about that.&#8221;  As evidence, I pointed to a piece by his sometime co-author, Kevin Hassett and another by Glenn Hubbard, the first Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors under GW Bush.  Both, I might add, are with the AEI (Hubbard as a visiting scholar).  It wouldn&#8217;t take long to point to other quotes by other AEI economists disputing what Viard said is not disputable (and which, not incidentally, shouldn&#8217;t be disputable given the data.)      At the AEI&#8217;s blog, James Pethokoukis <a href="http://blog.american.com/2012/04/angry-bear-bloggers-and-the-ugly-memory-hole/">responded</a> to my post.  There is no polite way to say this, so I&#8217;ll just state it as it is:  his post is riddled with errors.  Let me cover several of them.   Of my post, Pethokoukis says this:   <br />
<blockquote>I have read it several times but I am not exactly sure of its Big Point other than to say nasty things about economists who either work at AEI or are affiliated with AEI.  What I think author Ken Houghton is trying to say, maybe, is that supply-side economics doesn’t work. </p></blockquote>
<p>There are three errors here, all of them concentrated in the last sentence:   </p>
<p>1.  The author of the piece is not Ken Houghton.  It is Mike Kimel.  As it says, &#8220;Posted by Ken Houghton&#8221; but &#8220;by Mike Kimel.&#8221; </p>
<p>2.  The piece is not trying to say that supply-side economics doesn&#8217;t work.  Alan Viard of the AEI is quoted as saying something which translates as follows:  at least since Reagan took office, the tax cuts we have seen have led to lower revenues.  I don&#8217;t know if Viard is willing to go further and endorse the implication of his statement about taxes and revenues, which is this:   since the top marginal tax rate was at 70% before Reagan took office, and tax cuts from that 70% level and below have led to reduced revenues, if the Laffer curve is more than just a theoretical construct, unless we have a reason to believe that the last thirty two years of US history are an aberration, it turns out that we will not get an increase from revenue from a tax cut unless the top marginal tax rate is somewhere in excess of 70%.  Like I said, that&#8217;s an implication of Viard&#8217;s statement.  </p>
<p>That is not a point of the post, although in the post I did note that it seems Viard had seen data and was being honest about what the data stated.  But that is only a point of the post in the sense that stating &#8220;the New York Times quoted AEI Economist Alan Viard&#8221; is a point of the post, which is to say, it isn&#8217;t a point of the post at all. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />3.  The point of the post is that while one AEI economist is willing to state the obvious about tax cuts, and though he may state that no economist disputes the obvious, his more prominent colleagues at the AEI do dispute what the data so obviously shows.  I went further, and noted that Viard had to know that his own institute is a big part of the problem.     Pethokoukis&#8217; next sentence:</p>
<p> &#8220;Supply-side economics is simply a school of economic thought that believes a) incentives matter, b) high tax rates are bad for growth, and b) inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon.&#8221;   </p>
<p>4.  I&#8217;ll ignore the grammatical error toward the end of the sentence &#8211; there are enough substantive issues in the post &#8211; and merely point out:  &#8220;incentives matter&#8221; is not something that defines supply-side economics any more than having two arms and two legs is a defining property of people of Swedish extraction.  </p>
<p>I have yet to meet an economist of any stripe who doesn&#8217;t believe incentives matter, just as I cannot think of any country whose citizens don&#8217;t typically come equipped with four limbs.  Its just that typically different schools of thought think incentives matter in different ways.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take Marxism as an example.  I&#8217;m no Marxist, nor do I personally know any Marxists, but Marx can be summarized as: &#8220;those with capital have an incentive to exploit the workers to increase their profits, and the workers have an incentive to throw off their shackles, leading to a revolution.  As long as there as a division of people due to ownership, those incentives persist.  Peace, happiness, and prosperity can only exist by getting rid of those incentives, but only a revolution followed by a dictatorship of the proletariat can achieve that.&#8221;  Now, whether Pethokoukis or I agree with this story (for the record, I don&#8217;t, and I&#8217;m pretty sure Pethokoukis doesn&#8217;t either), there is no question that incentives are part of the story.  And I think I can show very clearly that supply siders treat certain incentives as egregiously as the Marxists do, but that&#8217;s for another post.</p>
<p> &#8220;Back in the 1970s, Keynesian economists really didn’t believe any of that stuff and they dominated the economics profession.&#8221;   </p>
<p>4a.  This is kind of a continuation of the previous error, and it indicates Pethokoukis doesn&#8217;t understand the basic point that Keynes was trying to get across.  I would assume that it isn&#8217;t controversy to say that Keynes General Theory, which is the basis for everything one can call &#8220;Keynesianism&#8221; can be summarized as follows:  &#8220;When the economy slows, people buy less stuff, so manufacturers hire fewer people, pushing up unemployment and decreasing wages.  This in turn slows the economy even more, leading to even more even pressure on employment and wages.  But if the government were to start buying stuff, counteracting the reduction in demand from the private sector, it will decrease the pain companies feel, and thus decrease the layoffs and the downward pressure on wages, preventing the economy from getting worse and ending the recession sooner.&#8221;  </p>
<p>If someone can tell that story in a way that doesn&#8217;t require both companies and workers to have incentives, I&#8217;d love to hear it.  Alternatively, if someone can define Keynesian philosophy of any stripe in a way that doesn&#8217;t involve some variation of the story I just told, I&#8217;d love to hear that.    FWIW, here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/economy/GeneralTheoryKeynesIntro.html">Paul Krugman&#8217;s summary of the General Theory</a>:   <br />
<blockquote>Stripped down, the conclusions of The General Theory might be expressed as four bullet points: • Economies can and often do suffer from an overall lack of demand, which leads to involuntary unemployment  • The economy’s automatic tendency to correct shortfalls in demand, if it exists at all, operates slowly and painfully  • Government policies to increase demand, by contrast, can reduce unemployment quickly  • Sometimes increasing the money supply won’t be enough to persuade the private sector to spend more, and government spending must step into the breach</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if you prefer this formulation, its hard to say there aren&#8217;t incentives in the General Theory.     </p>
<p>5.  Most Keynesians do think higher tax rates slow economic growth.  In fact, back to Keyenes&#8230;. the flip side of having the government step in and spend money when the economy is slow is that, according to Keynes, when the economy is running full speed, the government should cut back on spending raise taxes.  One reason for raising taxes is to pay down the debt resulting from the deficit spending when the economy was in recession, but the other is to slow the economy to prevent it from overheating, thus prolonging the expansion.  For what its worth, I personally don&#8217;t think slowing the economy to prevent overheating fits what data we have, but Pethokoukis wasn&#8217; talking about me, he was talking about Keynesian economists in the 1970s.</p>
<p> &#8220;Today, pretty much everybody believes incentives matter, high taxes rates hurt growth and inflation is a monetary phenomenon. &#8221;   </p>
<p>6.  As I noted before, you could find that incentives matter in Marx and you could find it in Keynes&#8217; General Theory, the sources of two schools of thought to which most supply-siders will agree they are in opposition, both of which predate supply-side economics.  So the fact that pretty much everyone believes it today is a meaningless statement unless you can show that  Marx and Keynes were exceptions &#8211; they just happened to believe something that the supply-siders would later believe, but virtually nobody else other than Marx and Keynes held that supply-sider belief prior to the supply-siders.  Otherwise, we&#8217;re once again oohing and aahing over the fact that the overwhelming majority of Swedes have two arms and two legs.     </p>
<p>7. I&#8217;m not sure what Pethokoukis is saying when he says that everyone agrees that inflation is a monetary phenomenon, or that it is a big deal that everyone believes it now, except that he is slightly misquoting Milton Friedman.  That&#8217;s all very nice, but the belief that money affects inflation goes back a very long way.  Lenin, for instance, talked about debauching the currency.  Here&#8217;s Keynes, straight from the General Theory:   <br />
<blockquote>The view that any  increase in the quantity of money is inflationary (unless we mean by inflationary merely that prices are rising) is bound up with the underlying assumption of the classical theory that  we are always in a condition where a reduction in the real rewards of the factors of production will lead to a curtailment in their supply.</p></blockquote>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t sound like someone who doesn&#8217;t believe that the quantity of money is unrelated to inflation.  Its merely someone who believes that the quantity of money alone isn&#8217;t the only determinant of whether there is inflation &#8211; you aren&#8217;t going to have to fear inflation as much if there&#8217;s slack in the system.  To provide an obvious example of what Keynes was talking about almost eighty years ago:  I&#8217;m sure Pethokoukis knows how much the money supply has increased in this country since December 2007 and how little inflation we have had in that time.</p>
<p> &#8220;Supply-side economics is just economics, really. We’re all supply-siders now.&#8221;   </p>
<p>8.  Oh, really?  Well, as I noted above, Keynes agreed with the three beliefs that Pethokoukis ascribes to supply siders (incentives matter, higher tax rates slow growth, and inflation is a monetary phenomenon).  Yes, he had a different view of incentives than Pethokoukis, and he had some caveats on when money doesn&#8217;t affect inflation as much, but for the most part, by Pethokoukis&#8217; definition, Keynes was a supply sider, as are most of the folks he influenced.  (I note that I personally would not qualify as a supply sider by Pethokoukis&#8217; definition, which is to say, I don&#8217;t agree with Keynes on a key piece of that definition but that&#8217;s not the subject of this post.)</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh, and the Laffer Curve? Just common sense.&#8221;   </p>
<p>9.  True.  But common sense is often wrong.  See, the dirty little secret of modern economics as practiced in the US these days is that if you apply the Laffer curve to US data, and by that, I mean, no cherry picking.  Use the entire series of US government data going back to 1929, the first year for which official data exists, estimate revenues = f(top marginal tax rate, top marginal tax rate squared) you get a quadratic function as Laffer said.  The only problem is &#8211; <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/laffer-curve-and-kimel-curve.html">its upside down.</a>  Results are not different from what Laffer claimed, they are absolutely and precisely the opposite.     Don&#8217;t take my word for it.  Do it yourself.  Anyone who took an intermediate level undergraduate econometrics course and has access to a spreadsheet can do it.   &#8220;</p>
<p>Economic historian Bruce Bartlett calls the Laffer Curve “a generally accepted analytical device … [that is] a widely discussed subject in respected academic journals.” &#8221;   </p>
<p>10.  Show me a group of physicists discussing phlogiston and I&#8217;ll show you a group of physicists who should be extremely embarrassed.  As I said above, anyone who took an intermediate level undergraduate econometrics course and has access to a spreadsheet can fit a Laffer curve.   It takes a bit more effort than that to check into whether phlogiston theory has anything to it.</p>
<p> &#8220;In 1980, the top U.S. marginal income tax rate was 70 percent; today it is 35 percent. Yet the share of total income taxes paid by wealthier taxpayers has risen sharply. That is powerful evidence that the United States was on the wrong side of the Laffer Curve back in 1980. &#8221;   </p>
<p>11.  What do the first two sentences have to do with the last sentence?  The Laffer curve is not about the share of taxes paid by the wealthier taxpayers. As Pethokoukis himself wrote a few paragraphs earlier:   <br />
<blockquote>There are two tax rates that generate zero tax revenue, 0 percent and 100 percent. And in between, there is some tax rate which generates a maximum, non-zero amount of tax revenue. As tax rates rise from 0 percent toward that level, tax revenues increase both through higher economic growth and greater tax compliance. Once beyond that inflection point, higher tax rates generate less tax revenue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, powerful evidence against the Laffer curve is, in fact, is provided by Pethokoukis&#8217; colleague Alan Viard of the AEI:   <br />
<blockquote>For decades, lower tax rates have led to lower government revenues, says Alan Viard, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy group. &#8220;The Reagan tax cuts, on the whole, reduced revenue,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;The Bush tax cuts clearly reduced revenue. There is no dispute among economists about that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, for me this is just a hobby &#8211; I don&#8217;t get paid for this.  I&#8217;ve already spent too much time at this and I have to get to work.</p>

                                <p>Guest post by Kenneth Thomas of <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/04/us-has-18th-best-unemployment-benefits.html">Middle Class Political Economist</a></p>
<p>U.S. has 18th best unemployment benefits in OECD; also trails 13 non-OECD countries</p>
<p>  Tim Vlandas at <a href="http://euwelfarestates.blogspot.com/2012/04/world-ranking-in-unemployment-benefit.html">EU Welfare States</a> flags some important recent International Monetary Fund data on the generosity of a number of countries&#8217; unemployment benefits. The metric used is the gross replacement rate (GRR) the ratio of unemployment benefits to a worker&#8217;s previous wages. </p>
<p>The United States gives, on average, a miserly 27.5% of previous wages in unemployment benefits, behind 17 OECD members, though ahead of 11 others (no data was given for OECD members Iceland, Luxembourg, Mexico, Slovak Republic, and Slovenia). Not only that, the U.S. falls behind 13 non-OECD members, including Algeria, Taiwan, and Ukraine, all of which have at least double the replacement rate of the U.S.    </p>
<p>Why is this important? As Vlandas points out,<br />
<blockquote>A high replacement rate&#8230;ensures that the negative effects of rising unemployment on aggregate demand are mitigated. It also prevents workers from falling into poverty when they lose their jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the generosity of unemployment insurance interacts with the state of other employment protections. As regular readers of this blog will recall, <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/labor-day-us-has-weakest-employment.html">the United States has the absolute worst employment protections in the OECD</a>, by a large margin compared to most other members. As commenter Norm Breyfogle rightly noted in response to that post, if your protection from both individual and mass firings are weak, you really need good unemployment insurance. As the data here show, however, U.S. workers are not well-protected with unemployment insurance.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />I won&#8217;t reproduce Vlandas&#8217; <a href="http://euwelfarestates.blogspot.com/2012/04/world-ranking-in-unemployment-benefit.html">entire table</a>, but I will highlight the leaders and some other significant countries.  </p>

<p>To compare it in another way, according to an <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp11154.pdf">IMF working paper</a> (Figure 1, p. 21), the average GRR for high-income countries in 2005 was about 38%, compared to the United States&#8217; 27.5%. U.S. workers get relatively low unemployment benefits compared to other industrialized countries.  <br />Moreover, as I showed in February, the length of unemployment is at its longest since record-keeping started in 1947. The following FRED graph gives both the mean and median length of unemployment, both of which hit double their previous record in the current jobs recession.<br />  <br /><img alt="FRED Graph" height="384" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?&#038;id=LNU03008275,LNU03008276&#038;scale=Left,Left&#038;range=Max,Max&#038;cosd=1948-01-01,1967-07-01&#038;coed=2012-03-01,2012-03-01&#038;line_color=%230000ff,%23ff0000&#038;link_values=false,false&#038;line_style=Solid,Solid&#038;mark_type=NONE,NONE&#038;mw=4,4&#038;lw=1,1&#038;ost=-99999,-99999&#038;oet=99999,99999&#038;mma=0,0&#038;fml=a,a&#038;fq=Monthly,Monthly&#038;fam=avg,avg&#038;fgst=lin,lin&#038;transformation=lin,lin&#038;vintage_date=2012-04-14,2012-04-14&#038;revision_date=2012-04-14,2012-04-14" width="640"><br /><img alt="Loading ..." src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/images/loading.gif"><br />Loading &#8230;<br />Thus, in a country where employment protections are weaker than in any comparable nation, and which is still just below postwar records for length of unemployment, we face the additional problem of low unemployment benefits, a factor which exerts an additional drag on growth.</p>

                                <p>Correlations and Slopes Over Time</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/03/1-spending-as-fraction-of-net-worth-tim.html">Part 1</a>,  we looked at the ratio of consumption spending to net worth, and how it  changed over time.  This time we&#8217;ll look at the correlation between net  worth and consumption.</p>
<p>Here is the big picture: personal consumption expenditures (FRED Series <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/PCE">PCE</a>) plotted against Net Worth (FRED series <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/TNWBSHNO">TNWBSHNO</a>) Data is per calendar quarter.</p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mYa96__tEx0/T4XnYhW8COI/AAAAAAAAByg/SiAR3E1QXiA/s1600/Consumption+vs+Net+Worth.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mYa96__tEx0/T4XnYhW8COI/AAAAAAAAByg/SiAR3E1QXiA/s400/Consumption+vs+Net+Worth.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 1  Consumption vs Net Worth, 1959 &#8211; 2011 </div>
<p>The data set is divided into two segments, with a break point at the  beginning of 1997, with net worth at $30,315 and consumption at $5,467.   In a close up view, there is a clear slope change there.  Still, the  selection is a bit arbitrary, since the high point of Q3, 1994, could  also have been chosen, with net worth at $25291, and PCE at $4856.  But  that is a detail, and no other reasonable breaks stand out.</p>
<p>Notably, both the slope of the data line and R^2 are significantly less  after the break.  Visually, it&#8217;s obvious that in the later data, there  is a lot more scatter.  Also note that that big data moves post 1997  return to the continuation of the best fit line, pre-1997.<br /><a name="more"></a>Slope and R^2 measurements for the entire data set and the two segments are presented in Table 1.  These numbers were generated using the linear trendline function in Excel.</p>

<p>We saw in part 1 of this series that the relationship of consumption to  net worth was not stable, so this result is not surprising.  And we can  now see that as net worth increases, the sensitivity of consumption to  increasing net worth decreases.</p>
<p>I can think of two contributing factors.  As wealth increases, the need  to spend on basic necessities captures a smaller portion of that wealth,  so the propensity to spend decreases.  I&#8217;ll defer consideration of the  other factor for now.</p>
<p>Here is a detailed look at how the slope of the PCE vs net worth line  varied over time.  Graph 2 shows the 34 quarter slope values for the  data points of graph 1.  The slope is plotted in dark blue, with certain  time spans highlighted in contrasting colors: recessions are in orange,  and the stock market and housing bubbles are in yellow.</p>
<div> <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X7S4GxdKU8s/T4YD4mBzJ7I/AAAAAAAAByw/1HD5Hfo5sks/s1600/Consumption+vs+Net+Worth+Slope.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X7S4GxdKU8s/T4YD4mBzJ7I/AAAAAAAAByw/1HD5Hfo5sks/s400/Consumption+vs+Net+Worth+Slope.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 2 Slope of Consumption vs Net Worth </div>
<p>Observations:<br />1) Except for the bubbles and the spike in the post-bubble recession of  2008, the values are mostly contained between a low of 0.168 and a high  0.246.<br />2) There was an upward trend that ended in the mid-70&#8217;s, underscored with a blue line. <br />3) Values after the mid-70&#8217;s, including the two bubbles, are contained in a down-sloping channel, outlined in green.<br />4)  Except for the early 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s events, recessions are marked by sharp, temporary slope increases.<br />5) The average slope is 0.184, with a standard deviation of .038<br />6) The bubbles highlighted in yellow in Graph 2 correspond exactly to  the data points in Graph 1 that fall below the red best fit line. <br />7) The post-bubble recessions brought the slope back into the range  described in Observation 1.  This is illustrated in Graph 1 by the  returns to the blue best fit line.</p>
<p>If the normal relationship between net worth and consumption is  described by a slope in the range of around 0.17 to 0.25, what is there  about bubbles that causes drops into the range of 0.11 to 0.12 at the  peaks?  I think the answer is the second factor that I defered until  now.  The stock bubble and the housing bubble represented wealth  increases that were not shared equally across the population.   Specifically, as <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/02/income-and-consumption.html#more">I pointed out earlier</a>,  these assets are mostly owned by the richest population segment, and  growth in wealth has excessively favored the top 1% of the population.    They have the least propensity to spend, and this tendency drives the  PCE slope into the low range.</p>
<p>This FRED graph illustrates the point in a different way.</p>
<div> <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=6pu"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=6pu" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 3 PCE, Net Worth and Disposable Income</div>
<p>There are four lines, Net Worth in green (divided by 5 to put it on the  same scale); Disposable Income in purple, PCE in red, and Disposible  Income multiplied by 0.931 in blue.  Note that the last two overlap  almost perfectly, as I also pointed out earlier (see link above.)</p>
<p>The conclusions I&#8217;m drawing are<br />1) Since the bubbles increased wealth in a highly skewed fashion, the  relationship between average wealth and consumption broke down.<br />2) When the bubbles burst, the normal relationship between wealth and consumption reasserted itself.<br />3) The underlying cause is that during the bubbles the relationship  between wealth and income broke down, and afterwards reasserted itself. <br />4) The relationship between disposable income and consumption is robust across time and most extraordinary financial events.<br />5) All the foregoing suggest that if wealth distribution were more even  across the population (and thus more closely tied to disposable income,)  then the relationship between wealth and consumption would be more  robust.</p>

                                <p>The monthly trade data was reported this morning and you will see press reports about the nominal trade deficit.  But I like to look at the real trade data as it gives a better feel for the economic impact of trade.  The real trade deficit is improving and the balance in February was $44,148 million ( 2005 $) as compared to $48,294 million ( 2005 $) in December. I am<br />comparing the February to December because in the real GDP accounts they compare the change over the quarter versus the quarterly average for most of the economic series in the accounts.<br />This looks like a nice gain and implies that trade will make a nice contribution to first quarter growth.</p>

We are really seeing a structural change in the US energy environment because of falling domestic demand and expanded output from fracking.  For the first time since oil became a major issue in the 1970&#8217;s we are starting to see a real possibility that over the next decade  the US could really achieve energy self sufficiency.  Drill, Baby, Drill is no longer just some silly political<br />campaign slogan.  The US probably will not actually achieve energy independence, but we should reach the point where we only import energy from other North American sources.  The US can<br />eliminate its direct dependence on Mideast oil. It is already starting to happen and on a net basis US real oil imports have been cut  almost in half from their 2005 peak.</p>

Part of this is due to the current transportation bottlenecks that have created a surplus of oil in the interior and lead to West Texas Intermediate oil trading about $20/bbl cheaper than Brent crude.<br /><a name="more"></a>This is giving the Gulf Coast refiners a major competitive edge in world markets for refined oil products.  But is also becoming a major political issue over the Keystone XL Pipeline. The pipeline would allow Canadian Tar Sands oil to flow to the Gulf Coast refiners.  Of course, oil is fungible and if Canada exports their oil from their own ports it would have the same impact on world oil supply and demand and oil prices would be about the same  as if the Keystone pipeline is built. The pipeline would benefit the US, but most of the political claims are grossly exgerated.</p>

But much of the surge is just the snap back<br />from the plunge in trade during the Great Recession. Real exports growth of non-petroleum products is slowing rapidly as the year over year growth rate has slowed to about 5% as compared to a peak rate of almost 20%. in 2010.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kvg2KwOxpBo/T4cA3M4AECI/AAAAAAAACDc/aC1OCqIbr7Q/s1600/Clipboard02%2BEXP%2BXOIL.bmp"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kvg2KwOxpBo/T4cA3M4AECI/AAAAAAAACDc/aC1OCqIbr7Q/s320/Clipboard02%2BEXP%2BXOIL.bmp"></a></p>
<p>Real non-petroleum imports are showing a similar trend where growth has slowed to about 5%<br />as compared to a peak growth rate of 30% in 2010.    Of course, imports are larger than exports so if they both grow at the same rate the trade deficit would widen.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I do&#8217;t want to be rude to anyone in particular, so I will just note that I have the impression that two people who should know better are willing to suggest that logically consistent models populated by rational optimizing agents have policy invariant implications, that is are not vulnerable to the Lucas critique.</p>
<p>This is obviously false. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a> </p>
<p>I will concede two points.  First the the objectives of the agents in the model are the same as the objectives of all agents in the real world and the constraints are the same as real world constraints, then the implications will be optimal predictions no matter what policy is implemented.  That is the models would work fine if they weren&#8217;t models but were rather the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  No one claims this, so this concession amounts to nothing at all.</p>
<p>Second, models can be useful approximatiions to reality.  A model is a useful approximation to reality if it yields approximately accurate predictions and conditional predictions.  This is to say that models which are not vulnerable to the Lucas critique are not vulnerable to the Lucas critique.  Noting this tautology, I have conceded nothing at all.</p>
<p>Beyond these two non concessions I will not go.  Internally consistent models with optimizing agents are not in general presumptively useful for policy analysis.  If one has two models neither of which fit the facts one of which is an ad hoc reduced form model and one of which is a consistent model with optimizing agents, there is no reason to use the internally consistent model for policy analysis.  If you have two models both of which fit the facts one of which is an ad hoc reduced form model and one of which is a consistent model with optimizing agents, there is no reason to use the internally consistent model for policy analysis.  Fitting the facts is no more reliable a guide to usefulness in policy analysis for an internally consistent model with optimizing agents.</p>
<p>The reason is that a fundamentally invalid model (meaning one which is not a useful tool for policy analysis) can fit the data well for one policy regime and poorly for another.  This is just as true of a model with optimizing agents but fundamentally false assumptions about objectives and constraints as it is for an ad hoc reduced form model.  I will attempt to argue that it is just exactly precisely as true and not one iota less true, but I am not sure I can measure truth down to one iota.  </p>
<p>Some examples.  It is not clear from the data whether people don&#8217;t want to do something or if they are prevented from doing it.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say it is 1990.  I could write down a model in which people of different types choose to marry if and only if this increases each spouses utility.  Looking at the data, I note that same gender couples don&#8217;t appear in marriage registers.  I conclude that gay people are not the marrying kind.  I predict this will remain true no matter how policy changes.  I am a total fool.  But the model had optimizing agents and was internally consistent.  </p>
<p>I can write down a model in which the labor market clears.  I can estimate labor supply parameters using micro data.  I note that men&#8217;s labor supply is extremely inelastic compared to women&#8217;s.  Based on this perfectly fine micro model with optimizing agents, I predict that employment of men will fluctuate much less from 1987 on then employment of women.  I am a fool.  The assumption that the labor market clears can be consistent with my micro data (I can assume the self declared unemployed are lazy and lying).  But I can&#8217;t explain the recent fluctuations.</p>
<p>If I had used US macro data from 1984 through 2007 to check my model, it would have looked OK.  </p>
<p>OK enough joking around.  Let&#8217;s consider a famous case of a bad model: the old expectations unaugmented Phillips curve.  This is, as noted by Krugman among others, the one and only example used for decades to justify the quest for consistent micro founded macroeconomics.  Here the current view is roughly that the true relationship between unemployment and inflation is that unemployment is related to inflation minus the best forecast of inflation conditional on information.  In the original now long abandoned Lucas model the information was all information available at the time unemployment and inflation are measured.  In New Keynesian models the relevant conditioning information must be older &#8212; in fact typically the statement is only approximately true and a better and better approximation the older the conditioning information).  The view from 1959 through 1974 (that is the whole Keynesian era) was that there is a stable relationship between inflation and unemployment.  The interpretation is that expected inflation was roughly constant in the times and places analysed by old Keynesians and it was implicitly assumed that something which happens to be roughly constant is constant.  This lead to terrible predictions in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Then the profession shifted to belief in a natural rate of unemployment.  The expected value of unemployment conditional on long ago information is constant (this is implied by the expectations augmented Phillips curve described above &#8212; otherwise it has no content).  There was a huge debate over whether the long term was a month (as required by Lucas) roughly a year or so (as interpreted by Barro who made Sargent lose his cool that way) or a few years.  </p>
<p>Guided by this insight, European policy makers decided that it would be a good idea to fight inflation at the cost of a few years of high unemployment.  Unemployment remained very high for a decade and a half.  It was decided that there was something wrong with European economies (basically trade unions and labor regulations) and that, if they were what economies are supposed to be, the models would have worked.  When the model didn&#8217;t fit reality, the conclusion was that the scientific thing to do was to reject reality.  </p>
<p>But note this means that the first confrontation with reality should have demolished the natural rate hypothesis.  The idea that the long term conditional average of unemployment is constant is similar to the idea that the long ago subjectively forecast rate of inflation is constant.  It might be true in general (&#8220;might&#8221; makes right) but it might also be that it just happened that policy had been such that it was true over the time period studied.  Anchored inflation expectations might exist only if policy makers do not tolerate persistent inflation.  A constant medium term average unemployment rate might exist only if policy makers do not tolerate long lasting fluctuations in unemployment.  The story about subjectively expected inflation was more appealing, because no one had good models of unemployment (while the rational expectations hypothesis is elegant and simple).  But the data were equally cruel to each assumption.</p>
<p>The result is that macroeconomics is based on models in which there isn&#8217;t a stable Phillips curve and there is a natural rate of unemployment.  Evidently some data are more equal than others.  </p>
<p>The really shocking thing is that the same economist (0.J. Blanchard) can switch from a model explaining why there is not a natural rate of unemployment to an estimation strategy which uses the assumption of a natural rate of unemployment for identification within two years without blushing.  The rules of what may and may not be assumed are respected, but they have nothing to do with evidence.</p>
<p>Back to history.</p>
<p>In any case, it was argued that reflation would cause intolerably high inflation (that means inflation) so there was nothing to be done but reform labor markets.  Then the stock market crashed in 1987.  This caused Margaret Thatcher to panic and force the Bank of England (not then independent) to reflate.  For a couple of years, the UK unemployed were criticized more harshly than ever, because there were many vacant jobs and unemployment didn&#8217;t fall quickly (evidently top economists were not familiar with the subtle concepts of a &#8220;stock&#8221; and a &#8220;flow&#8221; or of the relative plausibility of a stable Beveridge curve and a stable matching function  &#8212; well I&#8217;ve had to explain that to them again recently so I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised).</p>
<p>The the UK unemployment rate fell sharply.  There was a temporary increase in inflation.  The unemployment rate remained far below the Continental average.  The inflation rate converged back to very low.  The view that fluctuations in inflation are permanent and fluctuations in unemployment temporary was not damaged at all by the episode.  Instead the UK became one of the good Anglophone economies instead of being (as it had been) a key example of Eurosclerosis.    </p>
<p>Notably which countries are good and which are bad changes every decade, but the free market system can never fail, it can only be failed.  Following shocks a country can switch from being key examples of free markets working to key examples of government intervention failing and back within a few years.  That country is called South Korea (while on the peninsula I note that North Korea shows that some forms of government intervention are catastrophic).</p>
