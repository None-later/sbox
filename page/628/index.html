                                <p>Here&#8217;s Vtcodger:<br />
<blockquote>Detroit&#8217;s problems are self inflicted and entirely predictable &#8230; although not by the guys they are paying millions of dollars a year to do the predicting.</p>
<p>Whocudanode? Anyone with half a brain.</p>
<p>The basic problem is that between 1950 when they probably did build the best cars in the world (with the possible exception of VW&#8217;s beetle) and 1975, they did nothing much to improve the reliability, safety, or handling of their cars. They just raked in the cash and headed to the country club for a round of golf and a few drinks.</p>
<p>Then they woke up one morning and there was a gas shortage. Worse, the Japanese were selling cars that cost less, lasted longer, didn&#8217;t break as often, got better gas mileage and &#8212; important to those of us who do not live in Detroit &#8212; could negotiate curves and hills in relative safety.</p>
<p>Detroit&#8217;s response was to limit Japanese car imports, lie a lot, and eventually to spend a gazillion dollars in advertising convincing Americans that they wanted and needed huge, expensive, and not especially useful vehicles. In fact Americans (mostly) didn&#8217;t need those vehicles. At least not as far as I can see. But Detroit needed to sell them.</p>
<p>So now, here we are again. Another gas crisis, and Detroit still can&#8217;t build inexpensive, reliable, fuel efficient cars profitably. If you ask me, that is no one&#8217;s fault but Detroit&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The problem. Bad management. Lots and lots of bad management. Solution: GM should I think, consider simply folding up its tent and liquidating the company. I don&#8217;t think Chrysler matters. Ford &#8212; Might be salvageable. But it&#8217;s going to take years, and they are going to be rough years.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think Ford and GM are more similarly situated, and contrast with Daimler-less Chrysler, at least in that both manage to sell fuel-efficient cars in large quantities and sometimes even at a profit into the European market.  Both also seem to have been hit with large clue-sticks, as other recent car news has indicated some willingness to actually try to sell decent <a href="http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080602/FREE/516060181/1530/FREE">compacts</a> and <a href="http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080530/FREE/356550315/1023/CARNEWS">subcompacts</a> in the U.S. on the part of both firms.  Arguably they&#8217;ve stopped digging their graves, but &#8216;Codger is right that getting out is another matter.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.truthout.org/article/is-water-becoming-new-oil">The world&#8217;s remaining accessible fresh-water supplies</a> are divided among industry (20 percent), agriculture (70 percent), and domestic use (10 percent), according to the United Nations. </p>
<p>    Meanwhile, fresh-water consumption worldwide has more than doubled since World War II to nearly 4,000 cubic kilometers annually and set to rise another 25 percent by 2030, says a 2007 report by the Zurich-based Sustainable Asset Management (SAM) group investment firm. </p>
<p><em>Up to triple that is available for human use, so there should be plenty, the report says. But waste, climate change, and pollution have left clean water supplies running short. </em><br />    &#8220;We have ignored demand for decades, just assuming supplies of water would be there,&#8221; Dr. Gleick says. &#8220;Now we have to learn to manage water demand and &#8211; on top of that &#8211; deal with climate change, too.&#8221; </p>
<p>    Population and economic growth across Asia and the rest of the developing world is a major factor driving fresh-water scarcity. The earth&#8217;s human population is predicted to rise from 6 billion to about 9 billion by 2050, the UN reports. Feeding them will mean more irrigation for crops. </p>
<p>    Increasing attention is also being paid to the global &#8220;virtual water&#8221; trade. It appears in food or other products that require water to produce, products that are then exported to another nation. The US may consume even more water &#8211; virtual water &#8211; by importing goods that require lots of water to make. At the same time, the US exports virtual water through goods it sells abroad.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>At one point in the speech McCain said, &#8220;Sen. Obama supports the tariffs that have led to rising grocery bills for American families.&#8221; This is wrong on two points. First, Obama doesn&#8217;t support any such tariffs that I know of, although I imagine someone in the McCain campaign would try to argue (falsely) that Obama&#8217;s criticism of particular aspects of trade agreements means that he supports food tariffs.  More importantly, no one thinks tariffs are behind the increase in food prices. As Obama noted in an interview a few weeks ago, there are many factors behind the rise in food prices. These include rising oil prices (which affect fertilizer and tranports costs), poor harvests this year in a few countries, rising demand in Asia, and the rising demand for biofuels, which has been driven by subsidies in the U.S. and elsewhere. I&#8217;ve read many studies on this topic in recent months, and no one has suggested that food prices in the U.S. have increased because of U.S. tariffs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don makes two important points about how McCain has been running his campaign: (1) McCain has often flat out lied in his pathetic attempts to attack Obama; and (2) McCain generally has no clue as to what is going on with respect to important policy issues.</p>

<blockquote><p>DAVID BROOKS, “NEW YORK TIMES”:  Obama‘s problem is he doesn‘t seem like a guy who can go into an Applebee‘s salad bar and people think he fits in naturally there.  He has to change to be more like that Applebee‘s guy and as he‘s done that he‘s become much more transactional.  Much more, I‘m going to deliver this and this and this to you on policy.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/06/03/memo-to-david-brooks-applebees-doesnt-have-a-salad-bar">John Amato</a> realizes that David Brooks was just being an idiot:</p>
<blockquote><p>I called an Applebee’s also and they told me that none of their restaurants have a salad bar. David, sometimes the jokes write themselves. What an idiot.</p></blockquote>
<p>But then he had help from <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/06/03/brooks/#comment-701632">Mitzi</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I called my Applebee’s today to make sure I was correct and they do not have a salad bar. Just goes to show how much these people who make these comments have no idea how “regular people” live their lives.</p></blockquote>
<p>Something tells me that David Brooks would not fit naturally in an Applebee’s either.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In cross-price elasticity of demand news, a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080603/ap_on_bi_ge/auto_sales">story on the AP wire</a> notes that, for the first time in ages, Toyota&#8217;s Camry and Corolla cars both outsold Ford&#8217;s full-size F-150 pickup truck. [*]</p>
<p>It&#8217;s arguably worse even than that for Ford&#8217;s truck business, since neither the Corolla (<a href="http://www.toyota.com/about/news/corporate/2008/06/03-1-sales.html">52,826 units sold</a>) nor the Camry (51,291) was the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. last month; that award goes to the Honda Civic (<a href="http://www.hondanews.com/categories/1097/releases/4528">53,299</a>).  As Honda also sold 43,728 Accords, that bumps the mighty pickup into 5th and 6th place for Ford and Chevy respectively.</p>
<p>In fact, poring over the gruesome sales numbers from the Domestic Three, it looks like $4 gasoline is enough to undermine the market for larger &#8216;crossover&#8217; SUVs, without which measured truck sales would be even worse.  (Crossovers are trucks partly for regulatory reasons and partly for marketing reasons; the features that let them pass for regulatory trucks put them at a considerable fuel-economy disadvantage compared to the few proper wagons that the auto industry deigns to sell in the U.S.) No surprise, then, that there&#8217;s quite a bit of belated scrambling to &#8220;<a href="http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewmonthlyreleasedetail.do?domain=74&#038;docid=46161">build on car momentum</a>&#8221; in industry-speak.</p>
<p>And as many of you have seen, that&#8217;s hitting <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080603/ap_on_bi_ge/gm_factories">the Domestic Three&#8217;s manufacturing employment</a>:<br />
<blockquote>General Motors is closing four truck and SUV plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico as surging fuel prices is hastening a dramatic shift to smaller vehicles.</p>
<p>CEO Rick Wagoner said Tuesday before the automaker&#8217;s annual meeting the plants to be closed are in Oshawa, Ontario; Moraine, Ohio; Janesville, Wis.; and Toluca, Mexico. He also said the Hummer brand may be discontinued.</p></blockquote>
<p>Janesville is not far from Madison, and it was considered something of a coup at the time when Janesville retained its lines for GM&#8217;s large pickups and SUVs.  However, the truck market had already peaked by the time the current models had reached production a couple years ago.  Unfortunately for the 2000-odd GM employees (and a number of local employees of GM suppliers), GM&#8217;s product planners don&#8217;t have anything more marketable for them to build there.</p>
<p>[*] The story was edited to reflect later-arriving sales figures.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Well this is even less of an economics post than XV and in thinking on this the last couple days I realized I didn&#8217;t have a firm enough grip on the historical particulars to make it as definitive as I wanted. But still the concept is important and I could use some feedback so here goes.</p>
<p>When we talk about a Reactionary today we generally mean nothing more than &#8216;very Conservative&#8217;. But the term has a specific historical reference, it describes those who lined up behind the forces of Reaction in the years on either side of the nineteenth century. This Reaction was to specific events, notably the American and French Revolutions which were perceived, and rightly, as being systemic risks to the political, economic, and religious structure of society as it existed, not just to crowned monarchs (though Louis XVI showed that had to be taken into consideration), but to the aristocracy, the merchant and industrial class, and to the landowners. The key point to understand is that for the original Reactionaries &#8216;Democracy&#8217; was quite literally a dirty word, it was considered and called &#8216;Mob Rule&#8217;. Then further consider that the forces of Reaction did not at all believe that &#8216;All Men are Created Equal&#8217; and rejected all three parts of the French slogan &#8216;Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite&#8217;, at least as they pertained to the working class in relation to them. These Revolutions unleashed forces that put the whole concept of Privilege and Birth at risk, because once you start leveling things who knows where the stopping point is.</p>
<p>Which leads to the second point. In  nineteenth century  it was nearly impossible to draw any kind of clear lines between the drives for universal franchise, for the right to organize and bargain collectively, and for socialism. Indeed when the British Labour Party came into being at the end of the century it was organized specifically on all three lines.</p>
<p>Which leads to two questions. One was the classical economics stemming from Adam Smith shaped by the fact that its practitioners by and large lived in a society where exclusive privilege was a societal norm and where democracy was seen as an existential threat to that society? Two can the continued hostility to Social Security be explained as a simple continuation of a politics and an economics formed within a framework of Reaction?</p>
<p>Personally I think the answer to both questions is &#8216;Yes&#8217;. Orthodox economists tend to look at the world through the lens of a discipline formed in days when democracy and hence pragmatic greatest good solutions could not be distinguished from socialism and class warfare. If we accept this frame much of the mystery behind the denials of income inequality, resistance to minimum wage, denial that wages are set by power relations to begin with, and yes opposition to Social Security all can be explained as stemming from the same source, that of Reaction pushing back on perceived Socialism.</p>

                                <p>Lifted from comments cactus style by Reader Stuart Levine continued from the post on Mankiw and corporate taxes <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/corporate-tax-rate.html">here</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/would-mccains-proposed-reduction-in.html">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mankiw relies on &#8220;[A] 2006 study [by] the economist William C. Randolph of the Congressional Budget Office [who] estimated who wins and who loses from this tax. He concluded that &#8216;domestic labor bears slightly more than 70 percent of the burden.'&#8221; </p>
<p>Mankiw somehow avoids posting the URL of the Randolph study <a href="http://snipurl.com/2c4nt">(it&#8217;s here)</a>. Perhaps Mankiw was concerned that someone might also read the portion of the same study that concluded: &#8220;Replacement [of the corporate income tax] by a tax on the worldwide capital income of domestic residents&#8211;a tax that achieves capital export neutrality&#8211;shifts the entire amount of domestic labor&#8217;s burden toward the domestic owners of capital. That shift increases the domestic resident capital owners&#8217;share of the burden by about 68 percent of the tax revenue. Worldwide, both labor and capital owners benefit slightly from an increased investment efficiency under that replacement tax, but the largest changes are in the redistribution of tax burdens toward the domestic owners of capital away from domestic labor, and away from foreign owners of capital toward foreign labor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, this would undermine the attractiveness of Mankiw&#8217;s preference, a regressive excise tax such as a tax on gasoline.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Newly diagnosed cases of post-traumatic stress disorder among U.S. troops sent to Iraq and Afghanistan surged 46.4 percent in 2007, bringing the five-year total to nearly 40,000, according to U.S. military data released on Tuesday.<br />    The statistics, released by the Army, showed the number of new PTSD cases formally diagnosed at U.S. military facilities climbed to 13,981 last year from 9,549 in 2006.</p>
<p>    The numbers rose as President George W. Bush poured extra forces into Iraq to try to quell sectarian violence and extended Army tours from 12 to 15 months. The United States has also sent more forces to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>    The figures, encompassing all four branches of the U.S. armed services, showed that the Army alone had 10,049 new PTSD cases last year.</p>
<p>    This brings to 39,366 the number of PTSD cases diagnosed at military facilities between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2007, among troops deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>
<p>    The totals include 28,365 cases for the Army, 5,641 for the Marines, 2,884 for the Navy and 2,476 for the Air Force.</p>
<p>    Army officials said the larger number of PTSD diagnoses in recent years partly reflects greater awareness and tracking of the disorder by the U.S. military.</p>
<p>    Longer, Multiple Combat Tours</p>
<p>    &#8220;But we&#8217;re also exposing more people to combat,&#8221; Lt. Gen. Eric Schoomaker, the Army surgeon general, told reporters.</p>
<p>    Experts also say PTSD symptoms increase as soldiers return to combat for multiple tours of duty.</p></blockquote>

<p>Update 2: What makes PTSD worth considering?  Aren&#8217;t anxiety and irritability common to everyone at some point?  Do we see more because we want to?  Are there external costs we do not want to think about&#8230;and for whom?</p>
<p>More article and comments below the fold.</p>

<blockquote>PTSD is a health condition that can result from wartime trauma such as being physically wounded or seeing others hurt or killed.</p>
<p>    Symptoms range from irritability and outbursts of anger to sleep difficulties, trouble concentrating, extreme vigilance and an exaggerated startle response. People with the condition can persistently relive the traumatic events that initially induced horror or helplessness.</p>
<p>    The Pentagon has come under mounting political pressure in recent years to enhance treatment for PTSD amid criticism that initial programs were inadequate.</p>
<p>    Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced a change in the U.S. government clearance process that allows PTSD sufferers to seek help for combat-related mental health problems without risking their military careers.</p>
<p>    Army officials on Tuesday emphasized that the data do not reflect the actual number of troops and war veterans who suffer from PTSD, many of whom do not seek treatment or have been diagnosed at civilian facilities where records are confidential.</p>
<p>    A recent study by the RAND Corp. estimated about 300,000 troops, or 18.5 percent, of the more than 1.5 million troops sent to Iraq and Afghanistan exhibit symptoms of either PTSD or depression.</p>
<p>    The fresh statistics add detail about the scale of human suffering from two wars that have killed 4,579 U.S. troops and inflicted physical wounds on 32,076 more.</p>
<p>    There currently are 155,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and 33,000 in Afghanistan.</p></blockquote>
<p>Readers know I have a special interest in PTSD.  The <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5048766&#038;postID=8398418583781295074">last post</a> concerned the use of a diagnostic category inappropriate to PTSD in my opinion.</p>

<p>Title:  Carbon cap and trade, good idea?  Bad Idea?</p>
<p>Here is the &#8220;con&#8221; case from George Will via <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/30/AR2008053002521.html">The Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An unprecedentedly radical government grab for control of the American economy will be debated this week when the Senate considers saving the planet by means of a cap-and-trade system to ration carbon emissions. The plan is co-authored (with John Warner) by Joe Lieberman, an ardent supporter of John McCain, who supports Lieberman&#8217;s legislation and recently spoke about &#8220;the central facts of rising temperatures, rising waters and all the endless troubles that global warming will bring.&#8221; <br />Speaking of endless troubles, &#8220;cap-and-trade&#8221; comes cloaked in reassuring rhetoric about the government merely creating a market, but government actually would create a scarcity so that government could sell what it had made scarce. The Wall Street Journal underestimates cap-and-trade&#8217;s perniciousness when it says the scheme would create a new right (&#8220;allowances&#8221;) to produce carbon dioxide and would put a price on the right. Actually, because freedom is the silence of the law, that right has always existed in the absence of prohibitions. With cap-and-trade, government would create a right for itself&#8211; an extraordinarily lucrative right to ration Americans&#8217; exercise of their traditional rights. <br />Lieberman guesses that the market value of all permits would be &#8220;about $7 trillion by 2050.&#8221; Will that staggering sum pay for a $7 trillion reduction of other taxes? Not exactly. <br />It would go to a Climate Change Credit Corporation, which Lieberman calls &#8220;a private-public entity&#8221; that, operating outside the budget process, would invest &#8220;in many things.&#8221; This would be industrial policy, a.k.a. socialism, on a grand scale &#8212; government picking winners and losers, all of whom will have powerful incentives to invest in lobbyists to influence government&#8217;s thousands of new wealth-allocating decisions. <br />Lieberman&#8217;s legislation also would create a Carbon Market Efficiency Board empowered to &#8220;provide allowances and alter demands&#8221; in response to &#8220;an impact that is much more onerous&#8221; than expected. And Lieberman says that if a foreign company selling a product in America &#8220;enjoys a price advantage over an American competitor&#8221; because the American firm has had to comply with the cap-and-trade regime, &#8220;we will impose a fee&#8221; on the foreign company &#8220;to equalize the price.&#8221; Protectionism-masquerading-as-environmentalism will thicken the unsavory entanglement of commercial life and political life.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Regarding McCain&#8217;s &#8220;central facts,&#8221; the U.N.&#8217;s World Meteorological Organization, which helped establish the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change &#8212; co-winner, with Al Gore, of the Nobel Peace Prize &#8212; says global temperatures have not risen in a decade. So Congress might be arriving late at the save-the-planet party. Better late than never? No. When government, ever eager to expand its grip on the governed and their wealth, manufactures hysteria as an excuse for doing so, then: better never.</p></blockquote>

<p>Update:  <a href="http://www.wmo.int/pages/mediacentre/press_releases/pr_805_en.html">World Meteoroligical Organization</a> link says things are getting dicey.  Can you find the no rise in temperature implication?  Is this another instance of misinterpretation of a document? (h/t Robert M)</p>

<blockquote>Economics is not a science. Physics wouldn&#8217;t be a science either if esteemed members of that profession who got prestigious jobs running the country were willing to make statements that contradict all known facts. But here&#8217;s the thing &#8211; if the administration&#8217;s position is that you can use gravel as fuel in a nuclear power plant (a convenient position give that gravel is so much cheaper than uranium), they&#8217;re going to have a hard time finding eminent physicists willing to agree with that position, and any physicists that did agree would quickly cease to be eminent physicists. </p>
<p>But consider an equivalent economic position. In 2001 told us we were going to get tax cuts, resulting in a rapidly growing economy leading to debt falling to 7% of GDP in 2011. This is extremely similar to the promising you will get electricity from a pile of gravel. But, there was no shortage of well-known economists willing to explain why that plan was, indeed, going to work. And they explained it over and over. Since then, they have gone to explain to us why things haven&#8217;t worked out as planned&#8230; and wouldn&#8217;t you know it, it has nothing to do with the fact that they used gravel to try to run a nuclear power plant. Instead, the problem seems to be that some terrorists slammed some planes into the WTC. </p>
<p>Which brings us to, well us. See, its our fault that economics is not a science. The folks who peddled this line of bs to us, the folks who promised that gravel was going to produce electricity and have since been making all sorts of excuses and promises that it really will work the next time its tried, are still around, and still held in high esteem. The Harvard Professor, the governor, the ivy league business school dean, and the rest of that crowd don&#8217;t feel a need to hide their faces in shame the way their counterparts in physics would. </p>
<p>No, they&#8217;ve been well rewarded for their actions, and still continue to be honored by others in the profession they so badly denigrated. So the lesson is clear &#8211; this is the most lucrative way to behave. By sending this message, we have dishonored ourselves, and we have paved the way for the next Harvard professor, the next governor, and the next business school dean.</p></blockquote>
