                                <p>Greg Mankiw, clearly distracted by <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/05/economic-princi.html">his former collaborator&#8217;s wife having been denied a tenured position at Harvard</a>, quotes <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/05/pelosi-problem.html">Fred Bergsten in the WSJ</a>, Instapundit-style:<br />
<blockquote>By effectively killing &#8220;fast track&#8221; procedures that guarantee a yes-or-no vote on trade agreements within 90 days, lawmakers in Washington, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have destroyed the credibility of the U.S. as a reliable negotiating partner.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which leads to the obvious conclusion: Republicans &#8220;destroyed the credibility of the U.S. in 1998 when they did the same thing to President Clinton.</p>
<p>Strangely, <a href="http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mankiw/files/jan98.html">Greg Mankiw (Fortune, January 12, 1998)</a> &#8220;knew better.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>Policy and politics diverged again in the fast-track debate. Clinton was asking Congress for something all recent Presidents have had&#8211;the authority to negotiate trade deals that Congress would consider without amendment. This power is crucial if the President is to continue the multilateral process that over the past half-century has moved the world toward freer trade and greater prosperity.</p>
<p>Although economists are united in support of free trade, opinion polls show the American public is more skeptical. The public&#8217;s view is partly based on the false analogy that trade is like war&#8211;some countries must lose for others to win&#8230;.</p>
<p>Because of the public&#8217;s ambivalence&#8211;and the opposition of interest groups that fear foreign competition&#8211;fast track went down to defeat. This may put an end to the multilateral approach to opening up world trade. But it need not mean an end to the free-trade movement.*</p></blockquote>
<p>Got it?  If it&#8217;s a Democratic Congress, then Pelosi is a &#8220;problem.&#8221;  If it&#8217;s a Republican Congress doing the same thing, it&#8217;s Through No Fault of Their Own.</p>
<p>And by not pointing out that he himself used to know better, Greg Mankiw destroys not Fred Bergsten&#8217;s credibility, but his own.</p>

<p>*Yes, I omitted Mankiw&#8217;s framing issue (tomatoes), but if he really wants to claim George W. &#8220;Steel Tariffs&#8221; Bush was different, the only possible response is &#8220;Bring it on.&#8221;</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Micheline Maynard&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/21/business/21air.html">story today on airline route cutbacks</a> leads with small cities losing air service entirely, but arguably the more important information is in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/05/21/business/21air.graphix.ready.html">accompanying table</a>.  The combined flight cutbacks at the 10 largest airports losing service (~1,500 monthly flights) add up to just about half the reduction in flights at Chicago O&#8217;Hare alone between January &#8217;07 and January &#8217;08.</p>
<p>Now, blowing $61 million on an enlarged runway at Hagerstown, Maryland is undoubtedly a big deal for Hagerstown.  At ORD, they&#8217;re in the midst of blowing as much as $20 billion on a program to rearrange the airport in the modern fashion with multiple well-spaced parallel runways.  Some of this may be justifiable in reducing operational issues in bad weather for the inframarginal flights, but a major justification was accommodating anticipated essentially unlimited growth in flights that someone projected out of past trend under the implicit assumption that cheap aviation, like cheap motoring, would go on forever.</p>
<p>Even half of that $20 billion would amount to an enormous investment in reasonably high-speed rail — Stephen Karlson of <a href="http://coldspringshops.blogspot.com/">Cold Spring Shops</a> argues persuasively that 300 km/h electrified bullet trains shouldn&#8217;t be made the enemy of very useful service capable of being implemented without such large investments in fixed capital (<a href="http://coldspringshops.blogspot.com/2008_05_01_archive.html#7081157696457523662">see here</a> for some links to his archives).  Since short-distance feeder flights congest big airports just about as much as long-distance jumbo jet services that may remain the efficient way to get people across oceans, you could theoretically de-congest hub airports to some degree with a well-planned investment in 180 km/h rail that would be a bargain in comparison to airport megaprojects, and provide more places with real modal choice in ground transportation essentially as a side-effect!</p>
<p>The catch is that doing so requires political will, both for the money and to deal with the need to make some people along the routes unhappy, and advance planning.  (E.g. it would take at least a couple years to extend the successful 130 km/h service between Milwaukee and Chicago the eighty miles or so to Madison even if the project were amply funded.)  Perfect foresight may be hard to come by, but right now it doesn&#8217;t take genius and a time machine to see that people are going to start wanting this stuff yesterday.</p>
<p>Along those lines, the presidential candidates are all somewhat disappointing, as preserving cheap motoring forms the bulk of their transportation policy positions.  However, members of the Pigou Club might note that the Obama campaign did at least bother to drop a paragraph in acknowledge that other transportation modes exist, whereas the <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/7366faf9-d504-4abc-a889-9c08d601d8ee.htm">space program</a> is more important to McCain than Amtrak.  (Recall that McCain recently picked up some Common Touch points from the press corps for riding the Acela Express instead of his wife&#8217;s jet, but is a long-standing opponent of Amtrak funding.)</p>

<p>Carlyle Group just bought Booz Allen Hamilton which does $3.5 (about $5B total corporate revenues) a year &#8220;consulting&#8221; for DoD.</p>
<p>Now Carlyle owns the consultants who will &#8220;advise&#8221; the DoD to keep to the &#8220;strategy and structure&#8221; of the think tanks and support investing in more and more potentially useless things from companies in which Carlyle has interests.</p>
<p>One of the longstanding strategies that drive expensive DoD structure is observable,: “continuous mobilization”:  Always being &#8220;ready&#8221; to fight a theoretical battle on the military industrial complex&#8217; terms defined by the think tanks and developed largely to sustain a profitable or health industry.  Never ask whether any of it is worth the expense of scarce national resources.</p>
<p>Some history:</p>
<p>Prior to 1950, the US prepared to fight the most expensive type of think tank theorized war.  This was to be &#8220;industrial age&#8221; war perfected prior to 1914 against the Red Army in Central Europe.  It included tactical nuclear forces to overcome logistical limitations and the size of enemy conventional forces.  Those of you around in the mid 50&#8217;s; did you get an Atomic Cannon for Christmas one year, like my baby brother?  Anyway, there was no think tank concerned for slogging it out in another 1936 Sino Japanese style light infantry war in Asia.  Mac Arthur presciently warned against a conventional war in Asia and his &#8220;run in&#8221; with Truman was less insubordination than demanding the president keep to the playbook.  </p>
<p>RAND helped to establish strategies to fight nuclear armegeddon, the Air Force who got tons more money than the Army and Navy, who got stuck fighting the wrong war in Korea in June 1950.</p>
<p>The Korea police action added the need for conventional war “continuous mobilization” to the nuclear warfare (Air Force pilots, every one a Capt Kirk) mission requirements.  </p>
<p>This renewed capability to fight Mao on his terms helped get the US stuck in Vietnam.  The think tanks developed new strategies and theories of conventional and unconventional warfare to sell anything from counterinsurgency warfare, Special Operations Command (SOCOM) to new super weapons to refight the Battle of Kursk.  Army brand think tanks devised &#8220;air mobile&#8221; doctrine first tried in Vietnam, and discredited, but revised for a Central European Armageddon, complete with Apache helicopters armed with tank busting rockets, supporting 60 ton tanks, that today blow up Toyotas in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Navy brand think tanks sell a dozen aircraft carrier battle groups to fight the battle of Midway again.  The Soviets never built a ship equal to one of ours.  No one today is working a carrier remotely equal to any US ship.  The Air Force lost its monopoly in nuclear warfare, as the Navy got its branding in nuclear Armageddon with Rickover&#8217;s Polaris/Poseidon/Trident nuclear submarine fleet.  Finally, the Navy brand kept their WW II North Atlantic anti submarine navy to guard the convoys going over to reinforce the US Army in Europe in holding back the Red Horde.</p>
<p>The Marines have their brand.  While the Navy has 3 navies for their dreams of expensive orders of battle, they keep a fourth navy for the Marines!!  That is the dozen or so Landing Ships and supporting ships that carry about a thousand Marines each.  All of which together could just about invest Saipan if someone were so rude as to take it from the US. </p>
<p>All these &#8220;branded&#8221; orders of battle, devised, revised and sustained by think tanks&#8217; whim, ratified by beltway bandits working in service office like Booz Allen consultants support the wishful thinking of building up the military industrial complex.</p>
<p>Continuous mobilization is based on faulty estimation of threats, such as the perennial estimation of the Red Army and now Islamic terror, created the most expensive, unneeded war machine that money could buy.  Lately, continuous mobilization termed &#8220;broad spectrum&#8221; warfare or more of the same preparing for the war they wish they could fight, and making a lot of money.</p>
<p>The folks who describe the beaks to be whittled are now part of the guys who make money on their dreams.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121124460502305693.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">David Ranson</a> repackages one of the usual suspects from the bag of lies from the rightwing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Will increasing tax rates on the rich increase revenues, as Barack Obama hopes, or hold back the economy, as John McCain fears? Or both? Mr. Hauser uncovered the means to answer these questions definitively. On this page in 1993, he stated that &#8220;No matter what the tax rates have been, in postwar America tax revenues have remained at about 19.5% of GDP.&#8221; What a pity that his discovery has not been more widely disseminated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Say what?  Regular readers of this blog might have seen this silly claim made by certain rightwing trolls many times.  I could demolish this line of nonsense by showing Federal revenue by source (individual income tax, corporate profits tax, and payroll tax) as a percent of GDP but <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/odd-numbers/2008/05/20/lying-with-charts-wsj-edition?rss=true">Zubin Jelveh</a> has already done so in his Lying with Charts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hmmm, corporate tax revenues have declined dramatically. Why, then haven&#8217;t overall tax revenues dropped? Well, we can primarily thank social insurance programs like Social Security for that. Here&#8217;s a chart showing social insurance program tax revenues</p></blockquote>
<p>Zubin also charts individual income taxes as a percent of GDP showing that this ratio did rise after the 1993 tax increase while it fell after the 2001 tax cut.  The claim made by Ranson has been made by many others – and it has been shown to be silly many times as well.  But the WSJ oped page does seem to be on a mission to outdo the National Review for the dumbest rightwing rag with respect to economics.</p>

<blockquote><p>Congress just moved a little closer to establishing your right to know for sewage spills. Last Thursday, the <a href="http://www.americanrivers.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&#038;id=11705&#038;news_iv_ctrl=1282">House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee</a> voted to pass the Sewage Right to Know bill (HR 2452) and send it to the full House for consideration. The bill now has the support of over 150 groups, including the <a href="http://www.thetimesonline.com/articles/2008/05/19/news/top_news/doc94899bcd250cf4648625744d007a1e6a.txt">National Association of Clean Water Agencies</a>, who represent many of the nation&#8217;s biggest sewer utilities.<br /><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-05-07-sewers-main_N.htm">USA Today</a> ran a great story last week highlighting our crumbling infrastructure and the need for increased investment (for more about our views on this, see my <a href="http://blog.americanrivers.org/wordpress/index.php/2008/02/29/where-has-all-the-money-gone/">earlier story</a>). <a href="http://blog.americanrivers.org/wordpress/index.php/2007/05/24/community-right-to-know-sewage-bill-introduced/">Right to know for sewage spills</a> is a straightforward idea whose time has come and will allow us to enjoy and appreciate our local streams and rivers, while staying healthy. This sort of recognition of the problem will get people to realize that continued investment in our water infrastructure is needed. Instead of <a href="http://usmayors.org/uscm/news/press_releases/documents/municipalwater_050108.pdf">paying high prices for bottled water</a> (pdf), let&#8217;s pay to protect our streams and rivers that provide many of us with reliable drinking water in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Water and our need to consider basic infrastructure cost have not been in the headlines except for highways and bridges. Water shortages tend to be discussed in relation to agriculture.</p>
<p>We made the investment in water and sanitation in an earlier day. Probably the issue won&#8217;t be part of the election campaign, but the costs of renewing our committement to basics are certainly greater than some of the issues front and center.</p>

                                                                            <a href="./../category/social-security/index.html" class="post-category-44" title="social security"><div class="color-box"></div>social security</a>                                                                     </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Or perhaps we could call this &#8216;Social Security basics as seen by Bruce&#8217;. In any event.</p>
<p>Some recent e-mail exchanges and comments have led me to conclude that there are certain misconceptions about Social Security finance, misconceptions that both feed on and feed into certain pernicious myths initiated by people who oppose Social Security on principle but want you to believe it is all about the finance.</p>
<p>The first misconception stems from the fact that the Treasury Department taken as a whole doesn&#8217;t need the equivalent of a Savings Account, that is a place to hold large amount of actual dollars in reserve. The reason is simple, when put in the crudest terms it not only has excellent credit which it exercises daily, if it comes to it Treasury owns the printing press. On the other hand it manages a number of programs who do need that equivalent of which the three largest are Social Security Retirement, Social Security Disability, and Medicare. So how do they handle this. Well the mechanism is simple, it just results in some conceptual confusion. More below the fold.<br />The mechanics of Social Security are pretty simple. The Federal Government collects taxes on wages and on high income benefits and then turns around and spends much to most of that right back out the door in the form of disability and retirement checks. If there are surpluses the money is credited to the Social Security Trust Fund which then turns around and invests them in the safest historical investment known, in this case a special type of T-Bill known as a Special Treasury. Like the case of all T-Bill sales the proceeds flow to the Treasury and are available for the government to spend as they like. Nothing wrong there, that is what happens when you buy a bond, they take the money, give you a promise to repay, and then they invest the money is hopefully productive ways. This is not &#8216;raiding&#8217;, this is not &#8216;looting&#8217;, but it is a promise that creates a specific future obligation, and is specifically booked as debt and shows up in the familiar $9 trillion total debt as seen on various debt clocks. Note too that this process can, and as we will see, has reversed. If there is a string of years when Income from taxes lags cost then the flow reverses, the General Fund makes up the difference and retires an equivalent amount of debt.</p>
<p>Which leads to myths one and two: the Great Raids of Johnson and Reagan. The narrative here suggests that Johnson raided Social Security Trust Funds to fund Vietnam and that Reagan raided it again to pay for the Cold War and that as a result the cupboard was left bare. This is just numeric nonsense and betrays both a misunderstanding of the nature of the Trust Fund and of the Special Treasuries they hold plus a total exaggeration of the dollars in question. The latter can be seen in <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds,Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a>. For our purposes the key columns are the right hand three under &#8216;Assets&#8217;. Taking the last first, the Trust Fund Ratio is the Trust Fund balance expressed as a ratio of time with 100=1 year. Legally the Trustees are supposed to monitor the Trust Fund ratio and alert Congress any time it falls out of Short Term Actuarial Balance, which is defined as a projected TF Ratio of at least 100 in each of the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Which gives us mythbuster one: any year that Social Security has a TF Ratio close to 100 is a year when nothing is being looted, instead the President, Congress and Trustees are all fulfilling their fiduciary responsibility. If we look at the table we see that Johnson maintained the Trust Funds at ratios between 97 and 110 at the end of each of his full years in office, and delivered a 101 ratio to his successor, in respect to Social Security he was practically the perfect steward. </p>
<p>Now if we look forward in time we see that Nixon allowed the TF ratio to fall below 100 and so out of Actuarial Balance, and that Ford and Carter did nothing about it. Though this made them perhaps poor stewards at one level, it didn&#8217;t make them thieves the direction of cash flow during these years was actually from the General Fund to Social Security (third column from right).</p>
<p>Which leads us to the Reagan Administration. Reagan inherited a lemon, Social Security was coming off a string of six years of cashing in Trust Fund assets with money from the General Fund, although all the bills had been paid and all legal obligations met, the cupboard was in fact bare. The ideologues were howling to just let it die, they hated Social Security from the beginning and were just waiting for their day to come. It came and Reagan let them down, instead he instituted a medium term fix.</p>
<p>Which puts the lie to myth 2: the Reagan raid. First if we look at the Trust Fund year by year (third column) we see that one, the dollar figures in any given year are not particularly big, with half of the total increase coming in the last year of his term. Second the Trust Fund ratio although improving was only up to 41. But there was no raid, instead there was a simple accumulation of investments to get the fund back on track to a TF ratio of 100. Whatever else his faults, Reagan is totally blameless over Social Security. He did his job.</p>
<p>As did Bush I. He didn&#8217;t do anything dramatic but he did deliver a Trust Fund with a ratio of 97 and clearly on track for Actuarial Balance.</p>
<p>Which gives rise to myth 3: pre-funding. Any year that the Social Security Trust Funds have a ratio of 100 or less they are not prefunding anything, in fact they are in actuarial imbalance and in effect under water, which was true for every year from 1971 to 1993. There was a real crisis in Social Security in the early eighties but collectively this country fulfilled its responsibilities to Social Security retirees. (Although I will hasten to note that the entire net bill was picked up by workers, capital&#8217;s role was limited to not actually wrecking the system). But there is no hard evidence I know of that the Commission ever thought of their efforts of doing more than returning it to actuarial balance, and a recent interview with the Executive Secretary of the Commission confirmed as much. While they did present a set of numbers that would do the job, they were hardly in a position to predict that series of years in the late nineties when Social Security was actually set on the path to solvency.</p>
<p>The state of affairs under the Clinton and Bush Administration is in fact somewhat of an anomaly but there it is. Current surpluses and current economic growth are coming in at rates that should allow us to pay all or almost all of benefits going fowards. If and only if we are vigilent enough to keep future governments simply fulfilling their fiduciary duty. And the politics of that will have to wait on another day and another post.</p>

<p>If the monied sloshers are as sensitive as they imply, maybe they aren&#8217;t so rational, and are actually in panic mode for the percentages all the time.  Having adrenaline in the brain everyday causes physical damage to brain function, and warps perceptions. </p>
<p>Ask any soldier on the front&#8230;it changes the mind.  And not for the good in civilian life.  You have to get rid of the adrenaline to function in a different, more peaceful setting.  </p>
<p>Our &#8216;rush&#8217; to gain percentage probably, over time, damages our common family and community as well.  Staying high all the time did not work for hippies, why should it work for sloshers?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Out here on the edge of the grain belt, my local newspaper&#8217;s editorial board today bravely <a href="http://www.madison.com/wsj/home/opinion/286786">stood up for biofuels</a>.  They argue, in part, that corn supply is not fixed:<br />
<blockquote>In 1995, before the ethanol boom began, American farmers produced 162 million metric tons of corn for food and export.</p>
<p>By 2007, ethanol production was taking 62 million metric tons of corn. So the corn left for food and export was — 308 million metric tons.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, 308 million metric tons — 82 percent more than before the ethanol boom, thanks to higher yields and more land in cornfields.</p></blockquote>
<p>Corn for everybody!  Almost makes you wonder why the price is so high.</p>
<p>While I don&#8217;t quite match their numbers with data from the <a href="http://www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/psdHome.aspx">USDA&#8217;s Foreign Agriculture Service</a>, corn production and supply have in fact increased since 1995 — though they managed to pick a relatively low-production year for their comparison:<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21392874@N00/2506788206/" title="U.S. Corn Production and Supply by atbozzo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3026/2506788206_b28b9ffe39.jpg" alt="U.S. Corn Production and Supply" height="342" width="500"></a><br />(Source: USDA Foreign Agriculture Service.  Click to embiggen.)</p>
<p>However, their characterization of ~300 million tons available for (human) consumption is misleading, and increased ethanol demand isn&#8217;t exactly a blip in the U.S. corn market.  Here&#8217;s a coarse breakdown of the corn crop&#8217;s uses:<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21392874@N00/2505958443/" title="U.S. Corn Uses by atbozzo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2017/2505958443_f2abca0f02.jpg" alt="U.S. Corn Uses" height="342" width="500"></a></p>
<p>Traditionally, the major use of corn has been for animal feed.  That&#8217;s been in a roughly 20 million metric ton range for the last ten years.  (Before the mid-90s, corn production was relatively volatile and a lot of the variation was reflected in animal feeding modes.)  Other food and industrial uses have usually taken second place, and exports have mostly fallen in the range of 40-60 million MT annually.</p>
<p>Since the USDA began breaking out ethanol as a source of corn demand in 2002/2003, it&#8217;s taken up an additional 50 megatons of corn.  Should the 2008/2009 ethanol forecast comes true, that&#8217;ll be more like 75 megatons.  Were that corn not indirectly pumped into American gas tanks, it could nearly triple U.S. corn exports; or, from another perspective, we&#8217;re set to use a bit more than an eighth of the <a href="http://www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/psdgetreport.aspx?hidReportRetrievalName=BVS&#038;hidReportRetrievalID=459&#038;hidReportRetrievalTemplateID=7">world crop</a> for fuel.  A couple more years of billion-bushel (~25 megaton) growth in corn directed to ethanol production and ethanol could take over from animal feed as corn&#8217;s primary use in the U.S.  This also goes to show that converting the entire current corn crop into ethanol <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fuel#Change_in_land_use">wouldn&#8217;t make much of a dent</a> in U.S. gasoline demand.</p>
<p>A curious (and worse) argument is that corn ethanol is a gateway to better future biofuel-production processes.  It strikes me that a lot of the current ethanol production capital in the U.S. is one way or another ill-suited either to currently more efficient sources of carbohydrates like sugar cane or to hypothetical cellulosic properties.  The big unit trains of ethanol tankers are mobile enough, but otherwise all these giant distilleries are in the middle of corn country for a reason, which is to say subsidy-farming.</p>

                                <p>I think he may believe it&#8217;s good news that the S&#038;P 500 forward valuation (what we believe we might make next year, having nothing necessarily to do with current earnings or actual sales) <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/05/stock-market-valuation.html">has returned, approximately, to the level of 1998</a>.*</p>
<p>The problem, as I noted <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2006/06/interlude-1b-how-cheap-is-market.html">more than two years ago</a>, is that, even ignoring that the numbers are more WAG than analysis, it&#8217;s still well above the historic levels that promise good returns.</p>
<p>So this, again, seems a good time to reproduce a graphic borrowed <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&#038;isbn=0393057828&#038;itm=1">Burton G. Malkiel</a> (it was on page 257 of a previous edition):</p>

<p>UPDATE:  I wasn&#8217;t clear enough in my initial post, so I&#8217;m pulling vtcodger from comments:<br />
<blockquote>Mankiw has a chart there. The label says it is S&#038;P500 PE Ratio. The numbers it shows are in the high 20s &#8212; which is consistent with my gut feeling that the stock market has been substantially overvalued for the past 15 years. Over the very long term PE ratios for healthy markets have typically been below 15.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s possible that something has changed since 1993 to make higher ratios more attractive.  But I wouldn&#8217;t bet that way, though <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/02/still-stocks-ra.html">Brad DeLong</a>, for one, appears to do so (though his argument is one of Relative, not intrinsic, Value).</p>
<p>*That is, two years after Saint Alan mumbled something about &#8220;irrational exuberance&#8221; and turned <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/">Robert Shiller</a> into a popular author.</p>
