<p>In an attempt to keep history accurate about sensible policies, this post points out the obvious source of the ban on drilling for oil off coast. So much for blame your favorite partisan in comments.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/washington/18drill.html?_r=1&#038;th&#038;emc=th&#038;oref=slogin">The NYT</a> mentions that Mr. Bush has long advocated opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to drilling, and in 2006 signed into law a bill that expanded exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. But the topic of coastal drilling has been an extremely sensitive one in the Bush family; Mr. Bush’s father, the first President Bush, signed an executive order in 1990 banning coastal oil exploration, and Mr. Bush’s brother Jeb was an outspoken opponent of offshore drilling when he was governor of Florida.</p>
<p>Now, though, President Bush is considering repealing his father’s order.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Coal-fired generating capacity is <a href="http://www.madison.com/tct/business/291631">decreasingly cheap</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The cost for Alliant Energy&#8217;s controversial proposed new coal power plant has soared to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, the company stated in a regulatory filing.</p>
<p>Alliant previously said the new plant proposed to be the third unit of the Nelson Dewey Generating Station in Cassville would cost $850 million to $950 million. When initially proposed in 2007, the plant&#8217;s cost estimate was under $800 million.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s $1.2 billion for 300 MW.  This is blamed on producer-price inflation:<br />
<blockquote>Company officials said the increases stem from soaring construction costs that include big cost hikes for items such as concrete and steel.</p></blockquote>
<p>In case you were thinking that the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ppi/home.htm">BLS</a> was incapable of finding inflation, the PPI for iron and steel is up 32.6% year-over-year (NSA), and while PPI for concrete ingredients are &#8220;only&#8221; up 4.6% over 2007, the 3-year average annual rate to last month is 7.8%.</p>
<p>This is also an obstacle to plans for new nuclear generating capacity in electricity decarbonization <a href="http://climateprogress.org/2008/03/20/mccains-non-straight-talk-on-nuclear-power/">a la McCain</a>, since nuclear plants are also plenty steel-and-concrete intensive.</p>
<p>Wind and solar are also construction-cost intensive, but some of that can be offset by economies from mass-production of components.  Were I a betting person, I&#8217;d expect that little of the projected new nuclear generation will ever show up, and that the renewables projections are low.</p>

Which brings me to the following item (have you noticed?)</p>
<blockquote><p>But as packaged goods makers&#8217; costs rise, they eventually have just two choices: raise prices or put less stuff in the package. While most are trying a price boost first, a growing number are shrinking the contents of their packages &#8211; from Frito Lay&#8217;s chips to Dial soap to Dreyer&#8217;s ice cream.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did not in any way try to hide this,&#8221; insists Tim Kahn, CEO of Dreyer&#8217;s Grand Ice Cream, which also makes &#8211; and has shrunk &#8211; Edy&#8217;s. &#8220;The package-size change couldn&#8217;t be any more visible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Driving forces behind the downsizing: Commodity costs are way up. Egg prices rose 44.9% from April 2007 through April 2008, reports the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Corn costs rose 69.5%. And wheat rose 96.9%. Energy prices also are up. So are packaging costs.</p>
<p>Typically, shoppers are asked to pay more, but these are not typical times. Raising prices when strapped consumers are price-sensitive can be a formula for disaster. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s often less in the box instead.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update: <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/06/why-were-so-gloomy/">Economist Mom</a> makes the story so much more articulate for the cognitive crowd. Thanks mom.</p>
<blockquote><p>I have a different theory. I think the excessive gloominess in the current ”cyclical downturn” is because Americans are feeling as if a good part of the economic downturn might not just be cyclical (temporary)–that much of what we’re seeing in the short-run economy is symptomatic of longer-run challenges that aren’t going to go away within the next few months or even years.</p>
<p>As we fill up our gas tanks each day, do we really think gasoline prices are going to go back to $2/gallon in a few months? As we see our home values–and the equity we can tap into–falling, do we expect to get back to relying on that “wealth” to help pay for our kids’ college educations or our own retirements? As our family budgets are squeezed by rising health care bills and wages that can’t keep up with even general inflation, do we have faith that the government will get that health care inflation under control soon? As my auto-engineer sister and brother-in-law in the Detroit area worry about their job security, do they expect that on the other side of the current downturn, the layoffs will stop? As we hear the bad news about this year’s federal budget deficit, are we comforted by what the presidential candidates are proposing?</p></blockquote>
<p>Few track this and those who do, such as The Nielsen Co., are tight-lipped about the data except to their clients, who pay big bucks for the proprietary stats. But Nielsen&#8217;s executive for consumer insights says up to 30% of packaged goods have lost content over the past year. Some prices went down, others did not.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve seen anything like this since I&#8217;ve been in the industry,&#8221; says Todd Hale, who has been with Nielsen for 29 years.<br />

<blockquote>In an unscientific visit to a supermarket this month, Lynn Dornblaser, new-products guru at market tracker Mintel, looked at 100 products and found about 10% appeared to have shrunk in contents, but not in price.</p>
<p>Many were from the most familiar brands. Companies don&#8217;t like to discuss it, but here are examples:</p>
<p>Less crunch. Since January, Frito-Lay has cut the number of chips in bags across all brands from Lay&#8217;s to Doritos, though not all product sizes, spokeswoman Aurora Gonzalez says. The biggest cut was to some 12-ounce bags of chips, which are now 10. Some Frito-Lay offerings got higher prices.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are common practices,&#8221; says Gonzalez, who faulted rising costs of commodities, energy, production and distribution. &#8220;We determined the best actions based on the products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hold the mayo. A jar of Hellmann&#8217;s mayonnaise that was 32 ounces is now 30. &#8220;The price of our ingredients has gone up dramatically,&#8221; says Dean Mastrojohn, a Unilever spokesman. &#8220;Manufacturing and transportation costs also have increased significantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spread thinner. Shedd&#8217;s Spread Country Crock was shrunk from 48 ounces to 45, due to higher commodity and energy costs, Unilever&#8217;s Mastrojohn says.</p>
<p>Grain shortage. The price of grains has been rising for a while, in part due to increased demand for corn to produce ethanol. Kellogg downsized Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies and Mini-Wheats in 2006. Boxes shrank from 24.3 ounces to 24 and from 19 ounces to 18. &#8220;I am not aware of consumer issues surrounding this downsizing,&#8221; spokeswoman Susanne Norwitz says.</p>
<p>General Mills began downsizing cereals last June. Some boxes of Cheerios and Wheaties shrank as much as 1.5 ounces. &#8220;Prior to the change, our package sizes were larger, in many cases, than competitors&#8217;,&#8221; spokeswoman Heidi Geller says.</p>
<p>Such reductions persuaded unemployed Aurora, Colo., resident Susan Kural to switch from top cereal brands to store brands. &#8220;Why should I buy 14 ounces when I can get 16?&#8221;</p>
<p>Slippery soap. Early this year, Henkel of America downsized its Dial soap bath bar from 4.5 ounces to 4, says Scott Moffitt, Dial&#8217;s Personal Care senior vice president.</p>
<p>The decision was primarily due to the skyrocketing cost of tallow, the natural fat from cattle that&#8217;s a key ingredient in the soap.</p>
<p>Less bountiful. This spring, Bounty cut the number of towels on a roll from 60 to 52. Procter &#038; Gamble spokeswoman Celeste Kuta says the reduction was because the sheets are now &#8220;improved&#8221; and thicker.</p>
<p>Buyer beware &#8211; of unit price</p>
<p>More than ever, Dornblaser says, consumers need to check the tags on the shelf that list price per ounce, the so-called unit cost, rather than just the total price. &#8220;When consumers find it tough to pay bills, one of the things they look at first is what they&#8217;re paying for products,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>If consumers want to check to see if they still are getting now what they used to get for their money, self-dubbed supermarket guru Phil Lempert says the best way is to hold onto supermarket register receipts for several months and then compare them. Most receipts not only show prices, but sizes of items.</p>
<p>Lempert says packaged goods makers should have to put the word &#8220;new&#8221; on the label if they take away even 1 ounce and explain very clearly what was changed.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because a typical supermarket has 50,000 products, while the average shopper spends just 24 minutes getting groceries. &#8220;When you&#8217;ve got a screaming kid or two with you,&#8221; Lempert says, you need a heads-up on product changes.</p>
<p>Few shoppers notice subtle changes in product contents, says Bonnie Tandy Leblang, the syndicated supermarket columnist. &#8220;Most just toss things in the grocery cart.&#8221; </p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aqSG6nUVmZfY&#038;refer">Bloomberg</a> must think so as they reported the following from McCain as a fact:</p>
<blockquote><p>McCain, in his speech, said small business is crucial to creating jobs &#8220;in this very tough time&#8221; for the U.S. economy. &#8220;I intend to keep the current low income and investment tax rates,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I will pursue tax reform that supports the wage-earners and job-creators who make this economy run.&#8221; He said Obama&#8217;s plans would subject 21.6 million small- business owners to income-tax increases.</p></blockquote>
<p>This bothered <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200806170011">Media Matters</a> who correctly state:</p>
<blockquote><p>according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, only 481,000 small businesses fall into the tax brackets that would be affected by those increases.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s now but could it be that the impact of Obama’s tax proposal might just be to create an additional 21 million new small businesses?  Talk about “creating jobs”!  <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/nothing-has-been-learned">Paul Krugman</a> has so more fun with the lies of McCain and the gullibility of the press:</p>
<blockquote><p>Year after year we’ve seen the Bush administration play childish games with the numbers; my favorite was the claim that cutting the tax rate on dividends was a gift to senior citizens, because the benefits would go disproportionately to people over 65. The reason, of course, is that most very rich people are also old.  So John McCain makes a typically Bush-like conflation: there are 21 million small business owners; there are small business owners in the top two tax brackets; therefore, Barack Obama plans to raise taxes on 21 million small businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t despair Paul – McCain’s mendacity is writing all sorts of jokes for us.  Alas – MSM seems to have no sense of humor.</p>

<blockquote><p>Aggressively moving to shift the debate away from domestic issues to national security, the McCain campaign hit Obama with some of the most incendiary language of the campaign, accusing Obama on a conference call with reporters moments ago of having a &#8220;September 10th mindset.&#8221;  The latest attack, which has strong echoes of the tactics Bush used against John Kerry four years ago and that Republicans used against Dems in 2006, comes in response to comments Obama made yesterday to ABC News about the attackers of the World Trade Center in 1993.  In the interview, Obama suggested that the failure to try Guantanamo detainees was harming American credibility in the Muslim world, adding that the 1993 attackers had been dealt with in accordance with the Constitution and that &#8220;they are currently in U.S. prisons, incapacitated.&#8221;  The McCain camp is seizing on the comments as evidence that Obama doesn&#8217;t understand that such an approach is inadequate to the current war on terror &#8212; even though Obama has repeatedly outlined an aggressive approach to hunting down terrorists.  &#8220;Once again, we have seen that Senator Obama is a perfect manifestation of a September 10th mindset,&#8221; McCain foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess this means Team McCain approves of these internments at Guantanamo even if they skirt the provisions of our Constitution.  Or as <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Politics/Story?id=5178123&#038;page=3">Obama</a> put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>What it means is, is that they have been willing to skirt basic protections that are in our Constitution, that our founders put in place. And it is my firm belief that we can track terrorists, we can crack down on threats against the United States, but we can do so within the constraints of our Constitution. And there has been no evidence on their part that we can&#8217;t. And, you know, let&#8217;s take the example of Guantanamo. What we know is that, in previous terrorist attacks &#8212; for example, the first attack against the World Trade Center, we were able to arrest those responsible, put them on trial. They are currently in U.S. prisons, incapacitated. And the fact that the administration has not tried to do that has created a situation where not only have we never actually put many of these folks on trial, but we have destroyed our credibility when it comes to rule of law all around the world, and given a huge boost to terrorist recruitment in countries that say, &#8220;Look, this is how the United States treats Muslims.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/06/obama_campaign_rolls_out_richa.php">Richard Clarke</a> also weighed in:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m frankly disgusted at my friends on the McCain campaign,&#8221; Clarke said, perhaps being a bit optimistic in describing those folks as still being &#8220;friends&#8221; of his. Clark referred to the McCain camp&#8217;s claim that Dems only favor a law enforcement approach to terrorism, and accused McCain advisers of &#8220;completely and utterly distorting the record of that party.&#8221;  &#8220;They said that about Bill Clinton,&#8221; Clarke continued. &#8220;They said that about John Kerry. And now they&#8217;re saying it about Barack Obama. I&#8217;d like them to show where in the record Barack Obama has favored only a law enforcement approach.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Then again – the slime that has infested the modern GOP will likely attack Mr. Clarke.  As you know, they’ve done it before.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f94b6be0-3c8a-11dd-b958-0000779fd2ac.html">It could be China&#8217;s</a>, for one.  The FT reminds us that there are income and substitution effects:<br />
<blockquote>Even though GM does not officially sell Hummers in China, a booming grey market has developed. In Beijing alone, more than 15 car dealers are selling the tank-like vehicles to China’s army of new car-buyers.</p>
<p>Hummers have become particularly popular among the wealthy urbanites who like to spend their holidays on long driving treks across the country.</p></blockquote>
<p>The trend is abetted by the government, since like a moderately terrifying portion of the developing world, China subsidizes motor fuel at retail:<br />
<blockquote>With demand for oil growing at 8 per cent a year, mostly met by imports, the country is the biggest contributor to the annual increase in oil consumption. Yet its petrol and diesel prices are as much as 40 per cent below US levels – themselves low by European standards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since China still has legions of the dirt-poor, and only the relatively well-to-do can afford cars (even if many of the new auto market participants aren&#8217;t rich by Western standards), this is a major case of upward redistribution.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for a cross-cultural brand presence (or is that penetration?) laugh:<br />
<blockquote>Beijing Auto has a military-style SUV called the Trojan.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In his eternal quest for the Republican presidential nomination, the supposed maverick John McCain has repeatedly reversed long-held positions and compromised purportedly core principles. From the Bush tax cuts, the religious right and immigration reform to overturning Roe v. Wade, proclaiming Samuel Alito a model Supreme Court Justice and bashing France (just to name a few), McCain changed sides as changing political conditions dictated. But over the past two weeks, McCain’s rapid fire, acrobatic flip-flops have produced whiplash, at least for voters. 10 times since the beginning of June, McCain has retreated from, upended or just forgotten positions he once claimed as his own. On Social Security, balancing the budget, defense spending, domestic surveillance and a host of other issues so far this month, McCain’s “Straight Talk Express” did a U-turn on the road to the White House.</p></blockquote>
<p>John discusses each of the ten flip-flops over the past couple of weeks.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_06/013922.php">Kevin Drum</a> may have found #11:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is McCain confused again? Maybe, but more likely it&#8217;s just politics as usual, a way of being all things to all people. He wants credit for taking climate change seriously but he also wants credit for being business friendly, so he offers up a cap-and-trade plan and then insists that it doesn&#8217;t actually involve a cap. This is garden variety double talk, but he can get away with it because he knows that no one in the press corps will actually challenge him on an issue of substantive policy.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p> The Army official who managed the Pentagon’s largest contract in Iraq says he was ousted from his job when he refused to approve paying more than $1 billion in questionable charges to KBR, the Houston-based company that has provided food, housing and other services to American troops.</p>
<p>The official, Charles M. Smith, was the senior civilian overseeing the multibillion-dollar contract with KBR during the first two years of the war. Speaking out for the first time, Mr. Smith said that he was forced from his job in 2004 after informing KBR officials that the Army would impose escalating financial penalties if they failed to improve their chaotic Iraqi operations.</p>
<p>Army auditors had determined that KBR lacked credible data or records for more than $1 billion in spending, so Mr. Smith refused to sign off on the payments to the company. “They had a gigantic amount of costs they couldn’t justify,” he said in an interview. “Ultimately, the money that was going to KBR was money being taken away from the troops, and I wasn’t going to do that.” </p>
<p>But he was suddenly replaced, he said, and his successors — after taking the unusual step of hiring an outside contractor to consider KBR’s claims — approved most of the payments he had tried to block.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Soon after Mr. Smith was replaced, the Army hired a contractor, RCI Holding Corporation, to review KBR’s costs. “They came up with estimates, using very weak data from KBR,” Mr. Smith said. “They ignored D.C.A.A.’s auditors,” he said, referring to the Defense Contract Audit Agency.</p>
<p>Lt. Col. Brian Maka, a Pentagon spokesman, disputed that. He said in a statement that the Army auditing agency “does not believe that RCI was used to circumvent” the Army audits. </p>
<p>Paul Heagen, a spokesman for RCI’s parent company, the Serco Group, said his firm had insisted on working with the Army auditors. While KBR did not provide all of the data Mr. Smith had been seeking, Mr. Heagen said his company had used “best practices” and sound methodology to determine KBR’s costs. </p>
<p><em>Bob Bauman, a former Pentagon fraud investigator and contracting expert, said that was unusual. “I have never seen a contractor given that position, of estimating costs and scrubbing D.C.A.A.’s numbers,” he said. “I believe they are treading on dangerous ground.”</em></p>
<p><em>The Army also convened boards that awarded KBR high performance bonuses, according to Mr. Smith. </em></p>
<p>High grades on its work in Iraq also allowed KBR to win more work from the Pentagon, and this spring, KBR was awarded a share in the new 10-year contract. The Army also announced that Serco, RCI’s parent, will help oversee the Army’s new contract with KBR.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Italics are mine)</p>
<p>Serco has been hired to oversee the whole Iraq operation.  I wonder if the situation becomes somewhat analagous to Anderson and Enron?  These changes are astounding in magnitude.</p>

<p>GAO is describing personal services in this quote &#8220;&#8221;Contractors are generally not subject to the same ethics rules as government employees even when they are collocated and work side by side with federal employees and perform similar functions.&#8221;   <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08572t.pdf">From GAO 08-572T</a> Testimony pg 11. </p>
<p>The following is cut from Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37 Service Contracting: Part 37.104 Personal Services Contracts: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Obtaining personal services by contract, rather than by direct hire, circumvents those laws unless Congress has specifically authorized acquisition of the services by contract.”<br />(b) “Agencies shall not award personal services contracts unless specifically authorized by statute (e.g., 5 U.S.C.3109) to do so.   That code states that any use of advisory services beyond a year requires approval by congress.<br />(d) “The following descriptive elements should be used as a guide in assessing whether or not a proposed contract is personal in nature”: <br />(1) “Performance on site”. <br />(2) “Principal tools and equipment furnished by the Government”. <br />(3)’ Services are applied directly to the integral effort of agencies or an organizational subpart in furtherance of assigned function or mission.” <br />(4)”Comparable services, meeting comparable needs, are performed in the same or similar agencies using civil service personnel.” <br />(5) “The need for the type of service provided can reasonably be expected to last beyond 1 year.” <br />(6) “The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which it is provided, reasonably requires directly or indirectly, Government direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to— <br />(i) “Adequately protect the Government’s interest”; <br />(ii) “Retain control of the function involved; or” <br />(iii) “Retain full personal responsibility for the function supported in a duly authorized Federal officer or employee.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Support contractors do technical work which constitutes personal services.  The shadow government exists and violates law and rule.  But who wants all us “old lady in tennis shoes” civil servants who can get away saying the &#8220;emperor has no clothes&#8221; even if we must survive the whistleblower retaliation.<br />When I retired from civil service I was an A&#038;AS contractor for several years until I finally could not look the pay master in the eye.  In the several positions I held I did personal services, as did all the others in the several commands I supported. <br />What has occurred since the Cold War is the government manpower drawdown has been superficial and the work has been shifted to contractors.  This is reflected in the high cost of the much smaller military.</p>
<p>The shift has been hidden and at least in the areas GAO reports no competitive sourcing analysis has been done.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />This one by ilsm</p>

<p>Revenue Compression in the Physician Office</p>
<p>As Rdan&#8217;s request, a not-too-technical review of revenue compression.</p>
<p>There is never enough money for health care, so the various constituencies are constantly  maneuvering for their piece of the pie.</p>
<p>Physicians have some advantage in the piece of pie contest as physicians are the gatekeepers for most of the system.</p>
<p>Physicians are a target though because they bill so many units of service (office encounters and surgeries).</p>
<p>Both private and government  (Medicaid and Medicare) payers are constantly trying to ratchet down or hold fees.</p>
<p>Medicaid has never paid very well, the best physicians can hope for is prompt payment.</p>
<p>Medicare has been a back bone of the system but has never been extravagant.</p>
<p>Medicare has always been based on &#8220;cost shifting,&#8221; Medicare pays lower fees and providers are supposed to make it up by better payments from private insurers. These days it is tougher as private insurers ratchet down fees as well.</p>
<p>The would not be so bad but costs are escalating in physician offices (labor, IT, supplies, equipment, malpractice insurance, etc.), and most of those costs behave as fixed costs. There are some variable costs (injectibles and vaccines, casting materials, etc.). **</p>
<p>The Bush administration has been trying to limit or decrease Medicare fees, and there is an annual dance where Congress restores the fees with a small increase. I think most of the Bears understand the long term financial picture for Medicare.</p>
<p>So physicians update and increase fee schedules, but almost no one pays retail. Say the charge for a mid-level office call is $120, actual receipts might range from $44 (Medicaid) to $100 (best private). The fee is set where it is for regulatory reasons.</p>
<p>Some private pay contracts actually are a multiple of Medicare rates, so the change in Medicare rates ripples through private rates, either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>So, physicians have very little control over costs, and very little control over revenues.</p>
<p>Physicians have some strategies for improving collections, and the best strategy in a fixed cost environment is volume. There are limits to volume.</p>
<p>** When you hear a physician say &#8220;I lose money on every Medicare patient!&#8221; it is because they do not understand CVP analysis. The margin is lower on Medicare patients, it is unlikely the margin is negative.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Update: H/t to robertdfeinman for this link to <a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.org/">Health Beat Blog</a></p>
<p>Rdan here.<br />The above was written in relation to Medicare D and its impact on prices paid by Medicare on the insurance payment system and reimbursements for doctors.</p>
<p>What is the <em>minimum wage </em>or price floor for a US born doctor? </p>
<p>At a local hospital the doctors on staff are mostly Indian, nurses are white US trained, and PCAs are Latino.  Many doctors not &#8220;on staff&#8221; have combined their private practices with being &#8216;on call&#8217; and consulting to the hospital in adjoining buildings, a sort of hybrid arrangement to working for the hospital.</p>
<p>I suspect reforming the US medical system in the real world will be complex and messy.  Discusssion can be done from a macro or a micro viewpoint, and can include anything from &#8216;no change is needed&#8217; to some sort of &#8216;universal&#8217; healthcare plan.</p>
<p>It is incumbent on regulars, however, to link to good arguments or create one with data.  This can include examples in real world business management, patient anecdotes for illustrative purposes, data for aggregates, policy effects and unintended effects, and if possible links to past AB posts on the matter to avoid simple repetition of talking points.</p>
<p>A micro point of information does not necessarily need a grand discussion of private vs public policy. Knowing how a doctor budgets can be a valuable piece of information in its own right.  And a blog format appears to limit the amount of information that can be handled on any one post.  Hence sometimes to limit the scope of discussion of a post has value.</p>
