<p>Social Security/Medicare vs Corporate Welfare</p>
<p>The denouement of the fiscal cliff debate behind us (and not, I regret, with the best results&#8211;more on that later) we now face the next stage, in which we can expect the right-side extremists to threaten to hold the government hostage unless spending is cut (meaning, to the right-side, spending for people-oriented projects like the safety net but not extending generally to spending on the military or the corporate welfare with which the tax code was reinforced through the fiscal cliff deal that extended or made permanent many of the notorious giveaways from the Bush years) and debt is limited.</p>
<p>All of this will be pushed by those in the &#8220;tea party&#8221; and Koch-funded right-wing as so-called &#8220;fiscal conservatism.&#8221;</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t.  The agenda on the right is about as far from fiscal conservatism as anything can be.  The right is quite happy to take a &#8220;no tax increases forever&#8221; position, at that same time as gleefully opting for more and more expansive defense and defense-related spending.  Similarly, the fiscal cliff deal with its reinforcement of corporate welfare in the extension or making permanent of the Bush year corporate tax giveaways demonstrates that there is hardly a corporate tax expenditure that this gang doesn&#8217;t like.  Take two examples:  the R&#038;D credit and the &#8220;active financing&#8221; exception to Subpart F. 
<ul>
<li>The R&#038;D credit allows companies to understate their corporate income by giving a dollar-for-dollar credit for R&#038;D expenditures.  The purported objective is to encourage more R&#038;D.  But this credit was examined closely ages ago and came up short&#8211;it really is just a subsidy to corporations (like Big Pharm) that do considerable research.  And those companies happen to be companies that HAVE to do considerable research to stay competitive.  The subsidy just comes along for the ride; it doesn&#8217;t drive the research.  This is evidenced by the fact that several times the temporary subsidy was extended after the year of the research had closed&#8211;there is no way that a retroactive subsidy can incentivize additional research in a past year! </li>
<li>The &#8220;active financing&#8221; exception lets banks forego immediate Subpart F taxation on their international interest and dividend income, because, they say, that&#8217;s their &#8220;active&#8221; business.  But then of course they are encouraged to locate as much passive income in those active financing subsidiaries as possible, to be able to exempt as much as possible from Subpart F immediate taxation.  It is just one of the many crutches we give multinational banks, yet they continue to be a genuine risk for the US economy and a genuine risk for again requiring US bailouts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other corporate welfare examples include everything from the continuing subsidy (after more than a 100 years of profits) to Big Oil and other natural resource extraction, to Big Pharm and Big IT from inadequate rules against the so-called sales of critical IT property to offshore affiliates, to companies that set up captive insurance companies, and to companies that use the vastly frontloaded &#8220;expensing&#8221; of equipment purchases through the accelerated depreciation system and the more recently added separate expensing provisions.  (On the latter:  The benefit of frontloading is considerable deferral of taxes, which means higher profits to the companies and lower revenues to the government.  It might arguably make sense as a temporary stimulus from time to time, but it has been a permanent part of our system now for more than a decade and is not justifiable in that framework.)</p>

<p>So corporate welfare should be what is cut, not Social Security or Medicare benefits, when we start looking at areas where cash is senselessly flowing in ways that don&#8217;t further the quality of life of typical Americans.  See Carl Gibson, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-gibson/cut-corporate-welfare-not_b_2421340.html?view=print&#038;comm_ref=false">Cut Corporate Welfare, Not the Safety Net</a>, HuffPost Politics (Jan. 7, 2013). </p>
<p>As Gibson notes,</p>
<blockquote><p>In Congress&#8217; latest &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; deal that supposedly had to be passed in order to avoid economic calamity, we spent <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/31/unemployment-insurance-extended_n_2389634.html">$30 billion</a> on extending unemployment benefits for a year, and <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/01/eight-corporate-subsidies-in-the-fiscal-cliff-bill-from-goldman-sachs-to-disney-to-nascar.html">$205 billion</a> in corporate tax breaks, subsidies and excessive tax loopholes. Most of these Christmas gifts for corporate America are benefiting major, multi-billion dollar corporations that <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2011/11/03/360185/30-corporations-no-taxes/">haven&#8217;t paid a dime of U.S. income taxes in years</a>, like GE and Boeing. In other words, taxpayers spent six times more on giving free money to companies making record profits than we did to making sure the people who were laid off by these corporations can still feed their families. $205 billion in corporate goodies was okay with Speaker Boehner, but <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2013-01-04/news/36132767_1_votes-on-sandy-aid-christie-sandy-victims">$60 billion</a> in Hurricane Sandy relief apparently wasn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the New York Times today hit on another of the absurd subsidies that crept into our Code in a well-intentioned provision to help small farmers but has resulted in most real estate investors seldom paying taxes on their gains and many corporations using the device to avoid millions in taxes annually.  That&#8217;s the &#8220;section 1031&#8221; like-kind exchange.  There&#8217;s really no normative policy justification for allowing this kind of exchange to avoid taxation of the realized gain whereas other exchanges (non-like-kind) do not.  There is even less justification for the avoidance of taxation for the kinds of intermediary exchanges that have evolved over time, allowing actual sales to occur, so long as the seller ensures that the money is put into an escrow account until it is used to buy &#8220;replacement&#8221; property.  While it is hard to see any real justification for any of the like-kind exchange provisions, and certainly not for the intermediated sales + replacement regimes, it is especially problematic when the intermediated regimes become subject to abuse&#8211;where intermediaries allow the exchanging taxpayer full access to the cash, e.g., as collateral for loans, etc. during the period when no use is permitted.  The New York Times covered that issue today.  See David Kocieniewski, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/business/economy/companies-exploit-tax-break-for-asset-exchanges-trial-evidence-shows.html">Major Companies Push the Limits of a Tax Br</a>eak, New York Times (Jan. 6, 2013).</p>
<blockquote><p>The federal government now allows more than $1.1 trillion a year in this and other tax expenditures. Each of those incentives — which include hundreds of exemptions, exclusions, deferrals and preferential rates — either adds to the budget deficit or shifts the cost of government to other taxpayers.<br />Some are narrowly targeted and offer aid to specific industries like Nascar owners, asparagus farmers, oil companies, yacht makers or solar panel producers. Others, like accelerated depreciation or the tax code’s preference for debt financing over equity, provide tax benefits for wide swaths of businesses.<br />“Tax expenditures are very similar to an entitlement program, so they’re easy to start,” said George K. Yin, former chief of staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, and now <a href="http://www.law.virginia.edu/lawweb/faculty.nsf/fhpbi/1223683">a professor</a> at the University of Virginia School of Law. “But once a tax break gets started, people think they’re entitled to it, so they are very difficult to end.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Professor Yin has it exactly right&#8211;those tax breaks are very &#8220;easy to start&#8221; and very lucrative for corporations.  Once they get them, they will say (as the real estate people do here) that jobs depend on keeping them going.  That is usually not true, or much less of an impact than claimed.  But Congress caves easily on those items, and we go on with a giveaway code for Big Business.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Now the old world can address the fiscal imbalance of the new.  It seems that some of the best minds in the USA are trying to figure out how the US Treasury can disburse money without issuing debt.   Finally a topic I know something about.  There are many ways.</p>
<p>1) Paul Krugman proposes <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/moral-obligation-coupons/">Moral Obligation Coupons</a>.  OK so that&#8217;s just one of the best minds, but he has a very good mind.</p>
<p>2) Everyone proposes minting a <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/be-ready-to-mint-that-coin/">$ trillion Platinum coin</a> including Josh Non Ricardian Equivalence Barro.  I&#8217;d just add that the coin should be made now and Obama should carry it in his pocket when <strike>negotiating </strike>uh refusing to negotiate so he can pull it out and threaten to tell Geithner to declare it worth $ trillion.</p>
<p>3) It&#8217;s Greek to me.  Look over here we are very expert in borrowing without issuing debt.  How do you think Greece managed to get so deep in debt ?     The trick (<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/step-aside-greece-how-gustavo-piga-exposed-europes-enron-2001-focusing-italys-libor-minus-16">described by my colleague Gustavo Piga</a>) is to make a very bad speculative bet.  Greece (following a country which will remain nameless) made REPO deals with banks involving currency exchange &#8212; the bank gave Greece a great deal on the spot market and Greece gave the banks a great deal on the forward market.  In effect the deal consisted of an actual arms length market priced speculative position and a loan.  But since they were officially linked, it was not 100% certain that Greece would be paying the banks when the futures contract matured.  So by only for governments allowed accounting practices, Greece had not issued debt.</p>
<p>I think it would be best to explain exactly what is being done and how failure to raise the debt limit could cause the US to act like Greece this March.</p>
<p>4) Preferred shares.  OK this is close to 1.  Preferred shares are not debt. The whole key to TARP was that preferred shares are not debt.  Government agencies can issue preferred shares and the Fed can buy them.</p>
<p>5) Gagnon style.  heyyyy what about just good ol Fannie and Freddie ?  IIRC They are only 85% owned by the Federal Government exactly so that their debt does not appear as Federal debt.  86% and the balance sheets would have to be unified.  They owe the Treasury a lot of money.  They can issue debt instruments which the Fed can buy for an absurdly high price.  They can repay their debt to the Treasury.  Now they would have to have something to sell (say absurdly over priced MBS so it would be Gagnon style QE too).  Of course dealing with DeMarco might make dealing with Republicans in Congress seem easy.</p>
<p>6) If potential US Treasury default isn&#8217;t a financial crisis, I don&#8217;t know what is.  The Fed can lend to any entity during a financial crisis.  I think they could make 0 interest loans to federal contractors to be repaid when the Treasury pays them in exchange for their not billing the government.</p>
<p>7) Ask the big banks for a bailout.  What goes around comes around.  We saved them when they were in trouble.  They can give money to the US Treasury.  These are moral obligation coupons again.  They can demand limits on, say, compensation of Congress persons as part of the deal ala TARP.</p>

<div dir="ltr">In the wake of the fiscal deal raising taxes only on income over $450,000, Republicans are declaring that the debate over taxes is finished. The next fiscal deal will contain nothing in new revenues. Yesterday, Mitch McConnell <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/sen-mitch-mcconnell-tax-issue-finished-151934787--abc-news-politics.html">said</a>:</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">“The tax issue is finished. Over. Completed. That’s behind us. Now the question is what are we going to do about the biggest problem confronting our country and that’s our spending addiction. We didn’t have this problem because we weren’t taxing enough.”</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">As <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/111664/mcconnell-taxes-behind-us-meet-the-press-obama-debt-ceiling-sequester-cuts">Jonathan Cohn notes this morning</a>, this talking point may have some potency: Hey, we just raised taxes on the rich, so the next bite at the apple should be focused on spending cuts, right? So it’s worth putting the GOP demand in clearer perspective. What Republicans are saying here is that they intend to use the debt ceiling as hostage to ensure that all of the deficit reduction in the coming “grand bargain” is paid for by spending cuts — such as cuts to entitlements and other social programs — with not a penny coming from new revenues via the closing of loopholes and deductions enjoyed by the rich.</div>

<p>A hallmark of the Romney campaign was its pathological tendency to make bald misrepresentations of fact and to reiterate and reiterate the misrepresentation even after almost everyone knew it was false.  Sometimes everyone knew the statement was false as soon as the statement was made; it contradicted what everyone already knew.  Other times&#8211;or at least one other time&#8211;everyone knew the statement was false after, say, the CEO of the auto company that Romney said was closing a major plant in Ohio and moving the jobs to China said in a highly-publicized statement what everyone in or near the locality of the plant already knew: that the story was false and that the plant had recently expanded and was about to increase its workforce there.  And still other times, everyone learned that the statement was false because the Obama PAC corrected the misrepresentation with TV commercials, or the news media pointed out often enough that the statement was false. </p>
<p>But those misstatements of fact didn’t concern technical matters of law or economic fact that almost no one actually knows.  Which is why the debt ceiling matter is so susceptible of misrepresentation that “raising the debt ceiling” means increasing budget appropriations, when actually it means making available enough money to pay bills already accrued from earlier budget appropriations.  This is a technical issue made in Tea Party heaven, albeit many decades before the Tea Party was born. </p>
<p>So, isn’t it paramount the president explain to the public what the debt ceiling issue actually is, rather than allowing the Republicans to keep misinforming the public that it’s an increase in budget allocations rather than a payment for budget allocations already made?  This quirk in the law&#8211;the requirement that Congress authorize payment of costs already budgeted, already promised (e.g., in bond interest, Medicare payments, Social Security payments, veterans benefits)&#8211;is something that almost no member of the general public knows.</p>
<p> Obama keeps saying, in a single sentence, that he won’t allow default on money already appropriated and owing.  That’s nice.  But does he really not understand that this goes right over most people’s heads, because the Repubs keep telling them the opposite, and because the debt ceiling law is a technicality that most people simply don’t know about, and because that technicality has no counterpart in, say, normal living experience?</p>
<p>This is beginning to seem to me like the 2009-2010 ACA debate, redux&#8211;with the rightwing misinforming the public, and Obama thinking that the public knows specifics that the public flatly does not know.</p>
<p>So here’s a suggestion: Obama’s shown a fondness for adopting the Republicans’ messaging by analogizing the federal government to a family’s finances, even though this analogy, when it involves economic stimulus and other fiscal-appropriations issues, actually amounts to a misrepresentation of fact.  But on the debt ceiling matter, the government-is-similar-to-families analogy is exactly apt.  If someone already runs up large credit card bills, he owes the money even if he decides to rip up his credit cards and stop running up personal debt.  If he doesn’t pay the credit card bills he’s accrued, he’s DEFAULTING on those debts, and his credit rating will plunge.  And if someone owes monthly mortgage payments, he can’t simply stop paying them, and expect to keep his home.  He’ll lose the home in a foreclosure proceeding.</p>
<p>See? Not hard to explain.  But if Obama can’t or won’t explain this, some other Democrat who can garner the public’s attention should.  My suggestion: Bill Clinton.  And if Clinton won’t, then maybe Joe Biden can.</p>
<p>And after this success, maybe they can begin to torpedo the Republicans’ “Greece” canard by actually providing the public with facts.  Such as that Greece has a much smaller, less comprehensive social safety-net system than the U.S., than Germany, than Holland, than Canada, than Australia, than ….  It also has a deeply embedded culture of low rates of taxes, tax payments and tax collections.  Unlike Germany, Holland, Canada, Australia ….  </p>
<p>Which might suggest that McConnell didn’t know what he’s talking about when he said we didn’t have this problem because we weren’t taxing enough.  Especially since we didn’t have this problem when, say, during the Clinton years, we were.</p>
<p>That spending addiction of ours, of course, goes by the some familiar names.  Those names include Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid (including nursing home payments for incapacitated elderly who’ve exhausted their savings), and unemployment insurance.  They also include the Defense Department, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, air traffic controllers, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Centers for Disease Control, medical research grants, supplemental aid to states for education, the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the Agriculture Department (food safety), and farm price supports.  Not to mention “tax expenditures” to, say, ExxonMobil.</p>
<p>All of which the president should mention in his two big speeches this month: the inaugural speech and the State of the Union address.  Maybe then the Republicans will suggest what parts of our spending addiction they want us to confront, and how&#8211;exactly&#8211;they think we should confront them.  </p>
<p>Since, unlike Greece, we didn’t have this problem because we weren’t taxing enough. </p>

                                <p>There has been much discussion recently of the “problem” with Macroeconomics. See <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2013/01/my-simple-theory-about-why-macroeconomists-disagree.html">Nick Rowe</a>, <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/is-economics-divided-into-warring.html">Noah Smith</a> (who may have been punked by a self-selecting sample—or may not have), <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2013/01/bad-advice-from-experts-herding-and-bubbles.html">Mark Thoma</a>, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/01/more-on-the-current-state-of-macro.html">Brad DeLong</a>, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/thoughts-from-economics-writers-on.html">RDan’s collection here a while back</a>, and the rest of The Usual Suspects.<br />Let’s ignore for the moment that the problem with Macro is Micro.  I think I have figured out the <em>other</em> problem with Macro, and I have Victor Matheson to thank for it.</p>
<p>In the midst of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/12/dr-black-did-it-as-shorter-heres-data.html">a post last week</a>, I noted that there are perpetually claims from economists and that “chained CPI” is a “more accurate” measure of inflation. (Not coincidentally, Chained CPI runs below CPI.)  That not being enough I continued—in the calm, rational manner for which I am known (think a combination of Scipio Aemillianus and William Tecumseh Sherman)—by highlighting Professor Matheson’s otherwise rather innocuous comment chez DeLong that he remembered being told the same thing.</p>
<p>I gave Professor Matheson a “most notably,” when he was hardly the most extreme representative.  Indeed, anyone following the link to his comment would wonder why he was chosen.  It was mainly from this:<br />
<blockquote>While I teach intro to macro, I am not an expert in the minute details of the CPI calculations, and I do remember the talk in the 90s was that the CPI overestimates the true costs of inflation by something like a percentage point or two every year.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it is my misreading of that.  Note that, while Professor Matheson teaches Introduction to Macroeconomics (presumably Econ 301 or 302), he specifically <em>does not say that he teaches that CPI overestimates the true cost of inflation.</em><br /><em><br /></em> But he does say that he heard it in the 1990s, and does not say he has heard that those claims are bollocks.<br />Before going further, I want to apologize to Professor Matheson for making him the poster child and putting words into his mouth that his fingers didn’t actually type.  (And, in direct answer to his question chez DeLong, Nancy Ortiz in comments to the previous thread, lays out the biggest problems with “chained CPI” specifically as a measure for Social Security [or generally for anyone without legacy wealth].)</p>
<p>PJR, again in the previous comments thread, correctly sends us to the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/boskinrpt.html">Boskin Report</a>, and is not impressed:<br />
<blockquote>I conclude that the C-CPI probably answers the wrong question, consequently measures the wrong concept, and conflates inflation with behavioral responses to inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>To I trust no one’s great surprise, I consider that a generous interpretation.  Yet the myth persists.  Which is another reason we have a problem with Macro.</p>
<p>Chemists don’t teach <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory">Phlogiston Theory</a>. None of the biologists, biochemists, or biophysicists I know talks about the glories of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism">Lamarckism</a> when differentiating between 3’ and 5’ DNA.  But economists still pretend, as they did a decade ago <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2013/01/the-end-of-economists-imperialism.html">that Gary Becker proved that economics means that discrimination does not exist</a>; that Real Business Cycle Theory can actually explain any significant portion of Business Cycles in <em>either</em> direction; that NAIRU is a workable concept, even as “skill shortages” cause it to be severely discontinuous in a world that claims to have continuous functions (and does not work if it doesn’t).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>A world where CPI is a bad measure because people will choose dog food when they cannot afford Hamburger Helper (which we call “chicken-steak,” as if it were <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FctT-gzFaOw">Patrick Stewart and Steve Martin negotiating</a> [link will be understood by rjw’s students]) and that the IBM ThinkPads I bought three months ago costs about 1/10th what it did when it was new in 2001 (and I can probably sell it for&#8230;<em>bupkis</em>) means that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/04/1700-per-capita-per-year-in-consumer-surplus-from-personal-computers.html">“computing costs” have gone down for consumers</a>.</p>
<p>Not to mention a world of “rational expectations” (“micromotives,” as it were) being generalized so that networks, social interactions, cliques, and indeed governments are treated solely as if they are the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>The problem with Macro remains Micro, and the problem with my previous post remains that I was more than a bit unfair to Professor Matheson of Holy Cross, for which I apologize to him and our readers.<br />(Discussion of the paper referenced yesterday is deferred to another day.)</p>

<p>Some Thoughts on Statistical Analysis (A bit wonky)</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/01/assorted-links-664.html">Tyler Cowen</a>, a pretty good post on <a href="http://seanjtaylor.com/post/39573264781/the-statistics-software-signal">statistical analysis</a>.  While I suggest reading the post, I&#8217;ve reproduced the first sentence of each point the author makes below (though have cut out the pieces in betweeen):<br />
<blockquote>1. When you don’t have to code your own estimators, you<br />probably won’t understand what you’re doing&#8230;<br />2. When it’s extremely low cost to perform inference, you are likely<br />to perform a lot of inferences&#8230;<br />3. When operating software doesn’t require a lot of training, users of<br />that software are likely to be poorly trained&#8230;<br />4. When you use proprietary software, you are sending the message that<br />you don’t care about whether people can replicate your analyses or<br />verify that the code was correct.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think for the most part, this is a brilliant post, and it is worth keeping the main points in mind as they are very, very good.  That said, I tend to disagree slightly with a few points.  One is the author&#8217;s love of R, stated repeatedly in the pieces of the post I didn&#8217;t quote.    I find R to be a pain in the #$$.  So does the author, but he feels that is a virtue as per item 2 above.  Frankly, the older I get, the more I use (wait for it!) Excel to do statistical analysis.  Excel doesn&#8217;t do much in the way of sophisticated work, and what it does is clunky.  I&#8217;m guessing it would violate the author&#8217;s point 4, being proprietary, but I&#8217;ve checked enough results on Excel<br />using matrix algebra that I&#8217;m satisfied its basic regression functionality works.  If you want to do anything more sophisticated than a plain old OLS regression, you need to code it yourself in VBA.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But here&#8217;s what I love about using Excel&#8230;   Odds are, whatever data you&#8217;re using to do your analysis, you started off by sorting it in Excel in the first place. Its easy to sort and graph the data, and the eyeball and the nose are always the most important tools in statistics.  Another cool thing about Excel &#8211; it will spit out the<br />residuals.   And you can graph and organize those residuals twenty three ways from Sunday, which means you can build your own diagnostics appropriate for whatever task you&#8217;re doing.  Unless you absolutely positively have to run a system of equations fast, or you have a client who has glommed onto some absolutely useless statistical tool with a cool name (dig through an advanced econometrics book and you&#8217;ll spot &#8217;em aplenty) and you can&#8217;t shake them from their ignorance, there isn&#8217;t much point to using R or Stata or you name the program.  If your problem is not lack of time, but rather data sets that are too big for Excel to handle, find someone who is good in C++.</p>
<p>Another thing&#8230;  I suspect the author of that post and I have similar views on SAS. My own experience &#8211; I have seen or had associations with a number of organizations that consider themselves data savvy, and in<br />my opinion, from what I can tell,  if a company has X SAS licenses, it almost invariably means the organization has X junior analysts whose job it is to reach actionable conclusions using SAS who haven&#8217;t got<br />the vaguest clue how to interpret the results of the simplest statistical analysis.  This isn&#8217;t to say SAS is a bad tool, but merely that many organizations consider having a SAS license to be, in an of itself, a holy grail that allows them to dispense with any real expertise.</p>
<p>One final disagreement with the author &#8211; he seems to be falling into fallacy many economists do, which is assuming that what economists do is a science.  This to me indicates a failure to understand that a science is something scientists do, and what economists do is very different from what scientists do.   In biology, you won&#8217;t get very far if you try to peddle Lamarckian evolution, Lysenkoism or ID. Try being a proponent of the theory of phlogiston or the aether wind and see what that does for your career in physics.  But the equivalent<br />behavior in Economics won&#8217;t stop you, and may even prove beneficial to those wishing to get tenure at Harvard or Chicago, or be Dean of an Ivy League business school.  And then there are the think tanks&#8230;</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Steve Randy Waldman as usual <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/3630.html#comment-28383">gets practical</a> about Treasury issuing platinum coins. JKH in comments there does typically likewise.</p>
<p>Suppose the Department of the Treasury says:</p>
<p>“We have a statutory obligation to pay all amounts that have been authorized by Congress — both expenditure and debt obligations. Since the borrowing limit has been reached and Congress won’t let us sell bonds to make the payments they’ve authorized, we are now issuing physical currency, in the form of platinum coins, to meet those obligations. We are required to do this by statute.”</p>
<p>Let’s say the coins are worth $1 million each.</p>
<p>Treasury would have to issue about $100 billion in coins per month, which is about what it currently issues in bonds. The coins would be effectively the same as zero-interest, perpetual bonds.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter conceptually whether Treasury deposits that currency at their bank (the Fed) then pay bills normally using checks and wire transfers, or issues the coins to payees. Payees will deposit them at their banks, banks will deposit them in their accounts at the Fed, and the result is the same. The Fed has a bunch of platinum coins in its vault, and the government has met its obligations.</p>
<p>Ditto if Treasury sells the coins to primary dealers/banks/sovereign-wealth funds:</p>
<p>1. A transfer of Fed reserves/deposits from dealers/bankers to Treasury. Treasury has money to  spend.</p>
<p>2. Dealers/bankers deposit their coins at the Fed.</p>
<p>3. The Fed issues reserves to dealers/bankers in return.</p>
<p><strong>But:</strong> Suppose the Fed starts feeling inflation looming. So it sells bonds and receives bank deposits (reserves) in return, to sop up excess money/reserves. This is called “sterilizing” the platinum money creation. (We’ll ignore for the moment the fact that the sold bonds may/will just get repoed in the private market in return for cash.)</p>
<p>But the Fed’s only got about $3 trillion in bonds to sell. What happens when it runs out? Can it still control inflation?</p>
<p>(At that point, monetary policy is effectively managed by congress’s taxing and spending decisions. Budget deficit = easing. Budget surplus = tightening. That is not a promising prospect.)</p>
<p>The Fed could start selling its platinum coins, draining reserves/”money” out of the system. (Assuming those coins aren’t used for exchange, but are held in vaults just like other “reserves”/stores of value.)</p>
<p>But why would dealers buy them?</p>
<p>The answer seems to be negative interest on reserves (IOR). If the Fed charged .25% (or whatever) to hold banks’ money for them (negative quarter point of interest), banks/dealers/sovereign-wealth funds would have an incentive to trade those reserves for platinum coins (at 0% interest) to hold in their vaults.</p>
<p>Would (negative) IOR be a sufficiently effective monetary instrument for the Fed to manage monetary policy? Other implications?</p>

                                <p>With all the well-deserved attention going to Kevin Drum’s excellent <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline">Mother Jones article on crime rates and lead in gasoline</a> (more <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/01/lead-and-crime-correction">here</a>), I thought it worth revisiting my post on the subject from a year and a half ago, which was itself prompted by Angry Bear’s own inimitable <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/get-lead-out-ii.html">Robert Waldmann</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/government-gets-the-lead-out-crime-plummets.html">Government Gets the Lead Out, Crime Plummets</a></p>
<p>In which I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re seeing it in spades: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead#History">history of tetraethyl lead</a> (read it and weep) is a tragic textbook case of market/profit interests eviscerating the commons and making us all (including the rich) far worse off, in the name of “the invisible hand” making us all better off.</p>
<p>That ebil gubmint man with his heavy-handed regulations impinging on honest businesspeople (who are just trying to make a buck, for everyone’s benefit) sure did have a pernicious effect, huh?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can only imagine how many <em>trillions</em> of dollars that lead-driven crime wave has cost our country, and how many tens of millions of lives that lead poisoning has destroyed.</p>
<p>But don’t worry: you can rely on profit-making companies to “allocate our resources most efficiently.” Trust me on this.</p>

<p> CBO: SS Scheduled vs Payable Benefits (Rosser&#8217;s Equation illustrated)</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9bLHAYFroVQ/UN_ZjJm-YwI/AAAAAAAAAGc/2k_zd3cc_5c/s1600/2012+CBO+Ex+9+(Rosser's+Equation).tiff"><img border="0" height="228" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9bLHAYFroVQ/UN_ZjJm-YwI/AAAAAAAAAGc/2k_zd3cc_5c/s1600/2012+CBO+Ex+9+(Rosser's+Equation).tiff" width="320"></a></p>
<p>&#8216;Rosser&#8217;s Equation&#8217; is something between an in-joke and tribute to Prof. Barkley Rosser, Jr of JMU, an economist friend of mine who pointed out a surprising result: real payable benefits after projected Trust Fund depletion and subsequent 25% cut will still be higher in actual basket of goods terms than those of current retirees. This is because the scheduled benefit formula delivers something like 160% of the current benefit and as Prof Rosser pointed out to me long ago 75% of 160%=120%.   </p>
<p>The above Exhibit 9 from CBO&#8217;s 2012 Long Term Projections for Social Security resolves Rosser&#8217;s equation for selected demographic cohorts and income quintiles. And the results show that the retiree born in 1947 who reached FRA (Full Retirement Age) in 2012 would see an initial benefit ranging from $10k to $25k and representing 100% of the schedule. On the other hand the retiree born in 1970 and who will reach FRA at age 67 in 2037, that is after TF Depletion would see initial benefits in 2012 dollars ranging from $12k to $33k.    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Now there is no doubt that an overnight 25% cut in benefits at Trust Fund Depletion would represent huge sticker shock for then retirees. And there are very good reasons based in societal equity for scheduled benefits to rise at the real rate the formula delivers. As such we should make every effort to find ways of closing the gap between payable and scheduled from the bottom up rather than forcing scheduled down simply to avoid the shock of of cut. Because the risk is that the &#8216;cure&#8217; might deliver a worse result in real terms than the &#8216;crisis&#8217; left unaddressed.    </p>
<p>Which is why I have been maintaining for years that &#8216;Nothing&#8217; IS a Plan. Not as good a plan as it was when Prof Rosser and I started corresponding five plus years ago, circumstances have changed. Still it represents the &#8220;First Do No Harm&#8221; alternative, after all a check in 2040 20% better in real terms than an equivalently situated retiree gets today doesn&#8217;t exactly meet the definition of existential crisis for Social Security. </p>

<blockquote><p>“cutting unemployment insurance would increase employment, as it would end payments for people who fail to find work and would reduce the cushion provided after layoffs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w18668">Here’s one</a> pretty well-done data point (several, actually) suggesting that he’s wrong:</p>
<blockquote><p>In theory, greater employment protection should dampen the effects of output movements on employment and therefore reduce the Okun coefficient. In Figure 10 (right panel), we test this idea by plotting the coefficient against the OECD’s overall EPL index (averaged over 1985-2008, the period for which it is available). The relationship has the wrong sign, and it is statistically insignificant.[9]</p>
<p>[9] For New Zealand, the EPL index is available over 1990-2008. We also find no relationship between the Okun coefficient and the various components of the EPL index.</p>
