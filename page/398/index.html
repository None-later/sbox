<p>Norman Borlaug, Michael Jackson, and the Invisible Hand</p>
<p>When Adam Smith described the concept of laissez-faire capitalism, he argued that it was not just efficient but moral.  As long as everyone acted in their own self-interest and the government did not interfere, the Invisible Hand would guide market forces toward the best possible outcome for society.  Its generally accepted that this doesn&#8217;t always work in the presence of externalities; someone (i.e., government) has to be there to ensure that people don&#8217;t exercise their right to swing their fist beyond the start of other people&#8217;s noses.  </p>
<p>But there is another problem which seems to be less highly recognized, namely that the whole concept of the Invisible Hand itself is bull$#^&#038;.  As an example, I&#8217;m writing this a few minutes after reading about the death of Norman Borlaug.  He was a Nobel Laureate who developed disease-resistant and fast growing crops.  Depending on who you ask, his work saved the lives of somewhere between a quarter of a billion and a billion people.  So far.  If we don&#8217;t all die in some sort of cataclysm in the next fifteen minutes, that number will only grow.  </p>
<p>Now consider another person recently deceased &#8211; Michael Jackson.  I believe Jackson was finally buried some time last week.  Aside from being known the world over, Jackson was very wealthy, despite his clear incompetence with money.  He probably made at least one dollar for every life saved by Norman Borlaug, so far.  Norman Borlaug, on the other hand, to the best of my knowledge, did not.  Furthermore, this discrepancy in income is very, very, very hard to attribute to government interference.  </p>
<p>Which means, there are two possible alternatives:</p>
<p>1.  Michael Jackson did more positive things for the world than Norman Borlaug.  <br />2.  Michael Jackson did less positive things for the world than Norman Borlaug. </p>
<p>There is no third option.  None.  Now, I think very, very few people, even die-hard Michael Jackson fans, when presented with numbers like &#8220;a quarter of a billion lives saved so far&#8221; would agree with option 1.  Which leaves option 2.  And if option 2, then the Invisible Hand is bull$#^&#038;.  Which means capitalism doesn&#8217;t work or is immoral.  That does not imply any other philosophical system would work better, mind you, but trusting the market to do its thing provides perverse results. <br />_______________________________________<br />by cactus</p>
<p>UPDATE by Ken:</p>
<p>I mentioned this in comments, but I think it&#8217;s worth embedding here, too, as context for Norman Borlaug:

<blockquote>The Court observes that the President defeated seven opponents in a grueling campaign for his party’s nomination that lasted more than eighteen months and cost those opponents well over $300 million. Then the President faced a formidable opponent in the general election who received $84 million to conduct his general election campaign against the President.</p>
<p>It would appear that ample opportunity existed for discovery of evidence that would support any contention that the President was not eligible for the office he sought. To press her &#8220;birther agenda,&#8221; Plaintiff’s counsel has filed the present action on behalf of Captain Rhodes&#8230;.</p>
<p>The American taxpayers paid for her third and fourth years of medical school and financially supported her during her subsequent medical internship and residency program. In exchange for this valuable free medical education, Captain Rhodes agreed to serve two years in active service in the Army. She began that term of active service in July of 2008 and had no concerns about fulfilling her military obligation until she received orders notifying her that she would be deployed to Iraq in September of 2009.</p>
<p>Captain Rhodes does not seek a discharge from the Army; nor does she wish to be relieved entirely from her two year active service obligation. She has not previously made any official complaints regarding any orders or assignments that she has received, including orders that have been issued since President Obama became Commander in Chief. But she does not want to go to Iraq (or to any other destination where she may be in harm’s way, for that matter). Her &#8220;conscientious objections&#8221; to serving under the current Commander in Chief apparently can be accommodated as long as she is permitted to remain on American soil.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even with an individual mandate which comes with a substantial fine for non-compliance 6% of the legal non-elderly population end up still uninsured and a total of 25 million uninsured total, most of whom would be legal. And people above 300% of poverty getting no help at all.</p>
<p>Change we can count on? Sheesh.</p>

<p>There is always an agenda when a central banker declares the recession is over &#8211; and <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/events/2009/0915_financial_crisis.aspx">Bernanke is no different</a>. The following facts remain: US GDP contracted at a 1% annualized pace in the second quarter of 2009 (its fourth consecutive drop), industrial output grew just two consecutive months after declining every month (except one) since January 2008, employment is still falling, retail sales are improving somewhat, and real personal income has formed no discernible upward trend.</p>
<p>In that light, the most accurate description of Bernanke&#8217;s declaration is that he &#8220;thinks&#8221; the recession is over, rather than it &#8220;is&#8221; over. His strategic announcement plays on market expectations to the upside, just as announcing that the recession is underway would play on expectations to the downside.</p>
<p>Are central bankers generally more apt to declare the end of a recession sooner that the beginning? I bet that they are. Will an AB reader do a little investigative reporting to find the first time that Bernanke acknowledged the onset of the 07-09 recession? My money&#8217;s on 12/08, the date when the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/dec2008.html">NBER declared it as such</a> and a year after it began.</p>
<p>To his credit, much of Bernanke&#8217;s <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/events/2009/0915_financial_crisis.aspx">Brookings address</a> was spent highlighting the weak recovery that is expected. Bernanke is brilliant and surrounds himself with likewise brilliant economists &#8211; but data is data; and he sees what I see, which is a murky bottom and expected positive growth.</p>
<p>The charts below illustrate the key monthly macroeconomic variables used by the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">National Bureau of Economic Research</a> to date the recession peak and trough by month: <a href="http://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/pi/pinewsrelease.htm">real income</a> (I use personal income through July), <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.toc.htm">employment</a> (through August), <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/">industrial production </a>(through August), and wholesale-<a href="http://www.census.gov/retail/">retail sales</a> (through August). </p>

<p>George Cooper is on to something in his book &#8220;The Origin of Financial Crises&#8221; (highly recommended). He criticizes central banking for adhering to efficient markets thinking, which leads to lax policy on the upside of the business cycle, i.e., allowing aggregate demand to outpace underlying fundamentals, and overly aggressive policy on the way down.</p>
<p>In this light, central bankers might be quicker to face the end of the recession and slower to conclude the onset of one. It is akin to policy mistakes being made on the way up and a triumph on the way down.</p>

<blockquote>Government bureaucrats don&#8217;t reduce costs.  Market competition reduces costs.  The challenge for health care reform is to get the market competition into the places where we want it &#8212; providers and insurers competing to deliver better services at lower prices &#8212; and out of the places where we don&#8217;t want it &#8212; insurers competing to insure only the lowest risks and providers gaming the government reimbursement systems to earn the highest profits.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Government might possibly keep [one] safe and therefore the billions wasted are money well-spent. [One] graciously permits the government to police [one&#8217;s] bar-hopping, repair the roads [one] drives on, clean [one&#8217;s] water and deliver it to [one&#8217;s] door, remove [one&#8217;s] bodily waste, treat it, and release it far from [one&#8217;s] view.</p>
<p>The government hauls away [one&#8217;s] garbage, keeps [one&#8217;s] lights on, pumps natural gas into [one&#8217;s] water heater, <em>for far less money than it would cost if [one] had to do it on [one&#8217;s] own</em>.

<p>For the last two months much of the talk around Health Care Reform has been about the Gang of Six of the Senate Finance Commitee to the point that some people think the Gang and the Committee are one and the same. But this is not true at all, this week Chairman Baucus will release the Chairman&#8217;s Mark, shaped as it is by contributions from other members of the Gang, and will be faced with getting it through the full Finance Committee, itself largely shut out from the process to date. So for at least the moment the math changes, instead of crafting a bill that could potentially get 60 votes in the full Senate, Baucus is now face with pushing a bill out of the Committee with majority support, which in this case means 12 of 23 votes. The following names are in Committee seniority order with members of the Sub-Committee on Health Care marked with an &#8216;H&#8217; and members of the Gang of Six marked with a &#8216;G&#8217;</p>
<p>Democrats<br />MAX BAUCUS, MT (G)<br />JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, WV (H-Sub-Committee Chair)<br />KENT CONRAD, ND (G)<br />JEFF BINGAMAN, NM (G) (H)<br />JOHN F. KERRY, MA (H)<br />BLANCHE L. LINCOLN, AR (H)<br />RON WYDEN, OR (H)<br />CHARLES E. SCHUMER, NY (H)<br />DEBBIE STABENOW, MI (H)<br />MARIA CANTWELL, WA (H)<br />BILL NELSON, FL (H)<br />ROBERT MENENDEZ, NJ (H)<br />THOMAS CARPER, DE (H)</p>
<p>Republicans<br />CHUCK GRASSLEY, IA (G)<br />ORRIN G. HATCH, UT (H-Ranking Member)<br />OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, ME (G) (H)<br />JON KYL, AZ (H)<br />JIM BUNNING, KY (H)<br />MIKE CRAPO, ID (H)<br />PAT ROBERTS, KS <br />JOHN ENSIGN, NV (H)<br />MIKE ENZI, WY (G) (H)<br />JOHN CORNYN, TX  (H)</p>
<p>First thing to note is that Health is a big Sub-Committee that includes all but four members of the full Committee which might explain why Baucus chose to take it to a smaller group. But inspection of the list shows a curious thing, the Gang of Six managed to include three out of the four members who are NOT on the Finance Health Sub-Committee and so would include those people not committed enough to Health Care to even request a seat.</p>
<p>Second thing is that while Sub-Committee Ranking Member Hatch was originally included in what was then a Gang of Seven, he dropped out early, and Sub-Committee Chair Jay Rockefeller, the person you would expect a priori to have the biggest interest in this topic, was frozen out altogether. Nor did the Gang respect seniority, as noted it jumped over the number two Democrat on the full Committee roster in Rockefeller but also dipped deep on the Republican bench to pick up Enzi.</p>
<p>Third is the arithmetic. In order to get marked up legislation out of Committee Chairman Baucus needs twelve of twenty-three votes. We know from news reports that he has no support from nine Republicans, although he continues negotiation with the Gang of Six both Grassley and Enzi are on record that they will not vote for the final version. Which means that even if he retains the support of remaining Republican Gang member Snowe he needs the support of ten of the remaining Democrats to get to the magic number of twelve to achieve a majority. Without Snowe he can only afford to lose a single Democrat. Which at this point means the side-lined Chair of the Finance Subcommittee who the New Republic reports came out firmly against the Baucus Plan on Tuesday afternoon <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-treatment/breaking-rockefeller-says-no-way-support-baucus-bill-present-form">Breaking: Rockefeller Says &#8220;No Way&#8221; on Baucus Framework</a><br />
<blockquote>I have sat besides Max Baucus for 22 years on the Finance Committee. &#8230; I&#8217;m probably one of his best friend among Democrats. But I cannot agree with him on this bill. &#8230; There is no way in present form I will vote for it. Therefore, I will not vote for it unless it changes during the amendment process by vast amounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conventional wisdom was that the bill that would supply the framework for the bill on the Senate floor was going to be that of the Finance Committee and that moreover that bill would be fundamentally the work product of Baucus&#8217;s Gang of Six. But while Baucus asserts that the work of the Gang will continue, the fate of the bill over the next week will be determined by who can get twelve votes.</p>
<p>In a battle between full Committee Chair Baucus and Health Sub-Committee Chair Rockefeller who holds the strongest hand? We&#8217;ll see. But Rockefeller only needs to hold Kerry and Wyden to keep Baucus from an outright win, and one would think at a minimum he can hold Schumer and Stabenow, each of whom&#8217;s states look to be big winners from near universal health care.</p>
<p>My inbox tells me the Baucus Plan was just released so I expect to be back with some links and discussion. In the meanwhile: any early thoughts?</p>
<p>(Update one) SWEET. The NYT has the PDF of the Chairman&#8217;s mark in a navigable form on their site.<br />http://documents.nytimes.com/baucus-proposal-to-overhaul-health-care#p=1</p>

<p>Industrial output rose 0.8 percent in August, following an upwardly revised increase of 1.0 percent in July. Production in manufacturing expanded 0.6 percent in August, and the index excluding motor vehicles and parts increased 0.4 percent. The gain in July for manufacturing was revised up 0.4 percentage point, to1.4 percent; in addition, factory output for April through June is now somewhat less weak than reportedpreviously.</p>
<p>Compared to other cycles the first two months rebound appears normal, neither weak nor strong.</p>

Of course, the US no longer has the<br />capacity to build that many cars and trucks.</p>
<p>With hours worked in manufacturing unchanged last month this implies that the recently reported surge in manufacturing productivity is continuing.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I am not questioning Senator Olympia Snowe&#8217;s integrity.  The Snowe job in question was my attempt to convince myself that Senator Snowe agrees with me.  When reflecting on the question I discover that she strongly disagrees with Senator Snowe.  I can see that the problem of health care reform has caused her to struggle intellecutally, but I don&#8217;t know if she is wrestling desperately or Grassling* brilliantly.</p>
<p>thoughts after the jump.</p>
<p>OK first the Snowe job.  <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/58929-democrats-to-go-it-alone">Snowe has two objections to the Baucus proposal</a> (<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_09/019962.php">via Steve Benen</a>) .  One is that financing subsidies by taxing expensive insurance policies will hurt Maine, since insurance premia are high in Maine (note it takes a sort of inverted political genius to insist on a financing mechanism which is bad for Maine).  The second is that the subsidies are too stingy.  On the second point Snowe agrees with most Democrats who are not Baucus.  The 3 other plans have more generous subsidies.</p>
<p>So, I thought, maybe she supports a bill with more generous subsidies and a different financing mechanism.  The alternative which has been discussed is a tax on rich people.  Maybe she supports the House Energy and Commerce Committee bill.</p>
<p>But she worries about the total gross spending increases (generally called &#8220;costs&#8221; in the press).  Hmm well they could be cut if there were a public option so maybe &#8230;</p>
<p>Then I realised that I was dreaming.  She has also asked for the public option to be taken off the table.  </p>
<p>The costs are the costs of subsidies and medicaid expansion.  Snowe has said the subsidies and medicaid expansion are too stingy and that the costs are too high.  Her implied proposal is not just impractical, it violates arithmetic.  She has definitely and specifically called the exact same outlays too large and too small.  </p>
<p>Given the definition of &#8220;costs&#8221; they can&#8217;t be reduced by cutting spending except for spending on subsidies and medicaid expansion.  &#8220;Costs&#8221; are the sum of spending increases not spending increases minus spending cuts.  I determine the definition of this strange new technical term from the fact that the reduction of medicare advantage giveaways to insurance companies doesn&#8217;t reduce &#8220;costs.&#8221; </p>
<p>On financing, the fact that she opposes the tax on expensive insurance doesn&#8217;t mean that she supports a tax on the rich, any other tax increase or more deficit spending.   </p>
<p>It almost looks as if she is deliberately imposing conditions each of which sounds good to the uninformed, but which can&#8217;t all be satisfied because they are logically inconsistent.  I still Snowe myself into thinking she is honestly struggling, but honestly, it&#8217;s beginning to be a struggle.</p>
<p>*To Grassle<br />Verb.  To sabotage negotiations by demanding secrecy, privately promising that one is close to saying yes, publicly promise nothing and constantly make new objections each of which seems to require concessions which aren&#8217;t extreme enough to be deal breakers.</p>
<p>This is a very common diplomatic technique.  I don&#8217;t want to violate al Goodwin&#8217;s law, but one extreme case was Saddam Hussein in 1991.  One international statesman after another communicated the demand that he take his army out of Kuwait.  Each emerged smiling assuring the world that they were close to a diplomatic solution, but not quite there yet.</p>
<p>Generally one does not hope to block and delay *and* win concessions even after it becomes clear that one will never say yes.  The current Baucus plan makes me wonder how the world would have reacted if Bush Sr had driven the Iraqi army out of Kuwait and then forced the Kuwaiti&#8217;s to stop pumping so much oil from oil fields which straddled the Iraq Kuwait border.</p>
<p>The point of Grassling is to take a lot of time.  People who waste time debaiting the details of a proposal that they want to block (that is filibuster intelligentl) can be said to act grassly the adverb that corresponds to the verb to Grassle.  They congressman who shouted &#8220;you lie&#8221; acted crassly but not grassly.</p>

<p>“Great Benefit is like a Giant Slot Machine that never pays off”. The RainMaker, John Grisham</p>
<p>Private Healthcare Insurance companies paid off for those from whom they can profit. The rest of us who are costly because of age, disorders, or illness are bound to find ourselves without private insurance and too young or high in income for government insurance. Private healthcare insurance is not insurance, it is speculation, a gamble upon your health and the returns from your premium. Those who have healthcare insurance are those insured by the government.</p>
<p>“This builds into another favorite Grisham premise &#8212; that the idea that the courts are jammed with nuisance lawsuits is backward. Average people haven&#8217;t a clue as to their rights because the law has become as removed and alien as another planet, Grisham suggests.” <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/04/13/DD22445.DTL">“Grisham Is Back In Court”</a></p>
<p>The push to reform medical malpractice laws focuses on lawsuits being the cause for higher insurance costs for doctors, driving doctors out of practice, and as a major contributor to overall healthcare cost. In the past, I have answered on the question of medical malpractice lawsuits and the impact on healthcare costs. Not having a degree in law, I can not answer for the legality of lawsuits; but, I can continue to point out the insignificance of medical malpractice lawsuit cost on the overall healthcare cost. I will add, it would make sense to modify medical malpractice law if people did not have to pay out $thousands to care for themselves or someone else who has suffered temporary or permanent debilitating injury as a result of a doctor, hospital, corporation, or medical practice’s negligence. If universal healthcare were in place, the need for a major component of malpractice law suits, awards for hospitalization or nursing care, could potentially be nullified. Today without such a plan in place, it is inconceivable to eliminate the only manner in which an individual can recoup expenses from a hospital, a corporation, or a doctor’s practice/business when nothing exists to take care of the victim. </p>
<p>In 2004 Bush claimed; &#8220;The health care system looks like a giant lottery. That is what it looks like these days with these lawsuits and somehow the trial lawyers are always holding the winning ticket.&#8221; Again in 2006 President Bush cited Medical Malpractice Lawsuits as the biggest issue driving doctors out of business; however, the numbers of physicians are rising at a ratio faster than the population and at the same time as profits for malpractice insurance companies. 15 malpractice insurers in Florida had profits increase by ~$800 million in 2005. While insurance premiums may be rising for doctors and profits are rising for insurance companies, the numbers of malpractice suits resulting in payment have been declining. From 2001 to 2005, the numbers of payments decreased from 16,588 to 14,033 and are reflected in payments/awards per 100,000 made on behalf of doctors going from 5.82 to 4.73. When adjusted for inflation, total malpractice payments over the 14 years have gone from $2.11 billion in 1991 to $2.14 billion in 2005 or an increase of ½ of 1%.   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/NPDB%20Report_Final.pdf">“The Medical Tort Reform Debate”</a> Public Citizen 2007</p>
<p>In the seventies, Tom Baker (Univ. of PA Prof. of Law and Health Sciences) recalled similar issues being discussed by his father around the dinner table accusing medical malpractice lawsuits of driving up the cost of healthcare, insurance premiums, and driving doctors out of business. In the mid 1970s, the California Hospital and Medical Associations sponsored a study on the “exploding” frequency of medical malpractice suits. The investigation found thousands of people injured by malpractice; but, few of the injured actually sued. The study was never brought to the forefront in California until the passage of restrictive malpractice lawsuit reforms in California. The study then emerged from the background it was placed in and published in an association report and failed to get the public acknowledgement it deserved. </p>
<p>Since the seventies, the topic of malpractice lawsuits surfaced again in the eighties, at the turn of the century, and again now. Other studies since the seventies California study have confirmed what was found then in California in the seventies: too much medical malpractice with little malpractice litigation; the actual costs of medical malpractice having little to do with the litigation; medical malpractice insurance premiums being cyclical and having little to do with litigation or runaway juries; and many undeserving malpractice suits being brought forth because people can not find out what happened. What can be counted on is continued pressure to draw the attention away from the ~100,000 cases of malpractice yearly and rising insurance premiums until such time as premiums decline for doctors. Little if nothing has been done to lower the incidence of malpractice by doctors, which are mostly mistakes. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/036480.html">“The Medical Malpractice Myth,”</a> Tom Baker.</p>
<p>August 2009, “<a href="http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/would-tort-reform-lower-health-care-costs/">Would Tort Reform Lower Healthcare Costs?</a>” Tom Baker answers questions in the NYT Health Section. Tom Baker made the following observation on medical malpractice reform:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Because it’s (tort reform) a red herring. It’s become a talking point for those who want to obstruct change. But [tort reform] doesn’t accomplish the goal of bringing down costs.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It is claimed the vast number of malpractice lawsuits drive up healthcare costs at a rate of 10 &#8211; 15% per year. The reality with malpractice suits is an increase in the cost of healthcare of ~1.5% or ~ $31 billion (2007) against a $2 trillion healthcare economy. What is driving up the cost of healthcare and healthcare insurance are overhead and administrative costs, an aging population, chronic illness, a growing population of people with poor life style habits, fragmentation of the industry, technological advances, poor planning, and the wealth of the populace who have more disposable income.</p>
<p>Comments on how doctors are practicing increased defensive medicine because of potentially being sued are not as true as some would have us believe. What has been found are doctors practicing medicine consistent within the standards and practices of the region in which the doctors are located. A 1996 Florida study did find a potential 5-7% increase in costs as a result of Florida’s doctors practicing defense healthcare with regard to heart disease. After a few years, the same authors rechecked the percentages and found the potential cost increases dropped to 2.5 – 3.5% with this drop coming about after managed healthcare came into being. </p>
<p>As are the plaintiffs bringing medical malpractice lawsuits, lawsuits are an easy target to vilify. It gives most people and critics vision of $millions in “sugar plums” being unjustly awarded for little or no reason. Medical malpractice lawsuits are the poster child for the rising costs of healthcare and insurance even when they have little impact. In any case, the elimination of malpractice suits will do little to slow the rising cost of healthcare or insurance and as Prof Baker points out a “red herring used to obstruct change.” Many states already have caps on malpractice awards ranging from $250,000 to $500,000 for pain and suffering and these caps do not index for inflation. The visions of $millions being recouped do not exist for most plaintiffs. </p>
<p>In the period of 1991 – 2005 82% of malpractice rewards went to injuries such as death (~32%), significant permanent injury (~19%), major permanent injury (~19%), and quadriplegic, brain, and lifelong care (~13%). The average medical malpractice award in 1991 was ~$281,000 and grew to ~$486,000 in 2005. When adjusted for inflation, the average for 2005 decreases to ~$260,000 or a decrease of ~8% in the size of malpractice awards when compared to 1991. The false premise of being awarded $millions typically does not happen. ~2.4% of payments in 2005 were > $1 million and ½ of 1% were > $1 million over the 1991-2005 period. A botched nose job causing emotional injury was </p>

<p>Michael Mandel at Businessweek had a post on the subject of where are health care costs rising the fastest.</p>
<p>http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2009/09/where_are_healt.htm</p>
<p>In the post he posted this table and used it as the basis for making comparisons of the growth of health care spending in various countries.</p>
<p><img alt="healthiness_3584_image001.gif" src="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/healthiness_3584_image001.gif" height="615" width="491"></p>
<p>But the analysis is flawed.  Note it is in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).</p>
<p>If you calculate a country&#8217;s growth in medical spending from this the results are meaningless.</p>
<p>Take Korea for example.  The table shows that health care spending  rose 9.6%.  But this rise could stems from several different causes.  It might be because domestic spending on health care rose 9.6% and the exchange rate used to calculate the PPP terms  was unchanged.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it could mean that spending in the domestic currency was unchanged and the exchange rate used to calculate it in PPP terms changed by 9.6%.</p>
<p>Because of this these growth rate comparisons are meaningless.</p>
<p>It may be a valid exercise to use PPP terms to compare the level of spending on health care between two countries.  But you can not use it to calculate meaningful comparisons of the growth in health care spending in different countries.</p>
<p>This posting by Mandel is being cited by numerous blogs yesterday and today and they are all making this same fundamental error.</p>
