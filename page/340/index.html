<p>By Marshall Auerback</p>
<p>My colleague, Rebecca Wilder, recently concluded a <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/02/tale-of-two-recoveries-malaysia-vs.html">&#8220;Tale of Two Recoveries: Malaysia vs Germany</a><a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/02/tale-of-two-recoveries-malaysia-vs.html">&#8220;</a> which brought back memories of my own time in the Far East and some of the advisory work I did for the government of Malaysia during the financial crisis of 1997/98.</p>
<p>Before the historical revisionists get hold of this period, it is important to note that Malaysia’s initial response to the crisis was a textbook illustration of how to exacerbate, not alleviate, a financial crisis. Of course, it was a consequence of taking stupid and economically ruinous advice from the International Monetary Fund, which is to economic development what John Meriwether is to asset management. If anybody had any doubts, those of us who observed the crisis first hand realized that the IMF and the so-called <a href="http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19990215,00.html">“Committee to Save the World”</a> were more interested in saving the first-world banks who were exposed than caring about the local citizens who were scorched by harsh austerity programs. Same old, same old.<br />It was only when the Deputy PM/Finance Minister was ousted from the Cabinet and his pro-IMF policies completely repudiated, that Malaysia’s economy began its long road back to successful recovery.</p>
<p>There is little question that former PM Mahathir Mohammed was a political thug, but not an economic illiterate. But his sacking of Anwar from the Cabinet and decision to press ludicrous sodomy and abuse of power charges against his former heir apparent foolishly undermined his economic legacy. It is certainly wrong, however, to criticise his response to the Asian financial crisis of 1997/98. Vindicated now with the benefit of hindsight, at the time his embrace of exchange controls, and a 180-degree reversal away from the policies of austerity advocated by the Fund, were viewed as dangerously anti-free market, destined to render Malaysia an investment pariah.</p>
<p>Before the temporary triumph of the so-called “Washington consensus” school of economics in the late 1990s, the so-called “interventionist” East Asian alliance model of capitalism was highly lauded by institutions such as the World Bank and even the IMF itself. A common thread characterizing the economic development of countries such as Thailand, Korea, Singapore, and, yes, Malaysia, were policies which transferred resources away from “unproductive” toward “productive” uses—often in the form of transfers from unproductive groups to productive groups and sometimes in the form of policies to convert unproductive groups into productive ones. Creating “rents” (above normal market returns) by “distorting” markets through industrial policies was essential, first, to induce more-than-free-market investment in activities that the government deemed important for the economy’s transformation, and second, to sustain a political coalition in support of these policies. Disciplining rent-seeking so that it remained consistent with these two objectives was also essential.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />It was precisely this model that came under such sustained attack during the late 1990s. Then Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin, his Deputy, Lawrence Summers, and their lieutenants saw the crisis as the perfect opportunity to destroy this model once and for all, and to do this, they wanted the International Monetary Fund to impose conditions on the economies of emerging Asia that went far beyond the Fund’s traditional boundaries. Thus the U.S. Treasury kept steady pressure on Fund officials to extract more and more concessions from South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia including instant resolution of all trade related issues in favor of the United States. The exasperated Asians were soon accusing the IMF of always raising new issues at the behest of the United States—something that the Fund officials readily acknowledged later.</p>
<p>Foremost in the minds of Treasury officials was also the interest of Wall Street, especially American financial services firms. These biases were manifested in the types of IMF conditions imposed on the emerging Asian economies during the height of the crisis, which clearly served the brokerage firms on Wall Street far better than the needs of emerging Asia.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s the economies at the core of the world economy (the U.S., “Euroland,” Japan), began to generate hugely excessive liquidity. In the early 1990s, mutual funds, pension funds, other institutional investors, hedge funds and—last but not least—banks became awash with deposits. They scoured the world for high returns. Investment houses like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley sought the business of arranging the privatizations, securities placements, mergers, and acquisitions that surged on the wave of liquidity—business that became their main growth area. As a consequence, financial capital poured in to “emerging markets” (middle-income countries of recent interest to institutional investors).</p>
<p>Capital flows to developing nations in Asia and Latin America jumped from about $50bn a year before the end of the Cold War to about $300bn a year by the mid-1990s. From 1992-96, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines were all experiencing money and credit growth rates of between 25-30 per cent a year. Emerging market stock markets boomed, nearly doubling their share of world capitalization between 1990 and 1993.</p>
<p>Proponents of capital liberalization justified these inflows on the grounds of (a) maximizing the efficiency of capital worldwide, (b) allowing a specific country to invest more than could be financed from its own savings, (c) bringing modern financial institutions into the country, and (d) deepening the liquidity of the country’s financial system and lengthening investor horizons, thereby making markets more efficient and more stable. In the end the case for free capital flows came down to the classic theory of comparative advantage, as though trade in dollars was essentially similar to trade in widgets.</p>
<p>In reality, however, the funds went into increasingly marginal and speculative developments and simply exacerbated an underlying credit bubble. Although they did not speak out at the time, a number of prominent economists and financiers have since pointed out the dangers of such “gypsy capital”. Joseph Stiglitz, for example, argued that the origins of the Asian financial crisis rested, in the first place, with the excessively rapid financial and capital market liberalization that the U.S. Treasury had pushed on these economies, on behalf of Wall Street, and over the protests of the Council of Economic Advisors, of which he was the chairman. “At the Council of Economic Advisors we weren’t convinced that South Korean liberalization was a matter of U.S. national interest, though obviously it would help the special interests of Wall Street” (Globalization and Its Discontents, New York: W. W. Norton, 2002, p. 102).</p>
<p>Similarly, Jagdish Bhagwati, one of free trade’s most passionate supporters for developing nations, argued that the idea of free trade had been “hijacked by the proponents of capital mobility”.</p>
<p>The end result of this drive to liberalise capital accounts in immature emerging economies was a series of booms and busts, culminating in financial crisis. Capital flows into emerging markets turn out to be less a diversification of assets, more another instance of “investment herding”, especially within regions, where market allocation was propelled less by differences between countries in their “fundamentals” (including “good” or “bad” policy) than by “push factors”—macro push factors like the amount of excess liquidity in different parts of the core zone of the world economy; and micro push factors like the incentives on institutional money managers and the corresponding drive to match the “benchmark weightings” devised by pension fund consultants, many of knew nothing of the various underlying markets. Money managers tend to be evaluated relative to the median performance of money managers in the same asset class. This encourages them to move in and out of markets together, producing “herding” or “trend chasing” or “positive feedback trading” and the crisis of 1997/98 was a textbook illustration of that phenomenon.</p>
<p>Malaysia was heading down this road in 1997. The currency, the ringgit, was collapsing, as the contagion effects from Thailand, Korea and Indonesia gradually extended into the country. Although Anwar had not placed the country under a formal imf program, he had been following the imf recipe: to forestall capital flight, fiscal policy was tightened and interest rates were hiked in order to protect the external value of the currency.</p>
<p>Based largely on their experience in Latin America, the Fund had already imposed directly these measures on Thailand, Indonesia, and Korea. The problem, however, is that whereas fiscal deficits have tended to be large and inflation chronic in Latin America, in the economies of emerging Asia, budgets had long been roughly in balance. In addition, as the Funds’ economists were unschooled in the links between macro conditions and corporate balance sheets, they failed to perceive the danger of high real interest rates in economies with high debt/equity ratios and low inflationary expectations. High real interest rates have deflationary and crisis-signalling consequences that prompt capital outflows regardless of the attractions of the high rates themselves.</p>
<p>Which is precisely what began to occur in Malaysia. The Malaysian economy experienced a contraction of credit growth from 30 percent in 1997 to minus 5 percent in 1998, reflecting a massive pullback of bank loans. The ringgit plunged, as capital outflows accelerated. A real estate collapse loomed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, seeing the failure in these policies, Prime Minister Mahathir sacked Anwar, and re-imposed capital controls to insulate his economy from the deleterious consequences of rapid hot money outflows. (The trumped-up political charges, which led to the latter’s imprisonment, only came later.) Monetary and fiscal policy became expansionary, the ringgit was pegged to the US dollar, and crisis credit conditions began to diminish as domestic rates were reduced drastically. Although Western finance ministries and institutional investors protested apocalyptically and predicted that Malaysia would remain beyond the pale of the investment world for the foreseeable future, six months later even The Economist, one of the IMF’s great apologists, was forced to acknowledge that the embrace of capital controls had done “short-term wonders” in assisting recovery.</p>
<p>This is all old history. But it is worthwhile recalling the actions of the Fund in the context of what it is advising countries like Iceland and Latvia to do today. Or when considering the hair shirt economics which seems to be championed by Germany’s economic elites.</p>

                                <p>by Rebecca Wilder</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is making tough decisions right now. <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/pf/pdf/pf_2.pdf">Its mandate</a>, “to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates”, is a seriously tall order given current economic conditions.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate sits at 9.7%, while prices have bounced back to 2.6% Y/Y in January. On the surface of it, inflation appears to be gaining some traction; but the big numbers are representative of base effects, and that is really all. The drag on prices remains <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/02/cpi-velocity-trouble.html">very real</a>.</p>
<p>But there is one little kink in the headline figures of unemployment that complicates an already complicated task: extended unemployment insurance. From the FOMC&#8217;s <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20100127.htm">Jan. 26-27 minutes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Though participants agreed there was considerable slack in resource utilization, their judgments about the degree of slack varied. The several extensions of emergency unemployment insurance benefits appeared to have raised the measured unemployment rate, relative to levels recorded in past downturns, by encouraging some who have lost their jobs to remain in the labor force. If that effect were large&#8211;some estimates suggested it could account for 1 percentage point or more of the increase in the unemployment rate during this recession&#8211;then the reported unemployment rate might be overstating the amount of slack in resource utilization relative to past periods of high unemployment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why would extended unemployment benefits increase the unemployment rate? In order to claim unemployment benefits, one must be &#8220;in the labor force&#8221;; and that means looking for work. Therefore, some workers who would otherwise be classified as &#8220;not in the labor force&#8221; remain in the work force as &#8220;unemployed&#8221;. Therefore, the current unemployment rate is elevated above the rate that would occur without the extended benefits. The Fed suggests this differential to be roughly 1% point.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />I am in no way proposing that the extended benefits be rescinded; nor am I deluding myself into thinking that the labor market is anything short of awful. But Fed policy is calibrated to the non-inflation-generating level of the unemployment rate. And the current unemployment rate may be closer to the long-run level than the headline number suggests.</p>
<p>I have talked about this before (see <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2009/09/feds-moving-target-nairu.html">this post</a>) from another angle: the long-run level of unemployment may be a moving target right now, i.e., it&#8217;s likely rising. Therefore, if the long-run level of unemployment is rising and subsidies are masking the true level of the current unemployment rate, then we may very well get some inflation while the economy is still weak.</p>
<p>Of course, I do not believe that we are even near such a threshold level; but it does complicate an already complicated situation. A modified Taylor rule demonstrates the implications for policy.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S4nIisFnhZI/AAAAAAAAC4c/VJ9UsC82wA4/s1600-h/taylor_chart.png"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S4nIisFnhZI/AAAAAAAAC4c/VJ9UsC82wA4/s400/taylor_chart.png"></a>The chart above illustrates the estimated Taylor Rule using the current unemployment rate (in blue line) versus one in which 1% point is shaved off the unemployment rate for every month since January 2008 (green line). The modified rule does suggest that the Fed policy rate is currently at (or now below) the prescribed rate.</p>
<p>Just some food for thought. Rebeca Wilder crossposted with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/">Newsneconomics</a></p>

<p>So it turns out that extreme liberals have higher measured IQs than extreme conservatives and atheists have slightly higher IQs than biblical literalists.</p>
<p>What does this tell us ?  <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/03/endgame-182.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> sent me to <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2010/03/why_it_matters_if_liberals_are.php">this</a> and I learned that people will not accept the fact that not all stochastic variables are normally distributed.</p>
<p>I mean the extreme blind faith in the normal distribution is just not normal.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s like writing &#8220;Assume my grandmother has balls. Is she my grandfather? 100% of my grandmother is male.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyone who knows anything about IQ scores knows that they are not normally distributed.  IQ scores have a fat upper tail.  In other words the calculation is total nonsense and has nothing to do with any intelligent estimate of the fractions of very liberal and very conservative people with IQs over 130.</p>
<p>I mean if one is going to make assumptions which are demonstrably false, one might as well assume the conclusion (yes economics profession I am thinking of us too).</p>
<p>I am very liberal and atheist and *I* think this post (to which Yglesias linked) is clearly total nonsense.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Correlation is not causation, more research and testing is required, etc.</p>
<p>I was working from the concept that home Internet service is a luxury item—or, at the very least, non-essential.*  In short, that you would tend to give up home Internet access if the choice is between that and staying current on your mortgage.</p>
<p>Looking at the State-level data, though, produced the following regression:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>HomeINetAccess = 0.78736*(FICO>660) – 0.1934*(Pct with Current Payment) &#8211; -0.1662*(Lying Broker Loans) + 73.36</p>
<p>R-squared = 0.4311 Adj. R-squared = 0.3956**</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, only the FICO>600 (t=4.10) and the constant (t=7.77) were clearly significant at the 95% confidence level. (Current t = –1.38, Lying Broker t = -0.95). And it seems intuitively obvious that people with better credit scores are more likely to be able to afford (and demand) home-based Internet access.</p>
<p>Removing the “Lying Broker Loans,” strangely, didn’t change the sign, though it did reduce the perceived effect and lower the base constant.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>HomeINetAccess = 0.65055*(FICO>660) – 0.1159*(Pct with Current Payment) + 67.42</p>
<p>R-squared = 0.4204  Adj. R-squared = 0.3967</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, Pct with Current Payment remains an insignificant variable (t = –1.02); indeed, it becomes even more unlikely.</p>
<p>Curiously, there is one random regression that does appear significant.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>HomeINetAccess = 0.43854*(FICO>660) – 0.3099*(Mortgage Originated in 2005 or before) + 80.89</p>
<p>R-squared = 0.429; Adj. R-squared = 0.4057</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, both variables and the constant appear significant (t=3.5, –3.81, and 14.16, respectively).  So we need a story to explain the negative sign, especially since running the same regression against  the“Originated in 2006” or “Originated in 2007” values produces a larger R-squared and results with the intuitively-correct sign:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>HomeINetAccess = 0.40822*(FICO>660) + 0.5340*(Mortgage Originated in 2006) + 47.62</p>
<p>R-squared = 0.5217; Adj. R-squared = 0.5022; t(FICO>660) = 2.98  t(2006) = 3.41</p>
<p>HomeINetAccess = 0.53598*(FICO>660) + 0.5476*(Mortgage Originated in 2007) + 55.02397</p>
<p>R-squared = 0.5034; Adj. R-squared = 0.5112; t(FICO>660) = 4.63 t(2007) = 3.57</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So people who bought at the peak of the bubble, or even when the bubble was beginning to break, are more likely to have Home Internet access than those who have been living in their house for a longer period of time.  Indeed, having lived in your house for a longer period of time correlates <em>negatively</em>, on a State level, with having Home Internet access.</p>
<p>Were we to speculate, we might guess that people who have been living in their homes longer did not have Internet access easily available and affordable when they bought their home, and have not decided to add it now.  (This would imply either that there are major transaction costs associated with gaining Internet access or that the people who bought in the pre-2006 environment are resource-constrained in other ways.)</p>
<p>As a reasonable speculation, people who bought in 2006 and 2007—arguably, the top of the market—have (or believed they have) less price sensitivity than those who bought while the bubble was inflating.  This might suggest that the people who were buying in 2006 were more likely to be “trading up” than buying for the first time. There is anecdotal evidence to that effect. Looking at the graphic of U.S. home ownership percentage:
<p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S47LMaIxxWI/AAAAAAAAAZo/nW4EVk2iicY/s1600-h/ownership0012.png"><img title="ownership001" height="179" alt="ownership001" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S47LM2ykxZI/AAAAAAAAAZs/z8N698CrGZI/ownership001_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="244" border="0"></a></p>
<p>it appears that by 2006, the market consisted more of homeowners and speculators than it did new buyers, but the data I’m using does not have the granularity either to accept or reject that hypothesis.***</p>
<p>In any event, further research appears to be needed—or, maybe, this is just the Spurious Correlation of the Day.</p>
<p>*<a href="http://highclearing.com/index.php/archives/2010/03/01/10789" target="_blank">Jim Henley</a>—and any other parent whose daughter is a <a href="http://clubpenguin.com/" target="_blank">Club Penguin</a> devotee (for instance, me)—might disagree.</p>
<p>**Those not in the social sciences will look at these R-squared values and wonder if there is anything being presented.  40% is, I am told, a very good result.  Indeed, since the entirety of Real Business Cycle theory is hung on an R-squared close to 0.50, certainly a finger exercise with a result that is only 80% of that would be, if not earth-shattering, then at least publishable.</p>
</p>
<p>***Suggestions for sources that might indicate whether buyers were speculators—e.g., state-level data that indicates if property was being purchased to be a primary residence or second (“vacation”) home—might be available are welcome in comments or via e-mail.</p>

<p>Health Care Reform is Already Happening</p>
<p>Ohio State University Medical Center has built an affiliated physician group of more than 600 physicians. Effective by January 1, 2011, the physicians will be merged into OSUMC (not as medical school faculty) and will be full employees of OSUMC.</p>
<p>OSUMC will do all billing under a consolidated provider number and create a system wide electronic medical record.</p>
<p>This is an &#8220;integrated delivery system&#8221; (IDS), the strongest trend in health care delivery reform these days.</p>
<p>This is not new, the health care reform discussion in the early 90s created the first major wave of integration. Many of these efforts were massive flops, some worked well and other just cripple along.</p>
<p>Hospitals are not always able to properly manage physician practices, like the skilled driver of an 18-wheeler cannot jump into NASCAR, same concept, much different execution.</p>
<p>An IDS will presumably have much great bargaining power with health insurers, and there is a school of thought that health care costs could actually be driven up.</p>
<p>Without or without action in Washington, health care reform is moving ahead.</p>

<p>In a couple of prior postings (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Part 2</a>), I considered (1) Darrell Duffie&#8217;s op-ed in the Wall St. Journal asserting that financial institution speculation in the markets is &#8220;good&#8221; for us and (2) the question of financial institution speculation in credit default swaps on Greek debt as a possible factor in the worsening of Greece&#8217;s financial situation.</p>
<p>Speculation seems to be on everybody&#8217;s mind these days.  The Economist, for example, is running a debate on the question of the value of financial innovation, here.  Volcker famously has commented that about the only financial innovation of the last century that was really worth anything was the ATM, as the moderator noted inher opening remarks.</p>
<blockquote><p>A few years ago America&#8217;s sophisticated financial system was hailed as a pillar of its economic prowess. The geeks on Wall Street and their whizzy new products symbolised the success of American capitalism just as much as the geeks in Silicon Valley. Today things look very different. After the worst financial crisis and deepest recession since the 1930s, Wall Street has become synonymous with greed and irresponsibility in the public mind. And while no one doubts that financial innovation made a lot of financiers extremely rich, a growing number of people question whether it did much, if any, good for the broader economy. Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and an advisor to President Obama, has famously claimed that he can find &#8220;very little evidence&#8221; that massive financial innovation in recent years has done anything to boost the economy. The most important recent innovation in finance, he argues, is the ATM.  Id.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />The debate is about cutting edge financial innovation as came into style in the 1980s&#8211;mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps and other financially engineered derivative instruments and innovations like exchange-traded funds and inflation-protected bonds. So who are the voices for the Con and Pro side on &#8220;love that speculation and financial innovation&#8221; at The Economist?  It&#8217;s Joe Stiglitz, Nobel prizewinning neo-Keynesian (who should, in my opinion, have been appointed to the position that Larry Summers holds in the Obama administration) arguing against the value of most financial innovation&#8211;the &#8220;right kind&#8221; he says, could help financial institutions fulfill their core functions more efficiently, saving money and therefore contributing to economic growth. &#8220;But for the most part, that&#8217;s not the kind of financial innovation we have had.&#8221;  Most of the recent financial innovations have been primarily accounting gimmicks and inventions designed to game the tax system&#8211;In my terms, those are not productive investments that move technological innovation, but shell games to fool regulators and pocket the windfall for the wealthy few.  Een the inventions that had the potential to stablize the financial system actually ended up destabilizing it, because of their abuse in the furtherance of greed.  And in the other corner, it&#8217;s Ross Levine, Professor of Economics at Brown, who thinks financial innovation is &#8220;crucial, indeed indispensable&#8221; for economic growth.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, I think Stiglitz has the winning argument here about the questionable value of most of the late 20th century financial innovation.</p>
<blockquote><p>We should not be surprised that the so-called innovation did not yield the real growth benefits promised. The financial sector is rife with incentives (at both the organisational and individual levels) for excessive risk-taking and short-sighted behaviour. There are major misalignments between private rewards and social returns. There are pervasive externalities and agency problems. We have seen the consequences in the Great Recession which the financial sector brought upon the world&#8217;s economy. But the consequences are also reflected in the nature of innovation, which, for the most part, was not directed at enhancing the ability of the financial sector to perform its social functions, even though the innovations may have enhanced the private rewards of finance executives. (Indeed, it is not even clear that shareholders and bondholders benefited; we do know that the rest of society—homeowners, taxpayers and workers—suffered.)</p>
<p>Some of the innovations, had they been appropriately used, might have enabled the better management of risk. But, as Warren Buffett has pointed out, the derivatives were financial weapons of mass destruction. They were easier to abuse than to use well. And there were incentives for abuse.</p></blockquote>

<p>Any questions?</p>
<p>I know, kind of corny; and I did grapple over which set of economies should be labeled &#8220;on drugs&#8221;, the BIICs or the Majors.</p>
<p>And BIICs is NOT a typo. I&#8217;m going with BIICs now &#8211; Brazil, Indonesia, India, and China. This is a modified version of <a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/ideas/brics/index.html">Jim O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s famous cohort, the BRICs</a> (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), whose economies in $ terms are expected to jointly transcend the G6 by 2050. Russia&#8217;s been ousted for reasons that I will discuss at a later time.</p>
<p>Soon to come: Indonesia vs. Russia.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I commented on Darrell Duffie&#8217;s defense of speculation in the Wall Street Journal, here.  I noted that the idea that speculation is a positive because it absorbs risk others don&#8217;t want and helps reveal the &#8220;true price&#8221; by providing more information about the speculated item seems more of a stretch in the midst of this crisis than we might have thought before.  Absorption of risk only works if there is a more or less even playing field, with some long and some short, but that adds little to information or price.  If there is an abundance of information on price&#8211;because traders are shorting the stock or rushing for credit default swaps, then that information will  tend to swing the price and make it much more difficult for speculators to absorb the risk, as the market teeters offbalance on that item and pushes the item more and more to the cliff that the speculators have predicted.</p>
<p>Whatever the underlying problem in Greece, financial speculation has been a factor in tilting the balance towards disaster.  The price of credit default swaps has gone up, and each time that Greece tries to borrow to pay its debt, it has to pay more and the CDS cost goes up and Greece looks riskier in a vicious cycle threatening illiquidity.  Thus, one commentator notes that &#8220;credit default swaps give the illusion of safety, but actually increase systemic risk.

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>So there are several comments to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/02/working-refs.html">my previous post</a>. Ignoring the a good one from Dr. DeLong, several people are taking umbrage at my unsubtle suggestion that the effect on employment being suggested is, to be polite about it, rather creative.</p>
<p>kharris begins, &#8220;So let me see if I have this right.  If anybody tries to figure out what the impact of snow on economic data might be, they are big fat liars?  But those who know that the economy is in bad shape, without reference to actual events, is a stand-up kind of hack?&#8221;</p>
<p>Following is an expansion of my comment in that thread, with data:</p>
<p>To the second question, well, I may be a hack, but my stand-up days are in the past. But given the choice between believing that the recovery is in full swing and that long-term unemployment is getting worse and jobs are not and will not be created, well, I&#8217;ll take <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10871/BudgetOutlook2010_Jan.cfm">the CBO projection</a> as the baseline:<br />
<blockquote>CBO expects the unemployment rate to average a little over 10 percent for the first half of 2010, and it will probably not dip below 9 percent until 2012.</p></blockquote>
<p>and note that if we&#8217;re calling that a recovery, our definitions have become Very Generous.  So bold claims of recovery need to be tempered by the prospect of worse headline unemployment (U-3) for the next five months (including February) and no significant recovery for the eighteen after all.</p>
<p>Sorry I&#8217;m not doing handstands that GDP might be slightly positive for a few quarters of sub-replacement level employment increases, but I didn&#8217;t cheer the &#8220;recovery&#8221; of 2002 either, so at least I&#8217;m a consistent hack.</p>
<p>To the first: Not at all; trying to figure out the effect is fair game and perfectly reasonable.  But the declarations so far are all running in one direction: we believe the economy is better than the data will be, so we need to wait if it looks bad.  (See <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/02/auto-sales-blame-it-on-snow-and-toyota.html">Ms. Caldwell as quoted by CR</a> or <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/snowmageddon-still-has-time-to-kill-health-care-reform/">Catherine Rampell</a>, for example.)  Rampell:<br />
<blockquote>That report will probably be very, very ugly. I have seen some forecasters project job losses as high as 100,000.</p>
<p>The main culprit behind the expected jobs plunge is the blizzard, which closed businesses and kept people from going to work or even seeking work for days and sometimes weeks. These work stoppages probably occurred precisely when the government was collecting data for its February jobs report.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the current estimates are all that (1) demand was down and (2) employment was down.</p>
<p>And (3) deliveries were down: see <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/03/01/ism-manufacturing-index-shows-impact-of-snow/">the ISM data</a>.<br />
<blockquote> Put it all together, and you can tell a story of heavy snow snarling shipments to and from manufacturers, slowing down production growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>But at least in this case, we have a clear indicator: the increase in backlogged orders.</p>
<p>Finally, (4)<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/03/01/after-the-tape-new-frugality-not-so-fast/">savings</a>.<br />
<blockquote>The reasons for the stall are twofold: For one, rebounding wealth since the recession’s depths has helped provide some support for consumer spending. Secondly, weak income growth has left other consumers with little choice but to spend proportionally more of their incomes, particularly in light of [5] still-tight credit conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>So demand, supply, savings, credit, and employment are all down.  The first and second are aberrations of snow (and equilibrium), the second and third abide.</p>
<p>Which leaves employment, which is discussed in more detail than most sane people would want below the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Now, it is clear that people who are employed did not work in the week. But they are not likely to have reported themselves as &#8220;unemployed&#8221; or (except in a very literal sense) &#8220;out of work.&#8221;  True, they did not produce—but what they would have produced was not bought, and hence there is a backlog of orders.</p>
<p>But companies that now have backlogs of orders know that this was because they did not have their current workforce.  Accept an order to produce, say, 200 units (which takes a month to produce) and lose five to eight business days and you&#8217;ll be 50-80 units behind.</p>
<p><strong><em>But you&#8217;re not going to go out and hire a new person to fill the backlog.</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes, there was an effect on production and sales. But the idea that 100-200K jobs went unfulfilled solely because of weather conditions that were aberrant primarily in the mid-Continent is either (1) rather optimistic or (2) ignoring that the excess snow effect was mostly in the areas that are least underemployed. (See  <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/underemployment-state-by-state/">this nice map from Catherine Rampell</a>)</p>
<p>So in the best case scenario, the recovery was muted because things were not delivered or sold—though money (savings) was (were) spent.  And the only reason firms didn&#8217;t hire was the snowstorm that closed D.C. and delayed Philadelphia. (Though there was no snow in NYC and, as noted, nothing unusual about the fallings in the Midwest.)</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is that demand wasn&#8217;t filled solely because supply wasn&#8217;t available because existing workers could not produce.  Working on the &#8220;nine women pregnant for a month don&#8217;t produce a baby and you have a real problem eight months thereafter&#8221; rule, employers will (generally correctly) view their February backlog as a result of existing labor not working, not as a need to hire new workers. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re balancing the effects of those two—standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slutsky_equation">Slutsky analysis</a>, as it were—there is a high likelihood that hiring will be dampened <em>going forward</em> by the snowstorm as firms underestimate actual demand.  It is less likely that actual hiring was significantly reduced by it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the way the discussion is going. So a bad (negative) number has excuses, a poor number (positive, but less than replacement rate) has excuses and should be seen as &#8220;good,&#8221; and a good number (replacement rate or better) will mean &#8220;all ahead full.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I tried looking at ancillary data.  Looking at <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/epm_sum.html">power usage</a>, for instance, indicates a major decline that would correspond to less activity(Table 1.6.b; Commercial usage YOY down 3.6%; Industrial usage YOY down 5.6% with declines in all areas; total usage down 4.3% YOY [Table 1.1])—but that&#8217;s only through November.</p>
<p>Maybe the past three months have been part of a miraculous recovery.  But it&#8217;s not in employment, its not in the available energy usage data, and it doesn&#8217;t follow from the ISM data, which indicates slow growth at best.</p>
<p>Those who want to claim the economy is recovered have been, as noted, &#8220;working the refs.&#8221; So a bad number (by Rampell&#8217;s apparent reasoning) will kill health care reform, but not mean that we need a second stimulus—even though <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/02/26/state-budgets-still-falling-like-its-2008/">the states are hemorrhaging money and, soon, jobs</a>. (Teachers, police and fire&#8211;you know, all the nonessential personnel.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a heads-we-win-tails-we-win-more situation being set up.</p>
<p>If we pretend that all of the argument are true: that the snowstorm was a once-in-a-lifetime event and that it really did produce a major skew though, we might want to look at what happened the last time a &#8220;once-in-a-lifetime event&#8221; occurred near the end of a recession.
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4x-KNz4RjI/AAAAAAAAAZc/ut-apaACICQ/s1600-h/Emply20012002.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4x-KNz4RjI/AAAAAAAAAZc/ut-apaACICQ/s400/Emply20012002.png" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The vertical lines are at September and December of 2001.  For a week in September, everyone—and this time I mean <em>everyone</em>, not just the bottom third of the Bos-Wash corridor—stopped shopping for a week.  As predicted above, the employment effects abided for at least the next few months. (Recall, after all, that that recession <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">officially</a> ended in November.)</p>
<p>Given the choice between (1) assuming that there will be a one-off decline in employment due to the snow and that everything will return to recovery next month or (2) that there will be a lingering, negative employment effect from the snowstorm and attendant business slowdowns, there appears to be only one way to bet, given the data and the history.</p>
<p>Yet the calls right now—absent evidence—are going the other way.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re working from anecdotal evidence, then certainly there is a recovery. It&#8217;s the extant data that doesn&#8217;t support any recovery that is not also described as &#8220;jobless and uncertain.&#8221; That may change on Friday.  But it&#8217;s not the way to bet, no matter how much the refs are worked.</p>
