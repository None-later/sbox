<blockquote>The Department of Justice and the state of Missouri have each announced criminal plea bargains with one Lorraine Brown, former chief executive of DocX, the Lender Processing subsidiary best known for its <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/10/4closurefraud-posts-docx-mortgage-document-fabrication-price-sheet.html">price sheet for fabricating the mortgage documents</a> a servicer, or frankly, anyone would need to claim they had standing to foreclose on your home. Funny how that particular DocX product was mentioned no where in the plea deals.<br /><strong>…</strong></p>
<p>Brown admitted guilt to perpetrating a six-year scheme, from 2003 to 2009 to forge and falsify over a million signatures, including now-infamous practices such as “surrogate signing”, in which other employees, typically temps, would forge the signatures of robosigners. The federal penalties are up to five years in prison plus $250,000 in fines; the Missouri penalties re two to three years in prison.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Several things are striking about this deal. First is that it appears that the Missouri suit against Brown goaded the Feds to join. It’s hardly unheard of for state regulators to embarrass their Federal counterparts into action, and the DoJ probably could not afford to sit out a successful prosecution on its beat, particularly after all the noise the Obama Administration has made about its new, improved anti mortgage fraud efforts. But that makes the second item more striking: how the “statement of facts” presents Brown as deceiving Lender Processing Services about her illegal actions. Brown is thus a rogue executive whose misdeeds presumably don’t have bigger implications for LPS or the industry. It’s nauseating to see the filings take that position and contain statements like this:<br />When hiring DocX to sign documents, servicers typically issued special corporate resolutions delegating document execution authority to specific, authorized, and trained personnel at DocX. The DocX employees who were given express signing authority from DocX’s clients and who, as represented by Brown, were purportedly trained to ensure that the clients’ documents were properly created, signed, and notarized were called “Authorized Signers.” These documents were then generally recorded by DocX with the appropriate local property recorders’ offices throughout the country.<br />Read more at <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/11/justice-in-america-systematic-document-forgery-and-fabrication-yields-one-criminal-plea-bargain.html#KsHfMdUvXWFQf1X3.99">Naked Capitalism</a></p>

                                <p>1/24/12  Links worth noting by Linda Beale:</p>
<p> Germany rejects Swiss banking secrecy deal;   Labor Devaluation </p>
<p> David Jolly, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/business/global/german-lawmakers-reject-swiss-tax-deal.html">German Lawmakers Reject Swiss Tax Deal</a>, New York Times (Nov. 23, 2012).<br />The US and other countries like Germany have been pressing the Swiss on their bank secrecy, which allows U.S. and other foreign citizens to establish bank accounts without the knowledge of the home country and thus hide assets and income from home-country taxation.  The US passed laws (called by the acronym &#8220;FATCA&#8221;) that require foreign banks to actively report information on US accountholders.   The hope is that every country will recognize the harm done to tax systems by banking secrecy and join in imposing similar information-reporting requirements. </p>
<p>The Swiss, meanwhile, have been trying to circumvent universal adoption of such laws.  See, e.g., Nicholas Shaxson, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/22/scheme-trillions-tax-havens-scuppered">A scheme designed to net trillions from tax haves is being scuppered</a>, Guardian.com (Nov. 22, 2012).   Britain, Luxemburg and Austria are cited as being in the forefront of the scuttling movement:  Britain, for example, has entered into a &#8220;Rubrik Agreement&#8221; with the Swiss.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The Swiss thought they had a deal with Germany.  This would be a bilateral deal in which the Swiss agree to an upfront payment in lieu of any back taxes on the accounts and then agree to act as tax collector for the foreign government on the accounts, thus maintaining secret the identity of the foreign taxpayers. <br />Such an agreement is problematic for two reasons:  (i) it requires the foreign government to trust the Swiss banks to pay the right amount over in taxes and (ii) it undermines the drive to eliminate offshore banking secrecy as a cover for tax evasion. </p>
<p>Transparency in international banking and taxation matters would require that banks provide information on accounts held by foreigners to the foreigners&#8217; home jurisdictions, without any account-specific or accountholder-specific request required.  The reason for a more transparent rule is that otherwise the home jurisdiction has to have information it does not have (who has an account at a Swiss bank) before it can ask for the information it needs to ferret out who has such an account and may be engaging in tax evasion.  The biggest cracks in banking secrecy have thus come from  whistleblowers and opportunists who sell account-holder information to purchasing jurisdictions. </p>
<p>Friday, the Germans rejected&#8211;for now at least&#8211;a German-Swiss deal supported by Chancellor Merkel that had been two years in the making.  France is apparently also considering rethinking a similar deal.<br />The Swiss leverage was clearly stated by Swiss banking official Mario Tuor, who &#8220;<i>noted that without a deal, the status quo would remain: German officials can seek specific information from the Swiss government on people suspected of tax evasion, or go back to buying data stolen from Swiss banks. &#8216;With an agreement, every German taxpayer in Switzerland would be taxed</i>,&#8217; Mr. Tuor said.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/business/global/german-lawmakers-reject-swiss-tax-deal.html">German Lawmakers Reject Swiss Tax Deal</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.twohalfhitches.blogspot.com/2012/02/steady-devaluation-of-human-labor.html">The Steady Devaluation of Labor</a>, Two Half Hitches (Feb. 2012).</p>
<p>This is an oldie but goodie, one worth reminding you of (or calling to your attention for the first time).<br />[The] minimum wage, in constant dollars, has had its ups and downs since 1970 but the overall trend indicated by the straight black line is down. The numbers show that the American economy puts less value on the entry level worker than it did in 1970. Why is that? Are minimum wage workers less intelligent now than they were forty years ago? Are they lazier?</p>
<p>The reason probably has a lot to do with the rise of the global economy and cheaper Chinese labor. It may also have to do with basic attitudes toward labor. <a href="http://politicalcorrection.org/blog/201106020015">Some see labor as a commodity</a>, while <a href="http://www.inthesetimes.com/working/entry/7239/labor_is_not_a_commodity/">others believe it is not.  </a></p>
<p>***<br />Representative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_King">Steve King (R-IA)</a> on the floor of the House of Representatives last year: </p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Labor is a commodity just like corn or beans or oil or gold, and the value of it needs to be determined by the competition, supply and demand in the workplace.&#8221;</strong><br /><strong></strong><br /><strong>***</strong><strong> </strong><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Gompers">Samuel Gompers</a>, cigar maker-turned-labor organizer and founder of the American Federation of Labor in the early 20th Century, had a different business ethic related to labor and said this:<br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>“You cannot weigh the human soul in the same scales with a piece of pork.”</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> Labor advocates actually managed to insert a statement affirming the status of human labor in the 1914 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Act">Clayton Antitrust Act</a>:  <strong>“The labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce.”</strong></p>

                                <p>I’ve been reading <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8R3NrzE8veEC&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;dq=johnson+ghost+map&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=UFmxUJfUMMjziQLitYHAAQ&#038;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false">Steven Johnson’s <em>The Ghost Map</em></a>, about the London cholera epidemic of 1854, and one passage reminded me exactly of today’s economics discipline.</p>
<p>The sense of similarity was heightened because I also (instigated by <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/07/can-you-please-read-a-first-year-textbook.html">Nick Rowe</a>) happened to be reading <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xoztFMavGCcC&#038;pg=PA273&#038;lpg=PA273&#038;dq=%22rising+marginal+cost%22+mankiw&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=5S2vEuP1mj&#038;sig=DWA8HrJDg7l0QxxurXXH2ijj8s4&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=4QqwUNW-EIvYigKU6YHwDA&#038;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&#038;q=%22rising%20marginal%20cost%22%20mankiw&#038;f=false">Mankiw’s micro textbook section on the rising marginal cost of production</a> — a notion that 1. is ridiculous on its face, 2. is completely contrary to how profit-maximizing producers think, and 3. is based on just-plain incorrect math.* It’s just one of many central pillars of “textbook” economics that are still being taught with a straight face, even though they been resoundingly disproved <em>by the discipline’s own leading practitioners, </em>on the discipline’s own terms, and using its own language, constructs, and methods. These zombie ideas just won’t die. (Or to quote my friend Ole, “People never learn, and they never forget.”)</p>
<p>Economics today has a profound resemblance to medicine before the germ theory of disease.</p>
<p>Lots of people in 1854 were trying to figure out what caused cholera, and how it was transmitted. The dominant theory was “miasma” — basically bad air emanating from smelly, unsanitary conditions, especially in poor areas with lots of leaking, overflowing basement cesspools full of shit. These were contaminating the water supply, of course, so the real transmission mechanism was people drinking the effluent from previous victims.</p>
<p>The solution to the miasma problem? Empty the cesspools into the Thames — systematically poisoning the water supply. Yes, that’s what they did.</p>
<p>The miasma theory had incredible staying power, even though it was clearly and patently disproved by the thousands of Londoners whose vocation was slopping through the sewers, day and night (presumably in the thickest of possible miasmas), searching for anything valuable that they could sell. They didn’t get cholera or die at any greater rate — perhaps even less.</p>
<p>Johnson:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why was the miasma theory so persuasive? Why did so many brilliant minds cling to it, despite the mounting evidence that suggested it was false? … Whenever smart people cling to an outlandishly incorrect idea despite substantial evidence to the contrary, something interesting is at work. In the case of miasma, that something involves a convergence of multiple forces, all coming together to prop up a theory that should have died out decades before. Some of those forces were ideological in nature, matters of social prejudice and convention. Some revolved around conceptual limitations, failures of imagination and analysis. Some involve the basic wiring of the human brain itself. Each on its own might not have been strong enough to persuade an entire public-health system to empty raw sewage into the Thames. But together they created a kind of perfect storm of error.</p>
<p>Miasma certainly had the force of tradition on its side. … Just about every epidemic disease on record has been, at one point or another, attributed to poisoned miasma. …</p>
<p>But tradition alone can’t account for the predominance of the miasma theory. The Victorians who clung to it were in almost every other respect true revolutionaries, living in revolutionary times: Chadwick was inventing a whole new model for shaping public health; Farr transforming the use of statistics; Nightingale challenging countless received ideas about the role of women in professional life, as well as the practice of nursing. Dickens, Engels, Mayhew — these  were not people naturally inclined to accept the status quo. In fact, they were all, in their separate ways, spoiling for a fight. So it’s not sufficient to blame their adherence to the miasma theory purely on its long pedigree.</p>
<p>The perseverance of miasma theory into the nineteenth century was as much a matter of instinct as it was intellectual tradition. Again and again in the literature of miasma, the argument is inextricably linked to the author’s visceral disgust at the smells of the city. The sense of smell is often described as the most primitive of the senses, provoking powerful feelings of lust or repulsion…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s worth pointing out here the <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/haidt08/haidt08_index.html">work of Jonathan Haidt et al</a> showing that conservatives have a big “purity” and “disgust” dimension to their moral roadmap, a dimension that is largely absent or far more muted among liberals. Which leads to…</p>
<blockquote><p>Raw social prejudice also played a role. Like the other great scientific embarrassment of the period – phrenology — the miasma theory was regularly invoked to justify all sorts of groundless class and ethnic biases. … The predisposing cause lay in the bodies of the sufferers themselves. That constitutional failing was invariably linked to moral or social failing: poverty, alcohol abuse, unsanitary living. One alleged expert argued in 1850: “The probability of an outburst or increase during [calm, mild] weather, I believed to be heightened on holidays, Saturdays, Sundays, and any other occasions where opportunities were afforded the lower classes for dissipation and debauchery.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So disease epidemics are clearly the result of the 40-hour work week. You can find the modern-day equivalent in John Cochrane and Casey Mulligan’s assertions that today’s unemployment has nothing to do with the high job-seeker-to-job-opening ratio (caused by lack of demand for producers’ goods, and their ensuing non-need for more workers), but rather results from workers being unwilling to work at low wages (and being coddled by government programs).</p>
<blockquote><p>Like much of the reasoning that lay behind the miasma theory, the idea of an inner constitution was not entirely wrong; immune systems do vary from person to person, and some people may indeed be resistant to epidemic diseases like cholera or smallpox or plague. The scaffolding that kept miasma propped up for so long was largely made up of comparable half-truths, correlations mistaken for causes. Methane and hydrogen sulfide <em>were </em>in fact poisons, after all; they just weren’t concentrated enough in the city air to cause real damage. People <em>were </em>more likely to die of cholera at lower elevations, but not for the reasons Farr imagined. And the poor <em>did </em>have higher rates of contagion than the well-to-do, but not because they were morally debauched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, there are many valid and semi-valid ideas, theories, and constructs floating around in the world of textbook economics. But they are so intertwined with, caught up in the miasma, or phlogiston, or epicycle theories that today constitute mainstream economics (think: equilibrium, rational expectations, etc.) that it’s hard for even the clearest-eyed economist — much less the everyday person or Washington staffer, legislator, or policy wonk — to tell the shit from the shinola.</p>
<p>Without trying to take the metaphor too far, I’d like to suggest that today’s austerians are in favor of emptying the cesspools into the water supply — based on similarly loopy reasoning.</p>
<p>* The rising marginal cost theory is ridiculous on its face because it assumes that producers add one factor of production at a time — hire more workers, for instance, without renting more space for them to work. (This is exactly what Mankiw describes in his textbook; see “Thirsty Thelma’s.”) Voila! Each worker’s productivity declines. This is of course not what producers do, which is why only 11% of top-corporation execs say they face rising marginal costs of production. (I’m wondering if that 11% made the mistake of taking an intro econ class in college.) For a nice recap of that executive survey, and the faulty math of rising marginal costs, see <a href="http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue53/KeenStandish53.pdf">here</a> (PDF).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-mcbride-of-calculated-risk-2012-11" target="_blank">Joe Weisenthal at Business Insider</a> offers some hyperbole in <i>The Genius Who Invented Economics Blogging Reveals How He Got Everything Right And What&#8217;s Coming Next</i>, but also offers well deserved praise for Bill McBride and Calculated Risk.  Paul Krugman in the NYT posts  <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/21/all-hail-calculated-risk/" target="_blank">All Hail Calculated Risk</a> and praises Bill&#8217;s work as well. </p>
<p>Bill has a gift for telling an evolving story in graph form that readers can follow over time, such as this one on jobs, and picking data that has held up over time as well as being useful.  (Economist Spencer England praises Bill&#8217;s data in our own <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/state-unemployment-rates.html" target="_blank">Employment Situation Reports</a> this year)</p>

<p>As Bill makes clear on his website, <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/p/doris-tanta-dungey.html" target="_blank">Tanta</a> was an important part of Calculated Risk beginnings.

<p> Karl Rove on the so-called &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221;</p>
<p> In a video interview available from Dow Jones/Wall Street Journal, &#8220;<a href="http://live.wsj.com/video/karl-rove-doubt-a%20fiscal-cliff-deal-will-get-done/0450996E-14C8-4D74-8565-656AB30EED8B.html">Karl Rove Doubts a Fiscal Cliff Deal Will Get Done</a>&#8221; (Nov. 20, 2012),  Karl Rove&#8217;s pre-Thanksgiving news to the world is exactly what one would expect from one of the most successful GOP strategists.  He urges Repubicans to do everything possible to find &#8220;reasonable compromises without sacrificing principles&#8221;, which means entitlement reform coupled with offsetting revenues without increasing tax rates.</p>
<p>I. This is nothing new.  </p>
<p><strong>Rove doesn&#8217;t want the GOP to accept any rate increases and he does want the GOP to play the obstructionist role to the hilt unless they get their longed-for undermining of the New Deal Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs</strong>. </p>
<p>The flawed argument is the same as Romney&#8217;s arrogant economic message in the presidential campaign&#8211;that increased revenues will come from economic growth gained from running the country&#8217;s economy to support Big Business.  And the GOP insists that it will only happen if they can get the purported bad-guy Democrats to accede to the Republican policy demands of continued preferential taxation of the wealthy and corporate America, increased spending for the military, continued regulatory inattention to the financialization of the economy, combined with spending cuts to safety net programs.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Rove&#8217;s position essentially insists on the government folloowing the GOP&#8217;s long-debunked market fundamentalism that assumes that the &#8220;dynamics&#8221; of spending cuts to the GOP-hated so-called &#8220;entitlements&#8221; (and not to the GOP-loved military budget) will immediately cause the economy to bloom and result in all the revenues needed (by the &#8220;appropriately&#8221; shrunken federal government), while the elite continue to rip-off the economy with &#8220;rent&#8221; profits.  And even if the &#8220;compromise&#8221; was to allow some increase in tax payments through cutting back deductions that primarily benefit the elite, one can imagine that those cutbacks will be relatively minor and short-lived. </p>
<p><strong>II. The strategy is nonetheless revealing.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> What is most interesting here is not Rove&#8217;s continued reliance on the same old failed Reaganomics arguments from the past re adhering to GOP &#8220;principles&#8221;.  It is his post-election strategy for how to achieve it.<strong> </strong>He is &#8220;dubious&#8221; that a deal can get done in the few days left in this congressional session. <strong> His solution&#8211;Congress should agree to carry on the &#8220;status quo ante&#8221; for a few months andthen arrive at a solution. </strong><br />Rove knows what progressives know (and what I&#8217;ve insisted on in this blog): the Democrats have the rare upper-hand at this point in the legislative cycle. </p>
<p>The Republicans agreed to the passage of a law (the so-called &#8220;sequester&#8221;) that cuts otherwise slated increases to the military and also cuts a variety of domestic non-military expenditures.  The Republicans also joined with Democrats to pass a two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts two years ago, when they thought that they would control the White House and  the Senate after the 2012 elections and be able, finally, to deliver on their original intent to make the &#8220;temporary&#8221; Bush tax cuts permanent, thus guaranteeing a crop of preferential tax provisions for the very wealthy and multinational corporations while carrying out their long-term objective of privatizing and reducing safety net programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. <br />Republicans have less ammunition to carry out their obstructionist and New Deal-defeating agenda&#8211;the laws that cut the military budget, protect the safety net programs, and increase tax rates are already enacted. <br />Unless the GOP can convince the public and the Dems in Congress that there really is a fiscal &#8220;cliff&#8221; that spells suicide for the US economy, they are caught short in their legislative strategy.  They relied on a wipe-out victory in the 2012 elections.  Permanent reductions in taxes for the rich, deregulation, privatization/decimation of the New Deal safety net programs, and ever-increasing support for the military are much less easily put into law without one-party control.</p>
<p>The Democrats should not be willing to negotiate against interest just to kick the ball down the road to a period when they will have fewer strategic advantages on their side!  Democrats&#8211;with Obama in the lead&#8211;should insist on enactment of a bill making permanent tax cuts for the lower-middle and lower-income classes&#8211;ie, a group that almost no one thinks should have to pay more in a time of continuing slow growth out of the Bush recession years. </p>
<p>If the Republicans refuse to pass such a law, the Dems should not kow-tow to the GOP&#8217;s so-called &#8220;compromise&#8221; position of re-extending the full Bush tax cuts and caving to earned benefit program cuts.  Instead, the Dems should let the Bush tax cuts expire as slated and do nothing about the sequester and by all means do nothing to reduce benefits to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.  In January, President Obama and the progressives in the House and Senate should mount an aggressive campaign to pass a well-considered slate of tax cuts for the lower and lower-middle income distribution and a few well-targeted stimulus measures in support of public infrastructure and lower-income unemployment relief. </p>
<p>Only after those measures are in place should there be any discussion of an &#8220;overhaul&#8221; of the tax code&#8211;and that overhaul should be handled in the context of raising sufficient revenues to pay for things we as a people know we should provide&#8211;decent retirement and health care for elderly Americans, decent educational support for young Americans, decent opportunities for a sustainable life for poor Americans, and the revitalization of the middle class who have been the losers of the last decades of class warfare.  The super-rich elite don&#8217;t deserve much attention at all in this debate&#8211;they have been the winners and their winning has not in any way built a sustainable, job-creating economy. </p>

<p>Everything is possible and I think that Dean Baker just lost a debate with a Washington Post reporter.<br />   <br />Post reporter Zachary A. Goldfarb  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/economists-obama-administration-at-odds-over-role-of-mortgage-debt-in-slow-recovery/2012/11/22/dc83f25e-2e87-11e2-89d4-040c9330702a_story.html">wrote</a></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1961211">The two economists compared what happened in U.S. counties where people had amassed huge debts with those where people had borrowed little.</a> It had long been thought that when property values declined in value, homeowners would spend less because they would feel less wealthy. <br />But Mian and Sufi’s research showed something more specific and powerful at work: People who owed huge debts when their home values declined cut back dramatically on buying cars, appliances, furniture and groceries. The more they owed, the less they spent. People with little debt hardly slowed spending at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>among other things.  The link is his.  </p>
<p>Dean Baker <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/underwater-homeowners-cannot-explain-the-weak-recovery">wrote</a>  <br />
<blockquote>The <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&#038;q=housing+wealth+effect&#038;btnG=&#038;as_sdt=1%2C9&#038;as_sdtp=">housing wealth</a> effect is one of the oldest and most widely accepted concepts in economics. It is generally estimated people spend between 5 and 7 cents each year per dollar of housing wealth. This means that the collapse of the bubble would be expected to cost the economy between $400 billion and $560 billion in annual demand. </p></blockquote>
<p>among other things  Again the link is his.<br />   <br />Baker&#8217;s main point is that low consumption by underwater home owners is not a plausible explanation of the sluggish recovery.  However, he also confidently asserts that the housing wealth effect is linear based on &#8220;google it&#8221;.  I think that he has decided that new empirical research is irrelevant, because he already knew how economies work.<br />    <br />My comment below the fold.</p>
<p>In the comment I define your disagreement with post reporter  Zachary A. Goldfarb as a disagreement about whether reduced but still positive home equity causes a reduction of consumption on the order of between 5 and 7 cents each year per dollar of housing wealth or on the order of zero.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>    <br />That is, I won&#8217;t address you valid points that the recovery of consumption was roughly normal while the recovery of house construction was not.</p>
<p>Notably Goldfarb cites empirical estimates based on micro data.  He claims there is a significant change in the slope of the home equity effect on consumption at home equity equals zero.  To say he is wrong, you must convince me that the 5 to 7 % estimate is valid for a sample containing only homeowners with positive equity.<br />    <br />An estimate with aggregate data just does not address the claim in the article which you criticize.    <br />Notably, in this case the Washington Post cites specific research by named economists.  You, in contrast, cite what all macroeconomists know.<br />    <br />I am shocked to find that I call this one for The Washington Post.  Your conclusion may be correct, but your reasoning is based on the assumption that all functions are linear.  I don&#8217;t like to be square, but that&#8217;s not true.</p>

                                <p>With Republicans frantically clinging to discredited ideology and digging in their heels on raising top marginal tax rates, I thought it would be worth revisiting a post from a couple of years ago, showing some excellent long-term evidence that <strong>higher marginal tax rates are not associated with slower growth. Quite the contrary, in fact.</strong> Here you go:</p>
<p>Mike Kimel once again does yeoman’s duty to compare the two:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/01/tax-rates-v-real-gdp-growth-rates.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FHzoh+%28Angry+Bear%29">Tax Rates v. Real GDP Growth Rates, a Scatter Plot | Angry Bear</a>.</p>
<p>In this post commenter Kaleberg adds a very cool scatterplot.</p>
<p>Each dot is a year (t), compared to another year one to four years later (t+1, t+2, etc.).</p>
<p>Bottom axis is the top marginal tax rate in the starting year. Left axis is annual GDP growth over the ensuing one to four years.</p>
<p><img title="Marginal Rates and GDP Growth" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TT_5n4rT91I/AAAAAAAAAg8/UQj16asciMQ/s400/scatter.bmp" alt="" width="400" height="372"></p>
<p>Starting years from 1929 to 2008.</p>
<p>With everything trending up and to the right, <strong>it sure looks like higher marginal rates and faster growth go together</strong>. But it’s hard to eyeball these kinds of things, so I pulled correlations. For ending years t+1 through t+4:</p>
<p>0.27 0.28 0.28 0.27</p>
<p>I also dropped in Real GDP/Capita in place of Real GDP. Of course the growth rates are slightly lower — the population (the denominator) was growing. But the graph looks basically the same.</p>
<p>Here are the correlations with marginal tax rate — also lower, but darn close:</p>
<p>0.23 0.23 0.23 0.21</p>
<p>Very consistent.</p>
<p>Short story, there is a statistically significant positive  correlation between marginal tax rates in year X and both GDP and GDP-per-capita growth over ensuing years.</p>
<p>It’s pretty small, but consistent and consistently positive – <strong>a higher marginal tax rate in year X correlates with faster growth over the ensuing four years.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Especially interesting: </strong>this encompasses a <em>huge</em> range of marginal rates — from a low of 28% (’88 through ’90) to highs of 84-94% (1944 to 1963 — when we saw the fastest growth in U.S. history; ’64-’69, the top marginal rate was over 70%).</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the lowest rate since 1928 was 24% — in 1929.</p>

                                <p>This item raised my eyebrows when I saw it. Joshua Tucker at The Monkey Cage points out that <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/11/23/throwing-the-1-under-the-bus-for-the-0-1/">the Republicans are proposing we do exactly that</a>.</p>
<p>The idea (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/23/us/politics/congress-looks-at-ways-to-leave-top-tax-rate-as-is.html?pagewanted=1&#038;_r=0&#038;hp">NYT</a>, emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>…<strong>tax the entire salary earned by those making more than a certain level — $400,000 or so — at the top rate of 35 percent</strong> rather than allowing them to pay lower rates before they reach the target, as is the standard formula.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This to avoid the <em>inevitably</em> apocalyptic increase of the top marginal tax rate by 4.6%, from 35% to 39.6%.</p>
<p>As Tucker points out, this proposal increases the taxes for <em>everybody making >$400K by the same amount</em> –<em> </em>whether their income is $500K or $50 million.</p>
<p>Holding up my thumb and squinting, I’m thinking the extra taxes for those folks would be $50-100K. This would be a massive percentage increase for $400K earners, but a drop in the bucket even for $4-million earners, much less the $40-million crowd.</p>
<p>Avoiding that 4.6% top marginal tax rate increase saves a $20-million earner almost a $1 million a year.</p>
<p>As Tucker also points out, this is a stupendous gift to those who have the means to really give back to elected officials — the donors who can make or break a campaign by signing a single check.</p>
<p>But I’m sure the Republicans haven’t considered that. They’re just trying to do What’s Best for America.</p>

                                <p>by Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>At Frum forum <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/20/republicans-have-a-size-problem.html">Justin Green extensively quotes Jeb Golonkin</a> on how conservatism could be much better if conservatives made specific policy proposals.  Sad but true, almost all of the proposals that have been signed into law are by Barack Obama.  This is not a rare event.  While many conservatives stick to slogans, some try to come up with constructive alternatives to the stimulus (ARRA) and Obamacare (PPACA).  I don&#8217;t remember where to link but the phenomenon of “<em>Obamacare is horrible and we should replace it with Obamacare</em>” is quite common.</p>
<p><strong> Golonkin&#8217;s proposals are in</strong> bold, and then another of my comments follows. Recall that the PPACA is Obamacare and the ARRA is the stimulus bill.</p>
<p>Golonkin&#8217;s problem is that Obama has been there and done that.  Golonkin&#8217;s innovative conservative proposals are mostly existing liberal policies.</p>
<p>Golonkin:  Somewhere along the way, we conservatives stopped innovating and stopped explaining, preferring instead to fall back to “small government is better.” Well, maybe it is and maybe it is not. But the notion that government is always useless simply does not ring true in a world where people look to the government to provide Medicare, a national defense, FEMA relief, and public education. This being the case, we would do well to start probing for specific policy solutions that affect people in concrete ways. What is the government doing that is hurting small businesses today? What is the government not doing that it could be that could help small businesses? </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br /> It is not now organizing health insurance exchanges to remove big businesses advantage in insuring employees, because big business work forces are automatically large pools of policy holders helping big but not small businesses interacting with health insurers avoid the adverse selection death spiral.  It would also be nice, above and beyond the call of eliminating a market failure, to offer them subsidies.  See &#8216;healthcare fiasco&#8217;.</p>
<p>Golonkin: <em>What about student debt?</em> </p>
<p> How about ceasing to pay banks huge amounts of money to handle simple paper work and divide the savings between reducing the federal deficit and reducing the amount students have to pay on their debt.  See &#8216;healthcare fiasco&#8217;</p>
<p>Golonkin: Can we use student loan forgiveness as a way to incentivize bright young people to enter particular fields? We need more primary care physicians if we are going to make this healthcare fiasco work. No one wants to be a primary care physician because primary care physicians get paid less than specialists, which makes it harder for them to pay off their medical school debts. But could we change the way the government reimburses primary care? And couldn’t we partially forgive student loans if borrowers agree to enter into primary care in particular markets for a certain number of years?</p>
<p> See &#8216;healthcare fiasco&#8217; and click http://bit.ly/Y6ObIP (warning a *.doc will download)<br />So far all of the bright innovating conservative ideas are provisions of the &#8216;healthcare fiasco&#8217;.  Some are not current policy because they are scheduled to start in January 2014, but mr &#8216;specifics specifics specifics&#8217; didn&#8217;t let that little detail prevent him from arguing that a bill which is largely not yet being applied and of which he demonstrates astonishing ignorance is a &#8216;fiasco&#8217;.  </p>
<p>Golonkin:  <em>What about tax policy: why are we not on the cutting edge of hyper-targeted tax cuts that we can show, with numbers, turbocharge the economy?       </em>     A wish is not a plan.  Wishing that conservatives can show, with numbers, that there are tax cuts that turbocharge the economy doesn&#8217;t make it possible.  There are many conservative academic economists who have looked very hard for proof that some sort of tax cuts turbocharge the economy.  They haven&#8217;t shown this, because it is not true.  yes many conservatives consider numbers foreign alien and un-American (especially arabic numbers).  However there are also conservatives who love numbers and are statistical and mathematical geniuses.  The reason they haven&#8217;t shown with numbers how wonderful tax cuts can be is that it is impossible to show something false with numbers.  The high respect of &#8216;numbers&#8217; is for their power as tools for convincing people.  </p>
<p>Golonkin doesn&#8217;t need to look at any numbers to be sure it is possible to show with numbers that some tax cuts are great.  This is not the way anyone who knows what data are talks about it.  Conservatives, including Golonkin, have the very serious problem of thinking they know the answer before looking at the evidence.   <br />Also I fear that Golonkin believes his hyper targeted tax cut proposal is pro market.  It is, in fact, based on his conviction that policy makers (provided they are conservative) can guess better than the market and wisely subsidize particular activities. The pro market position is that tax rates should not be targeted but rather that the playing field should be level.</p>
<p>Golonkin:  Why are we not demanding that the government rebuild our cratering infrastructure rather than using taxpayer dollars to invest in projects it hopes will succeed (Solyndra)?<br /><strong></strong>  </p>
<p>Yes how about spending more on infrastructure ?  Nothing like the ARRA but spending on infrastructure.  How did Golonkin manage to avoid the phrase &#8216;shovel ready&#8217; ?  He is now calling for the ARRA.  Also he doesn&#8217;t recognize that hyper targeted tax cuts are using taxpayer dollars to invest in etc.  It doesn&#8217;t matter if the money is called a tax cut or a subsidy or even the market value of a CDS (loan guarantee) as in the case of Solyndra.  The policy he advocates and the policy he mocks are implementations of the exact same reasoning.</p>
<p>Golonkin:  Why are we not pushing pay for performance in the healthcare system AND in our education system? </p>
<p> Pay for performance in the healthcare system.  See &#8216;healthcare fiasco&#8217; and click   <br />http://www.lifehealthpro.com/2011/04/29/ppaca-hhs-starts-medicare-performance-payment-syst    <br />pay for performance in education recall the ARRA and google &#8216;race to the top&#8217;    </p>
<p>Golonkin: Workfare?<br />    <br />Workfare was introduced under Reagan and tightened later.  This is the system before the welfare reform of 1996.  It was learned that it costs more to give welfare recipients money and make them work than to just give them money so states backslid and it never amounted to much.  It is an experiment that all agree failed.</p>
<p>Golonkin: Some of these ideas are useless, some of them might have legs, but the point is: specifics, specifics, specifics.</p>
<p> So we see what happens when a conservative tries to think of constructive policy proposals.  There is the wish that conservative claims be &#8216;shown with numbers&#8217; plus Obama policy after Obama policy after Obama policy.  </p>
<p>I think Golonkin should spend more time and effort on understanding the enemy. He might discover that the enemy is not the enemy but rather what he dreams conservatism might one day become.</p>
<p>The shocking thing is that this pathetic display of ignorance is described as &#8220;particularly fine work&#8221; by non movement conservative <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/markadomanis/">Mark Adomanis</a> in Forbes in a post entitled <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2012/11/21/epistemic-closure-in-action-at-national-review-before-dismissing-krugman-you-need-to-read-him/">&#8220;Epistemic Closure in Action &#8230;&#8221;</a><br />Golonkin is not the example of epistemic closure.  He is considered a &#8220;particularly fine&#8221; example of how some conservatives are working to overcome epistemic closure.  The detail that the conservative in question has new conservatives ideas which are almost all either in the PPACA or the ARRA and that he doesn&#8217;t know this, does not make the Galonkin essay an example of epistemic closure.  <br />Rather it is an example of how some conservatives are trying to overcome it and understand liberals before denouncing us.  </p>
<p>I am tempted to type &#8220;pathetic&#8221; but I don&#8217;t pity them, I fear them. They are very numerous and their blind ideological arrogance makes them dangerous.</p>
<p>Note, the two conservatives in question are Green and Golonkin.</p>
