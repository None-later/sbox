                                <p>You have to love Chris Christie. The man who <a href="http://www.examiner.com/essex-county-conservative-in-newark/arc-tunnel-cancelled-reaction-predictable">said NJ couldn&#8217;t afford a tunnel whose <em>cost with overruns</em> was expected to be less than $10B</a> is now <a href="http://www.examiner.com/essex-county-conservative-in-newark/christie-claims-vindication-on-gateway-tunnel-project">backing a tunnel</a> <a href="http://www.examiner.com/essex-county-conservative-in-newark/two-nj-senators-pushing-new-trans-hudson-tunnel-project">whose <em>initial cost estimate</em> is $13B</a>.</p>
<p>That the great state of New Jersey <a href="http://holt.house.gov/">has sent an actual physicist to Congress</a>, let alone supplies and hosts most of the talent in the Pharmaceutical and Financial Services industry,* and is run by a man who says we couldn&#8217;t afford $10.5B that PATH would control but should give $13B to something Amtrak will continue to control is rather close to proof that G-d is either non-existent or a thug with a sick sense of humor.</p>
<p>And now, he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/nj-governor-christie-vetoes-bill-that-would-fund-planned-parenthood/">saving money again</a> (h/t <a href="http://whiskeyfire.typepad.com/whiskey_fire/2011/02/turn-to-dust-and-so-i-think-she-must.html">Thers</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Bill A3273 would have expanded New Jerseys’ Medicaid program, essentially reversing action Christie took in July 2010 to ensure <strong>$7.5 million</strong> in taxpayer money would not go to supporting family planning clinics, most of which [29 of 58 is half, not &#8220;most,&#8221; but apparently conservative reporters can&#8217;t do math either] are run by Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Fiscal year 2012, it is anticipated that the state’s Medicaid program faces a budget shortfall of <strong>$1.1 billion</strong>,&#8221; said Governor Christie in a statement. <em>Expanding Medicaid to more people &#8220;does not make sense from an overall fiscal and health care policy perspective</em>,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Words can confuse numbers, so let me, er, &#8220;spell this one out.&#8221;<br /><a name="more"></a><br />In Christie-world, not spending $7,500,000 upfront is going to solve a deficit of $1,100,000,000. Those three extra zeroes on the deficit number are, after all, an Arabic creation, and can be ignored if you&#8217;re a blithering idiot or a Republican governor.**</p>
<p>Ignoring, of course, that an increase in conceptions and undesired births, combined with a decline in available prenatal care will lead to more <a href="http://www.mylot.com/w/discussions/1559964.aspx">underweight</a>, <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20050120/ai_n10044077/">premature</a>, <a href="http://www.indiaparenting.com/pregnancy/122_3033/importance-of-a-healthy-diet.html">under- and malnourished</a> babies that will grow up to require more services than they would have had they been healthy and/or desired.</p>
<p>In Christie-world&mash;<a href="http://whereschristie.com/">that&#8217;s where you go, remaining out of touch</a>, knowing that your Lieutenant Governor is visiting her dying father out of the country, so that <a href="http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/12/27/chris-christie-leaves-snow-democratic-governor-behind-new-jersey#">the Senate president is left to declare a State of Emergency</a>—proper prenatal care doesn&#8217;t pay for itself.</p>
<p>In Christie-world, being <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/red-lining-blue-states.html">the state most tasked with subsidizing the Red States</a> enables one to position to quit and run for higher office.*** Or at least that&#8217;s the only simple, direct, &#8220;rational&#8221; explanation for not investing in human capital and spending more on a less-desirable project.</p>
<p>If Chris Christie isn&#8217;t planning to be a short-timer, he&#8217;s certainly making certain that his legacy will be one of higher debt and lower preparedness. The next generation of New Jerseyites may be as innumerate as he is.</p>
<p>In which case, who do the Blue Staters think will pay for all their wars and welfare?</p>
<p>*Non-hedge fund financial services talent, that is. They generally <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/red-lining-blue-states.html">live and work in Connecticut</a>, from which they pillage with impunity.</p>

<p>***I would say this is part-wishful thinking on my part, but the result would be a mix of Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin appearing regularly on CNN or Faux News while—in the grand tradition of previous budget pillager and &#8220;centrist&#8221; Christine Todd Whitman—the rest of us are left to clean up the mess.</p>

<p>As I noted in an earlier posting, the IRS has continued its focus on secret offshore bank accounts. Naturally, the media covers this issue for their wealthy readers who are following the IRS&#8217;s every action in this matter. See, e.g., Paul Sullivan, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/05/your-money/taxes/05wealth.html">Hiding Money Overseas? You&#8217;re Taking a Big Chance</a>, NYTimes, Feb. 4, 2010. </p>
<p>Sullivan runs through the ways that it has become riskier to hide accounts, as Wikileaks now has indicated that it plans a release of additional names provided by a whistleblower. It&#8217;s not just whistleblowers that secret account holders need to worry about, of course. Jilted lovers, business competitors, disgruntled employees&#8211;anyone who knows about the account could turn into a whistleblower for personal reasons, with the whistleblower reward just icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Sullivan reminds us that keeping money offshore isn&#8217;t illegal in itself; rather, it is the failure to report and pay taxes on the income according to US tax laws that is the illegal activity. Some of those caught by the law are unintentional scofflaws. Sullivan runs through the various reasons that someone may end up facing a penalty for an offshore account even though they had no intention of using the account to evade tax laws, such as beneficiaries of Holocaust survivors who had moved assets into Swiss banks to escape Nazi confiscation.</p>
<p>For the evaders, Sullivan talks about their &#8220;risk&#8221; of getting caught and their risk of paying significant penalties. But what seems to be missing from Sullivan&#8217;s account is any real sense of disgust for those who do intentionally decide to evade their income tax responsibilities. That&#8217;s quite likely criminal fraud.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media: Is the Boss a Bleep?</strong></p>
<p>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) forced a settlement on American Medical Response of Connecticut Inc. after AMR fired an employee (and Teamsters member) who went home from work and profanely blasted her supervisor as being mentally ill on Facebook. Other employees posted responses supporting the employee.</p>
<p>The law protects the free discussion of working terms and conditions, and concerted activity, even in a crude and lewd manner in a public Internet space.</p>
<p>AMR agreed to loosen its Internet policies and a confidential settlement was reached with the former employee.</p>
<p>Since the employee posted from her home computer the issue of social media use on the job was not addressed, but it is another thorny problem.</p>
<p>In reviewing more than a dozen news reports, various attorneys had weighed in on the impacts of this ruling . It is likely we will need more cases to get a better definition of the boundaries, and there is no indication the ruling contradicts various laws protecting patient and customer privacy, intellectual property or prohibiting the dissemination of insider information. No indication how this might mesh with slander and defamation laws.</p>
<p>The NLRB announced the results of its settlement &#8211; on its Facebook page &#8211; of course.</p>

<p>Medical Malpractice Reform: Truth in Advertising Needed (Part One of Three)</p>
</p>
<p>Medical malpractice liability reform (Tort Reform) has been a hotly contested item for years, as the GOP, with physician support, has continued to market this as a health reform measure that can contain costs.</p>
<p>I think to start, we need to examine results in states where tort reform has already been tried. We need look no further than Texas. </p>
<p>Politicians tried to claim that Texas was a success, Rep Bachmann stated ““The state of Texas did a wonderful job of lawsuit reform and actually saw medical costs come down. We know it works.” Others have touted the Texas experiment as a success..but empiric data is a powerful thing, and as we will see, contradicts this sentiment.</p>
<p>In 2003, they passed the most aggressive tort reform measures in the country by placing a 250,000 cap on malpractice awards. It is true that this reform, after 2003, lowered malpractice premiums. But malpractice settlements and awards have dropped even farther than premiums, suggesting that the main benefactors so far, have been insurance companies. (See Table 1).</p>
<p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQkoV430I/AAAAAAAAAiE/4bl1MtYMNAU/s1600-h/clip_image002%5B3%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image002" border="0" alt="clip_image002" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQk2l4tcI/AAAAAAAAAiI/RiOFx5FyfNk/clip_image002_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="244" height="194"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p>Also, the same report found that Medicare spending per patient had doubled between 2003 and 2007, in contrast to the decline in Medicare spending that was noted prior to the laws enactment. (See Table 2)</p>
<p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQlPQguLI/AAAAAAAAAiM/f3G3hFVkFdQ/s1600-h/clip_image004%5B3%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image004" border="0" alt="clip_image004" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQlBRGeWI/AAAAAAAAAiQ/RyWggAlEifI/clip_image004_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="244" height="186"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQlQu1K0I/AAAAAAAAAiU/Q8PlkM2rcJw/s1600-h/clip_image006%5B3%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image006" border="0" alt="clip_image006" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQlj6QVuI/AAAAAAAAAiY/fX5wRYeURrQ/clip_image006_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="244" height="12"></a></p>
<p>Additionally, one of the strongest arguments that tort reform supporters claim is a reduction in “defensive” medicine expenditures, or unnecessary testing… unfortunately, between 2003 and 2007 testing expenditures per Medicare enrollee grew at 50% greater than the national average…</p>
<p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQl1hqcQI/AAAAAAAAAic/XM_-d5Uy-3Q/s1600-h/clip_image008%5B3%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image008" border="0" alt="clip_image008" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQlwZPBtI/AAAAAAAAAig/TJ9B660hgBs/clip_image008_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="244" height="194"></a></p>
<p>They also found that Texas has the highest rate of uninsured patients in the country, both prior to the law, and accelerating after the law was passed.</p>
<p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQmSgu54I/AAAAAAAAAik/jhs_ud8iJlM/s1600-h/clip_image010%5B3%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image010" border="0" alt="clip_image010" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQmpEs6mI/AAAAAAAAAio/L0CClLl3NVw/clip_image010_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="244" height="164"></a></p>
<p>The additional physician presence has only increased because of an increasing population as well, and when it was analyzed, there was only an increase of 0.4 (correction&#8230;0.4%) physicians per capita after the law was passed. </p>
<p>These tables and data were all obtained and detailed in this study HERE, and there is much more information at the link. (enclosed link: <a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/Texas_Liability_Limits.pdf">http://www.citizen.org/documents/Texas_Liability_Limits.pdf</a>). </p>
<p>The short version is that medical malpractice reform should be a topic for discussion, but we need to be honest about this. In this article we reviewed what actually happened in Texas after the most aggressive tort reform measures were created. Costs (outside of settlements, payments, and premiums did NOT go down), and healthcare spending was at best unaffected, and may have even increased. </p>
<p>The next article will focus on the effects of reducing defensive medicine practices on patient mortality. The final article will focus on the association between medical malpractice premiums and healthcare spending.</p>

<p><strong>Laurence Tribe on the ACA … and the Supreme Court justices</strong></p>
<p>Argggh. In rereading my comment from yesterday to Bruce’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/02/health-care-aca-act-who-does-roberts.html">“Health Care ACA Act: Who does the Roberts Court Work For?”</a> post, I realized that there’s a major part of my comment that’s, well, missing: the part that explains why I started out saying that the potential conflict between the pro-business Republicans and the Tea Baggers, and therefore between the business-interests-first justices and the Tea Party justices, appears more significant than it actually is, but ended up predicting that business-proxy Roberts and anti-libertarian Alito indeed would part company with Tea Partiers Scalia and Thomas and vote to uphold the insurance mandate. </p>
<p>OK, well, I was in a hurry when I wrote that post. Today I’m not in a hurry, and I was going to post a comment explaining how I got from Z to A. But it turns out that eminent Harvard constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe did that for me, in an op-ed piece today in the New York Times: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/opinion/08tribe.html?_r=1">On Health Care, Justice Will Prevail</a>.</p>
<p>(Dan here&#8230;The prestigious <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/02/wednesday-round-up-70/">Scotusblog</a> makes mention of Beverly&#8217;s post on the Supreme Court justices in its roundup.)<br /><a name="more"></a> </p>
<p>Tribe explains, as I should have but did not, that a new Supreme Court precedent on the breadth of Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause, via the Necessary and Proper Clause, of the sort that would be necessary to invalidate the insurance mandate in the ACA, also would establish grounds to invalidate a slew of federal laws, current ones and potential ones, that Scalia and Alito like, particularly criminal laws of the sort that the Court upheld in a 2005 opinion written by Scalia and joined by Alito (uphold a law making it illegal to grow marijuana on your own property for your own use rather than for sale in interstate commerce), but also—although Tribe doesn’t mention this—laws such as the one requiring 18-years to register with the Selective Service. </p>
<p>The authority for the Selective Service law is the Constitution’s “provide for the common defense” Clause rather than the Commerce clause, but the main objection to the ACA’s insurance mandate is, as Judge Vinson put it, that it compels activity by those who want to opt for inactivity. If that’s a problem under the Commerce Clause paired with the Necessary and Proper Clause, why wouldn’t it be problem under the Common Defense Clause when paired with the Necessary and Proper Clause? </p>
<p>But Tribe and I part company in predicting what Scalia will do, mainly because we part company in our view of the intellectual integrity of the justices, and probably of judges in general. </p>
<p>To imagine that Justice Scalia would abandon the fundamental understanding of the Constitution’s necessary and proper clause that he expressed six years ago in the marijuana case, because he was appointed by a Republican president, is to insult both his intellect and his integrity, Tribe says. Well, his integrity anyway. As would imagine that Justice Scalia would abandon the fundamental understanding of the Constitution’s necessary and proper clause that he expressed six years ago in the marijuana case, because he is a Tea Party fave would, too. </p>
<p>And as several commentators have pointed out recently, Scalia indicated recently in a dissent from the Court’s refusal to hear a particular case, that’s likely what he’ll do. Only Thomas, who dissented from Scalia’s opinion in the marijuana case in 2005, also dissented from that recent refusal to hear that other case. </p>
<p>Tribe’s umbrage that legal commentators are expressing their expectation that the Court will divide 5-4 along ideological lines in deciding whether the mandate in the ACA is constitutional makes my skin crawl. Tribe, some of y’all may recall, was Al Gore’s Supreme Court advocate in Bush v. Gore. His point that the ACA opinion will not—could not—be a ruling good for that case only is spot-on. Which is why I think Roberts and Alito will vote to uphold the mandate. “My bet—not the ranch, but let’s say a nickel—is that Roberts and even Alito will vote to uphold the mandate,” is how I ended my post comment to Bruce’s post yesterday. </p>
<p>But Tribe knows well that it is only for that reason—that the ACA case, unlike Bush v. Gore, cannot be limited to that case only, and that an opinion invalidating the insurance mandate as beyond the reach of the Necessary and Proper Clause, would have repercussions that some of the Federalist Society justices wouldn’t be happy about—that those justices may vote to uphold the insurance mandate. For that reason, Scalia may have second thoughts and vote to uphold it; it won’t be because his intellectual integrity is impeccable.</p>
<p>Just as Tribe’s fawning over Scalia and the other justices has everything to do with Tribe’s ongoing Supreme Court practice, and nothing to do with his opinion of the intellectual or personal integrity of the justices.</p>

                                <p>Only rarely do I think that Kevin Drum would benefit from having studied economics more in college.  He almost always seems to understand economics issues better than most professional economists.  </p>
<p>Therefore I jump on an error, which, I suspect must be very widespread if Drum made it.  </p>
<p>He wrote</p>
<blockquote><p>the contribution of the airline industry to GDP probably hasn&#8217;t changed an awful lot since 1973. But its contribution to the increased wellbeing of the median person has increased tremendously. In 1973, the average schmoe simply never flew: it was too expensive and flights weren&#8217;t always very convenient. Today, nearly anyone can afford to fly at least occasionally. So this is one area where pure measures of GDP probably understate the benefit to the median person.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually no.  It is one area where the pure measure of GDP isn&#8217;t quite that simple.<br />When we try to use the growth of GDP per capita to get some hint of benefit to the median person, we look at real GDP.  Drum&#8217;s guess is that the huge increase in the volume of services provided by the airline industry and the huge increase in the price multiply out to agrowth in dollars of value added similar to the growth of overall nominal GDP.  For the sake of argument, I will pretend that the share of airline value added in GDP is exactly the same now as it was in 1973.</p>
<p>This absolutely does not imply that the contribution of the airline industry to measured real &#8220;pure GDP&#8221; growth is average.  That&#8217;s not how it&#8217;s done.  The BEA calculates the growth nominal value added by sector.  It calculates the change in a value added deflator by sector (often it&#8217;s pretty much made up).  It calculates the growth of real value added by sector.  Then it takes an average weighted by the shares of the sectors in GDP.  Rapid growth of volume of a sector and rapid decline in prices implies rapid measured growth of real value added which contributes a lot to measured real GDP growth. Nominal value added in a sector can shrink compared to GDP and yet the sector can contribute more than the average sector to GDP growth.</p>
<p>Another way of looking at it is Real GDP is nominal GDP divided by a price index &#8212; the gDP deflator.  The GDP deflator is a weighted average of lots of prices, including <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/pce_deflators_faq_new_stub.xls">E1AIT1</a> (*.xls warning)</p>
<p>Air transportation  E1AIT1 PPI Domestic scheduled passenger air transportation</p>
<p>   The airline industry may have made an average contribution to the growth of nominal GDP, but the low increase (or decrease) of E1AIT1 caused the growth of the estimated GDP deflator growth to be low and estimated read GDP growth to be high.</p>
<p>Real pure GDP estimates ignore practically everything but sure don&#8217;t ignore prices.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is my last post and I want to thank Jim and Justin [Miller, of the Atlantic web team] for the wonderful opportunity to be a guest blogger.  It has been a fun gig, but quite frankly I am running out of steam.  But life is an interplay of chance and necessity, and serendipity has just offered up a chance for a final blast.<br />For several years now, I have been in a analytical battle with an official in the Department of Defense over the question of whether Republicans or Democrats are better for the economy. <a name="more"></a><br />Newk A. Mineshaftgap is the pseudonym of a senior career official in the Pentagon, with a civilian rank comparable to that of a general in the military. He must remain anonymous for policy reasons &#8212; to borrow from the insightful reasoning used by President Merkin Muffley in Dr. Strangelove,  Minesthaftgap cannot get into a policy fight, because he works in the &#8220;the war room.&#8221;<br />I can tell you this: Newk has a PhD in physics, but he is not a geek.  In fact, he is a bit of polymath, with wide ranging interests, including nuclear weapons, ballistic missile defense, battleship and tank design, global warming and carbon default swaps, economics, and the development of metrics for measuring the quality of medical doctors.   I have known Newk for about 20 years and consider him to be a good and most interesting friend with solid if somewhat eccentric instincts.  Politically, I would categorize Newk as an independent with libertarian biases.<br />So, as my last blast, let me offer the <a href="http://www.chaliventures.com/Links_to_Reports/Links_to_Idisk_files/Are%20Republicans%20or%20Democrats%20Better%20for%20the%20Economy%3F.pdf">following link</a> [PDF]  to Newk&#8217;s latest report on whether Republicans or Democrats are better for the economy.  For a knuckle dragger from the Pentagon, his conclusions might surprise you.<br />___

<blockquote><p>Ragu Rajan &#8230; his explanation of why economists didn’t predict the crisis:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would argue that three factors largely explain our collective failure: specialization, the difficulty of forecasting, and the disengagement of much of the profession from the real world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rajan glosses a leading alternative hypothesis thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Finally, an answer that is gaining ground is that the system bribed economists to stay silent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously bribe-based theories of human behavior are crude and rarely capture reality. But how about translating this into economics? How about incentives? Rajan says it’s not individual corruption that led to a lack of insight, it’s structure features of the way the profession is organized. That makes a lot of sense to me. But what explains that structural organization? Is it really unrelated to the financial basis of the economics profession? Or are economists supposed to be immune from the factors that influence human behavior in other instances?</p></blockquote>
<p>I comment</p>
<p>I will try to guess if the system is bribed to stay silent.  I am technically an economist, but not part of the system (that is not an elite economist).  To start with my conclusion, I don&#8217;t think that the blindness of elite economists can be explained as a rational or semi rational response to incentives.  I think that Rajan happens to be right about what went wrong this time.  </p>
<p>I explain why I believe this after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Very few economists saw it coming (and they might have just guessed right or strategically made an extreme prediction which is like buying a lottery ticket).  I&#8217;d say two things blinded economists, the EMH and DSGE (acronyms explained below).  Neither was paid for by firms or rich individuals.</p>
<p>First the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) which holds that all assets always sell for the same price they would have if everyone had rational expectations.  Basically it says there are no bubbles even in housing *and* that if there is a housing bubble then mortgage bonds and CDOs of mortgage bonds and CDSs on CDOs of morgage bonds are all correctly prices.  Clearly no advocate of the EMH could see it coming. </p>
<p>For some reason, the EMH remains the default position of many academic economists.  Worse, one exception at a time is allowed, so people see if one asset is correctly priced assuming all other assets are correctly priced.  There is no way this approach could lead to a prediction that the recent crisis was even possible.</p>
<p>Also, iit would be a total catastrophic disaster for the financial services industry if the general investing public believed the EMH.   If anyone took it seriously when investing (as opposed to when writing academic articles) then the financial services industry couldn&#8217;t make much money dealing with that person.  If one believes in the EMH and doesn&#8217;t have private information (not a strategy or algorithm or theory but knowledge of relevant facts which almost no one knows) then one should buy and hold the market portfolio.  This means low trading volume and low fees.  This means you buy equal amounts of all tranches of CDOs (except you already have the pool of underlying assets so you don&#8217;t bother).  This means you don&#8217;t pay someone to manage your money unless that person has private information.</p>
<p>The Financial services Industry makes its huge profits at the expense of suckers who think they can beat the market.  Partly by charging them fees and partly by betting against them (since the EMH is false financial professionals can make money with simple rules).  Belief in the EMH would kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.</p>
<p>Yet academic economists have been promoting the EMH for decades.  This just couldn&#8217;t be the effect of being bribed *or* of some indirect influence of group interests on sincere beliefs or anything.  The bought off hypothesis just doesn&#8217;t fit the facts.</p>
<p>The use of DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) models also guarantees failure to see it coming.  It also has nothing to do with consulting.  There is a sharp devision between academic macroeconomics and macroeconomic forecasting.  It is done by different people.  Some people are paid for forecasts.  Clearly they have all sorts of interesting incentives which have been analysed at gruesome length by <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/qjecon/v111y1996i1p21-40.html">academic economists who, contra Yglesias, pay attention to incentives of forecasters</a>.  They don&#8217;t use DSGE models.  They missed it too, but they aren&#8217;t the people Rajan was writing about.  As far as I know, there is no rich or concentrated group which promotes DSGE models.  People who pay macroeconomists pay completely different macroeconomists who do completely different things.  They don&#8217;t know or care what DSGE stands for.</p>
<p>I may be overstating my claim.  It may be that DSGE models tweaked to give the same forecasts as atheoretic models are used.  But no one has an interest in paying the middle man (the tweaked theory).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the way in which money has influence economics is by promoting in general a right wing slant (compared to view best supported by the evidence).  Many prominent economists are very right wing. If asked, they advise people to vote for Republicans.   Now I note that US economists are on average a bit to the left of the US center (the general academic thing beats the field specific thing).  My view that the profession is slanted right compared to the evidence just means I am to the left of most of the profession.</p>
<p>In any case this has almost nothing to do with missing the warning signs.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care: Cameras in the Delivery Room?</strong></p>
<p>In the old days the delivery of a baby was a medical procedure and dad was relegated to the waiting room. Then we went all new age, and the delivery became a tribal event.</p>
<p>Now we seem to have reached a nice middle ground with comfortable birthing suites and a more balanced emphasis on the medical procedure and the &#8220;event.&#8221;</p>
<p>But then there are the ubiquitous video and cell phone cameras and suddenly the event is shared through the family, or yes shared with the whole world on Youtube.</p>
<p>The dad-as-cameraman creates various dilemmas, such as getting in the way, or when the birth turns complicated or when mom decides she really does not want her screaming or a picture of her mommy zone to be broadcast at the next family reunion.  Some staff are less than pleased about being included in home movies.</p>
<p>Some hospitals are banning video photography. Families respond that hospitals are afraid of malpractice suits.  The battle rages. Your thoughts?</p>
<p>(Some physicians are now providing surgery patients with videos of &#8220;scopic&#8221;  procedures such a knee meniscus repairs, or DVDs with MRI images.  Interesting viewing.)</p>
