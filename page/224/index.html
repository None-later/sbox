<p><strong>Justifying Progressive Tax Rates</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=391">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>The Atlantic&#8217;s website carries a blog by a conservative/libertarian who writes very well on a wide variety of topics, and who sometimes covers economic issues with great insight.  Of course, I&#8217;m talking about Andrew Sullivan.  (What, you didn&#8217;t think&#8230;  of course not.  Don&#8217;t be ridiculous.)</p>
<p>A smart writer &#8211; even one you don&#8217;t always agree with &#8211; also has smart readers.  (Of course, the flip side is that a clueless writer who gets the facts wrong all the time also has clueless readers who get the facts wrong all the time.)  Here&#8217;s a bit of a letter one of Sullivan&#8217;s readers readers sent him, reproduced on Sullivan&#8217;s <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2011/03/inequality-and-the-right-ctd.html">blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m a bit late with this, but I wanted to respond to <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2011/03/inequality-and-the-right.html">your post yesterday</a> in which you wrote:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;To many on the right, this inequality is a non-issue, and in an abstract sense, I agree. Penalizing people for their success does not help the less successful.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at this issue another way: A homeowner who owns a $1 million home will pay more for insurance than will the owner of a $200,000 home. The insurer is not penalizing the first homeowner for his success. The first homeowner simply has more to lose and therefore pays more. If you believe the core function of government is to provide a stable environment (physical, financial, legal, social) in which society can flourish, the wealthy have more to lose from government&#8217;s absence. Penalizing the successful wouldn&#8217;t help anyone. Underwriting the successful costs money.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later in the post, Sullivan goes on to inadvertently disrespect <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=241">Hauser&#8217;s Law</a>.  Sullivan&#8217;s blog is not an &#8220;econ blog&#8221; but I think it has better economic insights than a lot of blogs that are, even if I often disagree with his politics.</p>

                                <p>Events 150 years ago should be remembered in 2011.  A large re-enactment of scenes of the battle  is planned for Gettysburg 1-3 July 2013.  There were many event leading up to, and following, the greatest battle fought in the Western Hemisphere and they also should be commemorated.</p>
<p>“11 Mar in 1861 is significant; it is the date that the several states having seceded from the United States began ratifying constitution.  That constitution was ratified in the following manner.”</p>
<p>““March 11, 13, 16, 21, 23, 29, April 3, 22: The Confederate Congress adopts a permanent Constitution of the Confederate States on March 11.[185][202] The then seceded states ratify this constitution on March 13 (Alabama), March 16 (Georgia), March 21 (Louisiana), March 23 (Texas), March 29 (Mississippi), April 3 (South Carolina) and April 22 (Florida).[210] “</p>

<p>The Manhattan Institute is currently gathering nominations for our Hayek Prize, which will honor the book published within the past two years that best reflects F.A. Hayek’s vision of economic and individual liberty. The winner of the Hayek Prize will be given a $50,000 cash award and asked to deliver our annual Hayek Lecture in New York City later this year.</p>
<p>We encourage the nomination of books that advance the ideals of classical liberalism along a range of economic, political, and moral dimensions. Hayek&#8217;s The Road to Serfdom is very much the inspiration and the model for the Prize.</p>
<p>Nominations are due by Friday, March 11, 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Presimetrics</strong> can be nominated by Angry Bear readers.  I know&#8230;.just found it, so thanks.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Federal Reserve released the Q4 2010 <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/Current/">Flow of Funds</a><a href="http://federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/Current/"> Accounts</a> for the US. On the household balance sheet, net worth (total assets minus total liabilities) was estimated at $56.8 trillion, which is up $2.1 trillion over the quarter. Notably, household net worth has increased $6.4 trillion since the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">recession&#8217;s end</a> (Q2 2009). Moreover, personal disposable income increased another $918 billion over the quarter, which dropped household leverage (total liabilities/disposable income) 1.1% to 116%.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0651cF0j2ZQ/TXl1FJ243XI/AAAAAAAADhE/VSPsShwfTeM/s1600/household_leverage.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0651cF0j2ZQ/TXl1FJ243XI/AAAAAAAADhE/VSPsShwfTeM/s400/household_leverage.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Personal saving as a percentage of disposable income rose markedly in Q4 2010 to 10.9% (based on the BEA&#8217;s measurement of saving using flow of funds data &#8211; see <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/Current/z1.pdf">Table F.10, lines 49-52</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8KkgNsSc0sE/TXl3MkpS0tI/AAAAAAAADhM/46B75B3NoQU/s1600/wealth_effect.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8KkgNsSc0sE/TXl3MkpS0tI/AAAAAAAADhM/46B75B3NoQU/s400/wealth_effect.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart above illustrates the the wealth effect &#8211; the wealth effect is the propensity to consume (save) as wealth increases/decreases. In the Flow of Funds data, this is best approximated by the ratio of net worth (wealth) to disposable income. In Q4 2010, wealth rose 0.15 times disposable income to 4.9, while the saving rate surged 6 pps to 10.9%.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I conclude from the near-term times series illustrated above, that the wealth effect is very weak, and the incentive to save outweighs the desire to consume one&#8217;s wealth. Better put: households are increasing consumption, but that&#8217;s due to increased income not wealth.</p>
<p>Of note, since 1997 the volatility of household net worth to disposable income is near 2.5 times that which preceded 1997. Households are fed up; and at least for the time being, the positive wealth effect may be effectively dead.</p>
<p>As an aside, I put something out there: the &#8216;measure&#8217; of saving is becoming increasingly unreliable. Spanning the years 2008-current, the average discrepancy between the Flow of Funds measure of saving and the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=58&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010">BEA&#8217;s measure</a> of the same definition of saving (the NIPA construction) is more than 2 times what it was in the 2 years leading up to the recession. This is worth more investigation; but historically, the FOF measure (the change in net worth) has been more reliable.</p>
<p>Breaking down household assets from liabilities, you see what&#8217;s driven most of the cumulative gain in net worth: financial assets, which are up near 16% since the recession&#8217;s end. During the recovery to Q4 2010, pension fund assets are up 22%; mutual fund holdings gained 32%; and here&#8217;s the Fed&#8217;s baby, corporate equities (stocks) surged 41% (and more, of course, since this data is truncated at December 2010). Credit market instruments are up 6%.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YRBIuEMzP60/TXnQcoHt8fI/AAAAAAAADiE/GdtzhSfxNtY/s1600/household_assets.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YRBIuEMzP60/TXnQcoHt8fI/AAAAAAAADiE/GdtzhSfxNtY/s400/household_assets.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The asset gains outweigh the drop in liabilities, as mortgages and consumer credit have dropped near 4% and 2%, respectively, since the end of the recession. Consumer credit is making a comeback, though, growing 1% over the quarter, while households continue to reduce mortgage liabilities.</p>

<p>I will comment sometime over the weekend or next week about corporate excess saving, which also is constructed using the Flow of Funds data.</p>

<p>Figures on the trade balance and new claims for unemployment insurance are out this morning, and the news isn’t as good as hoped. First, <a href="http://www.workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/press/2011/031011.asp">initial claims increased</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the week ending March 5, the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims was 397,000, an increase of 26,000 from the previous week’s revised figure of 371,000. The 4-week moving average was 392,250, an increase of 3,000 from the previous week’s revised average of 389,250.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a> </p></blockquote>
<p>This level of claims, around 400,000, is near the <a href="http://moneywatch.bnet.com/economic-news/blog/maximum-utility/initital-claims-for-unemployment-fell-last-week-why-should-we-care/1056/">breakeven point</a> between a job market that is creating jobs, and one where jobs are being lost. Thus, these figures, combined with the figures over the last several releases embedded in the four-week average show a job market that is struggling to provide enough jobs just to keep up with population growth, let alone recover the millions of jobs lost during the recession. The trend for claims is in the right direction, and more generally job markets do appear to be improving, but the improvement is frustratingly slow. <a href="http://moneywatch.bnet.com/economic-news/blog/maximum-utility/how-long-until-we-reach-full-employment/1202/">We need the recovery to accelerate substantially</a> if we are going to get back to full employment in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>Second, the trade deficit increased to $46.3 billion in January, an increase of around $6 billion:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, through the Department of Commerce, announced today that total January exports of $167.7 billion and imports of $214.1 billion resulted in a goods and services deficit of $46.3 billion, up from $40.3 billion in December, revised. January exports were $4.4 billion more than December exports of $163.3 billion. January imports were $10.5 billion more than December imports of $203.6 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The jump in the trade deficit exceeded expectations, and was partly due to higher energy prices. In addition, the trade deficit with China increased by 12.5% to a little over $23 billion.</p>
<p>Some have pointed to increased exports and a reduction in the trade balance as one of the keys to recovery. A reduction in the deficit at the end of the last year provided some hope that this was happening, but this report throws cold water on those hopes. And, to make it worse, if energy prices go up any further the foreign sector is likely to pose a drag on an already much too slow recovery.</p>

Reposted.
<p>After claiming repeatedly in the media that the fight to end public worker bargaining rights was all about the budget, Governor Walker stripped the collective bargaining provisions out of the budget (which required the participation of at least one Democrat to have a big enough quorum to satisfy Constitutional requirements for fiscal votes) and the Wisconsin legislature passed it separately. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Details from <a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2011/03/09/anti-public-employee-bill-passes-senate-in-wisconsin-only-the-beginning-of-the-fight/">David Dayen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’ve been following along in my last post, you know the news: the Wisconsin State Senate rushed through and passed a bill that strips collective bargaining rights from most public employees. The vote in the State Senate, entirely composed of Republicans, was 18-1; only moderate Dale Schultz voted no. The budget repair bill was split at the last minute, cleaving the “non-fiscal” anti-union piece from the fiscal components of the bill. The non-fiscal piece did not require a quorum, so the Senate was able to pass it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may not pass muster constitutionally in Wisconsin. Here is the germane language:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vote on fiscal bills; quorum. SECTION 8. On the passage in either house of the legislature of any law which imposes, continues or renews a tax, or creates a debt or charge, or makes, continues or renews an appropriation of public or trust money, or releases, discharges or commutes a claim or demand of the state, the question shall be taken by yeas and nays, which shall be duly entered on the journal; and three−fifths of all the members elected to such house shall in all such cases be required to constitute a quorum therein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The language may seem ambiguous (claim of rather than claim on?). But there is likely to be precedent, and if not, the Court would look to the debates at the time the constitution was passed, to resolve the question of intent. It is very likely that the concerns expressed then would extend to both sides of the fiscal equation, that is, tax collection and disbursements, which would thus include obligations like employee contracts. </p>
<p>And Walker said repeatedly that the collective bargaining matter was fiscal. In modern contracts, you often have language in the agreement to exclude the headings from any interpretation. The Constitution would not have such language. So the “fiscal” in the heading would be included in any effort to parse the meaning. </p>
<p>But since the Supreme Court has a Republican majority, that would seem to cast a pall over challenges. But Supreme Court elections are on April 5, and the unions have a lot of support in the state. This bill passage (getting it through the Assembly is guaranteed) is subject to legal challenges not only on Constitutional but also on the basis of violating legislative procedures. And there is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MikeElk/status/45644514425176064">talk of a general strike</a>, something which if you had asked me two months ago, I would have deemed to be pretty much impossible in America. They may be permissible if spontaneous, as in bottom up rather than called by union leadership. </p>
<p>Some details of the official version from<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/09/AR2011030900299.html?wpisrc=nl_natlalert"> the Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans in the Wisconsin Senate voted Wednesday night to strip nearly all collective bargaining rights from public workers after discovering a way to bypass the chamber’s missing Democrats….</p>
<p>The Senate requires a quorum to take up any measures that spend money. But Republicans on Wednesday split from the legislation the proposal to curtail union rights, which spends no money, and a special conference committee of state lawmakers approved the bill a short time later.</p>
<p>The lone Democrat present on the conference committee, Rep. Tony Barca, shouted that the surprise meeting was a violation of the state’s open meetings law but Republicans voted over his objections. The Senate then convened within minutes and passed it without discussion or debate.</p>
<p>Spectators in the gallery screamed “You are cowards.”</p>
<p>Before the sudden votes, Democratic Sens. Bob Jauch said if Republicans “chose to ram this bill through in this fashion, it will be to their political peril. They’re changing the rules. They will inflame a very frustrated public.”</p>

                                <p>There&#8217;s been a rather silly news item floating around the internets and business press today about the role of government in the US economy. Here&#8217;s an example from the Investors Business Daily:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/565496/201103091841/Atlas-Twitches.htm"><strong>Is America Becoming A Welfare Nation?</strong> </a></p>
<p>More than one-third of all wages and salaries in this country are actually government handouts. We should be alarmed that we&#8217;ve become a nation of dependents.</p>
<p>Using data mined from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, TrimTabs Investment Research has found that 35% of wages and salaries this year will be in the form of a government payment. That&#8217;s up sharply from 2000, when it was 21%, which is more than double the rate — 10% — of 1960.</p>
<p>The payouts are primarily Social Security and Medicare benefits, and unemployment checks. But they are not limited to those programs.</p>
<p>In any case, we&#8217;re seeing before us a disturbing trend. A society can&#8217;t survive moving in this direction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sigh. Where to begin.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />First of all, just to set the record straight: the press is reporting the numbers wrong. The true figure, according to the BEA data, is that about 18% of personal income in 2010 was in the form of transfer payments from the government. Meanwhile, exactly zero percent of wages and salaries were in the form of transfer payments, because wages and salaries were, well, wages and salaries. I suspect that many people are conflating &#8220;wages and salaries&#8221; with &#8220;personal income&#8221; as they report this statistic. But there&#8217;s actually a big difference, and wages and salaries actually make up only a bit more than half of personal income in the US.</p>
<p>Much more importantly, one must realize that <strong><em>of course</em> </strong>transfer payments were higher than usual in 2010 &#8211; we were emerging from the deepest recession in 75 years. Transfer payments are crucial automatic stabilizers for the economy, and comprise our society&#8217;s safety net. They have been operating exactly as they&#8217;re supposed to, with payments rising during a recession to make up for the fall in other types of income. When you have the deepest recession since the invention of transfer payments, as we did in 2008-09, then of course you would expect to find them rise to their highest levels ever.</p>
<p>Finally, the alarming statistics cited in such articles are really just due to one, and only one, phenomenon: the incredible and seemingly unstoppable rise in health care costs in the US.</p>
<p>The blue line in the following picture shows transfer payments as a percent of total personal income. The red line shows transfer payments excluding Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IYEBVWmuTaA/TXgtF4ssWoI/AAAAAAAAAaM/3hRk23RuG8w/s1600/transfers%2Bas%2Bpct%2Bof%2Bincome.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IYEBVWmuTaA/TXgtF4ssWoI/AAAAAAAAAaM/3hRk23RuG8w/s400/transfers%2Bas%2Bpct%2Bof%2Bincome.PNG"></a><br />With the exception of health care costs, there&#8217;s really no trend to see in this data at all. Really, it&#8217;s all about health care costs. Again. Still.</p>

                                <p>by Daniel Becker</p>
<p>I posted in 7/2009 on the issue of fixing our healthcare system based on the Massachusetts model. The first was <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/massachusetts-is-fixing-fixed-health.html">Massachusetts is fixing the fixed healthcare system</a>.   The second was a followup to the first:  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/fixing-fixing-health-care-deja-vu.html">Fixing the fixing. Healthcare Deja vu.</a></p>
<p>The issue was that we are dancing around. All the proposals to date have been nothing more than a relabeling of already tried organizational structuring within the private insurance model.  I ended the first article with a quote from a NEJM report and a my question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite these imprecisions, the difference in the costs of health care administration between the United States and Canada is clearly large and growing. <strong>Is $294.3 billion annually for U.S. health care administration money well spent?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Well, is it? Did they even ask?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I ended the second article with: </p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re talking the same old approach to what really is a problem with the product. At least in the bad socialist health care programs they recognize that a for profit third party only adds cost and thus do not have to account for that part of our problem (it&#8217;s called savings). They just need to resolve the product quality issue. It is the only common issue to all nations. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m taking bets on the date of the new fix of the newly fixed, fixed system. </p></blockquote>
<p>Ok folks. The betting is closed. Time to lay the cards on the table. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />US News and World Report: <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/news/2011/march/mass-health-reform-hasnt-halted-medical-bankruptcies">Mass. Health Reform Hasn&#8217;t Halted Medical Bankruptcies</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Health costs in the state have risen sharply since reform was enacted. Even before the changes in health care laws, most medical bankruptcies in Massachusetts &#8212; as in other states &#8212; afflicted middle-class families with health insurance. High premium costs and gaps in coverage &#8212; co-payments, deductibles and uncovered services &#8212; often left insured families liable for substantial out-of-pocket costs. None of that changed. For example, under Massachusetts&#8217; reform, the least expensive individual coverage available to a 56-year-old Bostonian carries a premium of $5,616, a deductible of $2,000, and covers only 80 percent of the next $15,000 in costs for covered services,&#8221; the researchers wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>The results from the actual published article in <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/docs/2011/AJM_Mass-Reform-hasnt-stopped-med-bankruptcies.pdf">The American Journal of Medicine</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>In 2009, illness or medical bills contributed to 52.9% of bankruptcies in Massachusetts. In contrast, in early 2007, medical bankruptcies accounted for 59.3% of personal bankruptcies in the state (P#.44 for comparison with 2009 proportion) and 62.1% nationally (P#.02). Because the total number of personal bankruptcy filings in Massachusetts increased by 51% between fiscal years 2007 and 2009(6) the absolute number of <strong>medical bankruptcies in the state actually increased by more than one third during that period, from 7504 to 10,093</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The profile of the bankruptcies:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Most of the recent Massachusetts debtors were female (Table 1). Their average age was 48.2 years, two thirds of them had attended college, and 70.5% owned a home or had owned one within the past 5 years. The average debtor household included 2.94 persons; in three quarters of them, at least 1 adult was employed at the time of bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p>In 2009, 45.6% of the entire sample (86.2% of the medically bankrupt) had high medical bills or specifically cited illness as a cause of their bankruptcy, proportions that did not vary by insurance</p>
<p>status. The remaining 13.8% of the medically bankrupt (7.3% of the entire sample) were classified as medically bankrupt because they had lost significant work-related income because of illness or had mortgaged a home to pay medical bills.</p>
<p>As would be expected in a state where medical insurance is mandatory, the overwhelming majority (89.0%) of debtors had health insurance for themselves and all of their dependents at the time of bankruptcy filing&#8230;</p>
<p>The 2009 coverage rates in Massachusetts were higher than those for Massachusetts debtors in 2007 (before the coverage mandate was enforced), when 84.1% had insurance at the time of filing and approximately one third (34.1%) had experienced a coverage gap. In both 2007 and 2009, Massachusetts debtors’ had higher coverage rates than in our 2007 national sample, in which only 69.7% of bankrupt families were insured at the time of filing and 37.4% had experienced a gap.</p></blockquote>
