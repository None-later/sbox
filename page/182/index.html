                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Brad DeLong and Matthew Yglesias report that operation Twist worked, because 30 year bond yields have declined since it was announced.</p>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/09/operation-twist.html">Brad</a> &#8220;30y Treasury yield down 13 bps, 2y yield up 5bps. Exactly what you would expect with announcement of twist operation.&#8221;  So Brad why were you so sure that the 30y yield would not decrease by 12 or 14 bps ?  Do you use &#8220;exactly&#8221; exactly according to the exact dictionary definition ?</p>
<p>Matt Yglesias also reports that it works.  He didn&#8217;t type &#8220;exactly&#8221; and showed a bar graph.</p>
<p>The latest from Bloomberg shows change from last close of +0.03% not -0.13 %</p>
<p>I actually don&#8217;t know if this means -0.1 from the announcement or +0.03 from the announcement.  I don&#8217;t really care.  0.1 % one way or not will make almost no difference.  </p>
<p>The answer to the question is no.  Yglesias and DeLong did not give a hostage to fortune, because making a big deal about -0.13% is silly no matter what happens later.</p>
<p>OK Brad did say the FOMC did 10% of what it should have done.  That is giving a hostage to fortune. &#8211; 1.3 % sure isn&#8217;t enough but it is significant.  +0.35 % not so good.  So that is a hostage to fortune hanging from a linear extrapolation.</p>
<p>Possibly irrelvant figure on certainly tiny changes after the jump.</p>
<p>update:  The figure shows the 2 days after compared to the day after.  So the 30 year yield is lower than it was at the time of announcement.  I have trouble with time zones.  As I typed before when I didn&#8217;t know for sure what day it is.  Who cares ?</p>
<p>update II:  Good thing I didn&#8217;t give any hostages to fortune.  The change in the 30 year Treasury bond yield Sep 20 to latest is now <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-23/fed-s-twist-fails-to-convince-investors-growth-will-follow.html">-0.4%</a> which sure isn&#8217;t negligible.</p>

                                <p>As regular—well, obsessive&#8211;readers know, I’m stealing a title from the sainthood-destined <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~tertilt/" target="_blank">Michèle Tertilt</a>.  But it seems appropriate—and a better title than “Engaging Boys and Men as Allies for Long-term Change”—for today’s Plenary hosted by Former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.</p>
<p>We got a taste of this yesterday, on the panel hosted by Robin Roberts (now a host at <em>Good Morning, America</em>, apparently; I stopped paying attention to her career after she left ESPN, around the time I stopped paying attention to ESPN), when Dikembe Mutombo declared that having daughters had changed his worldview, no to mention a CGI member from the floor who reminded anyone who had forgotten that the doors that opened for Roberts herself were largely <a href="http://livestre.am/12WnV" target="_blank">driven by the opportunities created by Title IX</a>, If you treat half of the population as if it only consume and can never produce, you lose opportunities.  When you stop doing it, opportunities open and the pie gets larger.</p>
<p>Gary Thomas Barker, the International Director of <em><a href="http://www.promundo.org.br/" target="_blank">Instituto Promundo</a></em>, notes that two-thirds of the men in the world don’t abuse women, and that we need to move closer to 100%, since abuse reduces chances of economic development (no matter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Morrison" target="_blank">how self-delusional the U.S. Supreme Court may have been</a>), even if there were an excuse for it.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Market share corrected in the following paragraph; with thanks to Maggie Edinger at Hill &#038; Knowlton for the correction and a link to <a href="http://outlookafghanistan.net/news?post_id=312">this Reuters article discussing the company&#8217;s plans in Afghanistan for this year</a>.</p>
<p>Karim Khoja, Chief Executive Officer of mobile phone provider Roshan runs the largest telephone company in Afghanistan—with <s>6%</s> 35% of the market—and notes that 55% of the people in Afghanistan (his potential customers) are women. But Roshan knew when going into the country that the <em>financial</em> decisions for the household are controlled by the men, so direct targeting of women would not work—until very recently.  The initial pitch was “know where your wife is.”  Three years later, there are women buying their own mobiles—with, presumably, the full knowledge and blessing of men who have seen and understood the advantage to themselves of having them doing so. <a name="more"></a>
<p>Khoja also noted that, while women spend about 20% less than men on their mobile services, they are more loyal to the company—and are, therefore, the more profitable customers to have.</p>
<p>Most interesting is Khoja explaining the hoops the company had to go through to <em>hire </em>their first woman: direct family discussion, including driving her to and from the office, ensuring an appropriately courteous work atmosphere (White House employees need not apply), and that it took nearly a year before the company reached critical mass.  At this point, he essentially had noted that he was discussing a chicken-egg cycle where women could not get jobs or start businesses without having access to funding, and couldn’t get access to funding without getting a job or starting a business.</p>
<p>Muhammad Yunus of the Yunus Center then took over, explaining the details of the early days of Grameen: how their making loans to worthy business ideas—which largely came from and were to women—led to having to explain to men the advantages that come from having a two-income family.  This was followed by discussions with the women, who were then alert to (and, of course, able to address) the issues raised by their husbands. The initial result is that everyone became comfortable with the new situation; the collateral effect—which should be to no one’s great surprise—was that many of the women’s businesses improved even more after familial buy-in was achieved.  By the third year, the villages have a strong base of working women’s businesses and the model expands itself.  Generations of progress were made in the space of a few years, and Yunus and Grameen have never had to look back from that model.</p>
<p>President Bachelet notes that she probably would not have been President if she had not first been Minister of Defense—not, conspicuously, Minister of Health.</p>
<p>Muhammad Yunus notes that we have to move to the next step: it’s no longer just about making money, it’s also about problem-solving. “Social business” produces more loyal employees and a better chance at successful innovation. From the floor, a leader of Coca-Cola notes that they have been expanding their small business efforts with female leaders, which has given them better work.  (Also notes that the sponsored a “water-harvesting project” for every goal scored in the 2010 World Cup—which resulted in 520 projects being initiated.)</p>
<p>Another commenter from the floor notes that, fifteen years ago, 75% of the new AIDS cases in Africa were girls under the age of fifteen. It’s difficult to educate, let alone turn into a businesswoman, someone who is dying and/or pregnant.</p>
<p>Republic of Rwanda President Paul Kagame closed by noting that this entire panel has been “common sense.”  The scariest part of it is that these things keep needing to be said.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>by <strong>Mike Kimel</strong></p>
<p>Recently I had the opportunity to speak to Professor David Cohen&#8217;s class on the US Presidency in the Political Science department at the University of Akron.  </p>
<p>My talk was structured around three questions involving some extremely simple recent economic history.  None of the questions were trick questions.  </p>
<p>The questions appear below.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Question 1. From 1980 to 1992, the top marginal tax income tax rate was:<br />-70% in 1980<br />-69.125% in 1981<br />-50% from 1982 &#8211; 1986<br />-38.25% in 1987<br />-28% from 1988 &#8211; 1990<br />-31% in 1991 and 1992 </p>
<p>Given this pattern, which of the two graphs that follows do you expect shows the growth rate in real GDP over that period?</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0IVOmHR3b0w/TnqF-FHwQ5I/AAAAAAAAAtg/pTSbjQUzWb4/s1600/davidcohen1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0IVOmHR3b0w/TnqF-FHwQ5I/AAAAAAAAAtg/pTSbjQUzWb4/s320/davidcohen1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1 Option A</p>
<p>Option A:  A few years after the first tax cuts, there was one year of unusually strong growth.  Subsequent growth slowed a lot, and continued slowing as tax rates fell further.  </p>
<p>or&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mOtGq6nLrNQ/TnqF-WodkuI/AAAAAAAAAto/i4QljAgnFuw/s1600/davidcohen1B.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mOtGq6nLrNQ/TnqF-WodkuI/AAAAAAAAAto/i4QljAgnFuw/s320/davidcohen1B.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1 Option B</p>
<p>Option B:  The more tax rates were cut, the faster the economy grew. And then Bush I broke his “read my lips, no new taxes” promise and the economy slowed again.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Question 2.  <br />The following is the list of eight year administrations since 1929:  <br />-FDR (1933 – 1941)<br />-Truman (1945 – 1953)<br />-Ike (1953 – 1961)<br />-JFK/LBJ (1961 – 1969)<br />-Nixon/Ford (1969 – 1977)<br />-Reagan (1981 &#8211; 1989)<br />-Clinton (1993 – 2001)<br />-Bush 2 (2001 – 2009)<br />(FDR&#8217;s first 8 years are included, but the War years are left out.  Also, Truman took over a few months into the term.)</p>
<p>It turns out that the degree to which each administration cut the tax burden (i.e., current tax receipts/GDP) during its first two years in office seems to strongly affect the growth rate in real GDP in the subsequent six years in office.  (E.g., the amount by which Reagan cut the tax burden from 1980, Carter&#8217;s last year in office, to 1982 seems to strongly affect the annualized growth rate in real GDP from 1982 to 1988.)  </p>
<p>Which of the following two graphs do you think best explains the relationship that was observed between the change in the tax burden in the first two years of the administration and the subsequent growth in real GDP over the remaining six years?</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eM39pnOgwxM/TnqF-vpraHI/AAAAAAAAAtw/1WNE6aZTWpY/s1600/davidcohen2A.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eM39pnOgwxM/TnqF-vpraHI/AAAAAAAAAtw/1WNE6aZTWpY/s320/davidcohen2A.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2 Option A</p>
<p>Option A:  Administrations which reduced tax burdens early on enjoyed rapid growth later.   Administrations which increased tax burdens early had poor growth later.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CmRc8O0GtWQ/TnqF-nZbohI/AAAAAAAAAt4/DC-FWjkcewo/s1600/davidcohen2B.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CmRc8O0GtWQ/TnqF-nZbohI/AAAAAAAAAt4/DC-FWjkcewo/s320/davidcohen2B.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2 Option B</p>
<p>Option B:  Administrations which lowered tax burdens early on suffered through poor growth later.   Administrations which raised tax burdens early had strong growth later.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Question 3<br />Reaganomics involved cutting taxes and reducing regulation.  The New Deal (for our purposes, not including World War 2 years) involved tax hikes and increased government control over the economy.  Which of the following two graphs shows the growth rate in Real GDP over the Reagan and FDR years?</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9IpU47ET_us/TnqGHv6dlwI/AAAAAAAAAuA/_kPqyaxbwZw/s1600/davidcohen3A.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9IpU47ET_us/TnqGHv6dlwI/AAAAAAAAAuA/_kPqyaxbwZw/s320/davidcohen3A.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3 Option A.  </p>
<p>Option A.  Growth was faster under Reagan than under FDR.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Wub7tnxi1nQ/TnqGH0q_6oI/AAAAAAAAAuI/-vGrMgSPBRo/s1600/davidcohen3B.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Wub7tnxi1nQ/TnqGH0q_6oI/AAAAAAAAAuI/-vGrMgSPBRo/s320/davidcohen3B.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3 Option B.  </p>
<p>Option B.  Growth was faster under FDR than under Reagan</p>
<p>(ANSWERS AFTER THE JUMP)<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The answers&#8230;<br />1.  Option A:  A few years after the first tax cuts, there was one year of unusually strong growth.  Subsequent growth slowed a lot, and continued slowing as tax rates fell further.   <br />2.  Option B:  Administrations which lowered tax burdens early on suffered through poor growth later.   Administrations which raised tax burdens early had strong growth later.<br />3.  Option B.  Growth was faster under FDR than under Reagan.  Quite a bit faster, in fact.</p>
<p>By the way&#8230; in each of the questions, the data for both options A and B was &#8220;real.&#8221;  Its just the wrong answer, in each case, the growth rates did not match the taxes for any given year, but rather were sorted in order to fit the story line that everyone seems to believe.  Also, for Question 2, I could have used the first year, the first three years, the first four years, the first six years, or the first seven years rather than the first two years of the administration v. the remaining years of growth and gotten similar graphs.  Using the tax change for the first five years v. the annualized change in growth fro the subsequent three years shows almost no correlation whatsoever.  My guess is that&#8217;s the outlier, given every other combination shows a recognizable story.</p>
<p>Its also worth noting&#8230; the three questions I picked are not &#8220;gotcha&#8221; questions or special cases.  They&#8217;re central to the macroeconomic theory that has prevailed in the United States for the past few decades, and which American economists have managed to sell to the rest of the developed world since about 1990.  The Reagan tax cuts are usually presented as exhibit A that tax cuts &#8220;work.&#8221;  But I could have used Exhibit B (the so-called Kennedy tax cuts) instead.  It wouldn&#8217;t have made a difference.  The second question is an attempt to show how policies affect the economy the entire time they are in effect.  Essentially, all the data available since the BEA began computing GDP is there, except the Hoover years, the Bush 1 years, the Carter years, and WW2.    The third question compares what are often referred to as the worst economic policies this country enacted in the past 100 years to what are often referred as the paragon of economic policies in the same period.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sad to say I&#8217;m confident most economics professors in the United States would get the three questions wrong.  I&#8217;m also sad to say, I think it is no more possible to explain the US economy without knowing these facts than it is to produce a useful theory of the solar system assuming turtles all the way down.  </p>
<p>And since most economics professors wouldn&#8217;t get it right, that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve been teaching.   I would venture to guess, in fact, that a student at, say U of Chicago or George Mason University (to use the flagships for two of the more popular &#8220;schools of thought&#8221;)  is more likely to get these questions wrong after taking an economics course than before.  And now, after a few decades, its now popular wisdom and the foundation of our economy.

                                <p>Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/09/from-ron-suskinds-confidence-men.html" target="_blank">cited this passage from Ron Suskind’s latest book on Monday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Both [Christina Romer and Larry Summers], in fact, were concerned by something the president had said in a morning briefing: that he thought that high unemployment was due to productivity gains in the economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same meme spread across the economics spectrum: Scott Sumner <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=10904" target="_blank">was horrified</a>. Mike Konczal’s reaction (on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rortybomb/status/116145008138129408" target="_blank">Twitter</a>) was restrained (“This is…depressing”) by comparison.</p>
<p>In the context of Suskind’s book, we might just assume that Obama was, as usual, being gulled by his handler Rahm and his Svengali, Timmeh Geithner. However, via <a href="http://modeledbehavior.com/2011/09/20/there-is-no-monetary-and-fiscal-stimulus-because-the-president-doesnt-believe-in-monetary-and-fiscal-stimulus/" target="_blank">Karl Smith</a>, we can set to rest any doubt that Barack Obama is just being misled. Matt Yglesias <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/09/20/323488/does-president-obama-believe-productivity-growth-explains-high-levels-of-unemployment/" target="_blank">catches a lazy piece of  “thinking” from the President</a>—who has had Austan Goolsbee, Larry Summers, Peter Orszag, Alan Kreuger, Jason Furman, Jason Bernstein, and several others (even dissing Christina Romer, as the Now-Sainted-by-the-Press-for-his-Fairness-to-Women Obama <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/09/from-ron-suskinds-confidence-men.html" target="_blank">explicitly did</a>) to correct him:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a June interview with Fox News, President Obama appeared to argue that the country is suffering from high unemployment because productivity enhancing technologies such at ATMs <a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/president-obama/2011/06/14/obama-blames-atms-high-unemployment">have reduced the need for work</a>.  It wasn’t clear to me at the time if the president really meant that or if it was just a bad moment in an interview,  . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Team Obama has, I think, landed on a more sophisticated version of this theory, and that explains some of the reason why Romer &#038; Summers aren’t in the administration anymore and haven’t been replaced by like-minded people. [link in original]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, Barack Obama “might not be particularly well-informed about economics” (Sumner), but I never would have thought he was that obtuse. </p>
<p>Let me talk for a moment about our shared experience. Obama was a year behind me in college. As a transfer student, he didn’t start with on-campus housing; he got a room in a flat in the mid-100s.  So he walked to school—past several banks, one of which was undoubtedly more than happy to open an account for a never-attended-public-school Ivy Leaguer who, even then, knew how to manage up. (Heck, they opened one for me, and I fail miserably at most of that description.)</p>
<p>And the one thing you got—whether it was Chase (back before Manny Hanny acquired it) or Citibank (before it became The Big C)—as a student, no minimum balance required, was an ATM card, usable (in the case of Chase) virtually any time in one of the three (3) enclosed ATMs.  They dispensed $5 and $10 bills.</p>
<p>(The “enclosed” is essential, not just for nighttime safety, but also for days of rain and snowses. Years later, in MBA school, we attended the presentation of a guest speaker, a prominent Georgian who had founded an “Internet bank.” He freely stated that he didn’t understand why some companies enclosed their ATMs; I put the now-bankrupt company on my “short” list immediately.)</p>
<p>That was <strong>thirty (30) years ago</strong>. Putting this as politely as possible, that’s a heckuva long time for “structural change” in employment to take effect.  To put it in context, I know<em> hot type setters</em> who have been out of that business for less time.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>It would take someone who was completely unaware of the world around him to point to the ATM as a ca.-2007 cause of structural unemployment in the United States.</p>
<p>Now, you may, correctly, note that there are Many More ATMs in 2011 than there were when Barack H. Obama moved to Morningside Heights in 1981.  And I will certainly agree with you: after all, if you spend 25 years privileging capital investment over labor—not to mention thirty attacking labor—you <em>should</em> expect capital growth.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that capital growth is welfare-enhancing, or even necessarily has a positive ROI.</p>
<p>At Bear Stearns’s main building, 383 Madison, there were two Chase ATMs on the second floor. Those who know NYC will note that there are not one but <em>two</em> Chase branches across the street, but traders and senior executives require convenience, not crossing a NYC street (which they only did to cash/deposit their bonus checks) or, especially, standing in a queue behind people whose time is much less valuable. </p>
<p>(Tone notwithstanding, the last part of that is rather serious: if being away means you or your firm might take a loss in the mid-five or low-six figure range, your work time <em>is</em> more valuable than that of a Claire’s Stores saleswoman. Much better when the worst-case scenario is to be stuck behind one or two of your fellow traders, who wouldn’t waste their time not knowing exactly what they intend to do <em>before</em> getting to the machine.)</p>
<p>And, since the traders and executives weren’t willing to be personally ripped off, the ATMs were no-fee, even for non-Chase cards.</p>
<p>And here is where an alert economist will say <em>cui bono?</em> The answer is: the firm paid $1.2MM ($1,200,000; $600,000 per machine) for those two machines to be there, be maintained, and be fee-free.</p>
<p>So when you point to those ATMs in the grocery store, I point to the 99 cent ($0.99) fee for a $40 withdrawal and say glibly, “Yes, usury is alive and well; you don’t even need to be in a counting house.”  </p>
<p>How many jobs does that ATM destroy?</p>
<p>And—again, if you’re able to think about it, the way some economists (mostly health economists and econometricians, it seems) are able to do—you look at the proliferation of ATMs and realize that each of them needed to be stocked with bills (now $20s and $50s), have their network connections maintained, be repaired, have (a portion of) a staff member available to deal with customer complaints and issues, and be installed based on an initial capital outlay/agreement that covers all of those costs.</p>
<p>If we treat the Bear Stearns arrangement—and Bear and Chase were tight even before the latter “paid the two dollars”—as a benchmark, a semi-full service (as with the ATMs in most grocery stores and Duane Reades, they didn’t take deposits) ATM costs a lot more to run than a bank teller does. As a ballpark, it may be an order of magnitude more, and that’s rounding the ATM costs down (ca. $500K) and the teller expenses up ($50K).</p>
<p>All of the above is even ignoring The Baumol Problem.  You can provide most of your services through an ATM, or a group of ATMs, if it/they work(s) perfectly, but you cannot eliminate the “teller” role completely. You can redefine it: a bonded employee to restock the bills being dispensed is needed, so you can take a teller away from a “window” for an hour a day: seven hours as a teller, one in service of the ATM. And you can move <em>new </em>bank branches into slightly smaller spaces (based on not needing so many tellers), but you’re more likely to convert some of that space in old branches to space for HNW banking efforts, concentrating on areas that require greater customer service.</p>
<p>So the specific, limited job of “bank teller” might have been reduced (assuming bank branches remained constant; anecdotally, I would suggest they expanded significantly)—unlike hot type, it didn’t go away. But the skillset required for tellers is mostly transferrable: excepting any specific licensing/bonding requirements, if you can be a teller, you can be a cashier or a customer service representative or a sales assistant or a realtor.  It’s not like hot type in that respect—the initial skillset is transferrable.</p>
<p>Add the jobs that become available—network engineers, security people, drivers, system administrators, and people to build all of that equipment—when an ATM is installed and reduce that by a fraction of the tellers who won’t get hired.  Throw in an adjustment for the deadweight loss that is added to the economy via the ATM fees (which is at least partially balanced by the expansion of the ATMs themselves), and overall you have to conclude that the ATM <em>increased</em> the number of jobs available.</p>
<p>Economists often call it “creative destruction,” and you would think that the Goolsbees and Summerses of the world would have explained it to Obama.  In fact, you would think it would be something about which a community organizer would have heard, since much of the effort required there is making it possible for your clients to find retraining opportunities.</p>
<p>That he would speak so absurdly so recently reflects poorly on the economists who advised him (not to mention those who still believe his explanation),</p>

                                <p>Elaine Kamarck wrote an article in The Washington Monthly&#8217;s blog &#8220;Ten Miles Square&#8221; entitled <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/ten-miles-square/2011/09/no_time_to_go_wobbly_on_welfar032288.php#">&#8220;NO Time to Go Wobbly on Welfare Reform&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Briefly for those who have not clicked the link, the article stresses that TANF (aka welfare) is a very small component of the social welfare safety net (as was AFDC before welfare reform). Kamarck argues that one would not have such a negative view of welfare reform if one considered the whole poverty assistance system. She presents data on the poverty rate and discusses its change over time. Then mixing political strategy and policy analysis, she argues that it would be very politically costly for Democrats to question welfare reform.</p>
<p>I agree entirely with the first claim, which is not related to the rest of the article (which discusses policy not politics and reality not the median voters&#8217; perception of reality).</p>
<p>The article contains factual errors. They are not minor.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>1) Kamarck shows a graph of total EITC and AFDC/TANF benefits and writes &#8220;As the following chart illustrates, spending on the EITC took off just as welfare reform was adopted.&#8221; This claim is false. As the graph shows, spending on the EITC took off in 1993 following the passage of the Clinton recovery bill (tax increase for rich people, .7 cent a gallon gas tax and massive expansion of the EITC). This was three years before the welfare reform bill signed in 1996. Kamarck asserts 1993=1996. In fact 1993<br />2) Kamarck writes &#8220;the welfare rolls, which, by supporting mothers only if they weren’t working and weren’t married.&#8221; In fact in 1996 (and earlier) some married women and some employed women received AFDC benefits. In 1996 AFDC was available to married couples with children (subject to availability for work rules) in 25 states. It is just not true that only unmarried women received AFDC (it is true that few married couples with children were poor enough to qualify but that is a fact about income distribution and not about the program in those 25 states). Also AFDC was available to women who worked but had very low incomes (benefits would be zero for someone who worked year round full time for the minimum wage). IIRC the effective marginal tax rate was around 70%. However, for Kamarck&#8217;s claim to be true, it would have to be infinite at labour income =0. </p>
<p>Now both of Karmack&#8217;s claims about AFDC are uncontroversial &#8212; they are something which everyone thinks he or she knows. They are also false. I think they should be corrected.</p>
<p>In addition to the two very important (central to the article) errors of fact mentioned above, Kamarck makes very serious errors of omission. She notes that Clinton vetoed an earlier welfare reform bill which converted food stamps to a block grant. She neglects to mention that the bill he signed massively cut food stamps. The projected savings from the bill were overwhelmingly due to the food stamps cuts not the transition from AFDC to TANF. </p>
<p>I suspect (just a guess not a claim) that the actual ex post cuts in the 90s were more than 100% due to the cuts in food stamps &#8212; the AFDC was an entitlement without a fixed budget so spending would have fallen during the late 90s boom. The federal TANF contribution is a block grant which does not depend on how many people are needy so it didn&#8217;t fall in the 90s. I guess that in the first years after welfare reform TANF cost the Federal Government more than AFDC would have cost.</p>
<p>But the cuts to the food stamps program were severe dwarfing the cuts to AFDC/TANF spending. </p>
<p>It is not at all possible to evaluate the effect of welfare reform on the poor by looking at the poverty rate. For one thing food stamps are not counted as income in the calculation of the poverty rate. The program and the massive cuts in 1996 just don&#8217;t appear in the headline data on poverty.</p>
<p>Much more importantly, neither TANF nor AFDC is designed to reduce the poverty rate. AFDC and TANF benefits are not high enough to bring income over the poverty line. The purpose of the programs is to prevent severe poverty while keeping the long long term unemployed poor so that they have an incentive to seek work. </p>
<p>The poverty rate is just one statistic which gives us some information about poverty. It would be the whole story only if a household with income one cent before the poverty line suffered as much as a household with 0 income. To find possible costs due to welfare reform, one has to consider the distribution of income among households below the poverty line. One easily available statistic is the severe poverty rate (also called the deep poverty rate) the fraction of people in households with income below half the poverty line. </p>
<p>Data on severe poverty rate only go back to 1975. The current level is the highest on record. The ratio of the severe poverty rate to the poverty rate has increased since welfare was reformed. The sever poverty rate and this ratio are useful if one wishes to determine whether welfare reform may have hurt the poor by making them severely poor and not just poor. Kamarck considers only the poverty rate. This is a serious conceptual error.</p>
<p>I believe that her article contains false claims of fact which should be corrected and that it makes a contribution to the discussion of no value whatsoever.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a big week for the American economy. President Obama announced his plans to reduce the deficit on Monday, and Wednesday afternoon the Federal Reserve announces its new plan to boost growth. Do these proposals make sense? And what do they really mean for your money?</p>
<p>MoneyWatch editors Jill Schlesinger and Jack Otter will discuss in this week&#8217;s live &#8220;Ask the Experts&#8221; webcast. They will be joined by economist and MoneyWatch blogger Mark Thoma. <br />• Where should you be investing now?<br />• Will any jobs be created this year?<br />• Where can you find a job now?<br />• Has the housing market finally hit bottom?<br />• What will it really take to restart the American economy?</p>

Of course the point also being&#8230;what is going to be the source of growth for US citizens?</p>
<blockquote><p> <a target="_blankl" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/housing-vs-household-formation.html#comments"><strong>kharris</strong> comments</a> and adds another contributing factor on the housing market:</p>
<p>&#8230;Banks already have pretty nearly all the housing assets they care to have, thank you very much. If banks don&#8217;t want more housing assets, then they won&#8217;t lend much money against houses. That reluctance to lend is going to keep effective housing demand down, even if demographics are favorable.   </p>
<p>And herein lies the problem. Housing demographics are responding to labor market conditions, and financial conditions.  Each needs to improve, and the failure of either to improve limits improvement in the other.  We traditionally rely on housing to lead recoveries, and there are self-reinforcing limitations on housing right now.  Rather than overall growth responding to housing, this time housing needs overall growth.  That means we need some other source of growth to lead.  </p>
<p>In response to that situation, one party says &#8220;cut taxes and regulation and (mumble, mumble, mumble), and then the economy will be great and all our problems will be gone.&#8221;  The other party says &#8220;the best we can do is go small and pretend it&#8217;s enough.&#8221;  There is no alternative source of growth in either of those.</p></blockquote>
