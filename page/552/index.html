<p><a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/09/bailout-agreement-reached.html">Calculated Risk</a> and many others note that a tentative agreement might be done, details to follow to day perhaps, &#8216;before the opening of the Asian markets&#8217;.  Barney Frank, a hometown citizen wants a clearer explanation than it is a compromise on a  compromise agreement needing to be passed by tomorrow.  Please convince me with more information or risk losing my vote of confidence in you all these years.  Why will the economy collapse tomorrow rather than Tuesday?  E-mail Mr. Frank to ask:  <a href="http://www.house.gov/frank/">Barney Frank</a> House office.</p>
<p>Update:  reader ken says:<br />
<blockquote>This has to occur before the end of the quarter otherwise it will do the bank&#8217;s balance sheets no good. </p>
<p>This is obvious. If banks have to report these assets at the marked down prices instead of the more reasonable hold-to-maturity value more banks will fail. By next Friday we will have a dozen bank failures if this is not passed before the markets open.<br />ken |     | Email | 09.28.08 &#8211; 11:48 am | #</p></blockquote>
<p>Rdan here&#8230;.If this is the only reason, book keeping, is there another way to handle books for one extra quarter, given the seriousness of the situation?  Bookkeeping?  Or am I misinterpreting the comment?</p>

<blockquote><p>Wall Street&#8217;s five biggest firms paid more than $3 billion in the last five years to their top executives, while they presided over the packaging and sale of loans that helped bring down the investment-banking system.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch &#038; Co. paid its chief executives the most, with Stanley O&#8217;Neal taking in $172 million from 2003 to 2007 and John Thain getting $86 million, including a signing bonus, after beginning work in December. The company agreed to be acquired by Bank of America Corp. for about $50 billion on Sept. 15. Bear Stearns Cos.&#8217;s James &#8220;Jimmy&#8221; Cayne made $161 million before the company collapsed and was sold to JPMorgan Chase &#038; Co. in June.</p>
<p>Democrats and Republicans in Congress are demanding that limits be placed on executive pay as part of the $700 billion financial rescue plan proposed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. The former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO, who received about $111 million between 2003 and 2006, said in testimony to Congress on Sept. 24 that he would accept such limits as part of the plan, after initially opposing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update:  reader Jack links to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/business/28melt.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">NYT story </a>that is required reading, and it looks like the series will be quite revealing&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>.I.G.F.P. It was run with almost complete autonomy, and with an iron hand, by Joseph J. Cassano, according to current and former A.I.G. employees.</p>
<p>A onetime executive with Drexel Burnham Lambert — the investment bank made famous in the 1980s by the junk bond king Michael R. Milken, who later pleaded guilty to six felony charges — Mr. Cassano helped start the London unit in 1987.</p>
<p>The unit became profitable enough that analysts considered Mr. Cassano a dark horse candidate to succeed Maurice R. Greenberg, the longtime chief executive who shaped A.I.G. in his own image until he was ousted amid an accounting scandal three years ago.</p>
<p>But last February, Mr. Cassano resigned after the London unit began bleeding money and auditors raised questions about how the unit valued its holdings. By Sept. 15, the unit’s troubles forced a major downgrade in A.I.G.’s debt rating, requiring the company to post roughly $15 billion in additional collateral — which then prompted the federal rescue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rdan here:  Less the housing crisis, more former rascals of the Savings and Loan major collapse and bailout&#8230;.heading up what units?  Probably worth a post or two as we follow the story.</p>
<p>Update 3:  Yves Smith at<a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/09/aig-bailout-saved-goldman.html"> Naked Capitalism</a> has a thought on the NYT series:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you believe that, I imagine you believe in the tooth fairy too. Goldman had $45 billion of equity as of its last balance sheet date. A loss, if it approached $20 billion, in this general environment of worries about financial firms, would have sent Goldman shares into a tailspin, and the rating agencies have started taking a dim view of overlevered financial firms that appear unable to raise equity on reasonable terms. This certainly would have lead to a downgrade, and that has put other firms on a slippery downward slope.</p>
<p>Note the article contains a recitation of denials later in the piece that the damage would have been as large as $20 billion or that Goldman&#8217;s exclusive role in the talks was self-interested. </p>
<p>The rest of the story focuses on how the credit default swaps operation, a small unit at AIG, was allowed to take on risks that brought a sizable and otherwise highly successful firm to its knees. It is a riveting read.</p></blockquote>

It also funds most of the rest of the government at current levels until March 6. More than $6 billion will be spent on about 2,000 pet projects known as earmarks, according to the Washington-based Taxpayers for Common Sense.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the man on the street, the proposed bailout seems like nothing more than handouts to the rich. To him, the fortunes of Wall Street are distinguishable and separate from his fortunes. &#8220;Let the suckers sink.&#8221;</p>
<p>While I deeply sympathize with this view, we all must see how what is happening on Wall Street affects everything, from house mortgages, to car and student loans, to credit cards, and more.</p>
<p>Quite simply, credit is drying up.</p>
<p>If credit disappears, then everyone&#8211;rich or poor&#8211;is affected. The farmer needs a sizable loan to carry him through the rough times. The poor student needs a loan so that he can position himself better in marketplace. The small town may to float a bond to cover a much-needed fire engine. Already, student loans are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. Car loans and mortgages are becoming more and more problematical.</p>
<p>To tell Wall Street to take a hike makes for a good sound bite, but it may not be really wise. What happens on Wall Street governs the level of credit, the grease that makes loans and bonds possible.</p>
<p>The problem is: How to fashion a comprehensive plan that addresses everyone&#8217;s needs. Our country is mired in debt. Only the very well off can stand alone, fretting foolishly over a million lost here or there. The rest of us, even if all our bills are paid, stand to suffer as the economy crashes around us. Jobs will be lost; incomes will dwindle.</p>
<p>To understand the depth of our dilemma, I would like to go through<a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/roubini-monitor/253739/home_home_owners_mortgage_enterprise_a_10_step_plan_to_resolve_the_financial_crisis"> Nouriel Roubini&#8217;s rescue plan</a>. In his solution, he does hit <i>most (not all by a long shot)</i> of the buttons. I do this summary as much for myself as for others.</p>
<p>Take note: We are faced not with a mere recession, but a real depression. It is no accident that parts of the Roubini plan harken back to the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Roubinis plan, which is far more intelligent that what so far has appeared in the public media, only begins to touch on our real difficulties. After outlining his plan, I will touch on some of these difficulties.</p>
<p><i>The outrage on the street is, in the final analysis, soundly based.</i></p>
<p>Roubini&#8217;s plan centers around three different kinds of proposed agencies: A Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), a Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC), and a Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC).</p>
<p>Each of these agencies would be modeled on similar ones in the past. (The HOLC and RFC functioned during the Great Depression; the RTC, during the savings and loan crisis in the 1989.) Each addresses a different segment of the problem. Each will require real thought and planning.</p>
<p>There is no easy fix here. Unfortunately, our leaders have diddle away precious time, acting with little foresight. That Wall Street was making a bundle seemed to impress everyone. Little heed was paid to the dangerous currents into which we are now helplessly drifting.</p>
<p>The RTC and Wall Street</p>
<p>Right now, the central problem being addressed is Wall Street. If it goes. credit goes. And if credit goes, the economy freezes. Like small fish, you and I are caught in the ice. Following is Nouriel&#8217;s proposal for the new RTC:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>in exchange for the purchase of illiquid asset (at whatever price it is agreed) the government gets preferred shares in the financial institutions that [are]senior to existing common and preferred shares and that are convertible into common shares to allow government to participate into any future upside</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, you and I, as citizens, now have a stake in those firms. Because we are now &#8220;entrepreneurs&#8221; and now are taking the risks, why should we not get a piece of the action?</p>
<p>
<blockquote>the banks will need more capital if they are undercapitalized and they have not fully reserved/provisioned for the losses coming from writing down the asset being sold to the government. So you will need to inject further actual public capital in the form of preferred shares in the financial institutions</p></blockquote>
<p>And for those already investing in these firms, they, the existing shareholders have to take a nice haircut:</p>
<blockquote><p>the existing shareholders of the banks need to take a first-tier loss to minimize the risks for the government share. How to do that? First, you need to suspend dividend payments on common share and possibly even existing preferred shared; you also need to force to partially match the public capital injection with new Tier 1 capital</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, any losses hit them first before it hits you and me. And all those handsome dividends they paid are suspended. Nice.</p>
<p>Even after we generously remove their bad debts, they may still need working capital to make loans to you and me.</p>
<blockquote><p>you will need to inject further actual public capital in the form of preferred shares in the financial institutions</p></blockquote>
<p>And what is the complaint of all this from those who profit from and love free markets?</p>
<p>Government interference!</p>
<p>To which I say, the government, like any good investor, is protecting its interests. And its primary interest is to see that this economy functions; it&#8217;s secondary interest&#8211;and just as important&#8211;is to see that it profits from it. You who love unregulated, freewheeling markets are threatening the well-being of all us. Sorry, guys. Take a hike and a haircut. Go suck a thumb in your gated McMansions.</p>
<p>To put it another way, the majority want this economy to function. The majority wants the government to make money so that it can have better schools and better health care. You are outvoted.</p>
<p>Additionally,</p>
<blockquote><p>public and private recapitalization of financial institutions unfairly benefits unsecured creditors (all creditors but insured depositors) of such institutions. So, you also need to convert some of this unsecured debt (the sub debt and other debt unsecured debt) into equity (a debt for equity swap). Such swap further reduce the leverage of the financial system (leading to a lower debt to equity ratio for financial institutions)</p></blockquote>
<p>The RFC and banks<br />Curiously, here is where Nouriel is weakest. During the Great Depression, the RFC made loans to more than just banks. Aid was dispensed to state and local communities, to businesses, and railroads. For Nouriel</p>
<blockquote><p>the banks will need more capital if they are undercapitalized and they have not fully reserved/provisioned for the losses coming from writing down the asset being sold to the government. So you will need to inject further actual public capital in the form of preferred shares in the financial institutions ( this is what the RFC did during the Great Depression).</p></blockquote>
<p>The HOLC and the Homeowner</p>
<p>Nouriel&#8217;s details here are sketchy, but clearly we have to address the massive private debt under which many households struggle.<br />
<blockquote>During the Great Depression the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation was create to buy mortgages from bank at a discount price, reduce further the face value of such mortgages and refinance distressed homeowners into new mortgages with lower face value and lower fixed rate mortgage rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>Allowing distressed homeowners to remain in their homes does help. Granted, their homes will now be worth less, but their mortgage load will be reduced accordingly. With reduced value will come reduced taxation. Communities that depended on property taxes will be hit. There is no escape. Schools that depend on property taxes will be hard hit. Health care costs that now are spiraling out of control will be even more deadly. The burgeoning industry in health care will take a serious hit, soon to be affordable only by the very wealthy.</p>
<p>For those who do not own homes and for those who are going from paycheck to paycheck, robbing Peter to pay Paul, what do we do? This issue needs to be addressed. &#8220;How&#8221; is the question. As the economy shrinks&#8211;and it will&#8211;the poorest will be hit the hardest.</p>
<p>Regulatory Reform</p>
<p>In another <a href="http://www.weforum.org/pdf/FinancialDevelopmentReport/2008.pdf">piece</a>, Nouriel addresses the issue of regulatory reform. For the purposes of this piece, suffice it to say that the U.S. missed that boat a long time ago.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s Ahead</p>
<p>What concerns me is the engine that will drive America away from the pit of depression and back into the light. We are in for hard times. Right now, as we can see from how Nouriel&#8217;s plan is weighted&#8211;he gives more detail to Wall Street than Main Street. He does not address what I consider to be the central issue of our economy: How it should create wealth.</p>
<p>That issue is central to any recovery. Otherwise, we are in not only for extended stagflation but also for a spiraling down of our standard of living with little hope for the future.</p>
<p>Our credit crisis has gone hand in hand with our growing trade deficit. For some not to see the connection, I find disturbing. The strength of a country lies in what it has to sell to others. Sound trade policy is essential to our recovery.</p>
<p>Do we need to direct our resources more pointedly? Do we need government to strengthen those industries that will be the engines of the future? Nouriel does not say.</p>
<p>How do we staunch the job bloodletting as more and more of our companies find cheaper jobs and services overseas? Nouriel does not say. In fact, I rarely hear these issues mentioned among professional economists. We are wedded ideologically to a free and open global market place, a marketplace that has been badly structured in terms of the everyday American worker.</p>
<p>We have allowed and encouraged a massive influx of cheap illegal South American labor, which benefits the well-to-do but not our workers. No one speaks for workers here.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?id=1682">study</a>, the U.S. is now behind China in terms of technological competitiveness and that China will soon surpass the U.S.<br />
<blockquote>in the critical ability to develop basic science and technology, turn those developments into products and services – and then market them to the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Who gave the world the Internet? Who seeded the world with computer technology? We did. And where did the producers of that technology go for production? One guess. My brother who has patents in VOIP told me in no uncertain terms: &#8220;We get the ideas going; then the company sends them abroad for further research and development.&#8221; Cheaper. Look again and you will see the research going abroad.</p>
<p>Unless our noses are plunged into its stench, we look the other way as foreign sweatshops make billions for American and other Western companies&#8211;and the stock market cheers. All we can then express is moral outrage. Take a walk on the poor side of some of our communities if you want outrage. Now consider the consequences of a society bred to spend but not to produce.</p>
<p>We now have a society bred to be almost purely financial, a society of moneylenders that use money just to make more money&#8211;arbitrage here, leverage there. Everywhere the moneylenders have their hands out, always figuring new ways gouge their customers, always figuring a new gimmick.</p>
<p>We have forgotten what real credit means. We have forgotten its real purpose. We have forgotten how to produce real wealth, how to compete as a country not as an individual firm.</p>
<p>If our firms go abroad for cheaper labor or cheaper taxation or to take advantage of currency dislocations, we should assess them a price for doing so.</p>
<p>If you really listen to the outrage about the bailout on the street, it is there in the lost jobs, in the day-to-day struggle to survive, in the impossible health care costs, in the equally impossible cost of education.</p>
<p>We have a lot of serious thinking to do.</p>

<p>How much faster will the rate rise?  Technically relatively budget neutral bailout loans in the short run is true, but the government can set value by simply paying for &#8220;assets&#8221;.  What then?  And does it involve printing more money?  And what is a predictable result to inflation if big &#8220;losses&#8221; to US taxpayers are the result?</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/09/26/grocery-store-tries-transparency-customers-balk/">WSJ</a> reports:<br />
<blockquote>Who needs markups? Customers who shop at Eli’s Manhattan, a posh grocery store in Manhattan’s tony Upper East Side, aren’t paying more for individual items — they’re just paying 1.8% more on their bill at the checkout.</p>
<p>Grocery stores find ways to pass higher energy prices onto customers. <br />Eli Zabar, who owns the decade-old two-story haunt known for its $12 chocolate bars, $30 imported nuts and $95 hams, told a CBS affiliate station in New York that he wanted to be transparent to his customers about the need to raise prices as his energy bills soar. So he’s affixed tasteful placards in his store that read “ATTN CUSTOMERS: An energy surcharge of 1.8% will be added to every purchase.”</p>
<p>“I am making the increase completely transparent to the customer,” Mr. Zabar told CBS, “to call the public’s attention to how much fuel is being used in the food business.”</p>
<p>It seems his customers would rather not know, as angry patrons told the news channel they wouldn’t be returning to the store, calling the surcharge “outrageous” on top of prices that are already high.</p>
<p>So Mr. Zabar may now opt for what many other food purveyors have chosen to do: mark up the prices of individual items and hope it doesn’t drive customers away. “If the shock and awe is too great then what we’re gonna do is hide it in the cost of goods itself,” Mr. Zabar said. –Kelly Evans</p></blockquote>

<p>A commenter over at naked capitalism <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/09/europe-opens-ugly.html">notes that</a> </p>
<blockquote><p> $110b of senior LEH debt went from trading .95 to .12 in a matter of days &#8230;. If you include the less senior debt that is trading at essentially zero, LEH had $110b hole in its balance sheet. And just days before this, the market was being told and was believing that the $10b disposition of Neuberger was going to solve their funding problems.</p>
<p>Now is there a precedent in this history of bankruptcy&#8211;excluding cases of accounting fraud&#8211;where bonds collapsed like this once a bankruptcy court opened up the books? I&#8217;m thinking the answer is &#8216;no.&#8217; Which then makes you re-evaluate the premise that there wasn&#8217;t fraud at LEH in marking the value of their assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I may be crazy, but I think that the idea that accounting fraud is required to achieve this is old fashioned and out of date.  I think it can be achieved without breaking the laws, such as they are. </p>
<p>Lehman could have made their senior debt worth 12 cents on a dollar in case of default by selling CD insurance on their own debt &#8212; lots of it.  This would not require any false accounting as they are not required to report this fact.  </p>
<p>Now I would be reluctant to believe that a bank could insure its own debt if it hadn&#8217;t already happened .</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/roubinis-not-wrong-but.html"><br />
<blockquote>The trader then went on to tell me that Commercial Bank of Korea would sell credit default protection on bonds issued by the Commercial Bank of Korea.</p></blockquote>
<p></a></p>
<p>Who would buy a CDS on Lehman from Lehman ?  Only a fool ?  Well I have another candidate &#8212; someone who had bought lots of cash settlement CDSs on Lehman debt from a third party.  The payout on a CDS depends on par value minus settlement value.  A huge amount of Lehman insurance of Lehman is not very useful to someone who wants to hedge, but it is very useful for someone who wants Lehmen to settle for as few cents on the dollar as possible because, he or she has bought Lehman CDSs from a third party.</p>
<p>Now to Lehman, insuring their own debt is a very very attractive proposition.  It is money for nothing unless they go bankrupt and if they are bankrupt well they are bankrupt.  The whole source of moral hazard and adverse selection in credit markets is that it doesn&#8217;t matter to the debtor how much he goes below zero.</p>
<p>A positive price for Lehman insurance of Lehman makes sense (algebra will be after the jump when I type it up).  There was money to be made at the expense of holders of Lehman debt who didn&#8217;t think of the possibility of over-insurance.  </p>
<p>Is this what happened ? I have no idea, but I guess we will find out fairly soon.</p>
<p>update:  My claim about reporting requirements has been contested.  I should stress *again* that I am not an expert and add that I know jack about accounting standards.<br />I have learned a lot from comments here and <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2008/09/28/betting-on-yourself/">at crooked timber</a>.  I reply at tiresome length in comments at crooked timber and at my home blog.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell firms must report the total fair market value of CDS written as liabilities, but this is not what matters to bond holders. To them liabilities matter only to the extent that they cause bankruptcy and/or affect the value of liabilities or assets in case of bankruptcy.  Knowing the expected value of a liability which is worth zero the 99.9 % of the time in which bond holders just get interest and principal and a whole lot the 0.1% of the time in which Lehman brothers is liquidated is of little use to bondholders.  Also, as John Quiggin notes, accounts are not published continuously and our latest information on Lehman Brothers appears to date from May 31 2008 which was a while ago.</p>
<p>First a CDS on LEH issued by LEH is definitely not worthless.  It can&#8217;t possible pay out as described in the terms of the contract, because it only pays when Lehman defaults, but it can pay its stated value times the cents on a dollar payout ratio found by a bankruptcy court.  Even in the case of LEH,this will be positive.</p>
<p>Now algebra.  I will assume all debt is equally senior.  The par value of LEH debt is 1 (for simplicity).  They go under with assets equal to y (which must be less than 1 for them to be bankrupt).    the payout ratio phi is equal to assets over total liabilities.  However the liabilities are not just debt.  They include self CD insurance for x units of par which, in theory shold pay x(1-phi). Actual payment on the CDSs is . </p>
<p>phi is given by <br />1) phi = y/(1+x(1-phi))</p>
<p>Note that phi is not zero, so the CDS has positive value &#8212; you don&#8217;t have to be crazy to buy it.</p>
<p>This gives a quadratic equation with one solution to phi between 0 and 1 </p>
<p>2) phi = (1+x &#8211; ((1+x)^2-4yx)^0.5)/(2x) </p>
<p>phi is definitely real and positive.  2 can be rearranged to </p>
<p>3) phi = (1+x &#8211; ((1-x)^2+4(1-y)x)^0.5)/(2x) </p>
<p>And y <br />taking a first order approximation alpha is approximately equal to </p>
<p>4) phi is roughly equal to y/(1+x) </p>
<p>Which is positive.</p>
<p>So total payouts on CDSs are</p>
<p>5) x(1-phi)phi= xy(1+x-y)/(1+x)^2</p>
<p>And the ratio of the payout to the face value is </p>
<p>6) payout/x = y(1+x-y)/(1+x)^2</p>
<p>oh this is odd. take the derivative of the payout/x with respect to x</p>
<p>7 d(payout/x)/dx = y[(1+x)^2-2(1+x)(1+x-y)]/(1+x)^4 = y(2y-1-x)/(1+x)^3</p>
<p>So the payout per unit of self CDS increases in units of self CDS outstanding until the number of units, x is equal to 2y-1.  For LEH senior debt, imagine the accounts were accurate (as far as they were supposed to go) and y = 0.95, the value of LEH self insurance would increase in LEH self insurance outstanding until the amount was equal to 90% of total LEH senior debt.  That seems to me to be an unstable market.</p>
<p>Now how high would it have to go before it stops making sense to buy CDS from LEH ? </p>
<p>Well that depends on the price doesn&#8217;t it.  If normal investors like Janet Tavakoli won&#8217;t touch it, the price could be very low, say one tenth as much as third party insurance. That would make it optimal to a price taker so long as alpha is greater than 0.1.  Obviously I chose 0.1 out of my hat, because it is close to current market estimated phi of 0.12.</p>
<p>Could this have happened ?  I don&#8217;t see why not.  As far as I know it was all legal and profitable to both parties in the contract.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Know first that I am not in McCain&#8217;s camp&#8211;by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>Obama made a stategic mistake: He constantly was willing to give McCain benefit while McCain was constantly on the attack, giving no quarter at all. He never took the argument directly to McCain, instead we heard repeatedly that &#8220;John is right when he says&#8230;.&#8221; or &#8220;I agree with John when&#8230;.&#8221; Those phrases should never have been uttered, not in a public debate when impressions, not logic, rule.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the debate, McCain was clearly the more uncertain and nervous of the two. But he kept to his script, weaving his patriotism, his fight against pork, his visits abroad into almost every response. Never did he give Obama any credit for anything.</p>
<p>When McCain sidestepped Obama&#8217;s criticism (on taxes, for example), Obama should have restated the point, emphasizing that McCain failed to address the issue he (Obama) had just raised.</p>
<p>Obama should have consistently tied McCain to his support for the wealthy, i.e., Wall Street&#8211;and to Bush economics. Examples: McCain&#8217;s confession of ignorance on economic policy, his support of tax cuts for the wealthy, his admission that he had not even read the initial bailout proposal.</p>
<p>He should never have congratulated McCain on anything&#8230;.</p>
<p>Obama has some lessons to learn, I think.</p>
