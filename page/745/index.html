                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=14405&#038;R=11626F232"> article by Noemi Emory</a> of the Weekly Standard:</p>
<blockquote><p>Eagerly anticipating the defeat in Iraq to which they are so much attached, some on the left have also been preparing for another contingency: the assault that they think they see coming, a drive to pin the whole wretched failure on them.</p></blockquote>
<p> &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>If they had had their way, Iraq would still be the quagmire they are so fond of invoking, and the United States&#8211;or George W. Bush, which may be the more relevant factor&#8211;would have incurred a definitive and, at least in his case, legacy-blasting defeat. It is unfair of course to call this a stab in the back, as the Democrats have been engagingly open about their intentions. In the course of the past year, they have gone from attacking a plan that had not been effective to attacking one that hadn&#8217;t been tried yet, to attacking one that exceeded all expectations, while in the process ignoring reality, slandering a commanding general, and denying American forces in battle due credit for what they had done.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>When our tale opens, it is the last month of 2006&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait a second.  Is that when the tale opens?  And didn&#8217;t Noemi Emory write this article already?  Ah yes,  <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/002/672sdqvi.asp">here</a> it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>GIDDY WITH FAILURE, Democrats are breaking new ground in political strategy. Deep in a hole, they are digging still deeper. They have found a new method of dealing with setbacks: They find out what caused them, and do it again.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Then came the war and the worst of all happened: Democrats were drowned in a flood of good news. There were no wider wars, no more terrorist attacks, no strikes at Israel, no burning oil fields, no destructive Arab-street uprisings, no street-to-street fighting, and mercifully, very few deaths. After arguing that Iraq was a diversion from the war on terror, major al Qaeda figures were captured. After dismissing ties between Saddam and al Qaeda, links are now being uncovered. Even the Democrats&#8217; best worst hope&#8211;the looted museum&#8211;turned out to be useless. It was an inside job, it was unpreventable, and most of the missing artifacts have been found.</p></blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, its been a while.  The good news has given way to terrorist attacks,  street-to-street fighting, and a lot of deaths. Mostly of Iraqis so maybe that doesn&#8217;t matter all that much.</p>
<p>Major al Qaeda figures were captured&#8230; clearly, Emory hasn&#8217;t figured out the difference between al Qaeda and al Qaeda Iraq.  Its like many Middle Easterners who haven&#8217;t figured out the difference between an Israeli and a Jew, or between an American and a Canadian. </p>
<p>But enough of Emory for a moment.  I&#8217;m going to be honest here.  I hope there&#8217;s peace and quiet in Iraq.  I hope it comes today.  It would be nice to open up a newspaper a month from today and read that for 30 days, there have been no shootings or bombings against civilians or US or Iraqi forces in Iraq.  I hate hearing about people dying or fleeing their homes, and only coming back because the Syrians threw them out or they ran out of money even after prostituting their daughters in Jordan.  I hate US tax dollars wasted.   I want Iraq to be like Germany a month after VE day, or Japan a month after VJ day:  quiet and rebuilding.  I really don&#8217;t care if that makes Bush look good.  (I honestly doubt that would be enough at this point, but if it does, so what &#8211; how does eating crow compare to the degree of death and suffering we see regularly in Iraq?)   And I&#8217;d happily put up with the giddy strutting by the likes of Noemi Emory if we got that.</p>
<p>But what are the Noemi Emorys strutting around for?  Even if, by some miracle, there were peace and quiet tomorrow &#8211; what was it all for?  WMDs?  There were none.  Ties with al Qaeda?  Please.  To bring democracy to the Arab world and get rid of a source of instability?  We still don&#8217;t know whether democracy will happen, or whether Iraq will be a friend in the region.  But even if it comes to pass, wouldn&#8217;t both of these goals have been accomplished more easily and effectively by toppling the Saudi dictatorship?  Was what was accomplished, whatever it is that was accomplished, really worth the cost in blood and treasure to the Noemi Emorys of this world?</p>

<p>Inadequate staffing, poor retention, out-of-date technology and a lack of resources mar the FDA&#8217;s ability, the report by a subcommittee of the agency&#8217;s Science Board said.</p>
<p>(A copy of the 60-page report, FDA Science and Mission at Risk, can be found at http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/briefing/2007-4329b_02_00_index.html.)</p>
<p>&#8220;FDA&#8217;s inability to keep up with scientific advances means that American lives are at risk,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>The panel, chaired by Gail Cassell, vice president for scientific affairs at Eli Lilly &#038; Co., and representatives from Genentech Inc and Wyeth, among others presented their findings to FDA Commissioner Andrew Von Eschenbach and other agency officials.</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone tell GW.  Another round of tax cuts would fix the problem.</p>

<blockquote>Yue Minjun, in his Beijing studio, surrounded by self-portraits.  Did he borrow, or did he lend?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&#038;ct=us/0x-0&#038;fp=4757684e5bc5c0c9&#038;ei=5LpXR6bQNJ6arAOn9s35CQ&#038;url=http%3A//online.wsj.com/article/SB119690586945915304.html%3Fmod%3Dgooglenews_wsj&#038;cid=1124247340">The Not Paulson Bailout</a> is discussed in the Wall Street Journal.  I’m ordinarily skeptical of editorials in the WSJ, but not today.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Mr. Paulson&#8217;s nonplan would allow states to float more tax-exempt bonds to refinance subprime borrowers. State housing authorities can now float tax-exempts to help first-time home buyers, but Treasury wants to let them float bonds to refinance loans or pay closing costs as well. This is clearly a taxpayer-financed bailout.”</p>
<p>On the other side of the political street, “Right on time, Hillary Clinton weighed in with the truly awful idea of freezing subprime mortgage rates for five years &#8212; presumably, through the end of her re-election campaign in 2012. She&#8217;d combine price controls and contract repudiation &#8212; an Argentina double.”   And some 62% of Americans oppose a mortgage bailout plan.  Reason is 95% of Americans are making their payments on time and don’t want their tax money used to assist the irresponsible.  (I’m firmly in that camp.)</p>
<p>Freezing rates may make people happy temporarily, but makeshift solutions that don’t bring down real estate prices prolonged the S&#038;L loan crisis in the 1980’s and ended in the deflationary spiral that devastated the Japanese banking industry.  And the likelihood of default is high, even if interest rates are frozen.</p>
<p>There are many incentives for reckless lenders to cut a private deal with reckless borrowers, not least of which is the cost of a default on a mortgage.  Some people will have to start renting an apartment, as they should have done while saving up a proper down payment in the first place.  Where is the shame in that?  Only in the minds of the haughty.</p>
<p>One lesson in all this mess is clearest of all:  That the American Dream, if it is limited to buying a house and spending lots of money, is a fragile dream. </p>
<p>My own version of the American Dream doesn’t involve buying anything.  It involves getting a good education, working hard, and having the same chance as anyone else to succeed or fail.  It means becoming a liker of people and a lover of great ideas and a traveler in the world.  It means seeking to participate in the arc of great events as life moves from birth to death.  To achieve any small part of this American Dream means more than what I own.</p>
<p>How about you?</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/23/2325?query=TOC">The New England Journal of Medicine</a> printed an article worth reading about possible impacts of childhood obesity. I like the attitude. Here is the last part:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Certainly, we have much to learn about the regulation of body weight. Low-fat diets have yielded disappointing results, and very-low-carbohydrate diets appear to be more effective only in the short term. Novel approaches that focus on the quality rather than the ratio of macronutrients appear promising, and other areas warrant study, including the effects of sleep deprivation, stress, infectious agents, and endocrine-disrupting environmental toxins on weight. Unfortunately, the U.S. government has thus far invested only a fraction of a cent in research for every dollar that obesity costs society. And although broad consensus exists regarding the dietary and lifestyle habits needed to prevent and treat childhood obesity, we lack anything resembling a comprehensive strategy for encouraging children to eat a healthful diet and engage in physical activity. Such a strategy would include legislation that regulates junk-food advertising, provides adequate funding for decent lunches and regular physical activities at school, restructures the farm-subsidies program to favor nutrient-dense rather than calorie-dense produce, and mandates insurance coverage for preventing and treating pediatric obesity.<br />Parents must take responsibility for their children&#8217;s welfare by providing high-quality food, limiting television viewing, and modeling a healthful lifestyle. But why should Mr. and Ms. G.&#8217;s efforts to protect their children from life-threatening illness be undermined by massive marketing campaigns from the manufacturers of junk food? Why are their children subjected to the temptation of such food in the school cafeteria and vending machines? Why don&#8217;t they have the opportunity to exercise their bodies during the school day? And why must Mr. and Ms. G. fight with their insurance company for reimbursement to cover the costs of their children&#8217;s care at the OWL clinic? Fortunately, with the exercise of both personal and social responsibility, we have the power to choose the shape of things to come.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Heritage foundation claimed poor people are not malnourished because they are fat and should eat beans and rice.<br />The Farm Bill includes funding for WIC and food stamps as well as big subsidies for corn sugar and other yummy nourishing things, and actually discourages medium and small farmers from thriving.</p>
<p>Add in marketing costs for fast food, that tornado of deception, and pit it against each parent one at a time. So much for the &#8216;fair food fight and solely each parents concern&#8217; idealogy &#8211; what a convenient frame. Another deferred cost from our big corporations and government. My supply of Twinkies has diminishing returns and exploding liabilities. Darn.</p>

                                <p>Illegal means criminal, and alien feels spooky. Are spooky alien criminals invading the country?</p>
<p>And the <a href="http://www.ailf.org/ipc/ipc_index.asp">The American Immigration Law Foundation</a> tells us the likely reason why not:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The problem of crime in the United States is not &#8217;caused&#8217; or even aggravated by immigrants, regardless of their legal status. This is hardly surprising since immigrants come to the United States to pursue economic and educational opportunities not available in their home countries and to build better lives for themselves and their families. As a result, they have little to gain and much to lose by breaking the law. Undocumented immigrants in particular have even more reason to not run afoul of the law given the risk of deportation that their lack of legal status entails.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.blogger.com/:" nid="104&#038;sid=">This Thanksgiving</a> an illegal saved a American boys life at the cost of deportation.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Cordova was taken into custody by the U.S. Border Patrol and agreed to return to his home in the Mexican state of Sonora without going through formal deportation proceedings.</p>
<p>Cordova came to the border again Tuesday, where officials from both countries held the ceremony in a U.S. Customs and Border Protection building at the Nogales port of entry. His mother, Almalida Soberanes, looked on proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did what he had to do,&#8221; Soberanes said. &#8220;He took care of that little boy and protected him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The district director for U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., said Cordova deserved the opportunity to come to America to work and that the congressman plans to introduce legislation that will let him get a special visa. Such legislation rarely passes, but Grijalva aide Ruben Reyes said it was the only way they knew of to show their thanks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds more like a good neighbor than a criminal. And if the Presidential candidates changed the name, they would have to deal with WTO GATS trade style failures with our neighbors.</p>
<p>And the positive side of spooky aliens goes unnoticed.  Who wants to be known as an exploiter of refugees?</p>
<p>The term means nothing as a useful stereotype on which to build policy, and hides the failure of nations doing the trade NAFTA-CAFTA thing.  How convenient for all.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>A number of well-known financial firms are now under investigation for mortgage practices, among them Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p>Guess what firm is not on the list? Pick the premier financial firm, the one with the most connections, the one that could be said to be the leading edge of “shock” capitalism. &#8220;Goldman Sachs,&#8221; you say? Yup, you got it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/business/05cnd-wall.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">Andrew Cuomo</a>, Attorney General of New York, is looking into how all this toxic waste was cleverly bundled in SIV’s, CDO’s….</p>
<p>Now read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/business/02every.html?ei=5087&#038;em=&#038;en=beda266cc5d7f690&#038;ex=1197003600&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;pagewanted=2&#038;adxnnlx=1196875887-EuB1U4Gspz75oHWmpjrOFw">Ben Stein’s little complaint</a> about Goldman Sachs. Goldman was aggressivly pushing the stuff even as it shorted it! How innovative of them!</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The point to bear in mind, as Mr. Sloan brilliant makes clear, is that as Goldman was peddling C.M.O.’s, it was also shorting the junk on a titanic scale through index sales—showing, at least to me, how horrible a product it believed it was selling.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as Merrill Lynch once pushed dot.com garbage precisely at the time its analysts were pronouncing it worthless, just as Merrill Lynch is suspected of again doing the same, so Goldman Sachs has done it on a far grander scale.</p>
<p>Now, I do not share Ben Klein’s philosophy—being of a far more liberal bent&#8212;but Ben, kudos…an honest conservative. No flies on you. Ben goes further in his complaint:</p>
<blockquote><p>HERE is a query, as we used to say in law school: Should Henry M. Paulson Jr., who formerly ran a firm that engaged in this kind of conduct, be serving as Treasury secretary?</p></blockquote>
<p>How does Goldman Sachs do it? Well, there is one answer: Connections work. It is not for naught that Goldman Sachs has sired Secretaries of the Treasury, advisors to Presidents, governors… Read this little primer of Goldman Sachs, appearing in none other than <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,197554,00.html">Foxnews</a>.</p>
<p>As the cheery Fox story puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think what it does is creates a very strong voice for the role of the worldwide capital marketplace,&#8221; Langevoort said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, my. And, the Fox writer tells us that these altruistic scions of the financial world have gone on to public service because they want to give something back to the world that has been so very generous to them. Why Paulson has given $100 million to an environmental fund! Now, you would think, that should warm my green little heart. It doesn&#8217;t. It is all a p.r. game.</p>
<p>Yes, Paulson is &#8220;green&#8221;; Paulson is in charge of how to rescue the world from the financial toxic waste his former employer diligently spread around the world. Paulson, it is, who replied to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/opinion/03krugman.html?hp">Krugman</a>, that perhaps financial innovation got ahead of regulation.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Paulson would not have it any other way. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/">Slippery slopes make slippery monsters</a>.</p>
<p>And when those monsters are those in charge, those who design the game, play it, win it, and then reset the board with perhaps different rules, then we know we are in trouble. Keep the money rolling. The board will be reset; new rules; new game&#8230;but really the old game in a different form.</p>
<p>Why isn&#8217;t Goldman Sachs on Cuomo&#8217;s agenda? Merrill Lynch is now an easy target, with its CEO now in disgrace with his golden parachute. Deutche Bank, too, is in trouble; so, too, is Morgan Stanley. <i>The rule is: If you lose money, then you are shark bait.</i> Goldman played the game much better: It kept the money rolling in.</p>
<p>Again, why is Goldman Sachs not on Cuomo&#8217;s agenda? Because, fuzzy little liberal that he is, Cuomo goes after only guys already hit, already money losers, whose p.r. is now tarnished. It is all part of the game. Besides, teddy bear Cuomo knows where the real power is&#8211;and he is not tangling with that monster.</p>
<p>If Cuomo does not add Goldman Sachs to his list, I put Cuomo right up there on the slippery monster dias with Paulson. Let&#8217;s call him &#8220;Igor.&#8221; Goldman Sachs is the premier lobbyist, the granddaddy of them all. Is it any wonder, as Stein implies, that conspiracy theories surround this god of lobbyists?</p>
<p>When will we ever have public servants that actually look after the public&#8217;s interest?</p>

                                <p>About 1.4 million troops have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Pentagon research indicates that:</p>
<p>Up to 28% of combat troops may have been exposed to bomb blasts and suffered at least mild traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>30% of Iraq and Afghanistan casualties treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center have been diagnosed with mild, moderate or severe traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/zoroyaencl3.pdf?loc=interstitialskip">USA Today</a> carries a link to a memo the Armed Forces Epidemilogical Board sent to William Winkenwerder Jr., Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs at the Department of Defense, as regards diagnosis of levels of TBI and reasons for concern in combat and returning home. There is a list of what to look for in terms of symptoms and performance as well as behavior.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title38/title38.html">Title 38 USC 1110 Basic Entitlement</a></p>
<blockquote><p>For disability resulting from person injury suffered or disease<br />contracted in line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting<br />injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, in the<br />active military, naval, or air service, during a period of war, the United States will pay to any veteran thus disabled and who was<br />discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable<br />from the period of service in which said injury or disease was<br />incurred, or <strong>preexisting injury or disease was aggravated</strong>,compensation as provided in this subchapter, but no compensation shall be paid if the disability is a result of the veteran&#8217;s own <strong>willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The tangles of policy and money allocation, and entrenched viewpoints on the expectation of the diagnosis of malingering, need your thoughtfullness and input to the powers that be.</p>
<p>More will be posted as basic information. The military is trying to develop a blood test for in the field diagnosis based on released proteins from brain damage, and has about 200 stations that have basic scanning devices that feed into a central computer for diagnosis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the best treatment in support systems (family and buddies) is only just begun.</p>

<blockquote>In April 2007, William Winkenwerder Jr. retired from his position as assistant secretary for health affairs at the Department of Defense, where he had been in charge of all military healthcare. On June 1, he went to work for a Wisconsin-based private contractor named Logistics Health Inc., which hired him to serve on its board of directors and &#8220;advise and counsel LHI on business development,&#8221; according to a company press release. It was a hire that seems to have paid quick dividends.<br />On June 13, 2007, the Department of Defense began accepting bids for a contract to give soldiers medical and dental exams before they head off to war. Logistics Health was among the companies bidding on the contract, which was worth hundreds of millions of dollars over four years. Before he left the DOD, in addition to running military healthcare, Winkenwerder had also been in charge of the office that wrote the contract.</p></blockquote>
<p>The revolving door becomes direct access. Opportunity costs become part of procurement procedures and contract writing. I hope the company is efficient and does a good job at a reasonable cost.</p>

                                <p>This post is made up of two graphs and a few comments&#8230; </p>
<p>The first graph shows the annualized change in total individual income taxes paid (from the IRS Statistics of Income) as a percentage of personal income for selected blocks of years.  The data comes from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175814,00.html">IRS</a>.</p>

<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking&#8230; you&#8217;re wondering &#8211; weren&#8217;t there tax cuts in the early 1960s?  And weren&#8217;t taxes raised between 1988 and 1992?  Well, as I mentioned many times&#8230; there are two ways to cut taxes &#8211; one is to cut tax rates, and the other is to cut enforcement.  Presumably, there are also two ways to raise taxes.  And presumably, you get more compliance through enforcement than by writing rules and regulations.</p>
<p>The second graph shows the annualized change in real GDP per capita for the same selected blocks of years.  Data comes from the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">NIPA Table 7.1</a>.</p>

<p>A few comments:</p>
<p>1.  I don&#8217;t think many readers would argue that its a sheer coincidence that the red bars behave one way and the blue bars behave a different way in the first graph.  And yet, over the past year, every time I&#8217;ve put up a variation of the second graph, that&#8217;s exactly the argument that comes up &#8211; its a coincidence! <br />2.  Is it possible that the two graphs are related?  Is it possible that the reason all but one of the red bars is below the 2% line and all of the blue bars are above the 2% in the second graph have something to do with the pattern we observe in graph 1?  And if taxes hinder the economy&#8230; shouldn&#8217;t we see the opposite pattern in Graph 2?<br />3.  If graph 1 is unrelated to graph 2, what explains graph 2?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update.  It hasn&#8217;t been a good 12 hours&#8230;  I corrected item 2, which originally read the opposite of how it should.  Thanks to reader k harris for pointing out the error.</p>
<p>Update 2.  Grammatical correction in point 1 &#8211; thanks to Tom Mullins for pointing out the error.</p>
