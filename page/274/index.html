                                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://businesspublicpolicy.com/?p=953">Center for Business &#038; Public Policy</a> suggests some complications with public goods and taxes/fee for service in the case of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wpsdlocal6.com/news/local/Firefighters-watch-as-home-burns-to-the-ground-104052668.html">Obion county, Tenn. man and the fire department story</a>. One is freeriders, but there appears to be more than that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The city of South Fulton in Obion County, Tennessee, offers fire protection to households living outside of the city limits for a fee of $75 per year.  If you pay the fee, then if your house catches on fire, the fire department comes and puts it out.  If you don’t pay the fee, they don’t.  This sounds reasonable.  People living in the city limits pay city taxes for city services.  The city offers those services to people living outside the city limits when they can, but asks them to pay a share for them.  Some choose to pay the fee and others don’t.</p>
<p>&#8230;problems with voluntary provision of a public good.  If you ask people to voluntarily contribute toward a good like having a fire department or an army, the rational person says to himself “if everybody else pays, and I get protected even if I don’t pay, then why should I pay?” </p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Of course, if everyone thinks this way, nobody contributes, and nobody gets protected.  One solution, the one that South Fulton and other governments use, is to use their power of taxation to force people to contribute and then provide the service to everyone.  Another solution, also employed by South Fulton, is to find a way to exclude those who do not contribute from consuming the public good.  In this case, county residents who don’t pay the $75 fire fee do not get protected.  Of course, for that to provide people with proper incentives to contribute, you have to let their houses burn down if they actually do catch fire.</p>
<p>Finally, what are we to make of the owners’ offer to pay any price to have their house extinguished once the fire started?  Surely, there is some price at which it would be beneficial to the city to send out the fire department.  What about $20,000?  What about $30,000?  While there is certainly a number where the city would be foolish to pass up the opportunity, it might be rather high for a number of reasons.  </p>
<p>First, the city decided how large a fire department to build based on the number and location of households it has to protect.  Asking households to opt into fire protection probably helps with planning.  Second, there is the question of how price negotiations will take place while someone’s house is on fire.  Finally, there is the issue that someone whose house is currently on fire might not be in a position to enter into an agreement at all and may not have the assets necessary to pay the fire department’s ex post price.  My guess is that it might be possible to enter into agreements before that say “we opt out of paying the $75 but agree to pay $10,000 if the fire department has to come to our house,” but much more difficult to enforce a verbal agreement struck in a house on fire.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>There are several fascinating components to prospect theory, but the one that&#8217;s influenced me the most is also the simplest: when faced with a choice, people are far more motivated by loss aversion than by risk aversion.</p>
<p>Basically, what this means is that the emotional distress you suffer from losing, say, $100, is much greater than the emotional lift you get from winning $100. Losses always loom larger than gains.<br />&#8230;.<br />The power of loss aversion is one of those insights that seems painfully obvious after someone else points it out, and once you start looking for it you can see it in all walks of life. People are simply not willing to risk losing something they already have unless they&#8217;re promised a credible chance of a much larger gain. This explains a lot of otherwise odd behaviors&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce have proposed resurrecting, as a stimulus measure, the 2004 “dividend repatriation tax holiday,” which allowed firms to bring their foreigngenerated profits back to the United States at a greatly reduced tax rate. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this proposal would cost $1 billion over ten years.1</p>
<p>Yet the evidence shows that the 2004 tax holiday did little more than give windfall profits to a small number of large multinational corporations and did not lead to increased investment and jobs in the United States. Indeed, as a recent Goldman Sachs<br />analysis concluded, this idea is more likely to help corporations’ balance sheets than to stimulate demand.2</p>
<p>Resurrecting the tax holiday would also encourage corporations to shift profits and jobs out of the United States by increasing the tax advantages of foreign over domestic investment. That is likely why Congress, when it enacted the 2004 measure,<br />explicitly stated that it should be a one-time-only tax break that should not be repeated.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Promise Merchants</strong></p>
<p>Let me remind you what a very weird idea money is.</p>
<p>The IOU is a simple idea.  Money is like an IOU, but carried beyond<br />the boundary of reason into an entirely different and peculiar<br />territory.</p>
<p>If I write an IOU, it has my name on it, your name, perhaps a date,<br />and some indication of the future services which are owed between us.<br />It&#8217;s a minimalist contract, easy for anyone to understand.</p>
<p>But money is an IOU, a promise, with no names.  The future benefit is<br />merely an abstract number whose value is not defined.  A dollar does<br />not equal a loaf of bread, or an hour of babysitting, but is<br />determined by the usage of all the people who accept it.</p>
<p>This is almost theological in its weirdness.</p>
<p>This sort of a promise has value only to the extent that real goods<br />are delivered when promise-money is tendered, or the defaulter is<br />punished when they default on their promise.  An economy built on<br />promises &#8212; a capitalist economy &#8212; only functions when these promises<br />are enforced, and enforced multilaterally on all participants.</p>
<p>I have a significant advantage in a promise economy if I can enforce<br />the promises of others while defaulting on my own promises without<br />penalty.  If I can also unilaterally manufacture more promises that<br />others will honour, how cool is that?  Like counterfeiting, but<br />without the nuisance of avoiding the FBI.</p>
<p>Whose promise-breaking goes without penalty and whose is punished?<br />Whose stored-up promises are honoured or dishonoured,, and whose<br />multiply without effort? Those are the pivotal questions of a<br />capitalist economy.</p>
<p>Pensions are stored-up promises.  Workers build up a backlog of<br />promises to be honoured at the time they finish their working lives.<br />The agreement would be nonsense if they thought there was no way to<br />enforce that promise, especially since at the end of working life they<br />have little leverage of their own, and little time to spare for<br />legalities.</p>
<p>Businesses, not being alive nor having a fixed lifespan, body or<br />dwelling, have a huge advantage over individuals.  Given the power<br />differential, who can enforce such promises?  Organizations can<br />dishonour their promises to people, but if people try it they end up<br />bankrupt or in jail.</p>
<p>Barring violence by the cheated promisees, the government is the only<br />agent that can fulfill that role.</p>
<p>It’s not that the government stands behind one or another financial<br />institution – it stands behind them all.  It is the promise which<br />upholds all the other promises, for good or ill.</p>
<p>And when it fails in its duty, choosing to only enforce some<br />promise-keeping, not all, punish some counterfeiters, not all, it<br />chops at the roots of capitalism.  When they do this on behalf of<br />so-called capitalists, they are gnawing off the branch we are all<br />sitting on.</p>
<p>Because I think capitalism is marvelous, and necessary.  Its roots in<br />the realm of theological-strength nonsense allow us all to make<br />promises to each other over generations, to slosh our commonly<br />generated wealth around, and to mobilize the energy of our people in a<br />way that a mere sack of potatoes could never do.</p>
<p>But useful nonsense is only useful when controlled.  The weirder it<br />is, the more clear-eyed regulation it requires.  The Great Recession,<br />and the many bubbles preceding it, demonstrated what happens when the<br />balloon has no string.  It becomes a vanishing promise, last seen<br />drifting west over Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/10/defective-chinese-made-drywall-repairs-are-casualty-losses.html"><strong>Defective Chinese-made Drywall&#8211;safe harbor to claim repairs are casualty losses</strong></a></p>
<p>In IR 2010-102 (Sept. 30, 2010), the IRS announced that damages from corrosive drywall would be able to be treated as a casualty loss, and in Rev. Proc. 2010-36, there is a &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; formula for determining the amount of the loss.  The Rev Proc also provides a link to the Drywall Information Center, for guidance on identifying problem drywall.</p>
<p>The drywall, manufactured in China, has high levels of hydrogen sulfide and can result in corrosion of copper in appliances and wiring and high levels of gas.  If a taxpayer doesn&#8217;t have an existing or potential claim for reimbursement, the casualty loss is the unreimbursed repair cost; if there is a claim, the taxpayer may take 75% of the unreimbursed amount.   Amounts that increase the value of the house above its pre-loss value are not counted as part of the casualty loss.   Depending on the actual amount of the reimbursement, the taxpayer may have income or an additional deduction in the year of the reimbursement.  There are of course additional limitations to casualty loss claims:  only taxpayers who itemize may take casualty losses, the first 100 of the loss is not deductible, and the loss is only deductible to the extent that it exceeds 10% of adjusted gross income.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>Mike Kimel <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/10/empirical-look-at-us-economy-from.html">just remarked </a>that Keynes was in no way responsible for the incorrect impression that the Phillips curve graphs the set of unemployment and inflation rates available to policy makers.  In a comment, I said he was totally correct.   In fact, I&#8217;d go further and argued that Keynes warned against that mistake as clearly as he could given the disadvantage that he was writing decades before Phillips.</p>
<p>Also Mark Thoma has twice linked to my pathbreaking effor to study the history of eonomic thought by cutting and pasting from &#8220;The General Theory &#8230;.&#8221; </p>
<p>Said cutting and pasting after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Chapter 21. The Theory of Prices &#8220;</p>
<p>Contains the warning against the temptation to use a Phillips curve to come up with a theory of aggregate supply to go along with the theory of aggregate demand presented in chapters 1-18.  </p>
<blockquote><p>That the wage-unit may tend to rise before full employment has been reached, requires little comment or explanation. Since each group of workers will gain, cet. par. , by a rise in its own wages, there is naturally for all groups a pressure in this direction, which entrepreneurs will be more ready to meet when they are doing better business. For this reason a proportion of any increase in effective demand is likely to be absorbed in satisfying the upward tendency of the wage-unit.</p>
<p>Thus, &#8230; , we have a succession of &#8230; points at which an increasing effective demand tends to raise money-wages though not fully in proportion to the rise in the price of wage-goods; and similarly in the case of a decreasing effective demand. In actual experience the wage-unit does not change continuously in terms of money in response to every small change in effective demand; but discontinuously. These points of discontinuity are determined by the psychology of the workers and by the policies of employers and trade unions. &#8230; These points, where a further increase in effective demand in terms of money is liable to cause a discontinuous rise in the wage-unit &#8230; have &#8230;  a good deal of historical importance. But they do not readily lend themselves to theoretical generalisations.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is, the response of wages to aggregate demand in the real world is not smooth, simple or amenable to mathematical formalization.  In other words, don&#8217;t put a Phillips curve into your models.</p>
<p>Just to confirm Mike&#8217;s recollection, I will deal with a much more boring passage which uses strange notation invented by Keynes.  Other readers might want to quit hire.</p>
<p>As Mike Kimel recalled, Keynes also noted that the Phillips curve becomes vertical during a hyperinflation. Unfortunately he makes this point </p>
<p>Unfortunately it is expressed in terms of the obscure notation introduced in the first section of <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch20.htm">&#8220;Chapter 20. The Employment Function&#8221;</a> whose one redeeming feature is footnote 1. &#8220;Those who (rightly) dislike algebra will lose little by omitting the first section of this chapter.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The second half of chapter 20 isn&#8217;t all that much better, although it does include a presentation of the Lucas supply function, which is really the Keynes/Muth/Lucas supply function, for the case of clearning labor markets</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) For a time at least, rising prices may delude entrepreneurs into increasing employment beyond the level which maximises their individual profits measured in terms of the product. For they are so accustomed to regard rising sale-proceeds in terms of money as a signal for expanding production, that they may continue to do so when this policy has in fact ceased to be to their best advantage; i.e. they may underestimate their marginal user cost in the new price environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is some boring notation from  chapters 20 and 21.</p>
<p>e is the elasticity of prices with respect to the money supply.</p>
<p>e_d is the elasticity of money times velocity with respect to money.</p>
<p>e_w   =  (DdW )/(WdD) = the elasticity of nominal wages with respect to aggregate demand which equals MV.</p>
<p>we call money wages &#8220;nominal wages.&#8221;  In other words e_w (which isn&#8217;t necessarily constant) is the elasticity of the Phillips curve expressed in terms of employment not unemployment.</p>
<p>&#8220;the case of a &#8216;flight from the currency&#8217; in which e_d and e_w become large, e is, as a rule, less than unity.&#8221;</p>
<p>We call &#8216;flight from the currency&#8217; hyper-inflation.  Keynes is noting that money becomes neutral during hyperinflations.  This, as noted by Thomas Sargent in &#8220;The End of Four Big Inflations&#8221; which was published some time after &#8220;The General Theory &#8230;&#8221; proves that the Phillips curve is not an economic law.  The obscure quote confirms Mike Kimel&#8217;s vague recollection.</p>

                                <p><em><strong>Update:</strong> one of our readers caught a mistake in the chart. I indexed the data to December 2008, or one year after the recession actually started in December 2007. The statistics that changed are formatted in bold, and the chart in the article has been updated. The analysis doesn&#8217;t change at all, but the number of jobs lost during the recession is higher than those indicated in the original article.</em></p>
<p>From the NY Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/economy/03skills.html?_r=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">White House Plans Job Training Partnership</a> (bold by me):</p>
<blockquote><p>As part of efforts to address record-high levels of long-term unemployment, President Obama plans to announce a new national public-private partnership on Monday to help retrain workers for jobs that are in demand.</p>
<p>The national program is a response to frustrations from both workers and employers who complain that public retraining programs frequently do not provide students with employable skills. This new initiative is intended to help better align community college curriculums with the demands of local companies.</p>
<p>“The goal is to encourage community colleges and other training providers to work in close partnership with employers, to design a curriculum where they want to hire the people coming out of these programs right away,” said Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The White House has coined this program Skills for America&#8217;s Future. The complication is, that lack of skills is not the problem for the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm">66% of the labor force aged 25 years and over</a> without a bachelor&#8217;s degree. The problem is the lack of jobs.</p>

<p>The only category to recover employment in full is that requiring a Bachelor&#8217;s degree or higher. Furthermore, no material change in employment for BA&#8217;s (or higher) has occurred since about a year ago, as indexed employment hovers around 100. No new jobs.</p>
<p>The levels of employment for those workers with the lowest levels of educational attainment, 1. and 2., are <strong>10.2% </strong>and <strong>6.6%</strong> below pre-recession levels, respectively. That is <strong>over 3.5</strong> million jobs.</p>
<p>The White House program is targeted at community college students, or education category 3., some college or associate degree in the chart above. Employment for workers with a community college degree sits over <strong>3.2%</strong> below pre-recession levels, <strong>or 1.1 </strong>million jobs. Retraining workers will not raise the employment level further.</p>
<p>The government needs to &#8220;add jobs&#8221;, not &#8220;retrain workers&#8221;, and stimulate domestic aggregate demand.</p>

                                <p>by <strong>Linda Beale</strong><br />crossposted with Ataxingmatter</p>
<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/09/letting-rates-go-up-for-the-rich.html" target="_blank"><strong>Letting rates go up for the rich</strong></a></p>
<p>When I was asked by the New York Times to write a brief op-ed to counter arguments made in the Washington Post that the economy would be helped by cutting taxes for the rich (so that they stay the same as they were under the Bush temporary provision), I jumped at the chance. See <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/09/extending-the-tax-cuts-for-the-wealthy-the-discussion-continues.html" target="_blank">Extending the Tax Cuts for the Wealthy</a>&#8211;the discussion continues (ataxingmatter, with link to the New York Times Open Forum). It seems quite clear that the &#8220;trickle-down&#8221; theory that assumes that if you help the rich, the world will be better off for all the rest of us has been clearly proven wrong by the four decades that it has held sway over economic, tax and social policy in the United States, starting with the presidency of Ronald Reagan. We have not had the stellar growth in jobs and opportunities for the middle class workers that the &#8220;reaganomics revolution&#8221; promised for good reason&#8211;those policies simply give more to big business and the rich, and do nothing to assure that any growth that does occur is shared with the vast majority of ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>Some of the comments to that post were from people who made more than $250,000 a year, complaining that they were not rich and why should their taxes increase. As I noted in a comment on the Times website, this is a common occurrence. We humans measure ourselves by those around us. If you make $300,000 a year, you probably know lots of other people who make about $300,000 a year and then a few who are clearly even better off than you are, making a half a million or a million or more a year. Certainly, many of the partners at the law firms in New York make a million or so a year, so that associates who made $200 thousand or so a year may have felt that they were &#8220;not rich&#8221; in comparison to the rich partners with whom they worked. But the fact is, anyone making that much is in the very privileged set&#8211;just not necessarily in the absolutely most privileged set. Being privileged to decide whether to buy private horsebacking riding lessons in Manhattan or whether to have a private in-ground pool in your back yard or whether to send your children to one of the ritziest colleges in the northeast is to be rich. For those with average incomes, sending their children to any college at all is often an impossible dream, and all those &#8220;extras&#8221; that the well-to-do think of as &#8220;must haves&#8221; are pipedreams.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The New York Times article on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/business/30rich.html?_r=1&#038;emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y" target="_blank">Definition of Rich Now A Tax Issue</a>, New York Times (Sept. 30, 2010) spends a lot of time before it gets to that key point. Sure, some families that make more than $250,000 may think they identify more with people who make less than with multimillionaires. But odds are they haven&#8217;t really ever focused on what life is like for the majority of Americans who make less than half what they do. As Brad DeLong says in the article, those in the top 5% are comparing themselves to those in the top 2% rather than looking down at multitudes with less assets than they have. To quote DeLong:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is pathetic and embarrassing that somebody with five times the median household income, someone in the top 2 or 3 percent of the population, thinks of himself as just another &#8216;average Joe.&#8217; Why don&#8217;t you ask someone who makes $40,000 or $50,000 a year if they have a lot in common with a family making $250,000.</p></blockquote>
