<p>Martin Ford continues his thoughts on:</p>
<p>The Mythology of the Future Job Market</p>
<p>Angry Bear recently picked up an article by Michael Lind at Salon on the <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/feature/2009/11/02/healthcare_employment/index.html" target="_blank">jobs of tomorrow</a>. The story notes that advancing job automation technology is going to be the primary force that will shape the future job market. That’s something that I have also been <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/could-advancing-job-automation.html" target="_blank">talking about here</a>.</p>
<p>Lind’s article then goes on to do a pretty good job of fleshing out the conventional wisdom on where jobs are going to come from in the future:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most numerous and stable jobs of tomorrow will be those that cannot be offshored, because they must be performed on U.S. soil, and also cannot be automated, either because they require a high degree of creativity or because they rely on the human touch in face-to-face interactions. The latter are sometimes called &#8220;proximity services&#8221; and they include the fastest-growing occupations, healthcare and education.</p></blockquote>
<p>So we are led to expect that, over time, the bulk of the workforce is going to migrate into jobs that require creativity or innovation, or jobs that depend on uniquely human traits or talents. Furthermore, these new jobs are going to require that any innovation, creativity or personal attention occur pretty much while actually holding onto your customer’s hand—so that the job can’t be offshored. Is that really a likely scenario?</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that the two sectors singled out as being promising—healthcare and education—are by no means exempt from automation. Specific healthcare tasks are likely to be automated, while decision making and patient monitoring may migrate increasingly into expert systems. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Automation is clearly going to be a major factor in specialized, vocational-type education and training. Today in California, you can get your real estate license completely online. You won’t encounter an actual human being until you run into a proctor at the licensing exam. A similar thing has happened with the traffic school programs that drivers have to complete after getting a ticket. If training can be offered online, it will be. I see no reason why something similar won’t eventually occur in college education, especially since new graduates have been seeing a lower financial return on their investment. It seems likely that if the credential is worth less, many people will gravitate toward less expensive, automated online learning. </p>
<p>The biggest problem with the conventional wisdom is the number of jobs we are talking about. In the U.S. we have a workforce of around 140 million workers. The majority of these jobs are basically routine and repetitive in nature. At a minimum, tens of millions of jobs will be subject to automation, self-service technologies or offshoring. The automation process will never stop advancing: computer hardware and, perhaps most importantly, software will continue to relentlessly improve. Therefore, simply upgrading worker skills is not going to be a long-term solution; automation will eventually (and perhaps rapidly) catch up. If you are willing to look far enough into the future, the number of impacted jobs is potentially staggering. </p>
<p>Can we really expect that such an enormous number of these supposedly safe creative/“proximity service” jobs are going to materialize? And even if they do appear, can we reasonably anticipate that millions of workers who are now employed as cashiers, accounting clerks, materials movers—or even as college-educated “Dilberts”—are going to be able to successfully transition into those jobs? </p>
<p>Historically, the job market has always looked like a pyramid in terms of worker skills and capabilities. At the top, a relatively small number of highly skilled professionals and entrepreneurs have been responsible for most creativity and innovation. The vast majority of the workforce has always been engaged in work that is fundamentally routine and repetitive. As various sectors have mechanized or automated, workers have transitioned from routine jobs in one sector to routine jobs in another. In many cases, skills have been upgraded, but the work has nonetheless remained routine in nature. So, historically, there has been a reasonable match between the types of work required by the economy and the capabilities of the available workforce. </p>
<p>Now, as it becomes clear that automation is going to ultimately consume the entire base of the job skills pyramid, the conventional wisdom is that we are going to somehow cram everyone into the very top. And even if we somehow manage to do that, the jobs will be highly susceptible to offshoring, so we also have to require that the jobs be somehow anchored locally. I think this is somewhat analogous to having the agricultural sector mechanize and then expecting that everyone will get a job driving a tractor. The numbers don’t work. The problem with the conventional wisdom is that it underestimates the long-term impact of automation, and it expects too much in the way of occupational acrobatics from the average worker.</p>
<p>Yet another problem is that even if all these creative jobs materialize, the result would likely be far from optimal. Jobs that rely heavily on creativity, talent or unique personality traits (think authors, actors, musicians, commission sales people) very often have a power law income distribution. In other words, a few people do phenomenally well, while nearly everyone else struggles to survive. Even if vast numbers of workers could successfully migrate into these more creative areas (and I doubt that), it would probably do very little to slow down our drive toward ever-increasing income inequality. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that, at some point, we are all going to have to wake up to reality. It will be a long, arduous trek across the wasteland of denial, but someday all of us will have to start thinking the unthinkable and saying the unsayable: The jobs of the future…are not going to be there. Jobs are disappearing, and we will have to somehow adapt to that. In the long run, the solution will likely have to involve some type of job sharing, and it will also have to incorporate income supplementation for most people. It’s almost impossible to imagine how that will happen in a world that includes Fox News, but I think it will nonetheless have to happen. Perhaps the chances of it happening will improve when conservatives and business owners begin to recognize that workers and consumers are basically the same people and that the vast majority of consumer spending is supported by wage income. </p>
<p>The good news, though, is that you can ignore all this because it’s wrong. Many economists will tell you so. Ask any well-regarded economist such as Krugman, DeLong, Mankiw or Thoma. None of them are really worried about this, or if they are, they’re certainly not talking about it. They may nibble at the edges of this issue. Yes, we might have some structural unemployment for a few years while the economy adjusts and new jobs are created, but, no, jobs aren’t going to disappear. The economy always creates jobs; it gravitates toward full employment. </p>
<p>Why? Because it always has. Economists have studied it and analyzed reams of data from the past. They’ve built mathematical models, and the models say there will be jobs. It’s a rule. Hundreds of years ago there were lots of jobs for guys who shoveled coal into steam engines. Now those jobs are gone, and we all have jobs that people back then could never have imagined. It will be the same this time around. So don’t worry. And leave a cookie out on Christmas Eve. Santa might be hungry. <br />______________________________________________________<br />Martin Ford is the author of <a href="http://www.thelightsinthetunnel.com/" target="_blank">The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future</a> and has a blog at <a href="http://econfuture.wordpress.com/">econfuture.wordpress.com</a>.</p>

<p>Industrial production only increased 0.1% in October, from a previosly estimated 98.5 to 98.6.<br />But I suspect this number was biased downward and will be revised higher.</p>
<p>As the chart shows, this changes the impression the previous reports had given that this was a normal to strong recovery in industrial output to one that it is a weak recovery.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SwMCO5CBeSI/AAAAAAAAA-U/7MNJ8oVY0do/s1600/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SwMCO5CBeSI/AAAAAAAAA-U/7MNJ8oVY0do/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />A primary reason industrial production appears so weak is that October auto and light truck output fell to 6.83 million vehicles as compared to 7.15 million in September and a cyclical low of 4.05 million in June.  However, as the production of all items excluding autos and high technology was unchanged in October the weakness appears to be widespread.</p>
<p>However, I am suspicious that this report overstates the weakness and will be revised up as other information is included and revised data is reported.</p>
<p>Much of the initial estimates of monthly industrial production data is based on electricity consumption data.  However, the national average temperature days for October 2009 were extremely low at only 50.8 degrees Fahrenheit. In a quick check of my data base this is the second lowest October reading on record going back to 1921.  The lowest was 49.4 degrees in 1925 and the only one I saw below 50 &#8212; the highest was 60.0 in 1963.  The norm is around 55 degrees so the October temperature days was some 10% below normal.  This strongly implies that the electricity usage would have been significantly below normal in October and consequently the industrial production data estimates are undoubtedly biased downward.</p>

<p>Since ratings are essentially answering the question &#8220;Should I expect to receive full payment on this security?&#8221; the previous proclivity to rate paper AAA based on the idea that the U.S. Government would make investors whole in the case of a crisis* contributed to rating inflation.</p>
<p>This change is a welcome first step.</p>
<p>*This is essentially the same scenario as all the lendings that caused the S&#038;L crisis: &#8220;we think the land has oil in it&#8221; so it&#8217;s worth $X. So the banks lent X. And the land very often didn&#8217;t have oil in it. So $X had been given for a dust pile in West Texas around which the also oilless land was selling, if at all, for Y, X>>Y.  Oops.</p>

<p>Not only is ER care enormously expensive for &#8216;more routine&#8217; health concerns than a clinic, but perhaps are not equal for insure/uninsured even for traffic accidents, not withstanding our best wishes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sphere.com/2009/11/16/trauma-victims-face-far-worse-odds-when-uninsured-study-says/" target="_blank">Sphere</a> notes a report from the <a href="http://archsurg.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/144/11/1006?home" target="_blank"><i>Archives of Surgery</i></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s federal law: All seriously injured emergency and trauma patients must be given equal lifesaving care, whether or not they can pay for it. But that&#8217;s not happening, according to a new report. The study, conducted by Children&#8217;s Hospital Boston research fellow Dr. Heather Rosen and colleagues from three other hospitals, found that uninsured trauma victims ages 18 to 30 are dying at an annual rate 89 percent higher than insured victims with identically severe injuries. </p>
<p>As the health reform tornado continues to swirl on Capitol Hill, the data could provide fresh ammunition for those pushing for expanded health insurance coverage. </p>
<p>The study, published today in the Archives of Surgery, examines the survival rates for patients brought to about 900 U.S. trauma centers between 2002 and 2006, analyzing some 690,000 patients who had suffered penetrating trauma &#8212; such as wounds inflicted by a gun or knife &#8212; or blunt trauma from vehicle crashes and falls. Earlier research found 18,000 extra deaths a year among uninsured victims of such injuries. Rosen and the other researchers chose to focus on the 18-to-30-year-old subset because they had fewer existing conditions &#8212; comorbidity &#8212; that muddy the evaluation of the cause of death.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>[snip]<br />
<blockquote>In a comment published with the journal article, Dr. Brent Eastman, a trauma and vascular surgeon from Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego who was just elected chairman of the Board of Regents of the American College of Surgeons, noted that emergency rooms and trauma centers &#8220;are the safety net for many communities.&#8221; He called for Rosen&#8217;s conclusions to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Rosen cautions that the definitive cause for the higher death rate for uninsured people remains to be determined. Still, the hard number &#8212; the nearly 90 percent jump in mortality rates for uninsured accident victims &#8212; speaks loudly on its own. &#8220;Although the lack of insurance may not be the only explanation,&#8221; she says, &#8220;the accidental costs of being uninsured in the United States today may be too high to continue to overlook.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>I <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/11/cms-report-revisited">paraphrase</a> Kevin Drum </p>
<blockquote><p>My post last night about the CMS report on healthcare reform &#8230; [was not] a model of clarity.  For more, see <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/11/cms_house_bill_great_on_covera.html">Ezra Klein here </a> and <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/11/does_health-care_reform_do_eno.html">Jon Gruber here</a>.  Combined with &#8230; <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/11/what-cms-report-says">[Drum&#8217;s original] post</a> and <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/11/15/cms-report/">this Wonk Room post</a>, you should get a pretty good idea of what&#8217;s up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin Drum&#8217;s orginal post is much clearer than mine and makes the point I tried to make in the last paragraph.</p>
<p>After the jump I have further thoughts.</p>
<p>I quote from the wonk room post </p>
<blockquote><p>CMS doubts that the health care industry could “improve their own productivity to the degree achieved by the economy in large” and predicts that the productivity adjustments in the House bill could lead some Medicare providers “for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive portion of their business” to stop seeing Medicare patients. </p></blockquote>
<p>First I note again, the unrealistic productivity estimates are used to calculate Medicare compensation for institutional care providers (hospitals, nursing homes and home health care agencies) not physicians in private practice.  This is important, because physicians in private practice are much more likely to refuse Medicare patients.  </p>
<p>Second I ask if CMS chief actuary Foster is familiar with economics 101.  The clause “for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive portion of their business” makes negative sense. (I&#8217;m trusting Wonk Room&#8217;s Igor Volsky to have quoted without removing necessary context.  I haven&#8217;t gone back to the pdf.)</p>
<p>As usual, I start with a very unrealistic economics 101 model.  I assume that hospitals aim to maximize profits (totally false).   In that case, hospitals will accept Medicare patients if the fee is below marginal cost.  Marginal cost is increasing along the relevant range.  Consider hospital A and hospital B (assume they have the same number of beds and same marginal cost as a function of patient population for simplicity).  A does a lot of business with the CMS, B just a little.  If A refuses Medicare patients, then the reduction in its patient population will be greater than that of hospital B if hospital B refuses Medicare patients.  This means that the average marginal cost of treating the patients it turns away will be lower.  This means that it can&#8217;t be profit maximizing for A to turn away medicare patients and for B to treat them.</p>
<p>Consider the extreme case of a hospital with only Medicare patients.  If it refuses CMS rates it will have zero revenues and go bankrupt.  Consider the extreme case of a hospital with no Medicare patients.  Refusing to treat Medicare patients makes no difference at all.  </p>
<p>OK so ospitals, including for profit hospitals, are not profit maximizing entities (I think no firms are).  However, I don&#8217;t think that there are hospitals with many Medicare patients which can afford to refuse Medicare compensation.  Note they still have to provide emergency care (by law) and they can not bill the Medicare patients rather than the CMS (If they accept CMS payment, then they can charge patients up to 15% in addition to what they get from the CMS with or without reform).  </p>
<p>The logic of Foster&#8217;s argument is that hospitals which have lots of medicare patients will go bankrupt if the HR3692 is enacted and the limits are actually enforced.  This logic is invalid, because the increase in insurance coverage implies more revenues for hospitals.  One can&#8217;t consider money from the CMS alone when considering whether a hospital goes bankrupt.  </p>
<p>The relative rates CMS vs other are relevant to the choice of refusing to deal with the CMS.  I think this would be financial suicide for the average hospital even if the cuts in CMS rates are enacted and not waived.  Only hospitals who have few Medicare patients could afford to refuse to treat Medicare patients.  </p>
<p>Basically, I think Foster is confusing marginal and average costs.  He decides that if you lose money in an accounting sense doing something, then you have higher profits if you don&#8217;t do it.  That assumes that capital costs and overhead decline proportionally to patient population.  That is a plainly false assumption and the inference based on it is nonsense.</p>

                                <p>Bob Somerby has been on a rant at <a target="_blank" href="http://dailyhowler.com/">The Daily Howler</a> that &#8220;liberals&#8221; do not understand the Stupak Amendment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, claims he makes about Rachel Maddow and Keith Olbermann and their guests do not apply to Laurie Rubner.  At the Health Affairs blog, <a target="_blank" href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2009/11/16/health-reform-and-abortion-the-stupak-amendment-hurts-women/">Ms. Rubner is direct and to the point</a>:<br />
<blockquote>From the very beginning, a central tenet of health care reform was that no one would lose coverage they already have. That’s why so many women are outraged by the Stupak amendment to the health reform legislation recently passed by the House.  It goes against one of the fundamental tenets of health care reform: do not leave anyone worse off than they were before reform&#8230;.</p>
<p>The Stupak amendment extends the group of women ineligible for abortion coverage far beyond its current breadth. It is essentially a middle-class abortion ban. The exchange would offer coverage to many of the 17 million women ages 18–64 who are uninsured, along with the 5.7 million women who are now purchasing coverage in the individual market. In addition, small employers are also likely to purchase their health insurance through the exchange where they may find more affordable options. Because the majority of health insurance plans in the private insurance market currently include abortion, many women will lose coverage that they already have in an exchange where abortion coverage is not permitted.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Stupak Amendment is, among its other ills, <strong>not</strong> Pareto-optimal.</p>
<p>I wait—patiently, of course—for <a target="_blank" href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/">Andrew Samwick</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/">Greg Mankiw</a> or even Sensible Centrist Economists such as <a target="_blank" href="http://delong.typepad.com/">Brad DeLong</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/">Mark Thoma</a> to denounce the Stupak Amendment as a violation of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_welfare_theorem">First Welfare Theorem</a>.</p>

<p>The weather was beautiful on the day I was almost murdered.  Since it happened (or almost happened) in Brazil, it might not seem surprising that the weather was nice, but this was São Paulo where the only certainty is pollution.  Beautiful days in São Paulo are worth noting, even when you barely make it through them alive.  </p>
<p>The events of that day are not something I talk about much, and I doubt I have ever written about them.  But I&#8217;ve been thinking about the murders committed last week by Major Nidal Malik Hasan.  See, the guy who almost killed me &#8211; and I&#8217;ll call him G, has a similar ethnic background, though he hailed from a point a few hundred miles and a border crossing away from where Hasan originated. </p>
<p>But there are some differences, or at least were, between G and Hasan.  Hasan was in the U.S., and apparently was an American citizen.  G was neither.  But I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s still true.  It is my understanding that G is now in the U.S., and may have acquired American citizenship. The reason I don&#8217;t know with absolute certainty is that G&#8217;s last name is kind of common in the Middle East, and his first name &#8211; always popular in the Middle East &#8211; became doubly so after an extremely anti-American &#8220;warrior&#8221; made a name for himself through the sort of spectacular failure that is so widely revered in the region.  </p>
<p>G&#8217;s problem with me was that I was Israeli.  Except that I wasn&#8217;t.  To this day, I&#8217;ve never been to Israel.  But I am Jewish, and an American, and apparently, to G, there is/was no difference between an American Jew and an Israeli.  His problem with Israelis seemed to stem largely from the fact that the Israelis sided with the Christians during one of the Lebanese Civil Wars.  Which brings up a wider issue &#8211; I don&#8217;t think he was all that fond of any non-Muslims.  Or what he&#8217;d call non-Muslims, but which would probably be better termed non-Islamists.  (And there is a big difference.)  I barely knew anything about him, never associated with him, and generally avoided him, but it was obviously he was pretty pissed off at the world around him. </p>
<p>And its also pretty obvious that G is not unique in disliking non-Islamists.  Yet plenty of people fitting precisely that description (i.e., disliking non-Islamists and all that the West seems to stand for) appear to have no problem coming here, as much as they despise this country and its residents.   But that kind of internal fucked-uppedness is not uncommon.  Hasan could get his jollies at a strip club while mentally and metaphorically applying oil to the cleansing blade of the One True Faith. </p>
<p>The flip-side of the equation is the problem for me.  Just because some people who are messed up in the head can maintain positions that are internally contradictory doesn&#8217;t mean we should facilitate the process.  After all, as its been noted many times, the Constitution is not a suicide pact.  We as a people have no requirement to allow extremists into the country whose goal is to kill us.  A bit of digging to ensure we don&#8217;t let in people who believe Americans in general are evil and deserve to die because of their faiths or behaviors would not be unreasonable.</p>
<p>In fact, it should be a flat out question asked of those who would come to the U.S.  &#8220;OK&#8230; Next question&#8230; Do you think the infidels should die? Yes or no?&#8221;  (FYI, my father immigrated from Argentina, and I don&#8217;t believe that was a question he was asked.)  In fact, getting a citizenship should be a bit like a contract, and one of the terms of the contract has to be that citizenship gets revoked and you have twenty minutes to be on the next plane out if you join some organization for which &#8220;Death to America&#8221; is a rallying cry.</p>
<p>Engaging in such a policy would be discriminatory.  I bet it would be opposed by organizations like CAIR.  But we already discriminate.  A few years ago, my first cousin and her family (from Argentina) were living in Mexico City, as her husband&#8217;s job had transferred them there for a few years.  They wanted to come to the US to visit family and do some tourism, and they had the funds to do so (which would have helped the US economy).  The problem was they couldn&#8217;t get a visa; apparently people with well-paying jobs abroad are viewed as having an almost uncontrollable desire to overstay tourist visas and seek out lucrative positions picking lettuce in Novato, CA or busing tables in some no-name place forty miles from Lincoln, Nebraska.  Or something.</p>
<p>The source of discrimination, when it comes to immigration and tourism, is that more people want to come to the US than can fit at any one time without killing the goose that lays the golden eggs, so to speak.  So if we&#8217;re going to discriminate anyway, shouldn&#8217;t we at least try to differentiate between our friends and our enemies?<br />______________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p>Robert goes out on a limb and guesses that Lori Montgomery fell for (or is pushing) Republican spin in this article in the Washington Post<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/14/AR2009111402597.html?hpid=topnews">Report: Bill would reduce senior care<br />Medicare cuts approved by House may affect access to providers</a></p>
<blockquote><p>A plan to slash more than $500 billion from future Medicare spending &#8212; one of the biggest sources of funding for President Obama&#8217;s proposed overhaul of the nation&#8217;s health-care system &#8212; would sharply reduce benefits for some senior citizens and could jeopardize access to care for millions of others, according to a government evaluation released Saturday.</p>
<p>The report, requested by House Republicans, found that Medicare cuts contained in the health package approved by the House on Nov. 7 are likely to prove so costly to hospitals and nursing homes that they could stop taking Medicare altogether. </p>
<p>Congress could intervene to avoid such an outcome, but &#8220;so doing would likely result in significantly smaller actual savings&#8221; than is currently projected, according to the analysis by the chief actuary for the agency that administers Medicare and Medicaid.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have read <a target="_blank" href="http://republicans.waysandmeans.house.gov/UploadedFiles/OACT_Memorandum_on_Financial_Impact_of_H_R__3962__11-13-09_.pdf">the report </a>(warning pdf) &#8230; well actually up to the passage stressed by Republicans and Montgomery.  Montgomery&#8217;s article focuses on one paragraph deep in the report which begins &#8220;It is important to note that the estimated savings for one category of Medicare proposals may be unrealistic.&#8221;  That&#8217;s some serious digging.  </p>
<p>The paragraph goes on to discuss what seems to be new additional budgetary flimflam which is assuming that productivity in hospitals and nursing homes grows at the national average (measured productivity grows much more slowly and it doesn&#8217;t matter if  this is due to unmeasured improved quality of care).  That would be part of a large savings of $ 282 billion.  The report doesn&#8217;t describe what the savings would be if Medicare rates were adjusted to a reasonable forecast of productivity growth.</p>
<p>Now I had assumed that Medicare cuts other than eliminating the Medicare advantage boondoggle were reductions in money effectively given to hospitals (and nursing homes etc) so they could afford to take care of the uninsured.  Hospitals&#8217; budgets will be affected by increased health insurance coverage, both by the increases in the total fraction of people insured and the fraction of people with pre-existing conditions insured.  This means that the total effect on Hospitals&#8217; budgets can&#8217;t be calculated assuming only Medicare payment rates change.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Foster (the author) assumes that reduced Medicare payments will cause hospitals to choose to refuse Medicare patients and not drive Hospitals bankrupt.  It is true that relatively lower Medicare rates will cause more hospitals to refuse Medicare patients.  How many currently do?  I googled <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.it/search?hl=en&#038;safe=off&#038;q=%22hospitals+which+refuse+medicare%22&#038;btnG=Search&#038;aq=f&#038;oq=">&#8220;hospitals which refuse medicare&#8221;</a> I got links to articles about physicians who refuse Medicare patients and <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.poz.com/index.php?topic=15113.0;wap2">this link</a> to someone who works at a hospital where they talked about refusing Medicare patients.</p>
<p>Medicare rates are already low.  There sure don&#8217;t seem to be many hospitals which refuse to treat Medicare patients.  </p>
<p>OK so I tried the past tense and googled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.it/search?hl=en&#038;source=hp&#038;q=%22hospital+did+not+accept+medicare%22&#038;btnG=Google+Search&#038;aq=f&#038;oq=">&#8220;hospital did not accept medicare&#8221;</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://forums.obgyn.net/womens-health/WHF.9808/0665.html">This link to someone who says an anonymous hospital told her in 1998 that they didn&#8217;t accept Medicare patients.</a></p>
<p>Quite frankly this doesn&#8217;t seem to be a huge problem.  The idea that it will get even bigger if Medicare rates fall further below other rates doesn&#8217;t seem to me to merit page 1 treatment.</p>
<p>I think Foster is saying that he believes that the new restrictions on Medicare compensation will be waived just as the existing restrictions are waived.  He can&#8217;t say that Congress is flimflamming so he has to explain how this might be a natural response to unforeseen events in the future. My current guess is that the event will be the perfectly foreseeable complaints from hospitals and nursing homes and that the forecast that Congress will waive the rule is the only forecast a responsible actuary can make.  </p>
<p>The Republican/Montgomery/www.washingtonpost.com headline guy spin that elderly people will be denied care if the bill passes is absurd.  If that&#8217;s the way things worked, the 1997 rule wouldn&#8217;t be waived year after year.</p>
<p>There don&#8217;t seem to be many reports of hospitals refusing Medicaid either.<br />No google hits for &#8220;hospital refuses medicaid&#8221; one for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.it/search?hl=en&#038;safe=off&#038;q=%22hospital+refused+medicaid%22&#038;btnG=Search&#038;aq=f&#038;oq=">&#8220;hospital refused medicaid&#8221;</a>  to <a href="http://209.85.135.132/search?q=cache:ERTPt2Vg9R8J:www.ncpa.org/email/State_HC_Reform_6-8-07.pdf+%22hospital+refused+medicaid%22&#038;cd=1&#038;hl=en&#038;ct=clnk&#038;gl=it&#038;lr=lang_en">a publication </a>of the National Center for Policy Analysis. Hmmm, where have I heard of that? <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/18/politics/18bartlett.html?_r=1"> It&#8217;s the so called think tank which fired Bruce Bartlett for heresy</a>.  </p>
<p>The document to which I link asserts that Veterans care is queue rationed and that the veterans administration does provide as high quality care as that available to people with private insurance.  Non ideological sources rate the veterans administration as the best care provider &#8212; number one.</p>
<p>I think that &#8220;Hospitals will refuse Medicare and/or Medicaid&#8221; is a serious policy concern on a level similar to the &#8220;tax cuts cause increased revenues.&#8221;  And here it is on the front page of www.washingtonpost.com.</p>
<p>Update:  Note I am writing about <strong>hospitals</strong> who refuse Medicare not doctors in private practice who refuse Medicare.  My googling and questions were on <strong>hospitals</strong> which refuse medicare and/or medicaid.  Of the first 7 comments, 5 discussed office based practices which refuse medicare.  By my count letters &#8220;hospital&#8221; appear in that order 18 (eighteen) times in the post (sometimes followed immediately by an s).  Somehow commenters seem to have overlooked all 18 (eighteen) of them.  </p>
<p>This is not a quibble. The provision of the bill which Foster suspects will not be actually applied concerns &#8220;institutional&#8221; providers of health care not physicians in private practice.  I quote from his report </p>
<blockquote><p>H.R. 3962 would introduce permanent annual productivity adjustments to price updates for <strong>institutional</strong> providers (such as acute car <strong>hospitals</strong>, skilled <strong>nursing facilities</strong>, and home health <strong>agencies</strong>) using a 10-year moving average of economy-wide productivity gains.  [skip] end participation in the program (possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries).  </p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s why I asked about Hospitals refusing medicare patients.  There is a big difference between squeezing the entities which can&#8217;t be squeezed and squeezing those which can be squeezed (provided they are getting a lot more money due to increased insurance coverage so they won&#8217;t go bankrupt).</p>
