<p>Humor:</p>
<p>This little video resonated with some of my thoughts on the MA Senate election and responses in the media.  The little guy/gal is MA.  Where the startle goes remains to be seen&#8230;</p>

<p>Two &#8220;R&#8221;s in the news: Rachel Alexandra and Rudolf Elmer&#8211;Swiss banks, hedge funds? assist with tax evasion<br />Maybe the world is looking up.  A filly has won the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year, by a whopping 130 votes to second runner Zenyatta&#8217;s 90 votes.  I&#8217;ve always had a soft spot in my heart for horses, and especially for fillies.  Comes from growing up visiting my country cousins in Tennessee, where my favorite part of the visit was getting to ride old Dan or some other horse.</p>
<p>And Rudolf Elmer is doing his bit, too, to add some cheer to the day.  He&#8217;s the banker who worked for Swiss bank Julius Baer until he was fired in 2002 and has spent time sense sharing with the world the nefarious deeds of some of the Swiss institutions who have helped clients evade billions in taxes through uses of offshore havens.  Says Rudolf &#8220;Offshore tax evasion is the biggest theft among societies and neighbor states in this world.&#8221;  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/business/19whistle.html">Swiss Banker Blows Whistle on Tax Evasion</a>, New York Times, Jan 19, 2010</p>
<p>Elmer is flying to Germany where he is planning to blow the whistle even louder on Swiss banking assistance for tax evasion.  The German authorities are &#8220;putting him up in a five-star hotel&#8221; but you can bet the U.S. authorities are eagerly probing his show and tell&#8211;apparently documents covering more than 1300 individuals and 100 trusts over five years that &#8220;detail the undisclosed role of American investment management companies in funneling American, European and South American clients who wished to avoid taxes to Julius Baer.&#8221;  Elmer&#8217;s no saint, obviously, but the IRS strategy is described as &#8220;it takes a rogue to catch a thief&#8221; (echoes of television&#8217;s crime dramas).  </p>
<p>The hiding places for all those wealthy tax scoflaws who thought they could just slip their millions into the shadows may not be much good these days.  Further, the possible complicity of hedge and private equity firms in assisting tax evasion should, if verified, be the final nail in the coffin of the privileged &#8220;carried interest&#8221; taxation of hedge and equity fund managers&#8217; compensation.</p>

<p>How are the data presented? At an annual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly frequency? At the onset of the New Year, you will undoubtedly see many charts illustrating records broken in 2009 using annual measures. This is always fun (from a data junkie&#8217;s point of view), but it only tells the reader where we were, on average in many cases, rather than where we are now! Quarterly data are the same story &#8211; often presented well after the culmination of the period.</p>
<p>Alternatively, monthly data are a little more telling but still lagged by at least one month. For example, the employment report is the first major economic release of the month, which sets the stage for many subsequent releases. However, by the release date, generally the first Friday of the month, the survey information is already one month old.</p>
<p>This leaves weekly, or even daily, data. High-frequency data can tell us &#8220;where we are now&#8221;, but are subject to substantial volatility. Nevertheless, high-frequency data are quite informative at economic turning points. So where are we?</p>
<p>Here are three high-frequency indicators that show an improving labor market, as illustrated by initial claims and daily tax receipts. However, the money multipliers remain at historically low levels, signaling that consumer spending and credit growth continues to elude monetary policymakers.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The weekly initial claimant count is dropping off quickly. So far, the 4-week moving average is 33% off its peak, a definite positive. And comparing to previous recoveries, the claimant count does suggest that this recovery will look more like a job-plus, rather than a job-less recovery.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S1bv7TdeobI/AAAAAAAACx0/TZyveVDD3Do/s1600-h/claims_chart.png"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S1bv7TdeobI/AAAAAAAACx0/TZyveVDD3Do/s400/claims_chart.png" border="0"></a>However, don&#8217;t get too excited &#8211; an awful lot of jobs <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/adee832e-052b-11df-a85e-00144feabdc0.html">need to be created each month</a> just to drop the unemployment rate.</p>
<p>The stabilization of the labor market is likewise seen in the <a href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/dts/">Treasury&#8217;s daily tax receipts</a>. Daily receipts have stabilized, and are now growing, off of their lows.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S1bv72naI6I/AAAAAAAACyE/k7gB40fA1U4/s1600-h/receipts_chart.png"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S1bv72naI6I/AAAAAAAACyE/k7gB40fA1U4/s400/receipts_chart.png" border="0"></a>High-frequency monetary aggregate indicators show that traditional Fed policy &#8211; increasing bank reserves through open market operations &#8211; is not flowing into the economy as new money for spending on goods and services. Money multipliers of all types are half of what they were just two years ago (dropping even lower in recent months).</p>
<p>This is the bane of the Fed&#8217;s policy existence during and in the aftermath of the banking crisis. Inflation is not going to be a problem until this money clog frees up.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S1bv7gSQmFI/AAAAAAAACx8/EnJZh4yNBYI/s1600-h/multipliers_chart.png"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S1bv7gSQmFI/AAAAAAAACx8/EnJZh4yNBYI/s400/multipliers_chart.png" border="0"></a>There is widespread stabilization, and even improvements, as shown by the high-frequency economic data. Perhaps I will follow up this post on the remaining weekly data, like on credit extension and housing.</p>

<p>Unless we can count on AARP supporters like you to flood their senators with calls right now – there&#8217;s still a chance they will pass this dangerous amendment. </p>
<p>If they do, a special commission would then have fast-track power to propose drastic cuts to the programs that millions of seniors depend on to survive: Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.</p></blockquote>

<p>Please share with your lists and grassroots! Thanks!<br />www.youtube.com/owlnational<br />www.socialsecuritymatters.org</p>
<p>&#8220;Say NO to the Fast-Track Commission&#8221;<br />National Call-In Day &#8211; January 19, 2010 &#8211; # 1.800.998.0180<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Contact: Anne Bollinger<br />Phone: 202.719.0725<br />Visit: www.socialsecuritymatters.org</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, DC &#8211; On Tuesday, January 19, 2010 OWL, AFSCME Retirees,<br />AFT Program on Retirement and Retirees, Alliance for Retired<br />Americans, American Association of University Women, Generations<br />United, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare,<br />National Senior Citizens Law Center, NOW, Pension Right Center, Wider<br />Opportunities for Women (WOW) and several other national organizations<br />are calling on their members to flood the Senate with phone calls<br />against the Conrad-Gregg Fast Track Commission proposal.</p>
<p>Senators Conrad (D-ND) and Gregg (R-NH) have come up with a special<br />fast-track commission that they say will cure America&#8217;s budget<br />problems, and they are holding up other legislation until the Senate<br />votes on their proposal. Debate begins on January 20th.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is clear from their press release that Senators Conrad and Gregg<br />have painted a big red target on Social Security and Medicare,”<br />Senator Baucus (D-MT) warned. &#8220;That&#8217;s what this commission is all<br />about. It&#8217;s a big roll of the dice for Social Security and Medicare.&#8221;</p>
<p>This type of fast-track commission is undemocratic and takes power<br />away from Congress to make decisions about Social Security. Social<br />Security does not contribute to the national debt; it is insurance<br />that workers have earned through their hard work.</p>
<p>Social Security is fundamental to the economic security of all<br />Americans, particularly women, seniors, minorities, the disabled<br />children who lose a parent, people who lose a spouse, and veterans.</p>
<p>&#8220;The average Social Security recipient receives $13,860 annually, less<br />if you are a woman. The fact that Senators Conrad and Gregg think the<br />way to fix budget shortfalls is to make seniors poorer is shocking and<br />laughable &#8211; first, because Social Security doesn&#8217;t contribute in any<br />way to the national deficit, and second, because essentially Congress<br />has allowed $150 billion in Wall Street bonuses,&#8221; stated, Ashley<br />Carson, OWL Executive Director. &#8220;Robbing grandma to reward Wall<br />Street fat cats is not sound economics.&#8221;</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The number for the call-in day is 1.800.998.0180 and has been<br />generously provided by the National Committee to Preserve Social<br />Security and Medicare who has been a leader on this issue and whose<br />members have been making calls already.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wrote the following note to Bruce Krasting after our earlier exchange on Angry Bear.  He sent the reply below, and agreed to have it be printed here with the disclaimer that it was not originally intended for publication.  My reply to him is in comments, at his request.</p>
<p>COBERLY wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have to thank you for raising the subject of the bond market.  It was something I didn&#8217;t know about and will have to try to learn.<br />Not to be a bond trader&#8230;  just not in the genes&#8230;  but to anticipate where the other guys are coming from.  They don&#8217;t always say.<br />Heck, we had to beat it out of you.</p></blockquote>
<p>BRUCE KRASTING:</p>
<blockquote><p>I learned a fair bit in the process. I understand the scope of this better as a result. </p>
<p>I understand the attitude, &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch SS. If there is problem, fix it outside of tinkering with SS.&#8221;</p>
<p>I do think this is going to come up for discussion in the next year or so. The debate that we framed will be part of that. Tinkering with SS can potentially have beneficial impacts to the ratio of Public vs. Intergovernmental debt. This benefit could last 5-8 years depending on what is done. Right in the scope of the election cycle. So this makes the fiscal side of this a political issue. No Administration that was thinking straight would set a course that might lead to a blow up in the debtmarket. </p>
<p>The numbers are so large. Others will see the shift of this ratio as a negative as I do. There is just so much public sector borrowing that can be accomplished. There is a broad awareness of this by those who think 2-5 years out. I am sure that Larry Summers, Bernanke and others are looking at what is coming and looking for ways to stall or delay the negative impacts. (not just SS, across the board of the intergovernmental side)</p>
<p>So yes, some non SS issues (or side effects of SS) are going to become factors in evaluating this. Steve Goss would be remiss if he did not make this case privately. He understands SS&#8217;s important role in the intergovernmental picture. It is his &#8216;wild card&#8217;.</p>
<p>The best argument against this is yours. Fix the problem outside of SS. I have come to understand that this is intellectually correct. But I do not think that it will be the basis of the choices that I believe will be implemented over the next few years. What would you do if you were the Boss? Tinker with SS or increase income taxes? I know what you would do, but you are not the boss. The folks who run the show would do anything that they can do, short of raising income taxes.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Slowly moving back into everything, and so catching up with Mark Thoma&#8217;s use of Paul Volcker as his latest line of Defense of Giving the Fed More Regulatory Power. (Amusing in itself, given Volcker&#8217;s description of the Fed <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/03/18/volcker-feds-extreme-intervention-raises-some-real-questions/">before he was Owned by the Obama Administration</a>.)</p>
<p>I like Thoma (a lot more than he likes me) and his professional work is clean and clear.  (Judging by his videos, he&#8217;s also the second best college-level Econometrics teacher I&#8217;ve ever seen—and it&#8217;s no crime to be behind <a href="http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~econnwk/ploeb/pl_vitae.html">Peter Loeb</a> in that regard.)</p>
<p>But he&#8217;s an Incurable Optimist, especially in his blogging.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/01/should-the-fed-have-a-large-role-in-bank-regulation.html">For instance</a>:<br />
<blockquote> If we ask tough questions and insist that the Fed take action in response to the problems that are uncovered, oversight can be improved without moving the authority outside of the Fed. </p></blockquote>
<p>The English translation of that is: Better the Devil We Know Has Already Failed and that <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/rolfe-winkler/2010/01/18/does-volcker-give-the-fed-too-much-credit/">doesn&#8217;t have—or appear to want—the Governance Skills to Do the Job Required</a>.</p>

<p>Taxes and Business Creation</p>
<p>When you cut taxes, it leads to the creation of new businesses. By cutting taxes, people keep more of their hard earned money which gives them the resources to start new businesses. The cut in taxes also encourages people to take more risk knowing the fruit of their efforts is not going to be seized by the government and used on homeless orphans or other loafers. And its not all about folks getting off the couch and entering the business world &#8211; a low tax regime encourages those who are already in business to expand. Conversely, as we have been reminded ad nauseum as of late, rising taxes provide a disincentive to the producing class, whereupon their full-time occupation becomes going Galt (with occasional breaks to join together in large groups for some good old-fashioned collective Tea Bagging). </p>
<p>Of particular importance are cuts in marginal tax rates; potential entrepreneurs make their decisions at the margin. </p>
<p>This is all pretty basic stuff &#8211; you&#8217;ll find it in textbooks. But does the real world match up with the pretty theory? We&#8217;ll never know unless we find some data. So I got me some primo data. And as they say about data, flaunt it if you got it.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Up first is this cute sample from <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab12e.xls">the IRS</a>, which gives us the number of corporations, partnerships, and non-farm proprietorships filing taxes from 1990 to 2006. We can augment that by summing all those figures to get a &#8220;total business filings&#8221; figure. I figure the lower-taxes-leads-to-company-formation story allows us to break the 1990 to 2006 period into the following groupings:</p>
<p>1. Bush Sr. era (through 92)<br />2. Clinton era of tax hikes (through 96)<br />3. Clinton period including and following the cut in capital gains taxes (through 00)<br />4. Bush era or tax cuts (through 03)<br />5. Bush era once all the tax cuts have kicked in. (through 06)</p>
<p>Presumably, when it comes to the number of businesses, growth should be slower in Clinton&#8217;s tax hike era than in the Bush Sr. era before it &#8211; after all, taxes were higher. There should be much faster increases once the capital gains tax cut kicked in &#8211; it had both lower taxes plus faster economic growth, after all. 01 to 03 should see faster increases still as taxes came down further, but only slightly faster since the economy sucked at the time. However, from 03 to 06 we should see monster growth in business formation; taxes were lowest of all (following the cap gains tax cuts in 07 and the 01 to 03 cuts in marginal personal income taxes), plus those were the best years of the Bush Jr. era. </p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what it all looks like: </p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/S1L7uMWDWaI/AAAAAAAAAsc/59FVyzldzmY/s1600-h/taxes_and_company_formation_graph_1%5B1%5D.bmp" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" ps="true" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/S1L7uMWDWaI/AAAAAAAAAsc/59FVyzldzmY/s320/taxes_and_company_formation_graph_1%5B1%5D.bmp"></a></div>
<p>Well, this is disappointing. This graph really does not seem to conform to verses three through seventeen of Chapter One of the Gospel of St. Ronnie. The closest we get (and frankly, its not very close) to a pattern compatible with Revealed Truth is with partnerships, but there are a lot fewer partnerships than corporations or sole proprietorships. (e.g., in 06 there were 5.8 million corporations, 2.9 million partnerships, and 22 million sole proprieterships). </p>
<p>OK. So maybe this data sucks. The number of companies may not mean anything &#8211; many of these may simply be, er, vehicles for reducing one&#8217;s tax burden. So maybe we have to go elsewhere to get the kind of results that all the good people in the Robert-Mundell-to-Glenn-Beck spectrum would recognize. </p>
<p>And maybe we have to look at other things, like job creation, or the size of payrolls.</p>
<p>I pulled stuff like that from this <a href="http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/us88_06.pdf">SBA doc</a> which in turn gets its data from the Census. The data goes back to 1988, but the breakdown of periods is essentially the same, except that now we can look a the change over the entire Bush Sr. era.</p>
<p>This time we can look at the change in the number of firms, the number of establishments (a company can set up multiple establishments &#8211; think of a restaurant chain opening up another location), number of employees a these firms, and payroll. (I adjusted the payroll figures for inflation using the <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI</a>. </p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what that looks like:</p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/S1L7bXzjlyI/AAAAAAAAAsU/CUOjOLwpQSU/s1600-h/taxes_and_company_formation_graph_2%5B1%5D.bmp" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" ps="true" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/S1L7bXzjlyI/AAAAAAAAAsU/CUOjOLwpQSU/s320/taxes_and_company_formation_graph_2%5B1%5D.bmp"></a></div>
<p>Well, this isn&#8217;t cutting it either. The best period for firm formation is following Clinton&#8217;s tax hikes. The period with the fastest increases in employment and firm payrolls come after the cap gains tax cuts, but before the Bush tax cuts&#8230; and the second best period employment and payroll-wise comes after Clinton&#8217;s tax hikes. Clearly the data has to get with the program if its going to pass theoretical muster with the Chicago school or at the U of Minnesota, much less at Cato or with Sarah Palin. And let&#8217;s not even get started with the Austrians&#8230;</p>
<p>But the results might go a long way toward explaining <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/12/economic-growth-blood-suckers-v-free.html">this</a>.</p>

                                <p>The flak started quickly. Rusty suggested taking Red Cross training and being part of the solution—the very solution that can&#8217;t reach the country.  kharris compared me (un?)favorably to The Drudge Report for saying (after Robert Gates did) that the delivery obstruction was &#8220;deliberate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is the evidence keeps mounting—and it&#8217;s all on my side. <a href="http://www.buenosairesherald.com/BreakingNews/View/22873">Exhibit One</a>:<br />
<blockquote>US forces last week turned back a French aid plane carrying a field hospital from the damaged, congested airport in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, prompting a complaint from French Cooperation Minister Alain Joyandet. The plane landed safely the following day.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/us/19refugee.html?ref=americas&#038;pagewanted=print">Exhibit Two</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The State Department has also been denying many seriously injured people in Port-au-Prince visas to be transferred to Miami for surgery and treatment, said Dr. William O’Neill, the dean of the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami, which has erected a field hospital near the airport there.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s beyond insane,&#8221; Dr. O’Neill said Saturday, having just returned to Miami from Haiti. &#8220;It’s bureaucracy at its worse.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/world/americas/19aid.html?ref=americas&#038;pagewanted=print">Exhibit Three</a> (wrong people doing distribution):<br />
<blockquote>When the aid helicopters descend on the Pétionville Club golf course, once a playground for the wealthy and now a sprawling city of makeshift tents, the residents hurry toward them. But to get there, they must climb a steep embankment to a landing zone on top of a hill where the 82nd Airborne Division distributes the food and water&#8230;.</p>
<p>The elderly get priority, but some of them cannot make it up. Families with young children also have priority, so some people are said to have borrowed babies and hauled them up the hill&#8230;.</p>
<p>Since members of the 82nd Airborne, from Fort Bragg, N.C., began distributing food on Saturday, their delivery method has evolved.</p>
<p>On the first day they wore rifles slung around their backs. By Monday, they had ditched the rifles and were trying to present themselves more as aid workers than as soldiers. [emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the job usually done by the Red Cross (or that was done the first few days in New Orleans by the SCA, who had the advantage of knowing how to move a large amount of supplies through mud and floods), and who know the issues involved in distribution.  This is the job those $10 contributions by texting are supposed to be supporting.</p>
<p>This is the job that isn&#8217;t being done for nonexistent &#8220;security&#8221; issues.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>There is a light snow at the moment.  While the snow and icy roads are cleared here from yesterday, we shall see what kind of weather unfolds throughout the day.</p>
<p>The phone has been ringing steadily over the week end and Monday, with volunteer or robo calls from both senate candidates Martha Coakley and Scott Brown.  Sometimes the political ads during the day ran consecutively from different funding sources. The ceremonies for Martin Luther King took a backstage on this holiday. </p>
<p>There appears to be a lot of attempts at figuring out what is going on concerning the meteoric rise in the polls of Mr. Brown.  I assume most readers have a bit of background on this race, so I will not offer that here.  Of course, without the super-majority bar being pushed and accepted in the US Senate and a contentiously fought health insurance bill, this race would have less national coverage.</p>
<p>One needs to remember Massachusetts (is that spelled correctly? I spell it MA) has an electoral mind of its own.  It has 51% registered independents out of the pool of registered voters.  Even though there are three times the number of registered Democrats than registered Republicans (roughly 36% to 12%) we have had a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Republican govenor</a> for 16 years since William Weld took the position in 1991.</p>
<p>The state legislative bodies are overwhelmingly Democratic. </p>
<p>The 1972 national election saw MA being the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&#038;year=1972">only state going for George McGovern</a>, DC not being a state. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&#038;year=1980">1980 national election</a> had MA split the vote 41.90% Reagan to 41.75% Carter, over 15% going to the Independent.</p>
<p>Whether this special election is a bellwether for a national trend or just a reflection of MA voter quirkiness and bad timing for any election to reflect a trend in overall voter sentiment (low turnout might make it more of a comment on political machine effectiveness and preparedness) is not something I feel comfortable expounding on from a knowlegeable perspective.  </p>
<p>I am going out to vote, and await results and implications.  So this is a topical thread I believe.</p>
<p>Update:  <a target="_ blank" href="http://www.truthout.org/massachusetts-election-live-blog56173">Heavy turnout at the polls</a></p>
<p>Update 2:  Martha Coakley concedes 9:24 tonight.</p>
