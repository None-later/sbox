                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I woke up this morning to the 231st birthday of our nation and decided not to blog given the stain on this birthday from George W. Bush’s commutation of Scooter Libby.  Then I learned about what <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2007/07/04/Worldandnation/Bush_s_reprieve_for_L.shtml">Gus Bilirakis</a> had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>So far, however, only one congressional Republican from Florida, Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Palm Harbor, has publicly broken with party leaders and the president, saying Bush&#8217;s decision was wrong. Most of the others have just kept mum.&#8221; Mr. Libby was tried by a jury of his peers and was convicted of a felony,&#8221; Bilirakis said in a statement. &#8220;The fact that Mr. Libby committed this crime while serving as a public official makes it all the more egregious. Excessive or not, Mr. Libby&#8217;s sentence should be respected.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Good for Congressman Bilirakis!  </p>
<p>Let me take this opportunity to blast the press for repeating the following line ad nauseam (see for example <a href="http://www.charlottesvillenewsplex.tv/news/headlines/8303387.html">here</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush was under pressure from conservatives to pardon Lewis &#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby</p></blockquote>
<p>I have two problems with this oft repeated line: (1) it insults real conservatives; and (2) it confuses causes and effect.  On the first- there is a big difference between being a conservative and being a rightwing water carrier for this Machiavellian Administration. OK, most of these water carriers pretend they are conservatives.  But when I think of what a conservative would do in such situations, I think of the time when Senator Goldwater approached Richard Nixon and told it was time to resign from being President.  Congressman Bilirakis took a baby step in this direction but he’s no Goldwater.  And the fact that the rest of the GOP members of Congress have gone silent shows we have no Goldwaters today.  And don’t get me started on Mitt Romney or Fred Thompson who seem to think the outing of a CIA agent is in the finest of American traditions.  </p>
<p>But to suggest that these rightwing water carriers pressured Bush forgets who is giving the marching orders.  This Administration intended to do anything to cover-up its outing of a CIA agent.  And we heard the parade of lies from the likes of the water carriers over at the National Review from the git-go.  You recall: (1) there was no underlying crime; (2) Plame wasn’t a NOC; (3) it was all Richard Armitage’s fault: (3) Ms. Plame is a liberal Democrat; (4) Joe Wilson somehow lied.  We are still hearing the same old crap today.  It’s like Karl Rove wound up these talking puppets four years ago – and now that they have gotten out of control, he doesn’t know how to turn them off.  </p>
<p>No – the National Review and its ilk did not pressure Bush to do anything.  He had this in mind from day one of this scandal.  The job of the National Review has never been to advocate policy.   Rather its job is to act as Bush cheerleaders floating the trial balloons and setting the stage for the corrupt behavior of this Machiavellian Presidency.  Now one might ask why a group of conservatives would assist a Machiavellian Presidency.  But that’s a stupid question as the right wing water carriers of the National Review are not conservatives. </p>
<p>Do we have any hope as a nation returning to what our Founding Fathers envisioned.  I don’t know.  But if the GOP can shed its current corrupt leadership in favor of the likes of Gus Bilirakis – we may have a chance.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Fourth of July!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Did I say something about Mitt Romney?  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19586943">AP</a> says more:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who as Massachusetts governor refused to pardon an Iraq war veteran&#8217;s BB-gun conviction, on Tuesday called President Bush&#8217;s commutation of Scooter Libby&#8217;s prison sentence &#8220;reasonable.&#8221; &#8230; The prosecutor in the case &#8220;went after somebody even when he knew no crime had been committed,&#8221; Romney said. &#8220;Given that fact, isn&#8217;t it reasonable for a commutation of a portion of the sentence to be made?&#8221; &#8230; In his presidential bid, Romney often proudly points out that he was the first governor in modern Massachusetts history to deny every request for a pardon or commutation during his four years in office. He says he refused pardons because he didn&#8217;t want to overturn a jury. During the four years Romney was in office, 100 requests for commutations and 172 requests for pardons were filed in the state. All were denied.</p></blockquote>
<p>Romney is not only a hypocrite but also one who seems to think the outing of a CIA is AOK (“no crime had been committed”).</p>

                                <p>On June 15th an F-16 crashed north of Baghdad.</p>
<p>I remember thinking that another family would be in mourning.</p>
<p>My mother called me two days later – the pilot was a resident of the small village where I was born and raised. His family farm is about two miles from our former family homestead.</p>
<p>Kevin was 13 younger than me, so I didn’t know him, but I knew his parents (not well) and his extended family. He was a Delta Airlines pilot, a Lt. Colonel in the Ohio Air Guard, and he always made time in the spring and fall for planting and harvest on the family farm.</p>
<p>The little village has had other tragedies over the years, and has always pulled together and recovered. During WW II the little village of 350 people lost 7 men KIA, which seems horrific to me, and I hear it was.</p>
<p>The churches and the American Legion Post are the bedrock of the community, and those groups will help the community stay upright and move on. The Legion has been a major force in the community since the post WW II years.</p>
<p>Seven times in the last decade I have stood in various small town cemeteries, tried not to flinch at the rifle volleys and failed to stay dry-eyed during Taps. Those ceremonies though were different, the veterans were carried to their rest by their grandchildren and great-grandchildren after long and full lives.</p>
<p>This is not the day to rant about the war, whether it is right or wrong, but a day to wonder at the courage of those few who stand watch over all of us, without question, and then to feel a bit of the sadness of the families and friends.</p>

                                <p>Presented without comment, the unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature&#8217;s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
<p>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</p>
<p>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>
<p>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</p>
<p>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>
<p>He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</p>
<p>He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</p>
<p>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</p>
<p>He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.</p>
<p>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p>
<p>He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.</p>
<p>He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.</p>
<p>He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.</p>
<p>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:</p>
<p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>
<p>For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:</p>
<p>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</p>
<p>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:</p>
<p>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:</p>
<p>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:</p>
<p>For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies</p>
<p>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:</p>
<p>For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p>
<p>He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.</p>
<p>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p>
<p>He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &#038; Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</p>
<p>He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.</p>
<p>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</p>
<p>In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>
<p>Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</p>
<p>We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. — And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The LA Times has a story on the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-na-private4jul04,0,5808980.story?coll=la-home-center">outsourcing of the Iraq War</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The number of U.S.-paid private contractors in Iraq now exceeds that of American combat troops, newly released figures show, raising fresh questions about the privatization of the war effort and the government&#8217;s capacity to carry out military and rebuilding campaigns.</p>
<p>More than 180,000 civilians — including Americans, foreigners and Iraqis — are working in Iraq under U.S. contracts, according to State and Defense department figures obtained by the Los Angeles Times. </p>
<p>Including the recent troop buildup, 160,000 soldiers and a few thousand civilian government employees are stationed in Iraq.</p>
<p>The total number of private contractors, far higher than previously reported, shows how heavily the Bush administration has relied on corporations to carry out the occupation of Iraq — a mission criticized as being undermanned.</p>
<p>&#8220;These numbers are big,&#8221; said Peter Singer, a Brookings Institution scholar who has written on military contracting. &#8220;They illustrate better than anything that we went in without enough troops. This is not the coalition of the willing. It&#8217;s the coalition of the billing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The numbers include at least 21,000 Americans, 43,000 foreign contractors and about 118,000 Iraqis — all employed in Iraq by U.S. tax dollars, according to the most recent government data.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m actually quite OK with the idea of hiring Iraqis&#8230; they&#8217;re there and pretty inexpensive.</p>
<p>However&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>But there are also signs that even those mounting numbers may not capture the full picture. Private security contractors, who are hired to protect government officials and buildings, were not fully counted in the survey, according to industry and government officials.</p>
<p>Continuing uncertainty over the numbers of armed contractors drew special criticism from military experts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have control of all the coalition guns in Iraq. That&#8217;s dangerous for our country,&#8221; said William Nash, a retired Army general and reconstruction expert. The Pentagon &#8220;is hiring guns. You can rationalize it all you want, but that&#8217;s obscene.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The article continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>But critics worry that troops and their missions could be jeopardized if contractors, functioning outside the military&#8217;s command and control, refuse to make deliveries of vital supplies under fire. </p>
<p>At one point in 2004, for example, U.S. forces were put on food rations when drivers balked at taking supplies into a combat zone.</p>
<p>Adding an element of potential confusion, no single agency keeps track of the number or location of contractors.</p>
<p>In response to demands from Congress, the U.S. Central Command began a census last year of the number of contractors working on U.S. and Iraqi bases to determine how much food, water and shelter was needed.</p>
<p>That census, provided to The Times under the Freedom of Information Act, shows about 130,000 contractors and subcontractors of different nationalities working at U.S. and Iraqi military bases.</p>
<p>However, U.S. military officials acknowledged that the census did not include other government agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department.</p></blockquote>
<p>Excuse me?  The number doesn&#8217;t include the State Department?  </p>
<p>And how about the contractors?  How many sub-contractors do they have?</p>
<blockquote><p>The companies with the largest number of employees are foreign firms in the Middle East that subcontract to KBR, the Houston-based oil services company, according to the Central Command database. KBR, once a subsidiary of Halliburton Co., provides logistics support to troops, the single largest contract in Iraq.</p>
<p>Middle Eastern companies, including Kulak Construction Co. of Turkey and Projects International of Dubai, supply labor from Third World countries to KBR and other U.S. companies for menial work on U.S. bases and rebuilding projects. Foreigners are used instead of Iraqis because of fears that insurgents could infiltrate projects.</p></blockquote>
<p>What about the Blackwater types?</p>
<blockquote><p>The most controversial contractors are those working for private security companies, including Blackwater, Triple Canopy and Erinys. They guard sensitive sites and provide protection to U.S. and Iraqi government officials and businessmen.</p>
<p>Security contractors draw some of the sharpest criticism, much of it from military policy experts who say their jobs should be done by the military. On several occasions, heavily armed private contractors have engaged in firefights when attacked by Iraqi insurgents.</p>
<p>Others worry that the private security contractors lack accountability. Although scores of troops have been prosecuted for serious crimes, only a handful of private security contractors have faced legal charges.</p>
<p>The number of private security contractors in Iraq remains unclear, despite Central Command&#8217;s latest census. The Times identified 21 security companies in the Central Command database, deploying 10,800 men. </p>
<p>However, the Defense Department&#8217;s Motsek, who monitors contractors, said the Pentagon estimated the total was 6,000.</p>
<p>Both figures are far below the private security industry&#8217;s own estimate of about 30,000 private security contractors working for government agencies, nonprofit organizations, media outlets and businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given how much outright disinformation we&#8217;ve been provided about this war so far, my bet is that even these FOIA numbers are waaay understated, even taking into account that they don&#8217;t include State Dep&#8217;t figures.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2007/jul/02/predicting_with_a_handicap_why_are_economists_predictions_so_often_wrong">Jared Bernstein</a> did say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economists sometimes serve vested interests, and will change their views accordingly. The best example is also one of the best economists, Greg Mankiw. This textbook-writing Harvard prof was Bush’s chief economist for awhile, and during his confirmation hearing and subsequent tenure at the White House, he constantly defended Bushonomics, including supply-side beliefs that he once argued were the musings of “cranks and charlatans.&#8221; Now, Mankiw may well have felt he could do the nation more good if he were working from the inside, trying to nudge the administration’s economic policy in a better direction (if so, he failed). But if we’re going to argue in support of ideas on Monday that we correctly dismissed as nutty last Friday, we’re unlikely to be either correct or credible.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/07/on-charlatons-and-cranks.html">Greg Mankiw</a> objects:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jared Bernstein, a bigshot at the left-wing thinktank Economic Policy Institute, seems to think I am a hypocrite.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Now we’re getting personal</em>.  But there is a problem with what Greg said as <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/003161.html">Max Sawicky</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the question is whether Mankiw&#8217;s performance at the CEA was faithful to his academic militance. For that one would have to dredge up CEA statements that conflict with textbook and other academic statements. In his book, NGM is forthright that the giant revenue response from a tax cut is hokum. In his testimony, he is less emphatic, or as he puts it, &#8220;skeptical&#8221; of such claims. Moreover, he asserted that the Bush Administration did not adhere to the &#8220;extreme&#8221; view</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s sort of like saying this White House never claimed Saddam and Osama were linked.  Max also reminds us of what <a href="http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2007/03/mccain_and_mank.html">Brendan Nyhan</a> said when Mankiw went after McCain’s conversion to free lunch supply-side-ism:</p>
<blockquote><p>But what Mankiw doesn&#8217;t mention is President Bush and Vice President Cheney&#8217;s expressed &#8220;fealty to the most extreme supply-side views,&#8221; which Mankiw conspicuously failed to change during his tenure as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2003 to 2005. Indeed, during his Senate confirmation hearing, Mankiw was asked about claims that tax cuts were self-financing, and he disavowed them, saying &#8220;I remain skeptical of those claims.&#8221; However, he also stated that he thought the administration had not made such claims, which was &#8211; and is &#8211; false</p></blockquote>
<p>Brendan also asks whether Mankiw will keep Mitt Romney from making free lunch claims.  So far – it is an open question.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/max-sawicky-on-.html">Brad DeLong</a> has more.</p>

<blockquote><p>On June 9, 2003, just one day after his national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice, got beaten up on the Sunday shows for claiming no one in the administration knew that the Niger intelligence was bunk, George Bush expressed concern about the allegations. Scooter Libby passed on that concern to vice president Cheney. Bush&#8217;s concern set off a chain of events that ended up in the outing of a CIA spy, Valerie Plame, and the indictment and conviction of Scooter Libby &#8230; the real effect of Bush&#8217;s actions is to prevent Libby from revealing the truth about Bush&#8217;s &#8211; and vice president Cheney&#8217;s &#8211; own actions in the leak. By commuting Libby&#8217;s sentence, Bush protected himself and his vice president from potential criminal exposure for their actions in the CIA Leak. As such, Libby&#8217;s commutation is nothing short of another obstruction of justice.  Cheney&#8217;s involvement in the CIA leak case is central. He personally undertook research on Joe Wilson and his trip; while doing that research, Cheney learned that Wilson&#8217;s wife worked in the counter-proliferation division of the CIA, the part of the clandestine services that fights the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Cheney then passed on the news of Plame&#8217;s CIA identity to Libby. When, on July 6, 2003, Joe Wilson publicly accused the administration of fixing the case for war in an op-ed in the New York Times. Cheney cut out the op-ed and wrote his notes on it. &#8220;Have they done this sort of thing? Send an ambassador to answer a question? Do we ordinarily send people out pro bono to work for us?&#8221; After writing those questions about the circumstances of the trip, he wrote one more question, making an accusation that would show up later in leaks to journalists. &#8220;Or did his wife send him on a junket?&#8221; When Joe Wilson criticised the administration publicly, Cheney&#8217;s response was to insinuate that Wilson&#8217;s wife &#8211; whom Cheney knew worked in the clandestine side of the CIA &#8211; was somehow doing something improper.  The next day or the day after, Cheney ordered Scooter Libby to leak something to the New York Times&#8217; Judith Miller. Libby hesitated. He couldn&#8217;t leak it, Libby said, because it was classified. But Cheney reassured Libby that President Bush had unilaterally declassified the material. Libby was still worried, so he asked Cheney&#8217;s counsel, David Addington, whether the president could just unilaterally declassify something. When Addington assured him that the president could, Libby seemed satisfied.  Shortly thereafter, Scooter Libby leaked to Miller Valerie Plame&#8217;s identity and the contents of the CIA report on Wilson&#8217;s trip to Niger. Libby would later say that Cheney had declassified the NIE, and not Plame&#8217;s identity or the trip report. But there&#8217;s no paperwork to support this claim, just the word of a convicted perjurer. Furthermore, Libby testified that Cheney had ordered him to leak this material exclusively &#8211; and Libby had already leaked the NIE to two other reporters. The two pieces of information that Libby leaked to Miller exclusively, after Cheney ordered Libby to leak information to her, were Plame&#8217;s identity and the CIA report on Wilson&#8217;s trip. The following Monday, July 14, when a Robert Novak article published Plame&#8217;s covert identity, Cheney and Libby already knew it would appear. The first thing they did that morning was ask their CIA briefer if he had read it &#8211; they told him that it was not his problem. As if they already knew it was somebody&#8217;s problem.  Later that fall, as the scandal erupted, Libby asked Cheney to ensure that the White House spokesperson publicly exonerated him, as he had earlier done for Karl Rove. To make sure this happened, the Vice President started to write a note, &#8220;Not going to protect one staffer [meaning Rove] and sacrifice the guy the President&#8230;&#8221; But then Cheney stopped. He crossed out the first four letters of the word, &#8220;President&#8221; and finished the sentence: &#8220;&#8230;that was asked to stick his neck in the meat grinder because of the incompetence of others.&#8221; He came close to writing that President Bush had asked Libby to take the lead on responding to Wilson. And then, according to some trial testimony, he got Bush to make sure Libby got his public exoneration, a public claim that Libby had nothing to do with the leak of Plame&#8217;s identity. Then, finally, before Scooter Libby told the FBI his now-discredited story about learning Plame&#8217;s identity anew from Tim Russert, Libby went and told the vice president what he was going to tell them. The only person, apparently, that Libby shared his lies with was the one guy &#8211; the vice president &#8211; who knew they weren&#8217;t true.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did Dick Cheney start a chain of events that led to the Novak column?  Of course he did.  That was the plan.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/marcy-wheeler-o.html">Brad DeLong</a> also understands PlameGate:</p>
<blockquote><p>The balance of the probabilities is that Scooter Libby perjured himself and obstructed justice because he knew things about Cheney that were deeply embarrassing and discrediting, and because he believed that Patrick Fitzgerald was a special prosector like Kenneth Starr &#8211; one who believed that the core of his job was to leak as many grand jury secrets as he could as long as they were discreditable to the president&#8217;s party. Thus Libby thought that perjury was the better part of valor given that he needed to protect his boss from the discreditable and embarrassing possibility that people would learn how he behaved.  There is also the possibility that Scooter Libby perjured himself because for him to testify truthfully would have led to the impeachment and removal from office of Cheney and Bush. Now we will never know which.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, I think we do.  Had the truth come out before November 2004, John Kerry would be President today and this talk about impeachment would be moot.  Which is why the White House slow rolled this investigation.  Had Libby told the truth sometime after the November 2004 elections, we would be having impeachment hearings if not a Senate trial by now.  But it seems actual impeachment occurs only for partisan reasons as the impeachment of Andrew Johnson by the radical Republicans in 1868 or the impeachment of Bill Clinton by the corrupt Republicans in 1998.  Nixon’s corrupt behavior deserved impeachment, which never occurred.  But that’s because Nixon resigned in August 1974 when principled conservatives like Senator Goldwater called on him to resign.  Bush and Cheney are much more corrupt than Nixon ever was.  So where are the principled conservatives today?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2007/07/03/BL2007070301366.html">Dan Froomkin</a> also understands PlameGate:</p>
<blockquote><p>All of this means that Bush&#8217;s decision yesterday to commute Libby&#8217;s prison sentence isn&#8217;t just a matter of unequal justice. It is also a potentially self-serving and corrupt act.  Was there a quid pro quo at work? Was Libby being repaid for falling on his sword and protecting his bosses from further scrutiny? Alternately, was he being repaid for his defense team&#8217;s abrupt decision in mid-trial not to drag Cheney into court, where he would have faced cross-examination by Fitzgerald? &#8230; Bush&#8217;s written statement announcing clemency was a clear attempt to suggest that he was splitting the difference between those who supported and opposed a pardon for Libby. But in fact, Bush&#8217;s order grants Libby everything he needs in the short run while still keeping open the possibility of a pardon in the long run, as Bush heads out the door. And to law-and-order types, Bush&#8217;s message may actually be more galling. For Bush to state he believed Libby to be innocent would at least have been defensible. Instead, what Bush is saying is that acknowledges the guilty verdict &#8211; but, when it comes to his friends and colleagues, he just doesn&#8217;t care what the justice system concluded was a fitting punishment.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is clear – yesterday’s commutation was a continuation of the cover-up.  CNN just played Mitt Romney excusing this act by saying Bill Clinton issued pardons too.  Not only is Mitt Romney playing the childish game exhibited by Bush apologist buffpilot (see comments to my posts on this), he is missing the whole point about this cover-up.  Or does Mr. Romney think GOP cover-ups are simply patriotism?</p>

The issue involved the following hypothetical:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the [Constitutional] convention George Mason argued that the President might use his pardoning power to &#8220;pardon crimes which were advised by himself&#8221; or, before indictment or conviction, &#8220;to stop inquiry and prevent detection.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>James Madison noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]f the President be connected, in any suspicious manner, with any person, and there be grounds tp believe he will shelter him, the House of Representatives can impeach him; they can remove him if found guilty</p></blockquote>
<p>J. Elliot noted this in The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 74.  Elliot further noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>the President could be suspended when suspected, and his powers would devolve on the Vice President, who could likewise be suspended until impeached and convicted, if he were also suspected.</p></blockquote>
<p>James Madison’s wisdom certainly applies today.</p>

                                <p>This post looks at the male population 18 – 24 and the homicide rate. Not long ago, I had a post on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-murder.html">homicide rate</a>, and I noted that the murder rate declined fastest under Clinton among all Presidents. Naturally, that means something else is at play (just as it was with other series, such as the abortion rate, real GDP per capita, paying off the debt, etc.), because we all know Clinton can’t possibly be given credit for something that went well during his administrations. Two culprits emerged… either it was the states with their 3 strikes laws, or demographics just happened to favor Clinton. (Note… the post also showed a positive correlation between the stock price of Sturm, Ruger as a share of the S&#038;P 500 and the subsequent’s year murder rate. Sturm, Ruger was chosen because unlike other publicly traded gun manufacturers, guns are its primary line of business, and it sells mostly to civilians in the domestic market.) </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have a comment about 3 strikes laws at the end of this post. But I now have some cleaned up Census demographics data. Data from 1980 to 2005 comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0011.xls">here</a>, and reader I. Kitov pointed me to data going back further <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/pre-1980/PE-11.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>OK. So here’s what the male 18 – 24 population, them folks most likely to commit murder and mayhem, looks like…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Roo-Mjb6N8I/AAAAAAAAAXg/Anh-o3OVZk8/s1600-h/Males+18+-+24+Graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Roo-Mjb6N8I/AAAAAAAAAXg/Anh-o3OVZk8/s320/Males+18+-+24+Graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here’s a summary…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Roo3ijb6N4I/AAAAAAAAAXA/IrNbs0JyN1E/s1600-h/Males+18+-+24+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Roo3ijb6N4I/AAAAAAAAAXA/IrNbs0JyN1E/s320/Males+18+-+24+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Well… it doesn’t appear that the big drop in the homicide rate under Clinton is due to demographics. Ike, Reagan, and GHW all had much more favorable demographics, but of those, only Reagan showed a decline in the murder rate, and much, much lower than under Clinton.</p>
<p>Here’s the murder rate per 100,000 and the males 18 – 24 per 100 people. </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Roo3rDb6N5I/AAAAAAAAAXI/ddSmHK3XeDU/s1600-h/Males+18+-+24+Graph+2.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Roo3rDb6N5I/AAAAAAAAAXI/ddSmHK3XeDU/s320/Males+18+-+24+Graph+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what conclusion I can reach from this, but concluding that the decline in the murder rate under Clinton was due to demographics seems a stretch. </p>
<p>Which leads to one final excuse&#8230; does anyone know where I can find a list of all the states that enacted three strikes laws and in what year. Here&#8217;s my reasoning&#8230; presumably, if those laws are the reason for this, as reader Sebastian Holsclaw insists, the murder rate in each state will decline beginning with the passage of the law. Meanwhile, states without those laws shouldn&#8217;t show much or any decline in the murder rate.</p>
<p>Offhand, I only about three states&#8230; Washington passed the first 3 strikes law in 1993, CA in 1994, and NY didn&#8217;t pass one at all. Here&#8217;s the problem&#8230; <a href="http://bjsdata.ojp.usdoj.gov/dataonline/Search/Homicide/State/StatebyState.cfm">Bureau of Justice Statistics State Homicide figures</a> show that for CA, the number of homicides in the state did in fact peak in 1993, which would be consistent with the notion of 3 strikes having an impact. Sadly, it bottomed out in 1999, without any repeal of the law. </p>
<p>NY&#8230; the peak occurred in 1990, and one heck of a decline (number of murders dropped from 2605 in 1990 to 889 in 2004 &#8211; far more impressive than the decline in CA) after that&#8230; without any 3 strikes law. In Washington, murders peaked in 1994&#8230; after the 3 strikes law was already in place. So&#8230; the 3 strikes story is plausible for CA, a stretch but possible for WA, and not useful for explaining the really big drop in murders. </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>I’ll see if there’s any more information I can extract from demographic info soon.</p>

<blockquote><p>President Bush has commuted the prison term of former White House aide I. Lewis &#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby, facing 30 months in prison after a federal court convicted him of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators.  Earlier Monday, a federal appeals court unanimously ruled that Libby could not delay his sentence. The charges relate to the 2003 leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame&#8217;s identity.  Libby was only weeks away from surrendering to a prison.  Bush was under great pressure by Libby allies to pardon the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. In a written statement issued hours after that ruling, Bush called the sentence &#8220;excessive.&#8221; But he also rejected calls for a pardon for Libby. &#8220;The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer, public servant, and private citizen will be long-lasting,&#8221; Bush said. But he said Libby was given &#8220;a harsh sentence based in part on allegations never presented to the jury.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The President dusts off the rightwing talking points.  Pathetic.  But in one way the sentence was “excessive”.  Having the prospect of serving a 30 month jail sentence, the pressure for Mr. Libby to rat out Dick Cheney and George W. Bush might have become too much for him to bear.  </p>
<p>The good folks at <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/003579.php">TPMmuckraker</a> have the President’s incredibly dishonest statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit today rejected Lewis Libby’s request to remain free on bail while pursuing his appeals for the serious convictions of perjury and obstruction of justice. As a result, Mr. Libby will be required to turn himself over to the Bureau of Prisons to begin serving his prison sentence. I have said throughout this process that it would not be appropriate to comment or intervene in this case until Mr. Libby’s appeals have been exhausted. But with the denial of bail being upheld and incarceration imminent, I believe it is now important to react to that decision. From the very beginning of the investigation into the leaking of Valerie Plame’s name, I made it clear to the White House staff and anyone serving in my administration that I expected full cooperation with the Justice Department. Dozens of White House staff and administration officials dutifully cooperated. After the investigation was under way, the Justice Department appointed United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois Patrick Fitzgerald as a Special Counsel in charge of the case. Mr. Fitzgerald is a highly qualified, professional prosecutor who carried out his responsibilities as charged.<br />This case has generated significant commentary and debate. Critics of the investigation have argued that a special counsel should not have been appointed, nor should the investigation have been pursued after the Justice Department learned who leaked Ms. Plame’s name to columnist Robert Novak. Furthermore, the critics point out that neither Mr. Libby nor anyone else has been charged with violating the Intelligence Identities Protection Act or the Espionage Act, which were the original subjects of the investigation. Finally, critics say the punishment does not fit the crime: Mr. Libby was a first-time offender with years of exceptional public service and was handed a harsh sentence based in part on allegations never presented to the jury. Others point out that a jury of citizens weighed all the evidence and listened to all the testimony and found Mr. Libby guilty of perjury and obstructing justice. They argue, correctly, that our entire system of justice relies on people telling the truth. And if a person does not tell the truth, particularly if he serves in government and holds the public trust, he must be held accountable. They say that had Mr. Libby only told the truth, he would have never been indicted in the first place. Both critics and defenders of this investigation have made important points. I have made my own evaluation. In preparing for the decision I am announcing today, I have carefully weighed these arguments and the circumstances surrounding this case.<br />Mr. Libby was sentenced to thirty months of prison, two years of probation, and a $250,000 fine. In making the sentencing decision, the district court rejected the advice of the probation office, which recommended a lesser sentence and the consideration of factors that could have led to a sentence of home confinement or probation. I respect the jury’s verdict. But I have concluded that the prison sentence given to Mr. Libby is excessive. Therefore, I am commuting the portion of Mr. Libby’s sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison.<br />My decision to commute his prison sentence leaves in place a harsh punishment for Mr. Libby. The reputation he gained through his years of public service and professional work in the legal community is forever damaged. His wife and young children have also suffered immensely. He will remain on probation.The significant fines imposed by the judge will remain in effect. The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer, public servant, and private citizen will be long-lasting. The Constitution gives the President the power of clemency to be used when he deems it to be warranted. It is my judgment that a commutation of the prison term in Mr. Libby’s case is an appropriate exercise of this power.</p></blockquote>
<p>The line about “I made it clear to the White House staff and anyone serving in my administration that I expected full cooperation with the Justice Department. Dozens of White House staff and administration officials dutifully cooperated” is a bald faced lie. This commutation was part of the cover-up process.</p>
<p>Earlier, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/07/02/joe-wilson-libby-pardon">Faiz</a> brought us the recent words of Joseph Wilson who rightfully argued that the proponents of a Libby pardon were accessories to an ongoing crime.
