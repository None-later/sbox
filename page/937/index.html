                                <p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/11/18/iraq.blair/index.html">CNN</a> reports on Tony Blair’s interview with David Frost, which is being touted by the left side of the blogosphere as a concession that Iraq is a disaster:<br />
<blockquote>During the interview, Frost suggested that the West&#8217;s intervention in Iraq had &#8220;so far been pretty much of a disaster.&#8221;  Blair replied: &#8220;It has, but you see what I say to people is why is it difficult in Iraq? It&#8217;s not difficult because of some accident in planning, it&#8217;s difficult because there&#8217;s a deliberate strategy &#8211; al Qaeda with Sunni insurgents on one hand, Iranian-backed elements with Shia militias on the other &#8211; to create a situation in which the will of the majority for peace is displaced by the will of the minority for war.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe the Prime Minister is correct to say he called Iraq a disaster is being a little disingenuous.  After all – how could the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the President of the United States have realized that the Sunnis and Al Qaeda would exploit the power vacuum this invasion created?  So their logic goes, but any thinking person would have realized this possibility before we decided to invade.  So is Blair saying that he and George W. Bush are this incredibly stupid?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZDhmMWFhNTMwZmJhODIxYzFhNWZjMjYxZTY4OTU1Zjk=">Charles Krauthammer</a> suggests we wash our hands of the entire Iraq mess:<br />
<blockquote>We have given the Iraqis a republic and they do not appear able to keep it &#8230; Our objectives in Iraq were twofold and always simple: depose Saddam and replace his murderous regime with a self-sustaining, democratic government. The first was relatively easy. But Iraq’s first truly democratic government turned out to be hopelessly feeble and fractured, little more than a collection of ministries handed over to various parties, militias and strongmen. The problem is not, as we endlessly argue about, the number of American troops. Or of Iraqi troops. The problem is the allegiance of the Iraqi troops. Some serve the abstraction called Iraq. But many swear fealty to political parties, religious sects, or militia leaders &#8230; Such a coalition was almost created after the latest Iraqi elections. It needs to be attempted again. One can tinker with American tactics or troop levels from today until doomsday. But unless the Iraqis can put together a government of unitary purpose and resolute action, the simple objective of this war &#8211; to leave behind a self-sustaining democratic government &#8211; is not attainable.</p></blockquote>
<p>If a Democrat suggested as much, the National Review would cry “cut and run”.  But Krauthammer is saying we can’t blame Bush’s idiotic decision on 3/19/2003.  But wait just a second – shouldn’t we have anticipated all of this before we made that stupid decision.  Shorter Krauthammer – don’t blame us for our actions as we are too stupid to be held accountable for the mess we made.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A while back, I helped write position papers for a Senate candidate.  I thought the candidate would make an awful Senator (and events have since proven me right) but I only got involved after hearing the other candidate speak.  I am quite grateful that man never became a Senator.  I think most of you would be grateful too, regardless of your political leanings. </p>
<p>Hopefully, that establishes some bona fides for me when I say I&#8217;m not one of those people who reflexively think that Congress is made up of a bunch of crooks but my own representative or senator is honest.  Nevertheless, while I&#8217;m not enamored of either of my Senators (Boxer and Feinstein), I do think highly of my representative – Henry Waxman.  (Sadly…  I’m in the process of moving, and won’t have the pleasure of voting for at least one person without having to hold my nose at the same time.)  But then, I’ve thought highly of him for a long time, even before I lived in his district.</p>
<p>Perhaps its because I don’t pay enough attention to politics so, while I have seen some of his investigations, I haven’t seen his negatives.  I don’t know.  I do know the impression I have is of a guy who is a partisan Democrat, but who will call bull**** on his own side if he thinks he sees it.  I get the impression that Tom Coburn is more or less the equivalent on the other side – I may not agree with Coburn on much, but he does seem to stick to his beliefs.</p>
<p>Am I wrong about Waxman and Coburn?  Are they really honest or have I missed something?  Are there other elected or appointed people in government that are actually honest?  I’m interested in your thoughts.  (Note… this is not an open thread on dishonest politicians – I don’t think blogger has quite enough capacity to cover that.)</p>

                                <p><a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1153AP_Baucus_Finance_Agenda.html">This</a> should be interesting:<br />
<blockquote>The incoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said Thursday he wants to hold hearings on looming insolvencies in the Medicare and Social Security programs but said President Bush&#8217;s plan to partially privatize Social Security is dead. &#8220;Don&#8217;t waste our time,&#8221; said Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of Montana. &#8220;It&#8217;s off the table.&#8221; He said the rising cost of Medicare and other health costs is a priority for the committee, though he did not detail how the committee would approach those problems. He said he will hold &#8220;vigorous&#8221; hearings on the issue. Baucus said he will propose legislation to simplify the Medicare prescription drug program by streamlining the number of plans available and making it easier for people to choose one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Privatization of Social Security has died so his committee will focus on real reforms – not rightwing agendas!  And Baucus wants to make good on the Democratic proposal to make that bloated Bush prescription drug benefit more efficient or as <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_11/010249.php">Kevin Drum</a> puts it:<br />
<blockquote>Nancy Pelosi can now begin to concentrate on her legislative agenda. One of the top items on that agenda is allowing the federal government to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, a common-sense proposal that would result in lower costs for both the government and for senior citizens on Medicare.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the GOP is more interested increasing goodies for the fat cats paying for them with some magic credit card, so we are likely to hear the mantra about less R&#038;D for life saving drugs.  Kevin points us to <a href="http://www.tnr.com/user/nregi.mhtml?i=20061120&#038;s=cohn112006&#038;pt=eQ510s%2FQdQ8nc76Rht1Fbm%3D%3D">Jonathan Cohn</a> who counters with:<br />
<blockquote>The most important basic medical and scientific research that leads to major medical breakthroughs usually takes place under government auspices &#8211; typically, through grants from the National Institutes of Health. In other words, taxpayers &#8211; not drug companies &#8211; are the ones financing the most important drug research today. So, even if the pharmaceutical industry did reduce its research and development investment because of declining revenues, what we&#8217;d lose probably wouldn&#8217;t be the next cure for cancer &#8211; it would be the next treatment for seasonal allergies, and likely no better than the ones we have already.</p></blockquote>
<p>Offering patent protection is neither the only way to encourage R&#038;D nor necessarily the most economically efficient way.  But I have another problem with such monopoly rights – the incentive to do a massive amount of promotion.  Let’s take <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=MRK&#038;annual">Merck</a> as example.  Merck sales have averaged about $22.5 billion a year from 2003 to 2005 with operating profits being about 30% of sales.  Its R&#038;D budget runs about 17% of sales and the cost of producing drugs is just over 20% of sales.  Its selling and marketing expenses are running in the neighborhood of 33% of sales.  I realize that some of the upfront promotional expenses of a pharmaceutical company represent the type of detailing that helps doctors figure out which drugs to give to which patients.  But are the proponents of unchecked monopoly power really trying to tell us that we need all of this marketing activity?  </p>
<p>But if you are a member of the free lunch wing of the GOP, why would one care that the Federal government will be spending a fortune on this new entitlement?  Just give everyone another tax cut and pretend money grows on trees!</p>
<p>Speaking of the free lunch wing of the GOP, check out Alan Murray as properly criticized by <a href="http://www.danielgross.net/archives/2006/11/12-week/index.html#a001230">Daniel Gross</a>.  Alan Murray curiously writes:<br />
<blockquote>The most conspicuous example of overreach was a line inserted in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 that prohibited the U.S. government from negotiating prices directly with drug companies … Allowing the government to negotiate prices directly with drug companies has become Democratic dogma. And a few moderate Republicans are toeing the line as well. That doesn&#8217;t make it a good idea. Truth is, drug companies can&#8217;t really &#8220;negotiate&#8221; with the government, any more than a backwoods hiker can negotiate with a 900-pound grizzly bear. With a market share of about 46%, the government would set drug prices, not negotiate them, and then establish &#8220;formularies&#8221; telling seniors which drugs they could use and which ones they couldn&#8217;t. Would that make seniors feel better off? I doubt it.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a good idea to let taxpayers be subsidizing the monopoly power or Big Pharma?</p>

<p>The National Review had <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODUyYzFkNjg2M2JhM2I4OWU3NmFkMjFjOGZjNTc2M2E=">Iain Murray</a> write their tribute to the late Milton Friedman.  I’m not sure why as Mr. Murray starts by saying he never met Milton Friedman.  And then Murray goes on to blame the Thatcher (who became prime minister in 1979) recession (illustrated in our graph) on Dr. Friedman:<br />
<blockquote>The broadcast was about monetarism; more specifically, Friedman’s central insight that the Keynesian notion that there was a trade-off between inflation and unemployment was simply wrong. Instead, it was monetary policy that drove inflation; too much money chasing too few goods led to higher prices. Inflation, in turn, destroyed jobs. Following the election of Margaret Thatcher as leader of the Conservative party, she and her allies such as Sir Keith Joseph realized that a healthy dose of Friedmanite policy had to be administered to the ailing economy. In 1979, the pre-election document “The Right Approach to the Economy” declared that a Conservative government would stop messing about trying to control the economy, strictly control the money supply, and institute supply-side reforms such as reduction of government spending and lower taxation.  Of course, things didn’t work out quite as easily as that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though Mr. Murray rambles on incoherently after this last quoted statement, that things didn’t work out quite as easily as that – but neither Milton Friedman nor Edmund Phelps said disinflation was painless.  That claim was being made by their rational expectations successors (Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent, etc.) who were the guides to the Thatcher and Volcker attempts to reduce inflation quickly through tight monetary policy.  And the U.S. experiment worked no better than the UK experiment.  </p>
<p>Now I thought the folks over at the National Review actually like Uncle Miltie – so why was their tribute to him blaming Thatcher’s follies on his advice to Richard Nixon in 1969 (which of course didn’t work painlessly either).</p>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NjAyYzA5NWU5MTRmOWE1MzI1OTBlMDk1MzI3YzE3ZmQ=">John Tamny</a> says the low real GDP growth last quarter was actually good news if you are willing to turned conventional wisdom on its head:<br />
<blockquote>GDP measures the total dollar amounts of goods and services produced by people, businesses, property, and governments located in the United States. Government spending grew just 2 percent in the third quarter, and while this lower number weighed on nominal GDP gains, it’s a fallacy to assume that governments can tax the private sector and actually stimulate real growth by giving back what they’ve taken. Lower government spending, if it becomes a trend, will in the near-term subtract from GDP growth, but stimulate real growth over the long-term … Strong GDP numbers in recent years have at times been misleading (and belied by subpar stock market returns), and the apparently weak third-quarter reading was equally deceptive. Lower government spending, a rising dollar, normalized property values, and a capital surplus all drove the nominal number down &#8211; but all are bullish in terms of real economic growth.  Conventional wisdom has once again been turned on its head.</p></blockquote>
<p>If he is trying to say that less fiscal stimulus leads to more national savings and investment in the long-run, I agree.  But maybe someone should get Mr. Tamny a copy of <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory">The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</a>.  Lord Keynes noted over 70 years ago that if investment failed to increase by the increase in national savings, we would see a recession.  I’m a little surprised that Mr. Tamny did not notice that the growth in government purchases actually exceeded the growth in GDP.  And as Tamny is hopeful that investment demand might increase, how could he not notice that overall investment demand fall last quarter?  If he wants investment demand to rise – maybe he and his National Review crew should cease and desist with their FED bashing especially since they can’t make up their minds whether monetary policy is too expansionary or too tight.</p>
<p>But the real winner for having one’s head on upside down is <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTBkZDA3NTkzMzk4YTg0NjJmZmIyMmJmNDQwNjUzMDQ=">Peter Ferrara</a>: <br />
<blockquote>The height of the Reagan economic recovery occurred in 1986. And what a recovery it was &#8230; And by 1981, every major economic indicator was headed in the wrong direction. In the 1982–1983 period, however, every major indicator quite literally turned around.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shall we introduce Mr. Ferrara to the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">NIPA tables</a> from BEA?  Real GDP growth during 1980QIV and 1981QI was 8% on an annualized basis.  The overall growth rate for 1981 was 2.5% but we did slip into a recession in the latter part of 1981.  Mr. Ferrara seems to also not realize that real GDP fell by 1.9% during 1982 – a fact <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/why-jim-webb-may-become-good-senator.html">someone else</a> seems to not realize.  Ferrara’s revisionist history gets worse when he tries to explain this comment:<br />
<blockquote>The GOP must return to Reaganomics (and Gingrichomics) as it sets sail for 2008.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems Mr. Ferrara believes that the tax burden was lowered during the 1990’s even if most rightwingers argue that it was increased during the Clinton Administration.  While most rightwingers argue that the Reagan deficits were due to runaway Federal spending, Mr. Ferrara would have his readers buy into that Kudlow line about cutting Federal spending “Reagan style”.  Of course, the facts show that the ratio of Federal spending to GDP neither rose nor fell to any appreciable degree during the Reagan years.  </p>
<p>But why 2008 and not now?  Does the National Review just wish to ingore the large Federal deficits for the next two years?  Oh wait &#8211; the GOP does not have a plan to deal with the deficit.  After all &#8211; they created it so it is up to the Democrats to deal with it.</p>

Well, it appears that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/16/bush.hanoi.ap/index.html">President Bush</a> is in Vietnam saying that past war offers lessons for the Iraq adventure:<br />
<blockquote>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) &#8211; U.S. President George W. Bush said Friday the United States&#8217; unsuccessful war in Vietnam three decades ago offered lessons for the American-led struggle in Iraq. &#8220;We&#8217;ll succeed unless we quit,&#8221; Bush said shortly after arriving in this one-time war capital. Bush met here with Australian Prime Minister John Howard, one of America&#8217;s strongest allies in Iraq, Vietnam and other conflicts. The president said there were lessons to be learned from the divisive Vietnam war &#8211; the longest conflict in U.S. history &#8211; as the United States wages an unpopular war in Iraq. &#8220;We tend to want there to be instant success in the world, and the task in Iraq is going to take a while,&#8221; the president said. He called the Iraq war a &#8220;great struggle&#8221; and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s just going to take a long period of time for the ideology that is hopeful &#8211; and that is an ideology of freedom &#8211; to overcome an ideology of hate.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ahem! Bush is drawing precisely the wrong lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://blogs.chron.com/whitehouse/archives/2006/11/bush_travels_1.html">Julie Mason</a> tells this joke:<br />
<blockquote>As we all know from his first presidential campaign, Bush has never been to Vietnam before. Here&#8217;s a joke in circulation (we assume the originator prefers to go unnamed):<br />Q: How is Vietnam different from Iraq? <br />A: Bush had a plan for getting out of Vietnam.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch!</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>For the economic know nothings over at the National Review who are saying Jim Webb will be a conservative in their liking, his <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009246">WSJ oped</a> will be a bit of a shock:<br />
<blockquote>The most important &#8211; and unfortunately the least debated &#8211; issue in politics today is our society&#8217;s steady drift toward a class-based system, the likes of which we have not seen since the 19th century. America&#8217;s top tier has grown infinitely richer and more removed over the past 25 years. It is not unfair to say that they are literally living in a different country. Few among them send their children to public schools; fewer still send their loved ones to fight our wars. They own most of our stocks, making the stock market an unreliable indicator of the economic health of working people. The top 1% now takes in an astounding 16% of national income, up from 8% in 1980. The tax codes protect them, just as they protect corporate America, through a vast system of loopholes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the whole piece as it is quite good.  I’m saddened to say I learned about this piece by linking to our favorite troll Patrick R. Sullivan aka <a href="http://flyunderthebridge.blogspot.com/2006/11/tales-of-two-quarter-centuries.html">Roland Patrick</a> who makes the incredibly stupid mistake of presenting aggregate real GDP growth as if that somehow counters a claim about income distribution.  But it gets better in two ways.  The first:<br />
<blockquote>But, as the graph at the top makes clear, in the last quarter century (1982-2006, inclusive) there were only two (and short and mild) recessions. Compare that to the previous 25 years (1956-1981) with its six recessions.</p></blockquote>
<p>William Poole – take note that the Federal Reserve has paid attention to what you wrote back in 1970.  But Patrick needs to look at his own graph as it shows a third and rather deep recession in 1982.  And why did we get the 1982 recession?  It was the Federal Reserve’s overreaction to an ill-advised excessive fiscal stimulus that President Reagan pushed with his 1981 tax cut.  You know – the one that the economic know nothings over at the National Review and their ilk (we are talking about you Patrick) incessantly praise.  Which brings me to the second:<br />
<blockquote>We seem to have a clear picture of which period &#8216;working people&#8217; are better off. Does Webb really think that allowing high income earners to pay at lower tax rates (on more reported income) is too high a price for the comparative economic bliss of the last twenty five years?</p></blockquote>
<p>Supply-side spin again.  I guess Patrick thinks the 3.0% real GDP growth under Reagan and Bush41 or the 2.5% real GDP growth under Bush43 trumps the 3.7% real GDP growth under Clinton or the 3.5% real GDP growth from 1947 to 1980.  Simply put – fiscal stimulus lowers national savings which lowers long-term growth. </p>
<p>But Patrick was talking about business cycles, which have become less severe now that we actually listen to Bill Poole.  Of course, such economic know nothings miss the point that screwing up fiscal policy makes life at the Federal Reserve more difficult.  But what can you say about someone who celebrates the life of Milton Friedman by thinking we are all <a href="http://flyunderthebridge.blogspot.com/2006/11/giant-passes.html">fixed velocity monetarists</a> now (no offense to <a href="http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Econ_Articles/monetarism.html">Brad DeLong</a> as I seriously doubt Patrick actually read what you wrote).</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://tailrank.com/840033/Webb-notices-that-there-are-two-Americas">Tailrank</a> links to several blogs who covered Webb’s WSJ oped.  Liberals liked it – no surprise.  Our friends on the right had two basic reactions: (1) the usual canard about Democrats having no plan; and (2) and the <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-should-dems-do.html">Greg Mankiw</a> line:<br />
<blockquote>Free-market economists like me are typically less concerned about rising inequality</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh?  One can recognize the efficiency benefits of competition and still be concerned about the distribution of income.</p>

<blockquote>Whether they agree or disagree with Friedman&#8217;s economic prescriptions, I think that nearly every economist in the world would acknowledge that he was a giant in the field. Friedman&#8217;s own work &#8211; as well as the voluminous work done as a direct reaction to his work &#8211; played a huge role in shaping the field of economics, and in changing our understanding of the powers and limitations of economic policy-making.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Justin Norton notes:<br />
<blockquote>Friedman married Rose Director in 1938. They had two children, Janet and David, and Rose was co-author of some of his books.</p></blockquote>
<p>I did have the incredible pleasure of meeting Rose and Milton Friedman as well as later having dinner with their very smart son, David, who insisted he never had any formal training in economics. Our thoughts go out to David, Janet, and Rose for the loss of one of the great ones.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/11/milton_friedman.html">Brad DeLong</a> will likely miss Dr. Friedman’s integrity:<br />
<blockquote>There&#8217;s a story that at lunch at the White House in 2002 he told George W. Bush exactly what he thought about Bush&#8217;s unpaid-for tax cuts. We will miss him.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>My thanks to Bruce Bartlett (a true fiscal conservative) for emailing a link to something he rightfully calls <a href="http://www.policybytes.org/blog/PolicyBytes.nsf/dx/conservative-tax-collectors-for-the-welfare-state.htm">nonsense</a>. That the ultra-conservatives at the Institute for Policy Innovation are opposed to any form of tax increase does not surprise me.  IPI claims that we can reduce Federal spending to an amount between 10% to 15% of GDP:<br />
<blockquote>What Frum is missing is the work I and other conservatives have done over the years in developing entitlement reforms that would successfully address this coming crisis of big government.  Key to that is personal accounts for Social Security.  The Ryan-Sununu bill alone would reduce Federal spending as a percent of GDP by 5 percentage points.  Later expanding the accounts to disability and survivors benefits would reduce Federal spending by another 1.5 percentage points of GDP.  Later expanding the accounts to Medicare would again sharply reduce Federal spending relative to GDP.  The second big idea is block granting the remaining welfare programs back to the states, as in the highly successful 1996 reform of AFDC.  Such reform now needs to be extended to the other big Federal welfare programs, particularly Medicaid, but also Food Stamps and housing programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>What IPI seems to be suggesting is to eliminate our Social Security benefits so what we thought were payroll contributions have been transformed to employment taxes.  That’s not a tax increase?  IPI is also suggesting that we cut off Federal revenue sharing with the states, which would either mean that state taxes would have to go up or transfer payments would have to be slashed.  Excuse me – but someone’s net taxes would be increased.  </p>
<p>But the goods news here is that <a href="http://frum.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NGJkMWU4YmY4NDJjMWI3N2FmZmNmZTE0MTc5MjlhZDg=">David Frum</a> has finally figured out that someone’s taxes have to be increased:<br />
<blockquote>The federal government today consumes about 20% of national income. If left unchecked, the cost of paying for the boomers&#8217; retirement will push that burden up toward 30% in the not at all distant future. If conservatives can halt the growth at 25%, we will have done brilliantly well. But it&#8217;s inescapable: The federal government will need more revenue, lots more revenue, and very soon. How is it to be raised? If we leave the job to the Dems, it will be raised in the most economically destructive ways, by taxing work, saving, and investment. If we want to lighten the load on those beneficial activities, we must find something else to tax instead. Bruce Bartlett has proposed an across-the-board value-added tax. I prefer a carbon tax ie, a tax on all forms of energy except wind, solar, and (yay!) nuclear.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this is progress for Mr. Frum, he failed to tell us how high his tax rate on energy would be or how much revenue he expects it to generate.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Every so often, the subject of energy independence becomes something to which people pay attention.  Its usually when the price of gasoline goes up, and/or when the leader of Venezuela or Iran or whoever the latest incarnation of evil happens to be makes some stupid noises, and/or before someone gets invaded.  </p>
<p>I would imagine a reasonable way to measure energy independence, at least in the short term, is through the ratio of energy produced (in the US) to the total amount of energy consumed in the US, both of which are measured in btu.  </p>
<p>Back in 1949, the US produced 99.2% of all the energy it consumed.  By 2005, that figure was about 69%.  Thus, we’re not exactly becoming more independent, but rather less.  This, um, progress(?) has been a bipartisan affair… the table below shows the annual change in the energy independence, by presidency, since Ike.</p>
<p>Ike_____-1.03<br />JFK______0.03<br />LBJ______-0.35 <br />Nixon___-1.50<br />Ford____-1.63<br />Carter___1.21<br />Reagan_-0.33<br />GHW____-0.46<br />Clinton_-1.17<br />GW____-0.56</p>
<p>Now, you may be thinking… so what?  Its not like the gubmint can do anything about energy consumption.  Well… perhaps.  But… consider the only President under whom there was a non-trivial increase in energy independence, Jimmy Carter.  Sure, the increase was partly due to the free market making adaptations, Mr. Carter also used his bully pulpit to make Americans care about the issue.  Consider the symbolic acts alone… Carter installed solar panels and a wood burning stove at the White House (removed almost immediately upon the arrival of St. Ronald the Reagan), wore sweaters, and even got attacked by a bunny.   (I’m sure the rabbit thing is unrelated to energy independence, but its always fun to note.)   But were any of the changes more than symbolic?  Was there any walk behind the talk?</p>
<p>Spending on the DOE might be a good proxy for how much an administration cares about energy issues.  Data on the government’s budget by department goes back to 1976… the annual percentage change (geometric) in real per capita spending on the DOE, and the annual change in the percentage of the total budget allocated to the DOE are shown below (data runs through 2005)</p>
<p>____per capita___share of budget<br />Carter___9.87%____0.03<br />Reagan___-5.08%___-0.08<br />GHW______5.45%____0.05<br />Clinton___-5.07%___-0.05<br />GW_______3.05%____0.00</p>
<p>Carter increased real spending per capita on energy independence by more than any other President in the sample.  </p>
<p>But… is there a relationship between the DOE budget and energy independence?  Who knows?  But I ran some correlations… the table below shows the correlation between energy independence in any given year, and the DOE’s share of the budget in a given year.</p>
<p>DOE’s share, t-x______Correlation with Energy Indep, Year t<br />X = 0___________________0.51<br />X = 1___________________0.60<br />X = 2___________________0.73<br />X = 3___________________0.81<br />X = 4___________________0.83<br />X = 5___________________0.80<br />X = 6___________________0.78</p>
<p>The table seems to indicate that the DOE’s budget is correlated with energy independence.  It also seems to indicate that most of the bang for the buck comes around in the fourth year.</p>
<p>Similar results are obtained using the DOE’s real budget per capita.  In addition, I looked at different types of energy produced… this correlation is very strong for production of crude oil and natural gas, but not for coal, nukeelar (is that how GW would spell it?) power, or renewable energy.  For context… US output (in 2005), in billion btus:</p>
<p>Coal:  23 million<br />Crude: 10.8 million<br />Natural Gas:  21 million<br />Nuclear:  8.1 million<br />Renewable:  6.1 million</p>
<p>Data:<br /><a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/stb0101.xls"> Energy Consumption</a><br /><a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/stb0102.xls"> Energy Production</a><br /><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist05z3.xls"> DOE as a share of total budget</a><br /><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist17z5.xls"> Population</a><br /><a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt"> CPI</a></p>
<p>Caveat to note… Energy consumption and production data in calendar years.  DOE budget, population in fiscal years.  Inflation calculated in fiscal years.</p>
<p>Correction &#8211; Corrected a hallucination about Reagan increasing spending on energy as a share of the budget.</p>
<p>Additional Note:  I haven&#8217;t really thought through the idea of energy independence.  I&#8217;m not sure its a good thing or not&#8230; I can certainly see pros and cons.  In this post, I&#8217;m merely putting up the numbers to show what actually happened, not expressing an opinion about what should happen.  That said, I wouldn&#8217;t mind hearing reader&#8217;s opinions about what should happen.</p>
<p>More corrections/comments&#8230;  <br />1.  Pct change in real spending per capita was computed incorrectly originally.  Magnitudes changed a bit.  Computed using geometric means to obtain the true annual percentage change.   For example, for Carter&#8230; the annual percentage change was 9.87%.  Then&#8230; Carter&#8217;s starting real spending per capita ($69.25) times (1.0987)^(4) = $100.91, which happens to be real spending per capita in 1980/<br />2.  Using simple averages to compute changes in figures that are shown in percentage terms.  For example, when computing the change in coal produced as a percentage of total energy produced&#8230; because that figure is already in percentage terms, for Carter&#8217;s term, I am simply taking the value for 1980, subtracting the 1976 value, and dividing by 4.</p>
