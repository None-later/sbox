                                <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aFsdjjZ3hSec&#038;refer=home">Documentation of a minor disruption</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Lehman won&#8217;t return &#8220;billions&#8221; of frozen prime-brokerage assets &#8220;in the short term,&#8221; said PricewaterhouseCoopers, administrator for the Lehman bankruptcy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, several hedge funds are planning to sing the Bono phrase from &#8220;Do They Know It&#8217;s Xmastime?&#8221;* to their cohorts at Morgan Stanley:<br />
<blockquote>Hedge funds that account for less than 10 percent of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s prime-brokerage balances this week withdrew their money or told the firm they planned to, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the really good news:<br />
<blockquote>The loss of all hedge-fund accounts wouldn&#8217;t materially affect the company&#8217;s access to reserves, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information is confidential.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not certain I would take that as encouraging.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Hedge funds tend to look at counterparty risk as they would an equity investment,&#8221; said Adam Sussman, director of research at TABB Group LLC, a New York-based adviser to financial-services companies. &#8220;If they&#8217;d bet against the stock, they&#8217;d also be likely to minimize their exposure to their prime brokerage and trading over-the-counter derivatives with them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe Bloomberg just indicated that the hedge funds leaving Morgan Stanley are &#8220;voting with their feet.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Foremost on people&#8217;s minds is ensuring that wherever they decide to put assets, they will be secure,&#8221; [BNP Paribas SA&#8217;s global head of hedge-fund relationships, Talbot Stark] said in an interview today.</p></blockquote>
<p>With <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/flight-to-quality/">Treasuries yielding 0.00%</a>—about the same as your mattress, except with no option value—&#8221;security&#8221; has become more important than (to borrow an old phrase from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankers_Trust">a deceased-but-no-longer-mourned firm</a>) Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC).</p>
<p>And it appears that the Wizard of Id&#8217;s version of the Golden Rule** <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080918/wall_street.html">still applies</a>.  Even if it <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/how-wall-streets-quants-lied-to-their-computers/">really was their fault</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The people who ran the financial firms chose to program their risk-management systems with overly optimistic assumptions and to feed them oversimplified data. This kept them from sounding the alarm early enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe more on this later.</p>
<p>*&#8221;Well tonight thank G-d it&#8217;s them/Instead of you&#8221;<br />**&#8221;He who has the gold makes the rules&#8221;</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As the world financial markets head into complete meltdown, it is worth taking a moment to look back to see where much of this began. A significant portion of the current crisis stems from the shadow banking system’s dependence upon the explosive growth in derivatives market. Put simply, these complex financial instruments are meant to monetize risk of default. Futures contracts, options, swaps, and many others allow one party to insure money is exchanged, but the outcome of the contract depend upon many underlying factors that make up the terms of the contract. Though many forms of derivatives are traded in exchanges, many are not necessarily.</p>
<p>Derivatives that not necessarily traded on market floors are known as “over-the-counter” derivatives. They are usually bilateral contracts between investment banks and a customer and can be generated simply over the phone or over the internet. This form of contracting is largely unregulated. The OTC market has been monitored by the Bank for International Settlements since at 1998, and they publish detailed information on various forms of OTC derivatives every six months. The most recent data can be found <a href="http://www.bis.org/statistics/derdetailed.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>This market was very big in 1998, but it has exploded since then. I’ve generated a figure of the amounts outstanding of OTC derivatives since 1998 broken down into their various types.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SNJqgUFUXII/AAAAAAAAALQ/1-lyCN7hhcU/s1600-h/total_OTC.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SNJqgUFUXII/AAAAAAAAALQ/1-lyCN7hhcU/s400/total_OTC.JPG" alt="" border="0"></a><br />You should note that the Y-axis is in billions of dollars. Yes, billions. That means, as of Dec 2007 (for which BIS has the most recent data), the total OTC derivative market was almost $600 trillion. With a T. Thus, in 10 years it has gown 826%.</p>
<p>The growth is even more shocking if you look at some of the subcategories of OTC derivatives. Below is a figure illustrating the percentage of amount of outstanding contracts relative to the amount outstanding in June 1998 for interest rate contracts, commodity contracts, and credit default swaps.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SNJqnQTgotI/AAAAAAAAALY/3Sa7TNrdk1A/s1600-h/comm_CDS_interest.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SNJqnQTgotI/AAAAAAAAALY/3Sa7TNrdk1A/s400/comm_CDS_interest.JPG" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Though commodity contracts still make up only a small proportion of the total OTC contracts outstanding (1.5%), its growth has been astronomical, increasing over 2,000% since June of 1998. Even interest rate contracts, which make up the largest portion (66%) of all OTC derivatives, increased over 900% in 10 years. And most troubling of all is the credit default swap market. These are contracts that are activated in the event of a default.<br />This market has increased 905% in just three and a half years since BIS starting monitoring this form of derivative. It was a mere $6.4 trillion in Dec 2004; In Dec of 2007 this market ballooned to $57.9 trillion. Just think of the unwinding of credit default swaps that is involved when big investment banks like Lehman Bros. go under.</p>
<p>Of course, all of it is very complicated, because derivatives are essentially a “zero-sum” instrument. The way derivatives are supposed to function is that money is exchanged depending on the outcome. Nothing is lost, at least in an ideal environment; it is only exchanged hands. One side wins, the other looses. So it isn&#8217;t exactly clear what will happen as these contracts are unwound. But what happens when one party of the contract can’t pay?</p>
<p>I think we’re going to see that many times over very soon…</p>
<p>UPDATE: Be sure to read <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/diamond-and-kashyap-on-the-recent-financial-upheavals/">this excellent piece</a> from the Freakonomics blog explaining the current crisis and the roles of the major players as it stands right now (H/T <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/3315013635937196179/?a=47620#720916">Bear</a>). They mention that one of the major reasons that AIG was saved was their heavy dependence upon CDSs, $57 billion worth, according to the post. That is exactly 0.1% of the outstanding CDSs according to BIS statistics as of Dec 2007. I&#8217;m sure the other 99.9% is perfectly fine&#8230;</p>

Enjoy!<br />Since Monday the McCain camp has stepped up its personal attacks against Alaskans. They’ve continued their D.C.-style tactics against neighbors in this small state. The game plan is to find an excuse to stop our Legislature’s Troopergate investigation, and hide evidence McCain’s folks really don’t want to surface before November’s election. It’s been a little Karl Rove, and parts Laurel and Hardy. How else can you explain the following?</p></blockquote>
<p>Rdan here&#8230;Instead of interpreting or spotlight sections of Les Gara&#8217;s article in Mudflats, the rest follows under the fold.  It speaks for itself eloquently.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Last week the Attorney general’s office promised state witnesses would comply with subpoenas the Legislature issued last week. Tuesday the Governor’s Attorney General flip flopped, and announced that state witnesses wouldn’t comply because, well, and I’m paraphrasing here &#8211; he’s changed his mind. And in what has to be an idea hatched after a 4th Martini at Chilkoot Charlie’s, Governor Palin’s attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the ethics claim she filed against herself two weeks ago. Yup. She really filed a complaint against herself. Tuesday she said she’s discovered, after a thorough investigation of herself, that she’s done nothing wrong. Does anyone know how to get a hold of Jon Stewart and Tina Fey?<br />It’s silly season up here in the far north, but this week’s moves are aimed at one thing: John McCain’s effort to find cover for being disingenuous. See, before Governor Palin’s nomination for the Republican VP spot, she did the honest thing. She admitted the evidence &#8211; of roughly 20 contacts between her staff and husband with Public Safety officials, seeking the firing of Governor Palin’s former brother-in-law &#8211; might lead a reasonable person to the conclusion that the she misused her office to fire a state employee. So when Alaska’s Republican-led Legislature called for an investigation, she did the honorable thing and said she and her staff would comply. She denies any wrongdoing.<br />Things changed on August 29 when Governor Palin was added to the McCain ticket. Since then his handlers have told her she can’t testify. They don’t want the evidence in this case to come out. They don’t want her to testify under oath. They don’t want other witnesses to testify under oath. So they have engaged in daily maneuvers to attack, as disloyal to the McCain campaign, anyone who wants the investigation to move forward. They’ve now attacked two well respected prosecutors, and perhaps the state’s most highly regarded law enforcement official &#8211; the Public Safety Commissioner she hired, and then fired, Walt Monegan.<br />Every day this week McCain operatives have sung the same tune. Today a guy with an East Coast accent, who knows nothing about Alaska, stood in front of a McCain-Palin banner to lead the attacks against people he doesn’t know. At press conferences on Monday and Tuesday campaign staffer Megan Stapleton spit vitriol to repeat her argument that this investigation is really a “Democratic” attack on Governor Palin.<br />See, that’s easier than just saying their VP has reneged on her promise to testify. It’s easier than just saying they don’t want anyone testifying before the November election. It’s easier than admitting they are stonewalling a legislative investigation.<br />Here are a few things they failed to say. There are a few small facts that make it hard to style this as a Democratic investigation. One is that Alaska is a Republican State. We have a Republican Governor and a Legislature of 34 Republicans and 26 Democrats. This summer the Legislature’s Legislative Council voted 12-0 (8 Republicans and 4 Democrats) to hire an investigator, and appointed Democratic Senator Hollis French, a well-respected former prosecutor, to find an investigator. Governor Palin stated she and her employees would comply with the investigation. French then hired Steve Branchflower, a former DA who most recently was hired by legislative Republicans to run the state’s Office of Victims rights. <br />And on Friday the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 3-2 (2 Democrats and 1 Republican in favor); and the House Judiciary Committee issued a 7 &#8211; 0 (5 Republicans, 2 Democrats) advisory vote, to issue subpoenas to witnesses the McCain camp had previously stopped from testifying.<br />Over the last two days McCain’s outside operatives have vilified former prosecutor Hollis French &#8211; as an Obama supporter who must have called this investigation to hurt the McCain ticket. But French was appointed to oversee the investigation by a 12 &#8211; 0 Legislative Council vote, and is probably the state’s most respected legislator &#8211; by Republicans and Democrats alike. He’s so popular the Republican Party couldn’t find anyone to run against him this year.<br />They’ve called former Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan &#8211; a Native Alaskan who has served Republican and Democratic Administrations with honor, and put his life on the line in uniform &#8211; “insubordinate.” Odd, given that when Governor Palin fired him she offered him a different job. I guess being “insubordinate” was a job requirement for the new position. And they’ve challenged the independence of an investigator and former DA, who has no animus anyone can find. <br />Those Swift boat ads taught the McCain folks that if you say something untrue enough times, it can stick.<br />My favorite moment of the week came when Governor Palin’s attorneys filed a motion to dismiss Palin’s ethics complaint against herself. Stay with me. Her attorneys have been buying the peyote, not me. See, on August 29 they needed to find a way to stop the Legislature’s investigation. They tried asking the Republican leaders to call it off, and take one for the team. But the Senate President and others honorably said no. So they came up with an argument that the State Personnel Board &#8211; 3 people appointed by Governor Palin and her Republican predecessor Frank Murkowski &#8211; had “exclusive jurisdiction” to investigate wrongdoing by the Governor. The Legislature wasn’t amused. So Governor Palin then filed a complaint against herself.<br />That, they said, put “jurisdiction” in the hands of their friends at the Personnel Board. They argued that since the Personnel Board was now proceeding with an “investigation”, the Legislature couldn’t. <br />To put icing on the cake, on Monday the Governor’s attorneys moved to dismiss the Governor’s case against herself. They said, and I loosely paraphrase again &#8211; that they tried really hard and just couldn’t find any evidence that the Governor did anything wrong. OK. I can’t believe I just wrote that. And I wish it weren’t true.<br />These are the things you have to do when your Presidential candidate doesn’t want his VP to honor a promise, and doesn’t want evidence to come out before an election. These are the things you have to do if your folks aren’t going to comply with a subpoena. That’s because without spin the headline might read: “McCain Interferes With Investigation Palin Agreed To.” How easy it is to re-write a headline. They learned that during the Swift boat campaign too.<br />All we can hope for is that members of the press will remember what they learned in journalism school. Not to repeat the spin of political operatives without reporting the truth. Not to write “he said she said” stories, and pretend the truth is somewhere in the middle. But to report the facts. No matter how you spin it, Governor Palin promised to comply with this Legislative Investigation. McCain’s folks got her to change her position. And the Legislature that voted for the investigation did so on a bi-partisan basis. End of story. End of headline.<br />Over the next few days McCain’s folks will try to get local legislators to step in line, out of party loyalty, and reverse their vote to investigate Troopergate. But many local Republicans, like Senate President Lyda Green, have so far refused to play those politics.<br />Stay for more from McCain’s Campaign for “Change.” They’ve tried to change the truth. They’ve succeeded at changing Governor Palin’s promise to comply with this investigation. Let’s see what they’ll change next.<br />Thanks for really being out there on the Mudflats, Les. Hey, if this ‘being a great politician’ thing doesn’t work out, you’re always welcome here.</p></blockquote>

<p>Reuters totaled up the cost of the bail-out so far, and their figure sits at <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSN16126320080917">900 billion</a>.  Since GDP last quarter came in at <a href="http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">14 and a quarter trillion</a>, we&#8217;re talking about the federal government and the Federal Reserve putting up an amount equal to about 6.3% of the economy.  Sure, most of it is in the form of loans and financing and stuff, and its impossible to say how much of that total will be lost forever.  </p>
<p>As I write this, the Dow is now just about where it was when GW took office, 8 years ago.  And that&#8217;s nominal, not adjusted for inflation.  Put another way, money in the stock market lost money over the past eight years.  My wife and I took all of our money out of all the sectors that are in trouble today about a year ago, and yet our portfolio has taken one heck of a hit recently, so its not just a matter of picking what to avoid.  We avoided all the big losers, and still got hammered.</p>
<p>So if I may play a poor man&#8217;s  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/bruce-webb-on-social-security.html">Bruce Webb</a>, let me wonder about the following&#8230;  Say that the president and the cheerleaders, the folks who gave us this bail-out, had succeeded in privatizing Social Security back when he took office.  After eight years of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">pretty piddly growth</a> and a tanking stock market, a lot of people would find their retirement fund depleted, and folks dependent on that retirement fund would be in deep trouble.  I wonder &#8211; would GW and the cheerleaders, the folks who brought you a &#8220;bankruptcy reform&#8221; law written by the credit card companies, support having the government prop up millions of ordinary Americans, most of them retirees, to the tune of $900 billion over a period of a few weeks?  <br />_________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p>I have posted <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2008/09/unsophisticated-debate-on-mccain-health.html">a deliberately unsophisticated discussion at my other blog</a></p>
<p>After the jump, I try to add something to Tom Bozzo&#8217;s post below (which you should read first because he actually knows something about the issues).</p>
<p>Here I take as fact Buchmueller et al&#8217;s assertion (as summarized by Bozzo but at least I admit it) that a typical family health plan costs employers $12,000 and a similarly generous plan costs $14,000 on the individual market.</p>
<p>I think about how employers might respond to the McCain plan.</p>
<p>First I&#8217;m sure many will just keep on keeping on providing health insurance to employees with the same limited range of options (maybe one size fits all, definitely &#8220;no thanks, I&#8217;ll get mine on the individual market&#8221; is not an option). The plan will simply be a tax increase for their employees*.  I think the McCain team sincerely thinks this is no big deal, because they think tax treatment is the real reason for employer provided health care, so they assume few employers will be so dumb and no one will want to work for them unless they increase wages to bear the cost of the tax and that would drive any really stubborn firm bankrupt.</p>
<p>Basically, I think they assume that either employers will have nothing to do with health insurance or, at least, they will give employees the option of taking the benefit as cash instead of health insurance. </p>
<p>I think that this is about the same thing, to a rough approximation.  The advantage to insurance companies of selling insurance to employers is that the employees don&#8217;t have a choice and so the insurance companies don&#8217;t have to market or, more importantly, worry about adverse selection.  I think that, quickly if not immediately, insurance formally provided by the employer but with an opt out, will vanish as the important lasting difference from the individual market will just be the $5,000 credit. </p>
<p>OK so why did I slip in the weasel word &#8220;lasting&#8221;.  Well given how scared people are of the individual market, I think it would take a long time for the more healthy to all opt out of employer provided coverage, so the adverse selection in the employer provided pool will only slowly become as severe as that in the individual market.</p>
<p>So I claim an either/or either a lot of people will have employer provided insurance whether they want it or not, so the plan is a tax increase on them, or the plan will, for practical purposes, eliminate employer provided health insurance.</p>
<p>Now, assuming the extra $2,000 calculation is accurate, where does the money go ?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure only a small part of it goes to health insurance company profits.  I would guess that the individual health insurance market is quite competitive and the profit rate, while probably higher than in group markets due to bargaining power, is nowhere near 28% of sales higher.</p>
<p>Some goes to increased marketing administrative and screening costs and amounts to pure inefficiency.</p>
<p>Some goes to the free riders who get a (partially) free ride.  That is the other side of adverse selection is that some healthy people benefit by not having insurance.  If they are insured they subsidize the less healthy.  If they are not they get some health care without paying for it (if they go bankrupt or if the provider gives up on chasing after them to pay the bill).</p>
<p>If Buechmuller et al are right then, there is another either/or.</p>
<p>Unless the McCain plan increases the number of uninsured, it would cause the US to waste about $2,000 per family that currently has employer provided coverage.  Not as huge a waste as the Iraq war but well over $100,000,000,000/year (way more than total earmarks which aren&#8217;t pure waste).</p>
<p>The actual waste will be lower as part of the cost to (employers + the treasury + the insured) will be an increased transfer to the increased number of free loading uninsured.  It will also be lower as some people will stick (or be stuck) with employer provided insurance with no opt out and so they will just pay more in taxes.</p>
<p>But the plan is partly a tax increase, partly a windfall for freeloaders and partly increased waste.</p>
<p>Importantly, the McCain supporters argument that the plan will benefit tax payers is based on assumptions about responses such that it will reduce tax revenues.  It is typical Republican logic to assume that cutting taxes gives benefits to taxpayers at no cost to anyone ever, but it is still nonsense. </p>
<p>Now what is the logic of serious economists who helped design the McCain plan (Douglas Holtz-Eakin is, for all I know, not the only serious economist on the McCain team, and he is serious or, at least, he was, when they were working on the plan).</p>
<p>The argument is that, on the individual market, people will purchase plans less generous than the one they get from their employer.  That their having skin in the game will make their health care consumption choices more efficient and that this outweighs the increased costs of marketing, administering and screening.  Basically I find this argument absurd, because it if it were true one would imagine that  the US health care is more efficient that that of other developed countries and it obviously isn&#8217;t.  But that is very crude data.  To get more micro (much more micro) I suspect that underuse of health care (statins, oral anti-diabetics, insulin, anti-hypertensives, antacids that actually work and prevent ulcers, cancer screening etc etc etc) is more costly than overuse (even though the cost of accelerated morbidity is just interest on the cost of people getting deathly ill as most do before dying).  Experimental evidence (the RAND study) suggests that copayments reduce demand equally for necessary and un-necessary treatment.</p>
<p>* and update:  I was totally confused about the McCain plan.  Sorry.  Should have done my homework.  If one still gets insurance from one&#8217;s employer, the change is pay income tax but get the $2,500 or $5,000 for a family.  For most people, this is a tax cut.  It is a tax increase only for people in the 33% bracket (over $200,000/yr if married filing jointly) with more costly than average insurance.  The way McCain manages to cut almost everyone&#8217;s taxes while giving a lot to those with low incomes and/or without insurance is by adding 1.4 trillion More to the 10 year budget deficit.  </p>
<p>He&#8217;s addressing the problem by throwing money at it.</p>

<blockquote>But those don’t matter as much as what Obama offers, which is a deeply conservative view of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>He continues:<br />
<blockquote>Nobody can read Obama’s books (which, it is worth noting, he wrote himself) or listen to him speak without realizing that this is a thoughtful, pragmatic, and prudent man. It gives me comfort just to think that after eight years of George W. Bush we will have a president who has actually read the Federalist Papers.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Tax Foundation sent me an e-mail pointing me to <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/blog/show/23599.html">Gerald Prante</a> (who&#8217;s participated in our comments section in the past) taking <a href="http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/09/mccains_health_care_tax_increa.html">Joe Klein</a> to task for calling McCain&#8217;s proposed $5,000* refundable tax credit that would offset income tax on health insurance benefits &#8220;insufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the McCain web site has to say:<br />
<blockquote>While still having the option of employer-based coverage, every family will receive a direct refundable tax credit &#8211; effectively cash &#8211; of $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families to offset the cost of insurance. Families will be able to choose the insurance provider that suits them best and the money would be sent directly to the insurance provider. Those obtaining innovative insurance that costs less than the credit can deposit the remainder in expanded Health Savings Accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The McCain campaign already deserves a few demerits for this representation of the plan.  First, they don&#8217;t mention the tax increase that the health insurance credit offsets.  Second, a credit that&#8217;s provided directly to insurers in lieu of (some) insurance premiums and then could be rolled over into an HSA if there&#8217;s something left over (which there won&#8217;t be for any family buying low-deductible health insurance) doesn&#8217;t sound much like it&#8217;s &#8220;effectively cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Klein calls the McCain credit &#8220;insufficient&#8221; because it won&#8217;t pay the premium for typical employer-provided family coverage.  (<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/411750_updated_candidates_summary.pdf">Analysis</a> [PDF] of the plan by the Tax Policy Center indeed yields the result that the McCain plan would not provide for much insurance uptake among the currently-uninsured.)  Prante claims that Klein doesn&#8217;t know the difference between a credit and a deduction, and provides a calculation purporting to show that the value of the deduction that McCain would repeal is less than the credit:<br />
<blockquote>What [Klein] fails to understand is that the $5,000 value of the credit would be worth more than the current exclusion for almost any taxpayer. For example, a family in the 25% bracket would have its income tax before credits increase by .25 * 12,000 = $3,000. However, the family would be getting a $5,000 CREDIT that trumps the $3,000 extra in taxes from the elimination of the exclusion. Even&#8230; in the 35% bracket, the family having $12,000 in insurance would come out ahead.</p></blockquote>
<p>End of story?  Not quite.</p>
<p>In the quibble department, Prante assumes that the federal income tax exclusion can be repealed without state tax consequences.  To the extent state income definitions follow the feds, state taxes would take away several hundred more dollars of the credit.</p>
<p>The big question is whether today&#8217;s $12,000 employer-sponsored plan would still be available for no more than $12,000.  That depends on factors such as the employer exercising its &#8220;option&#8221; to continue to offer a group plan, and healthy members of the group resisting the incentives that the McCain plan provides to defect to the high-deductible insurance/HSA combination.</p>
<p>While McCain promotes the &#8220;option&#8221; of retaining existing coverage, the McCain plan&#8217;s incentives exacerbate &#8220;adverse selection death spiral&#8221; problems that particularly affect small groups under current policies.  That is, increasing the price of insurance coverage on the margin would encourage the healthy and/or lucky-feeling to exit relatively expensive group plans, with the tax credit intended to encourage substituting the combination of a high-deductible individual plan and accompanying HSA.  This leaves the comprehensive plans&#8217; members sicker, or at least lossier, and drives up prices for remaining participants.  (Repeat until the high price collapses the plan.)  The <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.27.6.w472/DC1">Buchmueller et al. review of the McCain plan</a> in Health Affairs mentions but does not quantify the potential effects of breaking up existing risk pools.</p>
<p>For employees sent to the individual market because employers drop group coverage, Buchmueller et al. suggest that insurance expenditures would increase markedly.  They indicate that the typical $12,000 group policy for a family would cost roughly $2,000 more to obtain in the individual market (and note that many plans in the individual market have lower prices but much lower coverage).</p>
<p>In Prante&#8217;s calculation, the $12,000 policy costs someone in the 25% bracket $9000 after income tax.  The $14,000 equivalent individual policy with the McCain family-level tax credit costs $9000 after income tax.  So we&#8217;ve already exhausted the purported net benefit of the McCain tax credit for a family that wants to keep its coverage but is knocked out of the employer-sponsored group market.  But the situation is actually worse than that, because shifting $9000 in compensation from benefits, which apparently the McCain plan would still exempt from payroll taxes, to wages subjects the compensation in lieu of benefits to payroll tax as well.  This can increase taxes up to $1377 (at 15.3%) in this example, depending on where the hypothetical family&#8217;s wages stand with respect to the Social Security contribution and benefit base (currently $102,000).</p>
<p>Having <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/right-wing-anti-tax-machine-doesnt-have.html">recently seen</a> the Tax Foundation concerned about Obama policies that would raise tax rates a few percentage points on high earners, it would be remiss of me to point out that the combined tax rates on wages paid in lieu of health benefits would be just as high for middle-class taxpayers under McCain&#8217;s health plan. That&#8217;s 25% for federal income tax, 5% or so for state taxes, and 15.3% for payroll taxes, 45.3% altogether, for compensation that current law and Obama policies would tax at 0%!  (A new Tax Foundation <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/23610.html">issue brief</a> on the subject which otherwise mostly <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/395454361/this-is-a-joke.html">invents a big number</a> for the McCain plan&#8217;s reduction in the uninsured does at least acknowledge this in passing.)  Since the McCain plan would, in the estimation of Buchmueller et al., shift millions of workers and their dependents to the individual market (representing 5 to about 15 percent of individuals covered under employer-sponsored plans; references in the article), the prospect of tax increases under the McCain plan is by no means vanishingly rare.  Indeed, shifting people to the individual market is basically a feature of the plan, and not a bug — a part of the program is to de-link employment and health insurance and that&#8217;s a legitimate policy goal.</p>
<p>This also leaves the question of just why conservative health reformers think we need to impose what amounts (vs. current policy) to a Pigovian tax on health insurance.  In the <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.27.6.w462/DC1">companion piece on the Obama plan</a> by Antos et al. also in Health Affairs, there&#8217;s talk of &#8220;perverse incentives&#8221; under the current system but not a lot of beef beyond econ 101-style handwaving:<br />
<blockquote>The following analysis reflects the authors&#8217; concern that Senator Obama&#8217;s failure to address the perverse incentives in the U.S. health system will exacerbate the cost problem he has argued must be solved if we are to achieve anything close to universal coverage. Tax subsidies that promote first-dollar coverage have led consumers, health care providers, and suppliers to act as if any service that might yield some value, no matter how small, should be covered. Subsidized third-party payment has helped drive up health spending and, as demonstrated by the <em>Dartmouth Atlas,</em> sometimes has even led to poorer health outcomes. Realistic expectations about cost, value, and the outcomes that health care is likely to provide must be better understood by all parties.</p></blockquote>
<p>An upshot of recent <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/alice-in-co-payland.html">health-care cost-shifting</a> between employers and employees is that &#8220;first-dollar&#8221; coverage is now rare.  I&#8217;ve had true first-dollar coverage in the distant past, ain&#8217;t got it now, and couldn&#8217;t have it for a premium that would keep my small employer-sponsored group together.  A main idea behind copayments and coinsurance is to avoid some obvious free-as-in-beer-goods problems by not covering the first dollar.</p>
<p>Moreover, they totally beg a central economic efficiency question: given the disconnection between health care prices and marginal costs, it&#8217;s far obvious that allocative efficiency is better served by exposing consumers to something like the list prices of routine services as opposed to the co-payments or co-insurance.  (Exercises: What&#8217;s the marginal cost of a $150-list-price office visit where you spend 5 minutes with a nurse and 5 minutes with the doctor?  Of a $1000 CT scan?  The $200 month&#8217;s supply of an on-patent drug?)  Explanation of benefits forms provide routine evidence that much or most of the price of various health-care services is markup.**</p>
<p>Of course, dynamic efficiency considerations mean that incremental cost constraints must be satisfied somehow — marginal cost prices wouldn&#8217;t be compensatory for the doctors, clinics, and hospitals.  But efficiency-improving pricing arrangments that better align prices with marginal costs such as &#8220;two-part tariffs&#8221; (where customers pay a fixed charge plus variable usage-based charges; see e.g. your electric, gas, or [limited-usage] phone bill) can look a lot more like traditional insurance with what Antos et al. characterize as &#8220;modest&#8221; cost sharing than a high-deductible health plan plus an HSA.  On this front, the conservative reform approach involves an unforgivable conflation of price and cost.***</p>
<p>Nor do some of the &#8220;perversions&#8221; sound all that perverse as features of private or social insurance.  On Obama&#8217;s proposal to establish a federal reinsurance pool, Antos et al. write:<br />
<blockquote>Even though employers would welcome the subsidy, the reinsurance does not reduce health care use or cost. Instead, the policy just shifts some of the cost to the federal budget and could even increase health care spending. Insurers and providers might be encouraged to provide more services to patients who were above the catastrophic threshold since the federal government was sharing in the cost.</p>
<p>The proposal could also lead to anomalous results. One neonatal intensive care stay could lead to federal catastrophic payments for an employer with younger employees (and lower health costs per employee), while an employer with older workers and much higher per employee costs might receive no subsidy for the costs of managing chronic conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is just about 180-degrees backwards.  True, risk-spreading does not in itself reduce the cost of health care, but it does reduce the cost of health insurance, and reducing the cost of insurance helps promote efficient (multi-part) pricing of health care.  Moreover, million-dollar NICU trips and the like are exactly the sort of losses for which reinsurance is appropriate.  In the absence of adequate reinsurance, catastrophic losses are a death-spiral trigger, since especially small groups end up with huge premium increases leading to collapse of the plans one way or another.   As for covering chronic conditions such as aging, the factoid that most of us would like to grow old and healthy, and be well-cared-for in the alternative, suggests a role for intergenerational transfer mechanisms for equitable distribution of the costs.</p>
<p>It might be argued that the reinsurance services could be provided privately, but what I&#8217;ve heard from people involved with such matters at local health insurers is that health care reinsurance isn&#8217;t a candidate for Marginal Revolution&#8217;s &#8216;markets in everything&#8217; series.</p>
<p>Hoisted from our archives, here&#8217;s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/kerrys-health-care-reinsurance.html">Kash from 2004</a> addressing the question of whether the reinsurance pool (also a Kerry proposal) would increase costs:<br />
<blockquote>How would this national reinsurance pool help our nation&#8217;s health care problem? In a couple of ways. First and most obviously, it would simply reduce the cost to health insurers of providing health insurance, resulting in lower premiums. Part of this cost would be shifted to taxpayers, but as we shall see, the cost to taxpayers will be less than the savings reaped by people buying health insurance&#8230;</p>
<p>Think of it this way. Since the claims for one seriously ill person can easily reach $100,000 or more in a year (while most people&#8217;s claims are probably just in the hundreds of dollars), it&#8217;s much harder for an insurance company to predict what the aggregate health care costs will be of a group of 10 people compared to a group of 1,000 people. The law of large numbers means that you can pretty much rely on population averages when trying to guess how much health care the large group will need over the year; but for the small group, you either have to spend a lot of time and energy evaluating each of the 10 individuals to estimate each one&#8217;s likely health care needs for the coming year, or else you have to just take a chance. And insurance companies hate just taking chances.</p>
<p>The best estimates that I have seen by an economist of the effects of this reinsurance proposal are those by Kenneth Thorpe, professor at Emory&#8217;s school of public health. <a href="http://www.sph.emory.edu/hpm/thorpe/nobugthorpe2.pdf">He estimates</a> that the Kerry plan would reduce the variance of firms&#8217; insurance claims by about 50 percent. This in turn will have two effects. It means that it will become dramatically cheaper for small firms to provide health insurance to their employees. Combined with the plan&#8217;s requirement that all participating firms offer health insurance to all employees, Thorpe estimates that about 3 million currently uninsured people will start receiving health insurance. This in turn will help to reduce the country&#8217;s overall health care costs by allowing more preventative care and early detection of health problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is, since insurance costs depend on the variance of the losses, insufficient reinsurance implies higher risk premia paid to insurers, and those premia are big.</p>
<p>So McCain policies would raise taxes on lots of middle-class workers and dramatically increase marginal tax rates on some middle-class earnings regardless of the net benefits (something conservatives wring their hands over in other contexts), not obviously in service of aligning health care prices and marginal costs and without features that promote efficient risk-sharing.  That&#8217;s changiness we shouldn&#8217;t believe in, my friends.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>* For a family; individuals would get $2500.  Observe that there&#8217;s a family insurance penalty in the plan, as family plan premiums are commonly more than double individual premiums.</p>
<p>** E.g., the negotiated price between my health plan and the UW hospital for my son&#8217;s emergency appendectomy last year was roughly 1/3 of list.</p>
<p>*** Yes, people use &#8220;cost&#8221; when they mean &#8220;price&#8221; colloquially all the time; the problem is not considering price/cost ratios carefully when arguing that one price promotes economic efficiency better than another.</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush<br />Update below.</p>
<p>The other day, reading the comments got me thinking about the relationship of peoples income vs their presidential candidate choice.  I think it was about how the economy is doing.  Well, we all say it is bad because all these big, humongous finance institutions are having troubles.  But, my perspective is that the economy is about you and me.  It exists for us.  But, not much is being looked at from that perspective, except for the home mortgage sector.   Simultaneously we hear how we (you, me and thee) have to learn to save more while being asked what can be done to revive the consumer economy.  You know, get it back to the good old days.  Yes-er-y, that&#8217;s a solvable puzzle.  Which good old days do they want to recreate?  The saving days or the consuming days?  If they want both, I would say ok, but we will have to reverse the income shift.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to see if I could create a movement to focus the issue of the economy back onto how you  and me are doing.  It&#8217;s a monumental task, but I&#8217;m game.  I&#8217;ve gotten a little help from McCain in that he has tied the fundamentals of the economy to you and me, the American Worker (stand up and salute!).  As much as &#8220;fundamentals&#8221; are not considered the worker, the reality is we the citizens are the fundament factor in an economy.  No you and me, no exchange of valuable stuff.</p>
<p>So, I have created a chart because I don&#8217;t know how to produce one of those neat colored USA maps of all 50 states, their unemployment rate, hourly wage, 1 yr change of wage, hours worked and 1 yr change of hours worked.  The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/sae/saeaepp.htm">data is from here</a>.  I then color coded the state name based on the <a href="http://www.pollster.com/polls/2008president/">polling map</a> as of 9/16/08.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SNFKNsw_PrI/AAAAAAAAAIc/X_0trekNJNI/s1600-h/State+wage,+hrs+worked,+President+Candidate.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SNFKNsw_PrI/AAAAAAAAAIc/X_0trekNJNI/s400/State+wage,+hrs+worked,+President+Candidate.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />How do you like it?  I&#8217;m rather proud of my self.</p>
<p>The color for the states are blue, light blue, red, light red and black.  I assume the red/blue shades are obvious.  The black are toss-up states.  The data in blue are numbers that did worse than average for the variable to the detriment of the citizen.  If the unemployment was higher than average, it is blue.  If the wage change and hourly wage  was less than average it is blue.  Those in red are negative.  The hours worked and change in hours worked greater than average are in blue.  I view having to work more a negative.  I do not want to have to continually increase my time in the rat race.  Though, some I&#8217;m sure would look at the opportunity to work more as a positive.  You get to earn more.  Well that&#8217;s relative to your opinion of what your free time is worth.  One state has green&#8230;Utah.  It&#8217;s hourly wage and work hours have gone down.  But, hey the unemployment rate is very low.</p>
<p>There are 8 undecided, 18 blue or leaning blue and 24 red or leaning red.<br />14 of 23 states with unemployment below average are voting or tending to vote McCain.   Three undecided have lower rates.   8  states of the 23 are voting or tending to vote Obama.   61% red and 44% blue are below the average unemployment.  </p>
<p>12 of 22 states with above average hours worked increase are red or leaning that way.  8 of are blue.  <br />6 of the 12 state with negative increases in hours worked are red, 4 are undecided which leave 2 blue.  </p>
<p>9 of 26 states that saw negative, zero or less than average 1 year hourly wage increases are red or leaning such.  7 are undecided and 10 are blue or leaning such.   3 of the 6 states with negative hourly wage growth are red, one is undecided and one is blue.  </p>
<p>21 states of 30 who have an average hourly wage less than the national average are red or leaning that way.  5 are blue or leaning such and 4 are undecided.  </p>
<p>18 of the 24 states that work more than the national weekly average hours are red or leaning such.  3 are undecided and 3 are blue.  </p>
<p>6 of 9 states who are working more than the average work week and did not see their wage increase the average amount are red or leaning red.  2 are undecided and 1 is blue.  2 states saw their hourly wage go down and their hours worked go up, both are red.  </p>
<p>Ok, so what are we to make of the voting your pocketbook thought?</p>
<p>Update: Ran some numbers.  Red states average $19.41/hr and 35.73 hours per week for a gross pay of $693.52.  Blue states average $22.68/hr and 34.38 hours per week for a gross pay of $779.74.  Earn more, work less.  Now that is the way to get out of the rat race!</p>
