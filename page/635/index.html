                                <p>Just a quick chart to compare the current situation to the 1970s.</p>
<p>When I ran the chart I did not expect such a nice match.</p>
<p>The price series is West  Texas intermediate.</p>

                                <p>As a direct result of the six-Republican, one Democrat California Supreme Court&#8217;s decision last week, people <a href="http://www.georgetakei.com/news.asp">who have shared everything for 21 years</a> now get to marry. Pull quote:<br />
<blockquote>As a Japanese American, I am keenly mindful of the subtle and not so subtle discrimination that the law can impose. During World War II, I grew up imprisoned behind the barbed wire fences of U.S. internment camps. Pearl Harbor had been bombed and Japanese Americans were rounded up and incarcerated simply because we happened to look like the people who bombed Pearl Harbor. Fear and war hysteria swept the nation. A Presidential Executive Order directed the internment of Japanese Americans as a matter of national security. Now, with the passage of time, we look back and see it as a shameful chapter of American history. President Gerald Ford rescinded the Executive Order that imprisoned us. President Ronald Reagan formally apologized for the unjust imprisonment. President George H.W. Bush signed the redress payment checks to the survivors. It was a tragic and dark taint on American history. [Updated to note: Three Republicans, including an alleged totemic icon. The Ancestral Party used to know how to Do the Right Thing.]</p>
<p>With time, I know the opposition to same sex marriage, too, will be seen as an antique and discreditable part of our history. As U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy remarked on same sex marriage, &#8220;Times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper, in fact, serve only to oppress.&#8221; </p></blockquote>

But I like his chart that compares the Tax Foundation’s “days worked to pay for taxes” versus the graph that shows days worked to pay for government spending:</p>
<blockquote><p>AIER’s Kerry Lynch wrote last April 15. Tax Freedom Day peaked on May 3, 2000, near the end of President Bill Clinton’s administration but before President G. W. Bush signed multiple tax cuts.  Lynch added: “Friedman Day shows that it is not because the government is spending less, but because it is borrowing more, in the name of tomorrow’s taxpayers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since 2000, government spending as a share of GDP has increased even as tax collections have declined.  Murdock isn’t exactly correct in the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Up and up and up perfectly describes the path of federal spending, which constantly rises, as if gravity were reversed &#8230; Republicans are supposed to squelch such rubbish. And yet 100 House Republicans approved it. GOP voters, already disgusted by Republican profligacy, will find this betrayal of their party’s core principles enervating. Democratic voters will back their party’s genetic big spenders, rather than the GOP’s hypocritical posers.</p></blockquote>
<p>We did see a drop in government spending relative to GDP from 1992 to 2000 – and this came under a Democratic Administration.  Odd isn’t since Murdock thinks Democrats are just big spenders.</p>

                                <p>Further lifting (of comments like cactus) by juan:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the term &#8216;speculators&#8217; tends to imply short-term traders while it&#8217;s my understanding that most of the index funds take longer term or more &#8216;sticky&#8217; positions, but this can become a matter of semantics that detracts from what Briese and some others have tried to bring out &#8212; a financialization of price and at least a few of the major actors.</p>
<p>So, a few clips not from the Barron&#8217;s article but another and related posting by Steve Briese:</p>
<blockquote><p>What you didn’t read in the Barron’s cover story<br />[&#8230;]<br />The Commodity Exchange Act addresses excess speculation in commodity markets, and states that “the Commission shall…fix such limits on the amounts of trading which may be done or positions which may be held by any person.” The only exceptions are “to permit producers, purchasers, sellers, middlemen, and users of a commodity or a product derived therefrom to hedge their legitimate anticipated business needs”(7 USC 6a).</p>
<p>The CFTC regulations 17 CFR 1.3(z) further spells out who is to be considered a bona fide hedger in such intricate detail as to make it unmistakable that exemptions to speculative limits are intended only for those commonly known as “the trade” who carry on a cash business in the commodity itself.</p>
<p>The Commission acknowledges that speculative limits apply to indexers: “Mutual funds (or for that matter institutional traders) who want to gain commodity exposure”, whether in an individual commodity future or in several commodity futures that make up an index, are not entitled to an exemption as a bona fide hedger.”</p>
<p>But what agency takes away with one hand, it gives back with the other: “Swaps dealers that have swap agreements with clients that provide the clients with a return on an index of commodities can hedge the exposure from that agreement by buying futures contracts in the commodities underlying the index.”</p>
<p>The illogic of limiting position sizes for indexers dealing directly in futures while exempting indexers who use a swap deal intermediary has apparently not escaped the Commission’s attention. And it has a proposal on the table to correct this inequity. In November the agency proposed new exemptions for “risk management positions,” which would open the door to all indexers while, of course, leaving the swap dealer exemptions in place.<br />[&#8230;]<br />In proposing the new exemptions, the CFTC acknowledges that index-based positions differ enough from bona fide hedges as to make hedge exemptions inappropriate under current law. It does not state where it found the authority to classified swap dealers as hedgers in the first place. It is also unclear why swap dealers should be accorded special treatment.</p>
<p>Their cozy arrangement began during the Reagan Administration under CFTC Chairman Wendy Graham (the other half of the Texas Senator Phil Grahm’s duo that Barron’s dubbed “Mr. &#038; Mrs. Enron”). She began exempting swaps from CFTC oversight in 1989, and in 1992 granted Enron regulatory exemption for its energy-swap operation just five days before resigning her Chair to join Enron’s audit committee.</p>
<p>In 2000 the CFTC officially granted dealers broad relief with the result that today swaps are cleared through the US futures clearing systems alongside futures contracts, thus affording exchange level payment guarantees to non-exchange traded and non-regulated derivative contracts.</p>
<p>Then in 2006, in undertaking a “Comprehensive Review of the Commitments of Traders Report” the Commission acknowledged that its practice of reporting the positions of swap dealers under the “commercial” category may be misleading. Though it received a record public response with practical unimity for continued and expanded position reporting, it bowed to the one dissenter.</p>
<p>The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), although opposed to a separate reporting category altogether, allowed that “If the Commission decides otherwise, we recommend that any additional reporting be in a no more than two-year pilot program that we would be prepared to work with the Commission to design with a limited number of commodities.” The resulting “COT-Supplemental” report consists of just twelve markets and its two-year mandate expires at the end of this year.</p>
<p>More enlightening than the swap dealers wish for anonymity, was the reason stated in the ISDA’s letter to the CFTC: “the [swap dealer] category is highly concentrated, with, we believe, the top four swap dealers composing over 70% of the category. In some of the lower-volume commodities markets, only a single swap dealer is a dominant participant”.</p></blockquote>
<p>With one to four unregulated swap dealers controlling upward of 60% of the long open interest in some markets, the CFTC’s has created a nightmarish level of concentration. Even assuming that their dealings in fact originate from non-leveraged investors, sudden setbacks in other investment areas could easily jeopardize a swap dealer’s ability to meet margin calls, al la Bear Stearns.<br />Complete at <a href="http://commitmentsoftraders.org/?p=28">Commitments of Traders</a>.</p>

                                <p>1. The stories about the problem of mechanical-dial fuel pumps being unable to register prices over $3.999/gallon make me wonder, why can&#8217;t the stations needing to charge $4 or more simply ignore the reported purchase amount and calculate the correct amount of the sale from the quantity and the actual price?  The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/15/AR2008051503756.html">obstacle</a> seems to be one of weights and measures regulations rather than a technically workable solution being costly. (According to the WaPo story, a station got into trouble with the State of Virginia for setting a pump to the half-gallon price and adjusting the sale at the register, which certainly could be confusing in the absence of very clear signage.)</p>
<p>Note that the pump need only accurately register the quantity, not the price, to enable correct computation of the sale amount.  Thus, the technical solution can be implemented for approximately $0: the price of an opaque barrier to cover the price display and a basic pocket calculator, versus the $30,000 figure sometimes quoted for new pumps with digital readouts. It may not be the apotheosis of convenience — e.g. for people trying to fill up to a dollar amount, though I can think of cheap solutions there too — but stations with the old pumps probably aren&#8217;t selling the &#8220;conveniences&#8221; of the modern automated filling station.  The regulatory barrier is not necessarily expensive to overcome, relative to the cost of retrofitting thousands of low-volume pumps (mostly in locations remote from other stations).  So the economic story is more in the &#8220;who&#8217;d&#8217;a thunk&#8221; department than anything else.</p>
<p>2. A while back at the old blog, I&#8217;d contemplated some of the members of the crack (smoking) McCain economic team and <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/03/does-anyone-really-believe-this.html">asked</a>, &#8220;Who&#8217;s next, Donald Luskin?&#8221;  Well, <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784">life evidently imitates parody</a> yet again, as <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OliverWillisLikeKryptoniteToStupid/~3/292675981/">Oliver Willis</a> reads the <a href="http://cunningrealist.blogspot.com/2008/05/yeah-that-worked-out-well.html">Cunning Realist</a> who finds Luskin calling himself an &#8220;<a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/ahead-of-the-curve/index.cfm?story=20080208-futures-bet-on-obama">unpaid economic advisor</a>&#8221; to the McCain campaign.  Doesn&#8217;t an equation of marginal benefits and marginal costs require Luskin to pay McCain to take his advice?  (As necessary, go to the Great Gazoogle and enter the search term &#8216;Luskin &#8220;stupidest man alive&#8221; site:delong.typepad.com&#8217;.)</p>
<p>3.  Philadelphia International Airport&#8217;s shabby Terminal E still isn&#8217;t anyplace I&#8217;d want to be forced into an extended stay, but hooray for PHL for offering quasi-free WiFi.  (I say quasi-free in that the terms-and-conditions page effectively serves as an ad for wireless service provider AT&#038;T.)  Spoke airports — notably excepting my <a href="http://www.msnairport.com/">home base</a> — have mostly gotten the clue that free wireless makes passengers happy, but hubs are still mostly on pay networks.  Though the ad-supported wireless at Denver worked pretty well, too.  By comparison, I don&#8217;t seem to be able to visit non-free Detroit or Minneapolis without finding dead spots and bum routers.  I wonder if the quasi-free services actually offer better service since, in contrast to subscriber-supported services, they&#8217;re sure not to pay off (one way or another) if they can&#8217;t make connections.</p>
<p>4. I got to see quite the 35-mph non-offset frontal crash into a deformable barrier the other day,  the barrier in question being a red-light-running pickup truck T-boned by a late-model Acura TSX (a/k/a Honda Accord in Europe and Japan).  Let&#8217;s just say that it was an excellent safety advertisement for Honda in that the car&#8217;s front end was demolished but the driver walked away merely a little dazed from the airbag detonation.  In the pickup was a very sick infant on the way to the A.I. du Pont Children&#8217;s Hospital in Wilmington, Delaware, which fortunately was only a couple blocks from the crash site; the poor kid&#8217;s understandably distraught dad was playing ambulance and ran out of luck.  PSA: Very Bad Idea.  If you need to get to the hospital that fast, call a real ambulance.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Dr. John F. Gaski, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Notre Dame, has <a href="http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008805180336">an opinion piece</a> in today&#8217;s Indy Star on the &#8220;causes&#8221; high gas prices. He boils it down to several causes, summarized below:
<ol>
<li>Legal restrictions on refinery construction and rehabilitation</li>
<li>Legal restrictions on drilling in off-shore areas</li>
<li>Legal restrictions on drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge</li>
<li>Legal restrictions on nuclear power plant construction</li>
<li>Strategic errors of the Federal Reserve that has allowed the collapse of the dollar</li>
<li>Legal restrictions requiring refiners to use &#8220;boutique&#8221; blends of gasoline to protect the environment</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice five of the six reasons Gaski cites various forms of &#8220;legal restrictions&#8221;. Thus government is to blame. But not just any kind of government:<br />
<blockquote>Note that all the cited policy mistakes are those of one political camp. For decades the liberal Democrats have done everything they could to raise domestic oil and gasoline prices, and now that those higher prices have come home to roost, the Democrats pretend not to like them. Currently, their anti-oil industry propaganda campaign is on track to create the abysmal public ignorance that is a precondition for the same base level of public policy, and policy outcomes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gaski blames &#8220;liberal&#8221; Democrats for our current gasoline woes; in fact, that seems to be the entire point of Gaski&#8217;s piece. This is especially ironic given that the GOP has controlled the House of Representatives for 12 of the last 13 years, the Senate for 4 of the last 5 years, and the Executive branch for the last 7. They&#8217;re the ones who have been at the helm. In addition, most of these regulations have been in place for decades, yet the price of gasoline (and oil) have skyrocketed only recently.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather not engage in partisan sniping, however, despite the fact that partisan sniping is exactly what Gaski intended. Instead, I was especially interested in this portion:<br />
<blockquote>[W]hat do you think the oil company&#8217;s profit is? (Assume an integrated major oil company that even owns the filling station, so we don&#8217;t have to separate producer, refiner and retailer profit. That is, we identify profit for the whole oil/gasoline industry out of the purchase price.) Would Big Oil make a profit of 60 cents, 70 cents, $1, $1.50?
<p>No. Try 25 cents.</p>
<p>That is correct. With an industry-wide average net profit margin on the retail sale price of about 8 percent, the net profit on your gallon of gas is about a quarter, give or take a penny or two depending on the size of the oil company. (About 3 cents net goes to an independently owned station, leaving 22 cents for Big Oil, but the total is still a quarter.)</p>
<p>An accurate understanding of oil industry profit levels dramatizes that it is misguided to accuse the oil industry of price gouging. Beyond the cited 8 percent profit on sales, the industry&#8217;s return on investment is right at the average across all of American industry &#8212; about 25 percent. And these profit indices were much lower during the recent lean years in the oil business.</p>
<p>What of ExxonMobil&#8217;s &#8220;obscene&#8221; $40 billion total profit last year? Isn&#8217;t it natural for the largest corporation to earn the largest profit? Anything other than that would be a major upset. Moreover, record profits year after year are the natural order of things in business, reflecting normal growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gaski claims &#8220;Big Oil&#8221; only makes $0.25 per gallon of gas. He cites this fact as evidence that Big Oil isn&#8217;t engaging in price gouging.</p>
<p>One measly quarter per gallon of gas, especially since a gallon of gas now costs about $4.oo per gallon, seems like very little. But that $0.25 per gallon figure doesn&#8217;t tell you much in isolation. So I decided to see how oil industry profit has changed in relationship to gasoline consumption over time.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know where Gaski gets his $0.25 figure from. I assume that&#8217;s what the average profit Big Oil makes from a gallon of gas in the US, given the context of Gaski&#8217;s comments. I don&#8217;t know where I can find statistics on how much Big Oil has made in just the US, given that the companies that make up Big Oil are giant multinational corporations that have global reach. So I decided to square apples with apples as best I could.</p>
<p>I calculated world gasoline consumption using <a href="http://www.investis.com/bp_acc_ia/stat_review_06/htdocs/reports/report_19.html">data from BP</a>. They list consumption in tonnes of oil equivalent (toe), so I converted that to gallons (US) using <a href="http://www.spe.org/spe-app/spe/industry/reference/unit_conversions.htm">this website</a>. Next, I tried to find a website that lists annual profits of the oil industry the last few years. Unfortunately, I could only find <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2008/02/high_oil.html">this one</a> that goes back to 2001. (If anyone knows another place to find these data, especially if it goes back earlier than 2001, I&#8217;d appreciate it).</p>
<p>Here is a figure illustrating worldwide gasoline consumption and oil industry profits from 2001 to 2006:<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SDC6echwY7I/AAAAAAAAAJk/UPoLODB1NJA/s1600-h/gas_profit.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SDC6echwY7I/AAAAAAAAAJk/UPoLODB1NJA/s400/gas_profit.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>I calculated the profit in dollars per gallon consumed by just dividing the two. Here is that figure:<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SDC63MhwY8I/AAAAAAAAAJs/HnQlUOuLSlM/s1600-h/dollar_per_gallon.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SDC63MhwY8I/AAAAAAAAAJs/HnQlUOuLSlM/s400/dollar_per_gallon.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>This assumes a couple of things. First, all of the industry profits are directly tied to gallons consumed. We know this is not true, because not all oil is converted into gasoline. Nevertheless, I ended up calculating that profit per gallon worldwide is much less than the $0.25 per gallon that Gaski reports. But the point of all of this is how these values have changed over time. I calculated the percent change in these three values relative to 2001:<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SDC77shwY9I/AAAAAAAAAJ0/D5fSHldLiJs/s1600-h/gas_percent.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SDC77shwY9I/AAAAAAAAAJ0/D5fSHldLiJs/s400/gas_percent.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>As you can see, industry profits and profit per gallon consumed have increased enormously the past few years relative to gas consumption. Gas consumption was 16% higher in 2006 than it was in 2001. Industry profits, on the other hand, were 190% higher in 2006 than in 2001.</p>
<p>It is clear the the profits of Big Oil have grown much faster than gasoline consumption the past few years. Perhaps the profit accrued by Big Oil over the past few years do not come from gasoline sales but from other revenue streams. I doubt it, though.</p>
<p>Does this mean Big Oil is participating in some grand conspiracy of collusion to drive prices higher? Of course not; I think it&#8217;s pretty clear that the increase in price of gas and oil is the result of increased demand, however small, with no increase in supply given that we are at capacity supply right now. Nevertheless, the data strongly suggest that the profit pocketed by Big Oil per gallon of gasoline consumed is increasing, something that runs contrary to what was suggested by Gaski in his piece.</p>

In my defense a commenter back in April suggested publishing it on Angry Bear, at the time I didn&#8217;t have posting privileges.<br />People who follow Social Security issues understand that in addition to the Intermediate Cost Alternative whose dates and numbers are universally reported in the press that the Trustees also present two other models called Low Cost and High Cost. Low Cost is typically depicted as being more &#8216;optimistic&#8217; while High Cost being more &#8216;pessimistic&#8217;. But that depends on your perspective. In reality Low Cost is better depicted as &#8216;hotter&#8217; in economic terms and High Cost as &#8216;cooler&#8217;. Now for most purposes the a relatively hotter economy than current Intermediate Cost assumes would be a good thing, all kinds of things are possible given higher levels of productivity and GDP, but for the specific purposes of Social Security it is possible that you can get too much of a good thing.
<div></div>
<div>Whether a &#8216;crisis&#8217; that comes in the form of a benefit cut in 2041 is really one depends on your perspective. Under current law and projections the General Fund will be under a modest but real strain in the late 2030s as the Trust Fund is finally redeemed. But given that there is no legal obligation to actually backfill that benefit cut, the economic result of doing Nothing in 2041 would be a fairly large tax cut for 2042. Note that this assumes Intermediate Cost results.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But what happens under Low Cost? Well until the 2007 Report the Low Cost alternative always returned the same result: fully funded Social Security with flat Trust Fund ratio (reserves expressed as a function of time). While at first glance this seems like an ideal outcome a look at the numbers reveals a little different story.</div>
<div><a href="http://www.blogger.com/%3Cspan%20class=" face="'Trebuchet MS'" size="13px"></a><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR07/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#wp150920">2007 Report: Trust Fund Operations 2007-2085</a></div>
<div>Under 2007 Low Cost Income excluding Interest continues to exceed cost until 2023 at which time a portion of the interest accrued needs to be tapped. The amount needed never exceeds more than about a fourth of the actual interest earned and doesn&#8217;t amount to a whole lot once you adjust the total for inflation, in constant dollars it works out to about $120 billion a year. But it never stops. Generation after generation ends up paying interest on a debt piled up by people paying excess taxes from 1983 to 2023 even after all utility of that borrowing has been exhausted and the people who paid in the actual extra dollars have all moved on. This isn&#8217;t a terrible outcome but it does hack away at the fundamental strength of Social Security as a worker funded insurance plan for workers, under 2007 Low Cost the General Fund subsidy, though certainly legally obligated, starts making it take on aspects of a welfare system.</div>
<div></div>
<div>With the 2008 Report we entered into a whole new world. Rather than Low Cost showing an outcome with a Trust Fund ratio in equilibrium we have Outcome I in the figure at the top of the post, a Trust Fund ratio that bottoms out around 2040 and then accelerates upwards after about 2060. This is a bad outcome. If the assets in the Trust Fund are real, and they are legal obligations, why should workers continue to pay into a system with trillions of dollars of accumulated surpluses? But flattening out that tail becomes more and more difficult, the only way to do it is to slash away at FICA taxes so that enough interest has to be drawn from the Trust Fund to get it back to equilibrium. The mathematical result is that the balance between Income and Interest in relation to Cost starts skewing. At an extreme a Trust Fund Ratio of 2000 with an assumed interest rate of 5% can only go to equilibrium by paying 100% of benefits from the General Fund in the form of Interest (5% of 2000 = 100% of Cost). At a Ratio of 1000 you end up at the crossing point where fully half of Social Security is being paid out of the General Fund by taxpayers that never benefited directly from the early 21st century borrowing to start with. Operationally Social Security starts looking like just another Federally funded social program, in a word welfare.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What is the solution? Well first we need to have a plan to flatten the tail of Low Cost, perhaps combined with some reexamination of what the long term Trust Fund Ratio should be. Under the law the Trustees are mandated to maintain a Trust Fund Ratio of at least 100 and that seems to be a reasonable target, that would deliver a total system where 95% of benefits are being paid from payroll tax and 5% by transfers to pay the accruing interest. And it would be nice to have as a goal meeting the benefit levels of the current schedule. Which is why I want to call this the 100/100 Plan. 100% of scheduled benefits and a Trust Fund with a consistent 100 TF Ratio.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Making this happen requires changing our conceptual Social Security model from one of projections to one of explicit targeting. First we need to provide a Baby Bear model, which is to say that combination of growth outcomes and taxation adjustments needed to achieve 100/100 equilibrium and then pair that with a truly median economic and demographic projection (because Intermediate Cost is not cutting it). If the actual economy performs better than Baby Bear in the current year than you calibrate the tax adjustment down, if the actual economy under performs Baby Bear you set the future adjustment up. If we put the actual adjustment on a schedule with minimal political influence, say in the third year of every Presidential term, you would end up with a system of minor tweaks starting in 2011.</div>
<div></div>
<div>My bet is that the first tweak would likely be a relatively small cut in FICA, but with an extended recession it might be a somewhat larger boost but in any event in the range of plus/minus .2% of payroll. But in any event we need to plan for outcomes enough better than Intermediate Cost to risk the runaway Trust Fund we see under Low Cost.</div>

<p>For those more conversant in the &#8220;disincentives of enforcement&#8221; literature than I, can you back into the Rational Expectation of Enforcement Practices that would lead nearly 14% of a population to conclude it is maximizing utility?</p>
<p>And, given your calculation, what would that say about the Management Practices of the organization?</p>

<p>He blames it on Australian competition.</p>

<p>Does he really have such a low opinion of the readers of his blog that believes he can get away with stuff like this?</p>
