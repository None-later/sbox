                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I don&#8217;t see how it can happen with GW in charge, but let&#8217;s say he pulls out a victory in Iraq.</p>
<p>So what does victory look like? MY guess&#8230; best case scenario, at the end of another five or six years of fighting, our allies impose an Islamic theocracy on Iraq. (Or multiple Islamic theocracies of a few different flavors, as has happened in a number of regions in Afghanistan outside Kabhul.) Most of the population is too cowed to say anything and lives in fear. One region of the country is openly more-or-less allied with Iran, another looks something like Pakistan. And just like Pakistan, a very large percentage of the population is openly anti-American, with the remainder being at best indifferent to Americans. Also like Pakistan, the country continues to export instability to the rest of the region.</p>
<p>Its not an unreasonable assumption&#8230; the elements that have been gaining power are religious (Shiites like al Sadr, the Sunni sheikhs in al Anbar that are so conspicuously fighting Al Qaeda), and none are the kind of folks that wouldn&#8217;t happily slit the throat of any American if they thought they could get away with it. </p>
<p>Am I wrong? Is this outcome less likely than a flowering of a pro-Western democracy that leads to peace and prosperity throughout the Middle East? And if I&#8217;m not wrong&#8230; then what? Will such an outcome have been worth it? Will it be worse than the alternative that is likely if there is a pull-out? And where do we go from there?</p>

                                <p>This post is on spending on education by administration.  Its a follow-up to a post I wrote yesterday on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-is-our-children.html">enrollment in school</a>.  </p>
<p>Data comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist03z2.xls">OMB Table 3.2</a>, and I’m using spending on elementary, secondary, vocational, and higher education, along with spending on research and general education aids, all as a percentage of the total federal spending.</p>
<p>So here’s what it looks like.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpTB6Tb6ORI/AAAAAAAAAaI/-hBM0LPao2w/s1600-h/Fed+Budget+on+Education+Graph.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpTB6Tb6ORI/AAAAAAAAAaI/-hBM0LPao2w/s320/Fed+Budget+on+Education+Graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>A summary.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpTB1Db6OQI/AAAAAAAAAaA/_y7v-O7Mv9c/s1600-h/Fed+Budget+on+Education+Table.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpTB1Db6OQI/AAAAAAAAAaA/_y7v-O7Mv9c/s320/Fed+Budget+on+Education+Table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Spending figures may go some way toward explaining the big increases in educational enrollment under JFK/LBJ shown in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-is-our-children.html">in my earlier post on education enrollment</a>.  There were also increases under GW, but he was more middle of the pack despite the big increases in spending in his administration so far.  Now, it may go some way toward excusing him, but considering enrollment was above 90% for the 14 to 17 year olds, there wasn’t much further upside.  Except, of course, that with people picked by Rod Paige counting the numbers, who believes them?  On the plus side, all that spending has  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Bush">attracted some of the finest minds</a> into the industry, so no doubt there really is some progress of some kind.  It’s a welcome change to see that W getting some results after a huge amount of spending.</p>
<p>Some correlations&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpTBvTb6OPI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/wDGG4M4n1Bw/s1600-h/Fed+Budget+on+Education+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpTBvTb6OPI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/wDGG4M4n1Bw/s320/Fed+Budget+on+Education+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>It isn’t much, but it does seem like a spending increase in one year leads to a bit of an increase in enrollment in the next year (14 – 17 year olds) or the year after (20 – 24 year olds), though these correlations aren’t strong.  And the more people enrolling in college, the greater the increase in federal spending the next year.  I assume part of the difference is that a lot of the funding comes from state and local sources.</p>

                                <p>Now that I&#8217;m married, its time to act kinda responsibly. So its time to get new living wills, powers of attorney, etc.</p>
<p>Most of these forms are available online. As to the trust&#8230; I can&#8217;t find copies online, but I have an old trust form I paid for some years back &#8211; hard copy only. Its now outdated&#8230; it comes from the time before I met the Ex-GF. I don&#8217;t feel like paying for it to be updated, and besides, I&#8217;d like to have a soft copy so I could make more changes as my life changes further without having to go to an attorney every time. So I&#8217;m starting to type up the trust form myself. </p>
<p>Its boring but educational. And confusing. People always say you need a trust rather than a will to avoid probate. But if I understand things correctly, you still need a will. And the will turns everything over to the trust. And then the trust turns everything over to the beneficiary. Is this right? What kind of convoluted nonsense is this?</p>
<p>Anyone care to explain what is going on in comments. I bet I&#8217;m not the only one confused.</p>

                                <p>Over the past few years, Atrios has been documenting the Friedmans; every few days he has a link to something said by someone in the administration, a congresscritter, or a cheerleader about how it is necessary to give the current situation in Iraq another six months. In each case, the quote is from six months earlier, and he&#8217;s been doing this for years, and some of the same characters crop up again and again and again. </p>
<p>Apparently, this week there&#8217;s a bumper crop&#8230; <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/escalation-list/">Think Progress</a> got into the act put together a list of some of them all in one place. <a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/">Atrios</a> has even more scattered throughout various posts today.</p>
<p>And now that another Friedman has come and gone, so what?  Well, we need another Friedman, or three.  At which point we&#8217;ll need another.  This is how the Hundred Years War became the Hundred Years War.</p>

                                <p><strong>George Will Blames FDR for the Continuation of the Great Depression</strong></p>

<p>Nobel Prize Winning Economist (NOT) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/06/AR2007070601927.html">George Will</a> dusts off an old favorite from the rightwing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some mornings during the autumn of 1933, when the unemployment rate was 22 percent, the president, before getting into his wheelchair, sat in bed, surrounded by economic advisers, setting the price of gold. One morning he said he might raise it 21 cents: &#8220;It&#8217;s a lucky number because it&#8217;s three times seven.&#8221; His Treasury secretary wrote that if people knew how gold was priced &#8220;they would be frightened.&#8221;  The Depression&#8217;s persistence, partly a result of such policy flippancy, was frightening…. This transformation was actually assisted by the misguided policies &#8211; including government-created uncertainties that paralyzed investors &#8211; that prolonged the Depression.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Will seems to be in love with <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780066211701/The_Forgotten_Man/index.aspx">The Forgotten Man</a> by Amity Shlaes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shlaes also traces the mounting agony of the New Dealers themselves as they discovered their errors. She shows how both Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt failed to understand the prosperity of the 1920s and heaped massive burdens on the country that more than offset the benefit of New Deal programs. The real question about the Depression, she argues, is not whether Roosevelt ended it with World War II. It is why the Depression lasted so long. From 1929 to 1940, federal intervention helped to make the Depression great &#8211; in part by forgetting the men and women who sought to help one another.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess you would not be surprised to learn that Ms. Shlaes used to write op-eds for the Wall Street Journal.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Forgotten-Man-History-Great-Depression/dp/0066211700">Amazon</a> provides an interesting review of her new book:</p>
<blockquote><p>This breezy narrative comes from the pen of a veteran journalist and economics reporter. Rather than telling a new story, she tells an old one (scarcely lacking for historians) in a fresh way. Shlaes brings to the tale an emphasis on economic realities and consequences, especially when seen from the perspective of monetarist theory, and a focus on particular individuals and events, both celebrated and forgotten (at least relatively so).</p></blockquote>
<p>Her tale seems to be a very old story indeed.  But back to Mr. Will who focused not on monetary policy but on the increase in government spending:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before Roosevelt, the federal government was unimpressive relative to the private sector. Under Calvin Coolidge, the last pre-Depression president, its revenue averaged 4 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 18.6 percent today. In 1910, Congress legislated height limits for Washington buildings, limits that prevented skyscrapers, symbols of mighty business, from overshadowing the Capitol, the symbol of government.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where to start?  Let’s give the microphone over to <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_07/011658.php">Kevin Drum</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dude: That was 74 years ago. What&#8217;s more, there was even a reason for it. Roosevelt scholars should feel free to jump in and correct me if I get this wrong, but my recollection is that FDR wanted to raise the price of gold as a way of inducing inflation — a policy that, correct or not in hindsight, was certainly defensible given the farm crisis he was dealing with at the time — but that he wanted the price to rise gradually and erratically so that speculators couldn&#8217;t take advantage of predictable movements. Lots of people were appalled by Roosevelt&#8217;s apparent casualness about the gold price, but as usual, there was method to his madness. I, for one, am glad that he was president in 1933 and not George Will.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep – the debt deflation theory that economist bloggers debated about six months ago.  We mentioned it <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/does-deflation-increase-aggregate.html">here</a> with links to a few other posts and readings that George Will apparently cannot follow. </p>
<p>On the size of the government, Will wants to compare Federal revenues under Coolidge to what we are seeing today without admitting to his readers that Federal transfer payments today are higher than they were under FDR.  But why don’t we look instead at total government purchases in 1929 (first year of recorded data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis), which was almost 14% of GDP as compared to the somewhat higher level under FDR today or today.  But hey – we have a larger defense establishment today than we did in 1929.  Is Mr. Will advocating we get rid of the Pentagon?  </p>
<p>As we noted earlier in the year, investment demand does not appear to be spooked by FDR’s Administration.  But just in case Mr. Will needs a picture – he can check out our graph of investment demand (2000$) from 1929 to 1940, which is taken from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">this source</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDFlOGU5OGFhOWE2MTFlZTA4Njg5ODJmZWNiN2ZhMjM=&#038;w=MQ==">KLo</a> interviews Amity Shlaes and asks her about the books she relied upon when writing her own book on the Great Depression.  Not mentioned were Friedman and Schwartz’s A Monetary History of the United States of Charles Kindleberger’s The World in Depression, The General Theory by Lord Keynes, or even Schumpeter’s Business Cycles: A Theoretical, Historical, and Statistical Analysis of the Capitalist Process.  No mention of any of the academic publications on this period either.  No – her main reference seems to have been FDR’s Folly by Jim Powell.  While it may be the perfect book for the wingnuts, I’m not rushing out to purchase it myself.</p>

                                <p>This post is on education, specifically the percentage of 14 to 17 year olds enrolled in school, and the percentage of 20 to 24 year olds enrolled in school. The former group gives some indication of whether students are finishing high school, the latter whether they go on to college. </p>
<p>Before we go any further, let’s note that there are several ways a President can affect these figures. One is by providing funding for schools and loans to students. Another is to try to encourage the development of those parts of the economy for which education really pays off. The President can also set an example… an inarticulate and frequently confused President gives the impression that education isn’t important for success. Interestingly enough, a booming economy might actually reduce high school graduation or college enrollment – potential students might choose to take the opportunity to do some earning while the earning is good. Conversely, a recession often means more people in college. (Or at least that’s been the case in recent decades.) The numbers can also be affected, and even improved simply by <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/06/60II/main591676.shtml">careful selection of one’s Secretary Education</a>.</p>
<p>OK. So… data comes from <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d05/tables/xls/tabn007.xls">here</a>. </p>
<p>A couple graphs&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have a post on spending on education soon, and I haven&#8217;t done any more than take a cursory glance at the figures, but by far the biggest jump in spending on education as a share of the Federal budget (data goes back only to 1962, so figures for Ike and much of JFK&#8217;s term is not there) occurred under JFK/LBJ. My bet is this was a big priority for Ike too. Right after WW2 (thus, encompassing Truman as well), education was important on its own (think GI bill) but also as a way to further Civil Rights.</p>
<p>And now a question&#8230; why does it matter? Does it matter? </p>

<p>Normally, at this point I&#8217;d discuss what I think is going on. But I&#8217;m kinda in a rush right now&#8230; so have at it.</p>

<blockquote><p>A progress report on Iraq will conclude that the U.S.-backed government in Baghdad has not met any of its targets for political, economic and other reform, speeding up the Bush administration&#8217;s reckoning on what to do next, a U.S. official said Monday.</p>
<p>One likely result of the report will be a vastly accelerated debate among President Bush&#8217;s top aides on withdrawing troops and scaling back the U.S. presence in Iraq.</p>
<p>The &#8220;pivot point&#8221; for addressing the matter will no longer be Sept. 15, as initially envisioned, when a full report on Bush&#8217;s so-called &#8220;surge&#8221; plan is due, but instead will come this week when the interim mid-July assessment is released, the official said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The facts are not in question,&#8221; the official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because the draft is still under discussion. &#8220;The real question is how the White House proceeds with a post-surge strategy in light of the report.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I won&#8217;t bother linking to my various predictions, before the Surge began, that it was going to fail.  I will repeat my reason&#8230; this administration, and its cheerleaders and enablers, got their way on everything.  They tried everything they wanted to try, all the while calling naysayers and doubters every name in the book.  And yet, they screwed up on every big ticket thing they have tried.  They are simply incompetent.  </p>
<p>Which means they will fail again.  Plan M or W or Phi Zappa Krappa or whatever we&#8217;re up to now can be anything.  If by some random chance they stumble upon the greatest military plan in history, they will still fail.  Because as bad as they are at planning, they are worse at execution.  And this has been obvious for a very long time.  Perhaps not to the writers and some of the readers of a lot of right wing blogs, but to most of the country.  </p>
<p>As long as these people are in charge, anything they do is doomed is failure.  They talk and promise and grin and smile and look serious, but they deliver nothing but failure.  And the longer they continue doing what they are doing, the deeper the hole from which the next President will have to claw us (and the Iraqis) out.  And the more lives they will cost.</p>

                                <p>Senator Clinton: Marxist or the Return of Robert Rubin?</p>
<p>Let’s start with what Senator Clinton <a href="http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/speech/view/?id=1839">actually said</a> back on May 29.  There are a lot of great lines under this title of Modern Progressive Vision: Shared Prosperity but the passage that is catching folks attention is:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few and for the few, time to reject the idea of an &#8220;on your own&#8221; society and to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity. I prefer a &#8220;we&#8217;re all in it together&#8221; society. Now, there is no greater force for economic growth than free markets, but markets work best with rules that promote our values, protect our workers and give all people a chance to succeed.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2007/jul/09/romney_hillary_clinton_has_marxist_platform">T. W. Farnam</a> catches Mitt Romney distorting what Senator Clinton said so he can call her a Marxist.  This reminds me of the standard Don Marek comment around this place.  I suspect <a href="http://www.maxspeak.org/mt/archives.html">Max Sawicky</a> sees this speech as a movement to the right of what he was hoping for.  One of Max’s readers points to <a href="http://davidsirota.com/index.php/2007/07/04/who-is-corporate-americas-2008-candidate">David Sirota</a> suggesting the Senator is the Democratic version of the K Street candidate.  If you are not confused enough already, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/bad-news-clinto.html">Brad DeLong</a> laments a protectionist tone from the Senator.  </p>
<p>I sort of like the progressive position the Senator staked out on May 29 but even this supposedly Marxist bear is saddened to see the protectionist tone that Brad brings our attention to.  But did we have a clue back on May 29.  Let’s review what the Senator said on China:</p>
<blockquote><p>because India and China have begun to harness the power of technology, they are on their way to becoming economic super powers.  Like it or not, that is the reality of globalization. And it isn&#8217;t going away. However, if managed properly, globalization may offer the promise of new markets, new growth, and new opportunities for broadly shared prosperity to young people like Colleen. Unfortunately, we&#8217;re not managing globalization properly. Instead of working for all of us, globalization is working only for a few of us &#8230; You know, people ask me all the time, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t we get tough on China?&#8221; Well, the answer is, because China is one of our bankers. We&#8217;re their debtor. How can we truly enforce trade laws against a country that manipulates it currency and puts us at an unfair advantage when our economic stability depends on China&#8217;s massive loans to us every single day?</p></blockquote>
<p>This didn’t sound very protectionist back then.  Let’s hope she avoids future calls for trade protection.  But hey – I’m a ProGrowth “Marxist”.</p>

                                <p>Tax Policy Advice That We Should Ignore</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hale-stewart/how-democrats-should-talk_b_55303.html">Hale “Bonddad” Stewart</a> argues that we Democrats should become free lunch supply-siders if we wish to see more national savings:</p>
<blockquote><p>So savings &#8211; most notably for retirement &#8211; should receive a tax advantaged rate to encourage savings. Retirement plans already grow at a tax deferred rate, meaning they are already sheltered from taxes. However, the current capital gains structure put in place does not provide a strong enough incentive to induce additional savings as evidenced by the low national savings rate. Therefore, some additional policy initiatives appear to be needed.  First, a return for a preferential capital gains rate for longer-term investments is in order. This jibes with the section above that discussed trading gains.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn’t this sort of like George W. Bush’s “give people their money back so they can consume more” nonsense.  I have never heard of Bonddad Stewart but apparently <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/003172.html">Max Sawicky</a> knows him:</p>
<blockquote><p>You increase the rate of return to saving, you get more saving, right? Because all good economists know that prices and incentives are rilly important, right? Wrong! Savings is also about the budget deficit and trade policy. Capital tax cuts and increased deficits means lower national savings</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly right! So let’s say this slowly so Bonddad can follow.  An inward shift of the national savings schedule tends to raise the cost of capital, which in turn tends to lower investment.  It’s bad enough when rightwingers get this issue all wrong – but now we hearing this nonsense from the left as well?  Incentive effects do exist but Bonddad – like his fellow rightwing free lunchers – are not proposing a fiscally neutral means for encouraging more private capital formation.   Or maybe he wants to cut public investment to pay for my private investment?  Banging my head against the wall!</p>

                                <p>I had the most unsettling dreams last night. They were so vivid, and in color. I&#8217;ve been out of work too long. It&#8217;s been a couple years now. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the matter with me, but I just can&#8217;t seem to find work. Arlene down the street has two jobs and yet has no where near the education and experience I have. True, her jobs hardly pay anything, but at least she&#8217;s working.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in the papers, government reports, on TV— the economy is good and job creation is robust. We may experience a few ups and downs, but overall the economy is growing, the stock market keeps going up, inflation is under control, and employers have trouble finding people. What&#8217;s the matter with me?</p>
<p>Those dreams! I dreamt of charts that seemed to put the lie to what I see on TV and read in the newspapers. The charts show that job creation has been lousy, that compared to where we could be, we&#8217;re way off. I dreamt that lack of opportunity affects 10 to 12 million people who want to work, and I was one of them. Here&#8217;s an example chart from last night’s dreams:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/RpJIQSRUReI/AAAAAAAAABM/uWT-D0__16E/s1600-h/JPT_93m1_07m6A.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/RpJIQSRUReI/AAAAAAAAABM/uWT-D0__16E/s400/JPT_93m1_07m6A.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Putting job creation in terms of population growth, the chart shows our country is nowhere near its potential. It turns out the average Democratic Job Creation Index is consistently higher than the Republican average. Based on the Democratic average, last month might have seen 280,000 net jobs created, not 132,000. Another chart I saw in my dreams gave the 60-year overall JCI average as 1.02. So just average or mediocre job growth would have produced 190,000 jobs in June instead of 132,000. That doesn’t fit with the happy talk about the June report, or previous reports. I dreamt I can&#8217;t find work because there’s less opportunity.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just my subconscious playing tricks, trying to make me feel better. It’s everywhere in the media: Times are good. If one or two reporters or economists were saying it…but when almost all those knowledgeable people say that things are good, that we’re experiencing a Goldilocks economy, you’d think it’s so. Still, the dreams and charts are disturbing. It&#8217;s more than I can take right now. I need to clear my head. Maybe Fox TV is showing something on Paris Hilton. She&#8217;s a hottie.</p>
