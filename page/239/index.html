<blockquote><p>Jordan&#8217;s Royal Palace says the king has sacked his government in the wake of street protests and has asked an ex-army general to form a new Cabinet. </p>
<p>King Abdullah&#8217;s move comes after thousands of Jordanians took to the streets — inspired by the regime ouster in Tunisia and the turmoil in Egypt — and called for the resignation of Prime Minister Samir Rifai who is blamed for a rise in fuel and <a target="_blank" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/food_prices/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">food prices</a> and slowed political reforms. </p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2011/01/whither-egypt.html">Barkley Rosser</a> offers a take off point for the international aspects of the Egyptian turmoil, and a <a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2011/01/political-economic-basis-of-egyptian.html">beginning look</a> at the history of the politics/economics of the nation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday, Juan Cole posted on  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.juancole.com/2011/01/egypts-class-conflict.html">Class Conflict in Egypt</a>. As usual, very insightful on the poltical economic foundations of this uprising. He argues that the original base of support for the Nasserist regime that took over in a coup in 1952 was rural land reform, with the rural middle class that got land still the base of the regime. However, over time with urbanization and slow growth and the rise of corruption since Mubarak took over, that base has eroded. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Nasser also gained credibility for throwing out the British and standing up to other outsiders (with the US and Soviets ironically siding with him in the 1956 Suez Crisis against the UK, France, and Israel).</p>
<p>Real wages doubled between 1960 and 1970, when Nasser died, but stagnated after that until 2000, with nearly zero real per capita income growth and a worsening income distribution. Neo-liberal policies, including relaxation of food price controls in the 1990s, did not produce much, although growth did increase after 2000, running at a 5-6% rate. But it has not been enough to provide jobs for the many urban youth, particularly the better educated ones.</p>
<p>Also, since 1980 the regime has been seen as supported by outsiders, particularly the US, Israel, Britain, and France, in contrast to the Nasser period. As economic problems surged with the food price spikes in 2008 and the subsequent Great Recession in the world economy, this made for a weak foundation of support for the regime. We should expect any successor to take a more independent line, especially the moderate El-Baradei who was so badly treated by the US previously. </p>
<p>I must note, however, that while inequality has increased, it is not all that bad compared to many other countries, with Egypt&#8217;s current Gini coefficient of 34.0 putting it in 90th place in terms of inequality in the world.</p>
<p>Finally, I note that the chances for Mohamed El-Baradei succeeding Mubarak (eventually anyway) have increased with him receiving the support of the Ikhwan, the Muslim Brotherhood. However, there are other more radical Islamist groups in Egypt calling for an Islamist state with Shari&#8217;a imposed as law, although they appear to be a minority on that side, even though they are more moderate than the expelled Egyptian Islamic Jihad, whose leaders include the #2 and #3 figures in al-Qaeda.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Their Promised Approach to Governance Didn’t Work Out So Well for the Last Guys     <br /></strong>    <br />During one of their debates, Nevada Tea Party Senatorial candidate Sharon Angle famously told Majority Leader Harry Reid to “Man up!” meaning he needed to toughen up in the face of adversity and take responsibility for his actions and their consequences. As it turned out, Reid apparently manned up sufficiently to become one of the relatively few Democrats avoiding rejection by voters last Tuesday.    <br />Republicans, the big winners in this election, were quick to see their victory as a justification to mandate up. Their victory moved Representative John Boehner of Ohio, the likely next Speaker of the House, to tears of relief because he believed his Party now could save the American Dream. “I think that it&#8217;s a mandate for Washington to reduce the size of government and continue our fight for smaller, less costly and more accountable government,” he told reporters.</p>

<p><em>John Boehner and Mitch McConnell believe they have</em>    <br /><em>been given a mandate to undo Obamacare and Obama</em></p>
<p>Boehner also believes Republicans have a mandate to repeal healthcare reform as passed by Democrats, calling it a “monstrosity” that “will kill jobs in America, ruin the best healthcare system in the world, and bankrupt our country.”   <br />Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who will remain Minority Leader because candidates like Angle did not prevail, was even more belligerent. He argued Republican lawmakers should vote to repeal healthcare reform, over and over if necessary. Then McConnell took it a step further, maintaining that merely opposing Obama’s policies was insufficient.    <br />Republicans top goal for the next two years should be doing anything and everything possible to deny the President a second term. McConnell reasons the only way for Republicans to undo everything is “to put someone in the White House who won&#8217;t veto any of these things.”    <br />For his part, Obama was chastened by the “shellacking” his Party suffered but unapologetic about his agenda, although he conceded he was so eager about what needed to be done he had forgotten how he promised to do it (i.e. outreach to Republicans and greater civility/bipartisanship). “I do believe there is [still] hope for civility,” he avowed.    <br />Boehner and McConnell flatly stated they would accept Obama’s help only as far as it coincided with their mission.    <br />They say the size of their victory demonstrates the American publicly has roundly rejected Democratic progressivism and this rejection cuts across all demographics and ideologies except for the extreme loony Left. Election results and exit polls tell a different story, however.    <br />For starters, one might assume – given the extent to which Republicans used Obama as a proxy against Democratic contenders – that Democrats who voted with the President would suffer the worst loses while those who distanced themselves and voted against him would do better. In fact, of the thirty-three House Democrats running for re-election who voted against healthcare reform, two-thirds were defeated. About the same was true among the forty-two who voted against Cap and Trade. In comparison, only two Senate Demorats who voted for both the stimulus and healthcare reform lost.    <br />CNN exit polls reject the oft-insisted conservative claim that this election was a referendum against Obamacare. Only seventeen percent of voters considered healthcare reform their top issue and more half voted for Democrats. Likewise, only thirty-seven percent said their vote meant “expressing opposition to Obama.” Even given continuing high unemployment and slow recovery, in the sixteen Democratic-represented Congressional districts hardest hit by the economy, only one flipped Republican.    <br />There is no question that Republicans received a loud and clear mandate from a cadre of energized conservative voters. However, far from representing all Americans, this group was both whiter and, especially, more elderly than the population as a whole. Republicans continued to lose eighteen to twenty-nine year olds by seventeen points. As Harold Meyerson of the <em>Washington Post</em> observed, “There was absolutely a Republican wave on Tuesday, but it looks more like the wave of the past than the wave of the future.”    <br />Republicans won with this cadre and Independent voters, who broke for the GOP in 2010 by about the same margin they went for Obama and Democrats in 2008. They were sending a mandate too but one less about ideological preference and more about results.    <br />The <em>Washington Post</em>’s David Broder explains, “There will be a temptation to interpret the Democrats’ loss of their House majority and of at least six Senate seats as a rejection of Obama&#8217;s first-term agenda . . . American voters are not that flighty or unsettled . . . The biggest problem by far was the economy . . . The worst mistake would be for [Obama] to abandon or reject his own agenda for government.”    <br />Broder’s conservative colleague Charles Krauthammer disagreed, arguing the rejection was so complete that neither Obama nor any future Democratic can or would wish to govern from a progressive philosophy ever again. However, he concurred on this key point – “Republicans [should not] over-interpret their Tuesday mandate. They received none.”    <br />Some pundits argue Obama’s fatal mistake was in overreaching while others maintain he was not nearly aggressive enough. Actually, Obama’s mistake was overestimating how long Americans would be patient over a sluggish economy from which the middle class had failed to benefit long before the recession. Republicans benefited as the only available alternative. They are also next in line for the boot if they fail to deliver. Moreover, nothing suggests voters have grown more patient.    <br />To this end, Republicans must focus on economic growth and creating jobs in the private sector. They must press for reforms but be willing to compromise on details. While attempting to repeal healthcare reform is a gesture owed to their most ardent constituents, they must present viable conservative alternatives to its most unpopular components. This is not my policy prescription but that of Karl Rove, writing in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.    <br />Boehner and McConnell may choose not to heed these admonitions. They may insist they have a mandate that represents the broad will of the American People. They may insist this election represented a permanent seismic shift to the ideological right by this country. They may insist compromise is a dirty word and only total repeal is sufficient. They may insist voters have seen the error of their ways and will patiently wait two years or more for them to build the majorities and power bases necessary to do things the right way. They may insist they only way they will not be successful is if the defeated Party is obstructionist.    <br />Of course, they insisted in the run-up to this election that these are exactly the same mistakes made by the Democratic leadership after 2008. As chief of the defeated, Obama noted in his press conference, “Ultimately, I’ll be judged as President as to the bottom line, results.” The same is true for Boehner, McConnell, and the rest of the Republicans swept into office last week.    <br />It is time for them to quit mandating up and start manning up. They have the acting tough part down pat. Now it is time to work on the taking responsibility part. Otherwise, it will quickly become clear nobody was listening to the American People this election. </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/02/a-whole-bunch-of-prominent-economists-backs-the-use-of-capital-controls.html">Yves Smith</a> at Naked Capitalism offers wise words regarding trade policy agreements and capital flows, in addition to pointing us toward a letter signed by several hundreds of economists regarding capital controls and government.:</p>
<blockquote><p>This letter is at odds with a longstanding project of major financial firms: to allow them to move money across borders with no muss or fuss. This was the dream of Citibank’s Walter Wriston, who perversely was not deterred by the large losses his bank incurred in its sovereign lending misadventures of the late 1970s. It became a matter of policy in the Rubin/Summers Treasury Department. </p>
<p>Although the danger of destabilizing “hot money” inflows has been well recognized since the Asian crisis of 1997, the thrust of US policy has been to continue to push for more capital markets liberalization, particularly in emerging economies. Yet the evidence has continues to mount that a high level of international capital movements isn’t merely a potential threat to developing markets, but to economic stability. As we’ve pointed out repeatedly, the Carmen Reinhart/Kenneth Rogoff work on financial crises showed a strong correlation between high levels of international funds flows and banking crises.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The odd, and telling bit in the debate is the unwitting concession to financiers embedded in the existing terminology: capital controls. <strong>It incorrectly implies that money is every and always stateless, and any effort to restrict it is unnatural</strong>. But truly stateless commodities are highly transportable, high density stores of value whose content can be readily verified: think diamonds (at least pre the era of synthetic diamonds), gold, platinum. But despite their obvious value, what someone receives in exchange if one transports them across borders is very much in doubt, not just due to price fluctuations but also to the difficulties of finding a trustworthy party who would convert the commodity into local currency at a fair rate. </p>
<p>In other words, we’ve all gotten so used to being able to change money, use credit cards, and suck local currency out of ATMs when traveling abroad that we’ve forgotten that this has been put in place with government support. And it has come more recently in some countries than others. I recall running into a McKinsey colleague in the Hong Kong airport in 1985. He was astonished to see that the foreign exchange booths would exchange Indian rupees. The rupee then was a controlled currency; that sort of operation was in theory impermissible. But Hong Kong was always a bit lawless, and this was probably a small scale enough operation so as to fly under any official radar.</p>
<p>But so far, we have been talking about money, and the conversion of currency in a personal/retail context. By contrast, “capital” carries with it the idea of investment. Money is not being moved simply to get it into another country (well it might be if you are a drug dealer or the leader of a banana republic planning your exit strategy) <strong>but to put it to work. That in turn means you expect some sort of legal protection in the recipient country</strong>, ideally as good as the natives get (again note we accept the idea of equal protection under the law in some contexts and not others, so this is not a given). </p>
<p>But what about movement of funds between countries? How exactly is this a matter of rights? For individuals, as with our drug lord example, the reason for trying to move it abroad is almost certainly not legitimate; it’s to escape prosecution and taxation. The US takes the view that the income of its citizens, no matter where earned, is subject to US taxation. Governments lose significant amounts of money due to corporate gaming of tax regimes. Nicholas Shaxson, in his new book Treasure Islands, argues that poor African nations are actually capital exporters. They lose more in tax revenues via arranging their affairs so as to show income in low tax jurisdictions (often with little in the way of real operations there) than they gain in foreign aid. </p>
<p>Now as the letter above acknowledges, international treaties have effectively given investors the right to move funds without restriction into certain types of instruments. But look at the implicit logic, and it’s one that actually goes back to discussions early in the history of the US over whether Congress should charter a bank (yes, Virginia, pre-revolutionary America thrived without banks). The debate centered around differing ideas of what “freedom” meant. </p>
<p>The opponents of the bank charter were concerned about potential abuses that could result from concentrated power. To them, “freedom” meant the right of citizens to take action and use democratic processes to move their government and society in directions that they could hopefully agree on and would produce better outcomes. </p>
<p>The bank advocates, most notably Robert Morris, took a very revealing position: they argued that the government had the right to grant privileges, but not to take them back. It amounted to arguing that economic interests extended to private actors somehow became their property, and that any reversal of these grants was not simply an act of bad faith, but was despotic theft. </p>
<p>Yet we routinely accept the rescinding of government privileges of various sorts; consider the 1990s “end of welfare as we know it” or the expected reductions in pensions of state employees. But when large commercial interests obtain valuable economic rights, reining them back when they are found to impose undue costs on others is depicted in a completely different light. Restricting them isn’t framed neutrally, as, say, a revision, but as a “control” when the prevailing ideology treats that as a “c” word.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2011/01/29/davos-two-worlds-ready-or-not/#more-8584" target="_blank">Simon Johnson</a> at Baseline Scenario notes that (bolding mine) </p>
<blockquote><p>On the fringes of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos this week, there was plenty of substantive discussion – including about the dangers posed by our “too big to fail”/”too big to save” banks, the consequences of widening inequality (reinforced by persistent unemployment in some countries), and why the jobs picture in the U.S. looks so bad.</p>
<p>But in the core keynote events and more generally around any kind of CEO-related interaction, such themes completely failed to resonate.  There is, of course, variation in views across CEOs and the people work intellectual agendas on their behalf, but still the mood among this group was uniformly positive – it was hard to detect any note of serious concern.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p><strong>Many of the people who control the world’s largest corporations are quite comfortable with the status quo post-financial crisis</strong>.  This makes sense for them – and poses a major problem for the rest of us.The thinking here is fairly obvious.  The CEOs who provide the bedrock of financial support for Davos have mostly done well in the past few years.  For the nonfinancial sector, there was a major scare in 2008-09; the disruption of credit was a big shock and dire consequences were feared.  And for leaders of the financial sector this was more than an awkward moment – they stood accused, including by fellow CEOs at Davos in previous years, of incompetence, greed, and excessively capturing the state.</p>
<p>But all of this, from a CEO perspective, is now behind them.  Profits are good – this is <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2011/01/27/president-obama-and-big-business-can-get-on-well-%E2%80%93-when-will-that-produce-jobs/">the best bounce back</a> on average in the post-war period; given that so many small companies are struggling,<strong> it is reasonable to infer that the big companies have done disproportionately well</strong> (perhaps because their smaller would-be competitors are still having more trouble accessing credit).  Executive compensation at the largest firms will no doubt reflect this in the months and years ahead.</p>
<p>In terms of public policy, the big players in the financial sector have prevailed – no responsible European, for example, can imagine a major bank being allowed to fail (in the sense of defaulting on any debt).  And this government support for banks has translated into easier credit conditions for the major global corporations represented at Davos. </p>
<p>The public policy issue of the day, from the point of view of such CEOs, is simple.  <strong>There needs to be sufficient fiscal austerity to strengthen public balance sheets – so that states can more effectively stand behind their banks in the future, and to keep currencies from moving too much. </strong> Leading bankers, in particular, insisted on the paramount importance of providing unlimited government support to their sector during 2008-09; now they insist with equal or greater vigor that support to all other parts of society be curtailed.</p>
<p>This is where cognitive dissonance creeps in. <strong> Most CEOs feel that the provision of general public goods is not their responsibility, although they are very happy to help guide (or capture) the provision of public goods specific to their firm. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the big multinational companies current US trade policy also works quite well.  What is not talked about are conditions for US companies that are mainly domestic.</p>

<p>Like Ezra Klein, I found one of the drier examples very informative</p>
<blockquote><p>The firm had already raised the employees’ insurance co-payments considerably [skip] employee health costs continued to rise—climbing almost ten per cent each year. The company was baffled.</p>
<p>Gunn’s team took a look at the hot spots. The outliers, it turned out, were predominantly early retirees. Most had multiple chronic conditions—in particular, coronary-artery disease, asthma, and complex mental illness. One had badly worsening heart disease and diabetes, and medical bills over two years in excess of eighty thousand dollars. The man, dealing with higher co-payments on a fixed income, had cut back to filling only half his medication prescriptions for his high cholesterol and diabetes. He made few doctor visits. He avoided the E.R.—until a heart attack necessitated emergency surgery and left him disabled with chronic heart failure.</p>
<p>The higher co-payments had backfired, Gunn said. While medical costs for most employees flattened out, those for early retirees jumped seventeen per cent. The sickest patients became much more expensive because they put off care and prevention until it was too late.</p></blockquote>

<p>They got a young Harvard internist named Rushika Fernandopulle to run a clinic exclusively for workers with exceptionally high medical expenses.</p>
<p>[skip]</p>
<p>I got a glimpse of how unusual the clinic is when I sat in on the staff meeting it holds each morning to review the medical issues of the patients on the appointment books. There was, for starters, the very existence of the meeting. I had never seen this kind of daily huddle at a doctor’s office, with clinicians popping open their laptops and pulling up their patient lists together. Then there was the particular mixture of people who squeezed around the conference table. As in many primary-care offices, the staff had two physicians and two nurse practitioners. But a full-time social worker and the front-desk receptionist joined in for the patient review, too. And, outnumbering them all, there were eight full-time “health coaches.”</p>
<p>[skip]</p>
<p>Few had clinical experience. I asked each of the coaches what he or she had done before working in the Special Care Center. One worked the register at a Dunkin’ Donuts. Another was a Sears retail manager. A third was an administrative assistant at a casino.</p>
<p>“We recruit for attitude and train for skill,” Fernandopulle said.</p>
<p>[skip]</p>
<p>compared with the Las Vegas workers, the Atlantic City workers in Fernandopulle’s program experienced a twenty-five-per-cent drop in costs.</p>

<p><strong>A Few Graphs on Real GDP Growth Rates versus Taxes and the Size of Government</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=312">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>This post has a few simple graphs showing the relationship between the growth in real GDP and a few other variables:  the top marginal tax rate, spending by the federal government as a share of GDP, and non defense spending by the federal government as a share of GDP.  I also plan to link the three graphs together into a bit of a story, a story which extends from my recent posts, and which I intend to build on over the next few weeks. </p>
<p>One note before we begin &#8211; all of the data in this post comes from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) tables which go back to 1929, or the IRS (tax rates go back to 1913), so the graphs will all begin in 1929.  </p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the % growth in real GDP from one year to the next on the primary vertical axis and the top marginal income tax rate for that year on the secondary vertical axis.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUZfZAffFWI/AAAAAAAAAhQ/URLzcbTOfsg/s1600/marginal1.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUZfZAffFWI/AAAAAAAAAhQ/URLzcbTOfsg/s400/marginal1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>A couple things to notice… to the naked eyeball, there doesn’t seem to be all that much of a relationship between marginal rates and growth, despite the commonly accepted story line about how higher marginal rates lead to slower economic growth.  Making matters worse for conventional wisdom, the correlation between the top marginal tax rate in any given year and the growth rate from that year to the next has been positive for every time period in the little table that is pasted in the graph.  In other words, for all the years for which official data exists, higher tax rates have been accompanied by faster economic growth and lower tax rates were accompanied by slower economic growth.  (Regular readers know this also applies at the state and local level.)  Anyone telling you that lower tax rates lead to faster economic growth in the U.S. either should begin by explaining why this time it’s different or has nothing useful to say about the subject.  (And I guess it is becoming a tradition, but let me ask – please don’t bother me with Romer and Romer.  It doesn’t say what you think it says.  It doesn’t even say what <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/01/further-critique-of-romer-and-romer.html">Romer and Romer</a> think it says.)  </p>
<p>Now, the American mythos circa 2011 also tells you that that the bigger the government, the slower the economic growth.  (Note – since the tax rates I showed are federal tax rates, I am going to use the federal government here rather than “total” government.  If I went with the entire government it wouldn’t change all that much of the verbiage below.)  Figure 2 shows the % growth in real GDP from one year to the next on the primary vertical axis and the size of the federal government relative to GDP for that year on the secondary vertical axis.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUZfZRBQGJI/AAAAAAAAAhY/oqkgEy-JbOo/s1600/marginal2.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUZfZRBQGJI/AAAAAAAAAhY/oqkgEy-JbOo/s400/marginal2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a> Figure 2.</p>
<p>Well, for most of the sample, it seems the correlation between growth rates and the size of the Federal government is positive.  That is to say, the larger the federal government’s role in the economy in any given year, the faster the growth rate from that year to the next.  However… the correlation turned negative in the tail end of the sample.  (See the note at the bottom of the graph – the federal government shrunk under Bill Clinton (in fact, it shrunk every single year of his term, which means you can’t credit Newt Gingrich, at least not if you’re honest), and then rose in six of the eight years GW was in office.)</p>
<p>Figure 3 is similar, but instead of the Federal government’s entire piece of GDP, it shows non-defense Federal spending as a share of GDP:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUZfZcf1j4I/AAAAAAAAAhg/g9saXPfgme4/s1600/marginal3.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUZfZcf1j4I/AAAAAAAAAhg/g9saXPfgme4/s400/marginal3.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3.</p>
<p>Now, the non-defense piece of government spending is the stuff Republicans and libertarians really hate – welfare, fighting epidemics, infrastructure, etc.  And it turns out that for much of the sample, in years when that bad stuff has made up a bigger part of the economy, the economy went on to grow more quickly from that year to the next.  </p>
<p>Now…  let me repeat a few facts (in a slightly different order than they came up):</p>
<p>1.        The top marginal tax rate is positively correlated with real GDP growth over the coming year.  The correlation dips a bit in the ‘70s and ‘80s, though it never goes negative.</p>
<p>2.       Non-defense federal spending as a share of GDP is positively correlated with real GDP growth over the coming year until the 1980s.  </p>
<p>3.       The size of the federal government is positively correlated with real GDP growth over the coming year until the 1990s. </p>
<p>So what’s a story that fits these and other known facts?  I think it’s one where the economy was growing rapidly for many of the years from 1933 to about 1973.  That year, due to a combination of various forms of incompetence* malaise and fat sideburns started setting in.  A story line started making the rounds:  the tax rate is too high and government is too big.  The tax rate is too high thing caught on with the public first – after all, nobody likes to pay taxes.  The historic relationship between tax rates and growth began to fray, but it never quite died.  Nevertheless, it led to a political groundswell and tax rates were, in fact, cut tremendously in the 1980s.  Growth rates subsequently fell.</p>
<p>However, the 1980s brought with it something else, another political change in public perceptions.  The government is not solution, or even a help, but rather a problem.  (Truth be told, the cachet of the government had been falling for a while, but St. Ronald the Reagan and his acolytes really opened the floodgates.)  The military excluded, of course.  The result:  in many fields, competent people who in earlier years would have gone to work for the government instead went into such value-adding enterprises as market manipulation and financial arson.  The correlation between non-defense government spending as a share of GDP and real growth went negative.  The problem with maligning the non-defense portion of the government is that ill-will doesn’t stay contained.  Eventually, the correlation between even defense spending and the economy flipped.  </p>
<p>So where are we now?  Some of the very things that created the very rapid growth <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/01/median-itis.html">from 1947 to 1973</a>, who’s kidding who, make that from 1933 to 1973, were taken apart, first in the public perception and second on the ground.  And we’ve been growing more slowly, and at times, not at all, ever since.  </p>

<p>Incidentally – I mentioned last week I intended to cover the fact that a number of the graphs I’ve been putting up are bimodal.  That’s still on my radar screen.  I just realized I want to build my narrative in a slightly different order.</p>
<p>*  Incompetence by the Nixon administration (too much spending, an adherence to the gold standard, and price controls), incompetence by the Arthur Burns led-Fed (inflation, which only got exacerbated by Burns’ attempts to ensure Nixon’s re-election in 1972), incompetence by the USSR (failure to keep the Arab countries from realizing that regardless of their advantage in numbers and materiel, they were too ridiculously incompetent to expect success from attacking a second rate local power yet again), and incompetence by Henry Kissinger (reigning in the Israeli military when it was 60 miles from Cairo and about the same distance from Damascus… which eventually led to the Oil Embargo, not to mention the Middle East we see today).</p>

<p><strong>Update on conditions in Ireland&#8230;a second letter from Ireland</strong></p>
<p>Ireland, Land of Thieves, Charlatans and Sodomites… Zeus-Boy</p>
<p>We’re forced to do silly things out of desperation, things that other nations don’t have to resort to. For instance, we’ve the lowest corporate tax rate in Europe at 12.5%. Sarkozy recently excoriated us for this. But we use it as an incentive to bait the multi-nationals. We’ve no other choice. Why else would the big companies bother locating here? If the labour market is cheaper elsewhere then we have to compete somehow, we&#8217;re told. We lure them in by offering them tax shelters. We even set aside developed estates for them and we build their factories when they come, with the <em>Taoiseach </em>on hand to cut the ribbons. Their overheads remain very low and then we allow them to siphon all their profits out of the country. Talk about being recolonized by self-imposed deference, but Ireland is a dependent economy and does what it must do to survive.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />There are other options, of course. There’s the old reliable one of emigration. 100,000 people will leave Ireland this year alone, and the numbers are rising, again. That’s one way of solving unemployment, but it’s not completely or satisfactorily solving our problem. Our crisis. As of this month, the CSO (Central Statistics Office) <a href="http://www.cso.ie/statistics/sasunemprates.htm">http://www.cso.ie/statistics/sasunemprates.htm</a> quotes the unemployment rate at 14.1%, that’s over 400,000 people out of work. Those people will be on the dole or getting some version of welfare, which starts at €197 per week and rises according to number of dependents.</p>
<p> The CSO’s figures are frightening. They say that of the over 800,000 mortgages <a href="http://www.cso.ie/statistics/sasunemprates.htm">http://www.cso.ie/statistics/sasunemprates.htm</a> in the country, worth €120 billion, 40,000 are in arrears and that figure will rise to 70,000 in the coming year: the banks will be forced to repossess these houses. But the banks don’t want all that property. What good is it to them? They especially don’t want to be shackled with toxic real estate when so many are already in negative equity. Every town and village in the country sports its token ghost estate, the relic of the boom years, a reminder of the savage greed that swiftly plunged us into ruin. More on that in a bit. The ESB [Electricity Supply Board <a href="http://www.esb.ie/main/home/index.jsp">http://www.esb.ie/main/home/index.jsp</a>] are shutting off service to 50 homes per month for non-payment of bills.</p>
<p>Health Care in Ireland is totally banjaxed: My father who is 80 spent three nights on a trolley in a hallway last year because there were no beds available. He is no longer able to regulate his body temperature because he suffers from leukemia and other complications, so he nearly shivered to death in the one place he went to for care. My sister is a doctor but she could do nothing. Our Health Care system was dismantled and then rebuilt in order to centralize it, hospitals were closed all over the country and acute services scaled back or abandoned altogether. A moratorium on hiring nurses and doctors was instituted and all administrative staff downsized. </p>
<p>The Minister for Health who oversaw this fiasco, Mary Harney, has just resigned her ministerial post and will get a lump sum of €310,000 plus a pension when she leaves office. We like to reward incompetence in Ireland. Education isn’t faring any better: we dumb down our students and prepare them for a life of servitude and passivity. A moratorium has also been placed on the hiring of new teachers, a freeze more like, and funding has been withdrawn from special needs projects. Almost every other state run body is experiencing the same level of incompetence, and yet the nation is expected to grow its economy enough to pay its debts and still balance its books.</p>
<p>It’s not helpful to speak about the criminal behavior that got our country into this debacle. We’re not allowed to focus on the deranged and delusional freak-show that was the hybrid known as the Celtic Tiger. Our attention is quickly diverted if we mention how local councils all over the country used their zoning powers to wheedle dirty money from developers [this being their only way to raise money] in order to line the pockets of avaricious landowners and bankers. Many of these useless developments were erected on flood plains or dangerously unsuitable terrain. It didn’t matter so long as the bonanza was in full tilt. </p>
<p>We’re supposed to forget that the bankers were throwing money at these developers and builders, money they didn’t have, and never had, money they were borrowing from German savers anxious to invest their surplus. Nobody thought for one second any of this would have to be repaid. Meanwhile, a select group were living the high life, like oil barons or movie stars jetting here and there, flying their private planes and helicopters all over the country to race meetings and golf tournaments and toddler birthday parties. And when they ran out of suitable sump holes in Ireland they spread their good cheer abroad. Over €1,265 billion was invested by Irish citizens abroad in 2009. One shouldn’t mention that the bankers were in the pockets of the builders, who were in the pockets of the developers, who were in the pockets of the politicians and that the resulting circle jerk which met in secret every few days, regular as clockwork, had a grand old wanking session. It is downright begrudgery to allude to the financial regulator or the governor of the Central Bank or to ask how they could sleep so soundly through the nightmare that was the rape of their country.</p>
<p>But the house of cards was destined to collapse and when it eventually did we all know what happened next. It’s yesterday&#8217;s news now: the good old boys in the government provided all the safety nets their hand-shandy buddies needed, bailouts, emergency loans, triage funding, congratulatory pats on the ass and golden mickey shakes when they fled the country. It has emerged that our <em>Taoiseach</em> personally guaranteed the odious thugs at Anglo <a href="http://www.tribune.ie/business/news/article/2011/jan/16/book-review-the-fitzpatrick-tapes/">http://www.tribune.ie/business/news/article/2011/jan/16/book-review-the-fitzpatrick-tapes/</a> and used NTMA <a href="http://www.thejournal.ie/drumm-claims-cowen-asked-ntma-to-invest-in-anglo-2011-01/">http://www.thejournal.ie/drumm-claims-cowen-asked-ntma-to-invest-in-anglo-2011-01/</a> money [resources reserved by Treasury Management for the daily running of the country], to infuse their defunct and toxic bank with the exchequer &#8216;s funds. The government then nationalized those broken banks, claimed their problems were systemic and shackled the tax-payer with their very private and self-inflicted debt.</p>
<p> The banks debts has now become our sovereign debts, just as NAMA nationalized all the ghost estates and turned the inflated and non-buyable property over to the citizens, as if they’d acquired a new portfolio. Merrill-Lynch was solicited for its counsel prior to the fiasco and advised against a blanket bank guarantee.<br />That didn’t matter, cronies is cronies, the old boys club needed bailing and the subservient and pliant peasantry could be directed to cough and pay up. That’s what we do so well in Ireland – we rant and rave, we purge and we vent the pent, we get sloshed or high, then we return home in the early hours with our dignity between our legs, all limp and shriveled up, poxed and ridden, and we bend the deferential knee, bare our arses for the ritualistic buggery and we thank our sado-masochistic sodomites for giving us a good hammering. We did it for 800 years. It&#8217;s in our blood. And when the Brits left, we installed the church as sodomite-in-chief, just in case we might think ourselves free, self-determining, and independent. We daren’t ask or hold anyone accountable. What’s the use when the slick politicians will only lie and cheat their way out of culpability anyway? We’ll shoulder the burden and we’ll always be ready with the Vaseline.</p>
<p>Besides, our politicians are incorrigible, especially the fuckheads in Fianna Fáil, who’ve been in power for most of our republic’s history. They’ve sold our future into slavery, thrown away our sovereignty, reduced a nation to penury, dismantled an infrastructure that was the envy of the civilized world, broken every institution, shown contempt for the people and utterly disgraced our country. They&#8217;ve said to our neighbours across the pond, &#8216;you were right all along; we were incapable of governing ourselves. We tried and look at the mess we made of things.&#8217; Instead of focusing on the emergency state we now find ourselves in with mass emigration, mass unemployment, a colossal and unmanageable debt, inflation rising and a very bleak future in store, what do these fuckers do? They propose patriotism for the rest of us and entitlement for themselves: we are expected to live on fresh air as they feather their own nests. I can only imagine if a man like Dan Breen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Breen">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Breen</a> were alive today to see what has been made of his sacrifice.</p>
<p>Instead of serving the people, as they were elected to do, these fools turn inward and bicker amongst themselves; their only public statements now are pontifications about their own virtues and to engage in cynical electioneering. Instead of working together, all of them, to save the country they destroyed, they resort to internecine feuds, screaming and yelling at one another across the floor of the Dáil chamber, tearing one another asunder, raising votes of no confidence in their own leader, voting in and out that leader, threatening to resign, and then resigning [six cabinet ministers resigned their posts last week], but not before receiving their handsome <em>Ex Gratia</em> lump sums and, rather than face the truth of his political demise, the leader who has lost half his cabinet persists in the delusion that he can still run the country with a mandate, he refuses to step down or call an election, but then finally he agrees to resign as the leader of his party while remaining as <em>Taoiseach</em>. Such grotesque shenanigans have robbed the people of any confidence they might still have had in the political process. People are pissed off, royally pissed off, not that they will do anything about it.<br />Our country is a joke, a farce. We’re a disgrace. </p>
<p>Our politicians are gombeen men and women. They’re still only out for number one. While the country is being flushed down into the sewer and the citizenry is drowning in tidal waves of slurry, these clueless, incompetent and shameless bastards are only worried only about whether their political party will survive, whether this or that machination is good for the party, whether the party will be strengthened or weakened going in to the next general election. It’s all a load of tripe. They don’t care about the people. They’ve grown so cynical and greedy, with their Mercs and perks, their expense accounts and their lump sums and pensions, their endless bailouts and their profligate sense of entitlement that the people don’t even compute in their perfidious calculus. It’s all about themselves, their self-interest, their advancement, their self-aggrandizement. </p>
<p>They will never want for anything again, so it’s easy for them to be cavalier about austerity and to bandy about the patriotic buzz words. They’re secure and protected. And we’re the mindless cretins who have protected them. Ireland is broken and on a deathward spiral. The country&#8217;s in a shambles and why wouldn’t it be when <i>Biffo’s</i> <a href="http://www.broadsheet.ie/wp-content/gallery/cowen-apology-slide-show/731-brian-cowen-tg4-launch.jpg">http://www.broadsheet.ie/wp-content/gallery/cowen-apology-slide-show/731-brian-cowen-tg4-launch.jpg</a> is the ugly mug we present to the world. If it’s true people get the representatives they deserve, then we Irish aren&#8217;t worth a bucketful of rabid mongrel’s piss.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>It occurred to me that some Angry Bear readers may be interested in a short analysis of the Egyptian bond market. Professionally, I&#8217;m a macroeconomic analyst and portfolio manager on a global fixed income team. Since we do trade emerging market debt, of which Egyptian debt is categorized, I&#8217;ll be happy to comment.</p>
<p>The gist of the article is this: markets are pricing the probability of default in Portugal and Egypt similarly &#8211; I&#8217;d sell protection on the Egyptian debt. At this point, I should state the following disclaimer: this is not a trade recommendation, nor does this represent my firm&#8217;s views on Egypt or Portugal.</p>
<p>Some bond market developments of late:
<ol>
<li>Egypt holds a BBB- rating on its local currency debt by Fitch and S&#038;P (BB+ on its foreign currency debt). The local currency debt in Egypt is at the lowest of the investment-grade ratings, while on January 20, 2011, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=133307715">Fitch put Egypt on credit-watch negative</a>.</li>
<li>The Egyptian pound is heavily managed. Over the last week, the USD gained just 0.9% against the pound. Maintaining a stronger nominal currency is common in developing economies to temper the effects of import prices (in this case, food).</li>
<li>The 5.75% 10-yr Egyptian international bond, which is denominated in USD, sold off 7% over the last week. According to JP Morgan, Egypt is well underperforming the index (Egpyt is roughly 0.5% of the index): the year to date total return on the Egyptian international bonds is -10%, while that of the  JP Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index Global (EMBIG) is -0.7%.</li>
<li>Credit default swap spreads jumped 50% over the last week to 454 basis points (bps), according to one Bloomberg source (no link, subscription required). CDS are bilateral contracts between two parties, so pricing varies somewhat &#8211; but the trend is the same among all sources: up. This means that it&#8217;s becoming increasingly expensive to buy protection against Egyptian sovereign default.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to know more about CDS, please see a <a href="http://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD/PROD0000000000252032.pdf">helpful 2009 publication by Deutsche Bank.</a></p>
<p>And this is where it gets interesting: it currently costs the same to buy 5-yr protection on Egyptian bonds (454 bps) as on Portuguese bonds (456 bps). And Portugal is rated A- (negative outlook).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TUVhBPk6BsI/AAAAAAAADcw/L3Cb1VPwO28/s1600/CDS_chart.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TUVhBPk6BsI/AAAAAAAADcw/L3Cb1VPwO28/s400/CDS_chart.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a> (more after the jump)<br /><a name="more"></a>The chart above illustrates a panel of CDS data for countries with similar market risk, where S&#038;P&#8217;s local currency rating is listed in the legend. The CDS quoted above are priced in USD, rather than the local currency; but the spreads do quantify the market&#8217;s assigned probability of default : 29.3% for Egypt vs. 29% for Portugal (with a 30% recovery rate on both).</p>
<p>Generally the decision to default comes in two flavors: the &#8216;willingness&#8217; and &#8216;ability&#8217; to pay. Also, default can take many forms, like missed coupon payments, terming out debt liabilities, or bankruptcy (corporate).</p>
<p>Willingess. A quick analysis of &#8216;governance&#8217; indicators at the World Bank says that on the face of it, Portugal is probably more willing to pay its debts. The governance measures are corruption, government effectiveness, political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law, and voice and accountability. Read about the methodology of the governance indicators <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1682130">here</a> and get the data <a href="http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.asp">here</a>.</p>
<p>In sum, Portugal ranks much higher on the total of the World Bank governance indicators, 6.4, compared to -2.6 for Egypt (I use a strict sum of the 6 components).</p>
<p>Ability. According to the IMF&#8217;s most recent World Economic Outlook (<a href="http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=28">October 2010 database</a>), Egypt is expected to grow an average 13.9% per year in nominal terms over the next three years (2010-2013). In contrast, Portugal is expected to grow just 1.7% on average for the next three years.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, on January 27, 2011, the yield on a Portuguese 1-year local bond is 3.42%, while that for a local Egyptian bond is 10.99%. I&#8217;ll take odds of payment on the one with nominal growth that exceeds the payment &#8211; Egypt.</p>

<p>The 2011 outlook demonstrates the following: government deficits are similar in Portugal and Egypt; government debt is higher in Portugal, a country that has no monetary sovereignty; Portugal has relatively fewer reserves (comparing gross debt to net debt); and the current account deficit in Portugal dwarfs that of Egypt.</p>
<p>If I was an investment bank, I&#8217;d rather sell protection on Egypt than Portugal at these prices.</p>

                                <p>As the late Allison Snow-Jones noted, <a href="http://www.maxineudall.com/2011/01/economics-art-or-science.html">economics depends on working mathematics</a>. Mathematics, in turn, depend on the conditions being described correctly. If I build a model in which two things are independent, they have to be independent for my model to work.  Or, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/02/in-other-news-larry-king-is-selling.html">to quote a quoting</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/roubinis-not-wrong-but.html">Many months ago</a>, I quoted the brilliant <a href="http://www.tavakolistructuredfinance.com/index.html">Janet Tavakoli</a>&#8216;s book <a href="http://www.booksamillion.com/product/9780471412663?id=4214424925428">Credit Derivatives and Synthetic Structures</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The trader then went on to tell me that Commercial Bank of Korea would sell credit default protection on bonds issued by the Commercial Bank of Korea.<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s very interesting,&#8221; I countered, &#8220;but the credit default option is worthless.&#8221;<br />&#8220;But people are doing it,&#8221; persisted the trader.<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing,&#8221; I affirmed. &#8220;The correlation between Commercial Bank of Korea and itself is 100 percent. I would pay nothing for that credit protection. It is worthless for this purpose.&#8221;<br />The trader mustered his best grammar, chilliest tone, and most authoritative voice: &#8220;There are those who would disagree with you.&#8221; (p. 85)</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>That apparently includes <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2011/01/26/470141/spains-smallish-wrongish-non-basel-iii-bank-steps/">the Spanish government</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Frob capital injection comes in the form of convertible preference shares from the Frob, or Spain’s Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring. As a reminder, the Frob itself has lending capacity of €15bn and can leverage itself to €99bn by issuing bonds — guaranteed by the Kingdom of Spain — to private investors.</p>
<p>And the equity it lends to banks really resembles more of a subordinated loan than actual loss-absorbing capital. What’s more, it pays a coupon and is excluded from core Tier 1 calculations under <a href="http://www.nortonrose.com/knowledge/publications/2010/pub31077.aspx?lang=en-gb&#038;page=all">incoming Basel III rules</a> for this very reason.</p>
<p>Did we mention the Frob is <a href="http://www.frob.es/financiera/doc/20110115%20Presentacion%20FROB%20inversores%20English.pdf">also backed</a> by Spain?</p></blockquote>
<p>I realise all the attention is on Egypt right now—and <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/watch_now/">it should be</a>&mdaash;but the rest of the world is going to be there on Monday, too.  And traditional &#8220;sovereign risk management&#8221; still has a ways to go.</p>
