<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/05/did_the_bush_ta.html">Mark Thoma</a> has started an interesting discussion beginning with a Q&#038;A with Paul Krugman:<br />
<blockquote>Alan Gertler, Reno, Nev.: I&#8217;m a scientist, not an economist, so I&#8217;m fairly naive when it comes to what drives the economy. My question is this: Have the tax cuts stimulated the economy as claimed (which I don&#8217;t believe given the past cases of Reagan and Bush senior), or has it been the willingness of the government to continue massive spending by increasing our debt that has led to the growth of the economy?<br />Paul Krugman: It&#8217;s actually neither. About the Bush tax cuts: the tax cuts of 2001 evidently didn&#8217;t do the job; these days, the Bush people talk about the economy as if history began in the middle of 2003, after their SECOND wave of tax cuts. But while the economy did start growing, finally, in 2003, the growth wasn&#8217;t at all of the form you&#8217;d expect if tax cuts were responsible. The main tax cuts were on dividends and capital gains; supposedly this would make it easier for businesses to raise funds and invest. But business investment hasn&#8217;t been the main driver of growth; in fact, businesses have been sitting on huge piles of earnings, reluctant to invest. Instead, the big driver was housing construction and consumer spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think Paul is generally right here but I had a wee bit of a problem with the last two sentences that was very ably addressed by a comment to Mark’s blog from Spencer.  Mark had kindly provided an update with a chart of growth rate for non-residential investment, which my chart below does using annualized growth rates and includes real GDP growth, consumption growth, and residential investment growth.  The simple empirical point is that non-residential investment growth has been strong since 2003.  To which Spencer says:<br />
<blockquote>In the major econometric models business investment is driven by corporate profits. Given the increase in profits we have seen this cycle the rebound in capital spending is disappointing. But it is like so many other things, what we are seeing is a fairly normal cyclical development and there is little evidence that the tax cuts made a significant  difference. Another point that relates to this is to break capital spending down into information technology and software vs. all other, or traditional capital spending. If you look at real investment as a share of gdp what you find is that traditional capital spending is still about the same as it was in the late 1960s early 1970s. All the growth in capital spending since 1980 has been in the high technology sectors. If tax policy played a major role in the increase in capital spending shouldn&#8217;t it hav impacted all sectors. the fact that the growth has been contrasted in one sector implies that the driving force are factors within that sector &#8212; like falling prices &#8212; rather then economy wide factors like taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said so all I had to add was:<br />
<blockquote>If one only looked at investment spending since the 2003 tax law change … and if one was silly enough to do the Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc nonsense they teach over at the economics department of National Review University, one might go &#8220;wow &#8211; the tax cut worked&#8221;. But as you have so eloquently noted, one would have to look at a real model that would include various factors that would explain variation in investment demand. If the other factors fully explain the increase, then the marginal impact of this tax law change is from modest to zero &#8211; at least per our model.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – recessions come and go without tax cuts.  Beyond that – classical economists have the long-term properties right: if you give people their money back so they can consume more but then do not cut government purchases, national savings decline.</p>

                                <p>That didn’t take long.  When <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/niskanen.html">William Niskanen</a> produced a regression that suggested years in which taxes were low also tended to be years in which spending was high, one had to expect that the <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MGY0NDk5NDU3NzMyNjM5ZGVhZWZjMWZkY2M1OGYzMDQ=">National Review</a> would have some comment:<br />
<blockquote>While Niskanen has accounted for the effects of the business cycle, he has not taken account of the possibility that tax cuts cause spending cuts after a few years. It may be, for example, that Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts helped doom Bill Clinton’s push for socialized medicine.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not so original.  Haven’t these fellows already suggested that the 1981 tax cut caused the 1990’s peace dividend?  Besides, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were followed by that bloated prescription drug benefit that Bush is now using to brag about passing around free money.  </p>
<p>But it is the rest of this paragraph that defies reality:<br />
<blockquote>And even if it were the case that tax cuts do not, by themselves, make it easier to cut spending, that would hardly negate the economic case for cutting taxes that punish saving, investment, and work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, St. Reagan’s “work, saving, and invest” slogan.  Only problem was that national savings FELL after the 1981 tax cut and national savings are lower today than they were in 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzAwMWJmMjE2M2UwN2YyNjI3NDIyZTI5ZWQyMWY1NGE=">Nick Schulz</a> takes this Niskanen regression in a different direction suggesting that we should raise taxes in order for Americans to demand spending cuts too.  What I found interesting was his link to the latest from <a href="http://www.nber.org/books/tpe20/gokhale-smetters9-22-05.pdf">Jagadeesh Gokhale and Kent Smetters</a>:<br />
<blockquote>the nation’s fiscal imbalance has grown from around $44 trillion dollars as of fiscal yearend 2002 to about $63 trillion, mostly due to the recent adoption of the prescription drug bill (Medicare, Part D). The imbalance also grows by more than $1.5 trillion (in inflation adjusted terms) each year that action is not taken to reduce it. This imbalance now equals about 8 percent of all future GDP and it could, in theory, be eliminated by more-than doubling the employer-employee payroll tax from 15.3 percent of wages to over 32 percent immediately and forever – assuming, quite critically, no reduction in labor supply or national saving and capital formation. Equivalently, massive cuts in government spending would be required to achieve fiscal balance: The total federal fiscal imbalance now equals 77.8 percent of non-Social Security and non-Medicare outlays.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, part of the solution might also be to repeal the income tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 and to repeal the prescription drug benefit or otherwise find some means for paying for it.</p>

                                <p>Alan Greenspan makes an important point:<br />
<blockquote>NEW YORK (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BED48C515-D81A-42FF-B960-59E346042328%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8212; Former Fed chief Alan Greenspan sent a message to Washington policymakers: Don&#8217;t think about naming him to another commission seeking to untie the Gordian knot of Social Security reform.</p>
<p>&#8230;Greenspan warned that retirement health-care costs are more of a problem for the federal government than fixing Social Security.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Social Security will get resolved. The real fiscal problem is Medicare,&#8221; Greenspan said. &#8220;I&#8217;m fearful we have already committed more that we can afford.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it is time for a &#8220;Medicare commission?&#8221; the moderator asked, breathlessly.</p>
<p>Please no, Greenspan replied. &#8220;I could write the [commission&#8217;s] report in 20 minutes,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that I would disagree substantially with the report that Greenspan would write about how to solve to the Medicare crisis.  But he&#8217;s quite right that Medicare is the real fiscal problem, and that there are obvious solutions that do not take a rocket scientist (or even an economist) to figure out: Medicare benefits could be cut (that would be Greenspan&#8217;s 20-minute commission report), or, if that is not a popular option (which it won&#8217;t be, and shouldn&#8217;t be), then taxes could be increased to close the enormous Medicare funding gap.</p>
<p>My preferred solution to the Medicare crisis is different, though: I would advocate a complete overhaul of the nation&#8217;s health insurance system, for example by moving to a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/moving-to-single-payer-system.html">single-payer system</a>.  Properly done, such a move could generate enormous savings that would enable us to afford decent health insurance without large tax increases.  Why not try for the best of both worlds?</p>

<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/inflation-fears.html">Kash’s post</a> on the latest consumer price inflation news allows us to raise a couple of additional points.  Our first graph provides the latest on real wages for production or nonsupervisory workers, which have generally been declining over the past two years as nominal wage increases have not kept pace with consumer price inflation.  While most students who have taken a couple of principles of economics classes understand the difference between nominal wage increases versus changes in real wages, apparently <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2006/05/17/gotcha">John Snow</a> does not:<br />
<blockquote>To which Frank said: “OK, because you’ve got hourly earnings going up 3.8%, and I believe…that’s not adjusted for inflation. So my understanding is that even in the past 12 months, which are your best 12 months, hourly wages have barely kept up with inflation….. But you would acknowledge that 3.8% increase in wages you’re talking about is nominal, not adjusted for inflation, correct? Snow, who has a Ph.D. in economics, was a bit flummoxed at first. “I’ll have to go back, Congressman, and check these numbers,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our second graph shows the recent increase in real interest rates, which Kash attributes to the tightening of monetary policy in order to avoid an acceleration of inflation.  </p>
<p>The fiscal situation in 2006 is reminding me more and more of the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/george-w-bush-lbj-on-fiscal-policy.html">1966 fiscal situation</a> and the resulting <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/69/09/Historical_Sep1969.pdf">Credit Crunch</a>.  As we noted, the economic advisors to President Johnson warned him that continued fiscal stimulus would crowd-out investment.  I hope (and suspect) that the Council of Economic Advisors are saying similar things to President Bush.  I fear (and suspect) that the President refuses to listen to his own economists.  Why?  He and his political hacks are too busy telling us his fiscal fiasco is good for long-term growth even though most economists argue just the opposite. </p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I’ve taken the liberty of composing a picture that addresses the implausible notion that the Federal government’s budget deficits are the result of “<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/david-brooks-absolves-republicans-from.html">ungoverned forces</a>”.</p>
<p>The graph below shows the on-budget federal budget balance – that is, the budget balance excluding the Social Security Trust Fund surplus – and the ways in which various deliberate policy choices have contributed to it.  The lower-most heavy red line shows the actual budget deficit that we’ve seen over the past several years, as well as the forecast for the remainder of the Bush presidency from the CBO (see the January 2006 report: <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=7027&#038;type=1">Budget and Economic Outlook</a>), including the recently-passed extension of the cut in capital gains taxes and AMT relief.  Excluding the Social Security surplus, the deficit will be around $550bn this year, and will remain at that level for the rest of Bush&#8217;s time in office.  (Though it’s worth noting that if there’s a recession any time in the next three years the deficits will grow to be much larger.)</p>
<p>This deficit is then decomposed into various components that correspond to specific legislative changes made by the Bush administration and the Republican Congress over the past five years.  The CBO estimates the cost of each change to tax laws and spending legislation, and provides those estimates in their regular “Budget Outlook” reports.  I&#8217;ve compiled all of those cost estimates and put them together to make this graph.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/deficit_responsibility4.jpg"></p>
<p>So for example, in 2005 the actual on-budget deficit was $494bn.  But many of the choices made by the Bush administration and Congress over the years have contributed substantially to this figure.  Spending on Iraq was about $80bn during 2005; all of the various tax <strike>cuts</strike> deferrals over the past five years cost about $211bn in 2005; specific decisions to increase defense spending over the past five years, excluding the costs of the war in Iraq, cost about $142bn in 2005; legislative changes to various entitlement programs cost about $32bn in 2005; and specific changes made to non-defense discretionary spending over the past five years cost about $49bn in 2005. </p>
<p>If none of these deliberate changes to taxes and spending had happened – in other words, if tax laws had remained the same as they were in Clinton’s last year in office, discretionary spending had simply grown at the rate of inflation, Iraq had not been invaded, and entitlement programs had remained unchanged by new legislation – then the federal budget balance would have followed the top-most blue line instead of the bottom-most red line.  Rather than a budget deficit of $494bn in 2005, the federal government would have run a surplus of $18bn. Rather than facing a future of massive and growing deficits as far as the eye can see, the US would be enjoying the prospect of being able pay down some of its national debt in preparation for the looming retirement costs of the baby boomers.  </p>
<p>(If you’re worried that this analysis omits the positive revenue feedback effects of the tax cuts, you’re quite right – but as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/budgetary-effects-of-bush-tax-cuts.html">I’ve demonstrated before</a>, those feedback effects are really tiny so we can safely ignore them.)</p>
<p>There are two crucial points to take from this picture.  First, the Bush tax cuts are alone responsible for close to half of the Bush administration’s chronic and massive budget problem.  The decision to dramatically increase defense spending, including the war in Iraq, accounts for most of the rest of the problem.  As <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/spending-growth-in-context.html">I’ve emphasized previously,</a> increased non-defense discretionary spending is only a tiny contributor to today’s budget problem.</p>
<p>Second, it is quite clear that the deficit is entirely due to specific decisions made by the Bush administration and Congress.  External, “ungoverned” forces have not caused our budget mess.  That honor belongs entirely to our policy-makers in Washington.</p>

                                <p>My friend <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/05/is_the_lword_re.html">David Altig</a> does his best to defend that speech from Karl Rove that we attacked <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/bush-economy-by-karl-rove.html">here</a>.  David’s defense of Mr. Rove goes like this – the growth rate of real GDP and employment started to slow in late 2000, which is factually true.  </p>
<p>At the risk of repeating myself, let me kindly suggest why this defense really does not justify the often heard claims that the recession started before Bush took office by copying my second comment to David’s post:<br />
<blockquote>As I re-read your evidence for a &#8220;downturn&#8221; that occurred before 2001, I have to cry FOUL. A reduction in the GROWTH RATE of real GDP is not the same thing as a decline in real GDP. I don&#8217;t think any economist would have found it prudent to maintain a growth rate in aggregate demand that was in excess of the growth rate of potential GDP past mid-2000. Unless you believe &#8211; which I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t &#8211; that we were below full employment as of 2000QII, one would have welcomed some slowing of real GDP growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll concede that Rove was more guilty of extreme spinning than lying – given that modern political correctness almost rules out the possibility that anyone is ever guilty of lying no matter how they twist facts in order to deceive.  But I have no clue why a sensible and honest conservative economist like David Altig feels the need to defend the free lunch supply-side spin from this White House.  David?</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Listening to the White House babble about fiscal policy and economic growth, I’m reminded of an incident where my scientist wife told me I was like a small child when it came to visiting doctors and taking medicine.  You see, I hate going to the doctor’s office even when I’m quite ill as I was a few months back.  And I’d much rather eat ice cream than take medicine.  So I really wanted to go to the store and purchase some French vanilla ice cream to ease the pain – to which the wife said “only if you go to the doctor’s office first”.  Fine, I went to see the doctor, stopped by the grocery store, purchased a pint of French vanilla ice cream, ate it, and within a couple of days, I was much better.  So do we have scientific proof that Dreyer’s French vanilla ice cream cures the flu or whatever I had?  After all, the doctor never told me to do anything.  But he wouldn’t as he knows to call the wife, which he did – to which he said my ailment was going to cure itself without medicine.  </p>
<p>So I’m reading some story about our Treas. Sec. who said: “I am confident we will continue to see good progress on the deficit. It is clear now that the president&#8217;s objective of cutting the deficit in half will be met and exceeded ahead of schedule … What the president&#8217;s leadership of the economy has demonstrated is that low tax rates create investment, create jobs, create growth; and now with the surge of revenues we are seeing as a result we can also say that low taxes are consistent with rising federal revenues which of course help bring the deficit down”.</p>
<p>And apparently, Nobel Prize winning Tony Snow told Katie Couric that tax revenues are ahead of projections proving that the 2003 tax cut caused rapid economic growth.  And yes, Dreyer’s French vanilla ice cream was the only reason I’m not still in bed with that flu.  </p>
<p>If anyone had asked me during early 2003 whether the economy would recover from the anemic economic performance of the past couple of years, I would have said yes even if I thought that 2003 tax cut proposal would fail.  In fact, I thought some of the economic forecasts back then were too conservative given the size of the GDP gap.  So MY forecast for GDP growth and tax revenue growth would have been higher than many of those forecasts.  Now if someone had said to me – what if they do pass the 2003 tax cut.  My forecast for growth would have been increased only marginally so my forecast for tax revenue growth would have been lowered.  </p>
<p>Now if you asked my doctor similar questions – he would have told you that I would have recovered from my flu just as fast without the ice cream and my waistline would currently be a little bit smaller.  But what do doctors know?  Time to go buy a whole gallon of Dreyer’s French vanilla ice cream!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Our friend <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/05/treasury-secretary-snow-vs-reality.html">Calculated Risk</a> provides <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1152AP_Snow_Deficit.html">this link</a> to the latest Snow Job from the Sec. of the Treasury.  Alas, reporter Jeannine Aversa does precious little to rebut the free lunch garbage from this White House:<br />
<blockquote>Snow credited the president&#8217;s tax cuts with helping to boost overall economic activity and thus tax receipts as well. Democrats contend that the tax cuts plunged the government&#8217;s balance sheets into red ink and ended four years of budget surpluses from 1998 though 2001. The administration has blamed mostly higher spending to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and spending to combat terrorism within the United States for the budget deficits.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This morning&#8217;s release by the BLS of the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">April Consumer Price Index</a> has put a small scare into the financial markets.  The inflation data showed prices rising surprisingly rapidly, both for energy goods (which was not a surprise), but also for things other than energy.</p>
<p>The annualized inflation rate faced by consumers for all goods other than food and energy (the core rate) over the past six months (November-April) was about 2.8%, which is the highest reading for that inflation measure in five years.  The following chart illustrates.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/cpi_ppi_apr06.jpg"></p>
<p>A slightly different measure of inflation that, like the core measure, also tries to smooth out the volatile ups and downs of the overall CPI, is the <a href="http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/data/mcpipr.cfm">median CPI inflation rate</a>.  Including today&#8217;s new data, the median CPI has risen by 2.8% over the past year.  </p>
<p>Thus the underlying rate of inflation in the US economy right now clearly seems to be trending higher in recent months, and is now pushing 3%.  This is almost certainly higher than the Fed would like it to be, so today&#8217;s data substantially increases the likelihood that the Fed will continue raising interest rates further to try to slow down the economy a bit.  </p>
<p>What makes this much worse (from the Fed&#8217;s point of view) is the decided upward trend in inflation that today&#8217;s report seems to be confirming.  Stopping this upward trend before it goes any further will be a top priority for the Fed over the next few months.  (One should note at this point that one could very reasonably argue that the Fed actually has very little control over what happens to inflation over the next few months, since monetary policy tends to operate with a substantial lag, but that&#8217;s a discussion for another day.)</p>
<p>Participants in the stock and bond markets have reacted strongly to this line of reasoning.</p>
<p>Interest rates have been bid up substantially in the bond markets today, with the 10-year US government bond yield rising from about 5.11% early this morning to 5.17% in the first hour after the release of this report.  The following chart shows the yield on the ten-year bond over the past two days.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/tnx_a51606.jpg"></p>
<p>Naturally, the prospect of the Fed trying to cool the economy with further interest rate increases is not welcome news to the owners of US corporations.  That&#8217;s why the stock markets have reacted rather negatively &#8211; the Dow and S&#038;P500 are both down about 1.5%-2% as of 2pm.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing what one little report about inflation during just one month can do, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

                                <p>Does <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZDc0NjdiMTIzNmNhYmU2MTRhZjIwZjJmYzQ3OTBjZmM=">Jonah Goldberg</a> get anything right?<br />
<blockquote>But emailers are telling me that Tony Snow walloped Helen Thomas in the WH briefing.</p></blockquote>
<p>In case you are wondering if Mr. Snow punched Helen Thomas or beat her in a good old fashion bout of mud wrestling, let me assure you that Jonah’s fantasies went unanswered.  Ms. Thomas was simply asking about the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/05/20060516-4.html">wire tapping controversy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Q The President today denied he&#8217;d ever broken the law in terms of wiretaps. He also indicated that anything that was looked into, any calls, had some sort of foreign aspect either to or from. And he has said he&#8217;s always obeyed the law. Are all of these stories untrue that we&#8217;ve been reading for the last several days that millions of Americans have been wiretapped? <br />MR. SNOW: Well, let&#8217;s <br />Q Are the phone calls turned over to the government? <br />MR. SNOW: Okay, let&#8217;s try to segregate the stories here. What he&#8217;s said about the terror surveillance program is that these are foreign-to-domestic calls and they were all done within the parameters of the law. He has not commented on the <br />Q He, himself, has said he didn&#8217;t obey that law. <br />MR. SNOW: No, he didn&#8217;t. What he said is that he has done everything within the confines of the law. The second thing is, you&#8217;re mentioning a USA Today story about which this administration has no comment. But I would direct you back to the USA Today story itself, and if you analyze what that story said, what did it say? It said there is no wiretapping of individual calls, there is no personal information that is being relayed. There is no name, there is no address, there is no consequence of the calls, there&#8217;s no description of who the party on the other end is. <br />Q Privacy was breached by turning over their phone numbers. <br />MR. SNOW: Well, again, you are jumping to conclusions about a program, the existence of which we will neither confirm, nor deny. <br />Q Why? Don&#8217;t you think the American people have a right to know <br />MR. SNOW: Because &#8212; what&#8217;s interesting is, there seems to be a notion that because the President has talked a little bit about one surveillance program and one matter of intelligence gathering, that somehow we have to tell the entire world we have to make intelligence gathering transparent. Let me remind you, it&#8217;s a war on terror, and there are people &#8212; I guarantee you, al Qaeda does not believe &#8212; <br />Q He doesn&#8217;t have a right to break the law, does he? <br />MR. SNOW: No, the President is not talking about breaking the law. But al Qaeda doesn&#8217;t believe in transparency. What al Qaeda believes in is mayhem, and the President has a constitutional obligation and a heartfelt determination to make sure we fight it. <br />Q to obey the Constitution <br />MR. SNOW: Absolutely right. <br />Q the Fourth Amendment <br />MR. SNOW: Absolutely right, and he believes in obeying it. <br />Martha. <br />Q You might repeat the same thing, but why not declassify this? I mean, the President did talk about the surveillance program a day after The New York Times broke that story. This would seem to affect far more people, and it did sound like the President was confirming that story today. He was answering Terry&#8217;s question &#8212; <br />MR. SNOW: Well, if you go back &#8211; if you go back and you look through what he said, there was a reference to foreign-to-domestic calls. I am not going to stand up here and presume to declassify any kind of program. That is a decision the President has to make. I can&#8217;t confirm or deny it. The President was not confirming or denying. <br />Again, I would take you back to the USA Today story, simply to give you a little context. Look at the poll that appeared the following day. While there was &#8211;part of it said 51 percent of the American people opposed, if you look at when people said, if there is a roster of phone numbers, do you feel comfortable that &#8211; I&#8217;m paraphrasing and I apologize &#8211; but something like 64 percent of the polling was not troubled by it. Having said that, I don&#8217;t want to hug the tar baby of trying to comment on the program &#8211; the alleged program &#8211; the existence of which I can neither confirm nor deny. <br />Q But there are polls that show Americans are very concerned about it. <br />MR. SNOW: The President &#8211; you cannot run a security &#8211; you cannot base national security on poll numbers. As the President of the United States you have to make your own judgments about what is in the nation&#8217;s best interest. <br />Q You just brought it up, though. <br />MR. SNOW: Well, I did bring it up because what you were talking about is how people were concerned about privacy issues, and I tried to relate to you what happened. It was interesting, when people were given the specifics in that story, they did not seem to be terribly troubled. <br />Q We are now. </p></blockquote>
<p>So Snow dodged Ms. Thomas’s questions and when she persisted, he falsely claims the American people don’t care citing polls number and then saying who cares about poll numbers as he plays the national security card.  That’s right – we have to violate the Fourth Amendment and spy on Aunt Bee &#8211; or else Al Qaeda has won.  </p>
<p>I’m sorry Jonah – but Tony Snow showed himself to be as much of a weasel as Scott McClellan.  </p>
<p>Speaking of National Security, the rightwingers over at Human Events have joined with <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=14860">Rabbi Ayerh Spero</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Every time the Democrats “expose” how the administration is fighting the war on terror, Republicans become defensive and hide for cover as if we are doing something wrong. Instead, let the President or the Speaker or Senate Majority Leader offer the following proposition: No more intercepting calls from Al Qaeda. No more detention of captured terrorist suspects. No more detention camps … Let’s point at the Democrats, while the American people are listening, and say: OK, we’ll do it your way. Safety is secondary to whatever Human Rights Watch and the ACLU demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before you decide to fire back that this “Rabbi” is a nut case, check out his <a href="http://www.caucusforamerica.com/opinion.art.php?pID=302">energy proposal</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Drilling in Alaska is Biggest Religious Issue of our Time</p></blockquote>
<p>We have an election coming up in November so expect a lot of this bashing of Democrats on these fake national security concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: National Review’s <a href="http://media.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTFjMjQzYzU0YzRlNGMwZTExMDAxMWQzNTIyMzc3YWY=">Media Blog</a> described Thomas v. Snow as:<br />
<blockquote>Fact-checking Helen Thomas, who falsely alleged that “millions of Americans have been wiretapped.” Snow explained that the USA Today story said nothing about wiretapping, and explained further why he couldn’t comment on the program: “Let me remind you: It’s a war on terror… Al-Qaeda doesn’t believe in transparency.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So a non-denial denial is considered fact checking?  Interesting.  Media Blog continues:<br />
<blockquote>He got tripped up when he started talking about poll numbers. First he used poll numbers to support a point he was making, then he said the president can’t conduct national security based on poll numbers. Again, discounting for misleading poll questions, the poll numbers have indicated support for this idea. He should not have conceded that the program is unpopular.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that’s rich – if a poll does not support your spin – call its questions “misleading”.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>While <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/05/rove_the_bush_e.html">Mark Thoma</a> has a few words about the partisan garbage Karl Rove delivered to the <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/05/the_bush_economy.html">American Enterprise Institute</a>, let me start here:<br />
<blockquote>The economy itself began slowing in the third quarter of 2000 as GDP declined by an annual rate of 0.5 percent. And all of this took place before George W. Bush set foot in the Oval Office.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rove fails to admit that during the fourth quarter of 2000, real GDP increased by an annual rate of 2.1% and that for the entire year, real GDP rose by 3.7% &#8211; which just happens to be the average rate of increase for the Clinton tenure in office.  Compare that to the meager performance of real GDP during the 2001 to 2005 period.  Employment growth – as measured by the payroll survey – was very strong during the Clinton years with employment continuing until March 2001.  Employment growth since Bush took office has been pathetic.  And before any of the household survey freaks jump in, let me remind them that the employment-population ratio (from the household survey) stood at 64.4% when Bush took office but was only 63% as of April 2006.</p>
<p>Rove describes Bush’s economic policies thusly:<br />
<blockquote>And he believes that economic growth is created largely on the economy&#8217;s supply side. The best tax cuts create incentives for people to work and businesses to produce and companies to invest. President Bush doesn&#8217;t believe government creates wealth. He understands that&#8217;s done by American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs. His economic policies, then, are tied to a view of human beings that understands the role of incentives in shaping behavior. There are three important elements of these policies that I&#8217;d like to talk about today: the tax system, trade liberalization and budget discipline. The president believes when the economy falters, tax cuts will lead to economic prosperity. This reflects a deep faith in individual citizens; in their energy and common sense and capacity to make wise decisions. His view of free trade is grounded in the knowledge that American producers and workers can compete and win internationally as long as the rules are fair. And an emphasis on a responsible federal budget reflects the president&#8217;s belief that, while government should actively perform its core functions, it should not impede the efforts of individual citizens and enterprises to create jobs, wealth and economic opportunity. Let me deal briefly with each one of these three: taxes, trade and spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>The premise that Bush has promoted a free trade agenda is a JOKE.  So let’s turn to fiscal policy where Bush has pretended to give us our money back – but rather than cut government spending, he has allowed it to increase as a share of GDP.  Of course, the Bush cheerleaders wish to tell you that despite the fact that national savings has declined since 2000, Bush’s economic policies have somehow led to more long-term growth.  Of course, the facts don’t support this spin.  </p>
<p>But Karl wants the Bush Administration to get credit for a wonderful labor market:<br />
<blockquote>The American economy has created more jobs than all the countries in the Euro zone and Japan combined, and our economy is growing today faster than that of any major industrialized nation in the world. It grew at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the first quarter. It added more than 5.2 million jobs in the last two and a half years. Employment is at near all-time high. Claims for unemployment insurance are at a five-year low. The unemployment rate is 4.7 percent; well below the average for each of the last three decades.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I guess Karl’s fuzzy math says 63% is greater than 64.4%?!</p>
<p>Let’s face it – George W. Bush sent Karl Rove to the AEI to flat out lie.  But then what’s new?</p>
