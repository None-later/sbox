                                                                    </div>

                                <blockquote><p>NEW YORK, Feb. 7 /PRNewswire/ &#8212; The Securities Law Firm of Klayman &#038; Toskes, P.A. (&#8220;K&#038;T&#8221;)(http://www.nasd-law.com) announced today that it continues to investigate sales of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) from Merrill Lynch (NYSE: MER) and UBS (NYSE: UBS) to institutional investors. These firms sold billions of dollars in CDOs to investors around the world. Some of the CDOs which sustained heavy losses include Norma CDO I, Centre Square CDO, South Coast Funding V CDO, Mezzanine ABS CDO, and the Tabs CDO.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, federal prosecutors and the SEC stated that they were looking into whether Wall Street brokerage firms, like Merrill Lynch and UBS, &#8220;deliberately misvalued, or &#8216;mismarked,&#8217; massive holdings of mortgage securities.&#8221; Further, the U.S. Justice Department is looking into whether brokerage firms committed fraud in their &#8220;originating, packaging and selling mortgage-related products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently, K&#038;T is investigating how Merrill Lynch and UBS marketed their CDO products, and whether the brokerage firms properly disclosed the risks of the products to its investors. The issue of whether Merrill Lynch and UBS over-stated and inflated the value of their CDO products is rapidly becoming a common theme in the investigation. Further, K&#038;T is looking into whether the CDOs were suitable for the institutions, municipalities, fund of funds, and pension funds that invested in the products through Merrill Lynch and UBS.</p>
<p>K&#038;T has already filed numerous arbitration claims on behalf of investors who lost millions in the CDO market. If you are an investor in CDOs that were packaged and/or underwritten by Merrill Lynch and UBS, or if you have information relevant to our investigation, please contact Lawrence L. Klayman, Esquire or Steven D. Toskes, Esquire of Klayman &#038; Toskes, P.A., at 888-997- 9956. You may also visit us on the web at http://www.nasd-law.com.</p>
<p>Klayman &#038; Toskes, P.A., an experienced and nationally recognized securities litigation law firm, continues its representation of investors throughout the world in securities arbitration and litigation matters against major Wall Street brokerage firms.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/marketsmag/mm_1007_story2.html">Bloomberg Magazine, in &#8220;Unsafe Havens&#8221;</a>. (Hat tip to <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/09/some-money-market-funds-have-large.html">Naked Capitalism</a>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>reports that money market funds run by Bank of America Corp., Credit Suisse Group, Fidelity Investments and Morgan Stanley owned over $6 billion of CDOs with subprime debt in June.</p>
<p>The reason this is a serious issue is that money market funds have a $1 NAV, meaning &#8220;net asset value&#8221; rule. The funds are required by the SEC to invest conservatively. In practice, they always to maintain principal value. But as the article explains, this sort of investment puts the funds at risk of breaching the $1 NAV requirement.</p>
<p>What this article tells us, in effect, is that investors weren&#8217;t completely nuts to have dumped money market funds for Treasuries in August. Of course, they probably should have called the fund manager first, since most large fund management firms, such as Vanguard, correctly see this sort of paper as in appropriate for a money market fund.</p>
<p>The article is quite long but very much worth reading in its entirety; we&#8217;ve excepted the juicy bits. From Bloomberg Magazine:</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to most investors, some of the largest money market funds today are putting part of their cash into one of the riskiest debt investments in the world: collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgage loans&#8230;.</p>
<p>Money market funds with total assets of $300 billion have invested in subprime debt this year&#8230;.</p>
<p>Under SEC rules, money market managers must invest in securities with &#8220;minimal credit risks.&#8221; Joseph Mason, a finance professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a former economist at the U.S. Treasury Department, says subprime debt in money market funds is far from safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;This creates tremendous risk for today&#8217;s money market investors,&#8221; says Mason, who wrote an 84-page report on CDOs this year. &#8220;Right now, I&#8217;m not comfortable investing anything in CDOs.&#8221;&#8230;.</p>
<p>On Aug. 9, BNP Paribas SA, France&#8217;s biggest bank by market value, froze withdrawals on three investment funds with assets of 2 billion euros because the bank couldn&#8217;t find a way to value its U.S. subprime bonds and other assets. CDOs aren&#8217;t bought and sold on exchanges and their trading has little transparency&#8230;.</p>
<p>Bruce Bent, who in 1970 created the first money market fund, The Reserve Fund, says no money market fund should invest in subprime debt.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s inappropriate,&#8221; Bent, 70, says. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t have a place in money market funds. When I created the first money market fund, I said you have to have immediate liquidity, safety and a reasonable rate of return. You also have to have a situation where you&#8217;re not giving people headline risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investors have sought safety during the subprime meltdown by moving their holdings to U.S. Treasuries and money market funds. On Aug. 8, just after the Bear Stearns hedge funds filed for bankruptcy protection, U.S. money market fund total assets reached a record high of $2.66 trillion, with investors pouring $49 billion into such funds in one week, according to the ICI.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reader Jack asked about money disappearing. Some was pure vapor wares in a bidding war for promises on ROI. Other money came from what were safe havens of money markets, municipal bonds, and other financial vehicles that were supposed to be only steady and safe.</p>
<p>Springfield MA sued and won their $14 million from Merryl Lynch based on their agent&#8217;s inappropriate behavior by disregarding the town&#8217;s mandate of investment vehicles.</p>

I hope you enjoyed what this city has to offer as well as the weather.  It had been clear with highs near 50 or more until today with the likely topping 60 but rain seems on the horizon.  I mention this as <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTdiOWE0YWQwMTg4YTlhOThmNDdkNTFmNTg1MjBkZDM=">Thomas Sowell</a> thought you’d be facing this:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has almost become something of a joke when some “global warming” conference has to be cancelled because of a snowstorm or bitterly cold weather.</p></blockquote>
<p>Too bad he did not <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/thomas-sowell-should-not-become-weather.html">check the forecast</a> before he wrote his little rant.</p>
<p>Sowell also predicted that the press would ignore this group of global warming deniers.  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/03/04/despite-broad-coverage-of-global-warming-deniers-conference-right-wing-slams-media-for-ignoring-it">Ali of Think Progress</a> says this Sowell prediction did not pan out so well either!</p>

<blockquote><p>IF you’ve stood in line at a farmers’ market recently, you know that the local food movement is thriving, to the point that small farmers are having a tough time keeping up with the demand.<br />But consumers who would like to be able to buy local fruits and vegetables not just at farmers’ markets, but also in the produce aisle of their supermarket, will be dismayed to learn that the federal government works deliberately and forcefully to prevent the local food movement from expanding. And the barriers that the United States Department of Agriculture has put in place will be extended when the farm bill that House and Senate negotiators are working on now goes into effect.<br />As a small organic vegetable producer in southern Minnesota, I know this because my efforts to expand production to meet regional demand have been severely hampered by the Agriculture Department’s commodity farm program. As I’ve looked into the politics behind those restrictions, I’ve come to understand that this is precisely the outcome that the program’s backers in California and Florida have in mind: they want to snuff out the local competition before it even gets started.<br />&#8230;<br />Who pays the price for this senselessness? Certainly I do, as a Midwestern vegetable farmer. But anyone trying to do what I do on, say, wheat acreage in the Dakotas, or rice acreage in Arkansas would face the same penalties. Local and regional fruit and vegetable production will languish anywhere that the commodity program has influence.<br />Ultimately of course, it is the consumer who will pay the greatest price for this — whether it is in the form of higher prices I will have to charge to absorb the government’s fines, or in the form of less access to the kind of fresh, local produce that the country is crying out for.<br />Farmers need the choice of what to plant on their farms, and consumers need more farms like mine producing high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables to meet increasing demand from local markets — without the federal government actively discouraging them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>  MG points out I missed this part of the article&#8230;I did in my scanning.  Thanks.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The commodity farm program effectively forbids farmers who usually grow corn or the other four federally subsidized commodity crops (soybeans, rice, wheat and cotton) from trying fruit and vegetables. Because my watermelons and tomatoes had been planted on “corn base” acres, the Farm Service said, my landlords were out of compliance with the commodity program. </p>
<p>I’ve discovered that typically, a farmer who grows the forbidden fruits and vegetables on corn acreage not only has to give up his subsidy for the year on that acreage, he is also penalized the market value of the illicit crop, and runs the risk that those acres will be permanently ineligible for any subsidies in the future. (The penalties apply only to fruits and vegetables — if the farmer decides to grow another commodity crop, or even nothing at all, there’s no problem.)&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/kudlow-on-reagans-strong-dollar-policy.html">Cactus</a> brought to our attention the latest insanity from <a href="http://kudlow.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Zjk4MTcxZWViMjE1ZGI3OWEwY2Q0NmYwNzcwYjI3NWI=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> but I don’t think this is the main criticism:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Federal Reserve’s Major Currency Index for January 1981 was: 96.023. In January of 1989, it was 90.5499.</p></blockquote>
<p>As our first graph shows, the dollar did appreciate significantly from early 1981 through mid 1985.  What I find amazing is that Kudlow thinks this was a good idea then and it’s a good idea now:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Sen. John McCain wants to run as a candidate of change, and if he’s truly interested in distancing himself from President Bush, he should reverse the declining fortunes of the Bush wartime dollar. America’s prestige is on the line.  Right now the greenback is in virtual freefall. It’s a disorderly drop. As a result, U.S. inflation rates are rising across the board as the global commodity boom leaks into higher domestic inflation.  Inflation is the cruelest tax of all. It robs consumer and wage-earner purchasing power. It erodes business profits. It reduces the real worth of investor portfolios.  It’s also the single biggest cause of recession, and it may well be tipping the economy into negative territory. For the first time in a decade I’ve become genuinely worried about inflation. Over the last year and a half, inflation has climbed from 1.5 percent to nearly 4.5 percent, and in the past three to four months it has trended sharply higher.  But there’s another side of the dollar story that’s equally important. The falling U.S. greenback has become a symbol of American decline. Folks are making fun of the dollar. Our enemies around the world are pointing to the unreliable dollar as evidence of American weakness. It’s as though the administration’s neglect of the dollar is “peso-izing” or “Latin-Americanizing” the greenback &#8230; For patriotic reasons alone it is time to reverse the decline of the dollar. A strong dollar should be emblematic of a strong America and a strong defense.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prestige?  Patriotism?  I guess if one is as clueless about economics as Lawrence Kudlow appears to be, then maybe all one has is prestige and patriotism as excuses for a really bad policy prescription.  Kudlow’s line about inflation being the cause of recessions is idiotic.  Now it is a lack of aggregate demand.  </p>
<p>Kudlow is advocating contractionary monetary policy, which will have two adverse effects on aggregate demand.  One is to drive up real interest rates which will discourage both business and residential investment demand.  But the main on point transmission channel is the appreciation of the dollar that Kudlow wants, which would lower net export demand.  Let me address this by doing two things.  First – I ask you to listen to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=03&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=trade_and_the_dollar_what_is_s">Dean Baker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>USA Today ran a  piece today discussing trade policy in the context of lost manufacturing jobs in Ohio. It treats the loss of these jobs as a mystery, with some experts saying that trade played a role and others denying it. More importantly, the piece never discusses the high dollar, which is the most important reason that the United States has lost jobs through trade … The other huge flaw in this article is the failure to mention the value of the dollar. The dollar rose by close to 30 percent against the currencies of our trading partners in the late nineties. This was the main cause of the explosion in our trade deficit.   If the dollar rises by 30 percent it has approximately the same impact on trade as imposing a 30 percent tariff on all goods exported from the United States and providing a 30 percent subsidy for all goods imported from the country. It is virtually inconceivable that the United States will be able to reduce its trade deficit to a sustainable level unless the dollar falls considerably further against the currencies of our trading partners.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean is very critical of the strong dollar policies from the 1990’s onwards as he realizes that a strong dollar lowers net exports, which is one component of aggregate demand.  But Kudlow was praising the strong dollar policies of the early 1980’s.  So our second graph shows real exports (blue line) and real imports (real line – all figures in 2000$) from 1981 to 1985.  Notice that real exports failed to grow during this period while real imports grew after we recovered from the 1982 recession.  The dollar appreciation and its negative impact on net export demand in fact was one of the reasons why the 1982 recession was so deep. </p>
<p>Now Cactus is right – the dollar did devalue during Reagan’s second term.  Some of us believe that was a good thing as it temporarily reversed the deterioration of the current account deficit.  I would hope policy makers realize that what Kudlow is advocating would not only reduce aggregate demand making the recession worse but would also have negative consequences for the current account.  But maybe John McCain will be stupid enough to think this idiocy from Kudlow makes sense.</p>
<p>Let me close by saying we may indeed be facing some Latin-Americanizing of the dollar but here the problem is not with the proper use of monetary policy to moderate business cycles.  The problem lies in the fiscal fiasco created by Bush’s tax cuts – both of which Kudlow supports.  If the next President is smart, he or she will abandon the policies recommended by the likes of Kudlow.  But then John McCain doesn’t seem to get fiscal policy either.</p>

                                <p>Reader TinMan sends a rant on&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>the “Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005” and how it relates to what drug companies would consider “progress” – i.e. taking prescription drugs into the OTC arena.</p>
<p>My current bout of angst is due to my requirement (need, addiction?) of Zyrtec with a decongestant (Zyrtec-D). Now Zyrtec has recently gone OTC, thank goodness for the FDA, and that puts me into a bind when it comes to prescription meds in that this particular compound is now no longer covered and all the requisite ‘recordkeeping’ required for processing prescription paperwork/insurance filings.</p>
<p>Adding to the misery is the fact that the decongestant formulation contains pseudoephedrine (PSE) which, as we ALL know is the main precursor to methamphetamine, is now OTC but “behind the counter”.</p>
<p>In reading through this act, which by-the-by was (from what I could tell) tacked on to the renewal of the Patriot Act (gack!), the federal requirements/limitations on the manufacture and sale of PSE-containing products dictates not only how retailers are allowed to sell but including additional record keeping requirements in addition to stipulating how the controlled chemical’s are packaged by the manufacturers!</p>
<p>What’s turned from a simple, less than 5 minute process of “I’m here to pick up my prescription for Fetch”, swipe my credit card, sign their ‘prescription receipt’ logbook, and I’m gone to this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Me: I need 3 boxes of 24-count Zrytec-D (using the monthly limit of 9 grams in a single visit; 120mg/pill, 24 pills/box).</p>
<p>Pharmacy Tech (PT): I can only sell you 2.  I don’t make the laws sir. (note – this has put a requirement on pharmacies to employ PTs now since they’re the lowest-authorized employee allowed to sell ‘controlled’ substances which PSE now is; oh, and there’s a daily limit of 3.6 grams regardless of the monthly limit)</p>
<p>Me: Fine, 2 boxes then.</p>
<p>PT: Can I see some ID (I hand her my passport – specifically don’t want/need my address there)</p>
<p>PT: Address?</p>
<p>Me: Let me do that (I write in my work address &#038; sign)</p>
<p>Me: Nothing like inconveniencing the people who really need the medication…</p>
<p>Pharmacist: That’s true…and you’re not the only one.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, I finally purchase my “OTC” meds to the tune of $47.98 (for 48 pills!!!!) and go to take one when I get to work: two boxes, each with 24 INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED PILLS!!!</p>
<p>What has this world come to!?</p>
<p>We go from purchasing a single bottle of prescription medication (60 pills) for a $30 co-pay (total cost around $90 based upon what “savings” I was being shown) with the bottle being recyclable all in less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>To 2 paper boxes each stuffed with 24 individually plastic &#038; paper wrapped pills for nearly $50 that practically screams of the TSA performing pharmacy sales!</p>
<p>Not only excessively costly for the consumer (when compared to it being a covered med) but then the overall impact to the environment for packaging &#038; disposal of the packaging once used.</p>
<p>“Gotta slow down these tweakers in their labs ya know…”</p>
<p>All to combat an ‘epidemic’ that no amount of law enforcement seems capable of stopping.</p>
<p>I guess I’ve never been exposed to the epidemic (lived in Dallas/Fort Worth for the past 12 years, now in the NYC area) so I don’t necessarily know the ramifications of meth but still.  Square that with a family of 6 (4 children) who all happen to get sick at the same time and you’re left to wonder “Who gets to suffer tonight since the government wouldn’t let me purchase enough medications to soothe everyone…”</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The rant above was by Reader TinMan.  Your thoughts?</p>

                                <p>OPEC is not riding to the rescue. According to a NYT <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/business/AP-OPEC-Meeting.html">piece</a>, OPEC is satisfied that the world has enough oil, even though the price of oil adjusted for inflation hit an all time high: $103.76 versus $38 in 1980 &#8220;at the height of the Iran hostage crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>OPEC apparently believes that the U.S. economic downturn will be enough to lessen the price of oil. We shall see. I wonder how much of a downturn we need? According the <a href="http://www.energybulletin.net/39169.html">Energy Bulletin</a>, China&#8217;s newly acquired taste for oil is part of what is escalating the price:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Double-digit demand growth in China is a fundamental driver of the oil price. The United States and China are locked into a spiraling mutual dependency in which the People&#8217;s Republic manufactures consumer goods and Americans buy them. China&#8217;s share of world oil consumption is now about 9% and rising yearly.</p></blockquote>
<p>As David Cohen, the writer of the Bulletin piece, so exquisitely points out, China is faced with a real dilemma:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Wen Jiabao continues the price freeze to tame inflation, he risks fuel shortages as subsidized demand spirals out of control. Supply insufficiencies force the Chinese to import more oil and refined products, which drives up world crude prices. Higher oil prices mean lower crack spreads for Chinese refiners who already operate at a loss.</p></blockquote>
<p>On another front, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/opinion/04herbert.html?hp">Bob Herbert</a> has an interesting piece about price of the Iraq war. According to Joe Stiglitz, the war that has no end already will cost us around $3 trillion.</p>
<p>Then Nouriel Roubini says that the subprime disaster may well be in excess of $1 trillion. And, all expect the FED to cut rates further, not that the cuts already have eased the plight of homeowners. In fact, quite the opposite: Rates went down; mortgage rates went up. Banks needed the cash and were quite eager to recoup their losses any way they could. As I pointed out in a prior piece, &#8220;The Latest Banking Scam: Which Dog to Kick,&#8221; banks are now sneakily increasing overdraft fees.</p>
<p>On yet another front, England finally had to nationalize Northern Rock&#8211;until it got its legs back. Then, of course, once the government sets its books aright, back into private hands it will go. Yes, you heard me. The plan is to turn it eventually back into private hands.</p>
<p>Some are asking for more transparency, more regulations. Dream on.</p>
<p>No OPEC cavalry riding to the rescue.</p>
<p>So here we are, between a rock and a hard place: Oil continuing its relentless rise. Inflation is on the prowl. And trillions are being sucked from the economy either through misadventure or greed.</p>
<p>After a while, I just have to ask: Who in hell is running this show? Anybody in charge?</p>

                                <p>Can anyone recommend a wireless router?  Anything other than a D-Link product?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tired of D-Link.  I&#8217;ve owned two of them, and its always the same nonsense.  A power outage, or someone re-arranges the wires, and I have to spend 25 minutes getting the connection re-activated.  Its a matter of hit or miss pressing the same button over and over and over and over while trying to see if the browser finally comes up.  (I don&#8217;t need a wireless router myself &#8211; but the Ex-GF likes to have a wireless connection to her Mac.) Last night it got worse.  We had some electrical work done in the hovel.  I spent an hour trying to get the router up with no success.  This morning I&#8217;ve been trying and trying.  At this point I don&#8217;t care any more.  Or rather, I do.  I&#8217;m having very uncharitable thoughts about D-Link for wasting my time.  </p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re wondering why I don&#8217;t call customer service &#8211; I&#8217;ve called D-Link customer service in the past and have come to believe the primary gain to calling them is adding 30 minutes to the amount of time it takes to get the thing  operational again.  I don&#8217;t need those kinds of benefits.</p>
<p>I finally connected this computer directly to the modem, but keeping it that way is not an option.  I don&#8217;t want to waste any more time.  Can anyone suggest a router?  Anything other than D-Link?</p>

                                <p>In<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/yes-virginia-rich-are-different.html"> this post</a>, Bruno commented and posted <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/250.html">this link </a>to reference this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2005, the top 1 percent of tax returns paid 39.4 percent of all federal individual income taxes and earned 21.2 percent of adjusted gross income, both of which are significantly higher than 2004 when the top 1 percent earned 19 percent of AGI and paid 36.9 percent of federal individual income taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>I assume that the purpose of reporting the data in this way is to invoke a natural sense of fairness to people. That being that one&#8217;s share of B should reflect their share of A. That B became “significantly higher” suggests some unfairness. Oh for the humanity of it.</p>
<p>The report could have reported that the top 1%&#8217;s tax burden in dollars was 20% higher, however their share of income was 21.8% higher. Now is this fair? Is this fair of the report to have noted the rise of both income and taxes paid in a manor that makes the top1% look as if they are getting unfair treatment and not show that the bottom 99% &#8216;s income only went up 6.2% but their dollars paid in income taxes went up 7.9%?</p>
<p>How fair is this? All of it? 1980 to 2005 all? Adjusted incomes all?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out this report had a link to an exel file of their data. Perfect! As a dutiful AB&#8217;er I took it as my charge to see what that data was really showing. Turns out since 1980, the messing with the tax rates has had some strange effects. Fairness is missing in all of it, even the vaunted Clinton era.</p>
<p>Look at this chart. Notice how the income for the bottom 99% is continuously falling away from the total income. Of course, you can&#8217;t miss the top 1% line. Up, up and away (in my beautiful, my beautiful balloon&#8230;)</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/R81ZwzVNCoI/AAAAAAAAAG4/hdPd9jQ6KKE/s1600-h/Total+adj+income+1980+to+2005.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/R81ZwzVNCoI/AAAAAAAAAG4/hdPd9jQ6KKE/s400/Total+adj+income+1980+to+2005.JPG" border="0"></a>The next chart is of total taxes paid. Notice the similarity. The rising share of total income that becomes income taxes is certainly a function of one&#8217;s rising share of total income.

Look between 1991 and 2000 at the bottom 99%. Do you see that it is rising? This is a period that we are suppose to be considering a symbol of progressive taxation and yet income taxes paid as a percentage of income is rising for the bottom 99% while it is descending for the top 1%. The actual percentages for the 99%&#8217;ers start in 1992 at 10.9 and peaks in 2000 at 12.1%. Where as the top 1% go from 25.05% 1992 to 28.87% 1996 to 27.45 2000. </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Update, forgot these 2 paragraphs:</div>
<div><em>Is this what we are to consider progressive taxation? No it is not. The covers blown. We have not had a progressive tax adjustment since we started playing with the code with Reagan. And it hurt more knowing that it was decidedly unprogressive during a term when the president ran as a progressive. It hurts even more because Clinton&#8217;s term is being pointed to as a time to emulate. A rise of share of income to the top 1% of 6 points in 8 years and now we see that the bottom got buffaloed in the income tax department too. </em></div>
<div><em></em> </div>
<div><em><br />The highest total of income collected as income taxes in this series of data was 1981 at 15.76%. Being that Reagan hadn&#8217;t started blowing the budget, this could reasonably be considered the amount of money we have to pay to keep the budget in good shape. (That is assuming all other taxes stay the same as 1981. They didn&#8217;t.) But NOOOOOOOOOOO. We see us paying less each year until 1990. Only 23.25% was paid to take care of our house that year. The top 1% paid 25.1% of the house needs out of 14% of the income. The rest of us paid 74.9% of the house needs out of 86% of the income. </em></div>
<div> </div>
<div>By 2000 we are paying 15.26% of our total income for the needs of the house. The top 1% is paying 37.4% of the need out of 20.8% of the income. The rest of us are paying 62.6 % of the needs out of 79.2% of the income. Ok, I guess there was some progressiveness here. </div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>But!</strong> In 1992 the income per capita for the top 1% was $152,743 and $11,055 for the rest. By 2000 it&#8217;s $343,357 and $15,999 respectively. Now I ask you, is this progressive? A 124.8% increase for the 1%&#8217;ers and only a 44.7% increase for the rest of us. Remember, this is during the Clinton years!</div>
<div>Since that time, the house has really been starving for attention. In 2005, the year the top is or is not getting screwed (I think the numbers show they are not) we collectively only paid 12.45% of our income to the house needs. We have never paid so little. Well, except for 2003 when we paid 11.9%. Which just happens to be somewhere between the 1999 and 2000 percentage for the share of income paid by the bottom 99%. Yes folks, currently we are trying to fund the house on the same percentage of income that only the bottom 99% use to pay. Or, put another way, we are funding a 304.2% (BEA table 3.1 1981 to 2005) increase in house needs on only a 234.3% increase in payments to the house while the total source has increased 319.2%. That&#8217;s 260.2% (awfully close to the house needs rise) for the bottom 99 and 970.3% for the poor souls burdened with 39% of the house needs. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Let me be blunt: This all sucks. Just plain sick and tired of having my head played sucks.</div>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2008/03/disingenuous-begging-by-paulson.html">Morality vs. Business Decisions</a></p>
<p>But this is not about morality at all. This is about business decisions. See Moral Obligations Of Walking Away and The Business of Walking Away for more on the morality vs. business decisions.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, banks made business decisions to lend money to people to buy houses that banks knew people could not afford. Banks also made business decisions to lend with no money down. Banks knew there were risk to these strategies but they took the risks anyway.Those were bad business decision for banks. Banks, not taxpayers should pay the price.</p>
<p>Paulson is now begging people to do something that may not be in their best interest to do. My recommendation is simple. If it benefits you to walk away, then walk away.</p>
<p>Note too that walking away is not one sided. Banks and businesses &#8220;walk away&#8221; all the time when it suits their best interest. Deals are being broken as I type and banks are paying breakup fees. See Businesses Advised To Walk Away for more on this topic.</p>
<p>The &#8220;breakup fee&#8221; for homeowners walking away is a bad mark on their credit report and loss of their down payment. In many cases the down payment was zero. Banks have only themselves to blame for setting the breakup fee too low.</p>
<p>Bubbles, greed, and bailouts, not walking away, are the real moral hazards. And if enough people do walk away (forced or unforced), banks will be more careful about who they lend to next time and what the breakup fees (down payments) need to be. If and when banks (and the Fed) are more careful, fewer bubbles will get blown, and the better off we all will be.</p></blockquote>
