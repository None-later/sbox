                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080325/social_security.html?.v=9">AP</a> turns itself into Steno Sue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Government Benefit Programs in Trouble &#8211; Trustees Project Serious Financial Challenges for Social Security and Medicare: Trustees for the government&#8217;s two biggest benefit programs warned that Social Security and Medicare are facing &#8220;enormous challenges&#8221; with the threat to Medicare&#8217;s solvency far more severe. The trustees, issuing their once-a-year analysis, said the resources in the Social Security trust fund will be depleted by 2041.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I first read this, I thought – what a load of crap.  OK, I should back up from the profanity and explain what I mean.  Let me do this with a personal analogy.  As my kids were growing up, I saved a lot to fund their college education.  Over the past five years, I’ve paid a lot to pay for their college education so my bank account reserves did decline over the past five years.  But at no point was I not able to buy groceries.  Why?  Because I still have a steady stream of income.  Maybe I should just turn this microphone over to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=03&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=bush_appointees_use_trustee_po">Dean Baker</a> for more:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was nothing in these reports suggesting any qualitative deterioration in the financial state of these programs compared to their situation last year. The trustees claim, reported in this article, &#8220;that financial pressures will begin much sooner when the programs begin paying out more in benefits each year than they collect in payroll taxes&#8221; is simply a lie.  Under the law, both programs have distinct streams of funding in the form of a dedicated payroll tax. They have accumulated a large surplus from this tax which is available to be used to cover projected shortfalls in the decades ahead (Medicare already faces a shortfall). The fact that the expenses exceed revenue for a specific year makes no difference whatsoever for either program, as long as it has money in the trust fund to cover this shortfall.  President Bush&#8217;s trustees are either ignorant of the laws governing the operation of Social Security and Medicare or they deliberately misled the public, presumably to gain support for cutting these programs. Either way, the inaccuracy of their assertions is extremely newsworthy.</p></blockquote>
<p>But AP’s Martin Crutsinger does not challenge the inaccuracy of the Administration’s claim.  Rather he just reports them as if they were true.</p>
<p>In the meantime, check out <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/look-and-feel-15-years-younger">Paul Krugman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>the difference between projected outlays and projected revenues over the next 75 years. This is the thing that’s supposed to get steadily worse as time goes by, as the 75-year window contains ever fewer years in which the baby boomers are in the work force, paying payroll taxes, and ever more years when the boomers are out of the work force and collecting benefits.  In fact, however, the actuarial balance has been improving rather than worsening. It’s now better than it’s been since 1993. What this tells us is that projections made in the mid-to-late 1990s were, in the light of subsequent revisions, way too pessimistic. Moral: Social Security’s financial problem is relatively minor. It doesn’t deserve the emphasis it receives from most pundits.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Tom Maguire leaves the following canard as a comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, as I diligently saved for the college fund my wife spent all of it, and more, on nice clothes and fancy vacations, so in fact, our net family &#8220;savings&#8221; never existed and we have had to take out a second mortgage on the house. Now, however, I am actually writing the checks to cover college tuition, so either my wife will have to cut back elsewhere, or we will need to apply for a third round of financing on our home.</p></blockquote>
<p>My reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tom &#8220;Just One Minute&#8221; Maguire used one of my analogies. But Tom missed a crucial element. I&#8217;m divorced from my ex-wife. And she did try this stunt with a credit card she took out in my name. Guess what Tom? The credit card company realized that they never could bill me for her fraud.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tom?  Your analogy really is old and has been demolished many times.  Why one would  bother with this old canard is beyond me.</p>

                                <p>Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why would anyone straight out of high school join the Army Reserve or the National Guard right now?  Consider &#8211; if you want to serve in a combat zone, you would go ahead and sign up for the regular Army, as it increases your likelihood of a combat zone posting.  On the other hand, if you specifically do not want to end up in a combat zone, well, the Army Reserve or the National Guard is not the right place for you either.  One weekend a month, two weeks a year has gone by the wayside a while ago.</p>

                                <p>Tanta at <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">CR</a>takes a different tack on BS and Stampf at Wells Fargo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yves at naked capitalism had a <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/03/bear-did-fed-and-treasury-get-too.html">good post</a> yesterday on the infamous Bear Stearns <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/03/jpmorgan-offers-10-per-share-for-bear.html">Ten Buck Rechuck</a>, that I think needs repeating:</p>
<p>According to Sorkin, the $2 price for Bear was the Fed&#8217;s and Treasury&#8217;s idea; JP Morgan was prepared to pay more, but they nixed the idea, saying they did not like the &#8220;optics&#8221; of the deal. The implication is that the officials overstepped their bounds. That is a pretty outrageous spin when the government is putting up taxpayer money. Had it been an option, the Fed should have nationalized Bear. It was going to declare bankruptcy Monday if there was no deal; its shareholders would have been wiped out. Why am I so confident of this view? If bondholders, as rumored, were buying shares to make sure the JPM deal went through (and thus would take losses on their stock purchases when the deal closed), that meant that they thought their bonds were worth well under 100 cents on the dollar in a bankruptcy. Shareholders are subordinate to bondholders, so equity owners would have gotten zilch.I can think of a host of reasons, however, why the Fed did not go the nationalization route, the biggest being that it lacked clear authority (it couldn&#8217;t declare Bear to be insolvent, as it could a member bank). And letting Bear fail (and having accounts frozen) was what the Fed was trying to avoid, so letting it fail and then seizing control (even assuming it could do that) was never an option. No doubt, the central bank also did not want to assume administrative control of an entity that it had never regulated (ie, its supervisors had never kicked its tires) that dealt actively in markets in which the Fed has little expertise. Even in an orderly liquidation scenario, that it a lot to take on.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/business/25sorkin.html?_r=1&#038;ref=business&#038;oref=slogin">Sorkin</a> nevertheless argues that the Fed did Bear a dirty because:</p>
<p>&#8230;..the night that Bear signed the original bid, the Fed opened what’s known as the discount window to companies like Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers — oh, yes, and to Bear, too. Except that the Fed didn’t tell Bear that it planned to open the window when it was signing its deal with JPMorgan.This verges on being revisionist history. First and most important, the discount window was opened to keep the panic about Bear from spreading to other firms, most notably Lehman. It almost certainly would not have happened then if Bear was not on the verge of imploding. Remember, a mere week and a day ago, there was pervasive fear that the wheels were about to come off the financial system, particularly if counterparties started getting leery of dealing with Lehman.Moreover, usage of the new discount window the first week was light due to worries about stigma. If Bear had gone and used it aggressively, it may well have reinforced rather than allayed fears about the trading firm&#8217;s health. If other firms continued to refuse to deal with Bear, its collapse was assured. There was a very real possibility that even if Bear had remained independent and used the window, its bankruptcy merely would have been delayed a day or two. And it would have been well nigh impossible to put together a three party takeover deal between the close of business in New York and market opening in Asia on a weekday.But the most appalling aspect of Sorkin&#8217;s account: he acts as if Bear had the right to be informed of the Fed&#8217;s plans. Sorkin seems to have forgotten the golden rule: he who has the gold makes the rules. The Fed had every right to be calling the shots. They were taking the biggest risk in this transaction. The notion that a firm about to fail is entitled to be treated as a being on an equal footing with its rescuers is absurd. And the fact that Sorkin (and presumably others on Wall Street) sympathize with this view says the industry badly needs to be leashed and collared.</p>
<p>This, frankly, is the reason why I am so incredibly appalled by <a href="http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2008/03/24/daily1.html">this</a>:</p>
<p>Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf said the financial crisis is presenting the bank with more acquisition opportunities. &#8220;I would not be averse to a Fed-assisted transaction,&#8221; Stumpf said in a recent interview with the San Francisco Business Times. &#8220;Fixer-uppers don&#8217;t bother us.&#8221; The San Francisco banker said any deal would have to meet the company&#8217;s traditional acquisition targets and benefit the bank&#8217;s acquired customers.To even mention, in public, that one &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t be averse to a Fed-assisted transaction&#8221; is to hint that the acquisition targets you are looking at are in as dire straits as Bear Stearns. What is Stumpf trying to do, start a run on an insured bank? Or, well, the other option is that Stumpf doesn&#8217;t believe that Bear was such a mess&#8211;that, precisely, it is &#8220;on an equal footing with its rescuers.&#8221;Either way you slice it, the very fact that he could say such a thing in public tells you how far down the wrong road we&#8217;ve gone. I vote for the leash and collar, pronto.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>A while <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/huawei-3-com-year-rat-began-to-swallow.html">back</a>, I commented Bain Capital and Huawaei&#8217;s proposed purchase of 3-Com&#8217;s with Huawei taking a 16% share. The Committee on Foreign Investment has nixed the deal, citing security concerns.</p>
<p>Bain functions as an advisor to 3-Com, as does Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s lineage is a bit obscure. Although it &#8220;seems&#8221; to be an independent entity, we do know, at the very least, that it has close ties to the Chinese military and to the Chinese government. Those ties were close enough, apparently, to cause the Committee on Foreign Investment to act.<br />Be all that as it may, nothing can deter progress. Who or what wants to go east will go east.</p>
<p>3-Com is beginning to <a href="http://www.crn.com/networking/206905454">restructure</a>,<br />
<blockquote>by moving research and development and engineering functions to China and India</p></blockquote>
<p>3-Com needs to be a more profitable enterprise, as I am sure its advisors so counseled.</p>
<p>On a more mundane front, the next dental crown or bridge you use may be from <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS131479+09-Jan-2008+PRN20080109">China</a>. Be sure to check it for lead.</p>
<p>On another yet front, I hear that large signs may soon be offshored. I find that depressingly amusing. Signs, of course, encourage you to buy stuff. The fact that they may soon be made elsewhere and put up here&#8230;.well, the irony is too much even for me.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know&#8230;all in the name of progress.</p>
<p>But I ask you, if a country makes less and less, trades less and less, does it not have to rely more and more on credit? And credit is something we have been very good at creating and packaging.</p>

<blockquote><p>Worcester, Massachusetts &#8211; On Lagrange Street in New England&#8217;s second-largest city, two brick apartment buildings stand side-by-side in varying stages of decay &#8211; boarded up, &#8220;No Trespassing&#8221; signs affixed, paint peeling.<br />Across the street, a condominium complex is on the brink. Three of its eight apartments are in foreclosure.</p>
<p>Like many cities in the United States where the home vacancy rate has scaled its highest since records began in 1956, the former textile mill city of Worcester in Massachusetts is turning to the courts to fight back.</p>
<p>Their target: banks who abandon properties and who leave behind a glut of empty, dilapidated houses that draw crime, cut tax revenue and depress nearby property values in a market already in a tailspin.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the trenches here. We&#8217;ve got to stabilize our community,&#8221; said Worcester city manager Michael O&#8217;Brien in a sidewalk interview outside the foreclosed condominiums on the quiet street in a Hispanic neighborhood.</p>
<p>The city of 175,898 people, a munitions depot during the U.S. Revolutionary War, offers a window into how U.S. cities are grappling with a wave of foreclosures that has pushed the U.S. homeowner vacancy rate to a record 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 &#8211; or about 1 million homes.</p>
<p>Like many U.S. mayors and city officials, O&#8217;Brien blames &#8220;predatory&#8221; lending practices prevalent in the U.S. property boom for the lion&#8217;s share of about 4,220 mortgages in his city that are either in, or at risk of, foreclosure.</p>
<p>In February, he began asking judges to assign property managers to buildings at the expense of the mortgage companies. The idea is to stop tenants from being abruptly tossed out of a foreclosed home and to provide enough basic maintenance to keep it from getting condemned.</p></blockquote>
<p>Buffalo<br />Cleveland<br />Detroit<br />Syracuse<br />Baltimore<br />Providence</p>
<p>The question of ownership and responsibility is indeed important, and the questions of costs are indeed not a Wall St. or Washington DC concern yet. There are creative responses given that the mandate to city governments is to survive&#8230;in many fashions. This list is a rustbelt special.</p>

There&#8217;s no question they know this material much better than I.</p>
<p>Bruce did send a quick e-mail, quoting from the report&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html">summary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The annual cost of Social Security benefits represented 4.3 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2007 and is projected to increase to 6.1 percent of GDP in 2035, and then decline to 5.8 percent of GDP by 2048 and remain at that level. The projected 75-year actuarial deficit in the combined Old-Age and Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Trust Fund is 1.70 percent of taxable payroll ($4.3 trillion in present value terms), down from 1.95 percent projected in last year&#8217;s report. This decrease is due primarily to changes in projection methods.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Wow, a decrease in payroll gap of a full .25 points and 75 year actuarial deficit down from $4.7 to $4.3 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Something about the Trustee&#8217;s Reports that come out every year make me think of a dog my Mom had when I was a kid.  When I was a kid and my family was living in Brazil, my Mom got a puppy.   A month later, the dog got sick and we were told the dog wasn&#8217;t going to last.  A couple months later, the dog was dying of something else.  Every few months, the dog came down with something, and she just wasn&#8217;t going to survive.  The process continued for many years.  The dog, who would travel more than most people and live in 3 different cities in 2 different continents, eventually died at age 14, which is pretty old for a big dog.</p>

                                <p>Are there two Lawrence Kudlows?  One keeps writing that we should promote a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/kudlow-calls-for-net-export-led.html">strong dollar</a> policy and then there is <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzQ4YTgwYTk2YmI2YTQ1NDQ5YmI5M2Y1ZDIwOWQyMzM=">this one</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have really learned to like Ben Bernanke. He’s the man. And his interest-rate cuts are vastly more effective than the so-called economic-stimulus rebate plan coming out of Congress and the White House.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not new for Kudlow.  He has bashed the FED for expansionary monetary policy and then argued in favor of easier monetary policy a few days later on several occasions.  I just wonder if the folks at the National Review are smart to enough to realize what a flip-flopper clown this fellow really is.</p>

<blockquote><p>The pity party thrown last week by the WSJ for Bear&#8217;s senior, er, management appears to have omitted some data:</p>
<p>Insiders at Bear sold a total of 715,000 shares last year worth more than $75 million, up from 2006 but down considerably from 2004, when sales of more than 1.5 million shares worth $147.9 million took place, the data show.<br />Since 2000, <strong>Cayne</strong> has sold 2.37 million shares worth about $182.7 million, while <strong>Schwartz</strong> has sold more than one million shares for roughly $67.2 million.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf said the financial crisis is presenting the bank with more acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not be averse to a Fed-assisted transaction,&#8221; Stumpf said in a recent interview with the San Francisco Business Times. &#8220;Fixer-uppers don&#8217;t bother us.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve already <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/ben-bernanke-nigerian-who-is-actually.html">made the same offer</a> to the Fed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Memo to Ben Bernanke: when the next stone is ready to hit the water (Lehman?), give me the money and I&#8217;ll buy it. Thanks dude.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly who would be averse to getting the same deal as JP Morgan &#8211; a guarantee they won&#8217;t lose money if they buy up a dead-beat?  And why should this opportunity only go to the big guys?  Give me a guarantee I won&#8217;t lose money buying any of these deadbeat banks and you can bet I raise the funds quickly.  So why is this a game that only the big guys are allowed to play?  </p>
<p>This sounds like I&#8217;m kidding, but I&#8217;m not.  See, the folks who are pushing for these bailouts keep telling us that the economy might implode without them.  OK.  If that were true (and I don&#8217;t believe it for a minute), and its important to keep the deadbeat banks around, does it really matter if the sweetheart deal goes to me instead of JP Morgan or Wells Fargo?  Its one thing to push for bailouts to &#8220;save the economy&#8221; no matter how shaky that argument might be. Its another to insist that the folks who get the payoffs from the Fed and the government have to be&#8230; the same folks who have always gotten the payoffs.</p>

                                <p>Noni Mausa sends a link to <a href="http://polmeth.wustl.edu/retrieve.php?id=740">this paper</a> (warning:  PDF!!!) by Andy Eggers and Jens Hainmueller.  Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the role of money in policymaking is a central question in political economy research, surprisingly little attention has been given to the rents politicians actually derive from politics. We use both matching and a regression discontinuity design to analyze an original dataset on the estates of recently deceased British politicians. We find that serving in Parliament roughly doubled the wealth at death of Conservative MPs but had no discernible effect on the wealth of Labour MPs. We argue that Conservative MPs profited from office in a lax regulatory environment by using their political positions to obtain outside work as directors, consultants, and lobbyists, both while in office and after retirement. Our results are consistent with anecdotal evidence on MPs&#8217; outside Financial dealings but suggest that the magnitude of Conservatives&#8217; financial gains from office was larger than has been appreciated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noni also asks whether this can be applied to American politicians.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the data to apply it to American politicians, and I&#8217;ll confess I only had the time to skim through the paper, but my thoughts:</p>
<p>1.  The results of the paper seem plausible to me<br />2.  I think you would see a similar difference if you looked at congresscritters<br />3.  I think part of the reason for the difference is that conservatives, politicians and otherwise, seem to confuse what is good for them with <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">what is good for the country</a> more than liberals.  I imagine some of them behave that way for more, um, direct reasons.<br />4.  My guess is that this effect isn&#8217;t simply one where the more conservative you are, the better you do.  While I do feel that extreme liberals probably do worse than centrist liberals, and centrist liberals do worse than centrist conservatives, I imagine the far right doesn&#8217;t do as well as centrist conservatives.  </p>
<p>Anyway, your thoughts about the study, what it may mean here in the US, and how to go about testing it?</p>
