                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Rumors are rife that the farmer suicide pandemic hitting India is directly related to Monsanto, Cargill, and Syngenta&#8211;multinational agri-business (over 17,000 suicides in 2003 alone&#8230;and the rate is apparently increasing.) What is happening <a href="http://www.countercurrents.org/glo-shiva050404.htm">here?</a><br />
<blockquote>In 1998, the World Bank&#8217;s structural adjustment policies forced India to open up its seed sector to global corporations like Cargill, Monsanto, and Syngenta. The global corporations changed the input economy overnight. Farm saved seeds were replaced by corporate seeds which needed fertilizers and pesticides and could not be saved.<br />As seed saving is prevented by patents as well as by the engineering of seeds with non-renewable traits, seed has to be bought for every planting season by poor peasants. A free resource available on farms became a commodity which farmers were forced to buy every year. This increases poverty and leads to indebtedness. </p></blockquote>
<p>Which leads to suicide. Once hooked, forever caught. One irony is that some genetically modified seeds require more water than the homegrown varieties. In drought prone areas of India, such seeds became a disaster.</p>
<p>Take BT cotton (a GM product), for example: Cotton resistant to boltworm. It did work. Unfortunately, the new plants were then susceptible to attacks from other insects&#8230;so much so that <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July06/Bt.cotton.China.ssl.html">farmers</a><br />
<blockquote>are now having to spray their crops up to 20 times a growing season to control them, according to the study of 481 Chinese farmers in five major cotton-producing provinces.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are reports of rashes and itching from BT cotton, to say nothing of the effect of all that pesticide on the local populace.</p>
<p>GE agri-products are now banned in the EU, but they still are finding their way into places like Pakistan&#8230;the road show has moved on. At the center of the problem lies the misleading studies of the efficacy of the seeds. A PR blitz, coupled with connections in high places, results in a successful shell game&#8230;until the locals either get wise or commit suicide after having been driven into poverty.</p>
<p>Of special concern are the terminator seeds, i.e., seeds that produce sterile plants, requiring the farmer to return to the multinational for more seeds. Terminator seeds should be outlawed. Not only do we threaten healthy biodiversity but also we simply condone an ever-greater transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich and powerful.</p>
<p>While I am certainly a devotee of science, I am leery of commercialized agri-science, where the seller does and then presents the studies. It took Mother Nature a long time to make food palatable for us. Tampering with Nature&#8217;s recipe should not be done lightly. And certainly the WTO should be cautious about being caterers to our new and questionable diet.</p>

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency has lowered its estimate of the the statistical value of a human life from about $8.04 million to $7.22 million, about an 11% drop.

                                <p>I don&#8217;t claim to have studied Medicare in depth. They send me the Reports in the same envelope with the Social Security Reports and I browse through them, but that is pretty much it. So this post is more of a call for people more informed on aspects of Medicare to chip in. But I want to throw out some basics. For those who want to follow along the 2008 Report can be found <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/economic-policy/reports/medicare-report-2008.pdf">here</a>:</p>
<p>First while there is no such thing as MedicareMedicaidSocial Security and while I firmly believe that the deliberate lumping of them together as &#8216;entitlements&#8217; is mostly a weasel-word effort that allows attacks on SS via the backdoor, there is a certain structural overlap. All six Social Security Trustees serve on the seven member Medicare Trustees board where they are joined by the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &#038; Medicaid Services. Which means when we score the outlook for Social Security we are also in part scoring the outlook for Medicare crisis because the Medicare Trustees not surprisingly adopt the Intermediate Cost assumptions of the Social Security Trustees, after all they are not schizoids. This has some implications which I will get to after laying down a couple more basics.</p>
<p>First Medicare is not a single program with a single funding source, instead it is made up of Medicare Parts A, B, C &#038; D.</p>
<p>Medicare Part A is Hospital Insurance and is paid for through payroll tax deductions, 3.01% in 2006. This tax differs from that of Social Security in one respect: it is not capped. But for the most part the better Social Security performs on the revenue side, the better Part A and its HI Trust Fund do, in short they track and overall we have seen the same progress in pushing out dates of Trust Fund Depletion. Somebody can fact check me on this but I believe that when Clinton entered office HI Trust Fund depletion was scheduled for 1999 or about seven years of cushion. By the 2007 Report that date had been pushed back to 2019, which was an increase of a full year over 2006. Why the improvement? Well the Trustees tell us it was &#8220;due to slightly higher projected payroll tax income and slightly lower benefits than previously estimated&#8221;. In other words their revenue model was too pessimistic, they used Intermediate Cost. Now the 2008 Report reports that Trust Fund Depletion is still scheduled for 2019 but several months earlier in the year than the 2007. Why the slight deterioration? &#8220;due to slightly lower projected payroll tax income and slightly higher projected benefits than previously estimated. For the 75-year projection period, the actuarial deficit is virtually the same as in last year’s report, at 3.54 rather than 3.55 percent of taxable payroll. &#8221; I don&#8217;t know the reason for the slightly higher projected benefits, but the reduced payroll tax income can be explained in three words: &#8216;crappy fourth quarter&#8217;. Social Security OAS was on track to beat revenue expectations right through September, then the floor fell out.</p>
<p>But the larger picture remains the same, if the economy outperforms Intermediate Cost then the Medicare HI Trust Fund gains more revenue and the outlook should improve. This is complicated somewhat by medical inflation, if most of your overall GDP growth is coming from increased medical costs then the net might end up negative. Which is where you readers come in, any thoughts on how this offsets?</p>
<p>Medicare Parts B, C, &#038; D are mostly funded via the General Fund suplemented by premiums from beneficiaries. Part B is Doctors, Part C is Medicare Advantage (private insurance alternative) and Part D is Drugs. As General Fund programs they are not particularly walled off in the way Part A is with results we saw playing out last week.</p>
<p>Opponents of Medicare don&#8217;t have much of an opening on the Part A side, not when its financial health has been improving even if the face of soaring medical costs overall. And you only have to pick up the paper or know someone who has been hosptialized for even invasive surgery. Chances are pretty good you get maybe one night and boom out you go.</p>
<p>Which leaves them left to attack B, C, &#038; D. Which leaves them in a quandary. Part D is a Bush initiative and hugely favorable to Big Pharma, while Part C is hugely favorable to private insurance companies. Which leaves Part B-Doctors. So how did they propose to do this? Follow me briefly below the fold.</p>
<p>It was rather diabolical really. Prior to the introduction of Part C &#038; D costs were roughly split between A &#038; B with A being the bigger brother of the two. And given their different roles and different funding schemes there was little reason to cross compare them. If a doctor getting paid under B was able to give in office care in a way that avoided hospitalization then A saves some money while the spending ratio shifts towards B. On the other hand if B is not taking Medicare patients you may have to wait for that stroke to kick in before being able to get hopitalized under A, at much higher cost thus sending the A/B ratio the other way. While I&#8217;ll defer to others on the cost specifics (S-T-R?) it would seem to the outside observer that keeping people out of the hospital (A) via preventive care (B) and simple generic medications for heart and chloesterol (D) would have to be cheaper than the alternative. On balance it would seem that long term the goal should be to get the overall ratio of medical resources to A down and to B &#038; D up. Which is where the 45% rule steps in.</p>
<p>The 45% rule came in with the same bill that introduced Parts C &#038; D, the Medicare Modernization Act. You can see MMA&#8217;s basic provisions at Wiki. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Prescription_Drug,_Improvement,_and_Modernization_Act<br />But to see discussion of the 45% rule try this: http://www.ncpssm.org/news/archive/vp_45_percent_trigger/</p>
<p>What the 45% rule does is establish a trigger. As soon as the General Fund share of Medicare hits 45% then cuts to Part B are created immediately. Note not to Parts C &#038; D, both equally funded by the General Fund, that would take away from the Insurance Industry and Big Pharma. Nope lets pass the entire cost onto doctors.</p>
<p>Well that is just nutty. If this trigger were based on some overall share of GDP then it would make some sense but instead it is based on a ratio between the various components that is not directly related to overall deterioration or improvement in the health care system. If Doctor B takes on ten new Medicare patients and is able to keep three of them out of the hospital by prescribing a $1 a day generic supplied by Pharmacist D, who cares if Hospital Administrator A doesn&#8217;t get to bill medicare. We got three less people with heart attacks or strokes. Yet under the 45% rule the better preventive care gets the closer you get to the trigger. Counterproductive doesn&#8217;t begin to describe it. Unless of course your real goal is to force doctors to turn away Medicare patients to start with and so prove that this program is just another example of &#8216;Big Government is the Problem&#8217;.</p>
<p>Why do I say diabolical? Because they doubled down. First they set up a totally irrelevant ratio between A &#038; B and then saddled the B side with additional obligations in the way of C &#038; D and so practically guaranteeing the trigger. The system was set up to fail an artificial test and so pave the way for privatization under insurance company friendly Part C. Maybe others can see this in some other light, which I guess is what comments are for.</p>
<p>Health care mavens? (And don&#8217;t hesitate to comment or pose a question about Social Security, I just didn&#8217;t have a dedicated SS post prepared.)</p>

                                <p>Budget Peace in our Times</p>
<p>by Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>How can it be that the US military is strained to the breaking point occupying (sorry assisting) two medium sized countries when we spend about half of total world military spending? I&#8217;m not sure this post is in the Angry Bear <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nation/5896116.html">comfort zone</a>, but one reason is that US elected officials have allowed the services to form a budget request cartel such that increased spending on the Army and Marines must be balanced by increased spending on the Air Force and Navy which is needed so they can protect us from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I am moved to type this by Ezra Klein&#8217;s post <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=07&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=clarke_on_obama#comments">&#8220;Clarke on Obama&#8221;</a> and, in particular, by a comment.</p>
<blockquote><p>IIRC, Obama is talking about expanding the number of &#8220;men under arms&#8221; and shifting a bit from expensive metal stuff to a more &#8220;labor intensive&#8221; military.</p>
<p>While McCain wants more soldiers AND more expensive metal stuff.</p>
<p>Posted by: joe from Lowell  July 18, 2008 3:41 PM</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Joe from Lowell&#8217;s version of Obama that <a href="http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0207/020107cdam3.htm">the problem is the rigid rule</a> that :<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Until now, the Pentagon has largely divvied up the services&#8217; shares of the defense budget the same way every year: the Army receives 24 percent, the Air Force 29 percent, and the Navy and Marines a combined 31 percent. It is a delicate balance that has kept the services from moving aggressively to raid each other&#8217;s accounts to pay for their additional needs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>leading to absurdities like <a href="http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=40054">emergency borrowing by the Army</a></p>
<blockquote><p>That&#8217;s no way to run a republic, it also no way to run an empire. While the candidates debate empire vs republic maybe they can also debate Army vs Navy (not the football game). No prize for guessing which side McCain will be on. This is an issue where he probably actually cares and where his likely position is clearly absurd.</p></blockquote>
<p>The one key step is to ask former secretary of the Navy Senator Jim Webb if he is on board for the anti Navy plan before attempting take off (from the Air Force too).</p>
<p>update:  title changed because first it appeared twice (sorry I&#8217;m not aware of all Angrybear internet traditions) and second because I just realized that the headline of the www.govexec.com article is &#8220;Rising Army, Marine Corps costs may trigger budget war.&#8221;   Yep there is concern that the US military might be involved in a war, not a little dustup like that <strike>occupation</strike> fraternal assistance in Iraq but a really unacceptable intolerable inter service budget war.  &#8220;Peace in our time&#8221; was Neville Chamberlain&#8217;s slogan.  I say stop appeasing the Navy and Air Force (check polls in Colorado on second point).</p>

                                <p>by stormy</p>
<p>The WTO <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hR5hllJ5Y188INsFxKwiWkJzdzpQD920FJJ00">ruled against China</a> because it taxed imported car parts at the same rate it taxed imported foreign cars, something it had promised not to do on entry into the WTO. The result of that taxation was to encourage auto part manufacturing to relocate in China. (Remember Delphi?)</p>
<p>In ruling against China, the WTO declared that China was giving preferential treatment to auto parts made in China (no equivalent tax on them.)<br />
<blockquote>China&#8217;s car-making market has grown rapidly and it is now third in auto sales after the U.S. and Japan. However, manufacturers have to source 40 percent of parts by value in China to avoid the tax, and foreign makers of parts have only recently started to keep pace with the overall growth in the Chinese market.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>China&#8217;s full-year vehicle sales in 2007 rose 22 percent to 8.8 million units, according to the government-sanctioned China Association of Automobile Manufacturers</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, China offered other incentives for sourcing inside China: Preferential tax treatment to foreign manufacturers. They were (until recently) taxed at half the rate as indigenous firms. (And sometimes, at zero rate.)</p>
<p>Quite clearly, China has kept its focus on becoming the world&#8217;s exporter, using taxation gimmicks and cheap labor as the lure. This latest WTO ruling is certainly welcome. But, because China gave preferential tax treatment to foreign firms inside China, no violation occurred on that front. The WTO permits that kind of inequality.</p>
<p>Indeed, foreign firms relocating to China are still given a 5-year tax holiday, especially for foreign firms higher in the value chain, as well as preferential tax rates in &#8220;some regions.&#8221; (See <a href="http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/article/0,1002,cid%253D181128,00.html">here</a>. Foreign taxation policies, while of little concern to many, still plays an important part in our trade deficit.</p>
<p>Lest anyone suggest that we should lower U.S. corporate taxation, consider the consequences if we followed China&#8217;s example: Tax holidays and/or lower taxation on foreign firms in the U.S. &#8211;and conversely, higher taxation on our own firms. Of course, to complement this policy, we should also relax minimum wage and labor standards. (Well, I guess we do that with our immigration non-policy. Chuckle.)</p>
<p>The ideological center of this problem is the WTO principle that foreign firms shall not be disadvantaged. In short, a country is allowed to place its own firms and its own populace at a significant disadvantage. How we deal with the full scope of China&#8217;s taxation policy is important. The WTO cannot, ideologically, deal with it. How do we deal with a country that uses its taxation policy to lure our firms by disadvantaging its own?</p>
<p>Is our response tax rebates, better education, rebuilding our infrastructure. Are these answers? Or do we pin our hopes on China&#8217;s notoriously weak regulatory process, all those lead-laced Mattel toys, for example?</p>
<p>Apart from the current violation, we do not seem to have the framework with which to address the problem. Should the WTO expand its &#8220;fairness&#8221; principle to include indigenous firms so that they cannot be placed at an unfair advantage to foreign firms in terms of taxation? Just a thought.</p>

                                <p>I’m just shaking my head as to how long it has taken Team McCain to throw <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0708/Gramm_stands_down.html">Phil Gramm</a> under the bus:</p>
<blockquote><p>Former Sen. Phil Gramm is stepping down from his post as national co-chair for John McCain a week after creating headaches for the campaign by calling Americans &#8220;whiners&#8221; and saying the country was only experiencing a &#8220;mental recession.&#8221; In a statement issued tonight, after the national news broadcasts, Gramm, a former Texas senator-turned-investment banker, said he didn&#8217;t want to be a distraction. &#8220;It is clear to me that Democrats want to attack me rather than debate Senator McCain on important economic issues facing the country,&#8221; said Gramm, who has been one of McCain&#8217;s economic advisers. &#8220;That kind of distraction hurts not only Senator McCain&#8217;s ability to present concrete programs to deal with the country&#8217;s problems, it hurts the country.&#8221; Gramm&#8217;s decison comes after word that, in his weekend column, Robert Novak was to report that the Gramm and McCain had talked subsequent to the ill-time remarks and that he&#8217;d stay on as a surrogate and adviser.</p></blockquote>
<p>You see – we Democrats forced Gramm to use say the nation is a bunch of whiners.  This whole thing reminds me of something <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_K._Mooney_Will_You_Please_Go_Now!">Dr. Seuss</a> wrote.  After all – Gramm may still be advising John McCain on economic issues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gramm&#8217;s move tonight appears to be a move to clarify his status. But when asked whether this meant he&#8217;d no longer advise or represent McCain, Bounds only said that it was Gramm&#8217;s decision to step down from his co-chair post.</p></blockquote>
<p>And even if Gramm is no longer acting as an economic advisor – John McCain still thinks increasing defense spending and cutting taxes reduces the government deficit.  After all – this fiscal policy worked so well during the 1980’s and over the past 7 plus years!</p>
