<blockquote>Are these guys in a contest to see who can write the most moronic book? Or what?</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin was specifically referring to <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385510127">The Enemy at Home</a> by Dinesh D&#8217;Souza:<br />
<blockquote>In THE ENEMY AT HOME, bestselling author Dinesh D’Souza makes the startling claim that the 9/11 attacks and other terrorist acts around the world can be directly traced to the ideas and attitudes perpetrated by America’s cultural left. D’Souza shows that liberals &#8211; people like Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy, Barney Frank, Bill Moyers, and Michael Moore &#8211; are responsible for fostering a culture that angers and repulses not just Muslim countries but also traditional and religious societies around the world. Their outspoken opposition to American foreign policy &#8211; including the way the Bush administration is conducting the war on terror &#8211; contributes to the growing hostility, encouraging people both at home and abroad to blame America for the problems of the world. He argues that it is not our exercise of freedom that enrages our enemies, but our abuse of that freedom &#8211; from the sexual liberty of women to the support of gay marriage, birth control, and no-fault divorce, to the aggressive exportation of our vulgar, licentious popular culture.</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven’t purchased Ramesh Ponnuru’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Party-Death-Democrats-Courts-Disregard/dp/1596980044">The Party of Death</a> either and will skip Jonah Goldberg’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-Totalitarian-Temptation-Mussolini/dp/0385511841/sr=1-1/qid=1157748743/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-1916674-6622223?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books">Liberal Fascism</a> when it comes out.  It’s bad enough reading their moronic opeds, but an entire book?  That one would have to pay for?</p>
<p>Something tells me, however, that their books do well in those caves on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan.  After all, 9/11 was our fault not theirs according to Dinesh D&#8217;Souza.  Unbelievable!</p>

                                <p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/09/kept-promise.html">Greg Mankiw</a> argues that Bush kept the following promise:<br />
<blockquote>On principle no one in America should have to pay more than a third of their income to the federal government.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/09/department_of_h_2.html">Brad DeLong</a> objects:<br />
<blockquote>In no meaningful sense has George W. Bush reduced the tax burden. In no meaningful sense has he kept any promise. George W. Bush has kept his promise to cut taxes in the same way that a spouse who decides to &#8220;save money&#8221; by making only the minimum required payment on the VISA bill has kept a promise to reduce household spending. As Milton Friedman puts it, to spend is to tax. Bush&#8217;s spending increases &#8211; defense, Iraq, the Republican porkfest, the Medicare drug benefit &#8211; are still there, just as things you have charged to your VISA don&#8217;t go away if you make only the minimum monthly payment. What George W. Bush has done has been to shift taxes from the present to the future &#8211; and also made future taxes uncertain, random, and thus extra-costly from a standard public finance view.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is true that the average long-term tax bite for Americans has been increased under George W. Bush, but that does not necessarily undermine the proposition that the specific promise might be kept.  After all, this Administration is hell bent on shifting the tax burden away from the rich and towards the poor.  While I have consistently agreed with Brad on the simple premise that these mounting Federal debts are increases in deferred taxes, we have no clue who will pay those future tax bills in the future. While George W. Bush tries to tell us that no one will have to pay more, simple arithmetic says such claims are false.  </p>
<p>But what if the future tax increases are levied on middle class Americans and the working poor?  Then it is entirely possibly that the promise that no one “pay more than a third of their income to the federal government” might indeed be kept.  Alas, few will pay much less than a third either.  Of course, this wasn’t Greg’s point.  Or was it?</p>

                                <p>Suppose that some NRO nitwit wrote a story about how a worker making $22 an hour in 2005 was better off than a worker making $20 an hour in 2000.  After all, his nominal wage had risen by 10%.  But consumer prices have risen by 13%, so his real wage would have declined.  Now if it turned out that his wage rate had increased by 17.5% to $23.50, then his real wage would have increased by 4%.  </p>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/09/fire_david_broo.html">Brad DeLong</a> reads <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002490.html">Jared Bernstein</a> on the latest from <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/2006/09/07/opinion/07brooks.html&#038;OQ=_rQ3D1&#038;OP=3654e6cbQ2FQ2AbH0Q2AZGemmZQ2AwJJQ5BQ2AJFQ2AJQ60Q2Amo.V.mVQ2AJQ600emmgGEhZ-Q5D">David Brooks</a> and demands that the New York Times fire Mr. Brooks.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/09/hoisted_from_co.html">John Schmitt</a> does the research that Mr. Brooks failed to do: <br />
<blockquote>I was also curious about Brooks&#8217;s claim that: &#8220;The typical male worker with some college but no degree has seen his income rise from $34,000 in 2000 to about $40,000 today.&#8221; These numbers probably give most readers the impression that the real annual earnings of the typical man with some college but no degree rose about 18 percent between 2000 and 2005. A quick check at the Census web page shows median annual earnings for men 25 and over with &#8220;some college no degree&#8221; to be $35,463 in 2000, rising to $39,150 in 2005. But, both figures are in nominal terms. Adjusting the Census numbers above for inflation suggests that the earnings of the typical man with some college but no degree actually fell about 3 percent over the same period.</p></blockquote>
<p>John wants to know where Mr. Brooks got his information.  My bet?  Mr. Brooks hasn’t a clue.   So yes, fire Mr. Brooks and let’s have Paul Krugman write three op-eds a week &#8211; assuming Dr. Krugman has the time and doesn’t mind all the false accusations that he makes stuff up.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>More evidence that the <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTdlNGE5OTE0YTMyZjBiNzZjN2UzNWEzNGUxNmQxMTI=">National Review</a> is not even fit to line the bird cage &#8211; John Miller endorses <a href="http://newsbusters.org/node/7420">this review</a> of a very dishonest partisan docudrama:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s sad, but predictable, that some on the far left have dismissed this film as a &#8220;right-wing&#8221; snow job. The first line of attack on the film came from loyal Clinton Democrats who are simply incapable of accepting any blame, or even a dollop of criticism over the mistakes leading up to 9/11 &#8230; These folks either haven&#8217;t watched the film, in which case they ought to remain silent, or have seen it, in which case they are being disingenuous.</p></blockquote>
<p>“These folks” have asked to have the same preview rights as Rush Limbaugh but ABC has refused that request.  To his credit, however, Bozell writes:<br />
<blockquote>Serious scholars of current events, not to mention some of those named in the film, may take issue with parts of this presentation. The movie is based on the report of the 9/11 Commission, which itself is not infallible in its conclusions on what went wrong and what needs to fixed. Moreover, up front the moviemakers note it has composite characters and manipulates the time of events for a better movie experience. As a &#8220;docudrama&#8221; it has taken certain poetic license with history.</p></blockquote>
<p>What a polite way of saying the film lies.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh090706.shtml">Bob Somerby</a> sees a silver lining:<br />
<blockquote>For some Americans, this episode will break the back of that bewitching old claim, “liberal bias.” We’d guess that some Americans will finally say: “Wait a minute. Whatever we’re seeing played out in this incident, it isn’t some sort of lib bias.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This controversy reminds me of how <a href="http://markschmitt.typepad.com/decembrist/2004/10/sinclair_broadc.html">Sinclair Broadcasting</a> created a buzz with its Swift Boat advertorial.  We already have Faux News, which is blatantly a Republican propaganda machine – now this.  Forget whether someone is a liberal or conservative.  What bothers many of us is how certain pseudo news types just flat out lie to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/09/07/bozell-edit">ThinkProgress</a> (who has been leading the charge against the inaccuracies of this film) applauds Brent Bozell for something he said to Joe Scarborough: <br />
<blockquote>BOZELL: Let me say this, I think that if you have a scene, or two scenes, or three scenes, important scenes, that do not have any bearing on reality and you can edit them, I think they should edit them. <br />[Snip]<br />SCARBOROUGH: And Brent, that seems very fair, right, if they are factually inaccurate here, you’d be calling for them to take it off the air too, right?<br />BOZELL: Yeah, yeah. I think where, if they are factually inaccurate and they can correct it, they ought to.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good for him!  As far as the “if they are factually inaccurate”, the folks at ThinkProgress have clearly demonstrated that there are.</p>
<p><strong>Update III</strong>: Who is <a href="http://hughhewitt.townhall.com/g/9367b3cd-be2a-40a3-b927-1854a0115108">Hugh Hewitt</a> kidding with this:<br />
<blockquote>The story here is the backlash that the Disney/ABC execs experienced was completely unexpected and is what caused them to question themselves and make these changes at all. Had this been the Bush Admin pressuring, they wouldn&#8217;t have even taken the call. The execs and studio bosses are dyed in the wool liberals and huge supporters of Clinton and the Democratic Party in general. They had no idea any of this could happen. As I understand this, the lawyers and production team spent literally months corroborating every story point down to the sentence. The fact that they were the attacked and vilified by their &#8220;own team&#8221; took them completely by surprise; this is the first time they&#8217;ve been labeled right-wing, conservative conspiracists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to AB reader Mike for the hat tip.  Let’s say CBS was about to run a story documenting the real lapses of judgment of Condi Rice and George W. Bush prior to 9/11.  The pressure from the rightwing would be intense.  And if the executives of CBS got a call from the White House, I bet they would be very intimated by it.  As far as “corroborating every story point down to the sentence”, Hewitt by now has to know this is not true given that there are at least three major scenes where this film just flat out lies.</p>
<p><strong>Final Word</strong>: Leave it to <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MTYzYTliY2RmZjcyNjNhNjliMTA0OGVhOGVjYTVmMTY=">Michael Ledeen</a> to come up with the dumbest comment possible on this issue:<br />
<blockquote>Have I missed something here, but haven&#8217;t the Senate Democrats launched a totally McCarthyite assault on ABC?  And is there no Republican leader to call them by their proper name?  Free press means freedom to screw up, among other things&#8230;this is just the usual intimidation by a party that no longer has a grip on reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Senator McCarthy terrorized Hollywood as well as average Americans by spreading false accusations about their character.  His motive was raw partisan politics.   So what are we Democrats doing?  Simply asking ABC to not lie to the American people about the events leading up to 9/11.  The motivations behind the smear of the former Clinton Administration is raw partisan politics.   We should call things by their proper names – but before we do so, let’s try to get the story right.  Could you please do so, Michael?  Or maybe Michael has completely lost sight of what is real.</p>

                                <p>On August 29, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_08/009415.php">Kevin Drum</a> noted:<br />
<blockquote>The good news is that women are now making 77% as much as men, slightly higher than last year. The bad news is that this is only because the median income of women fell at a slightly lower rate (-1.3%) than the median income of men (-1.8%). Yipee.</p></blockquote>
<p>On August 31, the Department of Labor released <a href="http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/opa/opa20061537.htm">America’s Workforce: Strong, Competitive and Growing</a>, which included all sorts of great news for working women including:<br />
<blockquote>What has been called the &#8220;pay gap&#8221; is shrinking and is now the smallest it has ever been since the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) began tracking this data.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max Sawicky calls this <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002489.html">Chao Time</a> as he points us to an analysis from <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/webfeatures_snapshots_20060906">Sylvia Allegretto</a>:<br />
<blockquote>After an increase in the gap from 2002 to 2003, the gap shrunk over the last two years. However, as the Figure shows, these declines were solely due to the fact that earnings have fallen for both men and women, but have fallen more so for men &#8211; not a desirable scenario.  Amazingly, the Department of Labor brags that the gender gap in pay is now the smallest ever, while completely ignoring how we got there. Following current earnings trends, the Figure projects what more “good news” of this sort would bring in the decades ahead. It turns out the gender gap would completely close in 2024, when earnings for full-time, full-year workers would be just under $25,000 &#8211; 40% below today’s level for men and 22% for women.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I suspect Kevin would not wish to work for the Bush Administration and he says he is not an economist.  But his blog is a more reliable source for information on our economy than the crew who works for this White House.</p>

                                <p>The first story during Katie Couric’s first show as the new anchorperson for the CBS Evening News was delivered by <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/05/eveningnews/main1969626.shtml">Lara Logan</a> with Katie’s opening being:<br />
<blockquote>Nearly five years after U.S. forces defeated the Taliban and scattered the al Qaeda terrorists they were protecting, the Taliban and their terror tactics are back.  This year in Afghanistan, roadside bombings are up 30 percent. Suicide bombings are up 100 percent and more than 100 U.S. and NATO troops have been killed. In response, the allies have launched a counter-offensive against the Taliban, killing as many as 60 on Tuesday alone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, the rest of the news outlets are playing catch-up to this important story as to how Bush’s incompetence is allowing the Taliban to gain influence in Afghanistan, which of course, allows Osama bin Laden more comfort that we will not capture him anytime soon.  As I thought that this was a great beginning for Ms. Couric’s new position, I also wondered how the rightwing would respond.  </p>
<p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZmY1NDUxNGJhODU5NmRhMTUzNzA3MjFmMWZhNzk1NjY=">Tim Graham</a> endorsed the suggestion that Katie Couric end her shows with “that’s the way it is at the DNC”, which must mean Tim was disappointed that CBS had not become Faux News II.  <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzkyN2JiNTc1Y2ExOThiNzA2NWE2ZDQwMGMyOWM0YmE=">KLo</a> had a similar reaction but she also had to put forth a fashion critique:<br />
<blockquote>Oh the completely catty commentary that will be forthcoming (nevermind the white after Labor Day)&#8230;.alright, maybe it&#8217;s time for me to turn Brit back on.</p></blockquote>
<p>KLo <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MTNlYTVjNzg3OTNmYmYxOTE5ZjkxMzlhYTlmZWRhYjQ=">repeats herself</a> but then criticizes Couric for a little <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MWU4NjQ3ZWYzZmYzMDZmNzIwMzU3NDkzZjVjZTU3ZTk=">humor</a>.</p>
<p>You see – the Corner Kids were hoping for Katie Couric to wear the right outfit as she told her audience that Bush’s incompetence was actually prevailing in the war on terror.  In other words, be more like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTeKZBD-ZIU&#038;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.atrios.blogspot.com%2F">Neil Cavuto</a>.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A few months ago, Peggy Noonan, Reagan’s old speechwriter, writing in the Wall Street Journal, asked:  <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110008093"> “When George W. Bush first came on the scene in 2000, did you understand him to be a liberal in terms of spending?”</a>  Other conservatives, such as Bruce Bartlett, have also criticized GW for spending too much.  (For whatever reason, the Republican Congress doesn’t seem to merit anywhere near as much, if any, criticism, though presumably they could hold him back if they chose to do so.)  </p>
<p>Now, I tend to agree that GW spends way too much.  But, there are two sides to running a deficit, and focusing on outflows while ignoring inflows is asinine.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z3.xls"> According to the OMB, </a>  in 2005, the deficit was 2.6 percent of GDP, federal spending was 20.1 percent of GDP, and tax revenues were 17.5 percent of GDP.  Presumably, GW’s tax cuts had already started having an effect, as there has been some <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MDlmYmIwMDU4ZTg1YmJkNWY3MWUzZTQ3YmEzYTBjZjY="> crowing about the size of tax revenues by prominent conservatives. </a>  </p>
<p>In 2000, the last year before GW took office, the surplus was 2.4 percent of GDP, federal spending was 18.4 percent of GDP, and tax revenues were 20.9 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>As a simple counterfactual, say that tax revenues had stayed at 20.9 percent of GDP as it was in 2000, but spending had increased as it did from 18.4 percent of GDP to 20.1 percent of GDP, as it has under GW.  This would lead to a reduction in the surplus of 1.7 percent, resulting in a surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2005.  </p>
<p>But say instead, that spending had stayed the same as it had been in 2000, but that tax collections had, as they actually did, fallen from 20.9 percent of GDP to 17.5 percent of GDP.  This would have resulted in a 0.8 percent deficit.  </p>
<p>All of which is to say &#8211; if GW had increased spending but not cut taxes, there would be no deficit.  If GW had kept spending constant but still cut taxes, we would still have a deficit.</p>
<p>Now, a conservative might argue that this is unfair – that the tax cuts will eventually lead to much higher tax revenues as a percentage of GDP.  But…  during the Reagan – GHW Bush era, tax revenues as a percentage of GDP peaked in 1981, and achieved their second highest point in 1982.  In other words, tax revenues as a percentage of GDP were highest before the Reagan tax cuts took effect.  Similarly, under Clinton, tax revenues as a percentage of GDP were at their lowest at the start of his term, before the tax increases.  </p>
<p>Therefore… it doesn’t make much sense for a fiscal conservative to criticize GW for spending too much but praise his tax cuts.</p>

So is <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_09/009452.php">Kevin Drum</a> who does a nice job of summarizing what the Democratic plan to combating terrorism looks like.   Kevin proposes that:<br />
<blockquote>At this point, it strikes me that our problem is less about agreeing on policy than it is about agreeing on marketing. We have enough consensus on policy that we can move forward if we only have the courage of our convictions about this stuff. We need to talk about our approach out loud, we need to believe that people aren&#8217;t too scared or stupid to make sense of it, and we need to be clear that we think Republicans are taking a hysterical approach to national security that&#8217;s both partisan and foolish.</p></blockquote>
<p>Soledad O’Brien just interviewed Senator Durbin who was following Kevin’s advice.  In his appearance on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14568263">Meet the Press</a>, Bob Casey did as well.  But watch the doublespeak from Rick Santorum:<br />
<blockquote>SEN. SANTORUM: Look, the plans that my opponent has laid out in some of his speeches and I’ve laid out in mine are basically the same thing the administration is trying to do. &#8230; My, my opponent has, my opponent has, my opponent has no plan. The idea—all he’s suggested is his plan is Special&#8230;<br />MR. CASEY: I just gave a plan. Where’s yours?<br />SEN. SANTORUM: All you, all you suggested with your plan is more Special Forces.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Democrats have no plan followed by their plan isn’t that great preceded by the claim that the President has adopted the Democrat’s plan is laughable.  So why do the Republicans keep repeating such absurdities?  One clue is how moderators like Tim Russert let the Republicans get away with saying such nonsense.  Casey’s fireback “I just gave a plan. Where’s yours?” was perfect.  Let’s see more of this.</p>

                                <p>Does <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=M2NjYjkwNWM0YzRkMDA0Yjk2ZDI2NjhlNGU1NjU5ZjY=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> think the readers of National Review are stupid little children who deserve to be lied to:<br />
<blockquote>Long-term jobs growth has moved to an all-time high of 145 million in the household survey and 136 million in nonfarm payrolls. Both measures are rising at about 1.5 percent, the average for jobs growth dating back to 1995 &#8230; Tax cuts are a winner. They throw off benefits across the board: capital formation, profitable business, job gains, wage increases, and consumer spending power. You’d think the Dems would learn. But they never do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did you spot the deception here?  If not, let me cut through the deliberately vague writing style of Lawrence Kudlow.  Employment today is about 117% of what payroll employment was back in 1995.  But employment today is only 2.28% higher than it was as of December 2000.  So during the 5 years and 8 months of the Bush Administration, employment growth has average only 0.4% per year.  </p>
<p>When President Clinton signed into law the 1993 tax increase, the free lunch supply-side crowd (that’d be you Larry) said it would lead to lower growth rates for real GDP and employment.  They turned out to be wrong.  Now Kudlow is trying to tell his readers that the Bush tax cuts led to faster growth, which of course is clearly not true.  </p>
<p>Mixing in the high growth years of the late 1990’s with the slow growth years under President Bush is transparently dishonest.  Only a complete moron would fall for this obvious deception.  I pity the people who Lawrence Kudlow is trying to appeal to as he thinks they are incredibly stupid and deserve to be lied to.</p>
