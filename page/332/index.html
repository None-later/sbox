<p>Update:  Based on the comments it looks like no one watched the unedited tapes.  Others have been released in other states.  Rachel Maddow has parsed the California tapes.  Now if you beat her up as only talk show news, I have a few names to mention as well.</p>

                                <p>In case you haven’t noticed, I have become slightly less “optimistic”  about the prospects of a sustainable U.S. recovery. I used to think that  the household deleveraging story was more of a decade-long project, and the economy would cycle throughout. But recent deficit hysteria has  me worried; income growth might lapse.</p>
<p>What differentiates this recovery from every other cycle since 1929 is the lingering debt deflationary pressures. There is a very large overhang of U.S. household financial leverage that’s going down one of two ways: the easy way, through nominal income growth, or the hard way, by default. Unfortunately, the hard way is rearing its ugly head.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7qD_aAEA4I/AAAAAAAAC_s/gqt-sJG9Azo/s1600/leverage_chart.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7qD_aAEA4I/AAAAAAAAC_s/gqt-sJG9Azo/s400/leverage_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart above illustrates private-sector financial leverage (debt burden). Not a surprise; but, the real leverage problem is in the household sector, and to a much lesser degree, the non-financial business sector. Household debt burden is the ratio of the debt stock (generally mortgages outstanding plus consumer credit) to income flow (personal disposable income), while “de-leveraging” is reducing this debt burden.</p>
<p>Given that the burden has a numerator (debt stock) and a denominator (income), de-leveraging can occur through either variable. As such, I see three (general) de-leveraging scenarios (See an earlier <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/publications/us_consumers/">McKinsey  stud</a>y on the  consumer for a broader discussion):</p>
<p>1. If there is no income growth, then households must manually pay down debt at the cost of current consumption. The consumption decline drags the economy, and some default results.</p>
<p>2. If income growth is positive, then the degree to which households must pay down debt at the cost of current consumption will depend on the pace of income generation. This is the most macroeconomically-benign scenario.</p>
<p>3. If income growth is negative, i.e., deflation, then real debt burden rises. 30-yr mortgage payments, for example, are fixed in nominal terms and become more difficult to meet as income declines. In this case, widespread default is likely.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Of course, these are just three broad categories, but I believe that my point has been made. Clearly, choice 2. is optimal. However, evidence is pointing to a de-leveraging process that is more of the 1. and/or 3. type, especially as the federal stimulus effects run dry (although I have noted before that there is room for error in the <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/04/saving-rate-paradox.html">measurement of the income data</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7qD_P-vAmI/AAAAAAAAC_k/m9q1dm0zU68/s1600/income_chart.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7qD_P-vAmI/AAAAAAAAC_k/m9q1dm0zU68/s400/income_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart illustrates annual growth of disposable personal income minus annual growth of disposable personal income less government transfer receipts (DPI – DPIexT). The variable DPIexT proxies the personal income growth currently generated by the private sector only. Note: this is a calculated number, based on the BEA’s monthly personal income report (Excel data <a href="http://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/pi/2010/xls/pi0210.xls">here</a>). The spread has never been wider, 2.1% Y/Y DPI growth over DPIexT growth in February, spanning every recession since 1980.</p>
<p>The government is propping up income (as it should be). Spanning February 2009 to February 2010, DPI averaged 1.2% Y/Y growth per month, while DPIexT averaged -1.1% Y/Y per month.  Further, since the onset of the recession DPIexT fell an average 0.03% M/M (over the previous month), while DPI grew 0.18% M/M.</p>
<p>The economy has crossed the threshold <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/04/the-recession-is-over.html">and is expanding</a> – phew! However, without a burst of export income, it’s going to take a lot more than <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t17.htm">123,000 private payroll</a> jobs per month to free the economy of its fiscal crutch. (I debated whether or not to use the term “crutch” when applying it to fiscal policy because fiscal policy is not a crutch; but the metaphor works.)</p>
<p>Households WILL drop leverage further; it’s just a matter of how smoothly.</p>

                                <p>Nothing sinister. The Social Security and Medicare Annual Reports are released together each year because each interacts deeply with the other. The new Health Care Reform law significantly changes Medicare and so the Obama Administration decided to update its numbers to match the new reality. Which makes sense. But expect opponents to mount a hissy fit about Obama &#8216;hiding&#8217; something.</p>
<p>Because that is what they do.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Trust is the unspoken assumption in discussions of public policy.  So what is trust?</p>
<p>Trust can work two ways, as faith (a belief based on the insubstantial, the future and other truths placed offstage) and as considered belief based on onstage facts and past experience.  Like many troublesome English words, these ideas are opposites, but they share the same short and slippery designation.  Call them, for this essay, faith-trust and fact-trust.</p>
<p>So, when the mother has just heard her son is in jail for car theft and break and enter, she might say, “He couldn’t have done that, he’s a good boy, I trust him completely,” and the newspapers will dutifully repeat this but no-one thinks it is evidence of anything.  She may be right, she may be wrong, but her motherhood mandates that faith-trust will rule her public speech, if not her private doubts.</p>
<p>Conversely, when I set out to cross a footbridge, I calculate whether it will support me based on my previous experience with construction materials, my observation of this specific bridge, my knowledge of my own weight (don’t ask), and by watching other people and vehicles crossing the bridge before I do.  When I choose to cross, I may be right, or I may end up in the river (because trust is all about making guesses about consequences) but I have used a totally different form of “trust” in making that choice.</p>
<p>At this point I imagine you are asking what this has to do with economics and governance.  Answer:  it is the hidden element that explains a lot of inexplicable public choices.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The Bush administration was a secretive bunch who pushed over their 8 years to stow more and more information into hidden places, whether via “national security” classification or black-site  jails or offshore prisons or even lost-destroyed e-mail messages and videos.</p>
<p>Why did many people accept all this secrecy?  The hidden element, never spoken out loud, was:  “They do this to protect the USA – we trust them.”  Which trust-twin is this one?  Faith-trust.</p>
<p>Take another example: the conduct of the police, with or without Tasers.  In spite of some apparently blatant misuse of their power they are virtually never convicted of assault, murder, manslaughter etc.  Also, in court their testimony is given weight far beyond the average witness, when a little thought would wonder if this is justified.  It seems to me a large element of faith-trust is present here, too.</p>
<p>And then there is the problem of trust accorded to clergy.</p>
<p>Now secrecy, prevarication and promise breaking are, sadly, all necessary elements of governance, whether good governance or bad.  Use of force is an essential part of police practice, and religious practitioners work in a realm between worlds, where confidentiality and metaphorical, story-based thought are central, and divine logic can appear to run counter to the worldly.</p>
<p>Given these necessities, how are we to differentiate honest stewards and good guardians from plutocrats and well-spoken thugs?  And how, in self-defense, do we detect and detach ourselves from the injurious objects of our faith-trust? </p>
<p>And then there is the other side of faith-trust – faith-distrust.  How do we examine the things we have demonized – or which have been demonized for us – and reclaim them if we discover we have been wrong?</p>
<p>Fear and hatred are often called “only human,” but this is not true.  Our animal cousins share with us the capacity for fear and anger.  Very few things, in fact, are “only human.”  Fear is useful to us and our cousins alike, because we learn from it.</p>
<p>But there’s a problem.  As the old saying goes, “The cat, once burned, stays off hot stoves.  The trouble is, he stays off all stoves.”</p>
<p>In the Tea Party movement, we see the “all stoves” response to government.  Having spent a generation, from Reagan onwards, with a government that told them over and over that “government is the problem, not the solution,” while proving this point by changes in law and regulation that squeezed them and removed many protections,  they now have fully formed faith-distrust of anything called government.</p>
<p>The problem is that only government, good government, has the power and mandate to correct the maltreatment of bad government.  Not business, not finance, not private militias, not NGOs, not churches – only government.  Their faith-distrust cuts them off from the primary lifeboat &#8212; however leaky it may be &#8212; that can get them clear of the wreck.</p>
<p>Fact-trust is one of the elements of humanity that we can call &#8220;only human.&#8221;  To stand outside our own fears and use our minds to judge and our will to go against our habits and prejudices, is a very uncommon and very human skill.  Fact-trust is less rigid than faith-trust, and is subject to constant recalibration.  But it is the only guide that will equip the maltreated US public to choose correctly and comprehend the shell game they’ve been drawn into.</p>
<p>Whoever feeds you falsehoods feeds you poison, and whoever undercuts fact-trust and replaces it with faith-trust is blinkering and hobbling you, reducing your &#8220;only-humanity.&#8221;.  Faith-trust is not always injurious, but itself must be subject to scrutiny on a regular basis.  And what form might that scrutiny take?</p>
<p>I suggest another old saying:  “By their fruits shall ye know them.”</p>

                                <p>On my way out the door hopefully to score an iPad today. Meaning it is time for the haters to step up. I think this is going to be the greatest advance in human history since the second biggest advance, which of course was baked bread. (The biggest advance obviously being the genius that let grain spoil in exactly the right way to make beer.)</p>
<p>Some people have had iPads in their hands for 48 hours. Others are sickened to death over the hype. Here is your chance to express your opinion either way or on anything else at all prior to Bruce getting his hands on one.</p>
<p>Open tech thread. And yes I expect Ken H and I will have a colloquy on this.</p>
<p>(BTW as an additional hook. There is a theory that credits the transition from hunter/gathering to settled agriculture to the need to have a steady supply of grain to make beer. Not kidding at all.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Gates knew what many had forgotten: that Dr. Roberts had made an early and enduring contribution to modern computing. He created the MITS Altair, the first inexpensive general-purpose microcomputer, a device that could be programmed to do all manner of tasks. For that achievement, some historians say Dr. Roberts deserves to be recognized as the inventor of the personal computer. </p>
<p>For Mr. Gates, the connection to Dr. Roberts was also personal. It was writing software for the MITS Altair that gave Mr. Gates, a student at Harvard at the time, and his Microsoft partner, Paul G. Allen, their start. Later, they moved to Albuquerque, where Dr. Roberts had set up shop. </p>
<p>Dr. Roberts died Thursday at the Medical Center of Middle Georgia, his son Martin said. He was 68. </p>
<p>When the Altair was introduced in the mid-1970s, personal computers — then called microcomputers — were mainly intriguing electronic gadgets for hobbyists, the sort of people who tinkered with ham radio kits. </p>
<p>Dr. Roberts, it seems, was a classic hobbyist entrepreneur. He left his mark on computing, built a nice little business, sold it and moved on — well before personal computers moved into the mainstream of business and society&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Economic Views &#8211; a Thought Brought About by Yves Smith&#8217;s (Excellent Book) Econned</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still reading Econned, by Yves Smith. Sadly, these days I only have two minutes here or five minutes there. One day I will post something about everything going on right now, but that&#8217;s for another time.</p>
<p>Anyway, its not a breezy book, but if you are willing to put in the effort, it is perhaps the best critique of where the economics field is right now that I have come across. I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>But I do have a quibble. Smith talks about how economists have built up a practice that makes a fetish of using fancy and elegant math. However, doing so often requires crazy, unrealistic assumptions, which might be OK, except that the predictions usually have very little to do with the real world either. Thus, GIGO.</p>
<p>However, Smith notes that somehow, economists whose models are based on silly assumptions and produce unrealistic outcomes are nevertheless very respected and have a seat at the policy table &#8211; a seat, incidentally, that is denied to those who don&#8217;t understand the math &#038; models, or even other economists who think that unrealistic outcomes are a problem.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason I agree with Smith is that I&#8217;ve stated similar things here at AB for the past few years. Consider the following graph, variations of which I&#8217;ve posted a few times last year here at AB:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S7ke-i8CVtI/AAAAAAAAAAc/DDlfTxK6NGA/s1600/yves.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S7ke-i8CVtI/AAAAAAAAAAc/DDlfTxK6NGA/s320/yves.bmp"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>(Quick notes&#8230; the data comes from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2009&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaBox=no#Mid">the BEA&#8217;s NIPA Table 7.1</a>, and the graph shows the annualized change from the year before a President takes office to his last full year in office. For those leaving mid-term due to death or resignation, the last full year is the calendar year prior to departure if the Presidency ended in the first half o the calendar year. Note also that I&#8217;ve posted a few graphs showing that FDR still outperforms all comers even when you stop his term in 1938, in the middle of a big recession. Additionally, the Democrats outperform Republicans even if you eliminate the best performing Democrat and the worst performing Republican.)</p>
<p>Now, I like this graph because it is simple, and it makes a few points very easily. There is no amount of massaging this that can make it compatible with Republican/Austrian School/Libertarian dogma. (And yes, Obama isn&#8217;t on this&#8230; and he may yet underperform&#8230; but then, FDR inherited the Great Depression, and his first year was much worse than Obama&#8217;s.)</p>
<p>Personally, if I believed in Republican/Austrian School/Libertarian, I&#8217;d either be putting a heck of a lot of time and effort into explaining why the results don&#8217;t apply, or, if I could not come up with a home run explanation, I&#8217;d give up my views. And that, btw, is what happened. I graduated from high school in the mid-80s, and I believed in Reagan the way, well, folks who call themselves Republican/Austrian School/Libertarian believe in him now. But some time in college I started looking at data, and realized that the data simply didn&#8217;t match the pretty story, and my choice was to go with the data or go with the pretty story. The fact that members of these dogmas don&#8217;t know or care that reality doesn&#8217;t fit their beliefs makes me a bit leery of other things they believe in as well. And yet, Republican/Austrian School/Libertarian is now the dominant paradigm. Even most Democrats believe cutting taxes, for instance increases growth &#8211; they just feel that even so, in most cases, the non-growth related benefits of keeping taxes higher (say, to pay for certain programs) makes it worth not cutting taxes in many instances.</p>
<p>But Smith goes farther. Consider this: &#8220;the assume that only they are qualified to opine about matters economic.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with part of this. I don&#8217;t think one needs to be an economist to opine about matters economic, especially when so many economists hold views that contradict reality. But plenty of ordinary people have views that diverge from reality at least as much as your typical U of Chicago econ prof. My bet is that most people at a Tea Party gathering would consider the graph posted above to be a hoax. If they were paid to spend a few minutes working out the results themselves, that probably wouldn&#8217;t change their minds. My bet is most of them would simply get angry.</p>
<p>Economics is not rocket science. Its not even civil engineering. (And no, I do not want Joe Sixpack opining on exactly how much concrete should go into the bridge that I&#8217;ll be driving on, thank you very much.) So what can be done to make it more likely that people making decisions have at least some vague passing acquaintance with reality?<br />________________________-<br />by cactus</p>

<p>The GDP recovery is underway. But below the GDP hood, the picture is not as bright. The labor market is weak, and income-generating prospects remain muted. The latter portends a back-up of consumer spending down the road without substantial policy support.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/04/employment-report.html">Spencer&#8217;s post</a> for a very nice interpretation of today&#8217;s employment report, but he sums it up quite nicely:<br />
<blockquote>Yes, the employment situation has quit deteriorating, and there are encouraging details within the report. But the overall rebound in the economy and the employment situation is one of being stuck in the doldrums.</p></blockquote>
<p>But why is the U.S. economy stuck in the doldrums? Isn&#8217;t GDP recovering smartly? (Read on.)<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7YaKyh7UcI/AAAAAAAAC-s/grO__g9oBmU/s1600/gdp_chart.PNG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7YaKyh7UcI/AAAAAAAAC-s/grO__g9oBmU/s400/gdp_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart illustrates the GDP contraction for each recession since 1971, except that for 2001 because in sum <a href="http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">GDP did was rather flat</a>. Point &#8220;0&#8221; represents the quarter where GDP bottoms out. I circumvent the official date of the recession&#8217;s end as point 0 &#8211; <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">the NBER</a> is the agency that &#8220;dates&#8221; business cycles in the U.S. &#8211; because I want to focus on GDP, which is a composite of spending motives (including the government).</p>
<p>On the surface, the economy appears to be improving smartly; GDP bounced back 1.9% since its cyclical low in Q2 2009. But what we&#8217;ve really got here is a inventory-led recovery, with a Q3 boost from auto sales, and depreciated capital and software that must be replaced. Top that off with a small boost from non-defense federal government consumption, where in Q4 that was more than offset by the decline in the contribution to growth coming from state and local governments, and the recovery looks a little less stable.</p>
<p>I work in fixed income. Companies that wish to rollover debt or finance an expansion of capacity may do so through a public bond issuance. As an anecdote, companies will travel to our offices in order to &#8220;tell their story&#8221; and garner support for the issuance. Guess how many companies have told me that the proceeds of the bond issuance (essentially borrowing funds from the institutional investor at usually a fixed coupon rate) will finance expansion and new production capacity &#8211; none this year! Nada. (Actually, that&#8217;s not totally true: earlier this year an Indonesian power company wanted to rollover debt financed new capacity from last year.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty of <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/TCU?cid=3">spare  capacity</a>, so that existing resources can supply new demand. However,  this portends (in my very small sample) a slowdown in fixed investment growth,  and further crimps hopes for a strong recovery.</p>
<p>Jobs growth needs to pick up, or else income and earnings growth will continue down (or at best move sideways).<a href="javascript:void(0)" target=""><br /></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7YhQ6MNQKI/AAAAAAAAC_U/L3RWfhtGlHc/s1600/payroll_chart.PNG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7YhQ6MNQKI/AAAAAAAAC_U/L3RWfhtGlHc/s200/payroll_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7YhQcytq5I/AAAAAAAAC_M/c0HHqgydMsg/s1600/earnings_chart.PNG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7YhQcytq5I/AAAAAAAAC_M/c0HHqgydMsg/s200/earnings_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>It is NOT the time for government support to let up. Don&#8217;t worry about what markets think, worry about what people think. They can&#8217;t move; and they can&#8217;t find a job (well at least officially 9.7% of the labor force, or the 9.1m part-time for economic reasons workers). As such, the hope for sizable private-sector income growth is looking negligible.</p>
