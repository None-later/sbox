<p>Nate Silver, like essentially all election handycappers, ignores internal polls &#8212; polls financed by one of the candidates or by the party of one of the candidates.  Unusally, he explained why noting that even if the polls are unbiased there is extreme publication bias as campaigns release the polls if and only if they like the results.  I think that, if this is the explanation of the known bias in published internal polls, then internal polls should be included in averages of polls.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>update:  This post is basically a critique of <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/second-sestak-comeback-is-unlikely/">a post by Nate Silver</a> to which I didn&#8217;t link.  The assumptions I use below are based on things he conceded for the sake of argument.  He presents a simple formula which I critigue.  All quotes from the post are updates.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m not sure why people take polls released by campaigns at face value. This does not mean that campaigns don’t have very good pollsters working for them. But the subset of polls which they release to the general public is another matter, and are almost always designed to drive media narrative.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the polls are OK when conducted, but the choice to release the polls is strategic and therefore the polls should not be taken &#8220;at face value.&#8221; </p>
<blockquote><p>What we’ve found is that is that polls commissioned by campaigns and released to the public show, on average, a result that is about 6 points points more favorable to their candidate’s standing than nonpartisan polls released at the same time. (Other analysts have found similar results.) So, just as a first cut, you might take a Democratic internal poll that shows a tied race and “translate” it into nonpartisan terms by adding 6 points to the Republican’s margin.</p></blockquote>
<p>I note the weasel phrase &#8220;as a first cut&#8221; and argue below that a better first cut is to just include internal polls unadjusted if, as Silver semi asserts in the first quoted passage, the problem is just publication bias.  The rough 6% correction is definitely not the best first cut.  I say 0% is best but 6% is definitely too much because of a universally accepted argument discussed below.</p>
<p>end update </p>
<p>All campaigns appear to believe that reporting a poll which would be good for the candidate if accurate is definitely good for the candidate (they believe in a bandwaggon effect.  So the publication bias hypothesis makes sense.  I am going to make absolutely key unsupported assumptions in order to write down a model.  Then I will pretend the model is reality.</p>
<p>There are two candidates A and B.<br />Assume that there is an unbiased agreed upon average of consensus based on public polls &#8212; A ahead by dpublic.  Assume each campaign conducts one unbiased poll and that these polls are of equal quality (same sample size etc).  Assume A releases A&#8217;s poll if it shows A ahead by more than dpublic and B releases B&#8217;s poll if it shows A ahead by less than dpublic.</p>
<p>Claim 1: Then the average including internal polls is an unbiased estimate of the expected value of the actual vote.  </p>
<p>Proof: everything is symmetric around A ahead by dpublic so the A&#8217;s expected lead including the internal polls is dpublic which is assumed to be unbiased.</p>
<p>Claim 2: the variance of the average including the internal polls will be lower.</p>
<p>Non proof: This is obvious it is an average with an equal or larger denominator.</p>
<p>So what are the key assumptions ?  First I don&#8217;t really need to assume one internal poll each, but I do need to assume equal numbers of internal polls run by both campaigns.  Second I need more for symmetry.  I need that the internal polls are all unbiased and that they have equal variance.  Also I need that the rule for publishing them is the same for both campaigns.</p>
<p>Silver seems inclined to assume, for the sake of argument, that internal polls are generally reputable polls with bias due to publication bias.  It seems to me that the key issue is the assumption that each side actually performs the same number (really approximately the same number).  </p>
<p>This is clearly not true if a well financed campaign competes with a poorly financed campaign.  This means that results including internal polls will depend partly on current public opinion and partly on which campaign has more money.  The same is true of election outcomes.  I&#8217;d consider that a feature not a bug.</p>
<p>My reasoning is used in informal discussions.  The fact that a campaign hasn&#8217;t released an internal is interpreted as bad news for that campaign.  It is assumed that they ran polls and didn&#8217;t like the results.  Consider what <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2010/10/23/912932/-Polling-and-Political-Wrap,-10-23-10">Steve Singiser just typed.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Louisiana looks competitive for the first time in months, at least according to a Dem poll. As of this afternoon, we haven&#8217;t seen the retaliatory GOP internal poll, suggesting that the Dem poll might at least be in the wheelhouse.</p></blockquote>
<p>No one seems to doubt that this argument is valid, yet it is excluded from Silver&#8217;s model and from the more primitive polling averages presented by others.</p>
<p>update 2: Silver&#8217;s proposed 6% correction ignores this factor.  Now ignoring all internal polls will not introduce bias, but including internal polls with the 6% correction will introduce bias in my example in the case in which only one internal poll is reported.</p>
<p>end update 2.</p>
<p>I think my alleged proof is rigorous, but it is very brief and I will tell stories to explain.</p>
<p>There are four possibilities<br />1. Both internals give better results for A than the consensus based on independent polls<br />2. Both internals give better results for B <br />3. The poll conducted by A gives better results for A and the poll conducted by B gives better results for B<br />4.The poll conducted by A gives better results for B and the poll conducted by B gives better results for A</p>
<p>In case 4, no internal polls are released so the average including (hypothetical reported internals) is just the average based on independent polls.<br />In case 3 each internal poll is published.  Each is biased (by selection) each is equally biased in opposite directions.  The final average is unbiased and based on a larger sample (with a larger denominator) so it has lower variance than the average independent poll.</p>
<p>The interesting cases are 1 and 2.  I will explain case 1, since they are symmetric.  In case 1 one poll is included in the average.  It&#8217;s distribution is biased by selection.  However, the fact that the Poll run by campaign B gave an lead for A greater than dpublic is not included at all in calculating the average.  The two biases exactly cancel.  It is sufficient but not necessary to note that the distributions of (internal poll minus average of independent polls) are symmetric around 0.  It is necessary that the two internal polls have the same distribution (the bit about equal quality).</p>
<p>update 3: I haven&#8217;t shown you the proof of this new claim.  It actually adds something to the obvious claim based on symmetry.  It means that not only is there no unconditional bias, but also there is no bias conditional on being in case 1 and similarly there is no bias in case 2.  This means that Silver&#8217;s proposed &#8220;first cut&#8221; is not the correct formula given Silver&#8217;s data.   The fact that one campaign is not releasing internal poll results means something and the 6% correction is based on the assumption that it means exactly nothing.  I&#8217;d say a better first cut is 0%, but I am absolutely sure that a 5% correction is better than a 6% correction (I&#8217;m willing to bet a modest amount of money on it using exactly the same data Silver used to calculate the 6%)</p>
<p>end update 3.</p>
<p>Now someone at DailyKos noted (I think it was Steve Slingiser to whom I linked above) that averages including internals performed better than averages of independent polls in past cycles. I claim that I have an explanation of that fact which is perfectly consistent with the very significant bias in publicly reported internals.</p>
<p>Second, my argument for including internals will cease to hold if it is adopted.  If it is known that internal polls are believed, the incentive to deliberately bias them increases until the effect of including them becomes a bias in favor of the less honest campaign.  No campaign is very honest, but they do differ, so, if indeed they are not cooking the internal polls now, it would be better if people ignored the internal polls at the cost of not knowing so well how elections will turn out.</p>
<p>Not being Kant, I will include internal polls in my averages.</p>
<p>update 4:  I haven&#8217;t proven any of my mathematical claims after the first (at most) but I will add one more for the patient reader.  Even if internal polls are biased (not just reported internal polls but also the numbers which might or might not be biased) they should be included if both campaigns have the same bias and the same symmetric distribution around that biased mean, both know the bias and both report the poll if it is better for their candidate than they expected given the bias.</p>
<p>as in the non proof of the cliams of no bias in cases 1 and 2 works just as well.</p>
<p>A simpler way to put the new claim is that if half of internal polls are reported, and those are the half which are better for the campaign which financed the polling, then the best approach is to include internal polls in the average just as if they were independent.  This is true even if internal polls are biased (and it&#8217;s not just that published internal polls are biased due to publication bias).</p>
<p>If more than half of internal polls are reported on average, then the simple average  UNDERestimates the expected vote share of the campaign which reports the internal poll.  The fact that the other campaign didn&#8217;t report it&#8217;s poll contains lots and lots of information if campaigns usually report their internal polls. More generally for many internal polls run but equal numbers by each campaign this means that my 0% correction for internal polls is too high if most internal polls are reported.</p>
<p>This is always assuming a lot of symmetry, importantly symmetry in the number of internal polls run and symmetric bias (indeed mirror image distributions) and symmetric rules for what to publish.</p>

<p><strong>Democrats touting tax cuts </strong><br />crossposted with Ataxingmatter</p>
<p>The New York Times ran a story this week about the Obama tax cuts&#8211;the point?  while the Tea Partiers rage against the Obama administration because they want more tax cuts, they have missed the fact of substantial tax cuts under the Obama administration.  See Michael Cooper, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/us/politics/19taxes.html">From Obama, the Tax Cut Nobody Heard of</a>, NY Times, Oct. 18, 2010 (noting that a reporter&#8217;s query at a Republican gathering ifound most commenters saying that their taxes had gone up under Obama and a NY Times, CBS News POll that showed that fewer than 1 in 10 Americans knew that Obama had cut taxes for most Americans, with a third mistakenly thinking their taxes had increased under Obama).
</p>
<p>The reason for the failure to notice.  It might be partly the vast expenditure of funds to support misleading propaganda that claims that the Obama administration&#8217;s policies are terrible for ordinary Americans.  But it is at least in part because of the design of the economic stimulus tax cuts&#8211;intended to let the tax relief arrive in paycheck after paycheck (about $65 a month for typical families) so that it would be spent and thus help the economy, rather than arriving in a lump sum that might more likely be used as savings/debt reduction that would have less of an effect on the economy, coupled with the fact that the recession was cutting into spending money as businesses cut back, construction workers worked less, state services declined and, in at least 30 states, state taxes rose (see CBPP,<a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&#038;id=711"> States Continue to Feel Recession&#8217;s Impact</a>, Oct. 7, 2010), and deductions for the ever-spiralling health insurance bills increased. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a> </p>
<p>[Of course, this will all be much worse for many if the Tea Party candidates dominate in the elections.  The ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, for example, &#8220;calls for a radical redistribution of resources from the broad majority of Americans to the nation&#8217;s wealthiest individuals&#8221; including a plan that &#8220;provides the largest tax cuts in history for the wealthy,raises taxes on the middle class, ends guaranteed Medicare benefits, erodes health care coverage, partial privatizes Social Security, and makes deep cuts in guaranteed Social Security benefits.&#8221;  <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&#038;id=3308">Ryan Plan Makes Deep Cuts in Social Security</a>, CBPP, Oct. 20, 2010.  See <a href="http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Roadmap2Final2.pdf">Ryan Roadmap </a>(introduced as H.R. 4529).]</p>
<p>The Democrats didn&#8217;t miss a beat in putting out a &#8220;fact sheet&#8221; to help people understand the range of tax cuts included in the stimulus bill and other legislation passed under Obama. See &#8220;<a href="http://dpc.senate.gov/dpcdoc.cfm?doc_name=fs-111-2-166">Democrats Cut Taxes by $509 Billion, Putting Taxes at Lowest Level Since 1950</a>&#8220;, Democratic Policy Committee, Oct. 20, 2010.

                                <p>I present an update on aggregate demand using the highest frequency of economic data available, US Treasury tax receipts. Tax receipts serve as a proxy for nominal aggregate demand via a nominal indicator of private payroll growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/dts/index.html">US daily Treasury tax receipts </a>are improving. (This chart has been modified since its original posting to enable reader to click to enlarge).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TMRIScXWCMI/AAAAAAAADTk/9hhAOvtI2aU/s1600/US_Treasury_Receipt_chart.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TMRIScXWCMI/AAAAAAAADTk/9hhAOvtI2aU/s400/US_Treasury_Receipt_chart.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><a name="more"></a>The chart illustrates the federal deposits of income and employment taxes that are recorded on a daily basis and presented here as the annual pace of the 30-day rolling sum. The red line illustrates the average annual growth rate spanning the period 2005-current.</p>
<p>Since roughly April of 2010, the annual pace of income and employment tax receipts has been above the average, 2.8%. In the third quarter, the annual pace of income and employment tax receipts remained around 4%, consistent with the second quarter pace. Hours and employment are improving, supporting wage gains and higher tax receipts. But more importantly, the pace of tax receipt growth has not faltered, demonstrating ongoing recovery in the labor market and consumer demand.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not enough. The gains in tax receipts are likely a function of firms adding back hours instead of pumping up the work force. (see my previous post with links on the &#8220;<a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/06/hourless-recovery.html">hourless recovery</a>&#8220;).</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TMNHed_SEHI/AAAAAAAADTU/0GMBq9jW0oU/s1600/hours_payroll_chart.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TMNHed_SEHI/AAAAAAAADTU/0GMBq9jW0oU/s400/hours_payroll_chart.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart above illustrates the cyclical loss from recession and gains during the recovery of private net-jobs (payroll) and aggregate weekly hours (you can see the summary data from the September payroll report <a href="http://bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm">here</a>).</p>
<p>Both series found a trough in the third quarter of 2009, which is consistent with the bottom in tax receipt growth (chart above). However, the hours index has recovered quicker than has its payroll counterpart (of course it fell farther, too). To date, both private hours and payroll are 7% short of their values at the peak of the economic cycle.</p>
<p>Receipts are growing, but not vigorously enough to indicate any shift in the current trajectory of payroll growth. Therefore, nominal aggregate demand remains weak. Furthermore, the still-nascent household deleveraging cycle is very likely moving at snail-speed (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/04/reducing-household-financial-leverage.html">see this article for a discussion of the link between consumption growth, income growth, and deleveraging</a> for today&#8217;s commentary).</p>

                                <p>I have (vainly, I suspect, in both senses of the phrase), tried to start a meme on Twitter, #ifTimGeithnerrantheEmergencyRoom. “The defibrillator would only charge to 30 to prevent scarring; anything more and you’re on your own” probably isn’t winning friends or influencing people, but it does make me feel better.
<p>It also makes me look back at the histories written of the time.  A detailed analysis of Keynes’s discussion of Goldman Sachs’s antics in the late 1920s, which echo their trading in middle 2000s, is left to someone else. (Suffice it to say, one never quite listens to John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads” the same way again after reading about Blue Ridge and Shenandoah.)</p>
<p>It’s the macro monetary moves that abide, and the lessons of history. Years ago, people failed to notice that money whose multiplier is 1 is not inflationary—most especially when you have one of the so-called “balance sheet recessions” where assets are being carried at a value significantly higher than can be realized even in Edward C. Prescott’s or Thomas M. Hoenig’s most lurid fantasies.  To wit:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over time, Fed officials became increasingly concerned about substantial increases in bank reserves, especially excess reserves. During 1934 and 1935, gold inflows of some $3 billion contributed to a doubling of member bank total reserves (from $2.76 billion in January 1934 to $5.72 billion in December 1935) and more than a tripling of excess reserves (from $866 million to $2.98 billion; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 1943, 371). The buildup of excess reserves alarmed Fed officials, who feared that these “idle” balances might permit a wave of speculation and inflation.</p>
<p>Using its traditional tools the Fed would have reduced reserves (or slowed their rate of growth) by selling securities and raising the discount rate. But this was not feasible in the mid-1930s. A discount rate increase would have had no effect on reserves since discount-window borrowing already was trivial, even at a discount rate of just 1.5 percent. Similarly, by mid-1935, member bank excess reserves alone equaled the Fed’s total security holdings, leaving the Fed unable to slow significantly the growth of total reserves through open market sales….</p>

<p>And the result, Basel III-like, of ignoring that the accounting Fantasies of Solvency were dwarfing the lending realities: </p>
<blockquote><p>Alarmed at the sharp increase in excess reserves that had taken place since 1933, and viewing it as potentially inflationary, the Board of Governors increased required reserve ratios in August 1936, and again in March and May 1937. In total, the reserve requirements on time deposits were increased from 3 percent to 6 percent. Requirements on demand deposits were increased from 7, 10, and 13 percent to 14, 20, and 26 percent for country, reserve city, and central reserve city banks, respectively. The increases, according to the Annual Report of the Board of Governors for 1936, were intended to eliminate those excess reserves the board deemed ‘‘superfluous for prospective needs of commerce, industry, and agriculture, and, if permitted to become the basis of a multiple expansion of bank credit, might have resulted in an injurious credit expansion” (14).</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann is pleased to note that he <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/05/bullet-dodged.html">was</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/03/geithner-plan-better-than-leaked.html">right</a> and that Paul Krugman and Joeseph Stiglitz were wrongggg.  They claimed that PPIP was a huge giveaway, because purchases of toxic assets would be 85% financed by no-recourse loans from the FDIC.  I noted that this financing would only be available if the FDIC (not just Treasury) agreed, and that the FDIC had no intention of being taken to the cleaners.</p>
<p>Now I read that, so far, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-22/ppip-funds-surge-36-on-average-in-first-year-treasury-says.html">PPIP has generated a 36% annual return for the Treasury.</a>  That&#8217;s not the point. The point is that it has generated approximately no profit or loss for the FDIC, because the FDIC refused to be played for suckers.  They key sentence is<br />
<blockquote>The Treasury is an equal equity partner in each of the funds and provided debt financing for the $29.4 billion program.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that the acronym FDIC doesn&#8217;t appear.  </p>

<p>Krugman not considered a competent data downloader in the Newspaper which employees him.</p>
<p>Writing about the new slashed budget proposed in the UK, Landon Thomas Jr <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/world/europe/21austerity.html">sees invisible bond vigilantes</a> </p>
<p>&#8221; bond market demands to follow through on promised austerity plans.&#8221;  If this means anything it means that, before the announcement of the austerity bond prices were unusually low and/or falling sharply.  In fact, <a href="http://www.ftadviser.com/InvestmentAdviser/Investments/Sector/UK/UKGilt/Features/article/20101011/5818712e-cc7e-11df-8c2a-00144f2af8e8/Analyst-Henderson-UK-Gilt.jsp">bond prices were extraordinarily high.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you look at the real yields available in index linked gilts, even out to 2017 – seven years time – the real yield available on a index linked gilt is close to zero. That is telling you that rates are going to stay very low,&#8221; he claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;When people are using an historic onset to base where 10 year gilts should be, the zero real yield is a very unusual situation, it would typically be closer to 2.5 per cent. Unless you are willing to say that the real yield is wrong and, as such, argue that the BoE are about to start hiking rates, I don’t think you can say that gilts are inevitably going to give you a poor return.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Mr Apel </p></blockquote>
<p>Most bond traders might be claiming they are worried about the deficit, but, if so, they are lying.  The bond market says that the default risk is miniscule.</p>
<p>I propose we take up a collection to buy Mr Thomas a subscription to the New York Times.</p>

                                <p>By Daniel Becker</p>
<p>We all know the arguments about the loss of good jobs. Automation, competition, outsourcing. We&#8217;ve been told that America was striking out to raise it&#8217;s status when it came to jobs. Don&#8217;t lament the loss of those blue collar manufacturing jobs to cheap labor. They aren&#8217;t worth it. Step up. The new jobs will pay more if you get educated. Well, an entire generation got educated, and they are now looking for a job that will just keep them at their status quo. </p>
<p>We seem fixated on just this singular aspect of the decline of the middle class. Well, there is an entire sector of our economy that was and is just as important to growing and keeping a middle class: Retail.</p>
<p>The entire economic focus on finance to the point of believing that all that is important to having a successful economy is to keep improving the efficiency of money has not only generated a formula for making money from money (CDO, CDS, ABS, subprime, leasing, arbitrage, shorting, longing, etc, etc, etc) it has also convinced us and made us act on the idea that consolidation is efficient and that efficiency is growth. The old &#8220;economies of scale&#8221; thingy. </p>
<p>Well, here from my friend is what he recalls of main street in Central Fall, RI. This is what we lost as a pathway into middle class for the sake of &#8220;efficiency&#8221;.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;When I was younger, Dexter Street was alive with activity. Anything you needed you could purchase on Dexter Street. There was a shoe store, two hardware stores, a jeweler, two bakeries, three or four restaurants, about 5 bars, a military store, two pharmacies, three barber shops, two liquor stores, about four of five variety stores, two meat markets and a fish store. They are all gone.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s is not just the loss of the mills. Central Falls et al could have survived at a much greater level of prosperity if the people had not lost the only path to actually receiving benefit from outsourcing. But, with outsourcing came consolidation in not just manufacturing, but also in the end point distribution of all that consolidated manufacturing: Retail. The efficiency gained of the dollar producing a product outside the USA was consolidated by the move to consolidate the retail part (and wholesale too). The lack of share of productivity gains to the masses is not just do to the loss of manufacturing. It is also do to the loss of access to retailing. </p>
<p>Sure, we all thought it was grand buying something for much less than what Dexter Street Hardware USA could sell it for.  We had more money in our pockets after the purchase.  How&#8217;s your community doing now?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just industrial New England that lost retail as represented in the loss of &#8220;Main Street USA&#8221;, you know we are hearing of the destruction of the &#8220;heartland America&#8221; main street. I&#8217;m not talking about the loss of the cultural experience that &#8220;Main Street USA&#8221; represented, though there is that. We closed down for the sake of money efficiency, the other primary path to become middle class. In doing so, we also reduced the movement and thus booking of dollars within the local community. One dollar on Dexter Street, Central Falls, RI could potentially be booked in 31 businesses just by the owner of the business. Even if with that one dollar divided among the employees, that dollar still for the most part stayed in the community to be booked potentially 30 times. One dollar in Big Box Mall USA is divided up such that only a few cents per employee gets booked in the local community with the rest going up line to the few. </p>
<p>No, the trades related to construction can not make up for the loss of independent retail.  Retail was a major cylinder in the small business engine of our economy.  It was also a major path to political reality and activism.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time we start broadening the discussion to beyond just money efficiency. Just as with the concept of the &#8220;free lunch&#8221; tax cut, that is, that there is no free lunch to growth via tax cuts so is it true with efficiency based on the slogan of &#8220;economies of scale&#8221; when talking about money&#8217;s roll in the entirety of society. That we can buy stuff from overseas cheaper at Big Box Mall USA is not enough of an answer to accepting this paradigm. </p>
