                                <p>I have an interesting opportunity for you guys at Angry Bear!  First<br />off, thank you for your continued support of Facing Up to the Nation&#8217;s<br />Finances.  Now, however, I am writing about the presidential debates.<br />Please read the letter below and let me know if you&#8217;re interested:</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Billy Hallowell and I am the director of content<br />here at VoterWatch.  We are reaching out to you today to discuss &#8220;The<br />Presidential Debates Project&#8221; &#8212; an exciting new project that we&#8217;d<br />like to invite you to participate in.  &#8220;The Presidential Debates<br />Project&#8221; is intended to bring together traditional journalists,<br />bloggers and prominent minds from the left and right in an innovative<br />and informative manner.  Using our technology, these individuals will<br />blog within live video coverage of the four presidential/one<br />vice-presidential debates.</p>
<p>A major component of our work at VoterWatch&#8217;s is our innovative video<br />player technology.  This technology allows users to insert commentary<br />(fact checks, links, corroborative content, etc.) within video.  The<br />commentary then scrolls alongside the video.   The &#8220;Presidential<br />Debates Project&#8221; aggregates coverage that encompasses hard news and<br />opinion.  Each journalist would have his or her commentary presented<br />on the corresponding outlet&#8217;s web site or blog.  Then, we will air all<br />of the content on our web site, providing an intriguing record for the<br />public to view following each debate.  This project is the perfect<br />opportunity to air the event, while inserting commentary, hard news<br />and/or perspective for your visitors.</p>
<p>Update:First, thanks for posting this! Secondly, this is very different. Our tool is about an interactive presentation that in synced collectively to specific points within video. www.voterwatch.org<br />Billy Hallowell </p>
<p>The goal of our project is to bring together numerous perspectives on<br />American politics as well as non-partisan annotations in order to have<br />the electorate not only more informed, but also more motivated to<br />understand the realities behind what the candidates are saying.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing your potential involvement in this project.<br />&#8212; <br />Sincerely,<br />Billy Hallowell<br />Director of Content, VoterWatch<br />www.voterwatch.org<br />&#8220;The Congressional Record You&#8217;ve Always Wanted&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>So here&#8217;s the part where I get confused. The only way to balance our current account is to stop importing more than we export. In other words, we need to reduce our net consumption of foreign goods and services, which almost certainly means an overall reduction in our consumption of goods and services too.  On the other hand, a credit-induced recession demands that we stimulate consumption. Otherwise we fall even deeper into recession.  So which is it? Increase consumption in order to keep our current recession from turning into a depression, or reduce consumption in order to avoid long-term disaster caused by a growing current-account deficit? Can we somehow do both with an export-driven boom? Is there another option I&#8217;m not taking seriously enough? Or are we just screwed?</p></blockquote>
<p>Jan Tinbergen’s <em>Economic Policy: Principles and Design</em> points out that if you have two policy problems – as in weak aggregate demand and a current account deficit – but only one policy tool (expenditure-adjusting policies such as those that impact domestic consumption), then one is indeed screwed.   But we do have <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/01/china-and-us-macroeconomic-policies.html">expenditure-switching</a> options.  I have long favored policies that would lead to dollar devaluation so we could generate even more of an export-driven boom even if John McCain and Lawrence Kudlow want a stronger dollar.</p>

                                <p>The traditional annual list of Party Schools now has a jump-start. In no particular order, except the way <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/08/18/college.drinking.age.ap/index.html">CNN listed them</a>:
<ol>Duke<br />Dartmouth<br />Ohio State<br />Syracuse<br />Tufts<br />Colgate<br />Kenyon<br />Morehouse<br />Middlebury College<br />Rhodes College</ol>
<p>The reasoning is such that Only the <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/08/i-was-so-pleased-to-be-informed-of-this.html">Current Attorney General</a> could love:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;This is a law that is routinely evaded,&#8221; said John McCardell, former president of Middlebury College in Vermont who started the organization. &#8220;It is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Is routinely evaded&#8221; is College President-speak for &#8220;The system is broken, <strong>so</strong> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/passive-voice-makes-for-never-proven.html">I&#8217;m not responsible</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since this reasoning also applies to most recreational drug consumption, including but not limited to marijuana, crack, cocaine, and Ecstasy, I expect the Amethyst Initiative to move on to those areas next.</p>
<p>It falls to a former Clinton Administration official to tell the truth and shame the Devil,* in around the 16th or 17th graf:<br />
<blockquote> But some other college administrators sharply disagree that lowering the drinking age would help. University of Miami President Donna Shalala, who served as secretary of health and human services under President Clinton, declined to sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember college campuses when we had 18-year-old drinking ages, and I honestly believe we&#8217;ve made some progress,&#8221; Shalala said in a telephone interview. &#8220;To just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And it is even later in the piece that they point out that the researcher whose work the Amethyst Initiative cites not only disagrees, but sees through the facade:<br />
<blockquote> McCardell cites the work of Alexander Wagenaar, a University of Florida epidemiologist and expert on how changes in the drinking age affect safety. But Wagenaar himself sides with MADD in the debate.</p>
<p>The college presidents &#8220;see a problem of drinking on college campuses, and they don&#8217;t want to deal with it,&#8221; Wagenaar said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s really unfortunate, but the science is very clear.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2008/08/things-are-progessing-swimmingly.html">Things are progessing swimmingly</a></p>
<p>For me, that is&#8230; in terms of my economical prognostication.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll beat my own drum yet again &#8211; I know you&#8217;re all sick of someone saying &#8220;I told you so&#8221; but I still can&#8217;t understand why high priced financial analysts can make a living out of getting it wrong while little old me has to sit here and remember that I first heard the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude">&#8220;Schadenfreude&#8221;</a> explained on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Flanders_Failed">The Simpsons</a>.</p>
<p>So, anyway. Here&#8217;s what I said back in <a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2008/01/slow-demolition-of-us-economy.html">January 2008</a>:<br />What I am therefore predicting in 2008 is a period of painful stagflation for America &#8211; a combination of economic contraction and inflation which will only be solved when the Fed raises rates and plunges the economy into a double-dip recession.<br />And <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=amisOhrnjyh4&#038;refer=home">here&#8217;s the latest</a>:<br />U.S. consumer prices rose more than forecast in July, indicating Federal Reserve policy makers have reason to be concerned over a pickup in inflation.</p>
<p>The consumer price index climbed 0.8 percent, twice as much as anticipated, the Labor Department said today in Washington. The cost of living was up 5.6 percent in the year ended in July, the biggest jump in 17 years. So-called core prices, which exclude food and energy, also rose more than projected.</p>
<p>The report may intensify the debate between those Fed policy makers that forecast inflation will slow and those concerned that price pressures will accelerate. Increases beyond food and fuel, including gains in clothing, airline fares and education, make it less likely that central bankers will be able to keep interest rates unchanged for long.<br />According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misery_index_%28economics%29">Misery Index</a>, inflation of 5.6% plus unemployment of 5.7% equals a misery rate of 11.3. The <a href="http://www.miseryindex.us/indexbymonth.asp">last time it was this high was in June 1991</a> when it hit 11.60. The highest in 17 years. The Misery Index is a hard and fast index that is useful at measuring stagflation (but is not without its faults).</p>
<p>So anyway, I&#8217;ll just continue to sit here laughing maniacally and feeling good about all the emotional and economic suffering in the US while millionaire financial analysts continue to get it wrong.</p>

<p>
<blockquote>Is when Unemployment is 5% or more and when Inflation is 5% or more at the same time.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.miseryindex.us/raw_data.asp">raw data at the Misery Index site</a>, the US experienced my definition of stagflation during the following periods:</p>
<p>July 1970 &#8211; February 1971 (Unemployment average 5.6%, Inflation 5.52%, 8 months)</p>
<p>April 1973 (Un-5.0% and Inf-5.06%, 1 month)</p>
<p>January 1974 &#8211; October 1976 (Un-7.24% and Inf-8.88%, 34 months)</p>
<p>January 1977 &#8211; October 1982 (Un-7.14% and Inf-9.38%, 70 months)</p>
<p>April 1989 &#8211; June 1989 (Un-5.23% and Inf-5.22%, 3 months)</p>

<p>If the capability &#8220;gaps&#8221; were properly characterized, the whittle this week demonstrates that technical processes are not executed to deliver the capability to close the &#8220;gap&#8221;.</p>
<p>GAO again gives some findings to work from. <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08619.pdf">&#8220;A Knowledge Based Funding Approach Could Improve Major Weapon System Program Outcomes&#8221;</a>. July 2008.</p>
<p>The finding include: &#8220;For a majority of the weapon system programs GAO reviewed, costs have exceeded the funding levels initially planned for and reflected in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP)—DOD’s investment strategy. To compensate for these shortfalls, DOD makes unplanned and inefficient funding adjustments, like moving money from one program to another, deferring costs into the future, or reducing procurement quantities.&#8221;</p>
<p>This sometimes happens because the programs are started without enough money is not in the 5 year budget. I have seen that more often than I care to remember, objective evaluations asked the questions but no one wanted to see or acknowledge that there was not enough money. Failed development occurs because of other issues as well.</p>
<p>A few lines later: &#8220;DOD’s flawed funding process is largely driven by decision makers’ willingness to accept unrealistic cost estimates and DOD’s commitment to more programs than it can support. DOD often underestimates development costs—due in part to a lack of knowledge and optimistic assumptions about requirements and critical technologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The technical manager comes to the civilian decision makers; Service Acquisition Executives who are sponsoring their folks to get their share of the big bucks, and Defense Acquisition Executives equally motivated to waste the taxpayers scarce resources, with wildly understated cost estimates, supporting equally ,underfunded budgets to deliver ill suited performance specifications, to design something to fill the &#8220;gap&#8221;. The result will not deliver any combat capability to fill the &#8220;gap&#8221;. The program manager, making wild and often misleading statements, tells them his team can meet the &#8220;gap&#8221; just trust them.</p>
<p>In the end the decision makers do &#8220;trust&#8221; them. They go off and spend a lot of money and when they run out they come back for more money with nothing to show for the expenditure.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by no one questioning the program manager and criticizing their assumptions about the job and their ability to do the job. The estimates are wishful thinking and their budgets are inadequate. It is very much like ignoring the elephant in the room. The elephant is the lack of knowledge in the decision process that can be seen concerning the technology to be applied, whether it can close the capability gap, if it can be manufactured and if it could be integrated with other systems and the battle plan. All of those unasked concerns have consequences which make costs rise and take more time to do the work, if it is ever completed.</p>
<p>Management by wishful thinking and casting the dice rather than knowledge is the hallmark. The civilian decision makers are complicit rubes being taken by the program office con men.</p>

<p>Might as well whittle beaks than send a group of defense complex elite out to try and fix their own mess.</p>
<p>I find this quote appropriate in the ongoing mess; the management of the US &#8220;regard inexcusable failures and errors with too tolerant an eye……” Ike Oct 1942 from An Army at Dawn pg. 60</p>
<p>Next week I shift from wishful thinking in budget reviews to wishful thinking in technical reviews! Warning could be Tanta style wonky.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/added-commentary-on-questionable.html">rdan</a> and <a href="http://www.moonofalabama.org/2008/08/amity-shlaes-fo.html#more">Moon of Alabama</a> for realizing that the BEA provides certain macroeconomic data that would help follow-up on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/amity-shlaes-on-alleged-damage-to.html">my criticisms</a> of the latest garbage from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/17/AR2008081702079.html">Amy Schlaes</a>.  But let’s graph real GDP rather than nominal GDP – please.  Your qualitative statements still hold and if we also graph the components of aggregate demand (CON = consumption, INV = investment, GOV = government purchases, EX = exports, and IM = imports), we can really show what an uninformed rightwing dolt Ms. Schlaes happens to be.  </p>
<p>Yes – real GDP did quite well after FDR took office as did investment demand.  Now Ms. Schlaes does complain that the government got too big but wouldn’t most macroeconomists argue that the rise in government purchases lead to a rise in aggregate demand, which augmented the rise in domestic private spending (consumption and investment) as we recovered from the Great Depression?  I also find fascinating the behavior of exports and imports.  While it is true that exports fell from 1929 to 1932, imports fell even more.  So with net exports rising – Ms. Schlaes seems to be at a loss to explain how these trade balance effects lead to the Great Depression.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Since others agreed in the prior post that the depression chart would be better in real dollars rather than nominal dollars I though I would take this opportunity to post this chart.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKnMuRZ9ZRI/AAAAAAAAAXc/yjg86C2WP2c/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKnMuRZ9ZRI/AAAAAAAAAXc/yjg86C2WP2c/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>In business cycle analysis if you use NBER official terminology the cyle should be divided into three phases.  The first is recession from the peak in economic activity to the bottom. The second is recovery from the bottom in economic activity until the  the previous peak  is reached.<br />The third phase is the expansion from when the prior peak is surpassed until the next peak.</p>
<p>The second part of this chart is a basic forecasting rule I developed years ago that recessions&#8211; recoveries are symmetrical.  That is the recovery period is almost always the same length as the recession.  If the economy falls for 4 quarters it should take it 4 quarters to regain the prior peak and on average that is what happened in post WW II recession. In other words, mild recessions have weak recoveries and deep recessions have strong recoveries.  You can see that in the dashed line in the chart above.  Also note that the dashed line is quarterly data while the solid line showing the 1930s is annual data.  The BEA only published annual data for the 1930s.</p>
<p>If you look at the 1929 to 1936 period it is obvious that this rule worked well.  The downturn was four years from 1929 to 1933 and the recovery was three years from  1933 to 1936 when real GDP surpassed the 1929 peak. According to the NBER the bottom was in March, 1933, the very month FDR took office. If we had quarterly data it would look even more like the 1929-36 recession&#8211;recovery was symmetrical ,just like the post WW II recession &#8212; recoveries.</p>
<p>We have a massive sub-industry in the economics profession claiming that the depression recovery was weak.  But this chart actually suggest that the 1933-36 recovery was very strong by post WW II standards because after falling for four years the economy only took three  years to surpass the 1929 peak.  In the chart I put the bottom in 1933 and in post WW II recession at the same point on the scale so the 1929 peak is placed earlier then the post-war peaks.  So this chart says that all the analysis blaming Roosevelt and the new deal for a weak recovery is just plain incorrect.  The recovery was not weak in comparison to other recoveries.</p>
<p>Where you get the difference is in 1937-38. In a normal economic cycle this would be the expansion when growth is normally above trend and  in the 1930s the economy clearly had the capacity to grow at 8%-9% rates in 1937-38 as it did in 1939 and 1940.</p>
<p>But in 1937-38 the US had a recession rather than growing at 8% to 9%.  this difference is why the good economists are correct in saying the recovery in the depression was weak.  Of course, this raises the question of why there was a recession in 1937-38 and that is open to debate.<br />I personally blame the Fed just as the Fed was the single most important reason for the 1929-33 collapse.  In late 1936 the Fed became very worried that the economy was too strong and would generate inflation.  So they raised reserve requirements, a tightening move that caused the 1937-38 recession just as such tightening moves generally cause recessions.  If this analysis is correct it implies that the analysis by Amy Shlaes and other blaming the New Deal are completely without any basis.</p>

<p>A. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot-Hawley_Tariff_Act">Smoot Hawley Tariff Act</a>The first misstep according to Shlaes was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act which increased tariffs on imports to the U.S. by up to 50%. It was put into law in June 1930 by the Republican congress under Hoover. That would be at point A on the GDP chart. Smoot-Hawley was indeed bad. </p>
<p>B. Democrats took over Congress in November 1932 and in early 1933 appointed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecora_Commission">Ferdinand Pecora</a> as commission counselor. Pecora found many malpractices on Wall Street and his investigation led to the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We can put these events at point B of the GDP chart</p>
<p>C. Hoover&#8217;s tax decrease in 1929/30 was followed by four years of decreasing GDP. His &#8220;misstep&#8221; tax increase was enacted in 1932 and took effect only in 1933, point C in our graph. From there on GDP went up.</p>
<p>D. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_deal">New Deal</a> beginnings.</p>
<p>Shlaes, according to her Wikipedia entry &#8220;has no formal economic training.&#8221; That certainly shows. She also seems to have zero training in history as she is unable to organize the sequence of events in a coherent way. Events and policies that obviously led to increases in GDP are attributed as having deepened the depression.</p>

                                <p>by stormy</p>
<p>Nouriel Roubini, in a post entitled <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/roubini-monitor/253323/the_decline_of_the_american_empire">Decline of the American Empire</a>, outlines four developments, marking the beginning of the end of the American Empire. The unique position of the U.S. as the sole &#8220;unipolar&#8221; power, he asserts, has been lost; America may now be in irretrievable decline.</p>
<p>Before I review Nouriel&#8217;s observations, let me two of my own. First, though America may yet pull its bacon out of the fire, any post mortem of its decline will, in all likelihood, lay the causes at the feet of U.S. policy, economic and military. </p>
<p>Second, America has&#8211;through its multinationals and managerial talent, its economic power, its science and universities&#8211;seeded the world, made possible the success of its rivals. As one of the prime architects and movers of globalization, America has inadvertently laid the foundation for the torch to be passed. Nouriel makes a good case for American decline. Consider:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>First, the US squandered its power by relying excessively on its hard military power in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan and in its unilateralist foreign policy – including economic issues such as global warming &#8211; rather than relying more on its soft power of diplomacy and multilateralist approaches to global policy issues.
</p>
<p>Second, regardless of mistaken US policies the rise of other economic and financial powers&#8230;that the relative economic, financial and geopolitical power of the US will be reduced over time
</p>
<p>Third, and more important, the US squandered its economic and financial power by running reckless economic policies, especially its twin fiscal and current account deficits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fourth, Nouriel notes that:</p>
<blockquote><p>the economic powers financing the US twin deficits are the strategic rivals of the US – China and Russia – and unstable petro-states, i.e., Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States and other shaky petro-states. This system of vendor financing – with these US creditors providing both the goods being imported and the financing of such deficits – has led to a balance of financial terror: if these creditors were to pull the plug on the financing of the US twin deficits the dollar would collapse and US interest rates would go through the roof. </p></blockquote>
<p>As the U.S. goes deeper and deeper in debt, it is transferring enormous wealth its rivals. I would include the &#8220;unstable petro-states&#8221; as rivals as well. There is certainly significant tension between Islamic states and America. Though some may seem to be friendly, even the friendly ones have harbored and ecouraged elements that are anything but friendly to the U.S. It is hard to forget, for example, the madrassas in Saudi Arabia that spawned many of the Taliban and the 911 bombers.</p>
<p>Furthermore,<br />
<blockquote>&#8230; foreign creditors of the US are getting tired of financing the US in the form of low-yielding US Treasuries. Thus the switch of such reserve holdings to SWFs that are planning to make large equity investments possibly with actual control of corporate firms and financial institutions that are desperate for capital to recapitalize themselves</p></blockquote>
<p>As many have noted, there is a price the U.S. must pay for its growing debt: Its assets. Sovereign Wealth Funds in the Middle East, China, and elsewhere will invest heavily in or outright buy American corporations financial institutions. They have the cash. While America may get desperately needed tax dollars in such purchases or investments, those purchases will not significantly lower our debt. We will lose the assets and keep the debt&#8211;a real spiraling down. The twin deficits will remain. Furthermore, those companies&#8211;and all their assets and know-how&#8211;may now serve new masters, masters whose goals we may well not share.</p>
<p>Nouriel notes that although it is unlikely that any of our creditors will suddenly &#8220;pull&#8221; the financial rug from beneath our feet; nonetheless, America is<br />
<blockquote>vulnerable to such rivals using the financial terror weapon – dumping US assets and or reducing their financing of the US twin deficits – in situations of geostrategic tension.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Suppose Russia flexes further its muscle in its backyard – under the pretense of defending abused Russian minorities in Ukraine, the Baltics and other former Soviet Union or Iron Curtain countries. Then Russia could use its financial power – the ability to dump hundreds of billions of dollar assets – to exert both financial and military influence. So could China over time if trouble in Taiwan or other disputed Asian territories become big geopolitical issues. Russia and China are already winning the new war for the control of commodities and ressources through their investments in Africa and Latin America &#8211; in the case of China – and its domestic and foreign control of energy and pipelines in Central Asia in the case of Russia. China and Russia are indeed winning the new Scramble for Resources.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nouriel expects the dollar as the main reserve currency to be challenged.<br />
<blockquote>Already Russia is flexing its muscle and pushing for an international role of the ruble; the euro is rising as a major reserve currency; central banks and SWFs will slowly but surely start to diversify away from dollar assets especially as the Bretton Woods 2 regime starts to unravel&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>If Nouriel is correct, how did all of this come to pass?</p>
<p>Certainly, the Iraq War has been a disaster in terms of cost, goodwill, lives, and attention. By &#8220;attention&#8221; I mean America&#8217;s obsession with it. That American raw power cannot tame two third-world states in less time than it took the allies to defeat the axis powers in WWII says it all. Perhaps it did not have &#8220;will&#8221; to do so. Whatever the causes, it has failed miserably. Caesar would have been stunned.</p>
<p>As I said, Iraq has been America&#8217;s obsession; meanwhile it pursued policies concerning energy, regulation, consumerism and trade that have proven disastrous. Its lack of its decades long coherent energy policy is obvious. That it espoused a freewheeling marketplace with minimum oversight is also obvious.</p>
<p>The centerpieces of its failure lie, I think, in its relentless consumerism, encourage by incessant and ubiquitous advertising, easy credit, and its disastrous trade policy. Bush stuck the tone of the decade when he urged America to shop after 911. A good trip to the mall will cure anything, including, I guess, fear of Saddam sending over nukes or the twin towers falling.</p>
<p>As one of the most significant forces in the last decade, globalization must be playing a role in America&#8217;s decline. America was one of its prime movers&#8211;and America&#8217;s fate must be tied inexorably to is development.</p>
<p>Certainly, America would not knowingly create the engine of its own decline. Certainly, its economists would have warned it. Many economists were quite happy with America&#8217;s future in a global marketplace. Are they surprised at the latest turn of events? Staggering twin deficits, a burgeoning trade deficit, loss of manufacturing&#8230;.</p>
<p>Was it mismanaged or was it happenstance that America&#8217;s decline coincided with its rise?<br />For a moment, let us grant that Nouriel is correct that America is in decline and continue with the post mortem, speaking as if we were future historians that saw a connection between globalization and America&#8217;s decline.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Americans were encouraged to be consumers, even as its trade deficit increased, even as its companies, one after another set up shop in countries with cheap and unprotected labor, low taxation, and weak environmental regulations. Walmart, which used to brag about &#8220;Made in America,&#8221; was the iconic symbol of what happened.</p>
<p>American manufacturing slowly wilted; its trade deficit increased. It outsourced goods and services in order to feed the consumerism encouraged at home. American corporations and financial institutions were all too happy to usher China into the WTO, along with other ripe export platforms. Bucks were to be made; goods were to be sold. The American consumer would keep the party going.</p>
<p>Globalization from the start was disjointed. One country, America, became the consumer of last resort. Emerging economies became producers of first resort. Emerging economies were not &#8220;emerging markets&#8221;; they were export platforms. America sent its production skills to these countries.</p>
<p>(Now, China may well become a future marketplace, but companies initially did not go there with that in mind.) How China played the game of globalization was intelligent and direct. Feeding off the American consumer and the foreign corporations it attracted, keeping its currency pegged for as long as possible, and keeping its labor force as unprotected and as cheap as possible for as long as possible, China gathered the cash to build its infrastructure and buy the resources for the long century ahead.</p>
<p>Foreign corporations in China liked the pegged yuan. Mismatched currencies added even more profits. Indeed, for a while the stock market soared, even as American wages stagnated. Similarly, foreign companies in China enjoyed unprotected and cheap labor. Similarly, those companies enjoyed the weak environmental regulations. Even if those companies claimed that they or their Chinese associates did not pollute, they did profit from the cheaper energy, a direct result of weak or non-existent environmental regulations.</p>
<p>Nouriel ends with one observation with which I do not agree:<br />
<blockquote>the brief period of unipolar power of the American hyperpower is now over and a new age of balance of great powers is starting in the world. Also, the rise of non governmental actors – multinational corporations, NGOs, terrorist groups, non-nation state powers, failed and unstable states, non-traditional global players – will radically change the traditional balance of power as the <i>power of nation states will shrink relative to that of other global players.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>[Italics mine.]</p>
<p>China will not shrink; neither will Russia; neither will, for example, Brazil. Terrorist groups may set up shop in places like Afghanistan, but unless they get nukes (Pakistan), they will not be much of a threat. No, countries are still the fruit de jour. It was always a mercantilist pipedream that it could be otherwise. Wealth and power has shifted back to command economies: Russia, China, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>These countries do and will continue to own the important corporations, corporations that control resources and important means of production: Aluminum Corporation of China and China Offshore Oil Corporation, for example. China may relax its grip on companies that deal in consumer goods, such as Lenovo (old IBM) or other companies such as Haier. They insist that corporations serve China&#8217;s purposes. Whether China will encourage rampant American-style consumerism remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In short, on every front, American craftily engineered its own downfall&#8230;from foolish wars to economic policy. All for what? (Certainly not any interest in America.) Greed is the word that comes to mind. Privatization was to be the dream, private ownership of resources and production. Yet, now we see the rise of powerful Soverign Wealth Funds ready to buy or invest in American corporations and financial institutions. What America has created will be on the auction block. For sale will be its managerial expertise, its production and investment facilities, its R&#038;D&#8230;anything movable and much that is not movable.</p>
<p>If Nouriel is correct, those creations will move to new owners, owners that do not share America&#8217;s vision of the individual or its sense of democracy. In that sense, America has seeded the world. What flowers may bloom, we do not know.</p>
