<p>The Obama administration has published draft rules for the formation and operation of Affordable Insurance Exchanges, a key element in the PPACA (Obamacare) plan to increase insurance coverage.</p>
<p>There is a 75 day comment and then more time to digest the comments before final rules are issued. Implementation is due by January 1, 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Business journalist Merrill Goozner has a terrific in-depth deconstruction of the so-called Texas Miracle at <em>TheFiscalTimes</em>, at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2011/07/08/Perrys-Texas-Miracle-Less-Than-Meets-the-Eye.aspx?p=1">Perry&#8217;s Texas Miracle less than meets the eye</a>, published last Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Texas, the jobs engine?  Or Texas, the jobs-laundering engine?</strong> </p>
<p>An op-ed piece mentioned by a reader two weekends ago in the <em>LA Times</em>, called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-wartzman-texas-20110703,0,964808.story">Texas, the jobs engine?</a> by Rick Wartzman, executive director of the Drucker Institute at Claremont Graduate University, begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve been unable to get a startling statistic out of my head: Since the recession officially ended, Texas has created more than 4 of every 10 new jobs in America.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, Texas: the reddest of red states, home to gun lovers and school textbooks that openly question whether the Founding Fathers intended for the separation of church and state. I am no ideologue. Still, whenever I get political, I tend to tilt reflexively to the left, making the jobs figure a bit disconcerting at first.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But there&#8217;s no escaping it. The number is real. Which means that if you care about putting people back to work at a time when nearly 14 million in this country are unemployed, maybe Texas has something to teach us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wartzman goes on to say that according to the Dallas Fed, Texas, which he says accounts for about 8% of the nation’s economy, generated 43% of the net new jobs in the U.S. from June 2009 through May 2011. He then notes that aspects of Texas’s boom cannot be optionally replicated in other states.  The booming energy industry and the high export demand for commodities such as beef and cotton.  </p>
<p>He then cites some longstanding government policies—both conservative and liberal ones. Conservative: Low tax rates, the downside of which, he notes, is a smaller safety net, and “right-to-work” laws, resulting in Texas’s tying Mississippi as the states with the  biggest percentage of workers paid at or below the minimum wage.  Liberal: Strict lending guidelines enacted in the wake of the S&#038;L crisis of the 1980s that require Texas financial institutions “to keep larger capital reserves and take on fewer problem mortgages than were seen elsewhere in the country,” and which spared the state from the real estate boom and bust that hit most of the rest of the country.  And beginning 25 years ago, the state began significantly increasing its education funding and therefore the quality of its workforce.  </p>
<p>Then the pay-off paragraph, so to speak:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the same time — and this, of course, is the tough part for those on the left to swallow — it is clear that the state&#8217;s limits on taxes, regulations and lawsuits are contributing to the job machine. &#8220;The most important thing I think that&#8217;s happened to us is tort reform,&#8221; Fisher, the Dallas Fed president, has said. He added that when John Deere and other companies have decided to hire in Texas, they&#8217;ve been largely driven by steps the state has taken to cap non-economic damages in medical malpractice suits and to make it harder to bring product liability and class-action cases.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay.  Are these folks claiming that the companies that are hiring in Texas decided to hire because of Texas’s low tax rates and its “tort reform” law?  Or are they saying that these companies needed to hire more workers, and chose to expand in Texas rather than in, say, California or Michigan or Ohio, because of Texas’s low taxes and tort reform?</p>
<p>Setting aside for a moment the fact that Texas’s tort laws have little effect on lawsuits for injuries from their products in other states—injured plaintiffs can sue in the state where they purchased and used the product and were injured by it, and it’s that state’s tort laws that apply—and that physicians apparently aren’t flooding the Texas landscape by moving there from other states, what these people actually are saying is that Texas , as the lowest-common-denominator state for pro-business laws, is attracting businesses from other states and is spurring hiring there that otherwise would occur in another state.  </p>
<p>Fine.  But if the issue regarding job losses and job growth is an aggregate one for the country as a whole, rather than which states lost the most jobs to lower-common-denominator states, then why praise Texas as a national jobs creator?  It’s not, at least not as a result of its government policies.  The claim to the contrary is like saying that South Dakota and North Carolina “created” all those credit-card-company jobs in recent decades, as if those jobs wouldn’t have been created, albeit disbursed more throughout the country, if those two states hadn’t enacted such credit-card-company-friendly laws.  </p>
<p>So when Rick Perry rolls out his presidential primary campaign and starts lauding all those Texas job gains, remember to ask what states those jobs otherwise would be in were it not for Texas’s chamber-of-commerce legislature’s largesse of recent years. I’m sure y’all will.</p>

<div>Ok some more information to bolster my position that my flower shop being down this year another 4.5% compared to last year (at least the decline is leveling off) is not the results of government debt or too much taxation or banks not lending or unions&#8230; nope, my shop is off because of one thing: Lack of income in the hands of the many and nothing to date has been done to change that.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As noted <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/monetary-policy-im-sorry-its-just-not.html">here</a> and<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/monetary-policy-im-not-only-not-feeling.html"> here</a>, monetary policy is not going to cut it.  (Please pray for the Greeks.)   </div>
<div>Or I should say, not cutting it for anyone who earns a penny because someone else had an extra penny to spend beyond their non-discretionary expenditures.  That is, they are at the point of autonomous consumption, but not at the point of offsetting income earned from their cognitive or physical labor with that earned from money.  That means we&#8217;re talking about the bottom 90% of the income earning population.  (The top 10% own 82% of the stock.)</div>

<p>
<div>The first shows just how much of a dive spending has taken.  Considering we&#8217;re a &#8220;consumption economy&#8221;, I don&#8217;t think this bodes well for us.  The second shows how lacking in recovery such spending is compared to prior recession.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I don&#8217;t care how much money we pump into the economy at the top, if it doesn&#8217;t get in the hands the bottom 90% of the income earners, there will be no recovery.  It does not matter if the Fed&#8217;s are pumping it in or the Government is doing it via tax reductions because both methods are not putting the majority of the money in the hands of the many.  The Fed article notes that this discretionary spending is &#8220;services&#8221;.  It is 30% of all personal consumption expenditures (PCE).  Non-discretionary is 34% of PCE, that leaves 36% somewhere in the middle?  They state PCE is 70% of all output.  So, 30% of 70% is 21% of all output?  Using $14.7trillion means about 3.09 trillion has taken a 7% hit of $216 billion! ( I readily accept any math corrections in comments)</div>
<div></div>
<div>The author states:  </div>
<blockquote><div>Because consumption accounts for about 70 percent of output, this in turn raises some concern about the future strength of the recovery.</div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><div>That&#8217;s an understatement!  He hedges some more: Also, households may remain wary about their employment and income prospects, suggesting that they may have lowered their future income expectations.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Really?  &#8220;May&#8221; is the word one wants to use here? </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>A <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-collapse-in-us-discretionary-spending-2011-7">Mr. Roche</a> is more direct:</div>
<div></div>
<div>The real weakness in this recovery is rooted in the fact that consumer balance sheets are so mangled that they’re spending primarily on non-discretionary items and saving the rest of their incomes to pay down debts.  This is important to understand because policy must be geared in such a way that it does not further hinder the household balance sheet.  And therein lies the problem with a policy such as QE2.  Anything that can potentially cause cost push inflation will only further weaken the household sector and detract from any possible recovery.  In the case of QE2 I think we saw the increased speculation contribute directly to rising commodity prices which ultimately squeezed consumers further and led to the current soft spot in the economy.</div>
<div>BINGO!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s not stop there.  From Mr. Weisenthal Under &#8220;<a href="http://real-economics.blogspot.com/2011/07/bankruptcy-of-economics.html">Scariest Job&#8217;s Chart Ever</a>&#8221; we get this one on the duration of unemployment.</div>

<div>Which brings me to my posting from 4/2008:<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/04/longest-recession-ever.html"> The longest Recession Ever</a></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I noted in this post that it took 20 months from the Bush 2 recession for the peak of what I call Person Weeks Unemployed (a multiple of the number of people out and the number of weeks out).  I also noted that Reagan with back to back recessions did not see the peak until 30 months past the first recession.  Almost 3 full years!  He also double the quotient.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>I ended with: </div>
<blockquote><div>Thus, the peak of a recession is in the eye of the beholder. If you&#8217;re a person earning money from labor, a recession these days can last a very long time. This data would suggest that what we are seeing in the Spencer post is not a decreased risk but a lull before the storm. One other thing. It appears the Republicans fail again. As a group they have the longest turn-around to seeing a reduction in lost labor.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>There you have it.  You want to fix the economy?  Don&#8217;t follow the conservative ideology.   The Republicans win in delaying recoveries.  Yet, here we are with a &#8220;Democratic&#8221; president using the very language, words, framing of the group that is proven to not know how to create jobs and thus get money in the hands of the many in the shortest amount of time.  Some say the Republicans are doing it this time with intention.  I doubt that, though it is a meme that would make them seem to be the ultimate chess players.  </div>

                                <p>Over at Economist&#8217; View he has posted a nice set of charts on the GDP Gap, employment versus the long term trend and other measures of how much excess capacity the economy has that have become very popular among economists over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/</p>
<p>But these charts never include profits in their analysis and I would suggest that readers should know how profits look versus their long term trend.</p>
<p>Over the last 50 years the long run growth rate of S&#038;P 500 earnings per share has been about 7%.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if you look at the more recent trend of operation earnings the trend growth rate has been almost this high.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>S&#038;P 500 EPS is almost back to its 7% long run trend and the consensus bottom-up earnings forecast has it surpassing the long run trend in either the 4th quarter or the 1st quarter.  By way of contrast it will be years before the GDP Gap is closed or the economy reaches full employment.<br />This really shows how virtually all the gains in income so far in the recovery has gone to profits<br />rather than labor.</p>

<p><strong>A Post:  Tax Burdens, Presidents, and Subsequent Economic Growth &#8211; A Few Pictures, Part 1</strong></p>
<p>Last week I had a post looking at the relationship between <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/presidents-tax-burdens-and-subsequent.html">the change in the tax burden in the first two years of a Presidential administration and the growth of real GDP during the remaining years of the administration</a>.  I&#8217;ve done variations of this exercise before.  It turns out that the more an administration reduced the tax burden in its first two years, the slower the growth the in real GDP over the remainder of its term in office administration.  Assuming the result is more than an artifact of the data (and it does seem to correspond with other results I&#8217;ve reported here over the years), it requires an explanation.  While (I am not happy to report) an increased tax burden <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/simple-explanation-for-strange-paradox.html">might in and of itself stimulate faster economic growth</a>, I suspect a bigger effect is that a) the easiest way to move the tax burden is by increasing or decreasing tax regulation and b) there is a correlation between an administration&#8217;s views on tax regulations and its views on other regulations that are intended to prevent externalities.   This theory is supported by the fact that the relationship between lower tax burdens and slower growth is strengthened by not including the administrations that served only four rather than eight years makes the relationship stronger.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As I keep noting, one doesn&#8217;t have to like the results.  I personally would much prefer a world in which lower tax burdens do lead to faster economic growth.  But the data doesn&#8217;t seem to show that.  Still, every time I put up a post like this, I get a lot of flack.  One thing people keep telling me is that the results are, at best, a coincidence.  In their honor, in today&#8217;s post I&#8217;m going to describe a few more coincidences that the data shows in my next few posts.  Some of these coincidences I expected to see, and some, to be frank, I did not.  Today I&#8217;m going to stick with a few coincidences I expected.</p>
<p>So&#8230;  let&#8217;s go with coincidence number one. The graph below shows the change in the tax burden from Year 0 (i.e., the last full year of the prior administration) to Year 2 on one axis, and the growth rate in the last full year of each administration.  (Only eight year administrations are included.)  As an example, for Ronald Reagan, we see the change in the tax burden from 1980 to 1982 along one axis and the percentage change from the 1987 real GDP to the 1988 real GDP.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7RNRhtKqqLc/ThrMTwrhaBI/AAAAAAAAAqU/fqqQYQet0G4/s1600/Follow-up_figure_1.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7RNRhtKqqLc/ThrMTwrhaBI/AAAAAAAAAqU/fqqQYQet0G4/s320/Follow-up_figure_1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 1</p>
<p>Notice that the relationship between the tax burden in the first two years of each administration and the growth rate in its last year is extremely strong.  That&#8217;s consistent with what I wrote in my last post (and so many times before):  most administrations do not change their tax policy very much, but tax policy (and other policies that correlate with tax policy) can take a while to have an effect on the economy. </p>
<p>Before I go on, a few ground rules for those who want to comment or send me e-mail: <br />1.  If you really believe that the growth rate in the last year of an administration is &#8220;causing&#8221; the change in the tax burden in the beginning of the administration, I encourage you to seek psychiatric help.  I can&#8217;t do anything for you.<br />2.  US&#8217; participation in World War 2 prior to 1940 is best described as peripheral.  Growth in 1940, or 1939, or 1934 for that matter, is not due to World War 2.  </p>
<p>(If you find my constant repetition of these ground rules funny, hazard a guess as to what creeps into my inbox.)  </p>
<p>Now, another coincidence&#8230;  the next figure shows the the change in the tax burden from Year 0 (i.e., the last full year of the prior administration) to Year 2 on one axis, and the growth rate in the fourth year of each administration. </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xfHijDM1urw/ThrMTwNv-zI/AAAAAAAAAqc/CKJJTyPT0Js/s1600/Follow-up_figure_2_-_corrected.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xfHijDM1urw/ThrMTwNv-zI/AAAAAAAAAqc/CKJJTyPT0Js/s320/Follow-up_figure_2_-_corrected.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2</p>
<p>Again&#8230; the picture looks an awful like Figure 1.  The fit isn&#8217;t as good (consistent with the idea that it takes a while for policy to have a a very strong effect.  Kind of odd for a coincidence.</p>
<p>Now&#8230; you may be wondering&#8230; what about other years.  I&#8217;ll tell you flat out, the fits in years 1 and 2 are awful&#8230; consistent with the idea that it takes a while for policy to have a very strong effect.  As to the rest, that will wait for the next post.</p>
<p>To close, nominal and real GDP come from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>.  GDP was first computed in 1929, so the first complete administration for which we have data is FDR I.  Data on the Federal government&#8217;s tax receipts comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N#S3">NIPA Table 3.2</a>.</p>

                                <p>Jobs growth is a lagging indicator of economic activity, so the June report confirms that the US economy has been in a deep rut (Marshall Auerback calls it a <a href="http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2011/07/time-to-panic-ii.html">&#8216;fully-fledged New York City style pot hole&#8217;</a>). Yes, the US economy is growing; but sub-2% really &#8216;feels&#8217; like stagnation, if not recession for many. As always, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/july-employment-situation.html">Spencer provides </a> a fantastic summary of the employment report here on AB: &#8216;bad news&#8217;, he says.</p>
<p>I call it abysmal, both relative to history and on a cross section. The chart below illustrates the unemployment rates across the G7 spanning 1995 to 2011.</p>

France&#8217;s high level of unemployment is structural. In contrast, the US level of unemployment is NOT, not even close.</p>

Also, see a <a href="http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2001/swe0105c.pdf">short note by the Dallas Fed</a> highlighting the differences between the French and US labor markets (and the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/51/1941679.pdf">1994 OECD jobs study</a>).</p>
<p>The French labor market is quite rigid, which leads to a structurally elevated unemployment rate and expansive unemployment compensation (see <a href="http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2001/swe0105c.pdf">this follow up </a>to the OECD 1994 jobs strategy report). The US Labor markets is much more fluid, which is why the unemployment rate has surged relative to comparable economies in Europe (see second chart).</p>

In normal times, French workers can collect benefits for up to 23 months by law, where the US worker collects for just 6 months. The tax and benefit policies data are updated infrequently, and listed on the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/3/0,3746,en_2649_34637_39617987_1_1_1_1,00.html#statistics">OECD&#8217;s website</a> (<a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/38/16/44508994.xls">excel file link</a>).</p>
<p>Seriously, shouldn&#8217;t Congress be focused on the depressed state of the US labor market, rather than a &#8216;scaled back&#8217; version of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/us/politics/10debt.html?hp">deficit cutting</a>? Addressing one will clearly impact the other &#8211; it goes both ways. Unfortunately, the government&#8217;s pushing in the wrong direction (cutting deficits brings further unemployment rather reducing unemployment drops the deficits).</p>

Actually, with oil prices falling real weekly earnings  ticked up month before last, the only gain in seven months.  But this month average weekly earnings actually fell from $652.51 to $652.18 so unless we are experiencing deflation real wages will fall again this month.  Given this weakness in wages and earnings it is extremely difficult to see where growth is going to come from.</p>

                                <p>Op ed by <strong>Nancy Ortiz</strong></p>
<p>Scott Hochberg&#8217;s article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/making-e-verify-mandatory-perfect-storm.html">Making E-Verify Mandatory: The Perfect Storm for Crippling the Social Security Administration and Jeopardizing the Social Safety Net</a> discusses issues regarding the e-Verify system and a move in Congress to make it mandatory for everyone hired for a job in the US. He points out that eVerify is every bit as much a threat to SS and Medicare as any of the other benefit, COLA, or Medicare provider cuts now being discussed. I read Hochberg&#8217;s article with great interest and have a few additional points to add to his excellent analysis of this subject.  </p>
<p>When the Immigration Reform Act took effect in 1987, I was the manager of the SS office in Northern Santa Barbara County in strawberry, broccoli, lettuce and wine grape country. Thousands of migrant workers pass through the area at the height of the picking season between January and May. Many stay with or without authorization so that about 60% of the population is Hispanic and/or non-English speaking/non-US national. You will find similar demographics up and down the California Central Coast in agricultural areas, so there&#8217;s nothing unusual about this.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll spare you the war stories of actually implementing IRCA&#8217;s social security number provisions. This was the Bush I administration notable for its parsimony in budgeting for SSA operations. (How bad was it? How about no hiring, no overtime and no photocopy paper bad?) Farm workers in the area lined up with their new Immigration work visas in hand outside our office door at 6:00A and we interviewed Social Security Number applicants until 5:00P every day from 1987 til mid-1989. It was hard to get anything else done, but the normal operation got busier because of the recession that put maybe 15% of the workforce in our area out of work.</p>
<p>Alright, now it won&#8217;t take much imagination to imagine the same situation but worse, because now every worker  would be subject to e-verify. Not just the &#8220;obvious illegals,&#8221; every single one who applied for a job. Hochberg&#8217;s article summarizes the projected workload from this but SSA&#8217;s workforce is now 20 or more years older <br />and really, really ready to retire. And, of course, Congress is talking about cutting the whole federal civil service workforce 10% across the board while maintaining an indefinite hiring freeze and whacking every agencies&#8217; budget in its 2 Trillion to 4 Trillion dollar spending cuts. The President is ready to agree to at least 2 Trillion in cuts, but discussions are continuing.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can see now why making it illegal to work in the US without lawful admission was a bad, terrible, awful, rotten, really bad idea from the git-go. &#8220;All we would have to do to&#8221; avoid this debacle is revoke this provision and we could go back to doing business the way we did before 1987. The punitive notion of making<br />work without documents a &#8220;crime&#8221; has resulted in a flood of counterfeit and stolen documents. Field workers often buy many sets of documents (at high prices) before getting a set that will pass employers&#8217; inspection. Every town in California and other border states has document mills.  Sanctions against employers for hiring undocumented workers are virtually never imposed. Identity theft, impossible to prevent and prosecute effectively, is epidemic. And, on and on. All because of the notion that working in the US should be a crime.</p>
<p>If you remain unconvinced, let me remind you that the budget for SSA&#8217;s New New Computer Center was reduced about in this last round of spending cuts. This will make it impossible to meet an early construction deadline made necessary by the fragility of the existing computer system. This is estimated to result in causing SSA&#8217;s now aged and outdated computer processing and data storage systems to collapse<br />sometime between now and 2013. 2013 is supposedly the outside range of functionality assuming nothing catastrophic (such as a major power grid black out) happens between now and then. Otherwise, it can go at any time. Finally, I don&#8217;t need to remind you of the pending DIB appeals workload of approx. 700K cases still on hand.</p>
<p>But, in closing let me ask you&#8211;can you prove you are a US citizen or lawfully admitted alien with permission to work if I ask you right this minute? No, your drivers&#8217; license isn&#8217;t enough. Your SS card isn&#8217;t ID.  You may have a US Passport but it won&#8217;t resolve the matter unless it is current. Your current or former employer&#8217;s assurance isn&#8217;t enough either.</p>
<p>Prove to me who you are or you can&#8217;t work here any more. And, it says here on this little No Match notice that you aren&#8217;t who you say you are. So, what about it? Exactly who are you anyway, Mr. Working American?</p>
