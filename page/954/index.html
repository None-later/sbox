                                <p>When <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/just-say-no.html">CalculatedRisk</a> criticized the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082700557.html">Kerrey-Rudman</a> proposal for long-term fiscal sanity, I may have been too quick to suggest we find someone way to say “yes”.  CR was quite clear:<br />
<blockquote>Everyone should agree that the most immediate fiscal problem is the structural General Fund deficit. Excluding future health care costs, the structural deficit is around 4% to 4.5% of GDP. This serious problem has been caused almost exclusively by Bush&#8217;s policies. And imagine if the economy slows next year, as many people expect, adding a cyclical deficit on top of the huge Bush structural deficit. So isn&#8217;t it reasonable to suggest that Mr. Bush and the GOP fix the structural deficit first, before addressing other long-term issues? Of course.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2006/08/first-things-first.html">Andrew Samwick</a> agrees:<br />
<blockquote>the appropriate target for the General Fund deficit is for it to average to zero over a business cycle. A corollary to that is that the General Fund should be in surplus during the non-recessionary parts of that business cycle. (A slightly weaker target that I would also accept is that the Debt/GDP ratio not trend upward over time.) This Administration seems to have no problem submitting budgets that don&#8217;t conform to this target. Certainly the Congress doesn&#8217;t aspire to a higher standard. So as much as I would like to see the looming financial crises with entitlement programs averted, CR&#8217;s requirement of the current leadership in the White House and the Capitol is a reasonable one to impose as a precondition for agreeing to a bipartisan effort to address what will be the most immediate budget issues in a decade or two.</p></blockquote>
<p>And thanks to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/08/yet_more_whining_about_entitle.html#006019">Dean Baker</a> for pointing out the Trojan Horse embedded in the Kerrey-Rudman proposal: <br />
<blockquote>In addition to conflating Social Security and Medicare as “entitlements” that will pose problems, the column also has a few other standard scare tactics.</p></blockquote>
<p>One explanation for President Bush’s fiscal insanity is that he really wishes to impose what I have dubbed backdoor employment tax increases by slashing Social Security benefits by more than any reductions in payroll “contributions”.  Dr. Samwick and I have what I think is a basic agreement on the Social Security Trust Fund debate – that we should address its long-term solvency problems but that we should not use the current surpluses to bail out the General Fund mess.  If that is the Bush plan, shame of Kerry and Rudman for playing along with it.  And shame on me for not getting this right away.  My thanks to my fellow Angrybears and especially to the always delightful Dean Baker who unloaded this critique of the Washington Post:<br />
<blockquote>The fact that the Post prints this stuff would not be so bad if they would occasionally allow an opposing view. They don’t. The Taliban Times will run a picture of the prophet Muhammad in a compromising position before the Post ever runs a column explaining that there is no “entitlement crisis,” just a broken U.S. health care system.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Former Senators Bob Kerrey and Warren Rudman are urging the formation of a new bipartisan commission to address long-term fiscal reform in the United States.  Writing in the Washington Post, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Securing Future Fiscal Health</a>, the Senators suggest:<br />
<blockquote>Republicans cannot take tax increases off the table, and Democrats cannot take benefit reductions off the table.</p></blockquote>
<p> And the Senators conclude by asking: &#8220;Any takers?&#8221;</p>
<p>The simple answer is No.</p>
<p>Everyone should agree that the most immediate fiscal problem is the structural General Fund deficit.  Excluding future health care costs, the structural deficit is around 4% to 4.5% of GDP.  This serious problem has been caused almost exclusively by Bush&#8217;s policies.  And imagine if the economy slows next year, as many people expect, adding a cyclical deficit on top of the huge Bush structural deficit.</p>
<p>So isn&#8217;t it reasonable to suggest that Mr. Bush and the GOP fix the structural deficit <i>first</i>, before addressing other long-term issues?  Of course.  </p>
<p>And that means rolling back most of the Bush tax shifts, and / or Bush&#8217;s spending on defense and Medicare Part D, and then we can have a commission.  Did I mention that year-to-date, the increase in the National Debt has set a new record?  (As of Aug 24th, the National Debt has increased $574.4 Billion for fiscal 2006; the fiscal year ends Sept 30th).</p>
<p>So when the Senators ask if there are any takers, just say no.</p>

<blockquote>Let’s start with the Fed’s goofy sacrifice ratio, which basically refers to how much unemployment has to go up in order to bring inflation down. I call this economic garbage the &#8220;Phillips curve in drag,&#8221; because over the last 25 years, unemployment and inflation have actually moved in tandem and they have both moved down. In other words, as inflation slows, unemployment comes down because the economy is strong. (If you look at their relationship during the 1970s, you would see unemployment and inflation both moving higher.) The fact is, strong growth coexists rather nicely with low inflation. And since inflation is too much money chasing too few goods, then if you&#8217;re producing more goods that absorb the money supply, especially with low tax rates to produce more goods, then why should we fear growth?</p></blockquote>
<p>One would think Kudlow would have been avoided stepping into this debate given how <a href="http://knzn.blogspot.com/2006/08/dangerous-curve.html">KNZN</a> ripped apart Art Laffer:<br />
<blockquote>It appears that, all these years that I’ve been studying the Phillips curve, I’ve been under a wrong impression about what the Phillips curve was. You see, naïve as I was, I thought that demand was the causal factor. I thought that excess demand caused both faster growth and rising inflation rates. I had this crazy idea that maybe, faced with excess demand, firms would both raise prices and increase production, thus increasing the inflation rate and increasing the growth of output at the same time. And I also thought that this excess demand would give firms a reason to hire more workers, even if they had to pay higher wages to do so, so the unemployment rate would fall and wages would rise. Seems like a pretty reasonable theory to me; I doubt you would have to dig very far down in the duffle bag to find an economist who believes it. But apparently, this is not what the Phillips curve is about. No, according to Laffer, the Phillips curve is the idea that growth itself causes inflation. That is a really dumb theory. No wonder so few of us actually believe it. All this time I thought I believed in the Phillips curve, when actually what I believed was something quite different.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or as we noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/art-laffer-v-donald-luskin-on-phillips.html">here</a>: <br />
<blockquote>KNZN nails Laffer on not knowing the difference between SHIFTS OF a curve versus SHIFTS ALONG a curve.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow makes the same mistake.  The 1970’s were seen as outward shifts of the short-run Phillips curve (cost push theories, Friedman expectation theories, etc.) not movements along.  But let’s review the history of inflation since Clinton took office in our first graph.</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/a2-777421.JPG"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/a2-774191.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Oh – very little change in the unemployment rate with a lot of noise in the inflation rate.  OK, let’s consider the Reagan-Bush41 years.  Except the only real noise comes during the early disinflation period – and guess what?  Unemployment was high.  </p>

<p>OK, we could graph the Phillips curve for the entire period from 1981 and see little correlation.  But would one be surprised that during a period where the shifts of the curve likely dominated the movement along a short-term curve that we would see little correlation?  But if Kudlow sees a strong positive correlation – I have to ask: what is he smoking?</p>

<p>Update: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/08/kudlow_needs_he.html">Mark Thoma</a> responds to my email to provide a few comments regarding Kudlow’s latest confusion.  Mark does a very nice job of framing the debate over the Phillip’s curve.</p>
<p>Update II: <a href="http://knzn.blogspot.com/2006/08/phillips-curve.html">KNZN</a> writes:<br />
<blockquote>either Larry Kudlow is trying to pull the wool over people’s eyes, or he is somehow unaware of the last 40 years of Phillips curve research. His argument essentially goes like this: the Phillips curve is an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. What we observe, however, is that the relationship is positive, not inverse. Therefore the Phillips curve is wrong. That might be a strong argument against the version of the Phillips curve that was widely believed during the 1960s (the “groovey” Phillips curve, as Gabriel Mihalache called it in an earlier comment). That version posited a stable relationship between the unemployment rate and the level of inflation, the same relationship in the long run as in the short run. The problem is, nobody believes in that version of the Phillips curve any more. Don’t even bother looking in the duffle bag. That argument was settled conclusively before Bill Gates dropped out of college. For practical purposes, the Phillips curve – the version that is used to guide forecasts and generate policy prescriptions today – is not a relationship between unemployment and the level of inflation; it is a relationship between unemployment and the change in the inflation rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>The other vowelless economist blogger proceeds to graph the data and concludes:<br />
<blockquote>I don’t know about you, but that sure looks like an inverse relationship to me. Want to include the 1970s? OK.</p></blockquote>
<p>All I have to say is – GROOVY!</p>

<blockquote><p>Armitage acknowledged that he had passed along to Novak information contained in a classified State Department memo: that Wilson&#8217;s wife worked on weapons-of-mass-destruction issues at the CIA. (The memo made no reference to her undercover status.)</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/08/27/somethings-missing">Christy Hardin Smith </a> calmly notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Armitage may have told Novak and Woodward that Valerie was involved in some way in her husband’s selection as the CIA’s man-on-the-ground in Niger, but it appears, according to Isikoff at least, that he did not have knowledge at that point that she was a covert operative, which is an essential piece of the charging puzzle for Patrick Fitzgerald’s prosecution.</p></blockquote>
<p>She provides a lot more as well as links to other posts that are not tainted by the tendency of the rightwingers to provide any excuse possible for the behavior of Cheney and his loyal followers.  </p>
<p>But let’s focus on what Armitage did not know but Novak did when he penned his July 14, 2003 outing of Plame’s covert status.  Novak at first tried to claim he did not say Plame was an undercover agent – but of course his own column undermines this mendacity.  The National Review crowd tried to dismiss this tidbit as news as we all knew the Joe Wilson was married to Valerie Plame.  But the public did not know Joe’s wife worked for the CIA.  The National Review tried to argue that Plame was only a desk jockey at the CIA – which may have been consistent with what Armitage thought before July 14, 2003 – even though we all knew after the publication of Novak’s piece that the National Review crowd was lying when they made this bogus claim.  And now Tom Maguire argues that Armitage had to know that Plame was a covert agent.  As usual – Tom has made a charge without a shred of evidence.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Criticizing the latest offering from an economics writer for the National Review is usually PGL’s purview, but since he has chosen to ignore <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MDlmYmIwMDU4ZTg1YmJkNWY3MWUzZTQ3YmEzYTBjZjY="> Lawrence Kudlow’s latest entitled “SOVIET-STYLE CENTRAL PLANNING”</a> I figured I’d give it a whirl.  Kudlow starts  off with “[u]nfortunately, it’s beginning to look like two of Washington’s major institutions (The Fed &#038; the CBO) want to sabotage the American economy.”</p>
<p>The CBO’s contribution to this sabotage takes the following form:  “These folks are telling Congress that only higher taxes in the next ten years will balance the budget. Huh?”</p>
<p>See, “[t]his crowd actually believes that President Bush’s tax cuts will trigger a $1.7 trillion budget hole in the next decade. The reality is that in the last couple of years since they were implemented, there have been huge revenue gains rolling in to the Treasury from the strong economy.”  </p>
<p>Now, one might point out that the deficit is at a historic high, even in real dollar terms.  A sensible response, probably even Kudlow’s response, would be that this is the wrong way to view the deficit.  We should, after all look at the deficit as a percentage of GDP.  When viewed in that light, while the deficit is not pretty, its not yet as bad as it was in the Reagan era before Reagan reversed some of his tax cuts, and of course, not even close to the deficits during World War 2.  (Budget deficit figures – nominal, real, and as a percentage of GDP are available at the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z3.xls"> White House’s Office of Management and Budget”</a>)</p>
<p>Now, if we took the same sensible approach toward viewing tax collection, namely looking at tax as a percentage of GDP, the tax revenues that Kudlow is crowing about don’t look very good.  Tax receipts were equal to 17.5 percent of GDP.  In the 61 years between 1946 and 2005, tax receipts were greater than 17.5 percent 41 times, including for every single year of the Clinton administration.  (In fact, adjusted for inflation, taxes collected in the year 2000 were greater than taxes collected in the year 2005.)</p>
<p>Kudlow ends his post with the words:  “I don’t get it.”  Well, I agree with him about something.</p>

                                <p>China has been enjoying growth rates near 10% for several years as compared the U.S. growth rates over the past five years, which have averaged less than 3%.  Anyone who accepts the premise of the <a href="http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/growth/neoclass/solowconv.htm">convergence hypothesis</a> might not be surprised:<br />
<blockquote>The absolute convergence hypothesis, posits the following: consider a group of countries, all of which have access to the same technology &#8230; the same population growth rate (n) and the same savings propensity (s), and only differ in terms of their initial capital-labor ratio, k. Then, we should expect all countries to converge to the same steady-state capital-labor ratio, output per capita and consumption per capita (k*, y*, c*) and, of course, the same growth rate (n) &#8230; Notice that this means that the poor country will grow relatively fast (capital and output grow faster than n), while the rich nation will grow quite slowly (capital and output grow slower than n). </p></blockquote>
<p>Modern growth economists will argue that we have deepened our understanding of growth since Robert Solow proposed his seminal model almost 50 years ago.  I’ll go through a simple exercise of the Solow model in a moment – but let me thank <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/08/differences_in_.html">Mark Thoma</a> for pointing out something interesting from <a href="http://www.shanghaidaily.com/art/2006/08/25/290038/Growth_rate_gulf_result_of_opposite_approach_to_saving.htm">Robert Shiller</a>: <br />
<blockquote>The saving rate in China is the highest of any major country. China&#8217;s gross saving rate (the percentage of GDP that is not consumed immediately), which includes both public and private saving, is around 50 percent. By contrast, the saving rate in the United States is the lowest of any major country &#8211; roughly 10 percent of GDP. Differences in saving rates must be a major reason that China&#8217;s annual economic growth rate is a full six percentage points higher than in the US … the uptrend in saving in China began at around the same time as its family planning policy was implemented in 1979. This prevented the birth rate from rebounding after the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shiller also tries to explain the observed difference in savings rates, but he also predicts that the Chinese savings rate will eventually decline.</p>
<p>But suppose we calibrated a classroom exercise with two nations: A (America) and C (China).  We shall assume both have a savings rate = 9% and growth in effective labor (population growth plus technological growth) = 3%, which would imply a steady state capital-output ratio = 3.  Our model is calibrated such that A’s output = $12.6 trillion with a capital stock = $37.8 trillion such that its 300 million citizens supply 300 billion of labor hours (half of the population working 2000 hours per year).  The model also assumes a Cobb-Douglas production function with the capital share being 30%.  The model for A predicts current output per person = $42,000 per year and output growth also equals 3% per year.  Taking the same model for C, let assume population = 1305 million with labor hours supplied = 1.305 trillion but have a capital stock of only $380 billion – which would imply output = $8.87 trillion or $6800 per person with a capital-output ratio equal to 0.0428.  This model also has A’s wages being $29.40 per hour, while C’s wages would be $4.76 per hour. </p>
<p>Now if we consider the implications of this model for growth over the next decade, we would see A’s growth staying at 3% per year, while B’s growth would start 43% for the first year, still be as high 11.8% by year 5, and tampering to something over 7% by the end of the decade.  The capital-output ratio would have risen to 0.565 by the end of the decade with output per person exceeding $20,000 per year and wages exceeding $14 an hour.  </p>
<p>As Shiller notes, the reported savings rate for China is even higher and its population growth has been kept low.  The U.S., on the other hand, has suffered from a reduction in its national savings rate.  There may be a host of reasons why China’s economy failed to generate increases in output per person that were as high as the simple convergence hypothesis would have predicted.  Shiller is pointing out, however, that China is enjoying the benefits of a high savings rates, which could imply even faster convergence.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/08/stiglitz_privat.html">Mark Thoma</a>, we get to enjoy the thoughts of <a href="https://registration.ft.com/registration/barrier?referer=http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/08/stiglitz_privat.html&#038;location=http%3A//www.ft.com/cms/s/cc79a78c-313b-11db-b953-0000779e2340.html">Joseph Stiglitz</a> on privatization of airport security:<br />
<blockquote>Britain’s current airport debacle is the predictable and predicted outcome of ill-conceived airport privatisation. Some things – steel mills for example – can be easily privatised; others cannot, as America’s problems in contracting security arrangements made clear. The problems Britain has encountered in privatising its railroads show that, at the very least, extreme care must be taken in the privatisation of vital public services. During the Clinton administration, privatisation of the US air traffic control system was hotly debated, and while aspects of privatising air traffic control systems and airports are not identical, they are sufficiently similar that the analysis may be relevant here. The US Council of Economic Advisers, of which I was a member and then chairman, after careful analysis, expressed strong reservations partly because airports (and air traffic control systems) are almost inevitably virtual or actual monopolies. It is just too risky to privatise an entity that will not face competition. The UK airports crisis, triggered by the recent discovery of a terrorist plot to blow up aircraft, showed the mismatch between the interests of a private operator and those of users – both the airlines and, more importantly, their customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>After 9/11, the issue of whether we should Federalize our airport security system was again hotly debated. On October 16, 2001, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2001/10/17/air-safety.htm#more">Richard Benedetto</a> reported on the position of the Democrats and a few Republicans versus the position of the White House:<br />
<blockquote>Led by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, they say screening can remain in the hands of private firms as long as workers are supervised, tested and trained under federal authority. It&#8217;s a position backed by President Bush. Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, chairman of the House transportation panel, will introduce the Republicans&#8217; bill today … The Gephardt call was quickly dismissed as &#8220;politics&#8221; by House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.  He countered that Democrats want to &#8220;federalize&#8221; the screeners because it could add up to 28,000 more union workers to the federal payroll.  Union members tend to favor Democrats.  &#8220;We stand with the president in favor of the kind of public-private security system that has worked in Europe and Israel,&#8221; DeLay said. Under the foreign models, the government provides 10% to 15% of security personnel. The remaining 85% to 90% are private workers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The claim that the Israeli system was a private one was challenged at the time.  President Bush later sent Ari Fleischer to tell reporters that there were several studies that proved a privatized system worked better.  To my knowledge, he never identified a single one.  I’d hate to suggest Mr. Fleischer lied to us almost five years ago, but his assertion seems to be quite different that the view put forth by Dr. Stiglitz.  After five years, couldn’t the supporters of privatization produce at least one of these alleged studies?</p>

                                <p>I have been known to have a few minor disagreements with Max Sawicky on the value of generational accounting aka taking a long-term present value perspective of fiscal policy, but I have to say that the criticism from <a href="http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/2006/08/max-sawicky-is-wrong.html">Daniel Shaviro</a> is just stupid:<br />
<blockquote>With all due respect, which I do have for Max Sawicky, he is wrong, as in w-r-o-n-g. He thinks we shouldn&#8217;t do long-term fiscal projections. I hope he doesn&#8217;t live his life that way (e.g., is he planning to retire some day? Or send still-young kids to college?).</p></blockquote>
<p>But Max is not saying that.  What he is very sensibly saying is that present value calculations are very sensitive to the assumptions of the discount rate (as well as projected future cash flows).  If Shaviro doesn’t get this, maybe he should take Finance 101.  Max is also saying good economic policy goes beyond the long-term balance sheet.  But hey – Max speaks very ably for <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002455.html">himself</a>. <br />And I was going to give Art Laffer the stupidest man alive award.  Silly me.</p>

<blockquote>Arthur Laffer, on the opinion page of today’s Wall Street Journal, writes: “You&#8217;d have to dig pretty far down in the duffle bag of economists to find one who actually believes in the Philips Curve &#8211; the idea that rapid growth causes inflation.” It appears that, all these years that I’ve been studying the Phillips curve, I’ve been under a wrong impression about what the Phillips curve was. You see, naïve as I was, I thought that demand was the causal factor. I thought that excess demand caused both faster growth and rising inflation rates. I had this crazy idea that maybe, faced with excess demand, firms would both raise prices and increase production, thus increasing the inflation rate and increasing the growth of output at the same time. And I also thought that this excess demand would give firms a reason to hire more workers, even if they had to pay higher wages to do so, so the unemployment rate would fall and wages would rise. Seems like a pretty reasonable theory to me; I doubt you would have to dig very far down in the duffle bag to find an economist who believes it. But apparently, this is not what the Phillips curve is about. No, according to Laffer, the Phillips curve is the idea that growth itself causes inflation. That is a really dumb theory. No wonder so few of us actually believe it. All this time I thought I believed in the Phillips curve, when actually what I believed was something quite different.</p></blockquote>
<p>KNZN nails Laffer on not knowing the difference between SHIFTS OF a curve versus SHIFTS ALONG a curve.  No surprise there, but there is a surprise in the fact that <a href="http://www.poorandstupid.com/2006_08_20_chronArchive.asp#115643918392257273">Donald Luskin</a> also spotted Laffer’s stupidity.  Brad used to refer to Luskin as the stupidest man alive.  I think we have a new candidate.</p>

                                <p>On Saturday, I criticized certain rightwing comments on the 1996 welfare “reform” legislation by noting that the use of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/welfare-caseloads-real-research-not-to.html">welfare caseloads</a> as the metric for judging the alleged success of this program was misleading.  Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/08/shut_your_eyes_.html">Mark Thoma</a> we see <a href="http://robertreich.blogspot.com/2006/08/welfare-deform-sad-anniversary.html">Robert Reich</a> finishing the thought process that I stopped woefully short of doing: <br />
<blockquote>I keep reading that welfare reform succeeded because welfare rolls were reduced. Of course they were reduced. People were kicked off welfare. How could they not be reduced?</p></blockquote>
<p>Precisely my point.  Of course, Robert put so eloquently what I did not really bother to write.  The rest of his post is well worth the read.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: A reader of Robert’s blog points us to <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/08/22/happy-birthday-welfare-reform">Michael Tanner</a> praising the 1996 legislation:<br />
<blockquote>Now, with 10 years of experience, we can see that those claims were about as correct as claims of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Welfare rolls are down. Roughly 2.5 million families have left the program, a 57 percent decline.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Robert has already devastated the misuse of welfare caseloads to proxy poverty reduction.  Tanner later noted that poverty rates in 2004 were lower than they were in 1996.  Well DUH!  Poverty rates fell a lot during the late 1990&#8217;s boom but have been rising since.</p>
