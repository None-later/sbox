                                <p>The IRS <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/05fallbu.pdf">Quarterly Statistics of Income Report</a> has hundreds of pages of new numbers, but one well respected tax publication provides this summary:<br />
<blockquote>The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts shrunk individual income tax revenues in 2003 despite a rise in taxable income and forced over 400,000 new taxpayers onto the rolls of the alternative minimum tax, according to IRS data released on December 21.  The IRS’s latest Statistics of Income Bulletin showed total individual taxable income rising 2.5 percent to $4.2 trillion from 2002 to 2003. But despite the extra $90 million in taxable income in 2003, the IRS found that total individual income tax collected actually fell 6.1 percent to $748 billion as a result of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA).  “This was the third successive year that total income tax declined,” the report said. “The decline in total income tax for 2003 reflects the reduction in tax rates under JGTRRA.” Total revenue would have declined even further, the report found, had AMT revenues not conversely jumped 38.2 percent, with 23.4 percent more taxpayers paying the tax. “This is largely attributable to the decrease in ordinary tax rates due to JGTRRA, while the tax rates on alternative minimum taxable income remained the same as 2002,” the report said. “Over 0.4 million more taxpayers were required to pay the AMT for 2003.” … The IRS also found that a 23 percent jump in total capital gains and dividends income was responsible for a large portion of the 2003 increase in taxable income, with wage and salary income rising just 2 percent. Capital gains and dividends income received the largest tax rate cuts under JGTRRA, contributing to the decline in revenues. The IRS report found that all income classes but the lowest saw smaller average tax rates in 2003, but that higher-income groups received a much larger percentage tax cut. “The lower average rates for these higher-income returns not only reflect the decrease in tax rates on ordinary income but also a new preferential tax rate for certain qualified dividends and long-term capital gains sold after May 5, 2003, which were introduced in JGTRRA,” the report stated.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/21/AR2005122100748.html">budget-cutting action</a> by the Senate highlights the major problem faced by those who want to cut government spending: it is deeply unpopular to do so. </p>
<p>The &#8216;starve the beast&#8217; notion that cutting taxes leads to large deficits, which in turn forces spending cuts, has already been <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/huh.html">completely</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/starve-beast-theory-revisited.html">repeatedly</a> debunked.  But the difficulty with which the solid Republican majorities in both houses passed tiny, tiny spending cuts ($8 billion per year out of a budget of $2,500 billion per year) is remarkable.  The vote in the House was 212-206, while the vote in the Senate was 51-50.  This highlights the fact that &#8216;starving the beast&#8217; simply won&#8217;t reduce the size of government, because even Republican representatives are reluctant to cut spending.</p>
<p>The reason is, of course, that the American people by and large like the size of the federal government.  They like the things that it spends money on.  And because members of Congress know that cutting spending will be unpopular and hurt their chances for reelection, they won&#8217;t really do it in any meaningful way, no matter how large deficits become.  </p>
<p>One last note, which is really a quibble with the Washington Post.  Their lead paragraph read:<br />
<blockquote>Senate Republicans, by the narrowest margin yesterday, pushed through a major budget measure that would trim federal spending by nearly $40 billion over five years, but they were stymied by Democrats in their effort to open Alaska&#8217;s wilderness to oil drilling.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Major&#8221; budget measure???   I don&#8217;t know any metric by which a change in spending of 0.3% should be called major&#8230;</p>
<p>Kash</p>

<blockquote>President Bill Clinton left office in 2001 with a federal budget surplus of $127 billion. President George Bush ran a deficit of $319 billion in 2005. So who deserves more credit for fighting red ink? No question, says Treasury Secretary John Snow: It&#8217;s his boss, Bush. Sipping a latte at a Starbucks coffee shop with reporters in Washington two days ago, he said that &#8220;the president&#8217;s legacy will be one of having significantly reduced the deficit in his time,&#8221; and said Clinton&#8217;s budget was a &#8220;mirage&#8221; and &#8220;wasn&#8217;t a real surplus.&#8221; Snow said the Clinton surplus was inflated by a stock-price bubble and that Bush will be remembered for cutting the gap from a record $412 billion in the 2004 fiscal year.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK – to say the historical figures are not real is either incredibly stupid or dishonest.  But let’s read further:<br />
<blockquote>Government forecasts for continued surpluses depended on those tax payments continuing, Snow, 66, said. “You&#8217;re going to make a lot of mistakes if you forecast based on a bubble,” he said. “Bubbles burst.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a limited but important point in this statement.  If we realize that we have a one-time and temporary piece of goods news on tax collections and one is silly enough to extrapolate some long-run deficit forecast based on the false assumption that this one-time surge is permanent, one will make a mistake.  But that is exactly what this Administration is doing when they claim that current fiscal policy will see a sizeable reduction in the deficit over the next few years.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The need for speed is one of the specious arguments put forth by President Bush for the end-run around the FISA Courts.  Never mind the fact that the FISA Courts act quickly and have approved over 99% of the requests made over the years.  Never mind the fact that the government can wiretap even before getting a warrant.  So I was wondering what the rightwing would come up as their latest in lame excuses for the excesses of this White House – and it seems <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york200512191334.asp">Byron York</a> exceeded expectations: <br />
<blockquote>At his news conference this morning, the president explained that he believed the U.S. government had to &#8220;be able to act fast&#8221; to intercept the &#8220;international communications of people with known links to al Qaeda.&#8221; &#8220;Al Qaeda was not a conventional enemy,&#8221; Bush said. &#8220;This new threat required us to think and act differently.&#8221; But there&#8217;s more to the story than that. In 2002, when the president made his decision, there was widespread, bipartisan frustration with the slowness and inefficiency of the bureaucracy involved in seeking warrants from the special intelligence court, known as the FISA court. Even later, after the provisions of the Patriot Act had had time to take effect, there were still problems with the FISA court &#8211; problems examined by members of the September 11 Commission &#8211; and questions about whether the court can deal effectively with the fastest-changing cases in the war on terror. People familiar with the process say the problem is not so much with the court itself as with the process required to bring a case before the court. &#8220;It takes days, sometimes weeks, to get the application for FISA together,&#8221; says one source. &#8220;It&#8217;s not so much that the court doesn&#8217;t grant them quickly, it&#8217;s that it takes a long time to get to the court. Even after the Patriot Act, it&#8217;s still a very cumbersome process.</p></blockquote>
<p>At first, I thought this was a slap in the face of our government officials – saying they were so incompetent that we had to throw out the Constitution because they could not get their bureaucratic act together.  I was wondering if Mr. York would provide a single example of his thesis – when he did:<br />
<blockquote>Lawmakers of both parties recognized the problem in the months after the September 11 terrorist attacks. They pointed to the case of Coleen Rowley, the FBI agent who ran up against a number roadblocks in her effort to secure a FISA warrant in the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, the al Qaeda operative who had taken flight training in preparation for the hijackings.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the same example provided by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/19/AR2005121901027.html">William Kristol and Gary Schmitt</a>, but notice this is a pre-9/11 example.  Let us recall that the bulldog of the Clinton era, Richard Clarke, was hounding Condi Rice at the NSA to break down the bureaucratic barriers and to “shake the trees” but Dr. Rice simply ignored Mr. Clarke.  So the York-Kristol-Schmitt thesis seems to be that her incompetence granted her boss the right to violate the Constitution and our liberties.  </p>
<p>But as I think about it – suppose that we had an effective NSA today (after all, Dr. Rice was moved out of NSA over to head the State Department) that wanted to spy on some anti-war protestor.  I bet that the Administration would find it difficult to write their request for a warrant – especially if that individual was last found protesting a war over <a href="http://ice.he.net/~freepnet/kerry">30 year ago</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: A <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/20/AR2005122000685.html">FISA judge</a> resigns in protest.  Also, a few AB readers reminded me that NSA in the alphabet soup of D.C. talk refers to the National Security Agency and not the former <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1851930,00.html">National Security Advisor</a> who to this date has not learned how to tell the truth:<br />
<blockquote>United States secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, has denied US president George W Bush ordered illegal domestic spying. However, she would not comment on reports that US phones and e-mails are monitored without court approval.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Update II</strong></em>: AB reader Lena keeps pointing to the Chicago Tribune op-ed from <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2005/12/21/appeals-court-myth">John Schmidt</a>.  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2005/12/21/appeals-court-myth">Thinkprogress</a> provides the rebuttal.  Which brings up an important point – the rightwing apologists for Bush are parading a host of former Clinton officials as some sort of justification for Bush’s illegal activity.  Even if someone from the Clinton White House said this illegal act was OK by them, I don’t care.  But as Thinkprogress also points out in other posts – the apologists are not being honest in many respects.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>From <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051219-2.html">Bush’s press conference</a> yesterday, justifying his violation of US laws:<br />
<blockquote>“[I]t was a shameful act for someone to disclose this very important program in a time of war.”<br />“We&#8217;re at war, and we must protect America&#8217;s secrets.”<br />“[T]his is a different &#8212; a different era, a different war.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Given how centrally Bush is relying on the notion that the US is currently at “war” against terrorists when explaining his authority to override US law (note that the &#8220;war&#8221; he is referring to is not the war in Iraq, but rather the &#8220;War on Terror&#8221;), there is one central, crucial question that I think the press corps needs to ask again and again, until it is answered:  <em><strong>When will this “war” end?  </strong></em></p>
<p>Will the US be in a “time of war” forever?  If not, when will the US be able to declare victory in this “war”?  When there is no person left on the planet who would like to commit an act of terrorism?  When there is no person left in the world who would like to harm Americans?  When there are just 10 terrorists left, or 100, or 1000? What are the possible scenarios under which this “war” could be declared to be finished?  Or is this state of &#8220;war&#8221; for the US permanent?</p>
<p>Bush was asked something similar yesterday and refused to answer.  But a straightfoward answer to this question would be hugely illuminating, because the answer would tell us Bush&#8217;s view about when the President will have to resume upholding the laws of the United States.</p>

<blockquote>Republican House and Senate leaders finalized agreements yesterday on a $41.6 billion budget-cutting plan that includes tough medicine for Medicaid recipients and on a massive defense spending bill that would open the Alaskan wilderness to oil drilling.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s just over $8 billion per year – and as the story continues:<br />
<blockquote>The agreement would cut less than one-half of 1 percent from a projected $14.3 trillion in federal spending over the next five years. Depending on the outcome of negotiations over as much as $60 billion in tax cuts, the savings in spending could vanish.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story goes onto to note how the Democrats are furious that this ANWR provision was stuck in the defense department bill and how certain individuals will lose out from the big cuts in small programs.  I just wish it spent more time talking about the increases in spending for that massive budget given to Sec. Rumsfeld.</p>

                                <p>Consider the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200512190909.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> on monetary policy:<br />
<blockquote>I still can’t forgive the central bank for decimating and deflating the bullish stock market economy five years ago, a move that temporarily ended the great productivity surge of the Internet revolution.</p></blockquote>
<p>After all, the fact that the employment-to-population ratio was over 64% was no indication of a strong labor market.  Just look at the fact that gold prices were near $250 an ounce – so said Kudlow and his crowd.  But the new and improved Kudlow is not calling for tight money even though he thinks an employment-to-population ratio less than 63% is wonderful:<br />
<blockquote>Now, some of my supply-side friends take issue with my optimistic view on inflation. They believe the recent run-up in gold prices to over $500 an ounce signals excess money creation and much more inflation ahead. Therefore, some argue, the central bank must keep tightening and raising its target rate for at least another year. But I believe this is a 1970s view — one that abstracts from the Internet Google revolution and the record productivity surge, and also ignores the global spread of capitalism, which has taken hold in the post-Reagan years and has increased the demand for scarce commodities across the board &#8230; This does not mean that gold is irrelevant as a monetary signal; but it does suggest that the Fed is on the right track with what appears to be a newly created bond-price-rule approach to policy. In other words, the central bank seems to be using the bond market as its leading real-world indicator &#8230; For years, conservative economists have argued for a well-defined price rule.</p></blockquote>
<p>These passages are from someone who has argued in the past for a commodity price-rule.</p>

<blockquote>HONG KONG, China (CNN) &#8211; Ministers from 149 states have saved long-running global trade talks from collapse with an interim deal to end farm export subsidies by 2013 and open up markets in wealthier countries to the world&#8217;s poorest nations … The draft, which appears to be a compromise, calles for subsidies to be progressively ceased. But ministers said it would keep alive plans for a wider pact freeing up global trade, known as the Doha round, that could boost the world economy and lift millions out of poverty.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I applaud the call for a reduction in agricultural subsidies, I also seem to recall a paper by <a href="http://www.nber.org/cgi-bin/author_papers.pl?author=nava_ashraf">Nava Ashraf, Margaret McMillan, and Alix Peterson Zwane</a> with the following abstract:<br />
<blockquote>Using non-parametric analysis we establish the fact that the majority of poor countries are currently net food importers and have been for the past thirty years. Using a a cross-country regression framework we measure the overall impact of agricultural support policies in rich countries on average income per capita in poor countries. We find some evidence that OECD support polices are positively correlated with average incomes in food-importing countries and negatively correlated with average incomes in food-exporting countries.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>In a paper published in April, three economists &#8211; Nava Ashraf from Harvard, Margaret McMillan from Tufts, and Alix Peterson Zwane from the University of California, Berkeley, concluded that agricultural supports boosted the per capita income of two-thirds of 77 developing nations, including most of the poorest countries, like Burundi and Zambia. </p></blockquote>

<p>The largest drop was in &#8220;Traffic of Prospective Buyers&#8221;.  The Traffic component fell to 39 from 46 in November.</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.nahb.org/news_details.aspx?sectionID=134&#038;newsID=1649">Builder Sentiment Cools Further In December</a><br />
<blockquote>Confidence of single-family home builders slid further this month from its summer peak, yet remained well within the positive range, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) for December, released today. The overall HMI declined four points from a slightly revised November number to 57, while the component measuring builder expectations for future sales held firm at 65.</p>
<p>“Many builders sense some tapering off of single-family buyer demand, but remain reasonably confident in the ongoing strength of their markets,” said NAHB President Dave Wilson, a custom home builder from Ketchum, Idaho. “They obviously are reacting to higher interest rates and energy costs, along with some buyer resistance to high house prices.”</p>
<p>“As expected, the housing market appears to be coming off the recent record pace of home sales,” said NAHB Chief Economist David Seiders. “Our surveys indicate that three out of every four builders are experiencing some buyer resistance to current home prices, and many are offering certain concessions to buyers in order to help maintain sales volume. NAHB’s forecast continues to anticipate an orderly cooling down process for single-family sales and production in 2006.”</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The BEA released its estimate of the <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/newsrel/transnewsrelease.htm">US current account balance</a> for the third quarter of 2005:<br />
<blockquote>The U.S. current-account deficit&#8211;the combined balances on trade in goods and services, income, and net unilateral current transfers&#8211;decreased to $195.8 billion (preliminary) in the third quarter of 2005 from $197.8 billion (revised) in the second quarter.  The decrease was more than accounted for by a decrease in net outflows for unilateral current transfers, a shift to a surplus on income from a deficit, and an increase in the surplus on services.  In contrast, the deficit on goods increased.</p></blockquote>
<p>More interesting to me than the current account, however, are some of the details contained in the capital account. </p>
<p>The capital account is that portion of the balance of payments table that tracks international purchases and sales of assets, rather than goods and services. Today&#8217;s figures confirm that foreign central banks have, as far as we can tell, significantly slowed their purchases of dollar assets compared to the pace in 2004. On the other hand, private firms and individuals abroad have been steadily increasing their appetite for US paper assets &#8211; stocks, bonds, and bank accounts &#8211; as the following chart illustrates. </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/cap_inflows3.jpg"></p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth mentioning that these two phenomena (greater private capital flows into the US, smaller purchases of dollar assets by foreign central banks) are intimately related. Central banks have been able to reduce their purchases of dollar assets precisely because private agents around the world have been more willing to accumulate dollar assets. And looked at the other way, private agents may be more willing to hold dollar assets because it appears that the pressure on the dollar (as measured by how many of them foreign central banks are being forced to buy) has diminished substantially this year. </p>
<p>For whatever reason, it seems that confidence in the dollar and in US paper assets (note that foreigners have not yet regained their appetite for direct investment in the US, i.e. for directly purchasing US firms or building up their US businesses) has grown in 2005.  Fears of an immediate fall in the dollar do not seem widespread among the world&#8217;s investors.</p>
