                                                                            <a href="./../category/social-security/index.html" class="post-category-44" title="social security"><div class="color-box"></div>social security</a>                                                                     </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <blockquote><p>Even before the latest flooding, a group representing engineers said the United States needed to spend about $1 trillion more than it does now to bring infrastructure up to par with modern needs and standards.</p></blockquote>
<p> Wow. A trillion dollars is a lot of money. But as it happens we have in fact an identified revenue stream that is more or less coincidentally projected to run just about that amount in cash surpluses over the next decade, and more than double that if you include interest accrued on the existing fund balances. That is if we take a little look at the dollar figures in the following table: <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_SRest.html#253691">Table IV.A3.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 2003-17 1 [Amounts in billions]</a></p>
<p>So here is the deal. First I propose that we take all cash surpluses from FICA and invest them in interest earning state and local construction bonds. That alone gets you about $600-700 billion over the next decade (and all before Social Security is projected to run into a shortfall where cash income from tax falls behind cost). Assuming Intermediate Cost projections. Under Low Cost cash surpluses extend to 2023, and of course under outcomes better than IC but trailing LC you get dates in between. In any event we have a minimum ten year window to invest these already existing funds in infrastructure, and by reinvesting earnings on the muni bonds get pretty close to backfilling the whole gap. Because it gets better. Highway, bridge and school construction are all labor intensive undertakings, even more so when you take into account the wages of the people supplying the concrete and steel, to say nothing about the wages of the people who sell groceries and beer to the guys that spend their days working at the cement plant. Which is to say Social Security not only earns whatever return it gets directly on the bond, it also captures 12.4% of every contract dollar that ultimately goes to wages. Cha-ching!! I don&#8217;t know how you would calculate the Return On Investment on that combination. But I suspect you are creeping real close to double digit returns.</p>
<p>There is a risk that the budgeteers, being deprived of this source of cheap borrowing, would simply respond by cutting transportation spending from the General Fund. But not only is this response not likely, it wouldn&#8217;t really matter if it did happen. Why? Well follow me below the fold.</p>
<p>Why would a total spending offset be unlikely? Because Congressmen and Senators really, really like to take credit for infrastucture projects, that is how you get highways, bridges and airports named after you. If you set up a system where Social Security surpluses were invested evenly by Congressional District it would be hard for any individual Congressman to claim credit, after all it is just workers&#8217; money being reinvested creating jobs for workers. So I suspect some extra money would always be flowing, earmarks are not going away totally, transformed perhaps but not vanishing.</p>
<p>As to why spending offsets wouldn&#8217;t really matter so much if they happened. Well as long as the total effect isn&#8217;t negative, that is less net dollars going to these kind of projects, the total benefits far outweigh the foregone spending. But before we go there let me put stage two into play.</p>
<p>Along with using the current cash surpluses I would argue that the General Fund should take a proactive approach to the Trust Fund and invest an amount equal to the amount of the interest being accrued on the current Trust Funds into the Infrastructure Investment Fund. This would have the effect of freezing the Trust Fund in place at about $2.6 trillion (if we could get this done in <s>2029</s> 2009). Which is not a bad thing, not at all. Freezing the Trust Fund means freeing our children and grandchildren from trillions of dollars in future General Fund debt. Of course they will be on the hook for paying off the transportation and school bonds but at least they will be able to see what they were paying for in literally concrete terms.</p>
<p>Now it is worth noting that funding for the Infrastructure Fund doesn&#8217;t stop at the actual shortfall date when income from taxes trails costs, as long as the interest being earned on the Trust Fund exceeds the remaining gap the Infrastructure Fund would still be credited with the overage, under Intermediate Cost projections you would be getting some money from this mechanism all the way until 2023.</p>
<p>At which point we would need to make a decision. The easy answer would be to start drawing down on the assets of the Infrastructure Fund, that is rather than reivesting its earnings we could start using them in conjunction with Trust Fund redemptions to extend the period when the General Fund has to transfer cash. Or we could simply bite the bullet and pay for the entire gap between income from tax and cost by direct redemptions of the Special Treasuries. The net result would be that the Trust Fund would be reduced to its target of a 100 Trust Fund ratio even faster than projected. On the other hand this would give the Infrastructure Fund that many more years of compounding through reinvestment.</p>
<p>So what is the end game here? Well some fifteen to twenty years down the road we have us a Trust Fund holding its accepted minimum level of reserves, still presumedly held in Special Treasures. We also have a revenue stream via FICA and tax on benefits that was significantly augmented by additional wage dollars from the infrastructure investment in the meantime. Then we have an independent Infrastructure Fund that can be tapped to backfill any gap between then current income and then current cost.</p>
<p>I kind of like this picture. One it puts the intergenerational equity problem to rest for all time, current benefits would be paid out of a combination of current tax and current returns on real assets. Two it blows away the phony &#8216;Phony IOU&#8217; argument. Three it shuts up those who would blather about how returns on equities magically out earn returns on Treasuries, they simply will not be able to match the reliability of munis at equivalent rates of return (or go for it in comments). Four and most interesting perhaps it moves financing of Social Security into progressive directions without it being turned into welfare. Because states and localities have two major sources of income: property tax and sales tax. Want to live in that big ass house, really need that thirty foot speedboat, or sixty foot cruiser, or houseful of designer furniture, or that Bentley? Well know that some portion of your property tax and sales tax is going to repay bond dollars borrowed from wage workers. Instead of approaching Mr. Rich cap in hand for a handout, Mr. Worker ends up in the position of creditor.</p>
<p>All in all a lot better way of securing some infrastructure funding over at least the near term than trying to raise it through the Lotto.</p>

                                <p>Tom&#8217;s post yesterday about British housing (following Felix), <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/top-o-bubble-to-you-england.html">where the volume was down significantly with the average slightly up</a>, seemed rather intuitive if you buy the argument that the majority of house prices haven&#8217;t been cut enough, and won&#8217;t sell until they cut more.*</p>
<p>But, courtesy of our fellow <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/10-best-gloom-and-doom-sites.html">Gloom-and-Doom maven</a>, <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/">Barry Ritholtz at The Big Picture</a>, we can see that prices rising as sales decline is <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/07/ism-update.html">not unique to housing</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Money quote from the ISM bossman: &#8220;When viewed from the manufacturer’s perspective, they are experiencing higher prices for their inputs while demand for their products is slowing.&#8221;**</p></blockquote>
<p>Take the extra money now, guys. You&#8217;re going to need it as inventories accumulate.</p>
<p>*I don&#8217;t buy that one completely, mainly because housing is <em>not</em> a liquid market unless it&#8217;s bubblicious.  Also, houses are not commodities: people react to them differently, and are more likely not to buy because of something other than price.</p>
<p>**There is a formatting issue at TBP that implies this is a quote from the NYT. It&#8217;s not; it&#8217;s original to TBP.</p>

<p>Not that I want to reinforce our doom-and-gloom reputation or anything, but the Bush administration is demonstrating its inability to walk and chew gum at the same time by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/washington/02military.html">losing in Afghanistan</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>A recent Pentagon report about Afghanistan painted a stark picture of security conditions inside the country, a militant force that had “coalesced into a resilient insurgency” and a central government in Kabul that still could not extend its reach into the hinterlands. An American commander, Maj. Gen. Jeffrey J. Schloesser, has said that militant attacks on coalition troops increased by 40 percent from January to May compared with the same period last year. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason is that for the small fortune that&#8217;s been appropriated for that war, there aren&#8217;t enough resources there to keep the Taliban at bay:<br />
<blockquote>General McNeill said the Afghanistan mission “needs more maneuver units, it needs more flying machines, it needs more intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance units.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem, as any student of the place would know, is that Afghanistan is the asymmetric warrior&#8217;s paradise, with a long history prior to the Soviet invasion of chewing up notionally superior forces.  Incidentally, this is part of the reason why the partisan in me would be almost as happy to see <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/05/MN222557.DTL">Condoleezza Rice</a> as McCain&#8217;s running mate as I would Mittens.  Not only would I make a sizeable donation to anyone willing to run an ad featuring her recounting the title of the &#8220;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/08/rice.transcript/">Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States</a>&#8221; memo, but also she must be either totally ineffectual and unprincipled [*] or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice#Academic_career">worst Sovietologist ever</a> [**] not to have tried convincing the other Bushies to really win in Afghanistan first or to resign having tried but failed.</p>
<p>Comparing the candidates, Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/issues/iraq/">Iraq page</a> notes the rivalry for resources, and the plan (<a href="http://www.barackobama.com/issues/pdf/IraqFactSheet.pdf">pdf</a>) calls for shifting some U.S. military resources freed from Iraq to Afghanistan; McCain keeps Afghanistan off his <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/fdeb03a7-30b0-4ece-8e34-4c7ea83f11d8.htm">Iraq page</a> and seems to promote the blunter and more expensive instrument of a <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/054184f4-6b51-40dd-8964-54fcf66a1e68.htm">larger standing military</a> as the answer to resource limitations in fighting the <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2123412">GSAVE</a>.</p>
<p>[*] The unprincipled part is is pretty much a given.</p>
<p>[**] Before you start debating me on worse Sovietologists, please note the &#8220;worst X ever&#8221; formulation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN0127639020080701">Reuters</a> carries a report on an infrastrucutre concern:</p>
<blockquote><p>The worst Midwest flooding since 1993 has generated images of swamped towns, cracked roads, washed-out bridges, overwhelmed dams, failed levees, broken sewage systems, stunted crops and water-logged refugees. The losses are in the billions of dollars and still mounting, as the costs of crop losses alone send shocks through the inflation-wracked world food system and threaten insurers.</p>
<p>The disaster has reminded policymakers of the decrepit state of U.S. infrastructure, stirring concerns similar to those following the deadly Minneapolis bridge collapse in 2007 and the flooding of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.</p>
<p>Even before the latest flooding, a group representing engineers said the United States needed to spend about $1 trillion more than it does now to bring infrastructure up to par with modern needs and standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;The patch-and-pray approach simply won&#8217;t succeed,&#8221; said David Mongan, head of the American Society of Civil Engineers.</p>
<p>But the group also said its five-year cost estimate was outdated and does not count the price of new roads, rails, and sewers required by a growing population, nor the cost to repair damage inflicted by the recent Midwest floods.</p>
<p>President George W. Bush has asked Congress for $1.8 billion to boost funds for flood recovery but it is unclear how much of that money will end up in infrastructure repair.</p>
<p>Presidential candidates vying to succeed him have each promised quick action in Congress and offered some ideas for the larger task of repairing infrastructure.</p>
<p>Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has proposed creating a $60 billion fund for infrastructure projects, funded by money saved by a promised withdrawal from the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>&#8220;This can be the moment when we make a generational commitment to rebuild our infrastructure,&#8221; Obama told business executives in Pittsburgh last week.</p>
<p>Everywhere You Look</p>
<p>Each need sounds dire: new wastewater treatment so sewage does not taint the same waterways that supply drinking water; repairs or replacements for thousands of corroded bridges; new and repaired dams and levees that will not fail; and upgrades to airports and air traffic control.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need profound changes,&#8221; said engineer Kumares Sinha of Purdue University. &#8220;We can&#8217;t live in a fool&#8217;s paradise.&#8221;</p>
<p>While rising economic powers China and India build highways and other large projects, U.S. infrastructure &#8211; once the envy of the world &#8211; has fallen into decline, Sinha said.</p>
<p>Two federal commissions since Katrina have tackled the issue and Congress is mulling proposals for a full-scale assessment of the nation&#8217;s infrastructure needs and an infrastructure &#8220;bank&#8221; to loan money for projects.</p>
<p>But Sinha and other experts said the analysis should go deeper to reflect an economy likely to face higher fuel prices for the foreseeable future. Policymakers need to consider new methods of reducing road congestion, for example, whether by charging more to use them or exacting fees for entering city centers, which will generate revenue for mass transit.</p>
<p>The nation also may have to reconsider its lukewarm commitment to passenger rail service, experts said.</p>
<p>Government funding for some infrastructure needs has declined, such as for wastewater plants. Municipalities hike taxes or fees to repair ancient pipes prone to bursting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody is drinking somebody&#8217;s waste water,&#8221; said Susan Bruninga of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies.</p>
<p>The state of Illinois is weighing its first capital improvement project in a decade, hoping to back $31 billion in bonds by leasing the lottery and building a casino in Chicago.</p></blockquote>
<p>Illinois will fund infrastructure through gambling monies?</p>
<p>(Another thought is how the floods have hit the corn and soybean market?)</p>

                                <p>If you were wise enough to skip Jonah Goldberg’s attack on Obama’s <a href="http://blogs.usatoday.com/oped/2008/07/obamas-real-pat.html">patriotism</a> &#8211; save your time and just check out the takedown from <a href="http://www.jedreport.com/2008/07/jonah-goldberg.html">Jed Report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In his trademarked pseudo-intellectual style, Jonah launches a full-on smear against Barack Obama, claiming that Barack has a &#8220;patriotism problem.&#8221; To make his case, Jonah digs up a quote of Barack saying &#8220;I&#8217;m going to try to tell the American people what I believe will make this country great and, hopefully, that will be a testimony to my patriotism.&#8221; … So Barack Obama has a patriotism problem because&#8230;he wants to to make the country great.  Obviously, it&#8217;s a stupid argument &#8212; only someone who hates America would not want to make it great, and only the world&#8217;s biggest idiot (which Jonah may well be) would suggest that America is right now as great as it has been in the past.</p></blockquote>
<p>The world biggest idiot just had to respond with even more <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MzRjMWFmNmZiYTFlNTMxYWU1NTRjZjZhNGE3NjgyY2U=">stupidity</a>, which not only included how adding “again” makes all the difference but also this gem:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the key difference is that invoking scripture, or similar language, in order to justify shrinking government at home and liberating mankind from collectivism abroad is quite different than invoking government to justify an enormous expansion of the state into people&#8217;s lives. Reagan did not believe that government was the instrument of salvation, he believed it was the obstacle to what is best in ourselves and in our nation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Credit to <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/07/jonah-vs-big-go.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> for this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;An enormous expansion of the state into people&#8217;s lives&#8221;. What does Jonah think Bush has been doing these past eight years?</p></blockquote>
<p>But maybe Jonah is referring to Kudlow’s claim that Reagan cut government spending.  Of course, other conservatives blame the Reagan deficits on an explosion of government spending.  Funny thing – Federal spending as a share of GDP neither rose nor fell during the Reagan years.  So when Jonah says “shrinking government at home” – he displays his world class stupidity once again.</p>

<p>Barry had a note about Greg Mankiw being gloomy.  It became quite apparent in the descriptions that we need to re-write our blog description and make it available on site for such occasions.  More than just &#8220;left of center etc.&#8221;.</p>
<p>Still, certainly in good company.  Are we so gloomy folks?</p>

<p><a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/06/whats-causing-h.html#more%20">Andrew Sullivan</a> finds the discussion of the oil market by <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2008/07/07/080707ta_talk_surowiecki">James Surowiecki</a> illuminating.  I’m not so sure.   Let me begin with this confusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Between 2000 and 2007, world demand for petroleum rose by nearly nine million barrels a day, but OPEC has been consistently unable, or unwilling, to significantly increase supply, and production by non-OPEC members has risen by just four million barrels a day.</p></blockquote>
<p>But wait a second – doesn’t the quantity demanded equal the quantity supplied at the market clearing price?  If Surowiecki is trying to say that the demand curve shifted outwards along a fairly inelastic supply curve – then maybe we have a pretty good explanation of the rise in oil prices.  The Excel file from the <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/ipsr/t21.xls">Energy Information Administration</a> has some useful information from 2003 to 2007 including total world demand and total world supply – which both grew by about 5 million barrels per day from 2003 to 2006.  During this period, OPEC supply grew by almost 4 million barrels per day.   Now from 2006 to 2007, world demand growth seems to have outstripped world supply growth with the difference being world demand and world supply being either reported draw downs of inventories or the “statistical discrepancy”.  Given their data has most of this difference being the statistical discrepancy – it is hard to pin down precisely what their data is telling us. </p>
<p>Surowiecki argues against the usual suspects – market manipulation by greedy oil companies or speculative forces – and he’s likely correct.  But then he argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>But there’s also something else at work, which the oil guru Daniel Yergin calls a “shortage psychology.” The price of oil—more than that of many other commodities—isn’t based solely on current supply and demand. It’s also based on people’s expectations about future supply and demand, because those expectations determine whether it makes sense for oil producers to sell their oil now or leave it in the ground and sell it later. Currently, the market is assuming that oil will become scarcer, and that global demand will keep rising, especially in rapidly developing countries like China and India. As a result, producers are asking very high prices to pump their oil. Now, it could be that these assumptions are all wrong—that the supply of oil will not be constricted going forward, that concerns about the Middle East are exaggerated, and that higher prices will lead people to cut back on energy consumption, shrinking demand. In that case, oil would turn out to have been hugely overpriced. But that won’t be because of sinister speculators; it will be because oil producers and oil users collectively misread the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why would anyone assume that the assumptions of rising world demand and shrinking supply be wrong?  What if they are correct?  Then couldn’t the current market price be a rational response to these rational expectations?  Which might leave one to argue that allowing the market to work is the preferred policy to all the nonsense we are hearing from politicians such as John McCain.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.peer.org/docs/nps/08_26_6_proposed_gun_regulations.pdf">PEER</a> notes that:</p>
<blockquote><p>On April 30, 2008, the U.S. Interior Department proposed to repeal nearly century-old national park rules requiring that firearms be unloaded and unavailable for ready use. In its place, the Bush administration would substitute the various laws governing “any state park, or any similar unit of state land, in which state the federal park, or that portion thereof, is located…”<br />&#8230;.<br />The current National Park Service (NPS) regulation was re-written in 1983 under the Reagan administration and was intended to relax earlier strict prohibitions. As the NPS then explained: “[T]he Service has determined that it is not feasible to prohibit the possession of weapons in all situations, and a total prohibition would be unenforceable” (48 FR 30256). The current regulation (36 CFR 2.4) reads –</p>
<p>“…unloaded weapons may be possessed within a temporary lodging or mechanical mode of conveyance when such implements are rendered temporarily inoperable or are packed, cased or stored in a manner that will prevent their ready use.”</p>
<p>It is precisely these sort of rules that the majority opinion in the Supreme Court ruling in the District of Columbia v. Heller case appears to uphold when it denied that the decision would affect “laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings” (at 54).</p>
<p>Since its origin, the national park system has forbidden or severely restricted hunting, making carrying restrictions a key anti-poaching strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf">US Supreme Court decision</a> in District of Columbia vs. Heller ascribes an individual&#8217;s right to possess a firearm in the home for defense, the NRA has said it will challenge gun laws in many states based on the ruling.</p>
<p>Many in the NRA appear to believe in an absolute right to own guns, but would be reluctant to claim it since there are some obvious exceptions that seem pretty reasonable for individuals depending on age, mental capacity, danger to society, and such.</p>
<p>Would someone please explain to me the difference between being allowed to carry a loaded gun in a park versus one tucked away &#8220;not available for ready use&#8221;? I for one would not like people carrying firearms ready for use as we stroll looking at the deer, or walking up the Lincoln Memorial.</p>
<p>Update:  STR and Mcwop say: &#8220;Most firearms owners only want common sense. Most of the time law enforcement officials show common sense, but sometimes not.&#8221;</p>
