<p>I hit the daily double with Obama/Edwards the other night, and Huckleberry/Romney on the other side.  My betting friends are going to pay off in wine, happily for the in-laws.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s clearly a great yearning for change in this  country, and we&#8217;re at a watershed moment, which is going to be exacerbated by the recession this year.  Buffpilot may be correct that the &#8220;economy, stupid&#8221; becomes the #1 issue in the race.</p>
<p>Given that even the best politicians like Obama can turn into slippery weasels in a race like this, it&#8217;s still necessary to put unrelenting pressure on the two parties to  start helping the country and its citizens.  How to do so, when you know your Congress critters ignore every word you say?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an outfit called &#8220;Unity 08&#8221; out there that purports to be a bipartisan effort to elect a &#8220;unity government&#8221; in 2008.  It&#8217;s website is www.Unity08.com.  Maybe it&#8217;s quixotic or even off the mark, since it pinpoints excessive partisanship as the problem in national politics today.  The American Prospect characterizes it thus :</p>
<blockquote><p>Newsweek ran a brief profile of Sam Waterston, Law and Order mainstay, great actor, and all-around lovely guy &#8212; but, unfortunately, also the celebrity spokesman for one of the lamer examples of establishment anti-politics currently around, Unity08.com. All told, the threat to the republic posed by nasty partisanship is about as real as the threat to seniors posed by medicine-hungry robots. </p></blockquote>
<p>Unity08.com has an online &#8220;convention&#8221; in June where you pick a slate of candidates for President and VP.  State organizations can also get the Unity party registered to be on the ballot of that state with enough signatures.  And the platform is chosen by popular demand on the issues.  It&#8217;s free and there&#8217;s not much but a little time to lose.</p>
<p>It may be fruitless, but here&#8217;s a possibility: that Bloomberg and company will fund publicity for Unity, and offer candidates willing to run from both parties.  Then you&#8217;d have a third party movement explode into the limelight, IMHO.  Unity08 is maybe only one tiny vehicle to keep up the pressure but could be more if Bloomberg gets active in financing centrist candidates, if the parties don&#8217;t please voters.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a better way to keep up the pressure on both parties to be responsive to voters, what is it?  </p>

                                <p>For those of you interested in state capitalism, I have been following Huawei&#8217;s interest in 3-Com. Today, that story hit the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/05/AR2008010502608_2.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post.</a><br />Because 3-Com makes hacker resistent hardware for the U.S. military, the sale of 3-COM to Huawei and Bain Entreprises has raised security concerns in the halls of Congress. While others will raise these legitimate concerns, I am interested in another aspect of this buy-out: the spread of state-capitalism.<br />For starters, note that a two American global investment firms have interest in this sale. The first is clearly Bain Capital; the second is Goldman Sachs, sole advisor to 3-Com.<br />Huawei and 3-Com have been closely connected for some time. 3-Com was attracted to Huawei because of its access to significant cash, its dedicated labor force, and its six-to-one advantage in terms of labor cost, all elements that have attracted companies to China. In fact, only a year ago, 3-Com&#8217;s CEO talked of <a href="http://www.cio.com.au/index.php/id;1131730556;fp;;fpid;;pf;1">acquiring</a> its &#8220;junior&#8221; partner. How things do change. Who is swallowing whom here?<br />What is Huawei? On the surface it seems to be a privately run 16-year old company, owned by one of the wealthiest men in China. But everything may not be as it seems. Consider the following from <a href="http://www.dmf.go.th/events/news.show_news_eng.asp?id=6414"> China Economic Quarterly</a> and appearing also in <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0a83f662-07b8-11da-a742-00000e2511c8.html?nclick_check=1">Financial Times</a>, an article probing the relationship between Chinese corporations and China itself:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>A third level of state influence is visible in Huawei, a maker of telecoms network equipment. Huawei is ostensibly privately-owned, although many of its shares are owned by the local state telecoms authorities to which it has sold equipment. It enjoys a US$10bn low-interest credit line from the China Development Bank, whose mission is to make concessional loans in support of state policy goals. Huawei’s ties to China’s military have long been the subject of speculation. For the most part, Huawei seems to act independently. Yet, so much about the firm’s parentage is obscure that one can never be entirely sure.<br />The complexity and murkiness of state-corporate relations in China lends a foundation of legitimacy to the political outcry over Chinese takeovers of foreign firms. At one level, this outcry is silly. It could never really hurt developed countries to sell off mid-sized energy companies and floundering appliance makers to Chinese buyers willing to pay rich prices. There is almost certainly an element of racism in protesting sales to Chinese state firms, when similar sales to French state firms would pass unnoticed.<br />But at a deeper level, these objections reflect a simple truth. It is almost impossible to ascertain the extent to which a Chinese state firms is an autonomous actor or an agent of state policy. The Chinese state is controlled by a secretive and authoritarian organisation whose aims are neither clear nor open to scrutiny and debate. When you sell to a Chinese state firm, you ultimately have no idea who you are really selling to. This creates a fair case for raising your asking price, or deciding to sell to a more trustworthy buyer.</p></blockquote>
<p>The racism issue does not interest me, nor do I wish to address the security issue. Others, I am sure, will do both. What I find of interest is the way globalization is proceeding.<br />In the past, global companies, with the help of the World Bank and the IMF, have entered third-world companies, burdened with debt. When the loan was made, one of the conditions was that these countries had to sell their floundering&#8211;and sometimes not so floundering, state owned corporations. Often an ancillliary condition was that the country devalue its currency, which meant pegging it to the dollar. (Do you hear the echo here?) Additionally. many of these countries were brutally dictatorial, Chile under Pinochet, for example. (More echoes?)The reach and power of multinationals was enhanced through the IMF.<br />Additionally, the WTO set the rules for globalization that did not put any restrictions on how a country used or abused its labor force, an additional plum for multinationals.<br />(As an aside, it is no wonder that the IMF now languishes, relegated to being almost a reportorial institution. Third world countries have learned their lesson. Again, it is no wonder that WTO negotiations have stalled. Again, third world countries who care about their people are learning the lesson.)</p>
<p>But along comes China, a repressive dictatorial regime, with more than one-fifth of the world&#8217;s population, a huge, hardworking, labor force with absolutely no protection, centrally controlled. What more could a multinational ask for? Really? Privatization has never blinked before dictatorial regimes; in fact, they rather enjoy them. China was to be the ultimate plum.<br />But deeper than issues of control, what about state-sponsored capitalism? What happens when a country has a gigantic, poor, hard-working labor force and is willing to put that labor force at the disposal of multinationals? Who will eat whom in the end? I suspect that neo-conservative, now gushing over China as the next gigantic prize, will soon learn that China is more than it can swallow. The marriage of 3-Com and Huawei was no accident. China wants to control the internet.<br />3-Com, lured by cheap labor and which, only a year ago, thought it would buy-out Huawei and thereby control the Chinese and world market, may now be swallowed. Who&#8217;s next?<br />Thank you Goldman and Bain for making all this possible. Thanks also to our redoubtable Secretary of State, Henry Paulsen. Thanks also to all those economists who so love free markets and deregulation&#8211;free for corporation but shackling to labor&#8211;that they have made all this possible.</p>

                                <p>Lifted from comments on trolls:</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t think there are any real &#8220;trolls&#8221; at this site. Trolls are malicious and their only intent is to sabotage websites. They might post hundreds of irrelevant posts with the only purpose of discouraging people from visiting that site.</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;m more interested in how a discussion might influence a neutral third party who happens to &#8220;eavesdrop.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always thought that troll tactics always fail when judged by that test. Most people see through that kind of thing.</p>
<p>When somebody simply negates the interlocutor&#8217;s position and reiterates this until the other sides gives up responding, that&#8217;s perhaps &#8220;winning the argument&#8221; technically, but it&#8217;s not a discussion.</p>
<p>I think the summary of what defines a troll is pretty much (attempts of) derailing the discourse by a variety of tactics, including diversion, noise, and &#8220;draining&#8221; energy by engaging others in fruitless arguments, if need be repeatedly.</p>
<p>Treat trolls like cockroaches. Do as much as you can to squish the ones who pop up often, but don&#8217;t be surprised when another turns up later.</p>
<p>-like an itch they are hard to ignore, but made worse by scratching.i don&#8217;t believe the &#8220;highly intelligent&#8221; or exactly the &#8220;agenda&#8221; thing&#8230;because while their positions are predictable and seem to fit some political groups talking points, there logic runs from bad</p>

Davis is the former chief prosecutor for the Office of Military Commissions</a>. The opinions expressed are his own and do not represent the views of the Department of Defense or the Department of the Air Force.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Military Commissions Act provides a foundation for fair trials, but some changes are clearly necessary. I was confident in full, fair and open trials when Gen. Altenburg was the convening authority and Brig. Gen. Tom Hemingway was his legal advisor. Collectively, they spent nearly 65 years in active duty, and they were committed to ensuring the integrity of military law. They acted on principle rather than politics. The first step, if these truly are military commissions and not merely a political smoke screen, is to take control out of the hands of political appointees like Haynes and Crawford and give it back to the military. The president first authorized military commissions in November 2001, more than six years ago, and the lack of progress is obvious. Only one war-crime case has been completed. It is time for the political appointees who created this quagmire to let go. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham have said that how we treat the enemy says more about us than it does about him. If we want these military commissions to say anything good about us, it&#8217;s time to take the politics out of military commissions, give the military control over the process and make the proceedings open and transparent.</p></blockquote>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Earlier today <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/liberal-fascism.html">I noted</a> that, from what I can tell Jonah Goldberg&#8217;s book, Liberal Fascism, is intended to make the term fascist meaningless, the same way Reagan <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z3.xls">made the term fiscally responsible meaningless</a>.  I admit to not having read the book &#8211; merely a review that was pretty fawning and that seems to have pleased Goldberg.</p>
<p>But still, I was thinking where Goldberg could go from here&#8230; and the idea of sequel came to me:  Progressive Conservativism, wherein Goldberg could argue that conservatives are the true progressives.  I won&#8217;t bother to flesh it out, but here are some points he could use as notes:</p>
<p>1.  On the economy, the theme for conservatives is Schumpeter&#8217;s creative destruction.  That&#8217;s all about progress, as opposed to keeping things as they are.  And they don&#8217;t want to do it the old-fashioned way Adam Smith described.  Nope, if the big boys get in trouble, they deserve a bail out.  Even the method of promoting progress progresses!</p>
<p>2.  Conservatives like the military but don&#8217;t like taxes.  When you think about the ramification of these two facts, they want to try an experiment (i.e., progress!) &#8211; what happens when you create a large, heavily armed organization and don&#8217;t raise enough money to pay them?  (I think most conservatives ignore the fact that this experiment has actually been tried before, and the outcome is always the same.)</p>
<p>3.  Conservatives aren&#8217;t fond of environmental rules and regulations.  What could be more in line with rejecting the past than looking to a future where nature itself is completely transformed from what it was in the past?  Pump enough garbage into the air and we&#8217;ll learn to eat lead and breathe sulphur and like it.  At least those of us who choose to do so will.    Those who reject progress will not.  And that will also be progress.</p>
<p>4.  And then there&#8217;s science.  Conservatives not only want progress in science, they want science itself to undergo progress for once.  Since Galileo showed up, science has consisted of observation, formulation of hypotheses, testing, and evaluation of hypotheses.  But conservatives have introduced a streamlined approach, applicable to biology, atmospheric sciences, and pretty much everything else:  say it and make it so (or, as in the parlance of the current Presidential administration, creating its own reality).  Keep the naysayers quiet and what&#8217;s left can only be the truth.  That is progress.  (Of course, this one has been tried in the past too, but apparently things come around.) </p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s what I got for now, but I figure its a good start. Progressive Conservativism by Jonah Goldberg &#8211; look for it on bookstore shelves in a few years.</p>

<p>Does not look good.  I&#8217;m starting to have doubts about my forecast that we are just sliding into a stagnation, not a recession scenario.  The household survey look especially worrisome.</p>

December hours worked were unchanged.  The 4th quarter hours worked data is up at a 1.1% rate, about the same as the third quarter. It still implies that the second and third quarter rebound in productivity growth is probably continuing.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R3-nTca1zGI/AAAAAAAAAEU/FtM5392QUo4/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R3-nTca1zGI/AAAAAAAAAEU/FtM5392QUo4/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The new factor is weakness in finance.  Employment growth in that sector just turned negative<br />and it will almost certainly remain negative for some time.</p>

But finance is a high wage area &#8212; average hourly earnings in fiance is $19.89 as compared to $17.66 for total private average hourly earnings. This has negative consequences for income and spending growth.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I was reading <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/68954?page_no=1">this review</a> of Jonah Goldberg&#8217;s upcoming tome, Liberal Fascists.  Its very complementary.  I haven&#8217;t read the book &#8211; I don&#8217;t think its come out yet, and its not like anyone has sent me a complementary copy.  </p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll rely on reviews.  And a complementary review &#8211; one that gets mentioned as such <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTMyM2M0MzFiOGEzMjVmMDAzMjE0N2NhNmI3YWI2NGM=">by Goldberg himself</a>, is presumably a fair place to start.</p>
<p>What Goldberg is arguing is evident from the title of his book &#8211; the true fascists are liberals.  But he goes further than that&#8230;  the Nazi is short for National Socialist, and Benito Mussolini considered himself a socialist.  (As an aside&#8230; the folks who buy into this argument have a conniption when its pointed out that Hitler considered himself a Christian rather than the atheist they make him out to be.)  And of course, here in the US, FDR is the obvious example of liberal fascism.</p>
<p>But that then raises the obvious issue&#8230;  if everyone from Stalin to Mussolini was a fascist, who exactly wasn&#8217;t?  The monarchists, who felt the state, through the king and nobility should call all the shots?  How very unfascist.  Perhaps the industrialists and captains of industry &#8211; but didn&#8217;t Hitler&#8217;s Germany and Mussolini&#8217;s Italy, to name the two most prominent examples of fascism (even by Goldberg&#8217;s argument, presumably) have a &#8220;big corporations working with the state&#8221; type policy?  What European movements of the 1920s to the 1940s, to name a prominent period, can&#8217;t be &#8220;shown&#8221; to be fascist by Goldberg&#8217;s definition?  </p>
<p>But maybe its just Europe.  Buncha damn foreigners anyway.  Here in the US, no doubt, we have some good Americans.  Not fascists.  Now, since FDR is a big fascist, clearly we&#8217;re talking people who opposed FDR.  Could it be Hoover &#8211; who &#8220;repatriated&#8221; (i.e., expelled) American citizens of Mexican descent?  (Doesn&#8217;t that sound suspiciously like the Volk thing the Nazis were spewing, coupled with Mussolini&#8217;s profound nationalism?)  The America First people who opposed  war with Germany and saw it as Jewish plot? </p>
<p>So to repeat&#8230;  is there any movement of any size in Europe or the US in the 1920s to 1940s, on the left or the right, that cannot be described as fascist using Goldberg&#8217;s definition?    The best I could come up with:  some of the libertarians, most of the anarchists, and a good percent of the residents of mental institutions.  My bet is that if I think long enough, I could come up with reasons why, under Goldbergian logic, they&#8217;d be considered fascist too&#8230;</p>
<p>And perhaps that&#8217;s the point&#8230;. the reviews ends with this, which Goldberg highlights when linking to it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are all fascists now,&#8221; he concludes. Disagree if you must, but go out and read this brilliant, insightful, and important book.</p></blockquote>
<p>When a term applies to everything, it means nothing.  And Goldberg&#8217;s goal, apparently, is to make the term fascism become meaningless.  And why not?  After all, the movement he is a part of has already pulled that stunt off with the term &#8220;Fiscal Responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update&#8230; Edited the conclusion marginally.</p>

<blockquote><p>Teaching children the art of collaborative philosophical inquiry brings them persistent, long-term cognitive benefits, according to psychologists in Scotland.</p>
<p>Keith Topping and Steve Trickey first reported the short-term benefits of using <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/books?id=XEMVAAAACAAJ">Thinking through Philosophy&#8221;</a> with children in an earlier study.</p>
<p>One hundred and five children in the penultimate year of primary school (aged approximately ten years) were given one hour per week of philosophical-inquiry based lessons for 16 months. Compared with 72 control children, the philosophy children showed significant improvements on tests of their verbal, numerical and spatial abilities at the end of the 16-month period relative to their baseline performance before the study.</p>
<p>Now Topping and Trickey have tested the cognitive abilities of the children two years after that earlier study finished, by which time the children were nearly at the end of their second year of secondary school. The children hadn&#8217;t had any further philosophy-based lessons but the benefits of their early experience of philosophy persisted. The 71 philosophy-taught children who the researchers were able to track down showed the same cognitive test scores as they had done two years earlier. By contrast, 44 control children actually showed a trend towards a deterioration in their inferior scores from two years earlier.</p>
<p>The philosophy-based lessons encouraged a community approach to &#8216;inquiry&#8217; in the classroom, with children sharing their views on Socratic questions posed by the teacher. The children&#8217;s cognitive abilities were tested using the &#8216;Cognitive Abilities Test&#8217;, a measure which has been found to predict children&#8217;s performance on external school examinations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Follow-up studies of thinking skills interventions are very rare in the literature, so this finding is an important contribution,&#8221; the researchers said.<br />_________________________________</p>
<p>Topping, K.J. &#038; Trickey, S. (2007). <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpsoc/bjep/2007/00000077/00000004/art00003">Collaborative philosophical inquiry for school-children: Cognitive gains at 2-year follow-up.</a> British Journal of Educational Psychology, 77, 787-796.</p></blockquote>
<p>In MA upwards of three weeks of time can be directly devoted to taking the MCAS exams each year as part of measuring a school systems performance and improvements. It has turned into a high stakes game of competition to prove superiority among school systems, especially affecting real estate values. The exams are also used to measure individual achievement by parents at times, but are not designed to do this.</p>
<p>One of the teachers for my kids in elementary school in second grade was superb, but recieved only respect with no monetary compensation for her excellence. Her flair for innovation and individualization was grounded in solid andd well thought out curriculums. After &#8216;retiring&#8217; she made the cover of Time Magazine as Teacher of the Year for her efforts in mentoring teachers.</p>
<p>There are countless examples of such behavior, and requires a lot of extra time to maintain. Some today that I am familiar with maintain private blogs with exciting content and presentation, but there is no way to compensate them in general.<br />Others simply put in a lot of time after school in such things as debate, theater, choral music.</p>
<p>Baseline testing is a valid activity, but does seem to be overblown as a way of educating kids. Baseline testing needs some sort of perspective placed upon the incentive structure. What is our goal?</p>

<div>We noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/december-employment-report-even-worse.html">earlier</a> the discussion from <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/01/04/which-is-the-bigger-risk-recession-or-inflation">Greg Ip</a>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The Fed pays more attention to core inflation, which is less volatile because it excludes food and energy. But that picture is also troubling. Since April 2004, core inflation measured by the Fed’s preferred price index has been at or above the top of policy makers’ preferred 1.5% to 2% for all but five months, notes Doug Elmendorf, a former Fed economist who is now a scholar at the Brookings Institution. It dipped in the spring of last year before edging higher by year end. The Fed, by allowing inflation to consistently run higher than its preferred range, risks feeding higher expectations of inflation in the public, which will make it harder to get inflation back down, Mr. Elmendorf noted. Mr. Bernanke, whose term is up for renewal in 2010, certainly wants to avoid a recession. But he would probably prefer a mild recession now to a high risk of increased inflation and a deeper recession later.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Greg was noting a possible short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment, <a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/JubaksJournal/Is70sStyleStagflationComing.aspx">Jim Jubak</a> fears stagflation:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Stagflation is coming. Lock up your portfolio. We could be on our way to a replay of the 1970s … In the United States, headline inflation started off the decade at 5.5% in 1970, peaked at 12.2% in 1974 and again at 13.3% in 1979, and didn&#8217;t drop below 4% until 1982. For the &#8217;70s as a whole, inflation averaged 7.4% annually. In comparison, inflation in the 1960s averaged 2.5% annually.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me explain why I don’t have inflation hysteria by providing a graph of the difference between the nominal rate on 5-year Federal bonds versus the real interest rate as given for the 5-year Treasury Inflation Indexed Notes. The difference, which is often taken as the market’s expectation of inflation, has floated around an average of only 2.17 percent since January 2004. Our graph also shows a general tendency for both nominal and real interest rates to have risen during the 2004 to 2006 period when the economy was getting closer to full employment. As the labor market showed signs of weakness during 2007, the Federal Reserve did allow the nominal rate to decline, which also led to lower real interest rates. Whether this easier money can allow us to avoid a recession is a difficult question. But for those who are hysterical over renewed inflation, might I suggest you relax and actually look at the real world data. Jubak’s claim that we are about to see the inflation ratios of the 1970’s is a real stretch. </div>
