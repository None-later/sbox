                                <p>I&#8217;m going to play Devil&#8217;s Advocate to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/jmohr-on-legal-status-of-enemy.html">JMOHR</a>, where he notes that as signatory to the Geneva and other conventions, we are bound to provide a minimum level of treatment to anyone captured as part of the War on Terror.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m no historian, but my understanding is that during the Franco-Prussian War, the German military was quite open about shooting large number of civilians in occupied territory as a demonstration intended to keep resistance to a minimum, particularly after Sedan.  In World War 1, the German military was quite open about shooting large numbers of civilians in occupied territory as a demonstration intended to keep resistance to a minimum.  In the first weeks of the war, for example, the Germans massacred somewhere between a hundred and two hundred civilians in Andenne, Belgium&#8230; and then put up placards in other occupied Belgian towns to inform residents of the peril of failing to fully cooperate fully.  In World War 2, the German military was quite open about shooting large numbers of civilians in occupied territory as a demonstration intended to keep resistance to a minimum.  My grandfather used to have a poster &#8220;commemorating&#8221; the massacre at Lidice.  </p>
<p>Some thoughts&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  The policies of brutal, often collective punishment did not stop civilian resistance in any of the three wars<br />2.  On the other hand, arguably brutal, collective punishment stopped the Germans from launching another war.  The fire bombing of Dresden and the post-War occupation of East Germany, not to mention the large number of German soldiers and civilians who perished in Soviet work camps, helped provide strong disincentive to the Germans to involvement in another war.  <br />3.  As per 1 and 2, is it possible (game-theory wise) that the failure of brutal and collective punishment came because it wasn&#8217;t brutal and collective enough to accomplish that goal?</p>
<p>I note&#8230; I personally do not feel that behaving barbarically is a good idea &#8211; even if it works to quell resistance, it does something to those who engage in the behavior.   At least that&#8217;s what I think&#8230; but I&#8217;ll play devil&#8217;s advocate to that too&#8230;  my grandfather &#8211; who went on a one year all expenses paid tour of Western Europe from the middle of 1944 to the middle of 1945 told me that after the Battle of the Bulge, when it was found that several SS units had engaged in the practice of simply shooting American prisoners, word came down from the top that Patton himself would personally take an unfriendly interest in any soldier in the Third Army who knowingly brought in a prisoner from any of those units.  Treatment of civilians and prisoners from other units of the German military and the SS, from what I was told, continued to be by the book, and Patton wouldn&#8217;t have had it otherwise.  Every few years until he died, my grandfather continued to go to his battalion reunions.  As years went by, there were fewer and fewer of the former soldiers, and more and more family members.  I never went to his reunions, but my aunt did, and she tells me that the men who carried out Patton&#8217;s directives remained, to the end, very good men.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Hoisted from comments just like DeLong does&#8230;</p>
<p>Reader JMOHR describes his background thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;juris doctor from Indiana University. I did assist a professor for several years in researching and writing a book on the history of Military Justice in the United States. I was a judge advocate for five years in the active military and an additional five years in the reserves. I have been trained specifically in the Law of War. It was one of my duties to train active duty and reserve officers in the Law of War.</p></blockquote>
<p>He goes on to state:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, you have to understand the meaning of the term POW. A simple definition that has been observed through prior wars states:</p>
<p>The captured service member must have conducted operations according to the laws and customs of war: be part of a chain of command and wear a uniform and bear arms openly.</p>
<p>Article 2 makes it clear that we, as a party to the convention are bound by its requirements even though our enemy has not become a signatory:</p>
<p>Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.</p>
<p>Afghanistan was so bound. Taliban and associated AQ fighters would also be covered.</p>
<p>FA bases his argument that POW&#8217;s may be detained for the duration of the conflict further means that other requirements of the Convention apply that are clearly being violated by the United States. Aggressive interrogation to produce confessions which the US asserts can be used to convict detainees for terrorist activities would be prohibited:</p>
<p>Article 17</p>
<p>No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be<br />threatened, insulted, or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.</p>
<p>Indeed, the conventions deal specifically with coerced confessions:</p>
<p>Article 99</p>
<p>No moral or physical coercion may be exerted on a prisoner of war in order to induce him to admit himself guilty of the act of which he is accused.</p>
<p>Additionally, POW status provides that the detainee would have the same rights as a US military member:</p>
<p>Article 102</p>
<p>A prisoner of war can be validly sentenced only if the sentence has been pronounced by the same courts according to the same procedure as in the case of members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power, and if, furthermore, the provisions of the present Chapter have been observed.</p>
<p>Another issue arises with detaining and trying persons for merely being associated with a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; organization:</p>
<p>Convention IV</p>
<p>Art. 33. No protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited.</p>
<p>Look, FA is an idiot. He cannot call for the detention of the GTMO detainees for an indefinite basis and deny them the kinds of protections afforded by the conventions.</p>
<p>FA &#8211; civilians accused of crimes fall under a separate convention. The rights of a power to detain such individuals are greatly restricted from those that are permitted for POW&#8217;s. We will probably end up in an extended discussion of the use of domestic law and courts for those crimes. I tend to agree with Professor Jinks that no person falls outside of the protection of the conventions.</p>
<p>Oh, the right to habeus corpus is not restricted to US citizens. One case addressed the application of the doctrine to persons detained outside of the United States after WWII. The court based its decision to deny habeus on the fact that those seeking relief could have gone to the courts of the country in which they were detained. I have some real questions as to how possible it would have been. However, the Cuban government exercises no jurisdiction over GTMO.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Glance at the more or less healthy stock markets in New York, London, and Frankfurt, and you might never know that this debate is raging. Hopes that Middle Eastern and Asian wealth funds will plug every hole lifts spirits.<br />Glance at the debt markets and you hear a different tale. Not a single junk bond has been issued in Europe since August. Every attempt failed.<br />Europe&#8217;s corporate bond issuance fell 66pc in the third quarter to $396bn (BIS data). Emerging market bonds plummeted 75pc.<br />&#8220;The kind of upheaval observed in the international money markets over the past few months has never been witnessed in history,&#8221; says Thomas Jordan, a Swiss central bank governor.<br />&#8220;The sub-prime mortgage crisis hit a vital nerve of the international financial system,&#8221; he says.<br />The market for asset-backed commercial paper &#8211; where Europe&#8217;s lenders from IKB to the German Doctors and Dentists borrowed through Irish-based &#8220;conduits&#8221; to play US housing debt &#8211; has shrunk for 18 weeks in a row. It has shed $404bn or 36pc. As lenders refuse to roll over credit, banks must take these wrecks back on their books. There lies the rub.<br />Professor Spencer says capital ratios have fallen far below the 8 per cent minimum under Basel rules. &#8220;If they can&#8217;t raise capital, they will have to shrink balance sheets,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sinclair Lewis wrote a book with the ironic title <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cant-Happen-Here-Sinclair-Lewis/dp/0451525825" rel="nofollow">It Can&#8217;t Happen Here</a>. (hat tip to Bruce Webb from comments <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/corev-on-senates-recess.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>There is a strain of thought in American politics that prefers to consider the Constitution as an impediment. Another example comes to mind from this new information about a man with a familiar name, and it is not Prescott Bush.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/washington/23habeas.html?_r=2&#038;hp=&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;oref=slogin&#038;adxnnlx=1198357995-MOByPUP6pwKvuSdCGHZS1A&#038;oref=slogin">The NYT</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>A newly declassified document shows that J. Edgar Hoover, the longtime director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had a plan to suspend habeas corpus and imprison some 12,000 Americans he suspected of disloyalty.</p>
<p>Hoover sent his plan to the White House on July 7, 1950, 12 days after the Korean War began. It envisioned putting suspect Americans in military prisons.</p>
<p>Hoover wanted President Harry S. Truman to proclaim the mass arrests necessary to “protect the country against treason, espionage and sabotage.” The F.B.I would “apprehend all individuals potentially dangerous” to national security, Hoover’s proposal said. The arrests would be carried out under “a master warrant attached to a list of names” provided by the bureau.</p>
<p>The names were part of an index that Hoover had been compiling for years. “The index now contains approximately twelve thousand individuals, of which approximately ninety-seven per cent are citizens of the United States,” he wrote.</p>
<p>“In order to make effective these apprehensions, the proclamation suspends the Writ of Habeas Corpus,” it said.</p>
<p>Habeas corpus, the right to seek relief from illegal detention, has been a fundamental principle of law for seven centuries. The Bush administration’s decision to hold suspects for years at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, has made habeas corpus a contentious issue for Congress and the Supreme Court today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some have argued that habeaus corpus can be suspended for a certain category of prisoner, with no effort to establish the accuracy of the charges, even if one can find out what the charge is. JAG has come under heavy pressure to relent on insistence for using military or civilian rules instead of a nebulous indefinite confinement.<br />Rule of law trumps convenience in my mind, and is the patriots duty to defend.</p>

<blockquote><p>China&#8217;s intelligence service gained access to a secret National Security Agency listening post in Hawaii through a Chinese-language translation service, according to U.S. intelligence officials.<br />The spy penetration was discovered several years ago as part of a major counterintelligence probe by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) that revealed an extensive program by China&#8217;s spy service to steal codes and other electronic intelligence secrets, and to recruit military and civilian personnel with access to them.</p>
<p>According to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, China&#8217;s Ministry of State Security, the main civilian spy service, carried out the operations by setting up a Chinese translation service in Hawaii that represented itself as a U.S.-origin company.</p>
<p>The ruse led to classified contracts with the Navy and NSA to translate some of the hundreds of thousands of intercepted communications gathered by NSA&#8217;s network of listening posts, aircraft and ships.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Naval intelligence officials familiar with the Chinese spy penetration said the access to both &#8220;raw&#8221; and analyzed intelligence at Kunia caused significant damage by giving China&#8217;s government details on both the targets and the sources of U.S. spying operations. Such information would permit the Chinese to block the eavesdropping or to provide false and misleading &#8220;disinformation&#8221; to U.S. intelligence.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Let me update my post from this morning on social mobility, and suggest a number of scenarios.  How comfortable are you living in each of these?</p>
<p>1.  Each person&#8217;s position in society is determined entirely by their parentage.  The first child of the monarch is the next monarch (second and third children are princes), the first children of other aristocracy inherit their parent&#8217;s title, land, etc.  All land is owned by the aristocracy.  At the bottom, the child of a soldier is a soldier, the child of a carpenter, etc.  No (first child) ends up wealthier or less wealthy than his/her parents were before.  No second or child (among the nobility) ends up as wealthy as the first child.  Nobody born into the aristocracy fails to obtain a position of privilege relative to the masses, and nobody born among the masses manages to get into a position of privilege similar to that of the aristocracy.</p>
<p>2.  The same situation as 1, but 5% of children end up 10% wealthier or less wealthy than their parents.  Among the aristocracy, a small number of second and third children end up doing better off than first children.</p>
<p>3.  The same situation as 2, but some of the more successful non-aristocrats are able to receive an aristocratic title.  Some of the less successful aristocrats (whether by virtue of poor decision making or as a result of being born second or third or fourth children) are kicked out of the aristocracy.</p>
<p>4.  The same situation as 3, but with twice as much mobility</p>
<p>5.  Complete churning of the aristocracy and hoi polloi &#8211; where a person ends up has nothing to do with where they started.</p>
<p>After you determine your comfort level with each of these, two more questions: </p>
<p>A.  Which of these scenarios do you feel is the best approximation for the system we observe around us?<br />B.  What would it take to get closer to the system you&#8217;d most like to see?</p>

<p>Captain Ed, of <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/016395.php?disqus_reply=44231#comment-44231">Captains  Quarters,</a> has an interesting analysis of options for President Bush in this budget kerfuffle.  We have two situations that could be  improved by simple counter moves.</p>
<p>1)  The Senate is still in session (in order to block any Bush recess appointments).  If the Republicans were smart, they would send in somebody to demand a quorum call, forcing a recess if it were to fail.  How could it not fail?  Nearly all senators, Democratic and Republican, would be forced to return.  None would be happy, and few would actually return.  Of course ramifications for the future could be less than perfect for the President.</p>
<p>2)Congress has passed an Omnibus Spending Bill but it is loaded with earmarks.<br />
<blockquote>The omnibus spending bill made its way down Pennsylvania Avenue this week, and it could have slid all the way down on the grease it contains from over 9,000 earmarks.</p></blockquote>
<p>The President has requested his staff to review ways to eliminate wasteful spending as  represented by the 9,000+ earmarks included in this bill, and there  may be a simple way.  Issue an Executive Order eliminating spending for  earmarks included the conference reports, but not in the actual  legislation.  Conference Reports are attached after a law is passed, and are not voted upon.</p>
<p>This would have the effect of implementing the announced but not followed Democratic Policy of reducing and accounting for the number of earmarks.<br />
<blockquote>Congress can blame itself for leaving this loophole, and it stems from their eagerness to airdrop earmarks rather than account for them as promised. Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid passed reform  rules that supposedly barred earmarks in conference reports. However, 90%  of the earmarks in the omnibus bill never entered the legislative  language, making a mockery of their claims to reform.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brian Reidl of the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Budget/wm1757.cfm">Heritage Foundation</a> has an explanation of the President&#8217;s option.<br />
<blockquote>Most earmarks are not written into the actual appropriations bills that are  signed into law. Rather, they are included in conference reports, which are  explanatory statements that accompany the legislation to the  President&#8217;s desk. Because they are not technically part of the bill, the  Executive Branch is not legally bound to implement conference<br /> reports.</p></blockquote>
<p>  In reality, it would represent a form of line item veto,  which could be wielded by this and future presidents.  In the short run it<br /> certainly would make earmark legislation much more transparent.</p>

                                <p>Most of us don&#8217;t buy the Divine Right of Kings.  Sure, its cute that assorted countries from Europe to Asia have inbred-to-the-degree-of-being-funny-looking hereditary monarchs and nobility, but we like to believe that success is largely a factor of our own abilities.  In our society, its OK that some people inherit vast sums and others inherit nothing because the societal mythology is that unworthy people who inherit vast sums regularly end up with nothing, and people who inherit nothing regularly end up at the top of the heap.</p>
<p>But&#8230;  what is the minimum acceptable amount of social mobility for us to conclude we live in a world where who your family is trumps the rules of capitalism?  How do we measure that point and assure ourselves we&#8217;re past it?  And bear in mind &#8211; even in a feudal society, social mobility was possible &#8211; a peasant who saved the life of a king could become nobility, and a noble who insulted the king could find his family stripped of land and title.</p>
<p>But before you answer&#8230; not that <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/12/most_be_a_gene_transplantation.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> links to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/12/20/orphanage.brain.ap/index.html">this article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the study, U.S. researchers randomly assigned 136 young children in Bucharest&#8217;s six orphanages to either keep living there or live with foster parents who were specially trained and paid for by the study. Romania had no foster-care system in 2000 when the research began.</p>
<p>The team chose apparently healthy children. Researchers repeatedly tested brain development as those children grew, and tracked those who ultimately were adopted or reunited with family. For comparison, they also tested the cognitive ability of children who never were institutionalized.</p>
<p>By 4½, youngsters in foster care were scoring almost 10 points higher on IQ tests than the children left in orphanages. Children who left the orphanages before 2 saw an almost 15-point increase.</p>
<p>Nelson compared the ages at which children were sent to foster care. For every extra month spent in the orphanage, up to almost age 3, it meant roughly a half-point lower score on those later IQ tests.</p>
<p>Children raised in their biological homes still fared best, with average test scores 10 points to 20 points higher than the foster-care kids.</p></blockquote>
<p>So&#8230; to repeat my questions&#8230; what is the minimum acceptable amount of social mobility for us to conclude we live in a world where who your family is trumps the rules of capitalism?  How do we measure that point and assure ourselves we&#8217;re past it?</p>
<p>&#8212; </p>
<p>Update.  Minor changes to phrasing of the first question.</p>

That makes the relatively small amount awarded Friday, $21 million, something of a setback for Antigua, which had been struggling to preserve its gambling industry.<br />The United States argued that its behavior had caused $500,000 damage.<br /><strong>&#8230;<br /></strong>Yet the ruling is significant in that it grants a rare form of compensation: the right of one country, in this case Antigua, to violate intellectual property laws of another — the United States — by allowing it to distribute copies of American music, movie and software products.<br />In May, the United States said it was rewriting its trade rules to remove gambling from the jurisdiction of the W.T.O.<br />Washington has agreed on deals with the <a title="More articles about the European Union." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org">European Union</a>, Canada and Japan to change the treaty but not with several other nations, including Antigua.<br />On Friday, the United States trade representative issued a stern warning to Antigua to avoid acts of piracy, counterfeiting or violations of intellectual property rights while talks continue.<br />The trade office said such behavior would “undermine Antigua’s claimed intentions of becoming a leader in legitimate electronic commerce, and would severely discourage foreign investment” in the country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has been a lot of discussion on blogs about the ramifications of the rulings:<br />1. The potential impact (or not) on sovereignty over restrictions on trade for &#8216;moral&#8217; concerns.<br />2. The impact on the status of local and state law as regards &#8216;national treatment&#8217;.<br />3. How sanctions could be implemented in a workable manner.</p>
<p>There are far bigger concerns in other trade areas, but the EU is watching closely as well.</p>

<blockquote><p>Six years ago, the first prisoners from the war against terrorism arrived at the U.S. military detention center at Guantánamo Bay. The Bush administration refused to grant prisoner-of-war status to inmates there and denied them the protections of the Geneva Conventions, and has brought criminal charges against only three of them. In this ignoble chapter in the history of U.S. justice, the American military&#8217;s own uniformed lawyers have stood out for their attempts to uphold the rule of law.<br />That may not be true for long. To clip the wings of the Judge Advocate General corps, <strong>the administration recently proposed to give politically appointed lawyers in the Defense Department a veto over JAG officers&#8217; promotions</strong>. When military lawyers objected to this gambit, the administration backed off. But it is still looking for a way to expand its authority over military lawyers.<br />The administration&#8217;s gambit came after JAG officers testified last year against the administration&#8217;s proposal, enacted by Congress, for kangaroo-court tribunal procedures for Guantánamo inmates charged with crimes. JAG<br />lawyers called for trying the prisoners either under military rules or in federal courts.</p></blockquote>
<p>We shall be having political appointees in every corner of the government. Even in the military?</p>
