                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/004517.html">Jesse Taylor</a> and many other wise bloggers comes a roar of laughter at the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200501250808.asp">Donald Luskin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Doing this may have toned down that big, bad $10.4 trillion number by setting it against a big, good $295.5 trillion number. But this is misleading, too, in its own way. If payrolls are $295.5 trillion and the deficit is $10.4 trillion, that means Social Security’s anticipated payments to the infinite-horizon must, by definition, be $305.9 trillion — which is a really big, bad number.</p></blockquote>
<p>As others have noted, this $295.5 trillion represents the payroll tax BASE.  I guess Mr. Luskin either thinks the tax rate is 100% or is proposing a massive increase from the current rate of only 12.4%.  I thought he said he was against tax increases?  </p>
<p>Of course, Luskin might object that he knows this figure represents the tax base and not tax receipts, but since his oped was complaining about others allegedly misleading the public, why is he trying to mislead his readers?  </p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Luskin also writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want context — so that the public is sure not to be misled — then how about this? That $10.4 trillion number represents the value of economic assets today that would have to be contributed to the Social Security system to assure its perpetual sustainability based on the best estimates we can make at this time. To set things right, then, we would have to contribute today virtually the entire market value of the S&#038;P 500. We would have to throw down the gaping maw of Social Security almost every share of every major company in America today in order to satisfy the hungry beast.</p></blockquote>
<p>Table B.102 of the Federal Reserve’s Flow of Funds reports the assets and the liabilities of Nonfarm Nonfinancial Corporate Business to be $20.9 trillion and $10.2 trillion respectively.  Table B.100 reports the balance sheet for households showing the combined value of corporate equities and mutual fund shares held by households is around $10 trillion.  But as we play this comparison, let’s note that household net worth $46.7 trillion which is about what the present value of the General Fund deficits stack up to be.  But is Luskin crying out that Bush’s fiscal policy is taking the General Fund towards bankrupty? Is he writing that there is some “imminent crisis” here?  </p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Congressman Bill Thomas went on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6853606">Meet the Press</a> to explain that his “dead horse” comment does not mean he opposes Bush’s Social Security deform.  Thomas supports Bush on this issue.  In this interview, there were four odd statements but only three came from Mr. Thomas.  </p>
<p>Thomas’s “dead horse” comment was really a complaint that “the other side” was arguing against Bush’s proposal before it entered “the legislative process”.  Of course, Bush’s minions are making their case based on some gross distortions of this issue.  Is it not fair for our side to counter these dishonest claims?  I guess not.  But we also know the House GOP leadership loves to truncate real debates when the White House does place a proposal into the legislative process.  Thomas did not promise to allow for a vigorous debate on Social Security nor an honest debate.  If he wants to make this promise – that’d be great.</p>
<p>Thomas also argued that the types of ideas used in 1983, such as increasing payroll contributions or deferring the retirement age – cannot be long-term solutions to the “problem”.  Then again, he never really defined what the problem was.  But think about this analogy.  Bob reached the age of 25 in 1985 only to discover his six foot frame had reached 275 pounds.  Bob decided to change his bad eating habits and finally join a gym and exercise.  Fifteen years later, Bob trimmed down to a very healthy 175 pounds.  But with a promotion in 2000 and more job responsibility, Bob has allowed his weight to rise to 190 pounds.  His doctor and his wife are asking him to get back into the gym more and to get back to his prior healthy eating habits.  I guess Thomas thinks this will not work. </p>
<p>The oddest thing Mr. Thomas said had to do with tax policy and employment.  First, he said that past payroll tax increases may not have reduced employment but another tax increase would.  So Russert pressed him on how he would reduce the government deficit.  Income taxes?  No because that would reduce employment.  Then Thomas revealed his real agenda – imposing some form of sales taxes.  I can understand shifting from income taxes to sales taxes to induce more saving, that is, trading off current consumption for future consumption.  But how does increasing sales taxes to cut income taxes induce more employment given that it does not alter the tradeoff between goods and leisure?  </p>
<p>The oddest comment during the interview came from Mr. Russert:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many specific questions about Social Security.  Right now we have a cost-of-living increase, a COLA increase, that is tied more to wages than actual inflation.  It is inaccurate by everyone&#8217;s estimation.  Should that be adjusted in order to be accurate and specifically related to inflation?</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone call <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/">Bob Somerby</a> as Russert has gotten the issue wrong again.  No one is saying increases in nominal wages is a better indicator of the increase in the cost of living than the consumer price index.  But since Mr. Russert is so incredibly behind on his understanding of the Social Security issues, let me suggest that on this score he simply consult <a href="http://thelowestdeep.blogspot.com/2005/01/why-is-re-indexing-so-hard-to.html">this blog</a> for part of his remedial reading.<br /></p>

                                <p>Robert Reich was on CNN trying his best to rebut the disinformation from Steve Forbes as <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0501/23/le.01.html">Wolf Blitzer</a> proved him to be a rather biased referee in the duel.  Forbes kept repeated the 2018 date as if the alleged Social Security crisis was just over a decade away:</p>
<blockquote><p>STEVE FORBES, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think the president gets credit for facing up to the fact that Social Security will be paying out more than it takes in in the next 10 or 12 years. 2018, 2019, the system&#8217;s going to start paying out more money. So why not fix it now when it&#8217;s relatively easy? And as for private accounts, personalized accounts, that means the money&#8217;s invested in the economy, and that guarantees a stronger economy in the future. All you have to do, Wolf, is look at Europe, where they allowed their welfare system to go out of control, and you see they have much lower growth rates than what we should have in the future. So fix it now before it becomes a huge problem 10 or 12 years from now.<br />
<br />BLITZER: Robert Reich, in 1998, your former boss, the president of the United States, at that time Bill Clinton, also spoke about Social Security, his words, as a looming fiscal crisis. Listen precisely to what he said in &#8217;98.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reich properly noted that Clinton was concerned that the Republicans would use the Social Security surpluses to fund General Fund deficits, and later tried to challenge this 2018 date:</p>
<blockquote><p>REICH: Look, first of all, I just want to make sure that those who are listening and heard Steve Forbes &#8212; and I have greatest respect for Steve Forbes &#8212; I want to make sure people understand these numbers without their eyes glazing over. Steve Forbes said in 2018 or 2019 the system is going to run out of money. But remember&#8230;<br />
<br />FORBES: I didn&#8217;t say that. It&#8217;s going to start to pay out more than it takes in.<br />
<br />REICH: But, Steve, it&#8217;s not going to start to pay out more than it takes in.  Remember, right now, the Social Security system has a surplus, a big surplus. But the government is using that surplus to reduce the total deficit. The deficit of $413 billion last year would be much larger if you included all of those &#8212; if you took away all of the surplus.<br />
<br />So it&#8217;s perfectly logical that by 2018 to 2019, when the government, because it used those surpluses on fighting the war in Iraq and everything else, starts to have to deal with the Social Security issue &#8212; but that&#8217;s only because the government has been using those surpluses to do something else. But let me just say our&#8230;<br />
<br />FORBES: The politicians&#8230;<br />
<br />BLITZER: Go ahead, Steve Forbes, respond to that.<br />
<br />FORBES: I was going to say, politicians can&#8217;t help it. It&#8217;s like bears with a pot of honey. They&#8217;re going to go into it. And that&#8217;s why you need private accounts so politicians can&#8217;t put their mitts on the money.<br />
<br />REICH: But the point is that private accounts are going to cost $2 trillion over the next 10 years. You&#8217;re diverting money out of Social Security to set up private accounts.<br />
<br />FORBES: No&#8230;<br />
<br />REICH: Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system. And if you divert $2 trillion over the next 10 years out of Social Security, you&#8217;re not going to fix Social Security, you&#8217;re making it worse.<br />
<br />FORBES: The $2 trillion comes from the public markets. You borrow it, and it&#8217;s paid off in the years after that, like a mortgage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Besides the continual interruptions from Forbes, note his “pot of honey” analogy.  Who were those politicians who wanted to rob our retirement funds?  Oh yea, Mitch Daniels’ “plenty of money for a tax cut” was eyeing this pot of honey.  And Mr. Forbes supported this theft.  </p>
<p>But I suspect Winnie the Pooh is a little too smart for Mr. Forbes.  Could this caller be Pooh Bear himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>CALLER: My question is, would Social Security be in such a crisis, supposedly, had there not been such major tax cuts in the last couple of years?<br />
<br />BLITZER: What about that, Steve Forbes?<br />
<br />FORBES: Not at all. The tax cuts of the last couple of years have made the American economy strong. We have the strongest economy in the developed world today, growing at 3.5, 4 percent. It&#8217;s starting to reduce the budget deficit.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was followed by a rather sad debate over business cycles where Mr. Forbes accented his disinformation with a little profanity.  But business cycles come and go with the economic growth issue being one over savings and investment for long-term growth.  Mr. Forbes should know that the Truman-Eisenhower-Kennedy-Johnson-Nixon-Ford-Carter era of fiscal responsibility had average growth equal to 3.5% per year versus the Reagan-Bush41 record of lower investment and only 3% growth per year.  Average growth under Clinton was 3.7% per year versus 2.5% per year under Bush43.  Yet, neither Blitzer nor Reich called Forbes on his many intellectual fouls.<br /></p>

<br />
<blockquote>During the past few years the US has become dependent, not so much on millions of investors around the globe but on a few individuals in a few of the world&#8217;s central banks.
<p>In 2003, the most recent year with full international statistics, central banks financed 83 per cent of the US current account deficit, with Asian central banks accounting for 86 per cent of flows.</p>
<p>A similar picture is emerging for 2004. &#8230; The People&#8217;s Bank of China has let it be known that China increased dollar reserves by $207bn (€159bn) in 2004, financing nearly a third of the US current account deficit, estimated at $650bn.</p>
<p>Self-interest has supported much of this flow of cash. The US has lapped up cheap finance to fund its unquenchable appetite to spend. Asian governments have until now been keen to oblige, in order to keep their currencies from appreciating. But all investors have their limits and they may start worrying about their degree of exposure.</p>
<p>If new official flows to the US were to be curtailed, the dollar would plunge, creating a huge hole in the accounts of central banks holding dollars.</p>

<blockquote><p>But of course, not all Christians are alike. Many, if not most, Christians understand the true message of Jesus. But there is a frightening number of so-called Christians who can be best described as creepy, rigid, arrogant, cruel, know-it-all, pompous, obnoxious and treacherous &#8211; better known by the acronym C.R.A.C.K.P.O.T.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a Christian, I want to object.  But not to how Michael portrays certain political zealots who abuse the Lord’s name in vain, but rather to being associated with these political zealots.  Of course, the Rovian Republicans will likely saying I’m trying to steal their Bibles – you know the one where the Second Commandment is rewritten to say don’t criticize George W. Bush.<br /></p>

                                <p>Never mind the fact that David Brooks once claimed opponents of the Bush Social Security plan do not trust markets, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/georgewill/gw20050120.shtml">George Will</a> is actually getting praised for the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Voluntary personal accounts will allow competing fund managers, rather than a government monopoly on income transfers from workers to retirees, to allocate a large pool of money. This will enhance the economic dynamism conducive to an open society. Personal accounts will respect individuals&#8217; autonomy and competence, and will narrow the wealth gap by facilitating the accumulation of wealth &#8212; bequeathable wealth &#8212; by persons of modest incomes.  </p>
<p>It used to be the political left that had an exaggerated confidence in the transparency of the future. The left believed &#8212; because Marx had deciphered history&#8217;s unfolding, or because the social sciences had new analytic tools &#8212; that the future had become knowable. Hence government could boldly act, sure of society&#8217;s predictable trajectory. Today some conservatives, beginning their admirable project of Social Security reform, lack the conservative virtue of sobriety about the limits of prophecy. The sober truth is that the philosophic reasons for reforming Social Security are more compelling than the fiscal reasons. </p></blockquote>
<p>The second paragraph strikes me as Donald Rumsfeld poetry with this “knowable” babble.  But Marx?  Pardon me for asking but where is it written that households cannot save already? There is nothing to stop people from putting their income into 401(K) funds – except perhaps a lack of income, which the Bush Social Security plan will not change.  And this bit about a government monopoly versus competing fund managers makes no sense – unless Mr. Will is under some illusion that the Trust Fund has higher administrative expenses than would a privatized system.  So pray tell – what is he talking about?  Maybe those 7% real returns with no risk again?<br /></p>

                                <p>Even Senators Boxer and Kerry are willing to say Dr. Rice is “qualified” to be Secretary of State, which I find amazing in that both Senators have the courage to admit Dr. Rice is dishonest.  But isn’t credibility a key element in the list qualifications for our nation’s chief diplomat?  Which is why I really enjoyed reading <a href="http://www.juancole.com/">Rice Doublespeak at Senate</a> by Juan Cole who also gives the new Secretary of State some very good advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Rice is going to be a successful Secretary of State, she simply has to get back control of US foreign policy from the Likudniks in the Bush administration.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The <em>History Channel </em>will air &#8220;Inside the Presidency&#8221; where they interview both Dick Cheney and Jimmy Carter as well as Gerald Ford.  As I read <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6846348">this story</a>, Cheney seems to be admitting that Bush-Cheney has brought back the Imperial Presidency of Nixon-Agnew.  Three things about what Cheney apparently said.  </p>
<p>First, his notion that the President has the right to invade a nation that is not a threat to us without consultation with Congress or our allies is deeply disturbing.</p>
<p>Second, to claim Iran-Contra to be only “a policy difference” is disingenuous.  </p>
<p>But not as disingenuous as this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bush&#8217;s assertiveness in the early days of his presidency, Cheney said, meant that he was able to respond decisively after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. &#8220;Faced with a whole new threat, set of challenges, you needed a strong, decisive president, and that&#8217;s exactly what we had,&#8221; Cheney said.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the summer of terror (2001), George Bush as President and Dr. Rice as NSA showed a total lack of leadership.  </p>
<p>Self-styled “conservative” Robert Novak says he distrusts an Imperial Presidency.  Yet, he continually bad-mouths Jimmy Carter and praises Dick Cheney.  Go figure.<br /></p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A22191-2005Jan19.html?sub=AR">Washington Post</a> is reporting that the theme of today’s inauguration speech will be “The Expansion of Freedom.”  From the speech: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>At least he&#8217;s consistent. When confronted with almost any problem around the world, Bush typically answers that the solution is “more freedom”.  When explaining why anyone in the world would dislike the US, Bush typically answers that it’s because they “hate freedom”.  When asked what his foreign policy plans are for the next four years, Bush simply answers “promoting freedom”.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1394393,00.html">Today’s Guardian</a> points out that Tony Blair is echoing this theme: </p>
<blockquote><p>Mr Blair said that, as part of a learning process that began with the invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, the US administration had reached the conclusion that &#8220;in the end, we can take security and military measures against terrorism but&#8230; the best prospect of peaceful coexistence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>But I disagree.  The lack of sufficient “freedom” accounts for at best a small portion of the misery, unhappiness, anger, hatred, violence, and anguish that is felt by much of the world’s population.  Poverty, exploitation, lack of education, lack of basic health care – these are all much more substantial problems in the world today than the lack of “freedom”, and much more important contributors to the evils experienced by so many people in this world every day.</p>
<p>“Freedom” is a red herring.  “Freedom” allows the Bush administration to appear to be doing something to improve the world (and US security) without having to actually spend the time and resources doing the difficult work of addressing fundamental economic problems.  “Freedom” dictates that the US’s spending can be on bombs and guns built in the US rather than on foreign aid, schools, and health care in poor countries around the world.  </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: I think personal freedoms are fundamentally important and incredibly valuable, and I wish everyone in the world could enjoy those freedoms that I have.  But it&#8217;s either naive or disingenuous (I tend to think more of the latter) to suggest that the US can make the world a better, safer place simply by bringing democracy to people who still have to watch their children die of hunger and disease, people who are illiterate and uneducated, people who live without hope of a better life.  “Freedom” is the Bush administration’s stated solution to all of the world’s ills because it gets them what they want, not because it is actually a solution.</p>
