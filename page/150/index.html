<p>Pandering to the Right Fringe</p>
<p>This campaign season has revealed more clearly than ever the ultimate goal of today&#8217;s hard right, as manifested in campaign debates and the right-wing think tanks&#8217; output.  It is nothing less than dismantling the protections established under FDR&#8211;Social Security, Medicare, minimum wage and other safety net protections that are nonetheless thinner than most advanced democracies have&#8211;under the guise that these programs are too costly, do not require personal responsibility, and can&#8217;t be afforded under the new right&#8217;s &#8216;realism&#8217; about the deficits.</p>
<p>The right doesn&#8217;t want to afford these programs. Now that it has managed to &#8216;starve the beast&#8217; through the Bush tax cuts, the repetitive stalling on increasing the debt ceiling, and numerous other revenue reduction measures&#8211;especially in the corporate tax provisions&#8211;it will claim that there is simply nothing else to be done but cut the safety net away.</p>
<p>This is mere spin.  Tax increases and judicious stimulus measures can allow us to recover.  Removing the safety net will  thrust the country into a deep recession, since it will impact seniors, dependent children and the most vulnerable.  The poverty increase that we have witnessed over the last few years will continue. Surely this is not what Americans want for their country!</p>
<p>But the politicians continue to preach the failed approaches of Reaganomics, in the claim that their deregulatory and corporate tax cutting agenda will &#8220;revive&#8221; manufacturing.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Santorum is riding his near-miss in Iowa under the guise of a populist who understands the worries of the downtrodden labor class in America.  The Wall Street Journal (Jan. 7-8, 2012) says that he &#8220;cast[s] himself as an advocate for blue-collar workers and their economically troubled communities, hoping to capitalize on differences with Mr. Romney, a wealthy former private-equity investor and son of a Michigan governor.&#8221;  </p>
<p> Santorum once didn&#8217;t have much money and he has memories of a coal-miner grandfather.  Is that enough to create &#8216;bona fides&#8217; for his views on how we should manage the U.S. economy?    Seeing poverty can help a person to empathize with those in poverty, or it can lead that person to denounce those who remain in poverty as lazy bums who are in poverty from their failure to take the steps the person took to rise above it.  Seeing poverty doesn&#8217;t mean that person understands the kinds of gut-wrenching problems that much of middle America and especially those at the lower end of the distribution are experiencing today&#8211;small towns that are rotting off the map as manufacturing jobs vanish and farms have become corporate enterprises, extensions of Cargill and AMD and Tyson and the few others that dominate the American production of food from seed to harvest to grocer to table. </p>
<p>And the policies that Santorum favors will be extraordinarily destructive of the middle class: they favor the wealthy and corporate enterprises, not the little guy. </p>
<p>Some of the things Santorum is mentioning on the campaign trail might benefit some in the middle class&#8211;like the idea of tripling the exemption for children, though the proposal apparently isn&#8217;t linked to income level and so would not be focused on families that need the help.  (And it would be widely available, adding significantly to the deficit).</p>
<p>The rest of Santorum&#8217;s tax proposals favor the wealthy&#8211;lowering corporate tax rates to half their current level, eliminating corporate tax entirely for manufacturers, eliminating corporate tax on overseas profits that are used to buy manufacturing equipment (not clear whether that applies even if the equipment is used overseas as well, since the current tax code is already too friendly to active overseas businesses), and eliminating taxes on capital income. </p>
<p>Those provisions are most favorable for the wealthy who own most of the corproate stock and other financial assets.  hough the right likes to label these kinds of tax policies &#8216;pro-growth&#8217;, they are in fact a replay of the failed policies of the last 40 years that have resulted in stagnate wages for the middle class and dying small towns, while the beneficiaries of the tax largesse flourish in gated communities.</p>
<p>These tax policies will carve out huge holes in federal revenues, resulting in increased deficits that will be used as justification for decimating earned benefit programs (Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment compensation).  A vicious circle of cutting revenues and then using the loss of revenues to justify cutting important federal programs will leave the middle class (and especially the poor and the near-poor) in even worse condition, as the safety net that is especially needed now is weakened or removed.</p>
<p>These ideas on the right, stale as they are, are getting the kind of attention that cements them in people&#8217;s views, no matter how wrong they are.  In debate after debate, candidates vie with each other to pander to the right.  See, e.g., Santorum Claims Romney&#8217;s Tax PLan Isn&#8217;t Bold Enough, Huff. Post (Jan 9, 2012).  Romney wants to cut taxes and spending and thinks Government is too big, but he at least thinks we need taxes to cover core responsibilities that government should do.  Santorum wants more&#8211;more tax cuts for the wealthy and large corproations. </p>
<p>And when you repeat something over and over, it tends to stick. The American people are hearing these same ideas from every Republican candidate, as they compete to win the radical fringe of the Republican party. </p>
<p>What is worrisome is that progressives are disengaged. They  are miffed about the continuing degradation of civil rights under the continuing &#8220;war&#8221; on terrorism, Obama&#8217;s weakness in not being able to stand up to the Republican minority or even hold to his threat to veto (see, e.g., the pipeline problem) and the way corporate lobbyists are succeeding in causing agencies to weaken or delay important environmental regulations. They are miffed because they had projected onto Obama their specific dreams of revitalization and change, and there is no way that any one person could have satisfied all that.  Much less this person, who was an inexperienced politico with a stable of advisers from Wall Street and past administrations who valued change not one whit. </p>
<p>But it seems fairly obvious that the only hope for progressives is to defeat the resurging right that intends to deregulate, cut taxes and privatize if it gains complete power through control of the White House, House and Senate.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2012/01/the-republicans-lost-privacy.html#ixzz1jAq4oTdw" target="_blank">In the New Yorker</a> comes this note lost in the shuffle of the NH primary.  I sense a pervasive theme of bigger government interference:<br />
<blockquote>Since Ronald Reagan, Republican Presidents (and Presidential nominees) have been committed to overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court’s abortion-rights landmark from 1973. But as the debates last weekend in New Hampshire suggested, the G.O.P. appears to have taken a more extreme step in terms of rolling back the Constitutional right to privacy.</p>
<p>Since the first time Mitt Romney ran for President, four years ago, he’s been on record reversing his previous support for abortion rights. However, when pressed by George Stephanopoulos in the debate Saturday night, Romney went beyond mere opposition to Roe. He said he thought Griswold v. Connecticut, the 1965 case that first made explicit the right to privacy, was also wrong. “I don’t believe they decided that correctly,” Romney said. In this, the front-runner was eagerly seconded by Rick Santorum, who said the Justices “created through a penumbra of rights a new right to privacy that was not in the Constitution.”<br /><a name="more"></a><br />In Griswold, the Court ruled that a Connecticut law banning the sale of contraceptives, even to married couples, was unconstitutional. In the most famous passage from that opinion (which Santorum alluded to) Justice William O. Douglas said, “Specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance. Various guarantees create zones of privacy.” Later, Douglas said, “We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights—older than our political parties, older than our school system.”</p>
<p>Roe has long been controversial, of course. But Griswold, largely, has not. For example, while John Roberts and Samuel Alito were cagey in their references to Roe in their confirmation testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, both of them readily embraced Griswold as a settled precedent of the Court. This is understandable. It is chilling to believe that the Constitution could allow a state to ban married couples from buying birth control. (A few years after Griswold, in a 1972 case called Eisenstadt v. Baird, the Court said states could not ban unmarried people from buying birth control, either.)</p></blockquote>

<p>In a press release <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=252036,00.html">IR 2012-3</a> (Jan. 5, 2012), the IRS has issued <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-12-08.pdf">Notice 2012-8</a> announcing a new revenue procedure updating Rev. Proc. 2003-61.  The IRS describes the effect of the procedure as follows.</p>
<blockquote><p>This proposed update to Rev. Proc. 2003-61 addresses the criteria used in making innocent spouse relief determinations for section 6015(f) equitable relief cases and revises the factors for granting equitable relief. The factors have been revised to ensure that requests for innocent spouse relief are granted under section 6015(f) when the facts and circumstances warrant and that, when appropriate, requests are granted in the initial stage of the administrative process. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The IRS indicates that it will now take into account the other spouse&#8217;s abuse and financial control in making determinations for innocent spouse relief.</p>
<blockquote><p>  <a name="more"></a>
<p>Review of the innocent spouse program demonstrated that when a requesting spouse has been abused by the nonrequesting spouse, the requesting spouse may not have been able to challenge the treatment of any items on the joint return, question the payment of the taxes reported as due on the joint return, or challenge the nonrequesting spouse’s assurance regarding the payment of the taxes. Review of the program also highlighted that lack of financial control may have a similar impact on the requesting spouse’s ability to satisfy joint tax liabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, the proposed Rev. Proc. indicates that a nonrequesting spouse&#8217;s abuse of the requesting spouse may outweigh the fact that the requesting spouse had knowledge of likely noncompliance and that the requesting spouse&#8217;s subsequent compliance is a factor that may weigh in favor of relief.</p>
<blockquote><p>The proposed revenue procedure also provides for certain streamlined case determinations; new guidance on the potential impact of economic hardship; and the weight to be accorded to certain factual circumstances in determining equitable relief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> These appear to be noteworthy and appropriate changes.  It is a problem when legal procedures fail to recognize the way that physical and psychological abuse can limit options for individuals.  This is particularly true in the case of abused spouses, who may not be allowed to question financial statements or tax returns before being forced to sign them by the abusing spouse.</p>

                                <p>By general consensus, Japan&#8217;s &#8220;Lost Decade&#8221; (now in its Third Decade) begins in 1989.

<p>The biggest growth difference appears to come from the U.S. period from the Second (1996) Clinton Tax Reform to the 2001 recession—a big if, I grant you, but one that the Gingrich/DeLay-led Republican Party predicted would produce mayhem, and the alternative-history is not difficult to imagine—I&#8217;m having trouble seeing where the losses are.  Especially if you consider that much of that time was spent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/opinion/sunday/the-true-story-of-japans-economic-success.html">investing in increased infrastructure improvements and health care</a> that have the country well-positioned going forward.</p>

                                <p>Neil Wilson has done yeoman’s duty to (perhaps) achieve a convergence that has been too-long delayed.
<p><a href="http://www.3spoken.co.uk/2011/12/double-entry-view-on-keen-circuit-model.html">A Double Entry View on the Keen Circuit Model</a>.</p>
<p>Steve Keen is, to my knowledge, the only person who is actually encoding a Godley-esque, MMT-style, accounting-based, stock-flow-consistent dynamic simulation model of how economies work. But many MMTers have been quite hostile or at least resistant to Steve’s work, based on some different concepts of endogenous/exogenous money, and — this may seem trivial but it isn’t, at least as it has played out over time — based on details of single- versus double-entry accounting.</p>
<p>The debate has been quite acrimonious at times, and that acrimony has greatly hindered a convergence that in my eyes would be the most salutary event possible in the development of economic thinking and practice.</p>
<p>You can read the details in Neil’s post, but in short he’s re-jiggered Steve’s accounts to make them conform better to (at least Neil’s view of) standard bank-accounting practices. I’m not qualified to evaluate his new formulation, but I am excited to read Neil’s comment on the post, replying to uber-MMTer Scott Fullwiler:</p>
<blockquote><p>We need to get all this pulled together into a coherent overall model.</p>
<p>Steve’s up for it. I hope you are too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll just say: I’m very much up for watching it happen.</p>
<p>Also: run don’t walk to read Steve’s <a href="http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2012/01/03/the-debtwatch-manifesto/">Debtwatch Manifesto</a>, posted last week.</p>

                                <p>Continuing with one of my current <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/menzie-chinn-explains-it-all-for-you-demand-inflation-now.html">hobbyhorses</a>:
<p>Ryan Avent reports on the American Economic Association meeting, with special attention to a presentation by Robert Hall:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/01/monetary-policy">Monetary policy: The zero lower bound in our minds | The Economist</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr Hall argued that:</p>
<p>A little more inflation would have a hugely beneficial impact on labour markets,</p>
<p>And a reasonable central bank would therefore generate more inflation,</p>
<p>And the Federal Reserve as currently constituted is, in his estimation, very reasonable; therefore</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve must not be able to influence the inflation rate.</p>
<p>… Why is Mr Hall—<strong>why are so many economists—willing to conclude that the Fed is helpless rather than just excessively cautious?</strong> I don’t get it; it seems to me that <strong>very smart economists have all but concluded that the Fed’s unwillingness to allow inflation to rise is the primary cause of sustained, high unemployment. </strong>…a macro challenge that actually boils down to the political economy constraints (or intellectual constraints) facing the central bank.</p>

<p>Emphasis mine. I, of course, am less charitable, and impute <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/250-billion-reasons-why-the-fed-hates-inflation-and-doesnt-care-about-employment.html">other motives</a>.</p>

<p>The efficacy of taxation in promoting or discouraging economic growth remains a hotbed of disparate perspectives on the part of economists and policymakers alike. Some politicians insist that more incentives for private investors — lower taxes on corporate profits — will lead to faster and better-balanced growth. According to a New York Times/CBS News poll in May 2011, a majority of Americans believe that increased corporate taxes “would discourage American companies from creating jobs.” The assumed mechanism for spurring economic growth and job creation is new private or business investment, incentivized by lowering the corporate tax burden.</p>
<p>The following graph displays a comparison of net private investment as a percent of GDP against corporate tax receipts as a percent of GDP … for the post-war period 1950 &#8211; 2008. The data is sourced from the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), as follows:</p>
<p>GDP – NIPA table 1.1.5 <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=5&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2009&#038;LastYear=2011">here</a><br />Corporate tax receipts – NIPA table 3.2 <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=87&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2009&#038;LastYear=2011">here</a><br />Net business investment – NIPA table 5.2.5 <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=139&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=2009&#038;LastYear=2010">here</a></p>
<p>At this level of analysis, we should expect to see an inverse relationship between the two, specifically: with a <em>decline, </em>over time<em>,</em> in corporate tax receipts as a percent of GDP, there should be an <em>increase</em> in net private investment over the same time period.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p> Statistically, one would expect these two series to be negatively correlated. </p>
<p><strong>Change in Corporate Taxes and Business Investment, 1950 &#8211; 2008:</strong><br /><img alt="" src="http://i823.photobucket.com/albums/zz151/hagagatan/image001-19.png"><br /><img alt="" src="http://i823.photobucket.com/albums/zz151/hagagatan/image001-22.png"></p>
<p>As the graph shows, <em>both</em> corporate tax receipts and net business investment as a percent of GDP <em>declined</em> over the period 1950 &#8211; 2008. The data does <em>not</em> show an inverse relationship between the two series. Rather, the data shows a substantial <em>positive</em> correlation, i.e., high values in the tax series are associated with high values in the private investment series, and the same association is observed for low values. This counters the idea that business investment <em>increases</em> when the tax burden <em>decreases</em>. Moreover, this decline in business investment suggests that by retaining more and more of their earnings, corporations are failing to make economically productive use of their capital .. and shortchanging growth.</p>

<p>CRS reports on repatriation tax holiday impact
<p>Shortly before the Christmas holiday, CRS released a report by Donald Marples and Jane Gravelle on the possibility of a second repatriation tax holiday for multinational corporations.  <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/files/marples-and-gravelle.-tax-cuts-on-repatriation-earnings-as-economic-stimulus.-an-economic-analysis.-122011.c.rtf">Download Marples and Gravelle. tax cuts on repatriation earnings as economic stimulus. an economic analysis. 122011.c</a></p>
<p>The holiday has been pushed by various commentators who support reducing corporate taxation based on the argument that lower tax, and repatriated earnings, will result in greater investment in domestic business expansion and more US jobs. </p>
<p>Our experience with the 2004 repatriation holiday was not impressive.  Much of the repatriated funds were diverted to share buybacks and not used to increase investments or increase jobs.  IN fact, many companies that repatriated the most money engaged in heavy firings of workers.  Hewlett Packard was notable, with large layoffs accompanying significant repatriated cash.</p>

<p>To repeat that experiment at a time when US companies have even more cash socked away in the US and abroad would merely reward those companies that decided to bet on (and lobby heavily for) a second repatriation holiday that would amount to a huge cut in their taxes&#8211;like having the best of a territorial tax system at the same time that they get all the benefits (foreign tax credits, active financing exception, etc.) of the current worldwide tax regime.</p>
<p>The CRS report doesn&#8217;t suggest that another repatriation holiday would be a sure-fire economic growth engine.  In fact, it notes that it can be counterexpansionary if money is used to address cash-flow problems or to pay out to shareholders.</p>
<blockquote><p>Viewed in the current debate on how to most efficiently stimulate the economy, economic theory suggests that the simulative effect of a temporary tax cut for repatriations may be offset, or more than offset, by exchange rate adjustments that would reduce net exports.</p>
<p>In addition, how businesses use repatriated earnings will impact the stimulative or contractionary effect of a tax cut for repatriations. For example, repatriated earnings will have a larger stimulative effect, or smaller contractionary effect, the greater the degree to which they are used to increase current investment. A smaller stimulative effect or a larger contractionary effect will result, in contrast, if more of the repatriated earnings are used to shore up “cash-flow” issues or pay dividends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A repatriation tax holiday is not a good idea.  it wasn&#8217;t a good idea in 2004.  It is not a good idea now.  There is no reason to give multinational corporations a tax break to bring money back to this country.  They&#8217;re cash rich as it is and can make investments if they want to. </p>

                                <p>Matt Stoller, the former Senior Policy Advisor to Rep. Alan Grayson  and a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute has a couple of very interesting  articles posted at Naked Capitalism,  <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/12/matt-stoller-why-ron-paul-challenges-liberals.html">Why Ron Paul Challenges Liberals</a>, and the follow-up, <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/01/naked-capitalism-a-home-for-all-sorts-of-bircher-nonsense.html">Naked Capitalism, “A Home for All Sorts of Bircher Nonsense”</a></p>
<p>These  are thought-provoking, in many ways insightful, and strike me as  required reading, for a variety of reasons, including some valuable  historical insights.  However, one thought they provoke from me is that  the main thesis is spectacularly wrong-headed.  Stollar talks about what  a great ally Paul&#8217;s staff was, when working on certain issues.  I  should say, &#8220;when working <i>against</i> certain issues&#8221; or  things, like war and the unfettered evil workings of the Federal  Reserve.  The correct vocabulary is worth emphasizing.  Liberals and  Libertarians may find common ground in what they are against, but it is  quite unlikely that they will ever find anything substantial that they  both are for.</p>
<p>Stollar goes on to point out what he calls &#8220;<i>a big problem</i>&#8221;  with liberalism.  This is the mixture of two elements, support for  federal power and the anti-war sentiment that arose with Viet Nam and  has continued though today.  In the same paragraph, Stollar says, &#8220;<i>Liberalism doesn’t really exist much within the Democratic Party so much anymore.</i>&#8221;   This is an important thought, but he doesn&#8217;t pursue it, and as he goes  on seems to conflate Democrats with Liberals, as suits his convenience.   In the final paragraph of the first post he refers to: &#8220;<i>a completely hollow liberal intellectual apparatus arguing for  increasing the power of corporations through the Federal government to  enact their agenda.</i>&#8221;  Seriously, WTF?  I have absolutely no idea what the hell that is supposed to mean.</p>
<p>The second article is especially weak, and essentially devoid of any intellectual content.  Stollar decides to &#8220;<i>highlight a few of the reactions here without much of a rebuttal.</i>&#8221;   Why would anyone do that?  Does he believe the reactions are  self-refuting?   Is he too lazy to rebut, or does he simply not have a  good rebuttal?<br /><a name="more"></a><br />At least he clearly sets forth the thesis of the first article:  &#8220;<i>that the same financing structures that are used to  finance mass industrial warfare were used to create a liberal national  economy and social safety.</i>&#8221;   Here is the source of Stollar&#8217;s  alleged intra-liberal conflict, that Paul is somehow supposed to  illuminate and inform.  Though Stollar says: &#8220;<i>I’ll be describing in much more detail the shifting of the social  contract underlying this failure, which has nothing to do with Ron Paul  and would exist with or without him</i>.&#8221;  So referencing Paul in the first place was a bit of a red herring.</p>
<p>He then goes on to provide extended quotes from posts by <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/no-stoller-and-sullivan-there-is-no.html">David Atkins</a>, who he describes as &#8220;<i>wrestling with what liberalism is</i>&#8221; and <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/on-coherent-liberalism.html">Digby</a>, who he simply rejects out of hand, though with a lot of words that don&#8217;t quite reach the level of snark</p>
<p>What Stollar describes as &#8220;<i>contradictions within modern liberalism</i>&#8221;   boils down to liberalism needing big government to be interventionist,  as Atkins demonstrates, but not imperialistic.  But this is a totally  coherent position. The problem lies not with progressive liberalism, but  with the practical realities of managing a power system &#8211; which is what  governemnt is &#8211; in a way that advances the common good, while holding  the drive for imperialistic and domestic domination in check.  This is  going to be a central practical problem with any governing system or  political philosophy &#8211; at least for one that takes seriously the idea of  advancing the common good.  To say it is the problem of liberalism is  to ignore human nature, political reality, and the entirety of history.</p>
<p>Thus,  a liberal can hold the positions that American involvement in WW II was  necessary, but that our involvement in Viet Nam was not.  Ditto Kosovo,  vis-a-vis Iraq.   One can also recognize that the only entity with  enough heft to balance the power of trans-national mega-corporations is  government, but Stollar does not choose to give that any consideration.</p>
<p>Stollar concludes: &#8220;<i>As the New Deal era model sheds the last trappings of anything  resembling social justice or equity for what used to be called the  middle class (a process which Tom Ferguson has been relentlessly  documenting since the early 1980s), the breakdown will become impossible  to ignore.  You can already see how flimsy the arguments are, from the  partisans.</i>&#8220;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how one gets from the  systematic dismantling of the New Deal by successive Republican  administrations (and you can include both Clinton and Obama in this  list) to the New Deal model shedding anything at all.  And, no, I can&#8217;t  see how flimsy liberal partisan arguments have anything to do with an  assault on the middle class that has taken place from the right.</p>
<p>Stollar  has constructed a straw man problem.  Which is a shame, since there are  real problems to be dealt with.  One is the growth of right wing  populism, as exemplified by the Tea Party &#8211; at least to the extent that  is is real, and not a Fox News fabrication.  Another is to harness the  energy of the Occupy Movements, which provide some evidence that there  is progressive populism that could be a source of real political  strength.  Most critically, though, as things stand now, there is no  political left in this country with any actual power.  </p>
<p><a href="http://coreyrobin.com/2012/01/03/ron-paul-has-two-problems-one-is-his-the-other-is-ours/">Corey Robin describes</a> the central problem of American liberalism in the 21st Century, and closes the loop back to Stollar&#8217;s Ron Paul idea like this.</p>
<div><i>Our problem—and again by “our” I mean a left that’s social democratic  (or welfare state liberal or economically progressive or whatever the  hell you want to call it) and anti-imperial—is that we don’t really have  a vigorous national spokesperson for the issues of war and peace, an  end to empire, a challenge to Israel, and so forth, that Paul has in  fact been articulating.  The source of Paul’s positions on these issues  are not the same as ours (again more reason not to give him our  support).  But he is talking about these issues, often in surprisingly  blunt and challenging terms. Would that we had someone on our side who  could make the case against an American empire, or American supremacy,  in such a pungent way.</i></div>
<p>Digging a level  deeper, the reason we don&#8217;t have such a spokesperson is that our  political system is essentially owned by corporate interests, which is  why we get alleged liberals like Clinton and Obama in Democratic  leadership, while genuine progressives like Bernie Sanders, Dennis  Kucinich, and even Alan Grayson are marginalized.  On top of this, the  right has a vigorous and powerful propaganda machine &#8211; hence the Tea  Party; and the small number of progressive voices in broadcast media is  nowhere close to providing a balance.</p>
<p>Money owns  politics, and corporate interests, along with a small entrenched elite,  own the vast majority of the money.  The key to achieving progressive  solutions is to get the money out of politics.  But in the wake of  Citizens United, that prospect is a forlorn hope.  That is my &#8220;<i>coherent structural critique of the American political order</i>&#8221; in one short paragraph.</p>

<p>What is a safe asset?</p>
<p>Last month, <a target="_blank" href="http://macromarketmusings.blogspot.com/2011/12/why-global-shortage-of-safe-assets.html">David Beckworth</a> at Macro and Other Market Musings had some interesting thoughts on the global shortage of safe assets. His essay got me thinking about what is a safe asset? Beckworth alludes to three definitions of ‘safe’: (1) a credit being AAA-rated, (2) satisfying a certain level of liquidity to be used in repo markets (an important aspect of US credit transactions), and (3) backed by a sovereign with sufficient (and targeted) aggregate nominal income. I would agree with (2) and (3) in a broader context, but not necessarily (1).

<p>Why does a ‘safe’ asset need to be AAA? To be sure, <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/2011/12/21/the-broad-sovereign-downgrade/">the share of AAA sovereigns</a> of 76 developed and developing/emerging sovereigns fell by 3% in 2011 compared to 2007. This should hardly be surprising, given the weak recoveries and leverage that exists in the developed markets. But it’s liquidity, and to a lesser extent, sovereign risk that matters, not the rating, per se. Furthermore, ‘safe’ is a matter of perspective.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Liquidity is a pre-requisity for a ‘safe asset’ so that investors can purchase this asset in even the harshest of times. The United States runs the most liquid bond and currency market in the world; it <em>can</em> satisfy demand from flight-to-safety in times of stress. But one can think of liquidity in another manner: the ability to print fiat currency that is used to honor the debt instrument (asset). The US government <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/debtb2011q3.html">issued just 8% of its external government debt position</a> in non-dollar form. Better put: the US is a ‘safe’ assets because it’s a market large enough to satisfy broad demand and the US government is always going to be able to honor its debts. Liquidity is the most important definition of a safe asset, rather than the rating.</p>
<p>Norway prints its own currency, in which most of its bonds are denominated. However, it will never be a ‘safe asset’. The bond market is just not capable of satisfying broad demand during times of stress. So while Norway has enjoyed AAA status since 1975 (according to Bloomberg), it’s never going to be a safe-haven bond market for the global economy. Norway may be <em>perceived </em>as ‘safe’, though, due to its AAA status; but that’s of secondary concern.</p>
<p>And now I get to my second point: <em>perception of safety</em>. On December 5, 2011, S&#038;P put the entire Euro area (EA) on credit watch  negative, <a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?articleType=HTML&#038;assetID=1245325253951">including Germany</a>. If Germany were downgraded to AA+, does this mean that it is less ‘safe’? I would argue quite the opposite. Specifically, for all EA investors &#8211; using external debt statistics from the World Bank/IMF, I calculate that EA government debt held outside the EA amounts to 24% of GDP – the bund market (the German sovereign bond market) would enjoy an increase in safe haven status relative to other European economies. The reason is, that EA investors are likely euro investors, and Germany is the most liquid and perceived safest debt market in the EA. So unless you want to take currency risk, which ditracts from the ‘safety’, then EA investors are likely to flock to safe within the EA.</p>
<p>Until the German investors themselves start to seek non-euro assets, the German bund market is likely to increase in ‘safety’ from the perspective of euro (as a region or the currency) investors without regard to the rating of the sovereign. This goes against intuition that safe assets have higher ratings.</p>
<p>More on safe assets in another post. That’s enough for today. <em><strong>Rebecca Wilder</strong></em></p>
