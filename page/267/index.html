<p>Matt Yglesias <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/10/is-housing-inherently-bubbly/#comments">wonders</a> if people have to speculate in housing.  What if someone wants to buy a house but doesn&#8217;t want to gamble that house prices will increase ?  Is there anything to be done ?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In theory, this problem has been solved. It is now possible for home buyers to hedge. It is also possible for professional investors to speculate in housing. I&#8217;m not sure they would do better than the amateurs, look how well the RMBS and stock markets function. </p>
<p>The solution, in theory, is the Case-Shiller house price index. You can roughly hedge the price of a house you own using the index. The problem is that the risk you want to hedge is that you want to sell the house and it is cheap. So long as you own the same house, the price only matters for property tax assessments. </p>
<p>Shiller really really honestly believed that he had made the world a much better place when he confinced the Chicago Commodities board to introduce trading in the index. But then almost no one traded it (what if you held an index and nobody came ?). </p>
<p>I think that the correct innovation which will really fix things is one in which the balance of a mortgage is indexed to the Case-Shiller index. If the index were perfectly matched to your home, your equity in the house would just grow with repayments minus interest. Oh the interest to be paid would be constant (OK indexed to wages or the CPI to be perfect), not a constant times the balance owed. So, to the extent that the index worked, interest and principle payments and equity in the house wouldn&#8217;t depend on housing price fluctuations. </p>
<p>This makes mortgage initiators waay long the local Case-Shiller house price index, but they can hedge that risk by shorting it. </p>
<p>Problem solved (except for people who own their houses outright and, hey they can bear a bit of risk) ?   Or not ?</p>

<p><strong>Americans are voting on the wrong information  </strong><br />crossposted with <a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/">Ataxingmatter</a></p>
<p>Even the Washington Post knows it&#8211;a new Bloomberg poll shows that Americans have wrong information about the Obama Administration&#8217;s record.   see <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/29/AR2010102901403.html">Americans Don&#8217;t Know</a>, Oct, 29 2010.  They mistakenly think taxes have increased (they haven&#8217;t&#8211;they&#8217;ve gone down), that the TARP money won&#8217;t ever be repaid (most of it already has been, and the bailout amounts still at risk are those used to bolster mortgage lenders); and that the economy is worse off because of the stimulus (not so&#8211;more than a million more jobs would have been lost without the stimulus, and many important public priorities have been funded).</p>
<p>The Obama administration has cut taxes &#8212; largely for the middle class &#8212; by $240 billion since taking office Jan. 20, 2009. A program aimed at families earning less than $150,000 that was contained in the stimulus package lowered the burden for 95 percent of working Americans by $116 billion, or about $400 per year for individuals and $800 for married couples. Other measures include breaks for <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/13/AR2010101306940.html">college education</a>, moderate- income families and the unemployed and incentives to promote renewable energy.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Still, the poll shows the message hasn&#8217;t gotten through to Americans, especially middle-income voters. By 52 percent to 19 percent, likely voters say federal income taxes have gone up for the middle class in the past two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all about raising taxes,&#8221; says poll respondent Jeanette Bagley, 74, a retired home health aide in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota. &#8220;He&#8217;s all about big government and big spending.&#8221;</p>
<p>The view that taxes have gone up is shared by a majority of almost all demographic groups, including 50 percent of independent voters, among the linchpins of Obama&#8217;s victory in the 2008 election.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[We recovered most of the TARP money, but] 60 percent of respondents say they believe most of the TARP money to the banks is lost and only 33 percent say most of the funds will be recovered.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the past year, the economy has grown 3 percent and is expected to show improvement in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Voters aren&#8217;t seeing the better climate: 61 percent of poll respondents say the economy is shrinking this year, compared with 33 percent who say it is growing.</p>
<p>The WaPo article notes a pollster who blames the Dems for not communicating well enough about the way that the economy has improved during their stewardship. Certainly at least partly to blame.  But I suspect some of the blame also goes to those anonymously funded attack ads and robo-calls that distort and misrepresent. For example, I got a recorded call today from some right-wing organization that started out with &#8220;the Democrats are lying to you&#8221; and went on with multiple distortions.  <em>The Atlantic</em> notes &#8220;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/10/5-reasons-americans-are-so-wrong-about-major-economic-facts/65397/">Five Reasons Americans Are So Wrong About Major Economic Facts</a>&#8220;&#8211;both of those reasons are in the five, as well as the media&#8217;s failure to inform, the response of people to their own economic misfortunes (when an economy feels bad to you, then you will believe the negative attack ads more readily, I guess), and our own individual failure to exercise our responsibility to know the facts rather than buying the garbage.  Yes, that last is a huge one, as the Atlantic says:</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a simple culprit: us. The civic responsibility to know basic stuff about the economy ultimately falls on citizens. It might feel like the banks are still living with our tax money, or that taxes have increased or will soon, or that the economy hasn&#8217;t grown in forever. But that doesn&#8217;t make it right.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure:  Americans will not vote wisely when the groups competing for their vote don&#8217;t deal honestly with the real issues that face this nation.  Wake up, America.  China just built a far faster supercomputer than any we&#8217;ve built.  We should be funding technology and innovation that will guide our economy into a better future.  We should not be electing zany, tax cutting, Social Security privatizating, global warming deniers who want more of the ostrich-head-in-the-sand economic policies that got us into this mess to start with.</p>

                                <p>Yesterday Eurostat released the September unemployment rate figures for the European Union and the Eurozone. From <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-29102010-AP/EN/3-29102010-AP-EN.PDF">the release</a>:<em><br />
<blockquote><em>The euro area1 (EA16) seasonally-adjusted2 unemployment rate3 was 10.1% in September 2010, compared with [downward revised] 10.0% in August4. It was 9.8% in September 2009. The EU27 unemployment rate was 9.6% in September 2010, unchanged compared with August4. It was 9.3% in September 2009.</p>

<p>Across the Eurozone 16 countries, just 5 have seen their unemployment rates fall since October 2009 (I use the <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database">teilm020 table at Eurostat</a>, which limits the time series to this time frame). Note that the unemployment rate in Italy rose over the month (8.1% to 8.3%), so unemployment rate is <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/10/unemployment-in-europe-improving-ever.html">now unchanged since last year.</a></p>

This is good, but the improvement is sluggish.</p>

                                <p>Max Sawicky, on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/maxbsawicky">his Twitter feed</a>, sends us to <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/stocks/higher-hedge-fund-taxes-would-hurt-little-guys-too-21571/">this classic piece from Donald Luskin</a><br />
<blockquote>Believe me, if we raise taxes on hedge-fund managers we&#8217;ll get fewer hedge-fund managers. Today, with lots of hedge-fund managers trading all the time and keeping markets efficient, stocks are at record highs around the globe and markets are deeper, more liquid and less volatile. With fewer hedge-fund managers, markets would shrink, become more volatile and more costly, and tumble from their present highs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The date on the piece is 20 July 2007.  Just over three months later—pretty much exactly three years ago—the IB-sponsored MBS origination market effectively died, having taken much more value than was produced by the underlying property and placed it firmly into the pockets of traders and originators who knew that the present value they were claiming was—let us be nice—overoptimistic.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a piece missing from the debate on the impact pension cuts on a consumer and credit driven economy (<a href="http://remappingdebate.org/article/coming-boomer-pension-cuts-what-impact-economy" target="_blank">Coming boomer pension cuts&#8230;what impact on the economy</a>, by Diana Jean Schemo) might have on the Great Recession.</p>
<p>It is long and has great links:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the last two decades, pension cutbacks have left relatively few private sector workers with defined benefit pensions plans. Now, with health and pension funds for state and local government employees said to be facing massive funding shortfalls, many are describing the guaranteed retirement benefits paid to teachers, police officers, street cleaners, and other public workers as overly expensive and sclerotic. These pensions, the argument goes, are unrealistic — they are throwbacks to another era that must now be curbed.<br /><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>&#8230;If there is one document that can be said to have galvanized public alarm over the state of public pensions, it would be an analysis issued by the Pew Center on the States last February. The study, whose findings were reported by almost every major media outlet and echoed by countless lawmakers and pundits, threw a spotlight on public sector pensions and health benefits for retirees, estimating that these obligations were under-funded by at least $1 trillion. It urged drastic and immediate action to put existing pensions on more solid footing, and to lower future taxpayer obligations by curbing benefits. In state houses across the land, lawmakers are heeding the call.</p>
<p>But another major analysis of the movement in pensions, alarming from a different perspective, drew virtually no notice. The November 2009 study, by researchers at the Social Security Administration and the Urban Institute, modeled the consequences over the next 22 years of eliminating many defined benefit pensions. The report projected what would happen if, over the ensuing five years, all defined benefit plans in the private sector were frozen, and a third of all state and local government plans were also frozen. It then asked: what would that mean for the income of Boomers when they reach the age of 67, between now and 2032?<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Remarkably, the report disappeared into a media and public policy-making void. Not a single newspaper covered the report’s projections and, according to Nexis, the news database, they have never come up in public hearings or testimony debating the future of defined pension benefits.</p>
<p>Drawing on more than 100,000 employee records, the report makes its forecast based on the premise that current participants in defined benefit plans would collect benefits based on their previous service, but would not accumulate additional benefits. Based on past practice, the model also assumes that employers would shift their contributions to 401(k) plans. (The assumption may or may not hold entirely true, given that the aim of cutting retirement guarantees is largely to save money.)</p>
<p>With 50 to 56 percent of Boomers not in line to receive defined benefit pensions — in part, a result of the abandonment of defined benefit pensions that has already occurred in the private sector — the report found that many Boomer retirees would be unaffected by the changes envisioned in the model. But among those who do receive such pensions, the changes would be substantial. The report broke its findings down by four waves of Boomers, from the eldest, born just after World War II, to the youngest, born in 1964. In each wave, there would be more losers than winners, with the repercussions for the youngest Boomers most severe: 26 percent of them would lose an average of $4,200 in retirement income, while 11 percent would see their incomes rise by an average of $2,800.<br />The result: a net decline in retirement income among Boomers, in 2010 dollars, of roughly $46.3 billion a year once all Boomers have retired.</p>
<p>Taking the Social Security Administration report, and then drawing on census data to calculate the aggregate net impact on each cohort of Boomers, it appears that the net loss would be $2.9 billion a year among the oldest Boomers, $10.4 billion a year among the group that will turn 67 starting in 2018, $17.1 billion a year for those retiring around 2023, and $17.8 billion for those retiring between 2028 and 2032.</p>
<p>Allowing for deaths as the population ages, Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution who helped develop the mathematical model used in the pension study, suggested a graduated formula for calculating the accumulated impact once all Boomers have retired. The result: a net decline in retirement income among Boomers, in 2010 dollars, of roughly $46.3 billion a year once all Boomers have retired.</p>
<p>That scale of loss, said Rodrigue Tremblay, an economist who has written widely of the risk of “stagflation,” would weaken the larger economy.</p>
<p>“Because Boomers represent some 75 million consumers, any spending cut by this group will have a profound impact on the overall economy,” Tremblay said. “This could precipitate a vicious cycle of slow growth, with fewer jobs for the young.” Boomers would not only retire with less disposable income, but — anticipating a less secure retirement — would spend less in the years leading up to retirement.</p>
<p>“Such a shift in pension plans represents, and will represent even more so in the future, a tremendous shift of investment risk from employers to retirees, and will negatively influence the macro economy,” Tremblay said, as retirees “spend less and save more to compensate for lower incomes and for a greater expected volatility in their income flows.”</p></blockquote>

                                <p>There’s a reason for <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2010_10/026344.php" target="_blank">this</a>.
</p>
<p>After <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/10/fire-tim-geithner-then-be-one-term.html" target="_blank">the (wholly justified, understated) bitterness of my last post</a>, a moment of cheer:  An old friend of mine is in the process of losing his job.</p>
<p>Now, normally I wouldn’t celebrate anyone—let alone a friend—losing a job, but, you see, he sells medical insurance in Texas and Indiana.  And he’s been told that over the next three years, his income will be reduced, and basically eliminated entirely ca. 2015.</p>
<p>Translation on a macro level: insurance companies—far from acting as if they are “uncertain”—are cutting the commissions they are paying to agents in preparation for greater competition as the phases of the PPACA come into effect.</p>
<p>We have already seen variations on this: insurance companies that will no longer write policies for only parents, because their children have other options.  Insurance companies complaining about the “cost” of having to cover basic services—you know, the <em>preventive care</em> that would seem to be implied when you call your plan a “Health Maintenance Organization” and which is covered by State Medicaid plans such as NJ FamilyCares.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The English translation of “the market won’t support it” is “we can’t compete with our current structure.”  It is a tale told by a capitalist since the beginning of double-entry accounting, with the steel industry being a recent example of American Rebirth.) Economists us the phrase “creative destruction” to explain it, even though there is very little creative and a lot of destruction (or, in significant cases, structural shifting) that goes on at the time.</p>
<p>“Bending the cost curve” means producing more consumer surplus. This is what competition does in economic models, primarily by cutting margins (“excess <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent" target="_blank">rent</a>”) and thereby making firms allocate capital and labor more efficiently.  When your margins are large—through monopoly power, including “monopolist competition”—<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer_surplus.asp" target="_blank">consumer surplus</a> is low. Since Steve Jobs is the sexiest human being in the world, Apple products sell for higher margins than other communication/computing devices do.  This may always be so—or maybe the world will shift to Android phones, a and the Apple of five years from now will look like the Apple of 15 years ago, taking cash from Microsoft in order to survive.</p>
<p>Health insurance is an area hasn’t had true competition—search costs are too high for most people.  (Indeed, the evil of employer-provided health insurance deductibility isn’t that it is a suboptimal allocation of resources so much as it is that that pre-tax money allows insurance companies to maintain higher margins without the consumer feeling the full cost of their loss.  It is a system that perpetuates excess rent being paid, effectively as a transfer from the government to the insurer.)  One of the first things health economists noted about Medicare Part D is that, while one had to “shop” to find an insurer, the effort required meant that very few people would then <em>switch</em>, even if the insurer later reaped excess rent.  When switching costs (consumer) are higher than menu costs (supplier), excess rent is virtually an inevitability.  (In this case, again, the American taxpayer is footing a large portion of the bill for a transfer to insurance companies.  It is impossible to believe, given the bill’s enactment process, that this was not considered a feature.)</p>
<p>So there are multiple areas where consumer surplus is low in the health insurance industry.  Which means that many people—including my friend—have been “earning” more than they are “producing”—some of the excess rent is distributed, after all.  And, for the next few years, they will be seeing their incomes decline while people believe (as Jon Stewart said to Barack Obama last night) that PPACA will not take effect until 2014.</p>
<p>And Obama’s reply (starting around 7:30) was spot-on:</p>

<p>So for the next few years, people such as my friend will see that the squeeze is hitting them, while the benefits haven’t reached all of the general populace.  (They have already reached <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/health/policy/31health.html" target="_blank">many children</a>—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Effective_September_23.2C_2010" target="_blank">including adult children who can’t find a job and can at least be insured by their parents</a>—and helped <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2010/03/22/health-care-reform-passed-so-what-does-it-mean/" target="_blank">many senior citizens who were being affected by the “donut hole</a>.”)</p>
<p>We saw this same sequence in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the travel field—slowly at first, and then quickly as internet bookings and purchases determined solely by price became the rule. The survivors were the agencies with large corporate accounts and the ones that provided specialty (“niche”) services you couldn’t get from Travelocity and its competitors.</p>
<p>The travel agency market existed for one reason: in the old days, it cost an airline about 16 cents of every dollar to get a seat booked.  An agent who could be paid 8-11% per ticket—with incentives for volume—was a bargain.  It was, to use the economist’s favorite cliché, a win-win situation. And the benefits of tour and hotel bookings could truly be treated as marginal cost increases, with their own revenue stream generally more than enough to justify for even a small office.</p>
<p>But true competition—the decline in the incremental Search Costs presented to consumers by Travelocity and its competitors, followed quickly by direct booking availability directly with a specific airline—meant the end of that model, leading to industry consolidation, downsizings, and closings—just as the insurance agents are feeling the pressure now of the impending “exchanges.”</p>
<p>And, as then, my friend noted that there are still areas that will continue to be profitable for insurance agents in 2015.  For insurance, policy service for the elderly.  (Showers of gratitude from the insurance agents to the unfunded, deficit-exploding Medicare Part D shall continue.)  Everything else will see the agents’s livelihood affected as the insurance companies try to protect their own share of the turf.</p>
<p>He has four years to prepare, and a roadmap for change that remains valuable. And for those interested in “bending the cost curve,” the first fruits of that effort are being realized.  And people are realizing they will have to change their lifestyle and practices to deal with the new world.</p>

                                <p>by <strong>Beverly Mann</strong><br />lifted from an e-mail, used with permission of the author of the blog <a href="http://annarborist.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><strong>The Annarborist</strong></a></p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/us/28execute.html?_r=1&#038;emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y" target="_blank">article</a> in the <em>New York Times</em> on <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/102610zr.pdf" target="_blank">this one page</a> court order by the Supreme Court elicited the following response from Beverly Mann:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Eric M. Freedman, a law professor at Hofstra University, said that the lesson of the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Landrigan case was ‘crime pays.’</p>
<p>“He explained: ‘The state flatly stonewalled the lower courts by defying orders to produce information, and then was rewarded at the Supreme Court by winning its case on the basis that the defendant had not put forward enough evidence. That is an outcome which turns simple justice upside-down and a victory that the state should be ashamed to have obtained.’” </i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is part of a Roberts Court trend that is, in my opinion, so very John Roberts: The erection of a cute procedural tautology that eliminates access to federal court because the specific evidence that the person trying to gain access (the “plaintiff”; the “petitioner”) will need to prove the claim is solely in the possession of the corporation or government entity that the claim is against.
</p>
<p>Last year, in a case called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashcroft_v._Iqbal." target="_blank"><i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</i></a>, the 5-4 crowd held it appropriate and in fact obligatory that trial-level federal judges dismiss civil lawsuits, willy-nilly, if the judge declares that the formal complaint (the document filed with the court that initiates the lawsuit) lacks evidentiary specificity sufficient to <i>prove</i> the case. This defies a longstanding federal statute known as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), which explicitly bars dismissals of lawsuits in such grounds.</p>
<p>But no matter; the originalist/textualist/non-judicial-activist justices effectively rewrote that statute—eliminating the plaintiff’s or petitioner’s right to require the corporation or government entity to disclose the evidentiary specifics, e.g., internal memos; product test results; police audiotapes; (in the <i>Landgrigan</i> case) documents showing where the drug was manufactured and what it contains.</p>
<p>What’s most stunning about the order in <i>Landrigan</i> is the 5-4’s bald, deliberate conflation of the standard of proof for barring the execution using this drug and the standard for staying the execution until the state provided the evidence sought. These are—or at least were—two separate standards. And logic requires that they remain so.</p>
<p>This new rule of law that you have to present evidence that your opponent is keeping from you before you’re entitled to access to federal court is a dream come true for perpetrators of corporate and government malfeasance. And its quasi-legislative authors on the Supreme Court are frightening diabolical in quietly promulgating that rule of law.</p>

<blockquote><p>In today&#8217;s Washington Post business section, Lori Montgomery has a big article on &#8220;A renewed focus on spending,&#8221; starting with how the GOP is making noises about cutting spending to cut the deficit without raising taxes, while not mentioning anything too serious, although Boehner supposedly might be open to cutting some loopholes in the tax code, thereby de facto raising taxes, if Grover Norquist will let him (assuming as most think that the GOP will take control of the House after next week&#8217;s election), and if anybody thinks elimination of the tax deduction for mortgage interest is remotely on the table in a period with a terrible housing market, there is a bridge in Brooklyn for sale to them. Then most of the article lugubriously goes on about all the efforts at supposed bipartisanship on the Deficit Commission.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Yet again, we read about all this agreement to &#8220;stabilize social security finances&#8221; by raising future retirement ages, because &#8220;The current Social Security program will not survive based on upon current rules.&#8221; Well, beating a drum beaten often here, this latter is so much baloney. However, the rest of it is even worse. We get scare stories about the deficit of the last two years, when about half of this is due to the recession and the rapidly disappearing stimulus package, while the other half is due to the Bush tax cuts and increased defense spending due to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which will hopefully wind down in the not too distant future. </p>
<p>Raising future retirement ages does a great big doodley-squat nothing about any near term deficit, although Lori Montgomery and other reporters somehow fail to point this out in their so-called reporting. So, we suffer from an ongoing deterioration of discourse on this subject as the same old groups and politicians push the same old nonsense formuli for solving a problem that will hopefully mostly take care of itself, with almost no offsetting commentary, although undoing the tax cut part of the deficit is not going to happen if the GOP takes over the House.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Credit: A Vicious Spiral</strong><br />by <strong>Tom aka Rusty Rustbelt</strong></p>
<p>Somehow over the years I became known as a bit of an expert in personal financial planning, I suppose the tax background plus getting dragged into senior financial planning (via my involvement in nursing homes and eldercare) and business client planning. I was also pretty good at assembling professional teams and keeping the right focus.</p>
<p>While I do not really practice any personal financial planning (except at the coffee shop pro bono) I do keep informed and I do troll my network for updates, and lecture now and again.</p>
<p>The Great Recession is hammering credit scores, for all of the obvious reasons. At the same time lenders, have been whipped for lending too easily, are raising standards and looking for higher credit scores.</p>
<p>So we get into a spiral of lower credit scores, higher credit standards, less lending, more credit problems, lower credit scores, etc. etc.</p>
<p>And if the economy does not come around soon, we may require a generation to get totally out of the cycle.</p>
<p>There will likely be more subprime credit available, at higher rates. Some retailers (such as auto makers) will use their own credit subsidiaries to lower rates and keep traffic coming. All in all, it is going to prolong the mess and prolong the misery.</p>
<p>The big reset, the &#8220;new normal&#8221; is upon us.</p>
