<p>In the past I have travelled or lived in most parts of the U.S. and in visiting the local tavern, bar or lounge am offered some choices in types and serving sizes of beer. Most places by answering &#8216;bottle&#8217; to the question &#8216;bottle or draft&#8217; you are locked into a measured 12&#8243; serving, no more no less, which is why in most places outside Texas and maybe Colorado you can&#8217;t go too wrong ordering &#8216;a bottle of Bud&#8217; (though you might get some dirty looks by asking for a cold glass). But if you chose &#8216;draft&#8217; you can be in uncertain territory.  Most places will give you some choice between small, large and pitcher where the small is somewhat smaller than the 12 ounces you get in a bottle and the large is modeled on the English pint. But as experienced travelers/drinkers understand all too well &#8216;pint&#8217; in too many places has little relation to its standard definition of &#8217;16 ounces&#8217;, in fact in a lot of places if you order a 12 ounce bottle and a cold &#8216;pint&#8217; glass the resultant pour gets you suspiciously close to the rim. Which is why in my own State of Washington you never encounter &#8216;pints&#8217; outside an Irish Bar or brew pub, instead we drink &#8216;pounders&#8217;. Now since a standard pint of water weighs exactly a pound the implication is that your &#8216;pounder&#8217; actually contains sixteen ounces, but it is not like this is an actual violation of truth in advertising laws, most people know the score, you are lucky to get 14 ounces in a pounder and 42 ounces in a pitcher.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with Social Security? Well it offers a different way of examining what &#8216;solvency&#8217; means in relation to SS: should we be worried how close the pour is to the rim? Or to the actual contents of the serving? And the answer to that question ends up having some surprising  constraints on your policy options. Actual Social Security discussion under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Social Security solvency is mostly reckoned in terms of income to cost ratio and presented as either a percentage of projected payroll or GDP over the given projection period. But neither that projected income or projected cost is fixed, each instead is the product of a formula or formulae whose factors are determined by actual economic and demographic outcomes compared to the baseline assumptions. And it is in my view the failure among most commentators to fully grasp that variability that distorts the policy decision field.</p>
<p>Starting at the cost end we have this CBO study from 2003: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4380&#038;type=0">The Future Growth of Social Security: It&#8217;s Not Just Society&#8217;s Aging</a>. If we examine its figures and tables we can see that fully 45% of the projected growth in Social Security over the 75 year projection period is due to improvements in real benefits delivered compared to today, in terms  of our metaphor the Trustees are promising us that if all things go right our &#8216;pint&#8217; will actually have more content ounces going forward than today and cumulatively a lot more, at the end of the day we are drinking something closer to those beer steins you see at Munich&#8217;s Oktoberfest. Prost! But a look at the revenue end gives us some more sobering news, while Social Security left unchanged can deliver 100% of scheduled benefits right up to 2037, in our metaphor a pour  right up to the rim, after that projected revenues only deliver a 78% pour. Hmm, downer. But how down should we actually be? This graph from  Dean Baker at CEPR (though designed to illustrate a different point) is instructive: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/cepr-blog/social-security-and-the-washington-post-who-is-going-down-first">Social Security and the Washington Post: Who Is Going Down First?</a>. What the graph shows is a fairly dramatic cutback in benefits at Trust Fund depletion, in numeric terms 22%. But note that the resulting beer stein STILL holds more ounces of beer than the one retirees get today, indeed about 20% more ounces. Moreover the pour starts improving  in short order and by mid-century is as big as it ever was and then stein and pour continue to grow throughout the projection period. Now if we take the 2010 to 2037 line and extend it we see that our retiree/drinker of 2085 coulda/woulda been drinking from a full stein some 25% bigger than the one he ends up with. But  still his daily beer ration remains more than double of what it is today.</p>
<p>Most policy discussions today hyperfocus on ways to get the stein and the pour into perfect alignment. Social Security &#8216;reformers&#8217; tend to focus on ways to shrink the stein to meet the projected pour, preferably without a sudden transition that will upset the customers. Veteran beer drinkers will recognize this approach, typically bartenders wanting to skimp on beer serving sizes simply swap out their &#8216;pints&#8217; with ones with gradually thicker sides and bottoms, the result looks the same and feels the same in your hand, but over time just doesn&#8217;t deliver the same zip. On the other hand supporters of traditional Social Security like Angry Bear&#8217;s Dale Coberly focus on ways to keep the pour right up to the rim of the growing stein, in Dale&#8217;s case by pointing out that the cost to the customer for that brimful of beer is just pennies per week. But I suggest what is important is not the alignment of brim and pour but the actual amount of the pour.</p>
<p>This post was inspired by an exchange between Dean and Henry Aaron of Brookings that I was privy to in which Aaron made the following observation in relation to the effect of higher real wages or an adjustment in the payroll cap adding to the total Social Security wage base:<br />
<blockquote>A larger tax base has some effect on benefits.  Since 1972, the system gains only very little, because a higher wage base raises taxes today and benefits later on; the system makes money on the time-value of money, but nothing else (in the pre-indexing days, the story is more complex).</p></blockquote>
<p> And if you define a balanced &#8216;system&#8217; with a perfect alignment between brim and pour this is quite true. But if you focus on actual pour size that &#8216;nothing else&#8217; becomes something pretty significant. If we turn again to Dean&#8217;s figure and plug in higher real wages and a larger wage base oveall the effect is to drive the dark blue benefit line into a steeper rise. This does not necessarily delay the time of Trust Fund Depletion or the percentage of reset but it does or should change the resultant pour, from the perspective of the worker the same percentage cut from a higher baseline means more beer today and  more beer than projected in the long term.</p>
<p>Some beer drinkers feel cheated if their &#8216;pint&#8217; is not filled to the point that it overflows onto the serving tray as it is being brought to the table. Me I&#8217;ll just take that honest pint. Now looking forwards I would want as big a pour as I could get in my growing stein but my concern would be measuring from the bottom of the stein to the top of the pour and not the top of the pour to the rim of the stein, in the end I am a beer drinker wanting my fair serving whatever the variations in the glassware.</p>

<p>These images, derived from passive microwave satellite data, depict the most recent daily sea ice conditions. Along with current and median total extent, the daily extent graph also includes the extent during 2007, the year of the record low minimum extent (dashed green line). Note that during the transition across the calendar year, data from 2006 or 2008 is included for continuity of the plot with the 2007 record year. This comparison shows the substantial recent change observed in Northern Hemisphere sea ice.</p>

<blockquote><p>What the researchers found was a scientific story more in line with what people were witnessing on the ground. Weather along the Arctic latitudes was behaving more unpredictably than in other parts of the world. “That’s an incredibly important parameter to care about, incredibly important,” said Weatherhead. “The way I try to describe it to some people, if we get an inch of rain out at my house in the month of July, I don’t need to turn on the sprinklers. But if we get an inch of rain on July 1, and no rain after that, my lawn is dead.” </p></blockquote>

<p>By Becky Bruce<br />
<blockquote>UTAH COUNTY &#8212; The recession may not feel like it&#8217;s really over yet, but the Utah Department of Transportation&#8217;s I-15 CORE project is helping to the tune of more than a thousand jobs. </p>
<p>The I-15 CORE project has already created 1,000-plus jobs to date, and spokeswoman Heather Barnum says that number could double next summer. </p>
<p>Plus, Barnum says, it&#8217;s helping the economy in other ways. </p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re building a road you need aggregates, you need steel, you need trucks, even, on the project,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So we always try to look, where do we have things locally?&#8221; </p>
<p>As a result, 95 percent of the supplies used for the CORE project come from inside the state. </p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t count boosts from other things, like workers stopping for lunch at a local café &#8212; all of which contribute to the local economy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Health Care: Comparative Effectiveness Research, Gender and Emotion</p>
<p>A key cost bending feature of PPACA (Obamacare) is comparative effectiveness research (see http://www.hhs.gov/recovery/programs/cer/index.html).</p>
<p>This research is designed to apply statistical, economic and clinical analysis to care and treatment to encourage effective care and block ineffective treatments.</p>
<p>It is highly likely, based on current research, the statisticians will recommend less screening and much less treatment for prostate cancer. As my doc says, &#8220;almost all old men die with prostate cancer, almost none of them die from prostate cancer.&#8221; Screening should likely be focused on younger men and more aggressive forms of the cancer.</p>
<p>With men being somewhat nonchalant about such matters, and prostate cancer being something less than a celebrity telethon issue, it is unlikely there will much of a fuss. Money can be saved and the resulting increased mortality will be slight.</p>
<p>At the same time, current recommendations about breast cancer are suggesting a lot less mammography, and there is an uproar.</p>
<p>(I must plead guilty to being protective and emotional, Mrs. R. will have annual mammography, despite a clean history and no risk factors, if I have to pay out of my own pocket.)</p>
<p>Breast cancer hits many women, hits many younger women, and the results are horrifying. The blowback from advocacy groups has been and will be fierce.</p>
<p>So can we get past gender and emotion to become more efficient and effective? I doubt it, and readily admit I am one of the culprits.</p>

<p>Key players in the development of this story are judges in each state as they interpret state law defining proper ownership.  Inquiry to two people who know courts predicted most judges would probably simply ignore technical discrepancies, but as the story develops these issues are gaining traction.  Bypassing property laws is a big no-no perhaps.</p>

<p><strong>Drug wars in Juarez…and the cause&#8212;NAFTA, really</strong>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/05/mexico-drug-war-surenos-cartel">Mexico drug cartel</a> in the Guardian:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mexico&#8217;s main crossing point to the US has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/05/brazilian-immigrants-gunned-down-mexico">always had a seedy border vibe</a>, <strong>but two decades ago it was envisaged as a showcase </strong>for a new economy built on free trade, manufacturing and cheap labour.</p>
<p>Factories drew migrants from all over Mexico but low wages kept families poor and often forced both parents to work, leaving children unsupervised. Secondary schools barely functioned, leading to a 50% drop-out rate. Today cartels and gangs find easy recruits amid the 50,000 ni nis, teenagers who neither study nor work. (bolding is mine)</p></blockquote>
<p>The poverty in Juarez, the slave wages were brought about by NAFTA.  Juarez is not only a violent drug town, it is also NAFTA heaven&#8230; As this article <a target="_blank" href="http://dieoff.org/page77.htm">Die off</a>: explains the hellhole for those who work there; a money maker for all the companies that outsourced:<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>There are a total of 350 foreign-owned factories in Juarez, the highest concentration in all of Mexico, and they employ 150,000 workers. <strong>The twin plant system-in Spanish, rnaquiladoras</strong>-was created by the United States and Mexico in 1965 so that Americans could exploit cheap Mexican labor and yet not pay high Mexican tariffs. <br />&#8230;<br />When I practically drill the actual wages into someone&#8217;s head when discussing the issue, he or she will counter by saying that the cost of living is much cheaper in Mexico. <em>This is not true</em>. Along the border, Mexican prices on average run at 90 percent of U.S. prices. Basically, the only cheap thing in Mexico is flesh, human bodies you can fornicate with or work to death. What is happening in Mexico betrays our notion of progress, and for that reason we insist that each ugly little statistic is an exception or temporary or untrue. For example, in the past two years wages (2) in the maquiladoras have risen 50 percent. Fine and good. But inflation in that period is well over 100 percent.<br />&#8230;<br />Juarez is an exhibit of the fabled New World Order in which capital moves easily and labor is trapped by borders. There are a total of 350 foreign-owned factories in Juarez, the highest concentration in all of Mexico, and they employ 150,000 workers. The twin plant system-in Spanish, rnaquiladoras-was created by the United States and Mexico in 1965 so that Americans could exploit cheap Mexican labor and yet not pay high Mexican tariffs. Although the products that come from the factories are counted as exports (and thus figured into GDP), economists figure that only 2 percent of material inputs used in maquila production come from Mexican suppliers. All the parts are shipped to Mexico from the United States and other countries, then the Mexicans assemble them and ship them back. Two or three thousand American managers commute back and forth from El Paso every day<br />&#8230;<br />Workers who lose their jobs receive essentially no benefits beyond severance pay. Mexico has no safety net. Independent, worker-controlled unions barely exist, and anyone trying to organize one is fired, or murdered. (3) It is almost impossible to get ahead working in the maquilas. Real wages have been falling since the 1970s. And since wages are just a hair above starvation level, maquilas contribute practically nothing toward forging a consumer society. Of course, as maquiladora owners and managers point out, if wages are raised, the factories will move to other countries with a cheaper labor force.</p>
<p>And so industry is thriving. Half a million cargo-laden trucks move from Juarez to El Paso each year. Boxcars rumble over the railroad bridge. New industrial parks are opening up. Labor is virtually limitless, as tens of thousands of poverty-stricken people pour into the city each year. </p>
<p>There are few environmental controls and little enforcement of those that do exist. El Paso/Juarez is one of the most polluted spots in North America. And yet it is a success story. In Juarez the economic growth in 1994 it was 6 percent, and last year it registered 12 percent. </p>
<p>According to Lucinda Vargas, the Federal Reserve economist who tracks Mexico&#8217;s economy, Juarez is a &#8220;mature&#8221; economy. This is as good as it gets. With the passage of NAFTA, narcotraficantes began buying maquiladoras in Juarez. They didn&#8217;t want to miss out on the advantages of free trade.<br />&#8230;<br />In 1991, Nicholas Scheele, the head of the Ford Motor Company in Mexico, said in admiration of the government&#8217;s control, &#8220;But is there any other country in the world where the working class . . . took a hit in their purchasing power of in excess of 50 percent over an eight-year period and you didn&#8217;t have a social revolution?&#8221; Maybe you get something you don&#8217;t have to define as a revolution. There are over 200 gangs in Juarez.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ok…now who is responsible for conditions in Juarez?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_25/b4183009392434.htm">Business week</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mexico&#8217;s Ciudad Juárez is one of the most violent places on earth. Drug gangs fight endless battles with each other and police in the streets and alleys of Juárez&#8217; poorest neighborhoods. In the past 28 months this city of 1.5 million, across the Rio Grande from El Paso, has recorded 5,200 murders. </p>
<p>Even though Juárez is the center of Mexico&#8217;s war on drug dealers, it&#8217;s holding its own as the center of maquiladoras, the special zones Mexico developed 30 years ago to attract investment. &#8220;It&#8217;s a dual reality,&#8221; explains Bob Cook, president of the El Paso Regional Economic Development Corp., a group that encourages multinationals to invest on both sides of the border. </p>
<p>In return for building factories in the <strong>maquiladoras</strong>, multinationals get favorable tax treatment, pay low wages (sometimes as low as $4.21 a day)….(Dan here&#8230;and location, freedom from paying for schools and such, in gated industrial parks)<br />&#8230;<br />Blue chips like Johnson &#038; Johnson (JNJ), Delphi Automotive, and Scientific Atlanta show no signs of leaving. El Diario, the local daily, is filled with help-wanted ads from Lear (LEA), Delphi, Siemens (SIE), and other companies.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>There is a great deal of chatter these days about how Obama lost &#8216;Progressives&#8217;, what Robert Gibbs derisively called the &#8216;Professional Left&#8217; or the &#8216;Left of the Left&#8217;, and as an example you could read this from Peter Daou <a target="_blank" href="http://peterdaou.com/2010/09/liberal-bloggers-are-bringing-down-the-obama-presidency/">How a handful of liberal bloggers are bringing down the Obama presidency</a> and the following key graph:<br />
<blockquote>With each passing day, I’m beginning to realize that the crux of the problem for Obama is a handful of prominent progressive bloggers, among them Glenn Greenwald, John Aravosis, Digby, Marcy Wheeler and Jane Hamsher*.<br />Virtually all the liberal bloggers who have taken a critical stance toward the administration have one thing in common: they place principle above party. Their complaints are exactly the same complaints they lodged against the Bush administration. Contrary to the straw man posed by Obama supporters, they aren’t complaining about pie in the sky wishes but about tangible acts and omissions, from Gitmo to Afghanistan to the environment to gay rights to secrecy and executive power.</p></blockquote>
<p> But a couple of things stand out here. First this is an awfully self-referential list, Digby aside it is pretty much the core of the Purity Party who were never on-board the Obama bandwagon to start with. Again Digby partially aside, these people are the modern descendants of the New Left which formed itself explicitly against the Old Liberals and organized itself around topics and principles pretty peripheral to the New Dealers and New Frontier types, anti-colonialism, the Green movement, gay rights all would have been acknowledged as important in principle, but not central. In particular you could be a straight down the line ADA Liberal without endorsing extreme environmentalism or Liberation Theology or marriage equality, there was nothing odd about a midwestern urban Catholic union worker liberal who rejected them all. That is the co-option of Progressive/New Left/Purity Party term of the term &#8216;liberal&#8217; in the way Daou explicitly does here is to me off the mark, most of these people don&#8217;t meet the classic definition of &#8216;Liberal&#8217; to start with.</p>
<p>But there is I think no doubt that Obama came into office with both New Dealers and New Democrats in his corner even as the Progressives Hamsher et al were already leery, and that we can identify what  I am calling the Spitting (sic) moment that split the former two groups and mostly left the first group on the outside. And while the realities of politics today may never have allowed Obama to satisfy the FirePups entirely, the choice to alienate the New Dealers was freely made in the summer of 2009, Obama had a chance to reform the New Deal Coalition and even to drag Progressives along with him (as FDR did in the thirties,) but frankly he blew it, and badly. And the decision point was&#8212;-? To be discussed under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />First the preliminary action. In the immediate wake of the 2008 election House Democrats made an immense move, they outsted John Dingell as Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Chairman and replaced him with Henry Waxman, the latter being thought better able to shape and put through the Obama environmental and energy policies, an area in which Dingell, diehard supporter of Detroit and its auto industry, had been a drag for decades. In return Dingell got thrown a big juicy bone, he retained ownership of his signature issue, one he had introduced legislation on for fifty plus years, and continuing a legacy his father had begun even earlier, Universal Health Care. Specifically he was tasked with being lead author of a bill to be considered by all three committees with jurisdiction: Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and Education and Labor. And in due course what would be known informally as the Tri-Committee Bill and by number HR3200 was introduced to all three Committees on July 14th <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/7/14/753349/-House-Tri-Committee-Healthcare-Reform-Bill-Introduced-Today">House Tri-Committee Healthcare Reform Bill Introduced Today</a></p>
<p>In the meantime the Senate HELP Committee at first under the daily leadership of Dingell&#8217;s comrade in arms Ted Kennedy (who had spent almost as many decades pushing health care as Dingell and who in the previous Congress(es) had introduced what was known as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pnhp.org/news/2007/april/kennedydingell_medi.php">Kennedy Dingell: Medicare for All</a>) and then after Kennedy&#8217;s health slipped under the leadership of  his number two at HELP Chris Dodd worked away to put forth their own version <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/kennedy-dodd-help-bill-with-cbo-scoring.html">Affordable Health Choices Act</a>.</p>
<p>Before the end of the month HR3200 had been passed through the House Tri-Committees, although with some modifications to satisfy Blue Dogs on Energy and Commerce and AHCA had been approved by Senate HELP though watered down at the insistence of  Senate moderates with the following end result:<br />
<blockquote>House Tri-Committee: Ten year addition to budget $1.082 trillion. Total coverage non-elderly: 94%. Coverage for legal non-elderly: 97%<br />Senate HELP: Ten year addition to deficit: $597 billion. Total coverage non-elderly 88%. Coverage for legal non-elderly 90%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now in comparing the two bills a few things stuck out. One although the bills were clearly the work product of Dingell on the House side and Kennedy on the Senate side neither final product had much resemblance to the previous Congress&#8217;s Kennedy-Dingell Medicare for All, instead both bills met Obama&#8217;s campaign promise that if Americans liked what they had, they could keep it, which meant preserving the role for private insurers in the system. Two each bill included a robust public option, also part of Obama&#8217;s platform. Three each already came pre-compromised with the moderates in both parties, particularly Senate HELP. And four, and most important, the HELP Bill was missing huge chunks. Where the Tri-Committees were able to work across jurisdictional lines, each presumedly taking the lead on the section under the jurisdiction of each of the three, Senate HELP did not have jurisdiction over either the Medicare or revenue components, both under the jurisdiction of Senate Finance. Which brings us to the decision point:</p>
<p>Senate Finance Committee Baucus bucked. Instead of merging the appropriate pieces of the Tri-Committee and HELP Bills and then appending his version of the Medicare and funding parts, he simply asserted ownership of the entire bill. Nope he would just  scrap EVERYTHING and craft his own version from scratch. What is more he would do this NOT under regular Committee order where the Senate Finance Sub-Committee on Health Care and its Chairman Rockefeller would have a major voice, but instead form a working group that would move direct to  a final deal on his terms. In effect he spit right in the face of both Dingell and Kennedy, tough shit that they had spent a combined 100 years on this and that Kennedy was clearly in his last months of life, this was going to be the Baucus Bill or maybe the Baucus-Grassley Bill. And with a third mouthful he spat right in the face of Rockefeller and by extension all Democratic progressives and liberals, this bill would be shaped by what was originally a Gang of Seven that included four Republicans and then when Hatch dropped out by a Gang of Six evenly split between the parties and expressly sidelining anyone to left of center. Instead HCR would be shaped by two Conservadems, one moderate Dem, two Conservative Republicans, and one moderate Dem. I discussed the make-up of the Gang of Six in this post from July 29, 2009 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/was-it-gang-of-seven.html">Was it a Gang of Seven</a>. Note that it doesn&#8217;t just flout the concept of majority rule, and ignores the ideological makeup of the Democratic caucus, it systematically excludes the interests of large and/or coastal and/or urban States.</p>
<p>It was a straight out power grab by Baucus. And out of some bizarre desire for Senate Comity above all things (Reid) or an equally bizarre belief in accomplishing some mythical, mystical Post-Partisanship (Obama) the Majority Leader of the Senate and the President of the U.S. simply turned over the keys to the HCR  car to a guy representing less than 1/3rd of 1% of the American population. Which if it had worked would have been okay, although you can bet the final product would have been a lot crappier from a liberal perspective than either HR3200 or Senate HELP, but it didn&#8217;t, instead the Committee deadlocked for almost half a year forcing first Baucus and then Reid  to produce their own versions just in time to get bogged down by the Christmas Holidays. What had been at the introduction of the Tri-Committee Bill and Senate HELP a one month process to be finished prior to the August 2009 recess instead dragged into the next year and  with it sucked all of the enthusiasm out of the New Deal faction of the Democratic Party. A group who had spent much of that late Summer and Fall defending the Obama Administration against the Purity Party Progressives, surely in the end he wouldn&#8217;t just  sell us out!</p>
<p>But Obama did. And along the way showed additional contempt for Liberals by agreeing to a Catfood Commission almost  as loaded to the center-right and right as the Gang of Six, and seemingly devoted to tearing away the centerpiece of the New Deal in the name of Social Security &#8216;Reform&#8217; and &#8216;Fiscal Responsibility&#8217;. The only thing lacking was a &#8216;No Dogs, Irishmen or New Dealers&#8217; sign on the South Lawn. How do you get the New Dealers back on board? How do you close the Enthusiasm Gap among those who were among your biggest boosters and defenders during the HCR fiasco? How about stop pissing on FDR&#8217;s grave and telling us you are just watering the flowers?</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/green_investing/Articles/2658901/Looming-Water-Shortages-Create-Wave-of-Blue-Investing.html">Institutional Investor</a> reminds us of a vital area not in the news, but drawing enough committed money to attract even hedge funds.</p>
<p>Angry Bear has carried posts on the 1989 experiment with privatization of water utilities in Britain, the strange world of WTO rules regarding water supply, ownership, and provision of sewerage, and the big companies involved in development of water (European owned)resources. Ignored in the US media for a few years now that US drought (2007) doesn&#8217;t demand attention, the issues will be coming back to domestic attention as money chases profits.</p>
<p>Since water is a central part of living, perhaps we will pay attention again. </p>
<blockquote><p>The world is getting thirstier. The World Bank estimates that global water consumption will increase by 50 percent over the next 30 years. But the planet has no more water today than it did after the Big Bang, and as with any commodity that appears to be running out, this resource is attracting new interest from investors. </p>
<p>No fewer than eight exchange-traded funds now specialize in water-related investments. The endowments of Harvard University and Duke University have both begun to focus on water. And last year the California Public Employees’ Retirement System committed $260 million to the venture capital firm of one of Sun Microsystems’ co-founders, Vinod Khosla. The firm seeks out emerging water technologies, among other cutting-edge investments. </p>
<p>The market worldwide in stocks revolving around water infrastructure alone — everything from pipes, valves and filters to desalination systems — is thought to be between $550 billion and $700 billion (about $135 billion of that is in the U.S.). William Brennan, a portfolio manager for Summit Global Management, a $450 million-in-assets San Diego–based firm that has a water hedge fund as well as a water-rights fund — a private investment pool that invests in water rights — estimates that the public market could easily grow to $1 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Institutional investors have so far poured $25 billion into water-linked stocks, typically those of water utilities and water-treatment plants. The water industry’s need for funding is so great that it ranks as the fourth most capital-intensive business globally. But U.S. investors are relative newcomers to so-called blue investing. </p></blockquote>
