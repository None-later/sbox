                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>AB readers – endure me for a moment as I have an opportunity to capture some of the dumbest arguments for privatization of Social Security by referring to a single blogger who refuses to let us comment at his blog (I guess his team has zero members) even as he proves his arrogant idiocy routinely here.  OK, you have figured out already I’m referring to Patrick R. Sullivan aka <a href="http://flyunderthebridge.blogspot.com/2006/12/overestimating-angry-bears.html">Roland Patrick</a>:<br />
<blockquote>the claimants to Phd&#8217;s in economics don&#8217;t understand time horizons and their effect on risk/return ratios</p></blockquote>
<p>Read all his meaningless ramblings if you will but this troll does not understand that “risk” has different meanings with the appropriate measure for this discussion being captured by Paul Samuelson in his 1963 Scientia paper entitles “Risk and Uncertainty: A Fallacy of Large numbers” which can be found <a href="http://www.casact.org/dare/index.cfm?fuseaction=view&#038;abstrID=3467">here</a>  and his 1969 The Review of Economics and Statistics paper, <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0034-6535%28196908%2951%3A3%3C239%3ALPSBDS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-6&#038;origin=repec">Lifetime Portfolio Selection By Dynamic Stochastic Programming</a>.  </p>
<p>But then we know Patrick has never read a real discussion of financial economics.  How do we know?  Well, let’s start with his claim that the government bonds in the Trust Fund offer a lower return than those government bonds you and I purchase.  Why?  Because they pay an interest rate determined by government fiat?  Well – it’s interesting to know that if the Trust Fund were given a long-term government bond today, its coupon rate would be around 4.7%, which is the coupon rate we were offered – and this is by design.</p>
<p>Patrick has a natural counter, which is essentially default risk.  Never mind that the Trust Fund’s projections have plenty of resources on paper for the next two generations.  You see – the Trust Fund buys essentially the same financial instruments that the General Fund deficits are rapidly making worthless.  OK, Patrick supports the Bush fiscal policies that have led to these General Fund deficits, but we are not supposed to notice this inconsistency.  And Patrick adds that we can’t cash in Trust Fund bonds because of trading restrictions.  Is this some astute point as those who privately hold Federal bonds can trade them in?  Well, let’s think about how market prices respond to default risk.  Oh yea, the market prices of long-term bonds would fall, which would mean that their yields would be higher.  So let’s check with the reporting of market rates from the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update">Federal Reserve</a>.  One would think that long-term rates on Federal bonds would be substantially higher than short-term rates under Patrick Sullivan’s little hypothesis.  However, short-term rates are near 5%, while long-term rates are around 4.7% to 4.8%.  So is there a default premium?  Guess not.  Maybe Patrick thinks those who trade in the bond market are not as “smart” as he is.  </p>
<p>If you think otherwise, which would you prefer Patrick to do first, open his blog to comments or go buy a decent Finance of Dummies book?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/is-there-adjustment-without-saving.html">Steve Kyle</a> is off to a superb start as an Angrybear:<br />
<blockquote>My rationale was that if the US continues to spend more than it produces then the Current Account will remain in deficit and while an increase in the value of the yuan could help (by reducing our real income and/or by shifting demand to other goods, some of which are domestic and some from other countries) it can’t be expected to correct the huge underlying imbalances in income vs. spending that drive our deficits.</p></blockquote>
<p>As AB readers likely know, I’ve touted the Mundellian argument that fiscal restraint could lead to an exactly offsetting increase in net exports if we let the dollar devalue.  Steve’s post has attracted the attention of Dean Baker in part because he linked to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/12/false_fears_of_protectionism_o.html#014823">this discussion</a>.  Dean reminds me that we might be under a Bretton Woods II regime whereas my Mundellian logic relies on floating rates.   But it was this line from Dean that got me thinking – which variable (national savings rate v. exchange rate) is the cause and which is the effect:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s also worth notiing that China&#8217;s currency policy has been one of the main factors lowering the U.S. savings rate. China&#8217;s central bank has bought hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. treasury bonds. This has kept long-term interest rates extraordinarily low, which in turn has fueled the housing bubble. The unprecedented run-up in housing prices has allowed people to borrow against their homes at an incredible pace, giving us the first negative savings rate since the depression. While the Fed deserves blame for not trying to counteract this effect and acting to burst the bubble, China&#8217;s policies are a major factor behind the record low U.S. savings rate.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Touche!</strong></em>  <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/12/bernanke-to-china-stop-saving.html">Greg Mankiw</a> points us to a related discussion from <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2006/20061215/default.htm">Ben Bernanke</a> where Chairman Ben wants the Chinese to save less.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/12/bernanke_pegged.html">Mark Thoma</a> picks up on where Chairman Ben suggested an overvalued yuan is effectively an export subsidy.  </p>

<blockquote>Yes, Greg is quoting a NYTimes that we discussed this morning and yes it is technically true &#8211; if one does not consider the latest news from the BLS that nominal wage growth was only 2% on an annualized basis last month. We’ll have to wait to see how much the CPI rose. If real wages dip even by the slightest amount, then real wage growth from November 2003 to November 2006 will have been ZERO. Not exactly commensurate with the real wage growth</p></blockquote>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics released its estimate of CPI inflation for the month of November and it was zero.  So now we can compare the real average hourly wage for workers below management level for November 2006 to that of November 2003.  In 1982$, the latter was $8.31 and the most recently reported real wage was $8.34.  So real wages have increased by 0.36% over the past three years.</p>

                                <p>The <country-region st="on">US</country-region> says <country-region st="on"><place st="on">China</place></country-region> should let the yuan float upward.  The Chinese say the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">US</place></country-region> should save more.  The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/business/worldbusiness/14trade.html?ex=1323752400&#038;en=c7a134c527178bca&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">NY Times </a> reports these positions uncritically but who is right?  I have argued before that revaluing the yuan cannot by itself cure our problems  (See  <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9D%3Ca">paulson-goes-to-china</a> on 12/13 in the archives for AB).  My rationale was that if the US continues to spend more than it produces then the Current Account will remain in deficit and while an increase in the value of the yuan could help (by reducing our real income and/or by shifting demand to other goods, some of which are domestic and some from other countries) it can’t be expected to correct the huge underlying imbalances in income vs. spending that drive our deficits.   <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/">Dean Baker </a>in his blog on the American Prospect says &#8220;a higher savings rate will only reduce the trade deficit if it leads to a recession or at least substantially slower growth.  This seems to imply that higher savings is not the route to adjustment or at least that there is some preferable alternative.  Which view is correct?</p>
<p>In my opinion, both are.  It is hard to imagine a “post-adjustment” world where there is not both a higher yuan and a <place st="on"><country-region st="on">US</country-region></place> where there are lower deficits (i.e. more saving, probably on the part of both the government and the private sector).  The reason for this is explained in my previous post but boils down to the standard result that if you have two targets (internal and external balance) then you need at least two policies to get there (in this case the exchange rate and the spending/income balance).  I stand by this conclusion but the question remains as to whether we can get there without a recession.</p>
<p>My answer:  In theory yes, but the probability of achieving that decreases the longer we wait.  Essentially, there are two ways to close the gap between income and spending – We can spend less or we can produce more.  It is far more pleasant to do the latter – produce more – than it is to do the former but there is a big difference between them that matters a lot for adjustment.   Producing more (and in this case especially producing more traded goods, either exports or import replacements) takes a lot longer to achieve than does spending less – which can be done fairly instantly, at least in political terms.  </p>
<p>So that is our conundrum:  If we want to produce more then we need to orient our spending toward productive ends rather than consumption and non-productive capital such as housing.  If we don’t then whenever our various creditors get tired of gorging themselves on our paper we will see a very sharp adjustment wherein our exchange rate will tank, interest rates will spike, and spending on things which are sensitive to those two variables will be forcibly curtailed through much higher prices.  Another name for this is a recession.</p>
<p>Is there a way to engineer a soft landing?  Yes, and we have done it before.  In the past when similar issues arose we joined with our major trading partners in the Plaza and Louvre accords to jointly and simultaneously make the unpleasant adjustments that would lead to a benign outcome compared to a go-it-alone-until-the-markets-rebel outcome.  But those two agreements required two things which are currently in short supply:  First is the willingness on the part of the US government to recognize the problem and lead by example in making the sacrifices and compromises necessary to bring the rest of the world along and second is a level of trust on the part of our partners that we will play fair and do our part.</p>
<p>On the first point I am completely pessimistic.  The current Administration can’t even admit personal responsibility for anything much less national responsibility for economic adjustment.  And on the second point, who would trust the Bush Administration now?  They have a well established international record of mendacity, and even if they didn’t the divided government in <state st="on"><place st="on">Washington</place></state> and the lame duck status of Bush make bipartisan agreement on anything more of a wish than a probability.</p>
<p>So the outcome is:  steady as she goes, and trust to luck to sort things out.  On the bright side, luck isn’t out of the question.  There is a lot of inertia in our economic system and there are indeed self-correcting tendencies.  But I would rather do what we can to help things along rather than just hope everything turns out OK.  Meanwhile, my advice is to do what I have done:  stay out of debt and buy euros.</p>

                                <p>If you’ve been reading this blog for a while, and spend time in the comments to the post, what follows might be familiar to you.  I remember posting bits and pieces of it in comments to posts by PGL and Angry Bear back before I wheedled my way into their midst.  </p>
<p>I believe in a progressive tax system.  I believe in a progressive tax system because I believe in capitalism.  Capitalism is based on the idea that resources flow toward those who have the greatest marginal use for them, not through government edict, but through the Invisible Hand of the market.  If I build a better mousetrap, under ideal circumstances, mouse-trap connoisseurs will flock to me, giving me money and hence encouraging me to build more of the same.  It will also encourage others to innovate and build even better mouse-traps.  The flip side of this is that those who benefit the most from something – in this example purchasers of fancy mouse-traps – will pay the most for that service.</p>
<p>Adam Smith went a step further – he pointed out that when it all works, capitalism is the ideal system because in allocating resources in this manner, the market is actually allocating resources in the manner that most benefits society as a whole.  </p>
<p>(Of course, it doesn’t always work that way – information is not always perfect, externalities abound, crime is rampant, market power creates its own distortions, and of course, there is also fraud and other crime to wreak havoc in the market.)</p>
<p>And while the government operates outside the market in many ways, under ideal circumstances, government services should be provided and paid for as much as possible using the same approach as private services – those who benefit the most should pay the most.  What are the services the government provides?  Ideally, at a minimum, it sets rules and enforces them and protects the country from foreign invasion (e.g., the Canadian hordes).  In plain English, the government is responsible for ensuring that society doesn’t break down.  Oliver Wendell Holmes put it better:  “Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society”  If government goes away, you have Somalia.  </p>
<p>So who benefits the most from the existence of government?  At first glance, one might say the poor.  After all, in many instances, they receive transfers from the government.  Perhaps in a free-for-all, the rich would simply let them starve.</p>
<p>But a second glance gives you a different set of winners and losers.  Consider a janitor who lives in downtown LA, and an investment banker who lives in Bel-Air.  The government provides a lot of services to the investment banker that are not used by the janitor.  For instance, it prevents the janitor from driving off in the banker’s vehicles.  (It doesn’t need to prevent the banker from driving off in the janitor’s vehicles, if any.)  In fact, the government is the first line of defense for most of the investment banker’s property, as most of it is held in intangible form; bank accounts, stock certificates, etc., only have value as long as society is maintained.  Now you might say – well, even if the government disappears, Bank of America will maintain the value of its clients’ accounts.  Sure, they’ll have an incentive to do so, but what ensures that every programmer who now works for Bank of America doesn’t simply steal from B of A clients is fear of jail, which means, the government.  </p>
<p>The janitor has no shares of stock, and maybe a couple of hundred bucks in the bank.  Most of his property is physical and sitting in his rented apartment; he (and a baseball bat) is the first line of defense for his own property.</p>
<p>Well, the stockbroker has physical property too.  What about the boat he keeps at Marina del Rey, or the second home in Aspen?  Again, those (or his ownership of those) are defended primarily by the government – he and his baseball bat are located too far away to keep out interlopers.  Sure, he might pay private security to watch those items, but if government ceases to exist, the $10 an hour rent-a-cops (not the security companies, the employees) will be living in his second home and his yacht.  Heck, they’d probably chuck him from his Bel-Air home while they’re at it.  Nobody’s going to steal the janitor’s apartment; first, because it isn’t his (he rents it), and second, why steal from a poor man when you can steal from a rich one more easily?</p>
<p>And so far all I’ve written about is protection.  This could be a really long post, and I could write point out other ways those at the top benefit more than those at the bottom.  As an example &#8211; anyone think the janitor has more political power and access to elected officials than the investment banker, and anyone think power and access doesn’t buy you something?</p>
<p>In any case, the services one gets from the government increase with one’s assets.  But these services increase more and more rapidly as one’s assets increase.  (With protection – the more wealth you have, the more of that wealth is in intangible form or, if physical, not something to whose defense one can contribute.)  In a fair and capitalist system, therefore, taxes should increase with wealth, and they should be progressive, increasing proportionally to the services provided by the government.  Now, we don’t tax based on wealth, but rather on income that is a proxy (however poor) for wealth.  </p>
<p>I note that the Bible of capitalism, Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations, says <a href="http://www.adamsmith.org/smith/won/won-b5-c2-article-1-ss3.html">the same thing</a>:  “It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.”  In other words… Smith felt that the tax system should be progressive.</p>
<p>(As an aside:  Its possible you clicked on the link, scratched your head, reached for your well-worn copy on the bookshelf, thumbed through it, and said to yourself – but how does this quote come from Book 5 of the Wealth of Nations when there are only three books?  Well, it turns out that the copy you have, bought at the bookstore, is a bit short.  See, the folks who love to quote Adam Smith, and who call themselves capitalist – the ones who work at Cato or Heritage – they only like what’s in the first three books.  Booksellers cater to book buyers, so your copy only has the first three books.  More on some of what Adam Smith was about courtesy of <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/09/the_many_faces_.html">Mark Thoma</a>.)</p>

                                <p>In his update to the income inequality debate <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/income-inequality-and-consumption-gap.html">yesterday</a>, <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/12/inequality-wars.html">Greg Mankiw</a> wrote:<br />
<blockquote>Another piece of this puzzle is a paper by Kopczuk and Saez on wealth inequality. They find (see figures 2 and 5) that wealth concentration has not changed much over the past half century (although their data end in 2000), and it is nowhere near the levels experienced in the 1920s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since I have been <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/does-income-inequality-lead-to.html">referring</a> referring to <a href="http://fmww.bc.edu/EC-P/WP629.pdf">this paper</a> as evidence of widening wealth inequality (see their figure 8 which simulates their model’s implied Gini index for wealth inequality), I was sort of surprised by this so I checked out what <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w10399">Wojciech Kopczuk and Emmanuel Saez</a> <br />
<blockquote>This paper presents new homogeneous series on top wealth shares from 1916 to 2000 in the United States using estate tax return data. Top wealth shares were very high at the beginning of the period but have been hit sharply by the Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II shocks. Those shocks have had permanent effects. Following a decline in the 1970s, top wealth shares recovered in the early 1980s, but they are still much lower in 2000 than in the early decades of the century.</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors were not only comparing 2000 to 1916, while other research look at periods from say the 1960’s to 2000 (or later), the authors were not trying to capture all percentiles – just the ones towards the upper end.  </p>
<p>So I was wondering what other research on wealth inequality might be available.  <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/webfeatures_snapshots_20060823"> Sylvia Allegretto</a> of the Economic Policy Institute offers:<br />
<blockquote>The figure is one such measure of inequality &#8211; the ratio of the wealth of the richest 1% to that of a household with typical wealth in the middle. As the figure indicates, wealth inequality has not only persisted, but also grown much larger over time. The richest 1% of wealth holders had 125 times the wealth of the typical household in 1962; by 2004 they had 190 times as much or $14.8 million in wealth for the upper 1% compared to just $82,000 for the household in the middle fifth of wealth.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, our friends on the left have one narrow statistic that says wealth inequality is soaring, but to be fair – this does not capture the distribution either.  So check out <a href="http://www.chicagofed.org/publications/workingpapers/wp2005_10.pdf">Marco Cagetti and Mariacristina De Nardi</a> from the Chicago Federal Reserve.  They examine the entire distribution from 1989 to 2001 noting how uneven the distribution of wealth is.  But is inequality rising?  Their table 1 shows “Percent of net worth held by various groups defined in terms of percentiles of the wealth distribution” with the top 5% seeing an increase from 54.4% to 57.7%.  The bottom had seen an increase in their small share from 1989 to 1995, but this has reversed itself.  The share of wealth from the median to the 95th percentile eroded over this period.  The authors also note the difficulty of measuring wealth inequality in the past but point to the findings of other literature:<br />
<blockquote>There is evidence that U.S. wealth inequality decreased significantly between the 1920 and the 1970s … Inequality increased again in the 1980s.  Wolfe argues that while wealth inequality fell during the 1970s, it rose sharply after 1979, with a dramatic increase over the 1980s, to the level of in the 1990s. The trend in the 1990s is much less clear.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps my favorite paper on this topic comes from <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/wpa/wuwpma/0402012.html">James P. Smith</a> who not only documents the rise in wealth inequality but also asks <em>Why is Wealth Inequality Rising?</em><br />
<blockquote>This paper summarizes the principal facts about wealth inequality and how it has been changing during the last fifteen years. A very sharp rise in the inequality in household wealth has taken place at least since the mid-1980s. I first examine the relation between wealth and income by illustrating how wealth is distributed within and across income groups and then attempt to uncover some reasons why wealth inequality has been expanding so rapidly. The reasons examined include the receipt of inheritances, rising income inequality, and capital gains, particularly those due to appreciation in equity markets. The subsequent impact of these capital gains on financial savings in other forms is also investigated. Two of the possible explanations&#8211;the receipt of inheritances and the uneven savings generated by the simultaneous rise in income inequality&#8211;were rejected as likely to be quantitatively unimportant. The principal culprit lies instead in the third reason: the uneven receipt both within and across income classes of capital gains, particularly those due to sharp price appreciation in equity markets. Capital gains in stocks then induced households to reduce their financial savings in other assets and therefore may have contributed to the recent secular decline in household savings. Throughout, this research relies on two longitudinal surveys that have pioneered the incorporation of household wealth modules into multipurpose social science surveys: the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS).</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://nrd.nationalreview.com/article/?q=ZDdiZjFiOGRhZmU5MTRiNjkxZTgxNDRmZWRmZWY1Zjk=">Kevin</a> <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MjE1YjlhNmU3ZmZiMGQ0ZWM0ZTI4NTY2MzM3YjhhZTM=">Hassett</a> (aided by  Aparna Mathur) is having a debate with the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/opinion/12tue2.html?_r=1&#038;n=Top%2FOpinion%2FEditorials%20and%20Op-Ed%2FEditorials&#038;oref=slogin">NYTimes</a> on the income inequality issue.   When Kevin writes:<br />
<blockquote>This evidence has always struck us as counterintuitive because the National Income and Product Accounts data tell a story of robust growth in income and consumption.</p></blockquote>
<p>One has to laugh as aggregates tell us nothing about the distribution of either income or consumption.  So what is Kevin trying to say here?  Is he arguing that a shift of income away from poor folks towards rich folks would have lowered consumption relative to income?  Then he is making the argument that the marginal propensity to consume for rich folks is lower than it is for poor folks.  But does Kevin reject the Ando-Modigliani life cycle model, which is essentially the same as the Friedman permanent income hypothesis?  Stay tuned.</p>
<p>But Kevin also noted:<br />
<blockquote>The Department of Labor’s Consumer Expenditure Survey provides detailed consumption data on a cross section of Americans; we can use this to estimate how much of our aggregate consumption went to each income group in recent years. These data reveal that the middle class has been doing pretty well for itself. Breaking the income distribution up into five quintiles, we tracked the consumption experience of the middle quintile (or middle class) in recent years … the real growth rate of consumption for the middle class between 2000 and 2005 was about 7.5 percent. So the welfare of the middle is improving, and unambiguously. There is nothing to debate. The strong economy is lifting all boats.</p></blockquote>
<p>So consumption for one of the quintiles was 7.5% higher in real terms in 2005 than it was in 2000.  A little perspective please.  Real GDP rose by 12.5% over this period and the share of aggregate GDP <em>that was consumed</em> (thanks marcel) rose from 68.65% in 2000 to 70.19% in 2005.  Consumption as a share of income may have increased because folks were silly enough to believe that George W. Bush was giving us our money back.  Of course, these tax “cuts” were only tax shifts or deferrals, so the Barro-Ricardian Equivalence version of the life cycle model would have to wonder why folks were not saving for those future tax bills (more on this later).  We should also note that the population rose by 5% over this period – so I have a question for Kevin. Is your 7.5% increase referring to aggregate consumption or consumption per capita?  Let’s see how he started his discussion:<br />
<blockquote>When George W. Bush took office in January 2001, the economy was producing roughly $10 trillion worth of output annually. This year, it looks like production will be in the neighborhood of $13.5 trillion. If we think of our nation’s GDP as analogous to an individual’s income, then that lucky fellow has seen his income increase over the past six years by about 35 percent. A person making $100,000 who saw the same increase in his income would now be making $135,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, no, no, no.  Aggregate nominal increases in GDP are not the same as the increase in real per capita GDP.  Kevin Hassett is smart to know this so why does he open his piece with such an obvious misrepresentation?  </p>
<p>We addressed the income inequality v. consumption inequality debate <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/does-income-inequality-lead-to.html">here</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Iacoviello’s model predicts that consumption inequality grows less than proportionally as income inequality grows, while wealth inequality grows more than proportionally. Examining the distribution of current consumption misses the point that living standards should be gauged across individual’s lifetimes. While the very wealthy have ample resources for old age retirement, the evidence suggests that the working poor may not – unless we retain the Social Security Trust Fund as a vehicle to supplement their retirement benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>What I’m trying to say is that it is lifetime consumption that matters.  But then Kevin seems to be saying the same thing:<br />
<blockquote>It also accounts for fluctuation of income over time. Consumption is generally smoothed over time by people to match their expected income. A person’s consumption provides a much more accurate read on how he’s doing than does his before-tax income.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aha!  Kevin does believe in the permanent income hypothesis after all!  So let me see if I understand what he is saying.  Folks in the lower quintile today are really rich people who have temporarily dropped out of the full time labor force, while the Bill Gates crowd is not consuming all of their income because they know they’ll take a few years off in the future.  No – I don’t buy this explanation.  </p>
<p>But as Kevin mentions before-tax v. after-tax income, maybe what he’s addressing is how we will reverse the Bush deficit disaster.  It is reasonable to believe that someone’s future taxes will go up once we have a real leader in the White House.  So is Kevin telling us that the middle class and the poor will keep their modest tax “cuts”, while the rich will have to endure a much more progressive tax code in the future?  No – this is certainly not the Republican game plan.  The few conservatives who are honest enough to admit taxes will have to increase (e.g., Bruce Bartlett and Greg Mankiw) are advocating a less progressive tax system.  Maybe Kevin should tell us what type of tax system he would advocate.  His spin here would make sense only if he believes the tax code will become more progressive.  Is he advocating such a tax policy?</p>

<blockquote>President Bush will soon seek about $100 billion in additional emergency funds for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to a House report Wednesday. Filed by Democratic staffers for two key panels in the House, the report&#8217;s revelations mark a rapid escalation in the cost of the Iraq war at a time when public support is plummeting. In a broad report criticizing Republicans&#8217; fiscal decisions, Democratic staffers on the House Appropriations Committee and House Budget Committee also noted that Congress has already appropriated about $379 billion for the war in Iraq. &#8220;The administration is expected to submit an additional request early next year that will total roughly $100 billion. At least three-quarters of this request will support operations in Iraq,&#8221; according to the report. If the White House asks for the $100 billion, it would be significantly less than the $130 billion the Pentagon requested recently, according to several accounts &#8230; The $100 billion, if submitted and approved by Congress next year, would be in addition to the record $447 billion the Pentagon is receiving this fiscal year for all military operations. The House Democrats&#8217; report, titled &#8220;The Republican Legacy: Bad Budgeting Creates Burdens For Years To Come,&#8221; said that despite significant increases in the Pentagon&#8217;s budget, &#8220;The war in Iraq has left the U.S. Army&#8217;s readiness at its lowest level in decades.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Bad budgeting indeed.  Considering this fiscal year alone, we first hear the cost will be $70 billion and now President Bush says $170 billion, while the Pentagon is saying $200 billion.  And this is not counting what it will take to bring our military back to the readiness before the Iraq invasion. </p>
<p>Back in 2002, Mitch Daniels was saying this would cost only $60 billion, while Bill Kristol put the figure at a much lower level.  Lawrence Lindsey had the courage to disagree with these low-ball estimates for which he got the pink slip.  Look wars are costly – even if the Commander in Chief wants to claim he was giving us our money back.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I mentioned one of my old Professors, Arnold Harberger, a few times in recent posts.  I can be argumentative, and I got into a lot of arguments with him.  As a general rule, when I argued with Harberger, I was wrong.  There is one thing, and one thing only that I can think of that I disagreed with him that to this day I still think I was right about.  So here’s that story…</p>
<p>When I finished my comps, I had a few rudimentary germs of ideas I was considering for thesis topics.  My favorite was a theory of economic development.  I had spent some time thinking about Mexico and Brazil and the United States – each was the flagship, so to speak, of a colonial power, but the first two are charitably described as developing countries, and the last, well, is the United States.  </p>
<p>I also thought about the period from World War 2 onward.  At the end of the war, much of the world was in pitiful shape.  There wasn’t much to differentiate, say, West Germany from East Germany, or Taiwan from China, or South Korea from North Korea, or England or France from Poland or Czechoslovakia.  And Mexico and Brazil were probably in better shape than most, if not all of those countries.  And yet, 50 years later there were definitely winners and losers among those countries.</p>
<p>So what was the difference?  Here’s what I thought…  the difference between Mexico and Brazil and the United States in the 1500s had nothing to do with Mexico, Brazil, and the US, but rather with Spain, Portugal, and England.  Spain and Portugal were dying empires, and they basically looted everything they could, often destorying much that they couldn&#8217;t loot in the process.  England was the most advanced country on earth; it didn’t need anything from the New World, and if anything, there was an outflow of capital (mostly human capital) from England to its colony.  </p>
<p>I also thought a bit about Mexico and Brazil and other countries: South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, West Germany, East Germany, Poland, England and China.  At the end of World War 2, arguably Mexico and Brazil were in better shape than the other countries I mentioned.  South Korea and Taiwan had never been particularly advanced; Japan and West Germany were in ruins.  And yet, 50 years later, Mexico and Brazil were lagging behind South Korea and Taiwan and Japan and West Germany.  Not so much East Germany and Poland.  </p>
<p>What’s the difference?  Well…  the winners were those that the United States effectively colonized.  (And if you don’t think we effectively colonized, say, England, bear in mind there are still US military bases there.  As to Taiwan, they were colonized twice – first, when the Nationalists took everything that wasn’t nailed down in China and much that was to Taiwan, and second, with US participation after Quemoy and Matsu.  South Korea, Japan, and the rest of Western Europe – I think colonization was self-evident.)  In other words, there was an inflow of human capital from the most advanced country on earth.  East Germany and Poland were effectively colonized by an empire that was already dying – there was more of a transfer of capital toward that empire (consider reports of Soviet soldiers stealing toilets from German apartment buildings) than the other way.</p>
<p>Now, what is magical about being colonized by whatever the most advanced country on earth?  Well…  I think it’s a few things.  I would imagine that when a country leads the world, it is generally because it has better institutions and a relative strong economic situation.  And the institutions, along with capital (human and otherwise) get transferred to the colonies.  All of that happened in England and South Korea and so forth, but it did not happen in Mexico or Brazil or Argentina.  (Some wag once called them the MBA countries.)</p>
<p>Note that I am not advocating colonization as a way of development.  (No “Mouse that Roared” scenario here.)  I believe the same effects could be accomplished by copying the institutions from countries that are successful and getting massive infusions of resources.</p>
<p>And yes, I note there are exceptions – places like Luxembourg and the Scandinavian countries – but these seem to have pretty good institutions of their own.  Other exceptions include countries where oil was discovered (but an argument could be made the US effectively colonized, if not Saudi Arabia, at least its economy), or one-off special cases; trading posts like Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p>Anyway, Harberger thought this didn’t make sense, and wasn’t a good topic, so I scratched it off the list of thesis topics.  But it was one of the things about which he didn’t convince me.  And its been over a decade and I still think about this now and then, I still believe there’s something to this.  Your thoughts?  Am I missing something obvious?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Sometimes the data just shows what everyone expects it to show.  I don’t expect many people will be surprised by much in this post, which is on education.</p>
<p>55.5 percent of the US population aged 3 to 34 was enrolled in school in 1965; that figure was 56.2% in 2004, and it reached a low (for the sample) of 47.9% in 1984.  </p>
<p>We often hear that enrollment (especially in college and MBA programs) rises when the job market sucks.  An economist would say this because in a poor job market, the costs (in terms of foregone opportunity) of attending school drop.  Similarly, when the job market is poor, the benefits of attending school may also rise; the added degree may increase one’s likelihood of getting a job more when competition for jobs is extremely fierce than at other times.</p>
<p>But are there other instances in which the benefits of getting more education increase?  Well… yes.  For example, presumably the fewer the numbers of students per teacher, the better the education, on the average.  The table below shows the correlation between the percentage of the population (3 to 34) in school in any given year, and the ratio of students to teachers X years before</p>
<p>Ratio, X years before________correlation<br />1 year___________________-0.07<br />2 years__________________-0.19<br />3 years__________________-0.28<br />4 years__________________-0.34<br />5 years__________________-0.43</p>
<p>The more students per teacher, the lower the enrollment in later years.  (I probably should have gone back a few more years to see when the correlation stops mattering, but I got tired.  Sorry.)</p>
<p>Another measure of the quality of education might be teacher’s pay.  The next table shows the correlation between the percentage of the population (3 to 34) in school in any given year, and the ratio of students to teachers X years before</p>
<p>Ratio, X years before________correlation<br />1 year____________________0.56<br />2 years___________________0.65<br />3 years___________________0.75<br />4 years___________________0.81<br />5 years___________________0.84</p>
<p>The higher the teacher pay, the higher the enrollment in later years.</p>
<p>Conclusion…  on the average, students (or potential students) are rational.  When there are more signs that some of the proxies for education quality are increasing, it leads to greater enrollment in school, all else being equal.  </p>
<p>As always, if anyone wants my spreadsheet, just ask.  </p>
