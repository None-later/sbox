                                <p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/11/17/gulf.war.illness.study/index.html">CNN</a> and many other news services are reporting that:</p>
<blockquote><p> According to the report, Gulf War illness is a &#8220;complex of multiple concurrent symptoms&#8221; that &#8220;typically includes persistent memory and concentration problems, chronic headaches, widespread pain, gastrointestinal problems, and other chronic abnormalities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The illness may also be potentially tied to higher rates of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) &#8212; more commonly known as Lou Gehrig&#8217;s Disease &#8212; among Gulf War veterans than veterans of other conflicts.</p>
<p>The illness is identified as the consequence of multiple &#8220;biological alterations&#8221; affecting the brain and nervous system. iReport.com: Do you know someone affected by Gulf War illness?</p>
<p>While it is sometimes difficult to issue a specific diagnosis of the disease, it is, according to the report, no longer difficult to identify a cause.</p>
<p>The report identifies two Gulf War &#8220;neurotoxic&#8221; exposures that &#8220;are causally associated with Gulf War illness.&#8221; The first is the ingestion of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) pills, given to protect troops from effects of nerve agents. The second is exposure to dangerous pesticides used during the conflict.</p>
<p>The report does not rule out other possible contributors to Gulf War illness &#8212; including low-level exposure to nerve agents and close proximity to oil well fires &#8212; though it fails to establish any clear link.</p>
<p>The report concludes there is no clear link between the illness and a veteran&#8217;s exposure to factors such as depleted uranium or an anthrax vaccine administered at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gulf War illness isn&#8217;t some imaginary syndrome,&#8221; said Ken Robinson, the senior intelligence officer for the initial Department of Defense investigation into Gulf War illness in 1996-97.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is real, and it has devastated families. Now is the time to restore the funding cuts that have been made in the Veterans Administration. Our mission has to be to ensure that these veterans get help and become whole again.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>By Stormy</p>
<p>Trade means jobs; trade brings money into plants; trade surpluses ripple through the economy, providing not only wealth to employers and employees alike but also moneys into public coffers. Consider it &#8220;outside money&#8221; flowing into a town, county, state, or country.</p>
<p>Since the late 1970’s, that kind of “outside money” has not been flowing into public coffers or into the hands of the average worker, dramatically so in the last decade. Recently, our trade deficit has grown almost exponentially.</p>
<p>This trend is coincidental not only with the rise of public and private debt but also with NAFTA and China’s entry into the WTO. That the trade deficit is coincident with globalization itself is no accident. During the last ten years, trade as a percentage of GDP has become sharply and dangerously negative.</p>
<p>The following post examines graphically what has happened since 1960. The four following graphs, based on the Bureau of Economic Research’s “U.S. International Transaction Data” tell a story that is not pleasant. [See <a href="http://www.bea.gov/international/xls/table1.xls">here</a>.] In addition to the aforementioned data, I used the Bureau’s GDP data. [See <a href="http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">here.</a>]</p>
<p>Along with Trade, I look at the sum of three other items in the Current Account section of the Transaction Data: Royalties and License Fees, Income of U.S-owned Assets Abroad, and Transfers under Military Agency Sales. While the trade deficit blossomed, the sum of these last rose dramatically. Unfortunately, they are not offsetting, not by a long shot; but they do tell us a great deal about our priorities.</p>
<p>I have divided the discussion into five parts. Each of the first four includes a graph and discussion of the data. In the fifth, I place that data into the expanding crisis in which we find ourselves.</p>
<p>Net Trade: Exports and Imports of Goods and Services</p>
<p>As the following graph reveals, between 1960 and 1980, the U.S. had a stable balance of trade. After a sharp dip and subsequent rise in the ‘80’s, the trade deficit began its steep downward descent around 1996. NAFTA passed in 1993; China entered the WTO in 2001. Fast track trade rose in importance. The engine of globalization had left the station. Full steam ahead!</p>

<p>Net Trade as Percentage of GDP</p>
<p>The next graph looks at Net Trade (exports + imports) as a percentage of GDP. Again the tale is dramatic.</p>
<p>Prior to 1975, net trade was an important positive contributor to GDP. After a roller coaster ride in the 1980’s, trade became an increasing drag on GDP. That dragged gain impetus from 1996 onwards. In short, beginning in 1983, the trade balances no longer contributed positively to GDP.</p>
<p>Beginning around 1993 net trade as a percentage of GDP began its precipitous descent.</p>
<p>The “outside money” that I mentioned in the first paragraph no longer flowed into public coffers, jobs, and pensions. We had begun our spending spree, spending our accumulated wealth and going deeper and deeper into debt.</p>
<p>Additionally, we were inflating our GDP with the housing bubble. (Real estate comprises maybe ten percent of GDP.) If we could have properly accounted for the housing bubble, we would have made two salient observations:
<ol>
<li>Net Trade as a Percentage of GDP had declined even more precipitously than we thought. </li>
<li>GDP growth during this period may well have been illusory.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SSI5oy7MvBI/AAAAAAAAACY/fV_3CvfyV-w/s1600-h/Net+Imports+Percentage+of+GDP.gif"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SSI5oy7MvBI/AAAAAAAAACY/fV_3CvfyV-w/s400/Net+Imports+Percentage+of+GDP.gif" border="0"></a></p>
<p>But we were happy that we could pay less for goods. Cheaper imported goods helped keep inflation down. Our economic focus was consumer based. Adding jobs to health care and government while losing jobs in manufacturing caused some concern. Stocks were up, however. Everything looked rosy.</p>
<p>Look closely at the difference between 1975 and 2006: Almost 7 percentage points.</p>
<p>Transfers/Royalties/Assets Abroad</p>
<p>The next graph reveals some of the items that played a positive role in net trade, i.e., they are considered part of our exports.
<ol>
<li>Transfers under U.S. military agency sales contracts </li>
<li>Royalties and license fees </li>
<li>Income receipts on U.S.-owned assets abroad.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SSI5etdNjII/AAAAAAAAACQ/34VXPYWVKoo/s1600-h/Miltary+Royalties.gif"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SSI5etdNjII/AAAAAAAAACQ/34VXPYWVKoo/s400/Miltary+Royalties.gif" border="0"></a></p>
<p>From 1972 onward, we see a steady climb in these items; in 2002, they climb sharply upward. All three of these items played a positive role in GDP. Other than military hardware, none of them contribute to well-paying jobs. Surprisingly, royalties and license fees moved from 837 million in 1960 to 5,885 million in 1978, to 30,029 in 1995, and to 82,614 in 2007. That companies have seen this item as a cash cow that can be milked is the reason it has played such a prominent role in trade discussions. This kind of income plays well in corporate headquarters and those lucky ones that have a share in patents.</p>
<p>It could be argued that royalties and licensing fees do buttress job security, but I wonder just how many American jobs are being helped here, especially when we consider Net Trade itself.</p>
<p>Not so surprisingly, receipts from abroad moved from 4,416 million in 1960 to 25,231 million in 1975 to 208,065 million 1995 to 804,807 million in 2007!</p>
<p>Balance on Current Account as a Percentage of GDP</p>
<p>The last and final graph displays the Current Account as a percentage of GDP. (The Current Account includes all export and import categories as well as other items.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SSI5V5f2WHI/AAAAAAAAACI/73FQPfj_6-c/s1600-h/Balance+on+Current+Account+as+Percentage.gif"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SSI5V5f2WHI/AAAAAAAAACI/73FQPfj_6-c/s400/Balance+on+Current+Account+as+Percentage.gif" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The Balance on Current Accounts mirrors Net Trade.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Some will argue that net trade is relatively unimportant, but every time it blips upward, we hear the bright blaring of trumpets, as if the upward rise were somehow important. A positive trade balance is important. That the balance has been negative for almost thirty years should be of great national concern. Yet it has not been.</p>
<p>The rise in housing prices certainly accelerated GDP, as did the use of the home as an ATM machine, as did all that consumer spending—in short, all that activity that contributed to our collective and personal debt. Now the piper has arrived on our shores; he must be paid. What will our children say?</p>
<p>GDP will certainly fall as we go deeper and deeper into this recession, a recession that many prominent economists—Krugman, among them—claim will be worse than most of us have ever experience, worse than anything since the Great Depression. Only the real old ones know what a Depression means.</p>
<p>We will, of course, buy fewer goods. Imports will clearly shrink.</p>
<p>What about exports? Those, I expect will shrink as well. The reasons are three-fold:
<ol>
<li>The recession will be, global, although some countries may still experience an enviable growth in GDP—China, for example. For this reason, we will find fewer and fewer markets for our own exports. </li>
<li>The dollar, paradoxically, remains strong. Without going into the reasons, we can easily deduce that a strong dollar will be a drag on our exports. (I suspect, though, just before we hit bottom, we will see the dollar plummet.) </li>
<li>Export platforms in developing countries—Asia and elsewhere—stand ready with cheap labor and plant investment to move into high gear should the global economy improve. We cannot, of course, compete with such export platforms; the above graphs clearly demonstrate we have been unable to compete in the last twenty years. We went deeper into debt and relied more and more on credit.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not sure how much economic activity will disappear from the U.S. economy before all this is over. Needless to say, I am profoundly worried.</p>
<p>Each day or week brings to the fore another crisis, be it in the financial sector, in jobs, or in major corporations within the U.S. failing rapidly.</p>
<p>With each crisis, more and more worried doctors surround the patient, each yelling that we need this or that bailout, this or that stimulus package. The entire hospital staff now surrounds this very important personage. Various drugs are administered; powerful defibrillators are rolled in. Cash infusions are poured into financial veins. Alarm bells drown out rationality.</p>
<p>Each crisis compounds succeeding ones.</p>
<p>In the short or medium term, one thing seems almost certain: Exports will not rescue the patient.</p>
<p>We are now in crisis mode, focused only on short-term fixes. We do not see the big picture.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will fashion the fixes intelligently enough to buy us some much needed time, fixes that will slow down our descent into the maelstrom, the awful dark hole of a real Depression.</p>
<p>We need time. For that reason alone I have partially supported many of the hurried rescue attempts. True, we do not have time to weigh each one carefully, time to plan them intelligently, time to gather the necessary personnel, time to set up efficient administration. True, many institutions or corporations have been poorly run.</p>
<p>What do we save; how do we save it; can we save it? If we cannot save it, should we try to lessen the impact of its sudden loss to the economy. Should we not give it enough life so that it can wither away more slowly, instead of sending a catastrophic earthquake through our economic life? In some cases, I would say, “Yes”</p>
<p>After all the debris has hit the streets and we zombies begin to gain some clarity, we will look again at Net Trade. We will honestly assess how globalization was structured. We will ignore those whose simple minds think that the only option is between free trade and protectionism.</p>
<p>Maybe then we will understand that globalization needs real structure, real planning, not blind belief that anything goes. Trade is the life’s blood of us all. Intelligent trade brings wealth to everyone. Some countries are (or were) far behind us in their share of the pie. I, for one, understand and sympathized with their envy and their rights. I want globalization to work, desperately; but not like this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these poorer countries should not expect to be suddenly stuffed, like bloated pigs. All they will get are excruciating stomach pains. They, too, will shortly be on the floor along with the rest of us. Great leaps forward, Chinese style, have always failed.</p>
<p><i>China, for example, in becoming an export platform, has simply not digested enough of its wealth to create a substantial, vibrant middle class.</i> Vibrant middle classes do not appear overnight, or even in a decade.</p>
<p>What are the leaders in Beijing going to tell their poor factory workers when the industrialized nations can no longer consume? “Sorry, our sugar daddy is going on a diet?” or “It was all the fault of those nasty financial capitalists?”</p>
<p>Similarly, we cannot expect to prosper if we just pump jobs overseas. We should not consume our cake, believing the next bite will be even richer and tastier.</p>
<p>China’s plan was just as foolish as our trade agreements, just as foolish as how the WTO has structured globalization. “Wisely and slow. They stumble who run fast,” says Friar Lawrence to the headstrong, lovesick Romeo. Romeo does not wait; does not consider. Instead, he rushes forward, sure that all will be well. We all know what happened.</p>
<p>Look again at those graphs. Did we plan for this kind of disequilibria? Did China or the emerging nations? Did we think we could just ignore producing? Have the emerging nations consider how fast they can wisely grow?</p>
<p>At the beginning of this century, many touted it as having a marvelous future. Well, here it is, barely a decade old, poised on the brink of the worst recession since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Someone out there better start thinking.</p>

<p><a href="http://healthcarethinktank.blogspot.com/2008/11/president-elect-obama-on-electronic.html">Health Care Think Tank</a> points to a note on President-elect Obama&#8217;s website concerning electronic record keeping for medical records.</p>
<p>The new guy Tom (STR) offers no comment himself.  In Boston, the major hospitals came together and mandated an electronic record keeping for the area, and compliance is very broad.  It does mean privileges are maintained&#8230;a powerful incentive.</p>
<p>Personal experience shows it to be efficient in identifying a patient across networks, satellite service and specialty areas in the region, local doctor&#8217;s notes and records, and insurance.</p>
<p>It was disconcerting to watch a doctor or nurse practitioner type on the laptop during the interview.  My experienced doctor handled that well, her nurse practitioner (young to me&#8230;?30&#8217;s?)less well for interview technique, one specialist less well due to awkwardness with the technology.</p>
<p>Otherwise not much difference for the patient, but lots more information was accessed over time.  Hopefully having to enter the data at point of service will become smoother.  I see a problem with history taking, however, becoming worse.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.aol.com/?feature=250596">The U.S. Navy says pirates seized a Saudi-owned supertanker</a> loaded with crude hundreds of miles off the Horn of Africa. The vessel, which has a 25-member crew, is the largest ever hijacked by bandits.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SSKgWPwyARI/AAAAAAAAAaI/lH9SmmK3Bvg/s1600-h/supertanker.JPEG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SSKgWPwyARI/AAAAAAAAAaI/lH9SmmK3Bvg/s320/supertanker.JPEG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>What does one do with such a catch?</p>
<p>1. Hold the crew hostage, similar to a hijacked jet?<br />2. The oil itself could be sold at a discount?  Or sold back to the Saudis? Insurance? How to pay comes to mind.<br />3. Given the size of the tanker, and easily tracked, hiding probably is out of the question, even if you are Goldfinger in 007.  Where does one go?<br />4. If the pirates are not terrorists willing to destroy the tanker or something similar for a political end at the least, what&#8217;s up?</p>
<p>As you can tell, the only experience I have in the pirate area is watching Peter Pan.  My prayers go to the crew.</p>

<p>Reader Bear points us to a great essay by</p>
<p>Michael Lewis in Condi Naste  <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom">Portfolio.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the two decades since then, I had been waiting for the end of Wall Street. The outrageous bonuses, the slender returns to shareholders, the never-ending scandals, the bursting of the internet bubble, the crisis following the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management: Over and over again, the big Wall Street investment banks would be, in some narrow way, discredited. Yet they just kept on growing, along with the sums of money that they doled out to 26-year-olds to perform tasks of no obvious social utility. The rebellion by American youth against the money culture never happened. Why bother to overturn your parents’ world when you can buy it, slice it up into tranches, and sell off the pieces?</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>While I&#8217;m trying to decide <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/11/report-bush-administration-will-not.html">whether unmanaged funds are preferrable to mismanaged ones</a>, and wondering whether any discussion of <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/1117081cuban1.html">Mark Cuban</a> (I like the picture better than CNN&#8217;s) belong here,* the NYT decides to continue its determined destruction of its reputation.</p>
<p>Stanley Fish manages to forget—or, more accurately, ignore, since he <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/administrative-virtues-the-case-of-larry-summers/?8ty&#038;emc=ty">mentions it in the first paragraph and then never again</a>—that judging Larry Summers&#8217;s ability to be Secretary of the Treasury might be easier by looking at how he did as, say, Secretary of the Treasury, instead of just sliming his time at Harvard,** and then producing this penultimate paragraph:<br />
<blockquote>What has all this to do with Larry Summers as a potential Secretary of the Treasury in the Obama administration? It depends on how much of the job involves what are usually called “people skills,” the skills that bring men and women of diverse views together in a spirit of optimism and co-operation (two words Obama has often invoked). A cabinet secretary must interact with other secretaries, with the White House staff, with the vice president, with congressional committees, with leaders of industry, with the representatives of other sovereign states and with the media.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gosh. You think maybe Summers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers#Public_official_and_educational_administrator">can do that</a>?</p>
<p>*Probably not for the specific issue.</p>
<p>**To be clear, since there was some confusion the last time I spoke nicely about Summers, he wouldn&#8217;t be my choice for Treasury Secretary.  But Jamie Galbraith, while a wonderful person with a good heart, doesn&#8217;t seem (from the two times I was in the same space as he at the AEA last year) to be an improvement in the people skills department, and <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/11/galbriath-on-mainstream-economics.html">a certain NYT columnist</a> already dislikes him.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbo.gov/aboutcbo/organization/od.htm">Peter Orszag</a> should be a contender, but doesn&#8217;t get named so it&#8217;s reasonable to assume he&#8217;s happy <a href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/">where he is</a>.</p>
<p>Fish&#8217;s piece, however, is the <em>People</em> magazine version of Summers&#8217;s tenure at Harvard, both in that it obsesses on &#8220;personality conflicts&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t deal with any of the substantive reasons, if any (op cit. David Warsh), for Summers&#8217;s dismissal from Harvard.</p>
<p>But, unless you&#8217;re going to argue that, because they are later, his five years at Harvard are more related to Treasury than his time at Treasury (which ended when Clinton did) you&#8217;re only going to either create sympathy for the man you&#8217;re trying to demonize or make yourself look stupid. Whether these are mutually exclusive is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>Brad DeLong said that Krugman eviscerated George F. Will on the level of capital spending during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Delong said:I have never been able to make any sense at all of the right-wing claim that the New Deal prolonged the Great Depression by creating a &#8220;crisis of confidence&#8221; that crippled private investment as American businessmen feared and hated &#8220;that Communist Roosevelt.&#8221; The crisis of confidence was created by the stock market crash, the deflation, and the bank failures of 1929-1933. Private investment recovered in a very healthy fashion as Roosevelt&#8217;s New Deal policies took effect.</p>
<p>I have posted on this before, but I would just remind everyone that business fixed investment is essentially a function of three things.<br />1. Corporate profits.<br />2. Capacity utilization or the GDP gap.<br />3. Cost of capital and the stock market is a good proxy for that.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SSLZqcyhoWI/AAAAAAAAAk4/V45XOhIrl3M/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SSLZqcyhoWI/AAAAAAAAAk4/V45XOhIrl3M/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>This is just as true today as it was in the 1930s and major econometric model use these three variables regularly.</p>
<p>But if you apply this analysis to the 1930s these three variables do a great job of explaining both the plunge in capital spending in from 1929 to 1932 and the recovery under the New Deal including the 1938 reversal.  As this charts shows these variables explain the depression and leave absolutely no room for the right wing thesis that FDR caused a crises of confidence that destroyed business spending in the 1930s.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still waiting for the proponents of this thesis to improve on my model.</p>
<p>P.S. corrected chart tittle.</p>

<p>I was wondering why Mr. Spitzer had not been heard from?  Was his personal indiscretion so great that his knowledge and expertise would not trump such?  </p>
<p>He has an opinion at the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/13/AR2008111303634.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">Washington Post yesterday</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>The new president&#8217;s team must soon get to the root causes of the mistakes that have brought us to the economic precipice. Yes, we have all derided the explosion of leverage, the failure to regulate derivatives, the flood of subprime lending that was bound to default and the excesses of CEO compensation. But these are all mere manifestations of three deeper structural problems that require greater attention: misconceptions about what a &#8220;free market&#8221; really is, a continuing breakdown in corporate governance and an antiquated and incoherent federal financial regulatory framework.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>One of the great advantages U.S. capital markets have enjoyed over the decades has been the view &#8212; held worldwide &#8212; that there was an underlying integrity to the representations market participants made, because the regulatory framework in which they were made was believed to provide genuine oversight. But as we all know, the laws requiring such integrity are meaningless without a government dedicated to enforcing them. </p>
<p>We do not need additional fragmented areas of federal regulation to handle hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds or derivatives. We need a unified approach that addresses the underlying issues: what kinds of leverage we wish to tolerate, how to measure risk, how much disclosure various trading products should provide.</p>
<p>Three overarching priorities should guide government actions in the new structure. First, we need better control of systemic risk.<br />Second, investors must be protected with adequate, accurate information. Firms must offer transparency both to individual investors and to government regulators. <br />[third]&#8230;we will have to step back from the current environment in which government has become a guarantor of all major risk. The so-called moral hazard will serve to devalue risk in the market, and this too will have a debilitating long-term effect on capital flows. Only if private actors have to bear the real risks they incur will the market function properly. We are now perilously close to nationalizing risk.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Robert Waldmann (stolen wholesale from his website by someone)</p>
<p><a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2008/11/media-matters-by-by-jamison-foser-foser.html">Media Matters by Jamison Foser</a></p>
<p>Foser has a devastating critique of, well the interpretation of a PEJ study. He says that the press (Howard Kurtz of course) has accepted the claim that coverage was biased in favor of Obama, based on the clear liberal bias of the fact, in this case including polls.</p>
<p>I steal much of his post, because I think he buried the lede.</p>
<p>    Unfortunately, the conservative complaints got some superficial support from a recent study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ) that claimed that John McCain has received much more &#8220;negative&#8221; coverage than Barack Obama during the campaign.</p>
<p>    The PEJ study quickly got significant attention from the establishment media and blogs.</p>
<p>    But while the study lends rhetorical support to the conservatives&#8217; arguments, it is nearly useless as an actual assessment of how the media covered the campaign.</p>
<p>    First off, it is worth noting this little nugget about the study&#8217;s methodology, buried at the end of the PEJ report: &#8220;Talk radio stories &#8230; were not included in this campaign study of tone.&#8221; PEJ offers no justification for the exclusion of talk radio. Not a word. In what surely must be a coincidence, talk radio skews further to the right than any other medium.</p>
<p>    Now, here&#8217;s PEJ&#8217;s description of how it assesses whether a news report is &#8220;positive&#8221; or &#8220;negative&#8221;:</p>
<p>    To examine tone, the Project takes a particularly cautious and conservative approach. Unlike some researchers, we examine not just whether assertions in stories are positive or negative, but also whether they are inherently neutral. This, we believe, provides a much clearer and fairer sense of the tone of coverage than ignoring those balanced or mixed evaluations. Second, we do not simply tally up all the evaluative assertions in stories and compile them into a single pile to measure. Journalists and audiences think about press coverage in stories or segments. They ask themselves, is this story positive or negative or neutral? Hence the Project measures coverage by story, and for a story to be deemed as having a negative or positive tone, it must be clearly so, not a close call: for example, the negative assertions in a story must outweigh positive assertions by a margin of at least 1.5 to 1 for that story to be deemed negative.</p>
<p>    OK &#8230; anyone want to guess what that means in practical terms?</p>
<p>    Unfortunately, the few actual examples of &#8220;positive&#8221; and &#8220;negative&#8221; coverage PEJ offers do little to clarify its methodology, and less to inspire confidence. For example, PEJ notes:</p>
<p>    Some of that positive coverage was related to evidence that the financial crisis was aiding Obama. &#8220;Recent economic woes have given Democrat Barack Obama a clear lead over Republican John McCain,&#8221; declared a story posted on AOL News on Sept. 24, citing a 9-point lead for Obama in a new Washington Post/ABC News poll.</p>
<p>    That&#8217;s what counts as &#8220;positive&#8221; coverage of Obama? A fairly straightforward report that a poll finds Obama in a &#8220;clear lead&#8221; over McCain? And, it seems, much of Obama&#8217;s &#8220;positive&#8221; coverage consisted of reports like that:</p>
<p>    The data clearly point in this direction for some of the explanation. Of those stories that focused mostly on polls, a clear majority (57%) were positive for Obama, while less than a quarter (23%) were negative. Similarly, stories about the electoral map, swing states and campaign strategy were even more favorable (77% positive vs. 6% negative). These represent the most positive element of Obama&#8217;s coverage.</p>
<p>    So, if a candidate is winning, and the polls show that, and the media report that the polls show the candidate winning, that counts as &#8220;positive&#8221; coverage. Well, OK, it&#8217;s true that such a story is &#8220;positive,&#8221; but it tells us nearly nothing about the media.<br />__________________________________<br />by Robert Waldmann</p>

<p>Recovery vehicle? Who knows.</p>
<p>I know this, whatever it is won&#8217;t work. This systemic failure was baked into the cake years ago. It was unsustainable form the start. The only question was how long will it last.</p>
<p>I laughed out loud yesterday when I heard an NPR interview with Paulson where he said &#8220;They were trying to get people BORROWING again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Think about that. We are experiencing the blowback of overborrowing and these geniuses think we should borrow MORE??!!</p>
<p>They just act like all the wealth BELONGS to the few (given by God of course) and the rest of us just need to rent it from them. They want to pay just enough salary for us to be able to rent all the things they make available and not a penny more.</p>
<p>Until someone exposes this fallacy of the system ( and although I enthusiastically supported Obama because he is light years better than the entrenched wealth republicans, I&#8217;m not sure Obama will make any headway along these lines)<br />we will continue to be stricken with &#8220;business cycles&#8221; which really just reflect the schizophrenic wants and needs of the investor class as they &#8220;chase&#8221; ever elusive double digit returns.</p>
<p>Most people I know want to work, work a full days work, earn a living commensurate to their talents and effort and go home, recreate, (or procreate) sleep and do it again. They&#8217;ll do it for fifty years if its a job they have chosen.<br />The idea that people who recognize the abject absurdity of the current debt driven model, sustained by supply side mumbo jumbo are somehow in favor of a Soviet style central economy where you pretend to work and we&#8217;ll pretend to pay you, is absurd.</p>
<p>These false dichotomies that get thrown about are just ridiculous. You don&#8217;t have to back the current model with all its warts to be a CAPITALIST. There is a better way to do what we have given our investment class the responsibility of doing. I would not want to be put in charge of setting it up but I know I would start with a maxim. You get paid for work, not for gambling with other peoples money. Gambling with your own money is fine but placing my life savings at risk because you want a side bet with some high roller in London on whether or not some homeowner in Detroit is gonna default on his loan SHOULD be a crime. It should also be punishable by what ever our society deems is the maximum penalty for a crime. There is nothing socially redeemable about this activity.<br />____________________________<br /> by reader Greg in comments</p>
