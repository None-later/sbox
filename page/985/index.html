                                                                    </div>

                                <p>In thinking about the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/vat-as-solution-to-fiscal-nightmare.html">merits and faults of the VAT</a>, I came across some interesting data.  The first source is a paper by Timothy Smeeding entitled &#8220;<a href="">Public Policy and Economic Inequality: The United States in Comparative Perspective</a>&#8220;.  Professor Smeeding used a unique data set from a project called the <a href="http://www.lisproject.org/">Luxembourg Income Study</a> to gain various perspectives on differences in income inequality across developed countries and over time.  The result that I found most interesting in the context of thinking about the VAT was his calculation of income inequality both before and after taxes.  The graph below presents his results.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/tax_prog1.jpg"><br />Notes: The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini coefficient</a> is measured from 100 (complete inequality) to 0 (total equality).<br />Figures are from the mid- to late-1990s, depending on the country.  See Smeeding&#8217;s paper for details.</p>
<p>The striking thing to me is how little the US&#8217;s tax code changes income inequality in the US.  Yes, the US tax code is progressive, so that disposable income after taxes is a bit less unequal than it was before taxes&#8230; but the progressivity of the US tax code is quite modest compared to other developed countries.</p>
<p>Pairing this result with the tax structure of other developed countries thus reveals an important point, which I briefly mentioned in my previous post about the VAT: having a VAT doesn&#8217;t mean that the tax code need be regressive.  And conversely, the absence of the VAT doesn&#8217;t meant that you have a progressive tax code.</p>
<p>The following table ranks the countries in the graph by how much their tax codes reduce income inequality (the first column).  The other columns give a broad sketch of how taxes are raised in other countries: the proportion of taxes raised through consumption taxes and income taxes, the VAT rates, and the maximum marginal tax rate on income.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/tax_prog2.jpg"><br />Sources: The first column&#8217;s data is from Smeeding; the rest from the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/60/0,2340,en_2649_37427_1942460_1_1_1_37427,00.html">OECD Tax Database</a>.  <br />Note: Tax data for the year 2002.</p>
<p>All developed countries collect more &#8211; usually far more &#8211; of their tax revenue through consumption taxes than does the US.  Yet their tax codes are far more progressive.  And surprisingly, other countries do not create that tax code progressivity by simply levying high marginal income tax rates on the rich; in general, their top rate is on par with that of the US.  Instead, they generate progressivity in the tax code through generous low-income tax exemptions or credits, and top marginal tax rates that kick in at much lower levels of income than in the US.</p>
<p>I take two major lessons from this data.  First, the lack of progressivity in the US tax structure is striking, and in my opinion, disgraceful.  For those who think something needs to be done to ameliorate the US&#8217;s income inequality problem, making the tax code more progressive should clearly be one of the first lines of policy attack.  There&#8217;s a tremendous amount of room for improvement there.</p>
<p>Secondly, the data suggests that the degree of progressivity of a country&#8217;s taxes is determined not by the mix of types of taxes collected, but rather by the political will to make the tax system progressive.  Countries that like a progressive tax code can make that happen regardless of whether they have a VAT, income taxes, social insurance taxes, or any other specific type of tax.  And countries like the US that haven&#8217;t seemed to favor a particularly progressive tax system also are able to implement that preference despite the use of more income taxes and fewer consumption taxes.</p>
<p>I find this oddly reassuring when considering a VAT in the US.  Every country that has implemented a VAT has been able to maintain a much greater degree of tax progressivity than the US.  It seems very plausible that the introduction of a VAT in the US could therefore be paired with changes in income taxes to keep the US tax code as progressive as it already is.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I worry less about whether there is or isn&#8217;t a VAT in the US, and much more about trying to change other features of the tax code that could make the tax system far more progressive in the US.  The tax code will be progressive or not regardless of the existence of the VAT, depending on how much political will exists to make it progressive.  So developing that political will is exactly where I think we should focus our efforts in the fight against excessive income inequality. </p>

While I’m not buying the “savvy investor” view of <a href="http://users.starpower.net/jkitch/ShareShrewd.pdf">John Kitchen</a>, his paper is worth the read.  Kitchen notes the Dark Matter thesis and adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cline (2005, p. 262), one of the few analysts to explicitly recognize and account for these “other” valuation changes, identifies them as “statistical ‘manna from heaven.’”</p></blockquote>
<p>That would be William R. Cline’s Th<em>e United States as a Debtor Nation</em> (Institute for International Economics, Washington, DC, 2005).</p>

                                <p>Imagine waking up in Chicago on some cold wintry morning, putting on your heavy overcoat – only to have someone tell you that the coat will not keep your any warmer.  After all, who in Hawaii ever wears a heavy overcoat?  Now, I know this tale sounds absolutely stupid but check out the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200603300954.asp">John Tamny</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Federal Reserve announced a quarter-point rise in the federal funds rate on Tuesday and futures markets have priced in another quarter-point hike for May, which would bring the key overnight interest rate to 5 percent. The positive or negative economic impact of continued rate hikes aside, the price of gold is what many Fed-watchers will study to gauge the effect of the rate increases. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, nominal fed funds rate increases have rarely succeeded in bringing down the price of gold. While this phenomenon in part can be explained by the fact that rate hikes have often occurred amidst inflationary episodes, economist Alan Reynolds has made the point that the “Fed should remember that countries with sustained low inflation never have high interest rates, so high interest rates cannot be the route to low inflation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure if Mr. Reynolds was ever this guilty of confusing cause and effect.  And I’m certainly not happy with tighter monetary policy given my view is that we are still below full employment.  Then again – I do not equate gold prices with the general rate of inflation.</p>

                                <p>In the new issue of <em>The Economists&#8217; Voice</em>, Robert Shiller has a piece on house prices: &#8220;<a href="http://www.bepress.com/ev/vol3/iss4/art4/">Long-Term Perspectives on the Current Boom in Home Prices</a>.&#8221;  Here&#8217;s the picture that tells a thousand words:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/shiller1.gif"></p>
<p>Despite massive population growth over the periods shown in all three countries, there&#8217;s very little upward trend in home prices.  Fluctuations in the real price of houses are clearly driven by other factors, and seem to be temporary; between 1900 and 2000 the real price of houses in the US was virtually unchanged.  The rapid price appreciation of the past 5 years certainly looks odd&#8230;</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The issue of immigration has been well-documented as exposing a rift among Republicans in recent days; articles in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/29/AR2006032900284.html">Washington Post</a>, <a href="http://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_VGSSQGQ">The Economist</a>, and the <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/640c6c62-bf52-11da-9de7-0000779e2340.html">Financial Times</a> are but a few examples.  </p>
<p>But the political left seems to me to be nearly as split on the issue.  Numerous readers of this blog have expressed serious concerns about illegal immigration; on the other hand, others on the left (like me) are concerned about illegal immigration only in the sense that we would like to allow many more of those individuals to be in the US legally.  Ezra Klein shared similar sentiments on <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2006/03/index.html#009623">The American Prospect Online</a> yesterday, as did Brad Plumer in <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2006/03/immigration_ref.html">Mother Jones</a> the day before.  Because the interests of immigrants and the Democratic party are pretty well aligned (who is closer to the archetypical “little guy” than a poor immigrant, after all?), it’s not surprising that immigrants tend to lean Democratic.</p>
<p>Yet there are at least two good political reasons why people on the left might be concerned about immigration, as well.  The first is immigration’s impact on income inequality.  Illegal immigration in particular may have some effect in depressing wages for low-skill native-born Americans.  But as Plumer and Klein both articulate better than I can, concerns about the impact of illegal immigrants on low-skill wages in the US actually provide a good reason for liberals to want to give illegal immigrants legal status, rather than send them home.</p>
<p>More generally, as I’ve tried to argue, if you’re concerned about low wages for relatively unskilled native-born Americans (which I am) then you need to address that problem directly, by advocating changes in minimum wage laws, tax laws, the strength of organized labor, the educational system, and so forth.  Immigration is only a very small part of the much bigger problem of low wages for unskilled workers in the US, and so restricting immigration is a lousy way to try to address that particular problem. </p>
<p>A second reason for liberals to be wary of immigration has been highlighted by Paul Krugman.  He is concerned that more immigrants in a country may tend to undermine the political support for that country’s social safety net.  The logic is simple: why should I pay taxes to support social programs that immigrants just come and take advantage of?  More immigrants could thus cause more native-born citizens to vote against the social safety net that liberals like.</p>
<p>This strikes me as a potentially serious problem, particularly in European countries with a very generous safety net.  In fact, there’s even some evidence that suggests that such a political change has started happening in Europe as the result of immigration. </p>
<p>However, I’m not convinced that it poses such a big problem for the US.  Many aspects of the US’s social safety net (such as it is) are already off-limits to immigrants, and those social benefits that are available to immigrants are not particularly generous, and so can’t realistically be cut by much.  Furthermore, if the concern is that illegal immigrants are using social services while evading the taxes to pay for them (which they often don’t evade, by the way – for example, illegal immigrants <strike>contribute</strike> pay tax on earnings of about <a href="http://www.immigrationforum.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=724">$50bn per year</a> to the Social Security trust fund, even though they get no SS benefits) then once again the obvious solution seems to be to give those illegal immigrants legal status.  </p>
<p>In short, it is quite possible to address the hesitations that some liberals have about allowing more legal immigration through the use of other policies.  Furthermore, those other policies would do a much better job at addressing the concerns of liberals than any new restrictions on immigration would.  From a political standpoint, therefore, it seems that the optimal policy for Democrats might be to advocate a mix of increased legal immigration, better protections for workers, and a stronger social safety net.  </p>

<p>UPDATE: I&#8217;ve fixed my sloppy statement about illegal immigrant contributions to the Social Security trust fund.  Sorry about the confusion.</p>

                                <p>The BEA released its <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/newsrel/gdpnewsrelease.htm">final estimate</a> of GDP growth and the national income account for 2005.  The figures on GDP show no surprises.  But the news release also highlights corporate profits in 2005.  The figures show that 2005 was a good year to be an owner of a corporation:<br />
<blockquote>Profits from current production increased 16.4 percent in 2005, compared with an increase of 12.6 percent in 2004.  Domestic profits increased 17.4 percent, compared with an increase of 14.1 percent.  The rest-of-the-world component of profits increased 11.2 percent, compared with an increase of 5.1 percent.</p>
<p>Taxes on corporate income increased 39.5 percent in 2005, compared with an increase of 16.8 percent in 2004.  Profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased 9.4 percent, compared with an increase of 11.3 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The one strange thing, however, is that the managers of corporations in the US are choosing to retain more of those profits in the company, rather than spend them or give them back to shareholders:<br />
<blockquote>Dividends increased 4.3 percent [in 2005], compared with an increase of 16.5 percent [in 2004]; current-production undistributed profits increased 15.7 percent, compared with an increase of 5.5 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The dividend payout in 2004 was significantly distorted by Microsoft&#8217;s special $30bn dividend payout in December of 2004&#8230; but even so, corporate managers seem to be keeping a lot of 2005&#8217;s profits on hand until they decide what to do with all of that money.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>In my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/true-fiscal-nightmare.html">previous post</a>, I suggest one possible rationale for levying a VAT: if you think that the US needs to raise more tax revenue, and if you think that political opposition to significant increases in income taxes is strong, then adding a new VAT on top of existing income taxes is one important option to consider.  Let me take this chance to go into the pros and cons of a VAT in more detail.  (For a brief primer on what a VAT is, you might want to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT">Wikipedia</a>, or Bruce Bartlett’s <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/03/the_best_tax_ev.html">latest post</a>.) </p>
<p>Advantages of a VAT:
<ul>
<li>It can raise lots of new tax revenue with relatively low tax rates.  A reasonably broad-based 10% VAT in the US would raise several hundred billion dollars of tax revenue.   (Obviously, this is only an advantage if you think that we need to raise more tax revenue in the first place.)  Raising the equivalent revenue through income taxes would require far higher marginal tax rates.</p>
</li>
<li>Tax evasion is a relatively small problem.  Because a VAT requires each step in the production process to report what the previous step in the production process sold to them, there’s a degree of automatic enforcement in VAT administration, unlike with sales or income taxes.  Furthermore, since a VAT is so broad-based, the rate can be set very low, which means that each individual business has relatively little incentive to try to cheat.  The experience of countries with VAT is that compliance is higher than for most other types of taxes (much higher than for sales taxes, for example), and the costs of enforcement are lower.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages of a VAT:
<ul>
<li>As is the case of all consumption taxes, a VAT is regressive; lower-income people pay a larger fraction of their income in taxes than higher-income people do.</p>
</li>
<li>Since a VAT taxes consumption rather than income, it hits those who consume but don&#8217;t earn income harder, e.g. retirees.
</li>
<li>A VAT may alter international competitiveness.</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantages of imposing a VAT are fairly straightforward.  I tend to think that the US government will indeed need to raise more revenues as a fraction of GDP in future decades, and that a VAT would be a less painful way of doing so than most alternatives that I can think of.  </p>
<p>Sure, there are other ways to raise revenue; so the test is whether the VAT does it more efficiently (i.e. imposing fewer economic distortions and creating fewer incentives to cheat) and more equitably than the possible alternatives.  Regarding efficiency, the answer seems pretty clear.  That’s why every other developed country around the world has concluded that the VAT is indeed a better way to raise the additional needed revenue.   Equity, however, is another story… </p>
<p>So let’s get to the problems with a VAT.  They are potentially substantial, and deserve careful scrutiny.  When AB first started this blog, he devoted several posts to explaining the regressivity problems of consumption taxes.  To get a good overview of those problems, take a look at his posts under the topic heading “Consumption Taxes” in the left-hand column of this blog.</p>
<p>Put simply, consumption taxes, including a VAT, are regressive.  It’s hard to get around that fact.  But there are a couple of things that you can do to mitigate these effects.  For example, you can exempt certain items that poor people spend a larger fraction of their income on (food is a popular example).  Even better, however, would be to couple the imposition of a VAT with changes in income taxes to make them more progressive.</p>
<p>This is a crucial point: a VAT by itself is surely regressive; but a VAT coupled with income taxes does not have to be.  As an example, simply note that all European countries have a VAT.  Yet all of them have a total net tax system that is far more progressive than the US’s tax system.  I&#8217;ll have more to say about this in another post that I&#8217;m working on.</p>
<p>The potential problem of the VAT hitting retirees harder is probably less of a problem than one might think.  First of all, since the &#8220;fiscal nightmare&#8221; is almost completely the result of health spending on retirees, if they ended up paying a higher share of the VAT than others that might only be fair.  But secondly, the disproportionate impact on retirees is likely to be substantially mitigated in the first place.  A VAT has the effect of raising overall price levels in the economy, as businesses incorporate the VAT in their sales price.  But that means that the cost of living adjustment that retirees receive on their Social Security benefits would also go up by the same amount.  The net effect is a wash for those retirees who depend primarily on their Social Security benefits as income.</p>
<p>The last potential drawback of a VAT also turns out not to be a problem.  Economic theory suggests that a “destination VAT” – that is, a VAT imposed on all goods, but only those goods, consumed in the country – should not affect international competitiveness one way or another, in and of itself. (Note that a destination VAT requires that all imports are taxed at the regular VAT rate, and that exporters receive a rebate on all VAT taxes that the exported item has incurred during production.)  As a slight twist on this result, note that if a VAT falls more heavily on traded goods than non-traded goods due to some items being exempted, then a VAT would be expected to cause a fall in both imports and exports.  For a paper explaining the logic, see the classic Krugman and Feldstein paper “<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=227283">International Trade Effects of Value Added Taxation</a>”.</p>
<p>The empirical evidence seems to confirm the economic theory.  A paper by <a href="http://www.people.hbs.edu/mdesai/vats.pdf">Mihir Desai and James Hines</a> suggests that the VAT does have a small effect on trade, but that it simultaneously reduces both imports and exports with no substantial net effects.  On the other hand, an even more recent paper by the IMF, “<a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2006/wp0647.pdf">Domestic Taxes and International Trade</a>,” was unable to find any effect of the VAT on trade.  Either way, the effects of a VAT on trade seem to be small and neutral, in the sense of not really changing the balance of trade or a country’s competitveness.</p>
<p>To sum up, I would therefore offer this assessment of a VAT: it has some distinct advantages, and it has a huge potential disadvantage (regressivity) that can be overcome with the right other policy changes.  So personally, I could possibly get behind the idea of a VAT to raise more taxes… but only if combined with changes to the income tax code to make them significantly more progressive.</p>
<p>But before we do that, my preferred solution to the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/true-fiscal-nightmare.html">fiscal nightmare</a> would be this: enact a sweeping change in how health care is paid for, and adopt <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/politics-of-single-payer-health-care.html">single-payer health insurance</a>.  Give it 10 years, and see how health care spending and the growth in spending adjust.  I suspect that such a change by itself would solve much or all of the fiscal problem.  If there’s still a fiscal problem after that (and there might be, I realize), then consider a VAT &#8211; but only in tandem with changes in income taxes to make them more progressive.  The fact that every developed country in the world has a more rational health care system and a more progressive tax code, and also has a VAT, may be a sign in the VAT’s favor.  </p>

                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/fiscally-realistic-conservative.html">Bruce Bartlett’s post</a> on his NYTimes blog last week highlighted the long-term fiscal problems faced by the US.  He mentioned that his preferred solution would be to impose a national value added tax (VAT) to help close the gap between expected federal revenues and spending.  His most recent NYTimes post (see <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/03/the_best_tax_ev.html">Mark Thoma</a> for excerpts, if you don&#8217;t have <a href="http://bartlett.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=12">Times Select</a> access) elaborates on why he thinks the VAT is a good solution to a big problem.</p>
<p>Several people have since noted that before any additional taxes are considered, we should first simply reverse the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003.  The problem, however, is this: it turns out that even reversing the Bush tax cuts will not be nearly enough to solve the US’s true fiscal problems over the coming decades.  </p>
<p>As they do every year, in December the CBO released their analysis of the budgetary implications of several spending and revenue scenarios in the document “<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6982&#038;sequence=0">The Long-Term Budget Outlook</a>”.  I’ve distilled their multiple scenarios down to one picture representing what I think is a reasonably likely “intermediate” (i.e. not too sunny and not too doomsday-ish) projection.  </p>
<p>To get this “intermediate” projection I do the following:
<ul>
<li>I exclude Social Security revenues and spending, since Social Security is separately funded from the rest of the budget, and because the purpose of this exercise is to focus on the future imbalances in the rest of the federal budget, which dwarf those of the Social Security trust fund.  (The SS gap is only around 1-2% of GDP in the decades after 2020, compared to the much larger numbers you’ll find below.)  </p>
</li>
<li>On the revenue side, I use the CBO’s estimate based on an extension of current law governing the individual income tax.  In other words, the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire (most of them in 2010).  After that, real bracket creep (real income growth pushing taxpayers into higher tax brackets) and the AMT cause total revenues to gradually rise.
</li>
<li>Regarding spending, I assume that the excess cost growth in Medicare and Medicaid is only 1.0 percentage point per year (compared to the average past rate of health care growth of 2.5 percentage points above overall economic growth).  I also follow the CBO’s projections that assume that defense spending follows the Administration’s 2006 Future Years Defense Program (with allowances for cost risks and additional spending to support the war on terrorism) through 2024, and that other types of spending (except for interest payments on the debt) remain at their historical levels as a share of GDP.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you put these assumptions together you get the following picture:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/gen_fund_deficit.jpg"></p>
<p>Obviously, even with the end of the Bush tax cuts in 2010, the picture is ugly.  The general fund deficit (i.e. the deficit excluding the SS trust fund) will be close to 4% of GDP during 2010-2015, and widen to 4.6% of GDP by 2020, 6% of GDP by 2025, and 8% of GDP by 2030.  After that the fiscal problem gets so bad that there’s no point in following things further.</p>
<p>Maybe you disagree with my assumptions.  Fine – you can play this game yourself.  Mix and match your own assumptions about revenues and spending with the help of the handy spreadsheet available from the CBO <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6982&#038;sequence=0">here</a>.  It might make for a fun party game.  (I guess that depends on your definition of &#8220;fun&#8221;, though.)</p>
<p>But whatever specific choices you make, I think that you’ll find that under all reasonable scenarios there’s a huge fiscal problem looming for the US that is totally unrelated to Social Security.  </p>
<p>So now for the tough part: What are some possible resolutions to this problem?  There are only a few options, so it’s quite easy to enumerate them:
<ol>
<li>Just live with the deficits.  It is certainly possible to live with budget deficits of 3, 4, or 5% of GDP.  We&#8217;ve done it in the past, and we&#8217;re doing it currently.  However, by the 2020s we&#8217;ll be in a completely different situation: the deficit will be large and growing far faster than the economy.  Put another way, the deficit will be growing as a fraction of the economy just to make the interest payments on the debt.  Such a situation is literally unsustainable &#8211; it is the equivalent of a pyramid scheme.  If the picture presented above still holds true by the 2020s, US will find itself unable to finance its deficit at any reasonable rate of interest, simply because lenders will (quite reasonably) doubt the ability of the US government to repay its debts when they come due 10 or 20 or 30 years down the road.  So living with the picture above is simply not an option.</p>
</li>
<li>Cut non-defense discretionary spending.  This is many conservatives’ favorite answer, but since such spending is only 5.1% of GDP in the projection above in the year 2025, even slashing such spending in half would still leave a large deficit.  But I think that such speculation is irrelevant; recent <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060329/ap_on_go_co/congress_budget;_ylt=AvxSi2CIDVnwr0btSUTI2gys0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3OXIzMDMzBHNlYwM3MDM-">hesitation even among Republicans</a> to cut discretionary spending from current levels seems to indicate that such spending has already been cut by as much as is politically tolerable.  So this option is a non-starter, I think.
</li>
<li>Cut defense spending.  The scenario graphed above assumes defense spending of only about 3% of GDP in the year 2025, however (compared to about 4% of GDP currently), so again we find that even cutting such spending in half would leave a huge problem.  More relevantly, I think that it would be politically difficult to do much cutting here in the first place, so again I am comfortable ruling out this option.
</li>
<li>Totally change our health care system.  The federal government could stop providing health benefits to the nation’s retirees… but again I find that politically unlikely.  Alternatively, some sort of major health care system reform that generated massive cost savings and rationalization of medical care services – such as a move to a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/politics-of-single-payer-health-care.html">single-payer health insurance system</a> – could do the trick. (This would be my preferred solution to the problem, incidentally.)
</li>
<li>If you rule out fundamental changes to health care, and if you agree that options #2 and #3 are not going to help you much in closing the massive general fund deficit, then you’re left with only one more option: raising taxes.  Such new tax revenues would need to be on the order of 5% of GDP, at least to start with.  For context, note that the federal income tax raises about 10% of GDP in taxes, so raising such new revenues through the income tax would require an approximately 50% rise in income taxes.  Alternatively, you could consider adding a completely new tax, such as the VAT.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given this list, I think that Bruce Bartlett’s logic for favoring the VAT is thus pretty good; if you rule out options #1-4 above, and you don’t think that voters will tolerate a 50% increase in income taxes, then a VAT may make the most sense.  In an upcoming post I’ll discuss the pros and cons of a VAT in a bit of detail.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Some of you have wondered why I haven&#8217;t yet made much of an effort to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration.  It’s a fair question.  Let me share my thoughts with you about the two, and explain why my sentiments about immigration in general mean that I don’t worry much about the distinction between the two. </p>
<p>Personally, I tend to see immigration as a positive thing.  It helps the people immigrating, and it makes the US population as a whole stronger, richer, more creative, and more connected to the rest of the world.  This analysis applies to both kinds of immigrants, legal and illegal. </p>
<p>But could there be reasons why one might want to reduce illegal immigration while leaving legal immigration rules alone?  Let me try to compile a preliminary (and surely incomplete) list of reasons why one might want to reduce the number of illegal immigrants without allowing them legal entry as an alternative.
<ol>
<li>Lots of illegal immigrants come to the US every year.  Therefore, if you simply want to cut down on the number of total immigrants to the US, one way would be to make stronger efforts to reduce illegal immigration while denying the deterred illegal immigrants the option to legally enter the US.  (Alternatively, you could reduce the number of legal immigrants allowed.)</p>
</li>
<li>By far the largest source country of illegal immigrants is Mexico.  So if you want to change the mix of the country-of-origin of immigrants coming in to the US (i.e. have a smaller proportion of immigrants come from Mexico), then again a good tactic would be to specifically try to reduce illegal immigration.
</li>
<li>Illegal immigrants, being in a precarious legal situation, are more easily taken advantage of by employers.  If your concern is the well-being of the illegal immigrants, a sensible tactic would be to try to reduce the number of illegal immigrants.  However, a corollary to that is that you should also want them to be legally allowed to remain in the US (since they obviously want to be here, given that they are willing to do it illegaly), in which case efforts to reduce illegal immigration should be coupled with an increase in legally allowed immigrants.  On the other hand, if your concern is the effect of this phenomenon on the US labor market, then we can combine this item with #4 below&#8230;
</li>
<li>Illegal immigrants may be poorer and less well-educated (on average) than legal immigrants.  This (possibly combined with #3 above) could have effects on the domestic market for unskilled labor in the US.  If you want to try to address such concerns by changing the mix of the income/educational level of immigrants coming to the US, then one way might be to reduce illegal immigration while maintaining legal immigration at current levels.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are probably other reasons to consider, but let me work with this as a start, and try to explain why my predisposition in favor of immigration covers both the legal and illegal kind.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t think that there are too many immigrants in the US.  If anything, I think the US should accept more immigrants than it currently does.  This is the whole point behind my occasional arguments in favor of immigration in general.  I am therefore not in favor of clamping down on illegal immigration for reason #1.</p>
<p>I also have no problem with the country mix of immigrants; I don’t think that immigrants from Mexico are inherently better or worse to have in the US than immigrants from any other country.  So reason #2 doesn’t persuade me to want to reduce illegal immigration flows.</p>
<p>I am concerned about issue #3.  I think that the plight of illegal immigrants in the US is often horrible, and a disgrace to a country like the US.  This pushes me in favor of reducing illegal immigration, but only if it’s replaced with more legal immigration.  If we imposed harsher penalties on illegal immigrants while simultaneously allowing an extra few hundred thousand legal immigrants (<em><strong>not</strong></em> the horrible &#8220;guest worker&#8221; idea, but fully legal immigrants) to enter the US every year, I might be okay with that.</p>
<p>Issue #4 may be the most difficult one to resolve.  It really is a part of the deeper question of how much should the US try to shape the type of immigrants that we allow.  Perhaps the US should more actively try to change the mix of immigrants toward more high-skill individuals.  That would raise the average skill-level of the US population, and reduce the downward wage pressures on unskilled workers in the US.  From a cost-benefit point of view, changing the mix of immigrants in such a manner would certainly be better for the US than the current system.  </p>
<p>However, from a moral point of view that seems potentially problematic.  Is it better to allow a doctor from Nigeria to come to the US and increase his standard of living from being relatively well-off in Nigeria to being relatively well-off in the US, instead of allowing a farm worker from Mexico come to the US and transform the situation of his children from being hungry, sick, and illiterate to getting basic nutrition, health care, and education?  And is it okay to deliberately try to deprive the poorest parts of the world of their best-educated people?</p>
<p>This in turn relates to the still deeper question of why we allow immigration in the first place: is the goal to improve the US, or is it to improve the lives of the individuals who want to immigrate?</p>
<p>For me, both goals matter, at least to some degree.  I&#8217;m more sympathetic toward that poor Mexican farm worker than I am toward the Nigerian doctor, but the Nigerian doctor will probably make me (and the rest of the US) a tiny bit richer than the Mexican would.  To me, those two effects roughly balance out.  As a result, I’m not particularly in favor of changing the rules to only allow high-skilled immigrants in to the US.  I can see the logic of it (it’s really an economist’s logic, after all), but it doesn&#8217;t satisfy my sense of morality.  </p>
<p>That said, I do worry about the income inequality in the US that unskilled illegal immigrants might cause (due to both items #3 and #4).  But I worry about income inequality in the US much more generally than that.  Income inequality is a huge problem in the US, and the problem is much bigger than immigration can account for.  My preferred policy response to income inequality would therefore be to try to address income inequality much more directly, for example by improving basic education for lower-income people or by changing the tax code, not through the back-handed method (one with many negative side-effects) of reducing unskilled immigration.</p>
<p>Putting this all together, I find that I don&#8217;t worry about illegal immigration any more than I worry about legal immigration.  I&#8217;d like there to be fewer illegal immigrants, but only because I&#8217;d like more of them to be able to enter the country legally.  Put another way, I could possibly favor harsher treatment for illegal immigrants, and I’d even be willing to pay for stricter border enforcement&#8230; but only if those policy changes were accompanied by a much more liberal legal immigration policy, and a policy to bring current illegal immigrants into fully legal status.  </p>
<p>Note that I am not advocating completely open borders &#8211; I think that some sort of limit on legal immigration is reasonable, simply because overly rapid population growth in the US would cause its own set of problems.  However, current population growth in the US is only about 1% per year, including immigration.  That is near the lowest levels of population growth ever experienced in the US &#8211; only in the 1930s was it lower.  I think the US can handle a bit more than that.</p>
<p>I realize that I am probably in the minority on this one (no pun intended)&#8230; but you asked for my opinion, and now you have it.  Have fun in the comments.</p>

                                <p>Simpsons aficionados among you already know that the Simpsons addressed the issue of immigration back in 1996, in the episode “Much Apu About Nothing”.  Here’s a summary of the beginning of the episode, thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Much_Apu_About_Nothing">Wikipedia</a> (Btw, I never would have guessed that Wikipedia contains entries on individual Simpsons episodes&#8230;)<br />
<blockquote>On an ordinary day, a bear strolls onto Evergreen Terrace. It is quickly subdued by the police, not before accidentally shooting and capturing Barney Gumble. Homer rants about these &#8220;constant bear attacks&#8221;, even though this is the very first bear Ned has seen in his forty years of living on that street. Homer then leads an angry mob and demands that Mayor Quimby do something about this. Soon, the Bear Patrol is created, a useless organization which even makes use of a B-2 Spirit. Homer then gets just as shocked [as] when he saw the bear when he discovers that taxes have been raised five dollars to maintain the Bear Patrol.</p></blockquote>
<p>After that, the angry mob returns to the mayor’s office, yelling &#8220;Down with taxes!  Down with taxes!&#8221;  The mayor has to do something&#8230;<br />
<blockquote><strong>Quimby:</strong> Are those morons getting dumber or just louder?</p>
<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> <em>[Takes a moment to check his clipboard]</em> Dumber, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Quimby:</strong> They want the bear patrol but they won&#8217;t pay taxes for it.  This is a situation that calls for real leadership.  <em>[Opens the door to his office to confront the angry mob.]</em>  </p>
<p>People, your taxes are high because of illegal immigrants!</p>
<p><strong>Moe Szyslak: </strong> Immigants!  I knew it was them!  Even when it was the bears, I knew it was them.</p></blockquote>
<p> Let’s not confuse fiction with reality, though.  I certainly can’t believe that politicians in real life would ever raise the issue of immigration to cover up for their failures in other areas of policy, such as taxes, government spending, income inequality, education, health care&#8230;</p>
