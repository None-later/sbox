                                <p>I am just catching up with some of the news this week.  <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2012/09/things-more-worthy-of-remembrance-than.html">Barkley Rosser</a> at <i>Econospeak</i> had a timely post on 9/11 ceremonies and reminds us about what we accept as special or inevitably normal:</p>
<p>Things More Worthy Of Remembrance Than 9/11</p>
<p>Yes, what happened 11 years ago today was awful and tragic, and there is much that can be said about and it is worthy of remembrance.  However, it seems to me that it is being way overdone.  Osama bin Laden is dead, but we are allowing both political parties to continue to use this event to justfiy an everincreasing national security and surveillance state that is taking away our liberties. </p>
<p>Numerous other nations have had more die than we did from terrorism on 9/11, but managed to keep some perspective and treat the matter as one of policing rather than national hysteria, which was already manipulated once to get us into the utterly stupid war in Iraq.  Even though the Bush admin officially admitted that Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11, Cheney kept on claiming that he did, and 64% of those voting for Bush 8 years ago believed that he did.   </p>
<p>Here are some things more worthy of remembrance than 9/11, but which will not get even remotely as much attention:    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>1)  Monday, Sept. 17 will be the 225th anniversary of the adoption of the US constitution.<br />2) That same day will also be the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in US history, with over 23,000 dead on its battlefield, which inspired President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed (most of) US slaves.  Needless to say, that is a lot more dead than on 9/11 and with a much more worthy and important outcome.    <br />Then in terms of sheer numbers of pointless dead, with us arguably being possibly able to do something about them, if not all that likely:    <br />3) Between 2000 and 2009, 298,000 Americans died of gunshot wounds.  Many of those were suicides, others were homicides, others were family accidents.  We have half the world&#8217;s guns and are far ahead of any other country on this matter (with some competition from a few with war happening on their soil).    <br />4)  During the same period, 417,000 Americans died in automobile accidents.    </p>
<p>So, let us remember 9/11, but let us keep it in perspective compared to more important things, and let us not allow it to be used for evil purposes.</p>

<p>Bartlett: <em>Mitt Romney, Carried Interest and Capital Gains</em><br />New York Times:  <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/mitt-romney-carried-interest-and-capital-gains/">Mitt Romney, Carried Interest and Capital Gains</a>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Bartlett">Bruce Bartlett</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A key reason for Mr. Romney’s low tax rate is that a very substantial amount of his income comes from capital gains – 51% in 2011 and 58% in 2010. Capital gains, no matter how large, are taxed at a maximum rate of 15%, whereas wage income can be taxed as much as 35% by the income tax plus taxes for Medicare and Social Security. The latter two are not assessed on capital gains.<br />The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/opinion/more-tax-tricks-private-equity-style.html">recently commented</a> in an editorial that while the carried interest loophole is unjustified, the core problem is lower tax rates on capital gains generally. Said The Times, “As long as income from investments is taxed at a lower rate than income from work, there will be no stopping the search for ways, legal or otherwise, to pay the lower rate.”<br />The view that capital gains should be treated as ordinary income for tax purposes is one that is widely shared by liberal tax reformers. They got their wish, briefly, from 1987 to 1990 because Ronald Reagan agreed to raise the tax rate on capital gains to 28% from 20% in return for a reduction in the top rate on ordinary income to 28% from 50%, as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.<br />There are three big problems, however, with taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>First, even if that were the case, capital gains would still be treated more beneficially, because the taxes only apply to realized gains. &#8230;<br />Second, there is a problem with inflation insofar as capital gains are concerned. Many <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2143878">academic studies</a> have shown that a considerable portion of realized capital gains simply represent inflation, rather than real increases in purchasing power. &#8230;<br />Third, it is a fact of life that those with great wealth are the principal beneficiaries of the capital gains tax preference, and they exercise influence in our political system far out of proportion to their numbers. &#8230;<br />[I]t is a pipe dream to believe that eliminating the capital gains preference is the key to fixing the carried interest loophole. It can and should be addressed by treating carried interest as ordinary income, without requiring that all capital gains be taxed as ordinary income.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whistleblower gets millions: good for compliance improvement (and makes us ask again&#8211;did Romney get amnesty?)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Birkenfeld">Bradley Birkenfeld</a>, the UBS whistleblower who helped jumpstart the IRS&#8217;s enforcement of foreign bank account reporting and helped catch criminal tax evaders, ended up serving a relatively short prison term (for failure to be entirely forthcoming, in the case of one of UBS&#8217;s private banking customers) but also go a significant $104 million whistleblower award.  See David Kocieniewski, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/business/whistle-blower-awarded-104-million-by-irs.html">Whistle-Blower awarded $104 Million by I.R.S</a>., New York Times (Sept. 11, 2012); <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/9/12/whistleblower_brad_birkenfeld_rewarded_record_104m">Whistleblower Brad Birkenfeld Rewarded Record $104M for Exposing How UBS Helped Rich Evade Taxes</a>, DemocracyNow.org (video available); <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/7/31/exhaustive_study_finds_global_elite_hiding">Exhaustive Study Finds Global Elite Hiding Up to $32 Trillion in Offshore Accounts</a>, DemocracyNow.org (July 12, 2012) (video or transcript available); <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/09/whistleblowing">Birkenfeld&#8217;s bonanza</a>, The Economist (Sept. 11, 2012).</p>
<p>As Birkenfeld&#8217;s attorney put it:<br />
<blockquote>“Today is a great day for all the honest Americans out there who work their job and pay their taxes. Today is a great day for tax fairness. Today is a terrible day for big-time tax cheats.”  <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/09/whistleblowing">Birkenfeld&#8217;s bonanza</a>, The Economist (Sept. 11, 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>The very public and very large whistleblower award should do two things:</p>
<p>1) encourage other insiders who are aware of egregious company or individual tax-evading behavior to blow the whistle and</p>
<p>2) discourage other insiders and companies from egregious company or individual tax evading behavior.<br />There have always been anonymous brown-envelope tips to the IRS from those who know what is going on but don&#8217;t want to participate in it and don&#8217;t want their competitors to gain a competitive advantage because they do.  But whistleblowers generally have access to inside information that can break the dam on enforcement.  That certainly was the case with Birkenfeld, whose information&#8211; about smuggling diamonds for UBS&#8217;s private banking clients and other means taken to help such clients avoid reporting their assets to the US government&#8211;was instrumental in increasing awareness about tax crimes and increasing the fear of God (or rather, the fear of the &#8220;revenuer&#8221;) in sophisticated, wealthy taxpayers who had been able to hide some of their assets and wealth relatively easily before.</p>
<p><em>By the way&#8211;we still do not know whether GOP presidential candidate <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-part-ii.html">Mitt Romney</a> participated in the amnesty program that was introduced in the wake of the UBS exposure of banking secrecy&#8217;s connection to tax evasion by wealthy Americans.  As most Americans know by now, Romney refuses to release his tax returns for the relevant years when he might have participated in the amnesty program to avoid criminal prosecution. </em><br /><em></em><br /><a name="more"></a><em><br /></em><br /><em> Until he does release his returns back to 2003 o4 so, there will continue to be questions regarding his taxes, as the wealthiest nominee ever with offshore holdings galore and his sole business experience being a hedge fund with numerous offshore entities and blocker corporations.  Specifically, Americans will wonder how his self-proclaimed patriotism and love of nation plays out in his ordinary decisions.  His hedge fund, Bain Capital, has also made the news as a participant in a claimed conspiracy of hedge funds to deflate the prices they pay for companies they acquire.  See Lichtblau &#038; Lattman, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/business/documents-depict-equity-firms-like-bain-as-colluding.html?pagewanted=all">Equity Firms Like Bain Are Depicted as Colluding</a>, New York Times (Sept. 11, 2012).   </em><br /><em><br /></em><em>Both tax evasion and price-rigging are criminal activities, so it behooves Romney to release his returns and ancillary information so Americans can assess how he practices what he preaches in terms of love of country and rule of law.  Did he report his foreign assets as required all along?  Did he invest abroad (so that any purported &#8220;job creation&#8221; activity didn&#8217;t benefit us)?  Was he still influential in Bain during the period that it began, or carried on, price-fixing agreements with other powerful hedge funds?  Americans deserve to know.</em><br /><em><br /></em>Will this lead to better compliance in the future?  One suspects that there will always be those who enjoy the game of avoiding taxes so much that they will be willing to pay to play the tax evasion games even on the harder-to-manipulate playing field created by the crackdown on banking secrecy and offshoring of funds.  But hopefully they will be fewer, and less successful! </p>

<div>After expressing sorrow about the deaths, Mr. Romney told reporters on the campaign trail that the Obama administration had tried to appease Islamic extremists who should have been condemned instead. He said a statement issued by the American Embassy in Cairo before the deaths criticizing an anti-Islamic video was “akin to an apology” and a “severe miscalculation.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">“The first response of the United States must be outrage at the breach of the sovereignty of our nation, and apology for American values is never the right course,” Mr. Romney said, speaking at a campaign stop in Jacksonville, Fla. He added, “They clearly sent mixed messages to the world.”
</p>
</div>

<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/us/politics/attacks-fuel-escalation-in-presidential-race.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;pagewanted=all">Embassy Attack Fuels Escalation in U.S. Presidential Race</a></i>, Peter Baker, New York Times, today
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>For the last few days I’d thought that all Obama had to do to wrap up this election was run ads showing clips of Romney’s <a href="http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/romney-ryan-tax-loopholes.php">bizarre interview</a>on last Sunday’s Meet the Press—e.g., “Well, the specifics [of the tax plan] are these which is those principles I described are the heart of my policy.”—maybe juxtaposed with clips of Romney’s speech to the Detroit Economic Club last February in which he identified some specifics, er, principles.  (Or is it principles, er, specifics?  Hard to tell, with such specific principles.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And I still think that an ad of that sort would do the trick.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But I also now think that a precise, appropriate response by Obama to Romney’s weird statement would effectively end Romney’s election chances.  It is, after all, hard to imagine a more dangerous statement by a president, and therefore by a presidential candidate, than the pronouncement that America’s values—America’s <i>values</i>— include wanting Americans to deliberately offend the world’s Muslims. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney apparently believes that it’s fine to risk American lives overseas (including, presumably, members of our military) by appearing to support such pointlessly offensive provocation.  Obama should point this out, even if the news media doesn’t.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But Obama also shouldn’t allow the detachment of those comments by Romney, which indicate pretty starkly that Romney doesn’t understand even the concept of diplomacy, from the implications of those comments in spheres beyond foreign policy and defense.  I’ve wondered for a while now why the Obama campaign hasn’t emphasized more Romney’s persistent habit of drawing conclusions based upon erroneous fact or upon no facts at all. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The very essence of Romney’s candidacy, at least originally, was his claimed cool-headed judgment and problem-solving ability.  Yet time and again he appears unable to accurately or adequately assess basic facts and understand even the most obvious implications of those facts—and of his own statements and conduct.  What has been apparent to me for nearly a year now, and what this incident should now clarify for the general public, is that Romney is not prompted to action—whether in foreign policy, defense, the economy, or anything else—by anything other than immediate opportunism and his adopted ideology.  And that, even worse, he seems unable even to <i>understand</i> the implications of what he says, what he proposes and what he does.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don’t see how his election hopes can survive his comments of yesterday and today. 
</p>

                                <p>The Wall Street Journal is running an article where they suggest that sales of the new i Phone could boost US real GDP growth. </p>
<p>http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443696604577645920875813322.html<br />ased firm</p>
<p>But the i Phone is built in China by a Taiwanese based firm.  So the consumer and business spending on the new i Phone will be offset in the GDP accounts by imports of the i Phone, making it a wash in the GDP accounts.</p>
<p>You would think that the Wall Street Journal would know this.   I guess this is just another example of how under the new ownership the low standards of the Wall Street Journal editorial page are spreading into its  news coverage.</p>

                                <p>John Quiggin writes at  <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2012/09/10/the-white-working-class/">Crooked Timber</a> on a not new discussion on what constitutes &#8220;white working class&#8221; or &#8220;whiteworkingclass&#8221; used in media descriptions.  In comments there are several who tackle the question well&#8230;.Bruce Wilder for one.  I am not sure there is a clear answer without considering geographical issues and histories, rural/city/suburb issues, and such, but has implications for who we notice as important.</p>
<blockquote><p>All became clear(or, at least, clearer) when I discovered that US political discussion uses two very different (though correlated) concepts of “working class”. The first is the more or less standard one – people who depend on wage labor (normally in manual or low-status service occupations) for their income. The second, specific to the US, and standard in most political polling, is “people without a 4-year college degree”, a class which includes such horny-handed sons and daughters of toil as Bill Gates and Paris Hilton. More prosaically, it includes lots of small business owners, and (since college graduation rates were rising until relative recently), over-represents the old.</p>
<p>Data on US voting patterns is surprisingly scarce, but Andrew Gelman has a big data set confirming the point that <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/03/23/voting-patterns-of-americas-whites-from-the-masses-to-the-elites/">Republican voting rises with income</a>&#8230;<br />&#8230;<br />As the pie chart below illustrates, the biggest group in the Republican voting base, and the group with which they do best is that of middle/high income whites without college degrees (the percentage after the group name gives the Republican share of the vote for that group). There’s nothing surprising in this, since all three variables are correlated with Republican voting. It’s the practice of calling this group “working class” that causes the confusion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Choosing Mitt is beyond me&#8230;.&#8217;not sure&#8217; might involve George Bush, but if memory serves he declared it &#8216;unimportant&#8217; sometime in 2008.  No matter one&#8217;s view on the matter, REALLY?</p>

<div>[A]n unusually high foreign tax credit in 2008 raises questions about the size and source of Mr. Romney’s foreign income that year and how it was treated for tax purposes. </div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/25/business/in-romneys-tax-return-clues-in-foreign-taxes.html?pagewanted=all&#038;gwh=2EA44D8EF70AEE179F919EB469FBAC40">Tax Credits Shed Light on Romney</a></i>,* James B. Stewart, New York Times, Aug, 24</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don’t follow finance-industry news very closely, and the only technical knowledge I have about U.S. tax law for foreign income is what I’ve read in the last few months concerning the foreign bank accounts that Romney’s 2010 income tax return shows he had in 2009.  Including his UBS account, which was opened in (if I recall correctly) 2003 and had $3 million in it at the end of 2009.  That account was managed by a trustee, a Boston lawyer and close friend of the Romney’s, who apparently closed the account in 2010; the account doesn’t appear in Romney’s 2011 tax-return estimate. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So it is only because of the controversy surrounding Romney’s tax returns and offshore bank accounts that I even know about the 2009 IRS amnesty program for Americans who evaded U.S. income taxes by hiding income in foreign bank accounts, and that why the program was initiated: UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank had been forced to identify thousands of U.S. citizens who had accounts there, many of whom, the IRS presumed accurately, had used the bank to evade payment of U.S. taxes.  The large number of identified evaders would make it difficult to prosecute them all; thus the temporary amnesty program.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’d wondered how this all had come about so suddenly, but hadn’t bothered to research it.  But I learned <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/jailed-banker-helped-crack-swiss-142921849.html">the answer today</a>.  An American-born UBS banker named Bradley Birkenfeld decided in 2007 to try to cash in on a newly-enacted whistleblower statute that would garner him 30% of the taxes that the IRS recouped as a result of the information he provided.  He hoped also to trade his information for immunity from criminal prosecution.  Only the monetary goal succeeded.  He was released last month from prison after serving a more-than-three-year sentence. And he was just awarded $104 million under that whistleblower statute.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>According to Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Birkenfeld">Birkenfeld</a>, who was among UBS employees whose job it was, beginning in 2001, to solicit American customers to use the bank to evade U.S. taxes, pled guilty in June 2008 to a single count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, but he was not sentenced until August 2009.  He spent the intervening 14 months earning the $104 million that he will now be paid, most of it the result of the amnesty program, which reportedly was <i>very</i>successful.  “In February 2009, UBS paid $780 million to resolve a criminal tax avoidance investigation. It also admitted to assisting 17,000 clients evade their taxes through the use of offshore accounts between 2000 and 2007,” Wikipedia says.  “In July 2009, to avoid additional fines, UBS agreed to provide the names of 5,000 Americans who had offshore accounts with UBS.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The New York Times article from which I quote above was published on the Saturday before the start of the Republican convention and best as I can tell received little attention.  So let me give it some.  All with the caveat that I probably don’t know what I’m talking about when I conclude that the information in the article seems to suggest, if I understand it correctly, that in 2008, when the U.S. and European economies were collapsing, Romney suddenly paid a seemingly inexplicable $800,000 in foreign income taxes, “far more than any other year,” as indicated in the 2010 tax returns.  Stewart writes that Romney “reported <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/25/business/25stewart-doc.html#document/p1/a69311" title="Related line from Form 1040 of Romney tax return.">more than $800,000 in taxable refunds</a> from 2009, which seems very high.” 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stewart wondered how Romney’s blind trust could have earned such amounts in foreign countries and generated such large tax credits,” and so he consulted to experts,  <a href="https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/profile.cfm?section=bio&#038;personID=20283" title="Professor’s biography on N.Y.U. Web site.">Daniel Shaviro</a>, professor of taxation at New York University School of Law, and <a href="http://web.law.umich.edu/_facultybiopage/facultybiopagenew.asp?id=337" title="Professor’s biography on university Web site.">James R. Hines Jr.</a>, a professor of international taxation at the University of Michigan Law School. “One possibility,” Stewart says, “is that the financial crisis and resulting bleak economic outlook caused Mr. Romney’s trustee to cash in long-held, appreciated foreign assets. Another possibility is that they resulted from some kind of more elaborate tax shelter, or some combination of the two.”  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Might one other possibility be that Romney suddenly paid several years’ back taxes to foreign governments in 2008 or 2009?  After all, although people like me were unaware of the Birkenfeld matter, people like Romney and like the trustee of the Swiss account of course were.  (Is Romney trying to protect the reputation of his friend, the trustee?)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The large foreign tax credit for 2009, Shaviro told Stewart, “has baffled tax experts.”  It “makes no sense to me at all’.” But, Shaviro said, the IRS has challenged many tax-shelter “deals intended to generate foreign tax credits.”  And Hines said, “Lots of people are speculating about the source of this tax credit, but at this point it’s just conjecture.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Conjecture, yes.  And I’m not even an expert.  But conjecture about this sure is fun.

<p>Romer&#8217;s deficit reduction suggestions worth a read</p>
<p>Christina Romer&#8217;s recent piece in the New York Times is worth reading.  See C.D. Romer, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/business/cutting-the-deficit-compassionately-economic-view.html">Cutting the Deficit, with Compassion</a>, New York Times at BU5 (Sept. 9, 2012).</p>
<p>Now, I generally have found Romer too willing to advocate austerity economics and too unwilling to support progressive tax policies.  But nonetheless, this piece hits some good notes.  For example, while arguing that reducing the deficit needs to be a priority, she acknowledges that it must be done &#8220;in a way that does as little harm as possible to people, jobs and economic opportunity.&#8221;  Similarly, she recognizes that requires going slowly&#8211;&#8221; a comprehensive, aggressive deficit reduction plan [should be passed] as soon as possible, but the actual spending cuts and tax increases should be phased in as the economy recovers.&#8221;  Why?  Because &#8220;[a] crude rule of thumb is that every $100 billion of deficit reduction will cost close to a million jobs in the near term.&#8221;  A big price to pay that makes it reasonable to consider not only LONG-TERM deficit reduction plans but also SHORT-TERM job creation measures.</p>
<p>(Linda here<em>&#8230;  And in case you wonder, tax cuts for the wealthiest amongst us, as advocated by the Romney-Ryan team&#8211;are NOT job creation measures.  The Romney-Ryan budget proposes to achieve revenue neutrality, huge tax cuts for the rich, and no tax cuts for the middle class by not proposing any specifics.  The reality is that the Romney-Ryan plan is just politico-wishspeaking:  there is no plan that will do what they claim, because they depend on the now-well-disproven idea that huge tax cuts for the wealthy will generate more tax revenues while creating more jobs.  Nope.  Neither likely nor even possible.  And by not specifying what they&#8217;d cut, they are merely trying to fool the people.)</em><br /><em><br /></em> Here are what Romer proposes in italics, with some commentary after:</p>
<p>1) <i>tax credits for businesses that actually increase employment</i></p>
<p>Not a bad idea to replace the endless suggestions of business tax cuts, but any accountability will have to be long-term&#8211;i.e., payroll will have to increase over a period of 2 years and the particular jobs created will have to stay in place for at least 2 years before any tax reward should be available</p>
<p>2) <i>&#8220;well-designed tax reform that raises at least some additional revenue&#8221; and &#8220;let[s] the <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/senate-votes-at-4-today-725-on-obama-tax-cut-proposal.html">Bush tax cuts</a> expire for those earning more than $250,000 a year [while] [i]ncreasing rates on top earners&#8221; and &#8220;lowering tax expenditures&#8221; including &#8220;the low tax rate on capital gains and dividends&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Hmmmm.The clarion call for tax reform has consistently been used by DC lobbyists to push for <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/senate-votes-at-4-today-725-on-obama-tax-cut-proposal.html">tax CUTS</a> for the wealthy and big business.  It is not so clear that we need a huge tax reform.  What is usually meant by tax reform is &#8220;simplification,&#8221; which is just another way to justify unneeded tax cuts  .We do not need to cut the corporate tax rate.  We do not need to reduce tax regulations. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But I do agree with Romer&#8217;s notion that we need some tax increases.  My preference would be to allow the entire panoply of Bush tax cuts&#8211;passed by a Congress that unfortunately and wrongly believed the Laffer lie that cutting taxes would increase revenues&#8211;to expire as the Republicans originally purported to intend.  Let the sunset happen.  And then come next year, think about what, if any, of the cuts make sense. Perhaps a cut to the income tax rates of those who make less than $100,000 a year.  But an increase for those that make more than that, and a significant increase for the top two quintiles, would be in order.  We should raise rates on the wealthiest by creating additional tax brackets for those making 500,000 to a million, 1-2 million, 2-10 million, and above 10 million.   We could reasonably examine the many tax expenditures/subsidies in the Code and begin to cut back on them&#8211;starting with the capital gains rate preference, and moving through the exorbitant support for wealthy mortgages (limit it to an interest deduction on the first $250,000 of mortgage interest and phase that out for anyone with an income above $500,000) and including the R&#038;D credit (rather than deduction), the &#8220;active financing exception&#8221; and the subsidy for moving active businesses offshore (and along with that, eliminating any idea that there is such a thing as a &#8220;profits&#8221; partner who isn&#8217;t taxed on a &#8220;transfer&#8221; of a partnership interest at the time the interest is provided).</p>
<p>3)<i> slowing spending growth for government health care spending- by reducing overpayments to health care providers (as the $716 billion cut misrepresented by the GOP does); by increasing those cost-cutting reforms to find other ways that we are inefficient; by &#8220;making the wealthy pay a larger share of their Medicare costs and gradually raising the Medicare eligibility age&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Here we see the problem that no one in government dares to say what must be said&#8211;that until we move to a single-payer system like the rest of the advanced world, we will see private parties continuing to rip off rent profits from providing health care.  We must eventually expand to &#8220;medicare for all&#8221;&#8211;and we should do that soon.  In the transition, it would be reasonable to have a means-adjusted payment scale, so that the Medicare tax is higher for those with more income (corresponding to the increased brackets for the income tax).  And it might be reasonable to have a few major categories of jobs for determining base retirement age&#8211;workers in steel plants who work in 115 degree interiors when it is 90+ degrees outside likely should retire earlier than workers in academia who work at their desks in air-conditioned offices.  But that won&#8217;t be easy and will need to be developed by consensus over some reasonable time, rather than through partisan, anti-worker politics.</p>
<p>4) <i>cut other spending&#8211;protecting children, displaced workers, and wounded veterans in the process,as well as money for education (including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell_Grant">Pell grants</a>) and infrastructure and scientific research&#8211;but cutting &#8220;agricultural price supports and subsidized crop insurance programs that mainly benefit large commercial farmers,&#8221; the Pentagon&#8217;s budget, and high-speed rail.</i><br /><i><br /></i> We certainly can cut a lot of waste and warmongering out of the Pentagon&#8217;s budget, which is one reason that I&#8217;m all for letting the sequester approved by Republicans go through.  We could save a great deal there that could be used for infrastructure and other spending that builds opportunities and jobs instead of supporting the military-industrial complex.  I&#8217;d also support  cutting most of the agricultural subsidies, which primarily support Agribusiness that produces tasteless food at a high environmental cost.  But I disagree strongly on high-speed rail.  If we don&#8217;t as a nation invest in transportation infrastructure that moves us beyond the costly highways (costly in human lives, dollars to build and maintain, and environmental degradation), we will not advance our economy as we must.</p>
