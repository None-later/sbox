                                <p>Well the gloves came off this morning. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/02/gop.stimulus.worries/index.html">What GOP Leaders deem wasteful in Senate stimulus bill</a><br />
<blockquote>STORY HIGHLIGHTS<br />House Republicans unveil list of &#8220;wasteful&#8221; Senate stimulus spending<br />Stimulus bill passed in the House without any Republican support<br />One provision: A $246 million tax break for Hollywood movie producers<br />Another concern: $75 million for salaries of employees at the FBI</p></blockquote>
<p>I have listed all the line items below the fold divided into five categories. 1)  &#8216;Spending that could use some explanation&#8217; This includes that Hollywood tax break (hint the four words left out of Highlights make a difference) 2) Equipment purchases 3) Building and Infrastructure 4) Public Health 5) Jobs.</p>
<p>Let us set some parameters. There is a distinction between &#8216;wasteful&#8217;  and &#8216;inefficient&#8217;. That is there is spending that may not meet somebody&#8217;s policy preferences (wasteful)  but still has stimulative effects over the short term. And then there is spending that everyone agrees would be useful but which doesn&#8217;t go into effect fast enough. If you look at the Republican list as it shows in the original story these two categories are blurred and blended with no real explanations as to which they consider which.</p>
<p>Jobs. $3.185 billion If the major challenge facing us short term is unemployment then direct spending on jobs is a pretty efficient way to inject money into the system. And certainly better than just extending unemployment insurance (though we need to do some of that too). Which makes Republican opposition on this front a little odd to start with, particularly when we examine the first three line items. $1 billion for the Census. Well this is one of the very few specific Constitutional mandates, we have to do it good times or bad, as it happens we will be needing census workers right at the point we are projecting our greatest rate of unemployment. Exactly how does this fall in the category of &#8216;wasteful&#8217;? Particularly since there is a $3 billion gap between authorization and projected costs? I don&#8217;t get it. $75 million for FBI salaries. We got news stories last week showing that the FBI was aware of major mortgage fraud but had diverted existing resources to counterterror duties. Unless you believe that Wall Street reformed itself overnight it is hard to see why this is in any sense &#8216;wasteful&#8217;. Not only do we need the Agents this translates directly to jobs. $650 million for wildfire management. Translation: fire crews. In recent years for whatever reason the fire season has been getting longer and more destructive and the Forest Service has consistently blown through its fire fighting budget requiring diversions from other programs. Plus these are great opportunities to get young workers into the work force in jobs that allow on the job training. Economic efficiency and public safety combined, yet it made the list. The other three line items which total $1.46 billion merit some discussion but all translate directly into jobs that offer on the job training and which also can be put in place quickly. The GOP seems to be straining here.</p>
<p>Public Health $500 million dollars. Prevention of STDs $400 million. Prevention of any infectious disease translates to productivity improvements. The apparent basis for including this on the list is that the GOP would rather have people get sick than let women have access to reproductive controls. It is all about the condoms. The remaining $100 million is for smoking cessation and tribal alcohol abuse. You can make the economic argument for either but really this is a joke. We are talking about .012% of the package here. It just seems that the GOP hates spending any tax money on public goods.</p>
<p>Building and infrastructure. At $10.6 billion by far the largest category. And while you can argue the merits of spending $6 billion upgrading Federal buildings to make them more &#8220;green&#8221; (which sounds more wasteful than calling it what it is &#8220;more energy efficient&#8221;) all of these projects translate directly into jobs. It is just hard to see the economic argument at work here. Plus you have to have a heart as hard as a stone to reach way down into the package to highlight $5.5 million in spending at the VA National Cemetary Administration. That is .0006% of the total. (And yes the money is probably going to be spent at headquarters, but still the symbolism stinks).</p>
<p>Equipment. $1.8 billion. Maybe the Coast Guard doesn&#8217;t need a new icebreaker. On the other hand polar nations are in a scramble to establish claims to newly reachable gas and oil resources on the Arctic Sea floor. $88 million doesn&#8217;t seem like a lot to spend to beef up our arctic presence. I have no idea why this made the cut. But the rest is pretty explicable. The Republicans have always hated Amtrak ($850 million) and typically poo-poo &#8220;green&#8221; anything including alternative energy vehicles ($800 million). But it is hard to see the economic argument against any of this.</p>
<p>Which leaves us with $2.9 billion in what reasonably could be seen as pork. $2 billion for a clean coal plant defunded last year on grounds of &#8220;inefficiency&#8221;. Maybe Dr. Chu has some ideas about how to correct the problem but it doesn&#8217;t look good on the surface. $650 million on TV convertor boxes. Well there is a public policy case to be made here, but considering the units are probably made in Malaysia or China, the economic case seems shakier. And that tax break for Hollywood producers. Like those guys need more money. On the other hand the actual tax break is for buying motion picture film. So maybe there is an economic case to be made that this creates jobs. On the Left Coast. So it is easy to see why this made the cut. But $2.9 billion is only about .4% of the whole package.</p>
<p>In fact if we add it all together (which the original article doesn&#8217;t) we are a shade under $19 billion or 2.15%. Sorry this is not an economic argument for waste or inefficiency, they simply threw everything they could into the mix and created a laundry list to give some cover to their real agenda. Which is as it has always been-tax cuts for the wealthy.</p>

<p>has been rather harsh on efforts to base macroeconomics on models of rational forward looking utility maximisers in Nash or Walrasian equilibrium recently.</p>
<p>One might almost think that I agree with my PhD supervisor Larry Summers who once said and I quote from memory (but believe me the words had enough of an impact that I remember them and where we were and who else was there).</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I think ? I think that in the history of economic theory the day in which they came up with the idea of the utility function wasn&#8217;t an especially good day.&#8221;</p>
<p>To make things clear, I do think that major insights have been obtained by economists who introduced the concept of the utlity function not just to economics but also to macroeconomics.  The problem is that I almost think that those economists are named either Milton or Friedman.  After the jump, I will attempt to argue that the concept of the utility function is sometimes useful and sometimes even useful to people trying to study aggregates.</p>
<p>First of all, context.  Larry was proposing an effort to explain the S&#038;P 500 index using models of deterministic chaos.  Existing models with chaotic dynamics had no forward looking element &#8212; they were models of weather or insect populations and no one assumed that either clouds or grasshoppers had rational expectations.  </p>
<p>So I read up on deterministic chaos and programmed up the models he considered.  They generated time series.  The time series didn&#8217;t look like the S&#038;P because they were highly predictable.  I concluded that you really have to consider agents who look at the data and try to predict the future and can tell if there is a simple pattern.  My version is that these agents eliminated the simple cycles and left the chaotic dynamics because they couldn&#8217;t figure them out.  But see I was back to agents with an objective who were at least learning.</p>
<p>Of course my discovery can be found in basically every introductory micro textbook.</p>
<p>OK so what about Milton and Friedman.  I&#8217;d say he had two major contributions which have something to do with considering economic agents&#8217; objectives.  One is the accelerationist critique of the Phillips curve (see &#8220;The role of monetary policy&#8221; a presidential address in the AER).  Here he says that the old Phillips curve which related nominal wage growth to unemployment and nothing else couldn&#8217;t possibly be an economic law true in all times and all places, because incentives all concern real wages and it&#8217;s just not possible that people won&#8217;t notice a constant inflation rate of x%.  Note, this is a critique of the totally stubborn and dumb expectations hypothesis.  You don&#8217;t have to assume rational expectations to conclude that expectations have something to do with reality.</p>
<p>Good point.  Definitely a true claim as the Phillips curve fit UK data and, as noted by Samuelson and Solow US data but didn&#8217;t fit German data from 1918 through 1924 so well.  </p>
<p>Ned Phelps made the same point, so I have to admit that the concept of the objective function was put to good use by macroeconomists whose last name begins with the same sound as the phrase &#8220;false dawn&#8221;.</p>
<p>then there is the permanent income hypothesis.  Here the glass is definitely at least half full.  It is really true that economists struggled to explain strange patterns in the data, all of which seemed to be not in the slightest strange once Friedman and Franco Modigliani (OK macroeconomists one of whose names begins with the same sound as the phrase &#8220;false dawn&#8221;) began thinking about consumption savings choice as a problem in optimization.</p>
<p>For example, why is it that the rich save a larger fraction of their income than the poor yet as the economy grows and people on average get richer the ratio of consumption to income stays about the same (or later grew) ?</p>
<p>Why do African Americans have a higher savings rate than European Americans with the same income ?</p>
<p>Why is there a lower regression coefficient of consumption on income for US farmers than for other Americans ?</p>
<p>All these facts are exactly what you would expect if at least part of consumption corresponded to consumption in the PIH.</p>
<p>Now when one attempts to test the PIH (is the glass fully full) one discovers the same 2 things one always discovers.  When on attempts to test hypotheses based on rational utility maximization one rejects them, but one always has to make auxiliary hypotheses and someone will argue that the rejection was due to the auxiliary hypothesis. </p>
<p>The rejection of the PIH with rational expectations is especially robust as those people will argue that rejection is due to an auxiliary hypothesis, because they can relax that assumption and get to a model in which the null is rejected at the 5% level but not at the 1% level.  </p>
<p>But one can also reject the null that the PIH has nothing to do with consumption along with auxiliary unless and until someone finds a way to explain the stylized facts listed above, without assuming that at least part of consumption of at least some people corresponds to PIH consumption.</p>
<p>Milton Friedman has many disciples.  Have they added a third victory based on applying micro theory to macro ?  This is not a rhetorical question, I am asking for information.</p>

<p>During a recession, what happens to huge country that depended upon exports for its great leap forward? Massive unemployment&#8230;and riots. TimesOnLine recently did <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article5627687.ece" target="_blank">research</a> on the kind of violent spasm now hitting China: &#8220;Violent Unrest Rocks China.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The research was conducted for The Sunday Times over the last two months in three provinces vital to Chinese trade – Guangdong, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. It found that the global economic crisis has scythed through exports and set off dozens of protests that are never mentioned by the state media. </p>
<p>While troubling for the Chinese government, this should strengthen the argument of Premier Wen Jiabao, who will say on a visit to London this week that his country faces enormous problems and cannot let its currency rise in response to American demands.</p></blockquote>
<p>More of the hair that bit the dog.</p>
<p>Having used a peg currency to help it build its export-oriented economy, China, like an old drunk, now is taking another sip to ward off the disastrous hangover. Not healthy, but understandable. As I have said on this blog repeatedly, global growth has to be organic.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yasheng Huang, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said corruption and a deeply flawed model of economic reform had led to a collapse in personal income growth and a wealth gap that could leave China looking like a Latin American economy.</p>
<p>Richard Duncan, a partner at Blackhorse Asset Management in Singapore, has argued that the only way to create consumers is to raise wages to a legal minimum of $5 (£3.50) a day across Asia – a “trickle up” theory. </p></blockquote>
<p>Below is just a sample of the kinds of events occurring throughout the &#8220;three provinces vital to Chinese trade – Guangdong, Zhejiang and Jiangsu.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>Hundreds of workers protested outside the city government so we ordered the boss to settle the back pay and sent police armed with machine-guns to take him to the bank and deliver the money to his workforce that very night,” the official said.</p>
<p>On January 15 there were pitched battles at a textile factory in the nearby city of Dongguan between striking workers and security guards.</p>
<p>On January 16, about 100 auxiliary security officers, known in Chinese as Bao An, staged a street protest after they were sacked by a state-owned firm in Shenzhen, a boom town adjoining Hong Kong.</p>
<p>About 1,000 teachers confronted police on the streets of Yangjiang on January 5, demanding their wages from the local authorities.</p>
<p>In one sample week in late December, 2,000 workers at a Singapore-owned firm in Shanghai held a wage protest and thousands of farmers staged 12 days of mass demonstrations over economic problems outside the city.</p>
<p>All along the coast, angry workers besieged labour offices and government buildings after dozens of factories closed their doors without paying wages and their owners went back to Hong Kong, Taiwan or South Korea. </p></blockquote>
<p>Global growth on both sides of the planet has been ill formed and ill-conceived, a point I have repeatedly made in every way I know how.</p>

                                <p>Megan McArdle <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/02/all_stimulus_all_the_time.php">concludes from &#8220;lowly MBA&#8221; analysis</a> that it is impossible to get a net surplus from public investment.  If lowly MBAs think this, then lowly MBAs faked their way through Introduction to Microeconomics which IIRC was in fact designated Econ 101 at my lowly public university:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;I do not think of spending money to build the bridge as a net increase in the country&#8217;s wealth.  We exchanged money for a bridge worth the money we spent (or so we light-heartedly hope).  One could argue that the bridge would generate more economic value than it cost in taxes and deadweight loss; one could also argue that it will generate less (and Japan has quite a few bridges of this description).  But this is an argument for the bridge, not for bridge-as-stimulus.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>[Added excerpt &#8212; TB:] Assuming that the real interest rate approximates the time preference of said American Taxpayer, and that the bridge is worth exactly what we paid for it, the net economic benefit is zero.  [Emphasis added.]</p></blockquote>
<p>I will grant that public investment demand curves may not always slope downwards, but let&#8217;s assume arguendo that they can.  That is, you can in principle be a good technocrat, take the set of available public investment projects, and order them by decreasing return on investment.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s consider what projects should be pursued.  If you consider funding only the most beneficial project, the good technocrat may find that the project returns, say, 30 percent annually, while someone may be willing to lend the government money for almost nothing.  [Added TB:] This project is, in effect, worth more than society paid for it.  So the project is approved and we move on to the next project.  That project is by construction less beneficial, and if the supply curve for funds slopes upwards, the funding will cost more, too.  Still, chances are the next project will pass muster, too.  We go on and eventually come to a project where the rate of return is just equal to the cost of funds.  So the marginal project indeed has no (or minimal) net benefit, but all of those &#8220;inframarginal&#8221; projects have positive net benefits even at the interest rate that equates marginal benefits and marginal costs.</p>
<p>The &#8220;economic surplus&#8221; is in fact the whole area between the demand and supply curve to the left of the point where marginal benefit equals marginal costs.  The public benefits to the tune the returns on the inframarginal projects above the interest rate, and lenders benefit as a group because most of them would have been willing to lend money for less than the market interest rate.  This is one of the fundamental results you should learn in introductory micro.  The graph McArdle should have seen at some point is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Economic-surpluses.svg">e.g. here</a>.</p>
<p>Now the advanced economics point, and a practical policy consideration behind <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/crowding-out-and-perils-of.html">this post</a>, is that the bridge-as-stimulus to fill an <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/Hzoh/~3/524676849/another-reason-to-avoid-handwringing.html">output gap</a> can be justifiable as a pure helicoptering of money on firms and individuals involved in building the bridge.  Greg Mankiw said so! (*) The bridge as bridge is icing on the cake.</p>
<p>(*) Possibly to his current regret.</p>

                                <p>Those of you who want to argue that something being &#8220;just symbolism&#8221; are invited to consider the fate of &#8220;Aid to Families with Dependent Children.&#8221;</p>
<p>AFDC is clear and precise.  It tells us that we are helping a specific set of people: Families with Dependent Children.  Not just the father and the mother, but the next generation of human capital as well.  The people who are supposed to be the cogs in the engine of capitalism.</p>
<p>A funny thing happened on the way out of &#8220;welfare reform&#8221; (discussed by Robert <a target="blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/welfare-reform-not-disaster.html">here</a> and <a target="blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/welfare-reform-not-disaster-part-ii.html">here</a>): the program got renamed to &#8220;Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.&#8221;  Note that the emphasis is now on the transience of the assistance, and the families are described as &#8220;needy&#8221; before they are families. No mention of children at all; might well be great-grandma and a bunch of septagenerians living on their Social Security checks and whatever they stuffed under the mattress in the manner of <a target="blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/07/02/070702crbo_books_updike?currentPage=all">John Updike&#8217;s father</a>.*</p>
<p>Another &#8220;funny&#8221; thing that happens on the way through welfare reform is that state block grants lead to strange allocations.</p>
<p>There is a version of this in international development; let&#8217;s call it the Easterly Paradox.**  Generally, what you do is look at the aid a country officially received over the past X number of years (X generally >20) and declared with a Harumph! that, if the people had been given that money directly, they would have $XX,XXX each.</p>
<p>What you don&#8217;t bother mentioning is that 85-90% of that money—75% if the country is extremely lucky—went to domestic supppliers of &#8220;intellectual property.&#8221;  That is, it went to U.S. management consulting teams (generally at full retail) who &#8220;taught&#8221; people their method of irrigation or record-keeping or something else that was essential.***</p>
<p>Short version: our foreign aid budget subsidizes domestic firms significantly more than it produces actual foreign aid.</p>
<p>You would think, though, that the same thing would not happen domestically.  But it appears you would be wrong.</p>
<p>Using the recently-released <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab2006_2009.html">Statistical Abstract data</a>, following are graphic displays of the amount of money allocated to TANF that was actually spent as aid from 2003 to 2006. (Click individual graphics to enlarge.)</p>

<p>Note: The following graphic is accurate.  The state of Mississippi in 2004 spent a <em>negative</em> US$7MM on TANF aid.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SXTVW9W1Y-I/AAAAAAAAAPw/qFzOIrj6_Ow/s1600-h/tanf2004.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SXTVW9W1Y-I/AAAAAAAAAPw/qFzOIrj6_Ow/s400/tanf2004.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SXTVWVGFzHI/AAAAAAAAAPo/6uMgV8Y4Y3I/s1600-h/tanf2003.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SXTVWVGFzHI/AAAAAAAAAPo/6uMgV8Y4Y3I/s400/tanf2003.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>In summary, for the four years of most recent data, the U.S. has averaged spending less than 50% of the monies allocated to TANF on providing actual Assistance to Needy Families.</p>
<p>The next time someone tells you we spend too much money on helping people, point out that most of that money goes to people who are employed as administrators, counselor, and finance officers.</p>
<p>*Let&#8217;s ignore the anecdotal evidence that, if there was one reason that Naderites kept citing for their opposition to Gore, it was &#8220;welfare reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>**Pause while three people get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easterlin_paradox">the joke</a>.</p>
<p>***See Paul O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s exasperation in Ron Susskind&#8217;s <em>The Price of Loyalty</em> when he tried to explain that transporting water to a village on a small scale would cost $25,000, not the $25MM-ish that Arthur Andersen had told the local leaders.</p>

<p>I argued that the conventional view that welfare reform was a success is based on the coincidence that the economy boomed right after welfare war reformed, the journalists stopped paying attention, not noticing the following increase in severe poverty during the Bush non boom.</p>
<p>Now we are in a severe recession.  How is the reformed welfare system working ?  According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/us/02welfare.html?_r=1">Jason DeParle&#8217;s article in the New York Times</a> it is a disaster.</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON — Despite soaring unemployment and the worst economic crisis in decades, 18 states cut their welfare rolls last year, and nationally the number of people receiving cash assistance remained at or near the lowest in more than 40 years.</p>
<p>The trends, based on an analysis of new state data collected by The New York Times, raise questions about how well a revamped welfare system with great state discretion is responding to growing hardships.</p></blockquote>
<p>DeParle doesn&#8217;t theorize, but I can&#8217;t help guessing that states are tossing people off welfare, because they are under budgetary pressure and the very poor are very politically weak.  Some might believe that TANF should be eliminated, but I don&#8217;t see how anyone can defend the present system which gives less assistance when there is more need and presses people harder to get jobs when it is much more nearly impossible for them to find them.</p>
<p>DeParle does note that &#8220;The economic stimulus bills pending in Congress would provide matching grants — estimated at $2.5 billion over two years — to states with caseload expansions.&#8221;  Oh wow, if matched by state funds that would be even more than $600 per year per recipient.  Time to open a cadillac dealership.</p>

<p>Wow an argument in favor of protection from Paul Krugman.  I never expected to read that.  Now he&#8217;s against protection all the same, but he does admit that there is a good argument that right now a bit of protection would be good for the world.  </p>
<p>The argument, basically, is that governments aren&#8217;t coordinating macro policy and that, if stimuli spill out, then they won&#8217;t stimulate enough so everyone will be better off if every country keeps its stimulus to itself.  He concludes however, that protection would be a bad policy, because once countries start they don&#8217;t stop so a little bit of protection right now is not an option.  Anyway it&#8217;s brief so <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/protectionism-and-stimulus-wonkish/">read it.</a></p>
<p>Nick Rowe has <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2009/02/paul-krugman-implicitly-assumes-fixed-exchange-rates.html">an interesting counter argument</a>.  He argues that if all countries are in a liquidity trap, then fiscal stimuli don&#8217;t spill over.  </p>
<p>According to Krugman &#8220;His argument is based on the proposition that since interest rates are fixed under a liquidity trap, capital flows are fixed, and the exchange rate will adjust to offset any change in the trade balance.&#8221;  I will comment on this alleged argument.  Rowe&#8217;s post refers to a paper which I haven&#8217;t read.  Actually the post seems less sophisticated than Krugman&#8217;s presentation, as Rowe seems to argue that flexible exchange rates always imply balanced trade. He can&#8217;t be arguing that, and I haven&#8217;t read the paper.</p>
<p>The argument that this is true specifically if we are in a liquidity trap seems to be specific to Rowe as presented by Krugman.</p>
<p>Rowe&#8217;s argument as presented by Krugman seems backward to me (from now on &#8220;he&#8221; means Rowe as presented by Krugman).  Basically he seems to be arguing that demand for say 3 month t-bills is very elastic and so the price of 3 month t-bills won&#8217;t change and so the amount of 3 month t-bills in investors&#8217; portfolios won&#8217;t change &#8212; that is he is going from the assumption  people are willing to shift huge amounts of wealth into 3 month t-bills to the conclusion that people won&#8217;t shift any wealth into t-bills.  </p>
<p>I repeat this argument in various ways after the jump.</p>
<p>The evidence that we are in a liquidity trap is simply that short safe rates are approximately zero.  However, the application in macro models is the assumption that, therefore, safe short term interest rates won&#8217;t increase if more short term public bonds are issued.  That seems to me to be the same as the assumption that people and firms are willing to buy much more of them.  </p>
<p>For some reason, Rowe assumes that this applies only to domestic people and firms and that whatever makes investors so eager to buy short term public debt is confined nation by nation.  Not to put to fine a point on it, this strikes me as absolutely absurd given, for example the fact that UBS is endangered by the US real estate bubble and that AIG was brought down by its London office.  </p>
<p>The argument is interest rates are fixed because a miniscule change in interest rates would cause a huge flow therefore changes in interest rates will be miniscule therefore flows will be miniscule.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d say this is  a case of the dear old Mundell Fleming model overcoming common sense as if it were an RBC model.</p>
<p>The same goes for the anchoring model.  </p>
<p>s = sbar + (i*-i)/k</p>
<p>s is the exchange rate, sbar a steady state exchange rate determined long after the recession and stimulus are over, i domestic interest, i* foreign interest rate and k a constant.  </p>
<p> Krugman assumes that k is constant which, for one thing, implies  that capital flows are linear in interest rates.  Does that assumption seem reasonable right now ?  seems to me that an interest rate fluctuating between 0 and 10 basis points is a strong time that k is a bit low right now.</p>
<p>However I guess k doesn&#8217;t matter to Krugman.  I guess that Krugman&#8217;s argument amounts to saying that with constant interest rates, bonds become perfect substitutes so the amounts of different bonds that people will hold (tried to avoid writing &#8220;stock of bonds&#8221; there) can change a lot and balance large trade deficits at a fixed relative price.  That is Krugman is ahead of me as <strike>usual</strike> always so far.</p>

<p>Which pot is calling which kettle black? The &#8220;Made in America&#8221; has caused quite a stir among vested interest groups, among them China and a number of our industries now profiting from Chinese steel, i.e., Caterpillar.</p>
<p>The whole mess is quite a chuckle. Trade war? Well, in case you haven&#8217;t notice, the trade war has been waging from some time now. And, if you do not know how a command economy works, now is the time to don your reading hat, pull out your pipe, and settle down before a cozy winter fire.</p>
<p>A U.S. president has finally recognized the fact, even if many in Congress do not, i.e., those now receiving considerable financial support from American companies now profiting from that war. (Lobbies are such a tangled web.)</p>
<p>Before we jump too quickly into the fray, we should look the ways in which China subsidizes its own steel industry. The U.S. steel industry has put out an interesting <a href="http://www.sfsa.org/sfsa/news/2006/Chinese%20Steel%20Subsidies%20Paper.pdf" target="_blank">document</a> on how China subsidizes its own steel industry. Whoa, you say&#8230;obviously this document is not to be trusted.</p>
<p>Well, maybe. Some of its assertions should be scutinzed.</p>
<blockquote><p>China has the world’s largest steel industry. Indeed, in 2005, China made more steel than the next four largest producers combined. From 2000 to 2005, China’s steel production increased by over 170 percent, as the Chinese industry added capacity at a furious rate. Between 1998 and 2005, China’s steel exports more than quadrupled, as China established itself as one of the world’s leading exporters. This explosive growth in both production and exports would not have been possible without the support of the Chinese government.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now for the lessons in how a command economy works.</p>
<p>Lesson 1: A command economy actually owns many of the industries that it considers critical not only to its development but also to its control of the market place. Does that give those government own entities an edge over foreign rivals? Indeed it does. On to Lesson 2.</p>
<p>Lesson 2: Laws can be easily fashioned to give not only direct subsidies, cash and land grants, but also prefrential tax treat to all steel companies inside China. These can be in the form of export tax rebates and discounted interest rates in loans, debt to equity swaps, preferential loas&#8230;to name only a few. In short, China can write the laws governing those industries. And, wildly enough, because those laws apply to steel industriesinside China, those laws do not violate WTO principles! The question to ask now is: Can foreign steel manufacturers set up shop in China&#8211;or can they have a controlling interest in any steel making industry inside China. On to Lesson 3.</p>
<p>Lesson 3: As of 2005, China <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-07/14/content_460123.htm" target="_blank">prohibited</a>any foreign company from having a controlling stake in domestic steel companies.<br />
<blockquote>The nation will forbid foreign steel producers from taking controlling stakes in domestic steel companies, Qi Xiangdong, deputy secretary general of China Iron and Steel Association, said yesterday.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, you say, did not we do the same in the Dubai Ports flap? Steel is not quite the same as a port of entry, but if you wish to push this point, so be it. Here is the tricky part, however. China will allow foreign companies to have some interest in its domestic firms, but there is a catch. They must have independent technologies for the production of steel. &#8220;Come into my trap,&#8221; said the cat, &#8220;and bring your own cheese. Oh, you have much nicer cheese! Can we use that, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are numerous other ways in which a command economy can give advantages to its state-own firms. While the U.S. steel document enumerates many, I would like to settle on a few, so that we can see how a command economy works.</p>
<p>Lesson 4:: Export restrictions can be placed on key materials so that the cost of making a product&#8211;for example, steel&#8211;can be kept low. China has placed <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200506/24/eng20050624_192076.html" target="_blank">export restrictions</a> on coke, a critical product for the making of steel.</p>
<p>Lesson 5:Through <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-12/12/content_7299463.htm" target="_blank">export tax rebates</a>, a command economy can give significant advantage to those industries it wishes grow globally:</p>
<blockquote><p>China is considering increasing export tax rebates on certain steel products to help the industry, which is one of the worst hit by the growing international financial turmoil.<br />Minister of Industry and Information Technology Li Yizhong today told a press conference that the ministry is considering encouraging exports of high-end steel products by increasing export tax rebates. However, the ministry will continue limiting exports of high energy-intensive steel products.<br />At the same time, the government will also help steel enterprises upgrade technologies with discounted loans next year. China&#8217;s steel makers are suffering both from high prices for raw materials and from falling product prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, Virginia, there is a trade war.</p>
<p>Lesson 6: Be careful when you hear different pots call different kettles black. And I never even mentioned currency manipulation. Or energy subsidies! Think of that!</p>
