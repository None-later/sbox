                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/13273.html">Steve Benen</a>, a link to a story in the <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/article/20071017/FOREIGN/110170057/1003">Washington Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A defiant Blackwater Chairman Erik Prince said yesterday he will not allow Iraqi authorities to arrest his contractors and try them in Iraq&#8217;s faulty justice system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not let our people be taken by the Iraqis,&#8221; Mr. Prince told editors and reporters at The Washington Times. At least 17 of 20 Blackwater guards being investigated for their roles in a Sept. 16 shooting incident are still in a secure compound in Baghdad&#8217;s Green Zone and carrying out limited duties.</p>
<p>Two or three others have been allowed by the State Department to leave the country as part of their scheduled rotation out of Iraq and are expected to return.</p>
<p>&#8220;In an ideal sense, if there was wrongdoing, there could be a trial brought in the Iraqi court system. But that would imply that there is a valid Iraqi court system where Westerners could get a fair trial. That is not the case right now,&#8221; said Mr. Prince.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tell me again how Iraq is a sovereign country.  And incidentally, can Mr. Prince simply make that decision about any other country where his, um, forces operate?  If not, why not?</p>

                                <p>GW likes to talk about how he doesn&#8217;t care about polls, but he clearly cares about his legacy.  He once stated something to the effect that sometime long after we&#8217;re all dead, people will realize how good he really was.  Put another way&#8230; he&#8217;s concerned about polls, just not necessarily the ones of people who around today.</p>
<p>Now&#8230;  even if the Surge is working, Iraq can&#8217;t exactly be described as going well.  Afghanistan is a collection of autonomous fiefdoms run by warlords and fanatics where the handpicked democratically elected leader gets to call the shots in a 20 mile radius around Kabul (assume he doesn&#8217;t call those shots in ways contradicting the desire of American forces), the Taliban considers itself strong enough to ignore any and all overtures, and drug production is insanely high.  The economy has been average in his best years, and there are signs of a downturn.  And those are just the big ticket items.</p>
<p>Now, GW may not be a smart man, and he may not be an informed man, but he can&#8217;t be stupid and misinformed enough not to see this hasn&#8217;t exactly been a successful presidency so far.  Turning around one or two of these big ticket items, assuming he&#8217;s capable of doing it, won&#8217;t be enough to create a positive legacy.  His father, who had a major success (i.e., Gulf War 1) akin to one of GW&#8217;s failures, nevertheless isn&#8217;t all that well-regarded, even by Republicans. </p>
<p>Which raises the question&#8230;  what do you do when you hold by far the smallest chip stack at the table, and the blinds are going up?  (The Ex-GF loves poker tournaments &#8211; that at Starbucks seem to be here only vices &#8211; so I&#8217;m starting to pay a bit of attention to the game.)  You keep doing what you&#8217;re doing, but you look for any opportunity to make a big move &#8211; sliding your chips forward and stating &#8220;All in!&#8221;  That probably explains all the rumors we were hearing about Iran for a while.  But Iran is just a bluff &#8211; the troops aren&#8217;t there to do anything in Iran, and there&#8217;s no way in heck GW&#8217;s going all in over Iran.  And a bluff only works when the other players don&#8217;t know its a bluff.  </p>
<p>Which raises the question&#8230;  will GW have an all in?  If so, what&#8217;s it going to be?</p>

                                <p>This one is by ILSM:</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Considering the amount of money spent on militarism, I am quite annoyed by the issues raised about few billion for childrens&#8217; health care.</p>
<p>The president vetoed a bill for children while we see a billion dollars a year paid to mercenary thugs working for a republican contributor&#8217;s dream of pillaging the US.</p>
<p>One of the arguments which gets to me is the idea that: &#8216;they should not have children if they cannot keep health insurance&#8217;.</p>
<p>A significant contribution to the debate on abortion. They cannot terminate the pregnancy but when the child needs sustenance they are at fault for ever having the kids. I guess only the rich deserve to &#8220;go forth and multiply&#8221;.</p>
<p>Krugman says this is hardheartedness and ad hominem attacks which has been going on since Reagan told an interviewer in 1964 the hungry in America were dieting.</p>
<p>I rather see it as: anyone who has no health insurance is the same an an outlaw serf from the manor.</p>
<p>In Anglo Norman England in the 1200&#8217;s serfs were the wage slave, or maybe the African American slave. They were the cheap labor. Dependent on the manor and its lord for socially accepted norms of living. In effect, they were the folks with decent jobs within society. They had no safety net and they were pretty miserable, but they were &#8220;covered&#8221; in the norms of the day.</p>
<p>Those who would or could not enslave themselves to the manor went off into the forest and became outlaw. Being outlaw made you less than human, in a society which raged in Christianity. An outlaw could be killed on sight and certainly would be brought in and dealt with severely in public displays of cruel warning to others who might have a mind to differ from the norm. In many cases the road to outlawry was quite innocent, usually just demand to be treated as a human being.</p>
<p>The thing missing in the SCHIP debate is the reason for jokers like Reagan.</p>
<p>The reason conservative don&#8217;t want SCHIP expanded is because it is another assault on the modern manor system.</p>
<p>For example, consider the growing number of young soldiers who have children. A strong motive for joining the Army is the Tri Care insurance they get for their dependents.</p>
<p>If we get rid of SCHIP then there is more recruiting appeal for the Army. Or eventually a young man with kids and no insurance is the same as a medieval outlaw if he is not in the Army or sold his soul to a manor like employer who doles out benefits.</p>
<p>The rage from the conservatives is to preserve the modern manor system and not reward outlaws with SCHIP for their kids.</p>
<p>It is acceptable to make cruel jokes of the outlaws.</p>
<p>The conservatives are in favor of proper society. </p>
<p>Just do not be different.</p>

<blockquote><p>Less than half of the outpatient medical care delivered to American children is in line with recommendations for the best treatment, concludes a study released Wednesday.<br />The results, which researchers called &#8220;shocking,&#8221; show that 47% of the care delivered to children in doctors&#8217; offices and clinics meets professional recommendations or is up to date scientifically.<br />The study &#8212; conducted among 1,536 children in 12 cities &#8212; comes four years after similar research showing American adults receive recommended care 55% of the time.<br />&#8220;No one anywhere is immune to the risk of poor-quality care,&#8221; says Elizabeth A. McGlynn, PhD, a researcher at RAND Corp. who worked on the study.<br />Two-thirds of children being treated for acute illnesses received appropriate care, the researchers found after reviewing medical records.<br />But proper care for chronic conditions like asthma and diabetes was delivered just half the time, while 41% of the children received recommended preventive care, the study showed.<br />Researchers guessed that the<strong> results may actually underestimate the problem because the study participants were primarily white and from wealthier families.<br /></strong>&#8230;.</p>
<p>The researchers in part blame doctors&#8217; overly tight schedules, which often allow for 10-minute doctor visits that can crowd out needed care. They also say pediatrician residency training tends to focus on treating serious illnesses in the hospital, and not enough on prevention.<br />Joseph Hagan, MD, a co-author of soon-to-be released practice guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics, says he disagrees with some of the study&#8217;s methods. But he also calls the conclusion that children receive recommended care less than half the time &#8220;abysmal.&#8221;<br />&#8220;I see this report as a little bit of a face slap, but we know there&#8217;s been a problem and this helps us get a sense of how to go and fix it,&#8221; says Hagan, a pediatrician in private practice in Burlington, Vt.<br /><em>Hagan acknowledges that many pediatricians do not keep up to date on the latest recommendations and findings. But he also blames insurance company policies that pay doctors primarily for treating diseases and not for patient education or disease screenings.</em><br />Researchers suggest that parents not rely on doctors to remember every point of recommended screenings. Mangione-Smith urges parents to take a checklist culled from the American Academy of Pediatrics web site or other sources to the doctor&#8217;s office. (italics and bolding mine)</p>

                                <p>I normally don&#8217;t go to Megan McArdle&#8217;s site regularly, but getting attacked by someone makes you pay attention.  So I noted <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/10/i_take_it_all_back.php">this</a> on her site:</p>
<blockquote><p>A conservative publication, which I will not name, just spiked a book review because I said that the Laffer Curve didn&#8217;t apply at American levels of taxation, even while otherwise expressing my vast displeasure with the (liberal) economic notions of the book I was reviewing. This isn&#8217;t me looking for an alternative explanation for the spiking of a bad review: the literary editor accepted it, edited it, and then three hours later told me it couldn&#8217;t be published because it violated their editorial line on taxation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which of course, is their right.  The owner or editors have the right to print what they want.  Here at Angry Bear, for instance, we often put up posts by people with whom we disagree, but not all of them (and even not all the posts by people with whom we agree) go up.  We also don&#8217;t prevent people from posting comments that are personal attacks.  I believe (if memory serves this is true while I&#8217;ve been one of the writers here, and I believe this policy predates my joining) the only comments that have ever been deleted from this site have been pornographic ads put up by spambots, plus, one time, comments by a spoofer were removed.  However, if you read the comments, you know PGL and I and the rest of the Angry Bears are often treated as fair game.  </p>
<p>Which gets me to this&#8230;  This morning, Ms. McArdle had a post that said <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/10/the_budget_deficit_falls_again.php#comments">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks to George Bush&#8217;s amazing deficit reduction plan, the budget deficit is now only 1.2% of GDP. If this trend continues, by the time George Bush leaves office, the budget will be within a hair&#8217;s breath of being balanced. I can only hope that Democrats don&#8217;t squander this precious legacy of fiscal responsibility.</p>
<p>Just kidding! Not about the budget deficit, I mean, but about the reason for it. The reason the budget deficit has closed is a combination of economic growth and increasing inequality, which has allowed the government to collect more revenue on a smaller base. The rich really are different&#8211;they pay higher tax rates.</p>
<p>These are the perils of attributing economic activity to presidential will. Democrats who got angry when they read the first paragraph should note that the budget deficit is closing whether or not George Bush wants it to; broad trends in the economy dominate even large changes in tax rates. Likewise, the fact that Bill Clinton wanted to close the budget deficit doesn&#8217;t mean he did; in fact, broad changes in the economy were a much more important driver of change. </p></blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis added by me.)</p>
<p>Anyway, at the risk of acting like its all about me, I imagine based on our recent exchange that the part I highlighted was at least in part, directed at me.  After all, Megan McArdle&#8217;s criticism of my series on the Presidents is precisely what she wrote in that sentence I emphasized.</p>
<p>So&#8230;  I wrote a response in the comments section.  When I clicked on publish, a message came up indicating that my comment was being held pending the OK of the site owner (or something along those lines).  It hasn&#8217;t come up, and there have been literally tens of comments posted since.  Anyway &#8211; her site &#8211; or the Atlantic&#8217;s, they have the right to whatever policy they want.   I imagine that I&#8217;ve been flagged as some sort of agent provocateur and comments that come from my computer or address require approval.  (I haven&#8217;t experimented, nor am I interested enough.  I&#8217;m probably about done going to Megan McArdle&#8217;s site for a while.) </p>
<p>Anyway, I wish I had saved my response &#8211; if I had, I&#8217;d post it below.  I think it would have made a pretty good stand-alone post.  I made some points about how the Presidential will is irrelevant&#8230; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">this was the Presidential will on February 28, 2001</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, the President&#8217;s Budget pays down the debt so aggressively that it runs into an unusual problem—its annual surpluses begin to outstrip the amount of maturing debt starting in 2007. This means that the United States will be effectively unable to retire any more debt than what is assumed in the Administration&#8217;s Budget over the next 10 years—the President achieves &#8220;maximum possible debt retirement&#8221; in his budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>What matters is the Presidential actions, and how much work, effort, thought and logic went into those actions.  And with some Presidents&#8230; folks who spend their time on vacation, their non-vacation time mountain biking, and who generally talk about how useless the government is&#8230; one shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they produce mediocre results and are left with nothing to brag about except that they managed to alleviate some of the problems they themselves created.  I also noted that given Megan McArdle&#8217;s libertarian philosophy, it would be hard for her to accept that the mere fact that this President is someone who puts in little time or effort into the job and doesn&#8217;t think much of the government is enough to conclude that the economy will probably underperform during his tenure.   </p>
<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t remember everything I wrote.  But there was nothing offensive or rude or crude in what I wrote.  Certainly, if there was anything disparaging in it, it was less so then her language toward me in her posts last week.  </p>
<p>But in the end, its not important.  Here&#8217;s what I think is important.  Megan McArdle won&#8217;t name the publication that turned down her piece.  Perhaps she thinks they were in the wrong &#8211; or at least their reasons for turning down the piece weren&#8217;t the best.  But she won&#8217;t name them because she hopes to do business with them again.  She hopes to write more pieces for them.  She moves in circles with people who brook no deviation form a party line, and clearly wants to remain in those circles.</p>
<p>I also disagree with the, um, rejection of my little piece.  And I don&#8217;t think the reason for turning it down was such a good one.  But as you can see from this post, I&#8217;m perfectly happy to name the editor/publisher I believe turned me down.        And while I&#8217;m nobody special &#8211; just one of the writers in a highly specialized amateur blog that has a fraction of the readers that Megan McArdle&#8217;s blog no doubt has, I don&#8217;t have much of an interest in associating myself with that person going forward.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Megan McArdle responds in comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cactus, I have no idea where your post went, but it&#8217;s not anywhere in our system. In fact, I haven&#8217;t checked the junk mail filter all day, but I just went through it with a fine tooth comb, and there&#8217;s nothing in it by you. If you want to resubmit, please do, and if it fails again, send it to me and I&#8217;ll post it.</p>
<p>I censor very, very, lightly, and when I do, it&#8217;s for profanity, commercial links, or attempts to start flame wars. And when I do&#8211;again, unless it&#8217;s spam&#8211;I always leave a note, precisely to avoid the temptation to disappear critics in the way that some notable blogs do. We may disagree, but I&#8217;d never ding your comments. If you have trouble with the spam filter&#8211;which I don&#8217;t control, other than to fish stuff out&#8211;just let me know so I can approve you. We&#8217;ve had four hundred spams today, so unfortunately, it&#8217;s a necessary evil.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m going to chalk this one up to a misunderstanding and assume I stand corrected.  Given that assumption, I apologize for jumping to conclusions.</p>

<p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/10/personal-taxes-as-percent-of-gdp.html">Greg Mankiw</a> should be congratulated as he provides a graph of personal current taxes that includes what we pay at the state and local level relative to GDP.  It does not include deferred taxes but no one knows how these will be paid as George W. Bush just scoffs at this reality.  It also does not include payroll taxes but that’s OK as long as we are not <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/social-security-trust-fund-deniers.html">denying the Trust Fund reserves</a>.</p>
<p>But I do have a complaint. It leaves the impression that we are paying a lot more now they we have ever paid except during the Clinton years.  To be fair – Greg did not say that even if one AB reader seemed to suggest commentary that Greg never made.  But we should notice that Greg left off what I’d call business taxes.  Since Greg was kind enough to cite his source – line 3 from table 3.1 found <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">here</a> &#8211; I’m defining business taxes to be the sums of lines 3 and 4.  I’ve also graphed line 2 from the same table as total current tax receipts.  Total taxes as a share of GDP are not higher than they’ve ever been.  You see – we may be paying more in personal taxes but business taxes as a share of GDP have declined from their levels before 1981.</p>

                                <p>Over at <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2007/10/social-security-us-treasury-declares.html">EconoSpeak</a>, I went off on one of my pet peeves.  You see – I took President Reagan at his word back in 1983 when he said that higher payroll tax that I’ve paid for almost a quarter of a century was designed to insure I would get my promised Social Security benefit, which is why I continue to separately report the Trust Fund surpluses and the General Fund deficits.  Just like there are Global Warming Deniers, there are Trust Fund Deniers.</p>
<p>So when anyone tout the alleged deficit progress by citing the unified deficit, it is time to chalk them up as a Trust Fund Denier.  A prime example is <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/10/update-on-federal-budget.html">Greg Mankiw</a> who declares the current unified deficit to be not so bad with the real problems is that folks like me will soon be expecting Social Security retirement benefits to actually be paid.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Bushies have used rising tax receipts since 2004 as supposed proof that tax cuts pay for themselves — carefully ignoring the fact that revenues plunged in the early years of the administration, and that the subsequent rapid growth basically just gets us back to the previous trend. Also, they’ve pretended not to notice that mainly the revenue comes from an incredible surge in corporate profits, the byproduct of an economy in which economic growth leaves most workers behind.</p>
<p>But anyway, the revenue surge is over. </p></blockquote>
<p>In an <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/16/failing-to-pass-the-laffer-test/">update</a>, Krugman provides this graph of tax revenue as a percentage of GDP since Clinton took office:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RxYHwrL0VzI/AAAAAAAAAzA/32Qz4eVDe6E/s1600-h/krugtax.gif"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RxYHwrL0VzI/AAAAAAAAAzA/32Qz4eVDe6E/s320/krugtax.gif" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>And a further slowdown is visible within the fiscal 2007 data: revenue in September was up only 2 percent from the previous year. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/10/fun_with_the_laffer_curve.php">Matthew Yglesias</a>, a link to <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/64603">an editorial in the NY Sun</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reductions in top marginal tax rates provide incentives for growth and lead to greater government revenues in the long run. That is not always the case. There is a point on the Laffer Curve at which tax cuts on the top margin stop generating increased income, but we are nowhere near that point now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, via Yglesias, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjI3OTQ5ZWJkNWI3YTIwMWRjN2Y4Zjk2N2YyZGFkYzU=">Ramesh Ponnuru</a> at the Corner:</p>
<blockquote><p>Presumably what they mean is that the top income tax rate is higher than the revenue-maximizing rate, but I&#8217;m not sure why they think that it is. Bush&#8217;s tax cuts appear to have caused revenue to be lower than it would otherwise have been, which suggests that we&#8217;re already below the revenue-maximizing tax rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yglesias thinks this is Ponnuru unleashing dry wit.  Maybe I&#8217;m misreading things, but to me this is a sign that the National Review gives great severance packages and Ponnuru is trying to get his hands on one.  Or more likely he didn&#8217;t realize what he was writing, but this was way too sane and data-compatible for the National Review if you ask me.  Because the implication is&#8230;   perhaps its time to raise tax rates, which may raise growth rates and will also, not incidentally, raise tax revenues.</p>
<p>Update&#8230;  corrected last sentence.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Arctic ice cap shrank so much this summer that waves briefly lapped along two long-imagined Arctic shipping routes, the Northwest Passage over Canada and the Northern Sea Route over Russia.</p>

<p>McKenzie Funk<br />Arctic Study Researchers haul a buoy across the Arctic sea ice in August, led by two Coast Guard crew whose job was to ward off polar bears or rescue anyone who slipped into the sea. <a name="secondParagraph"></a><br />Over all, the floating ice dwindled to an extent unparalleled in a century or more, by several estimates.<br />Now the six-month dark season has returned to the North Pole. In the deepening chill, new ice is already spreading over vast stretches of the Arctic Ocean. Astonished by the summer’s changes, scientists are studying the forces that exposed one million square miles of open water — six Californias — beyond the average since satellites started measurements in 1979.<br />At a recent gathering of sea-ice experts at the <a title="http://www.uaf.edu/" href="http://www.uaf.edu/">University of Alaska</a> in Fairbanks, <a title="http://www.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/sea-lake-ice/eicken.html" href="http://www.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/sea-lake-ice/eicken.html">Hajo Eicken</a>, a geophysicist, summarized it this way: “Our stock in trade seems to be going away.”<br />Scientists are also unnerved by the summer’s implications for the future, and their ability to predict it.</p>
<p>Complicating the picture, the striking Arctic change was as much a result of ice moving as melting, many say. A new study, led by Son Nghiem at <a title="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_aeronautics_and_space_administration/index.html?inline=" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_aeronautics_and_space_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org">NASA</a>’s<a title="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/"> </a><a title="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/j/jet_propulsion_laboratory/index.html?inline=" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/j/jet_propulsion_laboratory/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> and appearing this week in Geophysical Research Letters, used satellites and buoys to show that winds since 2000 had pushed huge amounts of thick old ice out of the Arctic basin past Greenland. The thin floes that formed on the resulting open water melted quicker or could be shuffled together by winds and similarly expelled, the authors said.<br />The pace of change has far exceeded what had been estimated by almost all the simulations used to envision how the Arctic will respond to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases linked to <a title="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">global warming</a>. But that disconnect can cut two ways. Are the models overly conservative? Or are they missing natural influences that can cause wide swings in ice and temperature, thereby dwarfing the slow background warming?<br />The world is paying more attention than ever.<br />Russia, Canada and Denmark, prompted in part by years of warming and the ice retreat this year, ratcheted up rhetoric and actions aimed at securing sea routes and seabed resources.</p>

<p>Reports on Great Lakes thinning or lack of winter ice due to increasing water temperatures being responsible for greater evaporation comes to mind as well. Real impacts if continuing, although yearly fluctuations occur for any one lack. Superior has regained a few centimeters, but other are lowering levels.</p>

<blockquote><p>The western Antarctic Peninsula has showed the biggest increase in temperatures observed anywhere on Earth over the past half-century.<br />Stronger westerly winds are forcing warm air eastward and over the natural barrier created by the Antarctic Peninsula&#8217;s 1.25 mile-high mountain chain.<br />During the past 40 years the average summer temperatures in this region of the north-east peninsula has been 2.2 degrees Celsius, but on days when warm winds top the mountains of the peninsula, temperatures rise by 5 to 10 degrees Celsius, the researchers said.</p></blockquote>
