<p>So the Democrats and Republicans on the so-called &#8220;Super-Committee&#8221; that is supposed to find $1.2 trillion in budget reductions/increased revenues within a week now thinks it has a solution&#8211;let the regular tax committees (Finance and Ways &#038; Means) come up with the tax revenues, while the Super-Committee will go on and specify the spending cuts.  See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/us/politics/panel-seeks-way-to-reach-a-deal-on-tax-increase.html">Deficit Panel Seeks to Defer Details on Raising Taxes</a>, New York Times (Nov. 14, 2011).</p>
<p>The proposal doesn&#8217;t sound like anything that the Dems on the panel should accept.  For a piddling reduction in some of the deductions available to the most affluent individuals, the GOP is willing to lower the rate on those individuals to 28%!  Just more enriching the rich.  The Dems shouldn&#8217;t agree to that.  Especially since Grover Norquist thinks that any such agreement would be undone immediately, while any stupid agreement the Dems make to &#8220;reforming&#8221; (i.e., cutting benefits from) the earned benefits programs will be allowed to take place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grover G. Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, whose antitax pledge has been signed by most Republicans in Congress, said in an interview, “I am not losing any sleep” over the Republicans’ latest proposal. Mr. Norquist said he was confident that, “at the end of the day, the Republican House will not pass a tax increase.”</p>
<p>“As a face-saving measure,” Mr. Norquist said, the deficit reduction panel “could give lots of instructions to the tax-writing committees.” In complying with those instructions, he said, the House and the Senate could pass very different bills.  Id.</p>

<p>It is hard to see why any cuts to the earned benefits programs should be made. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are more important now than ever because of the weak economy.  We are a rich country and we can afford these programs.Tax 100% of compensation for Social Security.   And treat all profits interests as compensation income when allocations are received, so that partnerships treat persons as partners only when they have a capital investment in the partnership business.</p>
<p>Let the military be cut at least $750 billion.  And raise the rest through taxes&#8211;especially through a progressive estate tax and through eliminating the character preference for capital gains income. </p>
<p>This country is tired of being held hostage by far-right radicals  who don&#8217;t understand that the government acts for the people and who don&#8217;t give a damn for anybody that isn&#8217;t in the top 20% of the income and wealth distribution.  We are tired of the radical right&#8217;s anarchistic actions to prevent the government from borrowing money to carry out important programs.  We are tired of the radical right&#8217;s stupidity about the economy and its reliance on ideological beliefs in &#8220;trickle down&#8221; programs to justify tax cuts no matter what situation the country is in.  We are tired of the radical right&#8217;s refusal to acknowledge the facts about the failures of the four-decade experiment with reaganomics, during which time the large multinational corporations have been allowed to function like quasi-sovereigns.  We are tired of seeing tax policies that support consolidation of corporate empires and movement of business overseas, while Americans lose jobs and watch their wages decline.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Contentv2.pdf">From the report</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Procurement funding grew from $62.6B in FY01 to as much as $135.8B throughout the decade.3 In constant dollars, base procurement funding in FY10 increased by 41 percent from FY01.4 Increases also were augmented by the use of supplemental war funding. In FY02, only $1.4B was appropriated for procurement in supplemental war funding. That increased every year until $65.9B was appropriated in FY08. FY08 ended up as the high water mark, but the following three years have all seen procurement funding of about $30B included in war funding.5 In all, $232.8B or 22 percent of total procurement funding in the last decade came from supplemental war funding. Although procurement funding increased in the base budget, supplemental war funding significantly enhanced the resources available.</p>

<p>The Mother Jones article<br />
<blockquote>
<p>says the military is hardly in dire straits when it comes to funding its big-ticket items. &#8220;The services capitalized on funding to modernize their forces, especially the major weapons programs that constitute the heart of the services&#8217; capabilities,&#8221; writes the report&#8217;s author, Russell Rumbaugh—a retired Army officer and ex-CIA military analyst.</p>
<p>The study shows there&#8217;s one big reason the brass are concerned about budget-cutting discussions in Congress: They&#8217;ve been double dipping into the taxpayer&#8217;s pocket to finance weapons purchases. Of the roughly $1 trillion spent on gadgetry since 9/11, 22 percent of it came from &#8220;supplemental&#8221; war funding—annual outlays that are voted on separately from the regular defense budget. Those bills are primarily intended to keep day-to-day operations running in Iraq and Afghanistan—meaning that if a member of Congress votes against a supplemental spending bill, she exposes herself to charges that she doesn&#8217;t &#8220;support the troops&#8221; in harm&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s plenty to cut, thanks to McKeon and his congressional cohort. This spring, they <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/06/congress-defense-budget-stealth-earmarks">preserved defense earmarks</a> after vowing that they wouldn&#8217;t; voted to <a href="http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/03/gop-house-panel-halts-gear-troops">make more Humvees the Army doesn&#8217;t want</a> (and reject Afghanistan base defense systems that it did); to keep <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/04/military-ge-f136-jsf-engine">an unnecessary $3 billion GE contract</a> to build an &#8220;alternative engine&#8221; for the single-engine Joint Strike Fighter, whose costs are approaching $1 trillion; and <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/06/eight-weirdest-defense-budget-amendments">to repatriate US victims</a> of the 1804 Barbary War in Libya.</p>
<p>In their defense, they did vote to trim defense dollars by <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/04/gop-plan-cut-defense-no-color-copies-west">banning color copies</a> at the Pentagon.</p>

                                <p>Rumors suggest that Italy is so desperate for money that it will try the full Monti*. </p>
<p>Mario Monti is about to be asked to try to form a government.  Of course the actual negotiations have begun, except it doesn&#8217;t seem that Prof.  Monti is inclined to negotiate.  His position seems to be that Italian politicians totally blew it (correct) so they will let him try to fix things (good luck with that).</p>
<p>The rumored position of the Berlusconi has moved from the prime minister should be one of his guys, to he should name half of the cabinet to he should name at least someone (who would be Gianni Letta his Rove) to OK just don&#8217;t take away my TV (spoiled kids are that way).</p>
<p>Monti has already <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2011/11/13/news/totoministri_milella-24929436/?ref=HREA-1">semi-officially announced that the new economics minister with be Guido Tabellini who is widely considered to be the most eminent Italian economist in Italy**. He is known for his work on how politicians do not serve the public interest (kids this was an original approach when he started &#8212; really).</p>
<p>The justice minister is likely to be a judge***. </a> Monti is alleged to have specifically refused to negotiate with Berlusconi about any reforms to the Justice system (which has been repeatedly reformed in ways which keep Berlusconi out of jail).</p>
<p>The bit about TV is, sadly, not a joke.  Monti is rumored to have agreed that he won&#8217;t change the regulation of TV.  He also is rumored to have agreed not to change the horrible electoral law.  I am summarizing Italian newspapers which report rumors.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how it will turn out, but it seems to be a rather radical shift. The logic seems to be that members of parliament who know they will never be re-elected will do anything to avoid early elections (their salary is actually fairly high by Italian standards and Berlusconi supporters come cheap).</p>
<p>Both Monti and Tabellini are definitely right of center.  The aim seems to be to reassure investors.  </p>

<p>*Yes I wrote the post for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bDDsZLYK1s&#038;feature=related">the joke in the title</a>.  Have a problem with that ?</p>
<p>** There are many eminent Italian born economists who have escaped all over the world.  Also there are eminent English economists and one Canadian economist who live in Italy.  Finally I am reporting the general view and not making any personal evaluation.</p>
<p>*** the one sour note is  &#8220;La quarta alternativa è quella di Carlo Nordio, magistrato inquirente a Venezia,&#8221; that is &#8220;the fourth alternative (for justice minister) is Carlo Nordio an investigating magistrate in Venice.&#8221; Nordio is a total hack.  There is an interception of one of Craxi&#8217;s lawyers noting that he and Nordio (then as now a magistrate) were working together.  Then he investigated cooperatives vaguely related to the Italian Communist Party over scandals which make Solyndra look scandalous (including was the tombola (bingo) money in a communist club kept separate from party money &#8212; really).  If Nordio is justice minister than Berlusconi will have achieved his final aim of having one of his guys in the cabinet and continuing to use politicians to obstruct justice.</p>

<p>GOP wants to repeal Dodd-Frank: instead they should listen to Nassim Taleb
<p>Nassim Taleb, the author of the book on long-tail events, suggests in a Nov. 6, 2011 op-ed in the New York Times that &#8220;it is only a matter of time before private risktaking leads to another giant bailout like the ones the United States was forced to provide in 2008.&#8221; </p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty strong language, and should be cause for worry among those GOP debaters who have been in a pissing contest over how much legislation they can suggest for repeal, like Dodd-Frank, health care reform, and environmental protection.  Instead of defending big banks, the GOP should start thinking about how to break them up.  Instead of suggesting that we need to repeal Dodd-Frank and end regulation of banks, Taleb says we do need  regulation but can&#8217;t depend on it alone: &#8220;Supervision, regulation, and other forms of monitoring are necessary, but insufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>And instead of defending risk-taking bankers as innovators and entrepreneurs, Congress should be considering measures to undo the incentives for risk taking.  Taleb says&#8211;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/opinion/end-bonuses-for-bankers.html">End Bonuses for Bankers</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]t&#8217;s time for a fundamental reform:  Any person who works for a company that, regardless of its current financial health, would require a taxpayer-financed bailout if it failed, should not get a bonus, ever.  In fact, all pay at systemically important financial institutions&#8211;big banks, but also some insurance companies and even huge hedge funds&#8211;should be strictly regulated.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bonuses are particularly dangerous because they invite bankers to game the system by hiding the risks of rare and hard-to-predict but consequential blow-ups, which I have called &#8216;black swan&#8217; events. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like sound advice.  Bonuses encourage risktaking, and risktaking encourages breakdowns of TBTF banks.  Breakdowns lead to taxpayer bailouts.  To break the chain, deny the bonuses.</p>
<blockquote><p>The asymmetric nature of the bonus (an incentive for success without a corresponding disincentive for failure) causes hidden risks to accmumlate in the financial system and become a catalyst for disaster.  This violates the fundamental rules of capitalism:  Adam Smith himself was wary of the effect of limiting liability, a bedrock principle of the modern corporation.</p>

<p>Here Taleb touches on a factor in the expanding risk of our economy&#8211;and the expanding immunity of the manager class from the risk they cause.  Corporations provide limited liability to their owners.  And innovations over the last few decades have expanded limited liability to almost all investors even in pass-through entities that pay no entity-level tax, through the limited liability company and the limited liability partnerships. That is one of the reasons I have argued for Congress to enact legislation to restrain the availability of tax-free mergers and reorganizations.  The combination of easily attained limited liability plus easily attained consolidation of entities has been a factor in the growth of the corporatist state.</p>
<p>Taleb has a good point about the incidence of bonuses in the US market system as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>We trust military and homeland secrutiy personnel with our lives, yet we don&#8217;t give them lavish bonuses.  They get promotions and the honor of a job well done if they succeed, and the severe disincentive of shame if they fail.  For bankers, it is the opposite: a bonus if they make short-term profits and a bailout if they go bust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Eliminating bonuses would make banking boring again, like it was before the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.  Boring, in this case, is good.  Congress should consider what kind of legislation could be designed to make bonuses in banking less likely, through tax disincentives or other means.</p>

<p>SOCIAL SECURITY AIN&#8217;T BROKE</p>
<p>A Reply to Linda Beale</p>
<p>I want to take advantage of Linda Beale&#8217;s essay &#8220;Social Security: It Ain&#8217;t Broke Unless China is too&#8221; to make some points of my own.  I want to be clear at the outset that I am grateful to Linda for her essay.  She is essentially right.  My comments are secondary.  It&#8217;s not a case of my disagreeing with Linda, but of having something to say that I hope will help people understand the Social Security &#8220;question&#8221; a little better.  </p>
<p>I am going to assume the reader has Linda&#8217;s essay in front of him.</p>
<p>First, I don&#8217;t agree with Krugman: you CANNOT think of Social Security as &#8220;part of the budget.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t know how the government talks to itself about this,  but they sure went to a lot of effort to segregate Social Security funds from the budget with a payroll tax and a Trust Fund. . You don&#8217;t have a &#8220;trust fund&#8221; if the money is fungible.</p>
<p>We once had a reader at Angry Bear point to a CBO &#8220;paper&#8221; that said because SS funds come into the Treasury like other taxes, they cannot be regarded as separate from those other taxes. The money is not &#8220;marked&#8221; so you can tell SS money from other money.  This is a lie.  The government is quite capable of keeping track of where the money comes from and where it is dedicated by law to go.  So be warned, there are experts, even in the heart of CBO who are quite willing to lie to you if they think they can get away with it.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Second,  i don&#8217;t like the usage  &#8220;workers pay&#8230; to support [past workers, current retirees] who paid into it in the past.&#8221;   While this is technically true,  it is misleading.  Those current retirees DID pay into SS in the past.  They paid for their own benefits.  Pay as you go is merely the very clever way the first cohort&#8217;s payments are protected from inflation, and earn interest, without being exposed to the risks of the market, so they can be returned to the taxpayer in time to help pay for his retirement.  It is critical that people understand that the workers pay for their own benefits.  It is NOT &#8220;the young paying for the old.&#8221;   When they figure your benefits, they look at what YOU paid in, not what your son is paying in.</p>
<p>Like a lot of things in life, both ideas are true here.  We are paying for the older generation, just as the next generation will pay for us. But at the same time we are paying directly for ourself.  The money we pay is recorded against our name.  Just like in a bank account.</p>
<p>Third , you&#8217;ll get some disagreement  about when the Trust Fund was created and what for.  Beale is essentially right about the present Trust Fund being created to allow the boomers to pay in advance for the part of their own retirement benefits that would be needed in excess of normal pay as you go. The trust fund was there at the beginning as a simple way to buffer income against outgo, both for normal monthly ebbs and flows, and for the occasional recession when taxes collected would fall short of benefits &#8220;promised.&#8221;  But the &#8217;83 Social Security Commission knew the boomer retirement was coming, and the tax rate they set at that time &#8220;just happened&#8221; to result in a Trust Fund large enough to bridge the boomer retirement. This is the point we have reached today.  A long expected point, in spite of the liars screaming that SS has gone &#8220;cash flow negative.&#8221;  SS has not gone &#8220;negative.&#8221;  It&#8217;s cash flow includes interest, and eventually principle, from the savings it generated exactly for this purpose.</p>
<p>Fourth, I don&#8217;t agree with Beale that there is NO &#8220;problem.&#8221;  The Trust Fund is not the problem.  The problem is that as people live longer, they will need to devote a higher percent of their earnings to their retirement.. OR not retire as young, OR live on less when they do.  I don&#8217;t think any sane person would choose options 2 and 3 when option 1 is so cheap.  But it IS a &#8220;problem,&#8221;  a very small one once it is understood, which is why the bad guys work so very hard to prevent your understanding it.  You, the young, can insure your own future retirement  with no increase in retirement age or cut in monthly benefits simply by raising your own tax&#8230; really your own savings rate&#8230; one half of one tenth of one percent per year,  or about forty cents per week in today&#8217;s terms.  This is an enormously better solution than not letting people retire when they are old, or cutting their benefits below survival levels, or taxing the rich and turning Social Security into welfare as we knew it.</p>
<p>Fifth.. the Trust Fund treasuries will indeed run out some time around 2030 or 40 or 50.  It is a fatal argument to tell people don&#8217;t worry be happy.  Even &#8220;the young&#8221; can see that they will be taking a benefit cut when they retire if nothing is done.  Their problem is they don&#8217;t know they can avoid the benefit cut by raising their own &#8220;tax&#8221; by an amount so small they would not even notice it.  </p>
<p>Default or not Default is not the question.  Default would just move up the day when the tax needs to be raised, but would make no real difference in justice to anyone.  And the lying bastards won&#8217;t default in a way you could bring them to court for.  They will just cut benefits one way or another so the TF does not have to be paid back in a time inconvenient to themselves.  They CAN do that.  And that is the extent to which Uncle Sam borrowing from himself IS a problem.  But it is not the problem that the liars say it is.  Uncle Sam will have no problem finding the money. In fact, i don&#8217;t think the liars really care about the money. What they really want to do is destroy Social Security. They hate it because they hate the idea of &#8220;the help&#8221; being idle.  They can&#8217;t imagine you might think you have something more important to do with your golden years than work for them.</p>
<p>Sixth..  The liars claim that the iou&#8217;s are meaningless is based on their idea that the government has to tax the people to find the money to pay the people.  This is a confusion &#8230; we are not all the same person&#8230;  but it is one they probably sincerely believe, and it isn&#8217;t helpful (to them) for us to miss the point. It needs to be explained. The money is owed to the people who paid their payroll tax on the understanding that it would be used to pay for their retirement.  It will be paid by people who did not pay that payroll tax, and who presumably benefitted by borrowing the money.  They will not be paying twice for their Social Security.  They will be paying for the first time for what their government bought with the money they borrowed FROM Social Security.  The rich know that it is THEY who will be taxed to pay back the money they borrowed from Social Security.  And they are just short sighted enough to stop thinking right there, especially as they can rationalize that the money was borrowed not by them but by &#8220;the government&#8221;  whoever that is. But since they hate the government, they can pretend they have no obligation to pay it&#8217;s bills just by pretending they got no benefit from spending the money.</p>
<p>Again, I want to think Linda for her essay, and I hope this helps.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve noted in these postings the growing inequality between rich and the rest of us in America, and that is the appropriate backdrop against which to investigate further the right&#8217;s smoke-and-mirrors scams about tax policy and earned benefits.  Let me remind you with Kevin Drum&#8217;s Mother Jones article on <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/10/price-plutocracy-0">The Price of Plutocracy</a>: &#8220;<strong><em>For all practical purposes, every year about $700 billion in income is being sucked directly out of the hands of the poor and the middle class and shoveled into the hands of the rich</em>.</strong>&#8221; (That sentence is illustrated with a great chart, with data drawn from Joseph Hacker of Yale and Paul Pierson of Berkeley, the authors of Winner-Take-All Politics, a book I highly recommend.)</p>
<p>The national debate about deficits has been part of a relentless push by the right to reduce as much as possible the New Deal earned benefit programs of Social Security and Medicare. The right twists the facts to suit the arguments it wants to make.  Krugman hones in on this issue, noting Dean Baker&#8217;s similar anger at the Washington Post&#8217;s inconsistency in considering Social Security in a recent article by Post writer Lori Montgomery, who seems to be miming for the hard right, anti-New Deal crowd in Washington .  See Krugman, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/social-security-bait-and-switch-a-continuing-series/">Social Security, Bait and Switch, a Continuing Series</a>, New York Times (Oct. 30, 2011).</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Social Security is a program that is part of the federal budget, but is by law supported by a dedicated source of revenue. This means that there are two ways to look at the program’s finances: in legal terms, or as part of the broader budget picture.</em></p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p><em>In legal terms, the program is funded not just by today’s payroll taxes, but by accumulated past surpluses — the trust fund. If there’s a year when payroll receipts fall short of benefits, but there are still trillions of dollars in the trust fund, what happens is, precisely, nothing — the program has the funds it needs to operate, without need for any Congressional action.</em></p>
<p><em>Alternatively, you can think about Social Security as just part of the federal budget. But in that case, it’s just part of the federal budget; it doesn’t have either surpluses or deficits, no more than the defense budget.</em></p>
<p><em>Both views are valid, depending on what questions you’re trying to answer.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What you can’t do is insist that the trust fund is meaningless, because SS is just part of the budget, then claim that some crisis arises when receipts fall short of payments, because SS is a standalone program</em>.</strong>  Id. (emphasis added).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, the right refers to these programs as &#8220;entitlements&#8221;, a term that is meant to dredge up resentments against those who have some rights to benefits from these programs.  The right uses &#8220;personal responsibility&#8221; and &#8220;entitlements&#8221; as though they refer to two non-intersecting worlds, whereas in fact the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Workers pay into Social Security to support current workers who paid into it in the past.  The trust fund was established, and amended with a good deal of actuarial research under Reagan in 1983, with the knowledge that the baby boom generation would be passing through and create a bulge of benefit needs and that US birth rates tended to be smaller now than they were a century ago.  In other words.  what is happening now in terms of the baby boomer population reaching retirement age and the decline in US birthrates was exactly the information on which the Social Security changes made in the 1980s were predicated.  Either we believe that these kinds of predictions are reasonable (in which case it is utterly silly to raise nightmare scenarioes about bankruptcy, because there is nothing of the sort) or we believe that it is impossible to predict for sure what will happen (in which case it is utterly silly to raise nightmare scenarios about Social Security bankruptcy, because GDP could grow just a little faster than predicted, easing all future problems, or boomer needs could grow just a little less than predicted, easing all future problems).  Either way, the crisis-bell ringing being done by the right as a way to attribute deficits to Social Security is a smoke and mirrors scam.</p>
<p>It is even more so since the Social Security trust fund is invested in US Treasuries and those Treasuries plus new tax funds coming in pay all the benefit costs.  Is the US going to default on Treasuries.  Well, if so, we have a bigger problem with Japan and China not liking that&#8211;not just the Social Security trust fund.  The hard right seems to think it is okay to play political games with US debt, but American citizens should be aware that this is what they are doing.</p>
<p>For a good overall exposition of these issues, see the article in  Salon by Gene Lyons, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/11/03/how_the_rich_created_the_social_security_crisis/?source=newsletter">How the Rich Created the Social Security &#8216;Crisis&#8217;</a> (Nov. 3, 2011) (noting the &#8220;decades-long propaganda war against America’s most efficient, successful and popular social insurance program&#8221;).</p>
<blockquote><p><em>[T]his is the beneficiaries’ money, invested by the Social Security trustees in U.S. Treasury bonds drawn upon “the full faith and credit of the United States.” <strong>Far from being “meaningless IOUs” as right-wing cant has it, they represent the same legally binding promise between the U.S. government and its people that it makes with Wall Street banks and the Chinese government, which also hold Treasury Bonds</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>A promise not very different, the Daily Howler’s Bob Somerby points out, from the one implicit in your bank statement or 401K (if you’re lucky enough to have one). Did you think the money was buried in earthen jars filled with gold bullion and precious stones?  Id. (emphasis added).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One might add that many of our multinational corporations that are currently lobbying heavily for yet another tax break in the form of a &#8220;repatriation holiday&#8221; for their offshored, untaxed profits actually have the substantial portion of those profits invested in those same U.S. Treasury notes.  So, as ataxingmatter has noted before, much of that money is already in the US and repatriation will generally not be of much benefit merely from bringing cash back to go through the US economy.  As the article notes, allowing repatriation would lead to corporations dumping about a trillion of US Treasuries on the market, and likely cause a rise in the interest rate the US government must pay to borrow.  Not a win-win situation.  IN fact, clearly a loss for the US government and the majority of US taxpayers, both in Treasury interest rates and in lost corporate tax revenues.</p>

                                <p>On this <s><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/11/november-11-2010-was-the-last-armistice-day">Armistice</a></s> Veteran&#8217;s Day, let&#8217;s try to do a counterfactual and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/11/wanted-a-sympathetic-account-of-geithnerism.html">Make Brad DeLong Happy</a>.*</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm%E2%80%93Leach%E2%80%93Bliley_Act">Gramm-Leach-Bliley</a>—commonly referred to, incorrectly, as &#8220;the repeal of Glass_Steagall&#8221;—is A Good Thing. Well, I won&#8217;t go that far. An Inevitable Thing. [Many sentences about Larry Summers omitted here.] After all, anyone who was paying attention knew that Glass-Steagall had already been shivved several times by 1999, and that letting <s>Citi buy Travelers</s> banks buy insurance companies (and vice versa) was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>(If you tell me that&#8217;s a good thing, I&#8217;m going to point out that the risks of banks and the risks of insurance companies are the same, that combining them in no way makes the financial system safer or improves risk management, and that, therefore, you&#8217;re an idiot. But pointing something so fundamental out to a Summers or a Bob Rubin would be like telling your two-year-old not to pull the cat&#8217;s tail; the only question is who ends up getting stitches.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies are essentially fungible entities. What will we see?:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commercial banks will be able to outcompete investment banks, due to Gresham&#8217;s Law. They have more money, and can afford to make mistakes.</li>
<li>As a result of this, investment banks, with less capital and therefore less room for mistakes, will become more likely to fail as independent entities. (You would have to be stupid, or <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2008/09/hindsight-regulation/4122/">McMegan</a>, to assume the brunt of the damage would go the other way.) <br />Results: 
<ol>
<li>Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which occurred two years earlier, will serve as a warning sign that will be ignored by the banks, which &#8220;know&#8221; that the acquisition was backwards</li>
<li>J.P. Morgan will be acquired by <s>Manny Hanny</s>Chase,</li>
<li>Goldman Sachs has to go public to acquire capital; Jon Corzine is forced out because he realizes (having seen Bear and Merrill and Morgan Stanley do it before) that it will fundamentally destroy the incentive structure and culture of the firm.</li>
<li>Investors working on the Greater Fool Theory will decide that Investment Banks might win the battle, and will bid up the BSCs and LEHs of the world, figuring that either (a) they will be acquired (JPM) or (b) they will grow on their own (GS, MS). This will be temporarily self-fulfilling, <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/03/charts-of-the-d.html">until it isn&#8217;t</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p></li>
<li>Insurance companies will move more into banking services (as their subsidiaries have for years) in search of more cash to search for more yield and more long-term investments and short-term arbitrage. Since they do much of this now, the only additional risk will be if there is a flurry of mergers. Or a rogue insurance company. And that would never happen in <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fcic/fcic.pdf">insurance</a>, just as it would <a href="http://i.cnn.net/cnn/2002/LAW/02/02/enron.report/powers.report.pdf">never happen in energy</a>.</li>
<li>There will be very little demand from banks to buy insurance companies outright, since (a) there are very few Sandy Weill&#8217;s in the market and (b) even Citigroup used to be able to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2001/12/19/ipo/citigroup/index.htm">admit mistakes</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>So what do we have, post-Gramm, Leach, Bliley? A marginal-at-best difference from 1997. The high likelihood that investment banks will lose the battle they&#8217;ve been fighting to less capable but better capitalized entities. A growing encroachment of insurance companies into the banking industry, while bankers go for the easy prey (IBs). The same consolidation and move toward <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/160347-america-a-bona-fide-plutonomy">plutocracy-pandering</a> that was the rule.</p>
<p>Short version: there isn&#8217;t a fundamental change in the management, financing, or control of anything that arises from Gramm-Leach-Bliley or its predecessor. There is, as Ben Bernanke noted, &#8220;<a href="http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2010/09/27/26353/">a failure of economic engineering and economic management</a>,&#8221; but it&#8217;s marginal, and there&#8217;s a strong possibility that the system can recover.</p>
<p>But there are two later pieces of legislation that do cause a fundamental shift. </p>
<p>Next rock: 2000 and 2005; Summers and Biden pillage while Geithner fiddles.</p>
<p>*The more I think about this, the more I expect to fail, for reasons stated elsewhere. But it is <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, so this is at worst part of my 50,000 words.</p>

                                <p>A commenter at <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2011_11/explaining_to_mitch_mcconnell033431.php">Steve Benen&#8217;s Washington Monthly blog</a> was grousing (correctly, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/11/hiroshima-nagasaki-and-largest-absolute.html#comments">as spencer notes in comments</a>) that Benen had allocated all of the 2009 change (read:drop) in private-sector jobs to Obama, while GWB was in office <s>for the first 19.5 days</s>during the time the employment data for January was gathered.</p>
<p>Turns out that there were 841,000 private-sector jobs lost in January of 2009—the most in any month in the 2000s—so it might have made a difference.*</p>
<p>I assumed that, since the population continually increases, that was probably the largest monthly job loss since the data was first recorded in January of 1939.</p>
<p>I was wrong.  By a <strong>wide</strong> margin.  The Top 30 single-month drops in U.S. Private Sector employment history since February of 1939:
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0siKeJp1lQ4/Tr19-m6kSsI/AAAAAAAAAp0/qz9LIVlXmvU/s1600/ToTop30USPRIVdrops.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0siKeJp1lQ4/Tr19-m6kSsI/AAAAAAAAAp0/qz9LIVlXmvU/s320/ToTop30USPRIVdrops.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The highlighted months are since the beginning of NBER&#8217;s declaration of the Great Recession.  But it appears that V-J Day also signalled an end to employment for more than 1.75 million people.</p>
<p>*Note, by the way, that November and December of 2008 are also in the Top Ten, so calling the January, 2009, layoffs part of the normal post-Xmas letdown appears dubious.</p>
