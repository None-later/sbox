                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>As I watched the GOP convention talk about personalities rather than policies – and of course there was their air that McCain is someone morally superior to Obama for some odd reason – a set of thoughts kept filtering up but the words failed me – until I read what <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/a_word_on_mccains_heroism_and.php">Greg Sargent</a> said so well:</p>
<blockquote><p>But why do we have to accept the idea that he&#8217;s also modest and reticent to discuss his own suffering? Why do we have to grant both his heroism and the superior character underlying his supposed reluctance to discuss the experiences that he just talked about in front of a TV audience of millions?</p>
<p>The McCain campaign and the GOP want this campaign to be about one thing: The compared character and experience of the two men running. But elections are also about another niggling detail: What each one is promising to do as president &#8212; that is, their promised agenda and proposed policies.</p>
<p>McCain says he&#8217;ll do some stuff. Obama says he&#8217;ll do other stuff. Polls show overwhelmingly that the American people back the program that Obama is promising. Shows like the one you watched tonight are designed to make you forget this. <br />McCain is offering his character &#8212; hardened by extraordinary suffering &#8212; but is also promising to put that character in service of accomplishing&#8230;very little different than what we&#8217;ve had at the hands of his predecessor.</p>
<p>Obama, too, is offering his biography. And his experiences, while not as overtly dramatic, nonetheless do have resonance for millions and millions of Americans. We&#8217;re supposed to see his experiences as less heroic than his opponent&#8217;s, and that&#8217;s fine &#8212; Obama hasn&#8217;t passed through the same fires McCain has &#8212; but Obama&#8217;s experiences carry weight and resonance for huge chunks of the population.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, the choice isn&#8217;t only between two biographies. It&#8217;s also between a set of promises and aspirations. Obama is offering a series of policy changes &#8212; pulling out of Iraq; changing America&#8217;s posture towards the rest of the world; changing the way foreign policy is discussed in this country; overhauling the tax code; engaging in genuine energy reform &#8212; that McCain isn&#8217;t offering.  Obama may or may not be able to deliver on these promises. But at least he&#8217;s promising to attempt them.</p>
<p>Shows like tonight&#8217;s are meant to persuade you that the election isn&#8217;t about such choices. Instead, you&#8217;re supposed to imagine that the election is a choice between two stories. Between two protagonists. That&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s about at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>We got more really bad news from the labor front.  So how would each candidate address this macroeconomic issue?  Oh yea – McCain sees it as an excuse for more and permanent tax cuts for the rich.  The one he had the good sense to vote against in 2001 did not do so well but now he wants more of the same.</p>

                                <p>Steve Waldman graduated Columbia the year after Barack Obama. His brother Mike was Bill Clinton&#8217;s chief speechwriter.  So when Steve Waldman declared his suspicion that John McCain would get <a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/stevenwaldman/2008/08/jewish-hostility-to-obama.html">the highest percentage of the Jewish vote of any recent Republican,</a> with a link that indicated it <a href="http://www.forward.com/blogs/campaign-confidential/14073/">could put Florida solidly in the Republican column</a>,  I took him seriously.*</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://mystical-politics.blogspot.com/2008/09/jews-for-jesus-speech-at-palins-church.html">Gary Farber&#8217;s ex-girl friend</a>,** I see the Sarah Palin nomination <a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/stevenwaldman/2008/09/palin-the-jewish-vote.html">has caused him to recant this</a>, reasoning (correctly, one suspects) that Jews prefer to vote for people they don&#8217;t trust instead of people who want them killed:<br />
<blockquote>When Isaac was in Jerusalem he was there to witness some of that judgment, some of that conflict, when a Palestinian from East Jerusalem took a bulldozer and went plowing through a score of cars, killing numbers of people. Judgment&#8211;you can&#8217;t miss it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or who refer to your most Orthodox members as &#8220;butchers.&#8221;***<br />
<blockquote>Then I noticed, right out of the corner of my eye, five yeshiva bu[t]chers. Now, that&#8217;s the ultra-orthodox young seminary students. Maybe you&#8217;ve seen the pictures, you know, with the black hats and the black coats, and the side curls, you know. And they were walking towards us with a look of grim determination on their faces, and I knew we were in trouble&#8230;.And I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;, &#8220;That&#8217;s it. We&#8217;re gonna get martyred right here on the streets of Jerusalem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And who then reiterate that you are not the Chosen People until you are Christian:<br />
<blockquote>Our Father in heaven,</p>
<p>We stand before You as a people who&#8217;ve experienced Your grace, and we acknowledge that that grace was first extended to our people through Your people, the Jews; that there is not a one here in this room who would know Jesus and serve Him if there had not been a Jew, generations ago, that spoke Jesus&#8217; name to our people. Father, that comes full circle and we wish to extend Your grace back to Your people. And we pray and we ask that as a result of this time here, and as a result of this offering, there will be people among the Jews today who come to say the name &#8220;Jesus&#8221; with faith.</p>
<p>In His glorious name we pray, amen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now Steve Waldman may be—probably is—correct when he says &#8220;the <em>standard</em> preaching of many evangelical churches will be frightening to some Jews, just as the standard preaching of many African American churches were scary to whites.&#8221; And when he quotes Sarah Palin&#8217;s pastor saying, &#8220;You either receive the King that God has appointed for all mankind or you reject Him. There&#8217;s no neutral ground on that—none,&#8221; he clearly takes that as scary rhetoric.</p>
<p>But there is a difference between scary, &#8220;yeah us!&#8221; rhetoric, and being openly declared second-class citizens, or outright described as &#8220;butchers.&#8221;  Or, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/i-am-confused.html">as Brad DeLong so aptly put it</a>:<br />
<blockquote>John McCain wants to nominate his friend Joe Lieberman for vice president, is told that he cannot, and so he backs down and instead nominates somebody who takes their children to a church where they teach that suicide bombers in Tel Aviv are righteously executing God&#8217;s vengeance on Israel for rejecting Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote>
<p>*That several people in private conversation have suggested doubts about Obama from a Jewish perspective supports the premise.</p>
<p>**Among other things.  She&#8217;s also a long-time friend of my wife&#8217;s.</p>
<p>***Waldman posts the transcript as &#8220;buchers,&#8221; but <em>bucher</em> is Hebrew for &#8220;bookstores,&#8221; and it seems more probable, in the context, that this is a typo.</p>

<blockquote><p>The unemployment rate rose from 5.7 to 6.1 percent in August, and non-farm payroll employment continued to trend down (-84,000)</p></blockquote>
<p>The household survey indicated a 342,000 decline in employment, which led to:</p>
<blockquote><p>The employment-population ratio fell over the month to 62.1 percent in August, down 1.3 percentage points from its most recent high of 63.4 percent in December 2006.</p></blockquote>
<p>This 62.1 percent employment-population ratio for August compares to a 62.4 percent ratio for July and explains the jump in the unemployment rate since the labor force participation rate was unchanged.  It also represents the lowest level since September 2003.</p>
<p>Even before this bad news, <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2008/09/employment-watc.html">David Altig</a> was presenting employment data that would suggest we are in a recession.  As <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/employment-report.html">Spencer</a> notes – Team McCain is shying away from this issue.</p>
<p>Update: pgl&#8230;&#8221; Well we must have a lot of traffic with the number of comments here approaching 90 but it&#8217;s odd that none of them address the employment report for August, which was what this post was about&#8221;</p>
<p>(rdan here&#8230;.sorry to grab the post pgl, but something is going on that is very different, and will stop.  The currents of irrelevant comments is across the spectrum it would seem, with the &#8216;lefties&#8217; starting this one.  Except gang members have no political cover and will simply be considered threadbreakers.  If anyone on either side of the divide respects Angry Bear, please just duck the off topics.  Order gets restored this weekend.)</p>
<p>(Open thread is cancelled today because I will not waste a Friday evening monitoring food fights.  Since this is a group practice we will take a day or two and solve the problem.  To regular readers my apologies&#8230;the format will work, just growing pains from attentive desparadoes)</p>

<p>Alice in Co-payland</p>
<p>Now and then some tiny little headline, like this from the Orlando<br />Business Journal, catches my eye and gives me that old Alice in<br />Wonderland feeling.  Have a quick look:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2008/09/01/daily26.html">Biz journal</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Survey: Most companies will increase health care costs<br />Orlando Business Journal</p>
<p>Fifty-nine percent of companies intend to keep down rising health care<br />costs in 2009 by raising workers&#8217; deductibles, copays or out-of-pocket<br />spending limits, according to a survey by the Mercer consulting firm.</p>
<p>On average, health care costs will rise by an estimated 5.7 percent<br />next year for both workers and their employers. That is equal to this<br />year&#8217;s increase and a 6.1 percent hike in 2007. ..</p></blockquote>
<p>This only looked weird to me because I live in Canada.  So if you didn&#8217;t<br />see what I saw, let me remind you they aren&#8217;t keeping down health<br />care costs &#8212; they&#8217;re shifting a chunk of the cost to employees<br />(those deductables and co-pays) in order to keep down the cost of<br />health insurance.  Insurance agents are not allowed to practice<br />medicine, I am sure.</p>
<p>And oh, for added funniness, this was just below the story online:</p>
<blockquote><p>Related News:</p>

<blockquote><p>For all his talk of reaching across the aisle, McCain got in his jabs at Obama. After all, there are only two months until Election Day. He said Obama would raise taxes, close markets, increase government spending, eliminate jobs. He criticized Obama on energy, health care, and education policies.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Senator McCain claimed that Obama&#8217;s proposal would force people into a health care plan run by government bureaucrats. This is not true. Senator Obama&#8217;s plan would give people the option of buying into a publicly run Medicare-type plan, but this would only be an option. Under Senator Obama&#8217;s plan, no one would be forced to join the public plan, they would be free to stay with their current plan if they chose.  Senator McCain also misrepresented his plan on taxes for ordinary people. He claimed that he would not raise taxes, but his health care plan would raise taxes for tens of millions of middle income workers. McCain proposes making employer payments for health care taxable income. This will be a substantial tax increase for many workers. It also would have been appropriate to note this misrepresentation since Senator McCain has made low taxes so central to his campaign.  As a rule AP is not hesitant to criticize presidential acceptance speeches. The headline for its article on Senator Obama&#8217;s speech was &#8220;Obama Spares Details: Keeps Up Attacks.&#8221; It is worth noting that most other news accounts seem to have ignored Senator McCain&#8217;s misrepresentation of Obama&#8217;s position on this important issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the 2000 campaign, George W. Bush told a lot of lies and the press failed to note how dishonest his campaign was with respect to important policy issues such as government spending and taxes.  The result?  Bush became President.  The same playbook is in force during this election and it seems our press is still incapable of calling dishonesty when they see it.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/04/us/politics/04media.html?_r=2&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;oref=slogin">Jim Rutenberg</a> reports on Team McCain’s attempt to silence real journalism:</p>
<blockquote><p>Those there that night now feel as if they are living in some sort of alternate reality in the Xcel Energy Center here, where Mr. McCain is to accept the Republican nomination on Thursday.  The convention has already included some of the most intense attacks against journalists by a campaign in memory, with Mr. McCain’s aides accusing them of biased, sexist and generally unfair coverage of his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska. In the first three days here, Mr. McCain’s aides have sent out news releases criticizing individual reporters for their coverage. They have canceled an interview with Larry King of CNN to protest what they viewed as unfair questioning of a spokesman by Campbell Brown. They have dismissed as “fiction” an article in The New York Times about the process of vetting Ms. Palin. And Mr. McCain’s chief strategist, Steve Schmidt, has accused journalists here of pursuing a “mission to destroy” Ms. Palin with “a new level of viciousness.” If there is one mission Mr. McCain wants to accomplish at his convention, it is to galvanize conservative voters who have shown signs of depression this year. Traditionally, one surefire way to do that has been to attack the “elitist,” mainstream news media.  And Mr. McCain’s campaign has made its anti-news-media message central to the convention program here. In her first speech before a prime-time national audience Wednesday, as the crowd booed the word “media,” Ms. Palin said, “Here’s a little news flash for those reporters and commentators: I’m not going to Washington to seek their good opinion — I’m going to Washington to serve the people of this great country.”  The accusations of unfairness rebounded around the conservative talk show and commentary circuit, with the conservative columnist Peggy Noonan, for instance, writing that Ms. Palin “could become a transformative political presence,” and that therefore the “American left” and Mr. Obama’s campaign “are going to have to kill her, and kill her quick.” But, seeming to undermine the campaign’s argument that questions about Ms. Palin stem from bias, Ms. Noonan was heard on a live microphone on MSNBC answering a question about Ms. Palin’s experience: “Most qualified?” she said. “No.” Using a barnyard epithet, she said Mr. McCain had chosen Ms. Palin more for her personal story. “Every time Republicans do that,” she said, “they blow it.” A former McCain strategist, Mike Murphy, agreed, saying, “The greatest of McCain is no cynicism, and it is cynical.” Ms. Noonan later apologized for the epithet on The Journal’s Web site and said she liked Ms. Palin. Some of the friction with the news media was a natural outcome of Mr. McCain’s choice of a relatively unknown running mate, sending the press corps to vet her and raise questions about whether Mr. McCain had done so thoroughly enough. But his aides said the reporting had included inaccuracies and unfair approaches. They pointed to the cover of Us Weekly, which features a photograph of Ms. Palin and the words “Babies, Lies and Scandals.” Us is owned by Jann Wenner, a supporter of Senator Barack Obama. A cover in June featured Mr. Obama and his family with the headline, “Why Barack Loves Her.”  “We’d vastly prefer to criticize our opponent’s record before we ever criticize the media’s,” said Tucker Bounds, the spokesman who scrapped with Ms. Brown of CNN. “But there has to be attention given to the fact that reporters are not being responsible brokers of information.” But the campaign’s attacks on the news media have been viewed by journalists and some strategists here as also serving tactical needs. Among them are to build a case that Ms. Palin is a victim of sexism, to change the subject, or, in the words of Leonard Downie Jr., the executive editor of The Washington Post, “to put boundaries on the press’s pursuit of the Palin story.” That Mr. McCain is behind these emphatic attacks has startled many, especially those journalists who have known Mr. McCain longest. “Probably no one in American politics over the last 20 years has had a closer relationship with the national press than John McCain,” said Albert R. Hunt, the executive Washington editor for Bloomberg News.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those of us who thought the Bush-Cheney campaigns in 2000 and 2004 were the most dishonest points in American politics we’d see in our lifetimes were simply wrong – Team McCain lies at every turn and then attacks the media when the truth might be raising its head.</p>

<p>Summary: Real negative interest rates rob people. The US has endured<br />five periods of real negative interest rates since 1954 &#8211; two of which<br />have occurred since 2002. It was the 2002-2005 period of negative<br />interest rates which saw the expansion of the housing bubble. Now that<br />it has popped, is the current bout of negative interest rates going to<br />limit the recession or will it make it worse?</p>
<p>Quotes:<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />While I agree that the subprime crisis and the credit crunch that has<br />followed has a deflationary effect, I also believe that high oil prices<br />and a low US Dollar have created an inflationary environment as well.<br />More than that, I believe that the net effect of these crises will end<br />up on the inflationary side of things. Moreover, I can see a<br />stagflationary environment (5% inflation plus 5% unemployment)<br />developing over the course of the year.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />It seems reasonably clear from this latter graph that Greenspan&#8217;s rate<br />cuts after the tech boom went way too far. The early 80s rate cuts and<br />the early 90s rate cuts were far more staggered, while the 2001 cuts<br />were like jumping off a cliff. It could be argued, therefore, that<br />America&#8217;s monetary policy, post-2001, has been dangerous, imbalanced<br />and, well, incompetent. Not only was inflation allowed to exceed<br />interest rates, but it created a bubble that, when popped, has resulted<br />in yet another period of negative real saving.</p>
<p>In other words, what caused the problem is being used to solve it.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />The US economy has only diced with negative real rates five times since<br />1954: 1957-1958, 1974-1980, 1994, 2002-2005 and 2008 (the last one is<br />ongoing). The fact that the last two have occurred so quickly is what is<br />so unusual.</p>
<p>Let me explain again what the problem with negative interest rates are:<br />They punish people for saving while rewarding them for spending; they<br />punish people for lending and reward people for borrowing; they punish<br />people who are judicious and reward those who are careless. In short,<br />negative real interest rates are a recipe for economic disaster.</p>
<p>This, in turn, is one reason why I have argued for years that central<br />banks, including the Fed, should focus clearly on reducing inflation.<br />Employment, which is of vital importance to society, and businesses, who<br />make the decision to employ people, both need economic growth. But<br />economic growth, to be sustainable over the long term, needs to have low<br />inflation and positive real interest rates.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
