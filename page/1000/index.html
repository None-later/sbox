                                <p>A week ago, <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001906.html">Dean Baker</a> wrote:<br />
<blockquote>The latest news about Iran should be very scary to anyone old enough to remember the 2002 elections. Those who lived in that distant time will remember a president slumping in the polls in the wake of a sinking economy and an accounting scandal that centered on his Texas buddies at Enron. Recognizing the seriousness of the situation, President Bush’s team began raising the warning about Saddam Hussein and his WMDs.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wanted to say that Dean’s concern was tempered by this August 2005 article by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/01/AR2005080101453.html">Dafna Linzer</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A major U.S. intelligence review has projected that Iran is about a decade away from manufacturing the key ingredient for a nuclear weapon, roughly doubling the previous estimate of five years, according to government sources with firsthand knowledge of the new analysis. The carefully hedged assessments, which represent consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies, contrast with forceful public statements by the White House. Administration officials have asserted, but have not offered proof, that Tehran is moving determinedly toward a nuclear arsenal &#8230; At no time in the past three years has the White House attributed its assertions about Iran to U.S. intelligence, as it did about Iraq in the run-up to the March 2003 invasion. Instead, it has pointed to years of Iranian concealment and questioned why a country with as much oil as Iran would require a large-scale nuclear energy program.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, ten years away is no imminent threat I said – and then I read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/17/AR2006011700893.html">Charles Krauthammer</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Makes you want to weep. One day earlier, Britain, France and Germany admitted that their two years of talks to stop Iran&#8217;s nuclear weapons program had collapsed. The Iranians had broken the seals on their nuclear facilities and were resuming activity in defiance of their pledges to the &#8220;E.U. Three.&#8221; &#8230; Ah, success. Instead of being years away from the point of no return for an Iranian bomb, as we were before we allowed Europe to divert anti-proliferation efforts into transparently useless talks, Iran is probably just months away. And now, of course, Iran is run by an even more radical government, led by a president who fervently believes in the imminence of the apocalypse. Ah, success. Having delayed two years, we now have to deal with a set of fanatical Islamists who we know will not be deterred from pursuing nuclear weapons by any sanctions. Even if we could get real sanctions. Which we will not. The remaining months before Iran goes nuclear are about to be frittered away in pursuit of this newest placebo.</p></blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t this Euro-bashing remind us of the 2002 UN-bashing?   I happen to trust the intelligence review even if Krauthammer does not.  There is no imminent threat from Iran.  But is it wise to trust Karl Rove not to be an imminent threat?  Which I guess was Dean’s point.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>It should come as no surprise to anyone that, partly as a result of a persistently higher-than-average rate of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/cost-of-medical-care.html">inflation in medical care</a>, consumers have been spending a larger and larger fraction of their income on medical care.  </p>
<p>So how much of household spending actually goes to health care?  Well, that depends on whom you ask.</p>
<p>One good estimate is provided by the thorough surveys done by the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm">BLS</a> to try to estimate the consumer price index.  The BLS provides a measure of the relative importance of various sorts of expenditures in the average household budget. The following chart shows how the portion of household spending devoted to medical care has steadily grown over the past two decades.  The chart breaks spending down in to two parts: direct out-of-pocket spending on health care, and individual premiums for health insurance.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/med_spending1.jpg"></p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that out-of-pocket health insurance premia actually remained quite constant through much of the 1990s, only to resume their rapid rise since the year 2000.  Most of the explanation for this is the massive shift of workers into HMOs during the 1990s, which were generally cheaper than traditional health insurance plans, in part because they covered less medical treatment.</p>
<p>Another measure of the importance of health care spending can be gleaned from  national income accounting statistics from the <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">BEA</a>.  The next chart shows the BEA&#8217;s measure of spending on medical care as a percent of total personal spending, and in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/med_spending2.jpg"></p>
<p>A couple of comments.  First, the BEA figures show a much greater proportion of spending going toward medical care, largely because the BEA includes payments by health insurance plans for medical care while the BLS figures shown in the first chart only include out-of-pocket payments by households.</p>
<p>Second, it is very interesting to notice that spending on medical care as a percent of total spending shows the same period of stability between 1992-2000 as the BLS figures on health insurance spending showed above.  The most compelling explanation for this period of stable health care spending of all types is therefore also the widespread shift of workers into HMOs during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Finally, notice what&#8217;s happened in the past few years: after that long period of stability, spending on medical care has risen dramatically since 2000.  Presumably, everyone who could be shifted into an HMO had made the switch by 2000, so that source of cost savings had been exhausted.</p>
<p>Most interestingly, the BEA data attributes much of this increase in health care&#8217;s budget share to an increase in <em>real</em> medical care spending, not to inflation.  In other words, the rapid advances in health care spending during the 2000s are largely due to the fact that individuals are consuming more health care, according to the BEA.</p>
<p>This seems rather at odds with the experiences of most people that I know.  What are some possible explanations?  I can think of a few.  It may be the case that HMOs are simply covering more medical services than they used to, and so individuals are indeed consuming more.  Or, it may be the case that the overall quality of medical care has improved, so that (for example) delivering a baby or getting a knee replaced is safer and more effective than it used to be.  In that case, 100 procedures performed today will be measured as greater consumption of real medical services than those same 100 procedures performed five years ago.  </p>
<p>A third possible explanation involves mis-measurement of inflation in medical care.  It is extremely difficult to differentiate between pure price changes and changes in quality when it comes to medical care.  The <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/cpifact4.htm">BLS document</a> that I cited yesterday notes the following:<br />
<blockquote>There is a growing consensus that the most appropriate way to measure hospital services is by tracking treatment outcomes rather than medical inputs consumed. From this vantage point, a day spent occupying a hospital room and the time in an operating room are not separate consumer services, but individual components of one hospital visit which may be all or part of a medical treatment. The current CPI method follows medical treatments, a method that lies between the old medical-inputs method and the ideal medical-outcomes method. Measuring the value of different treatment outcomes is the subject of research in the industry, but not yet a feasible methodology for the CPI medical care indexes.</p></blockquote>
<p>If it is the case that receiving any particular outcome (e.g. getting that knee replacement mentioned above) involves more elaborate and costly procedures but yields substantially the same outcome, then current statistical methods will show an increase in real medical services although they yield the same outcome as before.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the answers as to what is underlying dramatic change in medical care spending of the past few years.  But clearly its an important question, because it plays a crucial role in understanding whether the rapid rise in people&#8217;s spending on health care in recent years is a good thing or bad.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;The United States faces a ruthless enemy, and we need a commander in chief and a Congress who understand the nature of the threat and the gravity of the moment America finds itself in,&#8221; Mr. Rove said. &#8220;President Bush and the Republican Party do. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for many Democrats.&#8221; &#8220;Let me be as clear as I can be: President Bush believes if Al Qaeda is calling somebody in America, it is in our national security interest to know who they&#8217;re calling and why,&#8221; Mr. Rove said, referring to the program in which the National Security Agency eavesdropped on conversations without getting a warrant from a judge. &#8220;Some important Democrats clearly disagree.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Last refuge of a scoundrel?  Try a serial liar who is more interested in attacking patriotic Democrats than making Americans safe from terrorism.  Kevin ties this outrageous lie from Karl Rove to the corruption issue writing:<br />
<blockquote>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong here. Corruption is a good issue for Dems if they can bring themselves to stop being so damn timid about it, and it&#8217;s also possible that Republicans will eventually discover that they&#8217;ve gone to the terrorism well once too often. Maybe. But I wouldn&#8217;t bet the ranch on it. Banging away on both corruption and the broader topic of Republican fealty to corporate special interests may help Democrats at the polls this year, but I don&#8217;t think national security is going away either. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not getting a sense that Dems are spending much time thinking about that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe our Democratic leaders are too timid but I’m stunned at the timidity of what Kevin writes here.  We Democrats are spending too little time thinking about national security?  Is he kidding?  We are thinking about national security – but whatever we say is either ignored by the Administration or twisted by their minions to accuse us of being soft on terrorism. </p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong – Kevin Drum is one of my favorite political bloggers, but this post was not up to his usual standards.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/corruption_in_washington_/2006/01/corruption_and_national_security.php">Mark Kleiman</a> provides the extra paragraph that I was hoping to see in Kevin’s post:<br />
<blockquote>It seems to me that the Democrats&#8217; play is obvious: point out that the Republicans have been stealing from the defense budget, using the Iraq adventure as a partisan piggy-bank and employment service, and otherwise sacrificing national security for corrupt partisan advantage. Repeat after me: &#8220;The price of Duke Cunningham&#8217;s Rolls-Royce would have bought a lot of body armor for the troops.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So if Karl Rove wants to talk about national security, great.  Let’s just point out how utterly incompetent this Administration has been at it.  Yes, we Democrats need to put forth our own agenda, but my point is many Democrats have been – only to have the rightwing either deny our suggestions or simply twist our words for partisan advantage.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>While <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200601200817.asp">John Tamny</a> does not explicitly have <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/113810">Dark Matter</a> in mind, his criticism of Martin Feldstein largely rest on the thesis:<br />
<blockquote>When he served under President Reagan as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, Martin Feldstein called for a weaker dollar to reduce the U.S. deficit in the current account … Nearly twenty years later, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading at levels nearly four-times higher than when Feldstein initially sounded the alarm, the U.S. economy is still somehow imperiled as a result of investor interest in our public and private assets. Although Adam Smith saw capital inflows as “the effect, not the cause, of public prosperity,” Feldstein apparently sees them in a reverse light. According to his January 10 op-ed in the Financial Times, they’re indicative of a looming dollar crash … The problem here is that there’s no discernible correlation between the current account deficit and the value of the dollar … Feldstein is of the belief that the present level of foreign investment in the U.S. is unsustainable. Leaving aside how long the “sky-is-falling” crowd has been incorrect, what’s unsustainable is not the deficit itself, but the causes of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, we should be praising Martin Feldstein for his wisdom a generation ago – as well as his latest wisdom.  While Tamny notes that the nominal value of stocks may be substantially higher now than twenty years ago, note that nominal GDP has also tripled over this time period (can you say price increases and population growth).  It is true that household net wealth is about 4 times GDP versus 3.35 times GDP twenty years ago.  Twenty years ago, the U.S. investments abroad roughly equaled foreign investments in the U.S.  Today, foreign investments in the U.S. exceed U.S. investments abroad by roughly $3 trillion or 25% of GDP.  Feldstein and many others are worried that this foreign indebtedness will continue to rise relative to our national income.  </p>
<p>Tamny suggests correctly that we should examine the causes of the current account deficit.  First of all, correlations between the exchange rate and the current account do not get at the cause and effect relationships.  Feldstein was certainly not saying the exchange rate was the exogenous variable.  Rather, the exchange rate is an endogenous variable that responds to factors such as the relationship between national savings and investment.  We at the Angrybear have been arguing that it is this lack of national savings that has created the underlying conditions for why we have to rely on borrowing from abroad to finance the modest amount of investment that the U.S. is currently doing.  If we ever get around to fiscal responsibility, then the consequence should be a weaker dollar and improved net exports.</p>

                                <p>Some members of the FOMC are indicating that the Fed will be raising interest rates a little, but only a little bit more:<br />
<blockquote>LOS ANGELES (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/20/news/economy/fed_officials.reut/index.htm">Reuters</a>) &#8211; The Federal Reserve has lifted interest rates to more appropriate levels amid solid economic growth, policy-makers said Thursday in remarks that hint the U.S. central bank will raise rates just a few more times.</p>
<p>Financial markets bet the Fed will raise its benchmark fed funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.50 percent at its next meeting on Jan. 31. Observers also give a slightly better than 50/50 chance that rates will be raised again, to 4.75 percent, at the following meeting on March 28.</p>
<p>When asked by a reporter if the Fed was close to concluding its 1 1/2-year program of rate rises, San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen replied: &#8220;Given what I know and what I&#8217;ve seen about the economy, based on the data, probably yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, the Fed is &#8220;not finished&#8221; and probably has &#8220;some&#8221; moves left to go, said Yellen, a voting member of the Fed&#8217;s rate-setting committee this year, after taking part in an economic panel discussion in Los Angeles.</p></blockquote>
<p>These comments are pretty much in line with almost everyone&#8217;s expectations, which is probably good.  Nevertheless, I am starting to worry a bit that, as the economy slows in 2006, we could find ourselves with an excessively <em>tight</em> monetary policy before too long&#8230;</p>

                                <p>In keeping with my New Year’s resolution, let me say that I agree with <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/factor_kerpen200601190908.asp">Mallory Factor &#038; Phil Kerpen</a> with respect to at least part of the following:<br />
<blockquote>Currently, the long-term fiscal-policy outlook is bleak. A report issued last month by the Congressional Budget Office shows that federal spending as a percentage of the U.S. economy, a number that has never historically deviated much from 20 percent, is now scheduled to nearly double in size to 38 percent by 2050.</p></blockquote>
<p>Factor &#038; Kerpen are rightfully concerned about the tax burden that we will bestow upon our children and grandchildren if we continue to have current taxes set below government spending.  But when they bash the “Liberal public employee unions”, they somehow lose me – especially when they say the following:<br />
<blockquote>Government employees understandably would like to see the government take over as much of the U.S. economy as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find this allegation odd for several reasons.  The first reason relates to the following chart that shows the ratio of government employees to total employment (data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics).  Note that this ratio fell from 1993 to 2000 and then rose as a result of the increase in our security efforts following 9/11.  This ratio subsequently fell with the percentage of employment from the government now being around 16.25% as compared to around 17.25% when Bill Clinton took office.  So with a smaller share of employees working for the government, I thought the position of Factor &#038; Kerpen might be that public employees had received some massive increase in their real compensation.  In terms of total compensation relative to the consumer price index, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that those in public administration receive 8.67% more than they did at the beginning of 1993 as compared to a 7.41% increase in real compensation for all civilian employees.  </p>

<p>So why are Factor &#038; Kerpen angry at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the Service Employees International Union?  It seems that Factor &#038; Kerpen want to reduce “entitlement spending” and they do not like <a href="http://www.actnow.org/video/simmons_index.php">this ad</a> where Act Now is opposing the efforts of the GOP to have an $8 billion per year reduction in spending following by tax cuts that are about twice as large.  If Factor &#038; Kerpen think reducing transfer payments by $8 billion and reducing taxes by $16 billion will reduce the deficit, they must be practicing new math.  </p>
<p>Of course, the real problem is that they have confused <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=transfer%20payments">transfer payments</a> with <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=government%20purchases">government purchases</a>.  As we noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/2006-year-of-small-government.html">here</a> the ratio of non-defense Federal purchases to GDP has not change very much over the past half century.  Factor &#038; Kerpen are concerned that transfer payments will rise over time.  The long-run balanced budget constraint dictates that someone’s net taxes (taxes minus transfer payments) have to increase if policy makers cannot find a way to slash government purchases (a reasonable assumption).  So I share their general concern.  I would just hope someone over at the National Review finally realizes the difference between transfer payments and government purchases.</p>

                                <p>It looks like Bush is going to spend a fair bit of his State of the Union address talking about <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/bush_state_of_union;_ylt=AiIAklKJ6lbW.70_ES6xNxes0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA2Z2szazkxBHNlYwN0bQ--">rising health care costs</a>.  I’ve argued for a long time (yes, I realize that I’m not the only one) that health care is probably the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/real-crisis.html">biggest domestic problem</a> that the US will face over the medium and long term.  </p>
<p>Here at Angry Bear we&#8217;ve devoted a fair amount of time discussing the topic of health care (see the posts under &#8220;The US Health Care System&#8221; at left for some examples).  But those posts focus more on the performance of the US health care system than on how medical costs affect individual households.  So over the next week or two I&#8217;ll be putting up some data illustrating how health care costs and burdens on individuals have changed over the past couple of decades.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;ll start with one simple measure of the rise in health care costs: the CPI measure of the price of medical care, from the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm">BLS</a>.  The following chart shows the annual inflation rate in medical care, compared to all other items that consumers buy.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/med_care_cpi.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that this indicator of health care inflation measures the prices of out-of-pocket medical expenses, including insurance premia that individuals pay.  (For details about the CPI data on medical care inflation, see <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/cpifact4.htm">this publication</a>.) In other words, it does not measure inflation in health insurance coverage provided by employers.  </p>
<p>Part of what I hope to do over the next week is explore some of the implications for households of the fact that health insurance is frequently provided by employers in the US.  Be prepared to be a bit depressed.</p>

First, let’s begin with a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=email_us&#038;refer=news_index&#038;sid=azvCEhXtl1g0">Bloomberg</a> discussion:<br />
<blockquote>Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) &#8211; American workers have rarely taken home a smaller share of the nation&#8217;s prosperity, a condition that is undermining bipartisan support for free trade and creating friction between President George W. Bush&#8217;s administration and the Federal Reserve. After 16 consecutive quarters of economic growth, pay is rising at a slower rate than in any similar expansion since the end of World War II. Companies are paying less of their cash gains in the form of wages and salaries than at any time since the Great Depression, according to government figures … &#8220;There is no doubt that something is happening&#8221; to reduce labor&#8217;s share of income, says Robert Solow, a Nobel Prize- winning economist and professor emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. An economy that doesn&#8217;t distribute its gains widely is &#8220;poorly performing,&#8221; he says. From the final quarter of 2001 through last year&#8217;s third quarter, total compensation paid to employees by corporations, including health benefits, rose at a 4.3 percent average annual rate, according to government figures. That&#8217;s the slowest growth for any similar period in post-war expansions lasting at least four years.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_buzzcharts/buzzcharts200601131017.asp">Jerry Bowyer</a> might look at the same facts and conclude that this is good news for employment:<br />
<blockquote>Not all jobs are created equal. Some are volatile and speculative, and some are backed by real, existing profits. As it turns out, the jobs created over the last several years are backed by record levels of corporate profit. From 2001 to 2005, we’ve seen a 1.4 percent increase in payroll jobs. But over that same period of time, we’ve seen corporate profits jump from $767 billion to $1.3 trillion — an increase of more than 70 percent. This is in stark contrast to the job boom of the late 1990s, which greatly outpaced the growth of corporate profits. From 1997 to 2000, corporate profits actually decreased from $868 billion to $817 billion, a drop of almost 6 percent. Over that same time period, payroll jobs increased from 122 million to 131 million &#8211; a jump of 7.4 percent. Profits were dropping, but corporations kept hiring new workers anyway. It follows that since today’s jobs are backed by rapidly growing profits, they should be more stable than the ones created in the late 1990s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did I say the same facts?  My mistake – as corporate profits represent a subset of the profits from American businesses.  So there could be several explanations of differences in the growth of corporate profits and payroll employment growth.  Our chart, however, looks at overall national income, which is roughly divided between labor income and capital income.  It does show that profits have been growing faster than national income, which is the flip side of the declining labor share.  <br />Bowyer wants us to believe that the share of income going to capital income must grow before we see sustained employment growth.  We should note, however, that the two periods where the capital share fell – the late 1990’s and the late 1970’s – also saw much higher employment growth than we have seen over the past five years.</p>
<p>Bowyer also offers us no microeconomic or macroeconomic reason to believe that rising profits are necessary for increasing employment growth.  Let’s toss a few counterexamples – two from the macroeconomics that Solow is referring to and one from microeconomics.  The first macroeconomic counterexample comes from the premise that weak aggregate demand tends to depress wages, which was discussed in the Bloomberg article.  The second macroeconomic counterexample comes from long-run economic growth considerations (as in Solow’s writings from the late 1950’s).  The fact that national savings and investment have been crowded-out by Bush’s fiscal irresponsibility, the capital-labor ratio would tend to fall, which means less real wage growth and a higher return to the capital stock.  The impact on the labor share depends on the elasticity of substitution.  If this elasticity of substitution is less than unity, a lower savings rate would suggest a falling labor share over the long-run.</p>
<p>The microeconomic counterexample comes from the comparison of labor demand under competition versus monopsony.  Competitive firms hire labor up to the point where the value of labor’s marginal product equals the competitive wage rate.  The accounting profits for these entities will cover only the opportunity cost of capital with no economic profit.  If these firms, however, can create a monopsony cartel, they could extract economic profits by curtailing employment.</p>

<blockquote>The Supreme Court delivered a rebuff to the Bush administration over physician-assisted suicide today, rejecting a Justice Department effort to bar doctors in Oregon from helping terminally ill patients end their lives under a 1994 state law. In a 6-3 vote, the court ruled that then-U.S. Attorney General John D. Ashcroft overstepped his authority in 2001 by trying to use a federal drug law to prosecute doctors who prescribed lethal overdoses under the Oregon Death With Dignity Act, the only law in the nation that allows physician-assisted suicide. The measure has been approved twice by Oregon voters and upheld by lower court rulings. Faced with lower court rulings against his position, Ashcroft brought the case to the Supreme Court on the day he announced his resignation in November 2004. The case was continued by his successor as attorney general, Alberto R. Gonzales. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., dissenting for the first time since he joined the court in September, sided with the two most conservative justices &#8211; Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas &#8211; in voting for the minority view. At issue was whether the federal Controlled Substances Act, enacted in 1970 to combat drug abuse and trafficking, allowed the attorney general unilaterally to prohibit doctors in Oregon from prescribing regulated drugs for use in physician-assisted suicide, despite state law permitting them to do so. Writing the opinion of the court, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the federal law bars doctors from using prescriptions to engage in illicit drug dealing but that &#8220;the statute manifests no intent to regulate the practice of medicine generally.&#8221; Moreover, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) relies on &#8220;a functioning medical profession regulated under the states&#8217; police powers,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;In the face of the CSA&#8217;s silence on the practice of medicine generally and its recognition of state regulation of the medical profession, it is difficult to defend the Attorney General&#8217;s declaration that the statute impliedly criminalizes physician-assisted suicide,&#8221; Kennedy wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the Alito hearings, the Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee – using the wiretapping controversy as background – pressed Judge Alito whether the President could ignore the intent of Congress after a law has been passed.  Alito hedged on this question.  In other words, Alito would not say whether a President could simply ignore a law.  </p>
<p>In this case, the President wanted to simply make up authority that Congress had not granted the Executive Branch.  It would seem Justices Roberts, Scalia, and Thomas are not bothered by the excessive reach of the Executive Branch.  If Alito has the same view, isn’t this another reason to not approve his nomination to the Supreme Court?</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/alito_/2006/01/judging_and_personal_beliefs.php">Mark Kleiman</a> has more criticism of the dissenting opinion written by Scalia.</p>
