                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23286149-2703,00.html">Peter Wilson</a> of the Australian is really hard on those in the Bush Administration who forecasted a modest price tag for that stupid decision on March 19, 2003.  Time out a second – why pick on them when you have Bill Kristol who said in 2002 that the cost of this war would be a mere 0.2% of GDP translating into a predicted price tag near $20 billion.  But let’s give Peter the microphone:</p>
<blockquote><p>The former World Bank vice-president yesterday said the war had, so far, cost the US something like $US3trillion ($3.3 trillion) compared with the $US50-$US60-billion predicted in 2003 &#8230; Professor Stiglitz told the Chatham House think tank in London that the Bush White House was currently estimating the cost of the war at about $US500 billion, but that figure massively understated things such as the medical and welfare costs of US military servicemen. The war was now the second-most expensive in US history after World War II and the second-longest after Vietnam, he said. The spending on Iraq was a hidden cause of the current credit crunch because the US central bank responded to the massive financial drain of the war by flooding the American economy with cheap credit. &#8220;The regulators were looking the other way and money was being lent to anybody this side of a life-support system,&#8221; he said. That led to a housing bubble and a consumption boom, and the fallout was plunging the US economy into recession and saddling the next US president with the biggest budget deficit in history, he said. Professor Stiglitz, an academic at the Columbia Business School and a former economic adviser to president Bill Clinton, said a further $US500 billion was going to be spent on the fighting in the next two years and that could have been used more effectively to improve the security and quality of life of Americans and the rest of the world. The money being spent on the war each week would be enough to wipe out illiteracy around the world, he said. Just a few days&#8217; funding would be enough to provide health insurance for US children who were not covered, he said. The public had been encouraged by the White House to ignore the costs of the war because of the belief that the war would somehow pay for itself or be paid for by Iraqi oil or US allies. &#8220;When the Bush administration went to war in Iraq it obviously didn&#8217;t focus very much on the cost. Larry Lindsey, the chief economic adviser, said the cost was going to be between $US100billion and $US200 billion &#8211; and for that slight moment of quasi-honesty he was fired. &#8220;(Then defence secretary Donald) Rumsfeld responded and said &#8216;baloney&#8217;, and the number the administration came up with was $US50 to $US60 billion. We have calculated that the cost was more like $US3 trillion. &#8220;Three trillion is a very conservative number, the true costs are likely to be much larger than that.&#8221; Five years after the war, the US was still spending about $US50billion every three months on direct military costs, he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>As an economist, however, I would think we should look at the benefits as well as the costs.  After all, this war had revived Al Qaeda, made Iran the king of the hill in the Middle East, and made our own allies suspicious of our motives.  Oh wait a second – these may not be benefits after all.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>There is a stereotype that Republicans care about big business but not the little guy.   Here is a story of <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/14729.html">GW living up to that stereotype</a>, courtesy of Steve Benen:</p>
<blockquote><p>A reporter at this morning’s White House press conference asked the president <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/02/20080228-2.html">an interesting question</a> I haven’t heard Bush respond to before: “You can get the Congress to protect telecom companies from lawsuits, but then there’s no recourse for Americans who feel that they’ve been caught up in this. I know it’s not intended to spy on Americans, but in the collection process, information about everybody gets swept up and then it gets sorted. So if Americans don’t have any recourse, are you just telling them, when it comes to their privacy, to suck it up?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Steve Benen then has this video&#8230;</p>
<p>And this transcript:</p>
<blockquote><p>THE PRESIDENT: I wouldn’t put it that way, if I were you, in public. Well, you’ve been long been long enough to — anyway, yes, I — look, there’s — people who analyze the program fully understand that America’s civil liberties are well protected. There is a constant check to make sure that our civil liberties of our citizens aren’t — you know, are treated with respect. And that’s what I want, and that’s what most — all Americans want.</p>
<p>Now let me talk about the phone companies. You cannot expect phone companies to participate if they feel like they’re going to be sued. I mean, it is — these people are responsible for shareholders; they’re private companies. The government said to those who have alleged to have helped us that it is in our national interests and it’s legal. It’s in our national interests because we want to know who’s calling who from overseas into America. We need to know in order to protect the people.</p>
<p>It was legal. And now, all of a sudden, plaintiffs attorneys, class-action plaintiffs attorneys, you know — I don’t want to try to get inside their head; I suspect they see, you know, a financial gravy train — are trying to sue these companies. First, it’s unfair. It is patently unfair. And secondly, these lawsuits create doubts amongst those who will — whose help we need.</p>
<p>I guess you could be relaxed about all this if you didn’t think there was a true threat to the country. I know there’s a threat to the country. And the American people expect our Congress to give the professionals the tools they need to listen to foreigners who may be calling into the United States with information that could cause us great harm. So, on the one hand, the civil liberties of our citizens are guaranteed by a lot of checks in the system, scrutinized by the United States Congress.</p>
<p>And secondly, I cannot emphasize to you how important it is that the Congress solve this problem. The Senate has solved the problem. And people say, would you ever compromise on the issue? The Senate bill is a compromise. And there’s enough votes in the House of Representatives to pass the Senate bill. It’s a bipartisan bill. And the House leaders need to put it on the floor, let the will of the House work. In my judgment, it happens to be the will of the people, to give the professionals the tools they need to protect the country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Long story short, GW is telling us that our civil liberties are well protected, and we should just trust him.  No recourse is necessary because&#8230; he tells us no recourse is necessary.  </p>
<p>GW has also managed to get his stereotype of a Republican attitude onto the Supreme Court, according to this story by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/27/AR2008022703207.html?hpid=topnews">Dana Milbank at the Washington Post</a>  (hat tip:  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/02/28/chief-justice-roberts-defends-exxon/">Think Progress</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Exxon Mobil, the giant oil corporation appearing before the Supreme Court yesterday, had earned a profit of nearly $40 billion in 2006, the largest ever reported by a U.S. company &#8212; but that&#8217;s not what bothered Roberts. What bothered the chief justice was that Exxon was being ordered to pay $2.5 billion &#8212; roughly three weeks&#8217; worth of profits &#8212; for destroying a long swath of the Alaska coastline in the largest oil spill in American history.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what can a corporation do to protect itself against punitive-damages awards such as this?&#8221; Roberts asked in court.</p>
<p>The lawyer arguing for the Alaska fishermen affected by the spill, Jeffrey Fisher, had an idea. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it can hire fit and competent people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rare sound of laughter rippled through the august chamber. The chief justice did not look amused.</p>
<p>Perhaps, though, his consternation was misplaced. Everybody knows the wheels of justice turn slowly, but in the case of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, things have dragged on so long that Lady Justice&#8217;s blindness could reasonably be attributed to cataracts. </p>
<p>Nineteen years after the Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound and spilled 11 million gallons of oil, the 32,000 plaintiffs &#8212; mostly fishermen, cannery workers and Native Alaskans &#8212; have received no punitive damages from Exxon.</p>
<p>A jury awarded them $5 billion in punitive damages &#8212; a record level, for a record disaster &#8212; and an appeals court cut that in half. Now, the Supreme Court seems inclined to deal another insult to the victims (as many as a fifth of whom have already died) by cutting the award further. </p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, its simple.  A lot of damage was done.  1,200 miles of coastline were covered with oil.  Livelihoods were destroyed.  Someone has to bear the burden.  In theory, it can be the company that caused the damage, or it can be everyone else.  So far its been everyone else.  Our esteemed Supreme Court Chief Justice, and several of our other esteemed Justices apparently intend to keep it that way.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Y&#8217;all might recall it wasn&#8217;t long ago that the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/05/AR2007080501299.html">US government spent $2.8 billion buying weapons for Iraq</a> from former Soviet bloc countries, and then promptly lost 190,000 AK-47s.  (&#8220;Lost&#8221; weapons, of course, included those delivered inadvertently to the insurgency.)  </p>
<p>After all of that, <a href="http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,162878,00.html?wh=wh">Iraqis are switching from AK-47s to M-16s</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a move that could be the most enduring imprint of U.S. influence in the Arab world, American military officials in Baghdad have begun a crash program to outfit the entire Iraqi army with M-16 rifles.</p>
<p>The initiative marks a sharp break for a culture steeped in the traditions of the Soviet-era AK-47 Kalashnikov assault rifle, a symbol of revolutionary zeal and third-world simplicity that is ubiquitous among the militaries of the Middle East.</p>
<p>&#8220;We in the U.S. know that the M-16 is superior to the AK &#8230; it&#8217;s more durable,&#8221; said Army Col. Stephen Scott, who&#8217;s in charge of helping the Iraqi army get all the equipment it needs to outfit its forces.</p></blockquote>
<p>This may be the first time anyone has ever said the M-16 is more durable than the AK-47.  The AK-47 is used all over the developing world precisely because it is durable, and cheap.  The M-16 is more accurate, especially at a distance, but durable it isn&#8217;t.  </p>
<p>The situation is so inane that Confederate Yankee, a guy who is as much of a cheerleader for the Bush administration&#8217;s happy adventure in Iraq as you will find,  <a href="http://confederateyankee.mu.nu/archives/256653.php">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>My immediate response upon reading this is simple: which defense contractor most benefits from this deal, and how much did they pay to make it happen?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if that is a fair question to ask, but I&#8217;m being as honest as I know how: transitioning the Iraqi military to the M16/M4 family of weapons has all the hallmarks of creating or exacerbating a problem, not solving one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its long past time that people start doing time for corruption associated with this whole mess, starting with the former Heritage Foundation interns who handed out all the sacks of money that somehow or other disappeared going all the way to congresscritters and administration officials who put their personal interests above the national interest and the the lives of American soldiers.  (And yes, I really don&#8217;t give a $%#^ which party they come from.)</p>

<blockquote><p>The news isn&#8217;t good. The PPI is on the rise. (MSNBC)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Battered by bad economic news, consumer confidence plunged while wholesale food, energy and medicine costs soared, pushing inflation up at the fastest pace in a quarter century.<br />The Labor Department said Tuesday that wholesale inflation jumped by 1 percent in January, more than double the increase that analysts had been expecting.<br />The next paragraph isn&#8217;t about inflation, but isn&#8217;t great either&#8230;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the New York-based Conference Board reported that its confidence index fell to 75.0 in February, down from a revised January reading of 87.3. The drop was far below the 83 reading that analysts had forecast and put the index at its lowest level since February 2003, a period that reflected anxiety in the lead up to the Iraq war.<br />And on another note, I was revising my homework solutions for my principles of macro course this semester. I always ask students to find the most recent rate of inflation by the CPI (12 month % change). Last semester, the answer was 2.0% at the time I asked the question. The answer now? 4.4%. (4.3% not seasonally adjusted)</p>

<blockquote><p>Hoping to turn enemies into allies, U.S. forces are arming Iraqis who fought with the insurgents. But it&#8217;s already starting to backfire. A report from the front lines of the new Iraq …Now, in the midst of the surge, the Bush administration has done an about-face. Having lost the civil war, many Sunnis were suddenly desperate to switch sides — and Gen. David Petraeus was eager to oblige. The U.S. has not only added 30,000 more troops in Iraq — it has essentially bribed the opposition, arming the very Sunni militants who only months ago were waging deadly assaults on American forces. To engineer a fragile peace, the U.S. military has created and backed dozens of new Sunni militias, which now operate beyond the control of Iraq&#8217;s central government. The Americans call the units by a variety of euphemisms: Iraqi Security Volunteers (ISVs), neighborhood watch groups, Concerned Local Citizens, Critical Infrastructure Security. The militias prefer a simpler and more dramatic name: They call themselves Sahwa, or &#8220;the Awakening.&#8221; … The American forces responsible for overseeing &#8220;volunteer&#8221; militias like Osama&#8217;s have no illusions about their loyalty. &#8220;The only reason anything works or anybody deals with us is because we give them money,&#8221; says a young Army intelligence officer. The 2nd Squadron, 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, which patrols Osama&#8217;s territory, is handing out $32 million to Iraqis in the district, including $6 million to build the towering walls that, in the words of one U.S. officer, serve only to &#8220;make Iraqis more divided than they already are.&#8221; In districts like Dora, the strategy of the surge seems simple: to buy off every Iraqi in sight. All told, the U.S. is now backing more than 600,000 Iraqi men in the security sector — more than half the number Saddam had at the height of his power. With the ISVs in place, the Americans are now arming both sides in the civil war. &#8220;Iraqi solutions for Iraqi problems,&#8221; as U.S. strategists like to say. David Kilcullen, the counterinsurgency adviser to Gen. Petraeus, calls it &#8220;balancing competing armed interest groups.&#8221; But loyalty that can be purchased is by its very nature fickle. Only months ago, members of the Awakening were planting IEDs and ambushing U.S. soldiers. They were snipers and assassins, singing songs in honor of Fallujah and fighting what they viewed as a war of national liberation against the foreign occupiers. These are men the Americans described as terrorists, Saddam loyalists, dead-enders, evildoers, Baathists, insurgents. There is little doubt what will happen when the massive influx of American money stops: Unless the new Iraqi state continues to operate as a vast bribing machine, the insurgent Sunnis who have joined the new militias will likely revert to fighting the ruling Shiites, who still refuse to share power. &#8220;We are essentially supporting a quasi-feudal devolution of authority to armed enclaves, which exist at the expense of central government authority,&#8221; says Chas Freeman, who served as ambassador to Saudi Arabia under the first President Bush. &#8220;Those we are arming and training are arming and training themselves not to facilitate our objectives but to pursue their own objectives vis-a-vis other Iraqis. It means that the sectarian and ethnic conflicts that are now suppressed are likely to burst out with even greater ferocity in the future.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We have created quite the mess, which we just keep adding to.  Time to “declare victory and come home”.</p>
<p>Update: You may have heard about a new book from Dr. JosepH Stiglitz entitled <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/28891.html">The Three Trillion Dollar War</a>.  Is this what the White House thinks is an appropriate book review?</p>
<blockquote><p>The White House doesn&#8217;t care for the estimates by Stiglitz, a former chief economist of the World Bank who&#8217;s now a professor at Columbia University. &#8220;People like Joe Stiglitz lack the courage to consider the cost of doing nothing and the cost of failure. One can&#8217;t even begin to put a price tag on the cost to this nation of the attacks of 9-11,&#8221; said White House spokesman Tony Fratto, conceding that the costs of the war on terrorism are high while questioning the premise of Stiglitz&#8217;s research.</p></blockquote>
<p>Suggesting that Dr. Stiglitz lacks courage simply because he dared to present the facts is really low even for this White House.  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/02/28/stiglitz-fratto">Satyam</a> notes what Senator Schumer had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was also tremendously disappointed to read in the paper today that the White House has disparaged Prof. Stiglitz and the work he has done. It is the height of hypocrisy for an administration that has been so secretive, so unwilling to face the truth and the true costs of their policies and this war to disparage the courage and conviction of someone like Professor Stiglitz.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Making comparisons over time of how real income grows is a difficult proposition with many data problems.  One recent study was able to show how a current family&#8217;s income when they were in their thirties compared to the income of the same individuals  parents when the parents were in their thirties.  This type of intergenerational income comparisons is very unusual and can be used to show how much of income mobility is due to family or inherited factors and how much of mobility is due to general mobility in the economy. The findings of this study were generally in line with other studies that show family is a very important factor in driving income mobility and that in general economic mobility does not appear to have changed much in recent years.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8bp-phuVXI/AAAAAAAAAH0/-ZM0Qlvwfec/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8bp-phuVXI/AAAAAAAAAH0/-ZM0Qlvwfec/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />But that is not what I want to focus on.  Rather I want to focus on a couple of points that this study did not emphasize.   One is the changing nature of income growth and where family income comes from.  The first point is how real income of males and females and shown very different trends in recent decades. Since the 1970s the real income of males has been flat to down while the real income of females has risen significantly. However, it is still less then the real income of a male.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8bqUZhuVYI/AAAAAAAAAH8/9CrAZ28upJg/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8bqUZhuVYI/AAAAAAAAAH8/9CrAZ28upJg/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>This trend of flat male incomes and rising female income has combined with a major shift in female employment.  When you combine this with the major shift in the share of wifes working it becomes obvious that a major driving force behind the growth in family income shown in the first chart has been the growth in two income families.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8bqhZhuVZI/AAAAAAAAAIE/qnTaZ2Hsa2c/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8bqhZhuVZI/AAAAAAAAAIE/qnTaZ2Hsa2c/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The fundamental question is why has it become much more difficult for a current family to achieve rising family incomes then it was for the previous generation.  Obviously, the dominant long term factor driving this trend is the sharp slowing of productivity growth since the 1970s.<br />Even though productivity growth rebounded in the 1990s, the long term trend is still much lower then it was in the 1950 to 1980 era.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8bq-phuVbI/AAAAAAAAAIU/l3-o-XRCDfQ/s1600-h/Clipboard04.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8bq-phuVbI/AAAAAAAAAIU/l3-o-XRCDfQ/s320/Clipboard04.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>But the overall slowdown in the growth of family income has been significant, from a trend growth rate of 2.3% to a trend of 1.3%.  If the old trend had continued real family income<br />would now be 50% higher.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8br75huVcI/AAAAAAAAAIc/-umgtdVNfBM/s1600-h/Clipboard05.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8br75huVcI/AAAAAAAAAIc/-umgtdVNfBM/s320/Clipboard05.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The other point that the chart demonstrates is that the growth in real family income has become much more cyclical in recent times.  In the 1950-75 era, cyclical weakness in real income growth was minor and quickly reversed.  But since 1975 the cyclical weakness in family income has been much more severe and prolonged.  Moreover, the pronounced change in the cyclical pattern raises questions that the weaker trend since the late 1970s may be due to other factors on top on weak productivity&#8211;for example higher oil prices and a general deterioration in the US terms of trade.</p>

<p>Both Senator Clinton and Senator Obama are telling voters in Ohio that they would change NAFTA.  I’m sure with the unemployment rate at 6 percent, workers in Ohio are upset. But is NAFTA the cause of the economic woes in Ohio?  I’ve drawn a graph of the state’s unemployment rate from 1993 through 2007 as a way of beginning this discussion.  First observation: the unemployment rate in Ohio declined after NAFTA was passed.  OK, the national unemployment rate declined during the 1990’s boom.  But the subsequent rise in Ohio’s unemployment rate coincided with a rise in the nation’s unemployment rate.  </p>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/02/stagnant-wages.html">Brad DeLong</a> points us to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/business/27leonhardt.html?_r=2&#038;hp=&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;oref=slogin">David Leonhardt</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first problem with what the candidates have been saying is that Ohio’s troubles haven’t really been caused by trade agreements. When Nafta took effect on Jan. 1, 1994, Ohio had 990,000 manufacturing jobs. Two years later, it had 1.03 million. The number remained above one million for the rest of the 1990s, before plummeting in this decade to just 775,000 today. It’s hard to look at this history and conclude Nafta is the villain. In fact, Nafta did little to reduce tariffs on Mexican manufacturers, notes Matthew Slaughter, a Dartmouth economist. Those tariffs were already low before the agreement was signed.  A more important cause of Ohio’s jobs exodus is the rise of China, India and the old Soviet bloc, which has brought hundreds of millions of workers into the global economy. New technology and better transportation have then made it easier for jobs to be done in those places and elsewhere. To put it in concrete terms, your credit card’s customer service center isn’t in Ireland because of a new trade deal.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it’s not just job losses that matter.  If one loses a high paying job only to take another job with lower pay, that will not show up in the unemployment statistics but it will mean one’s real wages have suffered.  But is this from trade with Mexico or is this from the rise in imports from the rest of the world?  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/02/nafta-isnt-the.html">Mark Thoma</a> weighs in:</p>
<blockquote><p>if you go along with the idea that we should use social insurance programs to protect workers but not jobs, then this gives a means of evaluating candidate&#8217;s trade proposals that doesn&#8217;t depend upon whether the changes are driven by technology, globalization, or some other shock. To what extent does a particular proposal protect jobs and hence inhibit needed flexibility of the labor market? To what extent do the proposals compensate for job flexibility and the insecurity that comes along with it by protecting workers who have been displaced? Do the proposals cause firms to fully internalize the costs of their employment decisions? What types of incentives are built into worker protection programs, i.e. do workers still retain the incentive to seek out and accept new employment? Workers in Ohio and elsewhere are feeling the effects of something &#8211; I think the story above is basically correct but does not place enough emphasis on technological innovation as a cause of recent labor displacing change &#8211; but debate over the cause of their troubles shouldn&#8217;t delay the implementation of policies that could help now.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is very well said!  But let’s go back to Mr. Leonhardt’s very interesting discussion:</p>
<blockquote><p>But when you read this plan, or Mr. Obama’s trade agenda, you discover none of it is particularly radical. Neither candidate calls for a repeal of Nafta, or anything close to it. Both instead want to tinker with the bureaucratic innards of the agreement. They want stronger “labor and environmental standards” and better “enforcement mechanisms.”  It’s a bit of an odd situation. They call the country’s trade policy a disaster, and yet their plan to fix it starts with, um, cracking down on Mexican pollution. The question this raises is what Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton would really do about Ohio’s troubles if one of them became president — and whether it would make a difference … Here, finally, is where we get to the good news about the Ohio campaign. Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton favor all these ideas. They both want to invest in infrastructure, science and alternative energy, and they both want to cut taxes for everyone but the affluent. Mr. Obama, in particular, has proposed a cut in payroll taxes, perhaps the most regressive part of the tax code.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/180519.php">David Kurtz</a> point us to <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080227/dems_nafta_080227/20080227?hub=CTVNewsAt11">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Within the last month, a top staff member for Obama&#8217;s campaign telephoned Michael Wilson, Canada&#8217;s ambassador to the United States, and warned him that Obama would speak out against NAFTA, according to Canadian sources. The staff member reassured Wilson that the criticisms would only be campaign rhetoric, and should not be taken at face value. But Tuesday night in Ohio, where NAFTA is blamed for massive job losses, Obama said he would tell Canada and Mexico &#8220;that we will opt out unless we renegotiate the core labour and environmental standards.&#8221;  Late Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Obama campaign said the staff member&#8217;s warning to Wilson sounded implausible, but did not deny that contact had been made. &#8220;Senator Obama does not make promises he doesn&#8217;t intend to keep,&#8221; the spokesperson said. Low-level sources also suggested the Clinton campaign may have given a similar warning to Ottawa, but a Clinton spokesperson flatly denied the claim.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those on the right would have us believe that Obama is a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/dangerous-protectionism-of-barack-obama.html">dangerous protectionist</a>.  Maybe he won’t be as President.  And maybe he’ll take seriously the list of very good ideas to address Ohio’s economic woes – at least more seriously than this current Administration.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mexico and Canada on Wednesday voiced concern about calls by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, as the Democratic presidential hopefuls compete to adopt the most sceptical stance towards free trade ahead of next week’s Ohio primary election.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Democrats cannot simultaneously talk about improving America&#8217;s standing abroad while acting like a belligerent unilateralist when it comes to trade policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Daniel goes onto to say that Clinton and Obama are not “out-and-out protectionists”.  Let’s hope not.  But I have to wonder if Lou Dobbs is elated that the Mexican government is upset.  And there are a few members of the Republican Party who seemingly love to attack our neighbors as well.  This Democrat, however, would hope my party leaders avoid such bad habits in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>:  Things have gotten childish between Clinton and Obama.   A union supporting <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/usnw/20080228/pl_usnw/obama_telegraphs_pro_nafta_position">Senator Clinton</a> is now attacking Obama for the following reason:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a report on CTV Television Network, a senior member of Sen. Barack Obamas (D-IL) campaign staff contacted Canada’s ambassador to the U.S. earlier this month and warned him that the senator would be taking strong positions against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but that it was only campaign rhetoric and should not be taken seriously. I am appalled but not surprised by this report, said IAM International President Tom Buffenbarger. Working families cannot trust a candidate who telegraphs his real position to a foreign government and then dissembles in a nationally televised debate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though the <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0208/Canadians_deny_Obama_call.html">Canadian government</a> denies that there was such a contact.  </p>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/02/hillarybacking_union_chief_hit.php">Greg Sargent</a> who notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>it&#8217;s worth keeping in mind that Buffenbarger apparently has little difficulty speaking his mind when it comes to Obama. He recently denounced Obama supporters as &#8220;latte-drinking, Prius- driving, Birkenstock-wearing, trust fund babies&#8221; and said that Obama wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;last a round against the Republican attack machine.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Fellows?!  You’re giving the Republican attack machine a loaded gun.</p>

<p>I know that I will be accused of being dogmatic, partisan and attacking the capitalist religion. However:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. The risk of loss (moral hazard) is a factor both in the market and criminal spheres. The greater the reward for inappropriate action, the greater the risk that someone will indulge in such action.</p>
<p>2. CEO compensation packages and bonuses (as well as those for many of the top executives) have increased to such an extent that it has greatly increased the reward for undertaking actions that are unethical or illegal in order to recoup the reward. This is enhanced by golden parachute packages that ensure financial security even if the individual is fired.</p>
<p>3. The types of actions that are taken by these individuals and their subordinates often causes losses to the corporation and to society far in excess of the reward gained by the individual participant.</p>
<p>4. Business tends to be amoral. This creates an attitude the ignores broader societal concerns and social imperatives. This culminates in an attitude of &#8220;nothing personal, it is just business..&#8221; This may be good for corporate profits. It is not necessarily good for the needs of society in general.</p>
<p>5. The amoral nature of business leads to an attitude of stretching the law or regulations to the greatest extent possible. The results in two significant problems. First, as incentives grow, the tendency to step over the line grows. This is especially so in an environment when the complexity of the law results in an inherent advantage to large companies that can afford protracted litigation. Second, transactional costs for all business grows significantly when greater oversight and laundry lists of rule must be developed to combat illegal activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not a rant against capitalism. I was part of a large aerospace company as senior counsel with responsibility for managing D&#038;O liability, government contracts, EH&#038;S, corporate security, ITAR and other such areas. Competition and innovative thought did a lot of good. However, I also saw a lot of damage done (especially those who could really boost their bonus) by gaming the system. The corporation often fought against regulation and &#8220;doing the right thing&#8221; while many times spending significant amount to face grand juries, fight civil suits and otherwise make up for the stretching of the law or ethics by that person who was going after that extra $100k bonus. We, who had to clean up, usually spent much more.</p>
<p>It is, as usual, a matter of balance. The atmosphere that brought Enron and the other scandals of that era bespoke too much laxity in regulation and a lack of moral and ethical values on the part of too many corporate executives. The current scandals involving no bid contracts and fraud in Iraq bespeaks of too cozy an arrangement between government officials and corporations. It just needs to be brought back into balance.</p>
<p>I have retired and own my own business now. I have had to get on some of my employees for being to accommodating to our customers. You have to remind them that we were in business to make money and not just to be nice. I am sick and tired of the attitude of some conservatives that the free market must be totally unregulated as well as used to tackle all problems. No market is free. Even Adam Smith knew that certain problems were not susceptible to resolution by markets. Not all capitalists are evil and the government cannot intervene and solve all problems. We would accomplish far more if we recognized the good and bad in each approach and work towards practical resolutions.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I&#8217;m curious about funds of funds &#8211; that is, hedge funds whose primary investment is other hedge funds.  (Full disclosure &#8211; yes, this is for a current project, and yes, I have data, but its proprietary and I&#8217;m not allowed to share, though perhaps some of the results may be shareable at some later point.)</p>
<p>I understand that most hedge funds don&#8217;t actually beat the market, but a few of them do manage to do so systematically.  Presumably, some hedge fund managers really do have some skills and/or knowledge that is &#8220;above and beyond.&#8221; </p>
<p>Presumably, we would see something similar among funds of funds, after a while.  Sure, there is the added problem of the dual layer of fees (there are fees for the hedge funds, and then fees for the fund of funds), but perhaps that can be gotten around.  (A fund of funds might, due to its assets and connections, be able to negotiate fees for the hedge funds in which it invests down.  It might also be able to keep its own fees down, in part by hiring outsiders &#8211; say, for example, a  number cruncher &#8211; to act as consultants on a specific task instead of retaining that expertise in-house in a place like Westchester or NYC or Bermuda.)  </p>
<p>So here are some questions&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>1.  Do we see successful fund of funds?  Is there any specific behavior that works well?<br />2.  What are the things a fund of fund should look for among the funds in which it might potentially choose to invest.  Obviously, it would want funds that perform well over time (how long?), have relatively low volatility, and whose performance (and style and investment strategy) are uncorrelated with each other, so that if the doo-doo hits the proverbial fan with one or two of the underlying investments, it won&#8217;t hit it for all of them.<br />3.  Can you determine if a given style or approach is going to stop working?  For example, a fund that invested in real estate would probably have done very well from about 1998 until recently.  I believe many funds (I assume the small ones?) make money mostly by writing options which rarely get cashed.  <br />4.  How far back should one look?  Is data from 1975 really relevant?  What about 1989?<br />5.  What am I not asking?</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks.</p>
