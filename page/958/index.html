                                <p>This is my first post&#8230; I apologize for any formatting errors&#8230;.</p>
<p>Tax reduction seems to be a signature policy of the GW administration, and there has been time to see how well it has worked (or not). Despite the rising chorus, the data just doesn’t seem to be cooperating with the administration or its supporters – real tax collections in 2005 were less than in 2000 <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/%3Ca">according to the Office of Management and Budget</a>, despite a growing economy and population. Before this administration took office, you would have had to go back to the Reagan administration’s tax cutting experiment to find a time when real tax collections were less than they had been five years earlier. One would think that would make it tough to argue that the tax cuts are “working”, but regular Angry Bear readers are treated to a periodic skewering of National Review who insist on trying anyway.</p>
<p>Another way to look at the tax issue is by comparing tax rates and economic performance across jurisdictions. Each of the fifty states has its own tax policies. If the tax cut crowd is correct, states with lower taxes should grow faster than states with higher taxes, for two reasons. The first is that the low taxes leave more money in people’s pockets, giving them more to spend and invest. The second is that people will vote with their feet, as per the Tiebout hypothesis.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/%3Ca">BEA website</a> reports real gross state product from 1990 to 2005. Combined state and local tax burden for each state from 1970 to 2006 is available from the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/%3Ca">Tax Foundation</a>. Because the Tax Foundation has impeccable credentials among the tax-cutting crowd, use of its data should be kosher for them.</p>
<p>The correlation between each state’s percentage change in Gross State Product and its tax burden for every year from 1991 to 2005 can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>minimum&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;-64.2%<br />25th percentile&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-24.9%<br />median&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.8.4%<br />75th percentile&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..27.0%<br />maximum&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..73.3%</p>
<p>average&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. 0.7%</p>
<p>What this means is that the state with the lowest correlation between its percentage change in GSP and its tax burden has a correlation of –64.2%, the state with the highest such correlation shows a correlation of 73.3%. A negative correlation indicates that higher taxes are associated with slower growth rates, and a positive correlation indicates that higher taxes are associated with higher growth rates. Half of states fit into the interquartile range, with correlations between –24.9% and 27%. Additionally, the median correlation is 8.4% and the average is 0.7%. This first pass doesn’t seem to indicate much of a relationship between tax burdens and growth rates, and, if anything, since both the median and average correlations are positive, in at least half the states, lower tax burdens are associated with lower, not higher growth rates.</p>
<p>However… perhaps this isn’t true of states with high growth rates? Is it possible the fast growing states have discovered something about tax burdens that other states have not? Or perhaps the slow growth states are missing something obvious? The table below shows the same statistics for the states that have grown the fastest from 1990 to 2005, and for the states that have grown the slowest over the same period:</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;5 fastest growing&#8230;&#8230;.5 slowest growing<br />minimum&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..-25.1%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-64.2%<br />25th percentile&#8230;&#8230;-18.3%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-54.7%<br />median &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..19.2%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-24.6%<br />75th percentile&#8230;&#8230;.30.4%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..28.9%<br />maximum&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.35.7%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..43.4%</p>
<p>average&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;8.4%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-14.2%</p>
<p>On average, for fast growing states, there is a more positive correlation between growth rates and tax burdens than for states in general. Conversely, for the slow growing states, there actually is the negative correlation between tax burdens and growth rates that the tax-cutting crowd would have predicted for all states.</p>
<p>But maybe it takes time for tax cuts to work their magic? After all, people don’t decide to start a business or relocate overnight… A summary of the correlation between growth rates and tax burdens in the previous year is shown below:</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..all states&#8230;&#8230;.5 fast growing&#8230;&#8230;.5 slow growing<br />minimum&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..-63.8%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..-19.3%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-63.8%<br />25th percentile.-15.5%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..-15.4%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-54.0%<br />median&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.11.6%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;18.3%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-28.0%<br />75th percentile&#8230;..32.7%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;21.7%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..34.3%<br />maximum&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.65.3%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;65.3%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..54.9%</p>
<p>average&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..5.5%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.14.1%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;-11.3%</p>
<p>Hmmm… perhaps not. Similar relationships persist lagging tax burdens by 2 years, 3 yeas, 5 years, 10 years and 20 years (beyond that I got bored), though, if anything, the average correlation between growth rates and lagged tax burdens has a slight tendency to increase as the lag length increases.</p>
<p>Thus, the data doesn’t seem to support the idea that lower taxes are associated with faster growth rates. In fact, the opposite is true, especially for the fastest growing states. One way to interpret this is to conclude that taxes are actually below their optimal rates, and therefore, at the margin, the government is actually more efficient than individuals at converting its spending into growth. Society needs a certain amount of public goods (infrastructure, public health, confronting the Canadian menace, etc.) for businesses to thrive, and perhaps we currently have too little provision of public goods rather than too much.</p>

                                <p>asks <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w9202">Dirk Krueger and Fabrizio Perri</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This paper first documents the evolution of the cross-sectional income and consumption distribution in the US in the past 25 years. Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey we find that a rising income inequality has not been accompanied by a corresponding rise in consumption inequality. Over the period from 1972 to 1998 the standard deviation of the log of after-tax labor income has increased by 20% while the standard deviation of log consumption has increased less than 2%. Furthermore income inequality has increased both between and within education groups while consumption inequality has increased between education groups but mildly declined within groups. We then argue that these empirical findings are consistent with the hypothesis that an increase in income volatility has been an important cause of the increase in income inequality, but at the same time has lead to an endogenous development of credit markets, allowing households to better smooth their consumption against idiosyncratic income fluctuations.</p></blockquote>
<p>My thanks to the many comments following <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/income-inequality-misrepresenting.html">this post</a>, which criticized a claim from <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YWZlMTAxZGNjZjViMDFkZDJlNDVmNTBkMGVjOTUyNzQ=">John Hood</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Other evidence persuasively suggests that measuring household consumption, not income, is the best way to gauge living standards</p></blockquote>
<p>One AB reader also pointed out <a href="http://fmwww.bc.edu/EC-P/WP629.pdf">Household Debt and Income Inequality, 1963-2003</a> by Matteo Iacoviello, which argues that the observed rise in household debt relative to income over the past 30 years is attributable to rising income inequality.  Iacoviello’s model predicts that consumption inequality grows less than proportionally as income inequality grows, while wealth inequality grows more than proportionally.  </p>
<p>Examining the distribution of current consumption misses the point that living standards should be gauged across individual’s lifetimes.  While the very wealthy have ample resources for old age retirement, the evidence suggests that the working poor may not – unless we retain the Social Security Trust Fund as a vehicle to supplement their retirement benefits.  Rightwingers like John Hood, however, are advocating that the government substantially reduce Social Security benefits.  Go figure.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/2006-08-02-deficit-usat_x.htm">Dennis Cauchon</a> dusts off accrual accounting to scare the readers of USA Today:<br />
<blockquote>The set the government promotes to the public has a healthier bottom line: a $318 billion deficit in 2005. The set the government doesn&#8217;t talk about is the audited financial statement produced by the government&#8217;s accountants following standard accounting rules. It reports a more ominous financial picture: a $760 billion deficit for 2005. If Social Security and Medicare were included &#8211; as the board that sets accounting rules is considering &#8211; the federal deficit would have been $3.5 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jol/vol41_1/garrett.php">Elizabeth Garrett</a> provides a nice description of accrual accounting for the Federal government in her discussion of Howell E. Jackson’s Accounting for Social Security and Its Reform (2004):<br />
<blockquote>Social Security, the largest entitlement program in the federal government, is now accounted for on a cash-flow basis; its financial reports subtract the amount of benefits paid to retirees from the annual cash receipts from payroll taxes paid by workers. In cash-flow terms, the system is in surplus because it currently takes in billions of dollars more each year than it pays out. But the cash-flow method obscures the serious challenges that Social Security faces in the future as the Baby Boom generation continues to retire and fewer workers pay the taxes necessary to sustain this pay-as-you-go system. As Professor Jackson reveals, the unfunded accrued liabilities in the Social Security trust funds at the end of fiscal year 2002 were $12.6 trillion, or 122% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the problem with this 122% of today’s GDP is that she is referring to the present value of expected future cash flows over a very long period of time.  If one takes the present value of GDP over a similar period, it’s likely close to $1000 trillion so the alleged long-run shortfall is only 1.3% of the present value of future GDP.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/08/the_longterm_deficit_trap.html#005626">Dean Baker</a> read this USA Today story and writes:<br />
<blockquote>Be warned – this is not a story about the evils of Bush’s tax cuts for the rich. These tax cuts are just a footnote. The real villain in the bankruptcy story is the projected explosion in the cost of Medicare and Medicaid. This cost explosion is not due to aging; Social Security costs inch up in these projections – just like they have been doing for the past seventy years. Medicare and Medicaid costs explode in this story because the U.S. health care system is broken and the projections assume that we never fix it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah projections – the key to any present value or discounted cash flow model!  Yes if we assume that Bush’s tax cuts are made permanent and we also assume an explosion in Federal funding of a bloated health care system, the Federal finances look bleak.  But what would one expect from a model that assumes future President’s are as fiscally reckless as the current one?  </p>

                                                                    </div>

<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, wages for the lowest paid workers have stagnated. But minimum wage increases merely treat the symptoms. Rather than blaming companies for paying workers too little, politicians might focus on the mediocre public schools that leave young workers inadequately prepared for the workforce. The problem is more likely due to the lack of competition faced by public schools than the intense competition between firms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, I see – he’s just making an argument for privatized education.  And his evidence that privatization of education would raise income of workers is – he presents no evidence.  But then his op-ed has to address the minimum wage issue at some point:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even among low skilled workers, it is the least skilled, poorest workers who are the most likely to lose their jobs because of a higher minimum wage. The point of all these examples is simple: if shovels cost more, people buy fewer shovels. Economists call it the “Law of Demand” for a reason. Higher priced shovels mean that some firms will replace them with something else. And there are other consequences. Professors David Newmark at UC Irvine and Olena Nizalova at Michigan State found that a higher minimum wage reduces how much firms invest in training young workers, and results in lower wages for these workers when they get older.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again  a claim – that being minimum wage laws create unemployment – is made sine evidence.  Olena Nizalova turns out to be a Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State whose dissertation includes an essay with David Neumark entitled “Minimum Wages in the Longer Run” where the summary reads: </p>
<blockquote><p>Exposure to minimum wages at young ages may lead to longer-run effects. Among the possible adverse longer-run effects are decreased labor market experience and accumulation of tenure, lower current labor supply because of lower wages, and diminished training and skill acquisition. Beneficial longer-run effects could arise if minimum wages increase skill acquisition, or if short-term wage increases are long-lasting. We estimate the longer-run effects of minimum wages by using information on the minimum wage history that workers have faced since potentially entering the labor market. The evidence indicates that even as individuals reach their late 20&#8217;s, they work less and earn less the longer they were exposed to a higher minimum wage, especially as a teenager. The adverse longer-run effects of facing high minimum wages as a teenager are stronger for blacks. From a policy perspective, these longer-run effects of minimum wages are likely more significant than the contemporaneous effects of minimum wages on youths that are the focus of most research and policy debate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lott cannot even bother to spell the name of the <a href="http://www.msu.edu/user/neumarkd/neumark3.html">coauthor</a> correctly.  And his characterization of their research seems to differ a bit from Nizalova’s summary.  Does anyone have access to this essay so we could review their analysis for ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Many thanks to AB reader Stormy both for a link to the <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w10656">NBER</a> abstract of their working paper and to a very interesting paper by <a href="http://www.bankisrael.gov.il/deptdata/mehkar/papers/dp0513e.pdf">Amit Friedman</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: The state of <a href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/minwage/america.htm#Washington">Washington</a> has a minimum wage equal to $7.63 per hour.  Its reported unemployment rate has hovered between 4.6% and 5.1% this year- roughly consistent with the national unemployment rate.</p>
<p>Today’s story by <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003174220_puyallupfair04m.html">Charlotte Hsu</a> was offered up by some troll as evidence that higher minimum wages lead to unemployment but here are the key passages of this story:<br />
<blockquote>State workers who help applicants meet potential employers sat idle, typing on laptops or staring out the trailer door. Employers are seeking 3,000 fair workers through the state employment agency WorkSource, which staffed the trailer Thursday. That&#8217;s double the number the agency sought last year, reflecting vendors&#8217; inability this year to fill slots on their own, said Karen LaFlamme, fair spokeswoman. The fair&#8217;s problems mirror a statewide trend. A Washington Employment Security Department survey of more than 15,000 businesses statewide showed an estimated 81,500 jobs vacant in April. That&#8217;s 11,000 more than a year earlier and the largest number of openings in the survey&#8217;s four-year history. Evelina Tainer, a chief economist at the department, said few workers are willing to take temporary jobs like those at next month&#8217;s fair when higher-paying, permanent positions are open across the state &#8230; Still, for many around the state, work is about money. So the fair, where many jobs pay minimum wage, $7.63 an hour, is having trouble competing this year with a strong economy. Beverly Burback, a part owner of Funtastic Games and Rides, says she will need 1,000 employees in Puyallup. Finding them may be difficult.</p></blockquote>
<p>As AB reader Bruce Webb notes, this story suggests that market wages in this area exceed Washington’s minimum wage.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>An <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/08/03/minimumwage.ap/index.html">AP story</a> on the fine print behind the GOP’s alleged concern for workers earning the minimum wage reports:<br />
<blockquote>Nevada, California and Washington are among seven states where workers get to keep their tips on top of getting paid their state&#8217;s full minimum wage. In other states, tip-earning workers get paid less and make up the difference with tips. A provision in GOP-written minimum wage legislation passed by the House and under consideration this week by the Senate could change the law in those seven states &#8212; the others are Montana, Alaska, Minnesota and Oregon. It would deal a pay cut of $3 or more an hour to thousands of waiters, bellhops and hairdressers in those states, according to Democrats and labor groups. &#8220;Everything that has been achieved in seven states to support low-wage workers who earn tips is destroyed by this bill,&#8221; said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. &#8220;This bill would slash the salaries of thousands of workers.&#8221; Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called the provision a &#8220;travesty.&#8221; Republicans and the National Restaurant Association, which opposes a minimum wage increase and fought for the tip provision, dispute the Democratic interpretation. They say the legislation is only intended to have an impact when the states in question increase their minimum wage &#8212; at which point the increase would come out of a worker&#8217;s tips, not an employer&#8217;s payroll. &#8220;No provision results in the lowering of wages for any worker. The purpose of the provision is to allow employers with tipped employees to count their employees&#8217; tips as wages for purposes of meeting their minimum wage obligation,&#8221; Brendan Flanagan, a spokesman for the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement Tuesday after Democrats began raising concerns. A memo by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service on Wednesday backed up the Democratic position. Under the bill language, the seven affected states &#8220;would seem to be prohibited from enforcing the minimum wage rate provisions of their laws with respect to a tipped employee&#8221; said the memo, written by Jon A. Shimabukuro, a legislative attorney at the research service, for Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would seem that with anything coming from this Republican controlled Congress, one really needs to read the fine print.  Yes, the National Restaurant Association wants to win in Washington, D.C. what it lost in the state legislatures.  I guess when these Republicans have to choose between state rights and giving perks to their base, the base wins out over principles every time.</p>

<blockquote>British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger &#8211; in an apparent end run around a Bush administration that has stubbornly resisted addressing global warming &#8211; signed a partnership Monday to share technology and scientific research aimed at fighting the effects of worldwide climate change.</p></blockquote>
<p>So he claims the Constitution said:<br />
<blockquote>No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, &#8230; enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power</p></blockquote>
<p>The relevant passage from <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec10.html">Article I, section 10</a> is:<br />
<blockquote>No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did Mr. Murray’s selective editing change the meaning of this passage?  Perhaps not if one thinks addressing global warming is a declarative or war on the United States.  Such is the nature of the (lack of) understanding our Constitution when one views it from the perspective of the wingnuts at the National Review. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2006/8/2/134832/8334">David Roberts</a> blogs about Congress and global warming catching this:<br />
<blockquote>Former U.S. EPA Administrator Carol Browner predicted in an interview that Congress would act on climate next year if the Supreme Court rules next term that EPA has authority to regulate the most predominant greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, under the Clean Air Act. &#8220;The last thing Congress wants, Democrat or Republican, is for EPA to set the standards,&#8221; Browner said. But Barton sees a Supreme Court ruling spurring lawmakers to move in the opposite direction. &#8220;I cannot imagine any objective finding that CO2 is a pollutant,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If that&#8217;s true, God is a polluter.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you just see it now – our Supreme Court ruling that the Federal government has the right to tell God to cease pollution?  Scalia would certainly dissent!</p>

                                <p>Robert “no relation to Paul” Samuelson gets one thing right in his discussion of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/02/AR2006080201387.html">the poverty rate</a>: <br />
<blockquote>The economic boom of the 1990s explains much of this improvement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s review the historical record.  From 1963 (the year that Johnson succeeded Kennedy) to 1996 (the year that the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act became law), the poverty rate fell from 19.5% to 13.7%.  The overall decline had various phases.  In 1978, the poverty rate was only 11.4%.  The twin recessions – one during Carter’s latter years in office and one during Reagan’s first term – led to a 15.2% poverty rate in 1983 but we did manage to see poverty decline to 12.8% before the Bush41 recession.  </p>
<p>Mr. Samuelson’s quote here relates to the fact that the poverty rate fell to 11.3% during the Clinton boom but was 12.7% in part because of the weak economy during Bush43’s first term in office.  So he’s right – business cycles affect the poverty rate.  But that’s not his message:<br />
<blockquote>President Bill Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, better known as &#8220;welfare reform,&#8221; on Aug. 22 of that year. A decade later it stands as a rarity: a Washington success story. It did not succeed in the utopian sense of eliminating all poverty or family breakdown. It succeeded in a more practical way. It improved life modestly for millions of people and showed that government could orchestrate constructive change.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our review of the big picture begs the question to what evidence would lead to this conclusion.  While Mr. Samuelson looks at certain details, <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002398.html">Max Sawicky</a> writes:<br />
<blockquote>Two can play at this game. And I can play it better than Not-Paul, because I&#8217;m not full of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll stop there as one should read Max’s excellent rebuttal.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YWZlMTAxZGNjZjViMDFkZDJlNDVmNTBkMGVjOTUyNzQ=">John Hood</a> is accusing the <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/7-10-06inc.htm">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a> of “pounding the redistribution drum, again”.  Figure 1 from the CBPP discussion diagrams the updated version of the data series on U.S. income inequality provided by Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez (original publication being “Income Inequality in the United States:  1913-1998,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, February 2003).  The CBPP discussion states:<br />
<blockquote>The Piketty and Saez data offer the first real snapshot of income trends among those at the pinnacle of the income spectrum in 2004.  The data show that income gains between 2003 and 2004 were particularly large for those at the very top of the income spectrum, resulting in a nearly unprecedented one-year increase in income concentration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hood tries to suggest that <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/07/new-data-on-income-inequality.html">Greg Mankiw</a> disagreed with this statement when he said:<br />
<blockquote>After rising substantially from 1986 to 2000, income inequality is essentially the same in 2004 (the most recent year of data) as it was in 2000.</p></blockquote>
<p>It turns out that there was a temporary dip in the share of income captured by the very rich followed by a subsequent jump from 2003 to 2004 that offset this dip.  For a nice summary of the debate, see <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/07/income_inequali.html">Mark Thoma</a> who adds:<br />
<blockquote>The little dip at the end is what the fuss is all about. But even if Greg&#8217;s claim holds up to the types of qualifications Brad talks about, and there are good reasons to worry about using 2000 as a base year, the upward trend in income inequality since the 1970s is undeniable. And in any case, as the last graph shows, real income for the bottom 99% of the distribution has been flat since the early 1970s despite large gains in productivity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that the long-run trend in this data is stacked against the bogus argument Hood is trying to put forth, he decides to continue with:<br />
<blockquote>Seriously, these analyses based on income reported to the Internal Revenue Service are fruits from a poisoned tree. Surely there is no need to explain why various individuals, rich and not-so-rich, may not fully report their true economic condition to the taxman.</p></blockquote>
<p>Never mind the fact that the National Revenue crowd has used this same IRS data when they could spin it to suit their purposes – which of course means Hood next has to change the metric entirely:<br />
<blockquote>Other evidence persuasively suggests that measuring household consumption, not income, is the best way to gauge living standards and eliminate biases related to tax sheltering, the underground economy, temporary gains or losses, and other issues.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What evidence?</strong>  Some spin from <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg1791.cfm">Robert Rector and Rea Hederman</a> of the Heritage Foundation and <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/AlanReynolds/2006/03/30/yes,_a_rising_tide">Alan Reynolds</a> with the latter stating:<br />
<blockquote>The broadest measure of living standards is what consumers spend. Real consumption per person rose from $14,816 in 1980 (in 2000 dollars) to $25,816 in 2004 &#8211; an unprecedented gain of 74.2 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>To which Hood claims:<br />
<blockquote>measuring household consumption, not income, is the best way to gauge living standards and eliminate biases related to tax sheltering, the underground economy, temporary gains or losses, and other issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>But notice that Mr. Reynolds was talking about the mean level of consumption per household and not the distribution of consumption across the spectrum from what Paris Hilton consumes versus what the fellow receiving the minimum wage consumes.  And even that comparison can be misleading as I’m sure that the very rich will have plenty of savings to live off of during retirement – whereas the family living paycheck to paycheck will have very little outside their Social Security benefits – which of course, the National Review crowd would take away so as to fund those tax cuts for the wealthy.</p>

<blockquote>GREEN: Symbolically it&#8217;s a good idea, because they hit us there, and let the world come together there. But I disagree on Bush and protecting New York. It was eight years between the first and the second World Trade Center attacks. As a New Yorker who saw the plane go into the World Trade Center on the day I had an election &#8212; of course I&#8217;m relieved there&#8217;s no attack, but for one day &#8212; for four days of the Iraq war, we can inspect not 5 percent of all containers coming into this city, but 20 percent. We could protect every airliner with antimissile devices. So since terrorism around the world has tripled, I&#8217;m not satisfied, oh, we haven&#8217;t been hit in New York. The war in Iraq has increased terrorism, isolated America. We&#8217;re spending it in the wrong place.<br />McFARLAND: Well, now, wait a minute.<br />MATTHEWS: Who was president from &#8217;93 to 2001? Who was president of the United States?<br />GREEN: You know the answer.<br />MATTHEWS: Bill Clinton. Do you think he did a good job of stopping a second attack on the World Trade Center when he was president for eight years?<br />GREEN: We can&#8217;t know whether he stopped it. Richard Clarke &#8212;<br />MATTHEWS: We know he didn&#8217;t stop it.<br />GREEN: Richard Clarke&#8217;s book said that Clinton was on the case on terrorism. Sandy Berger said, when he briefed Condoleezza Rice, he said your number one issue will be terrorism &#8211;<br />McFARLAND: Tell that to 2,000 people who died.</p></blockquote>
<p>We know that NBER dates the last recession as beginning in March 2001.  My understanding is that George W. Bush took office on January 20, 2001 so all those claims that the recession began before Bush took office make no sense according to my calendar.  But maybe my calendar is off a bit.  The only way this rant from Chris Matthews makes any sense would be for George W. Bush to have taken the oath of office on September 20, 2001.</p>
