                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MTMyYmM4YTliNTg1NzAxMWIyMGQ0ZmViYmU5MTQ1NjE=">National Review</a> wants to 86 California’s Proposition 82, which they note is a a June 6 ballot referendum seeking to create a statewide universal-preschool program:<br />
<blockquote>Proposition 82 proposes that California provide free preschool for any four-year-old whose parents request it. This generosity is expected to cost over $2 billion per year, to be extracted through an income-tax hike on individuals making over $400,000 annually … Around 65 percent of California’s four-year-olds already attend preschool. The goal of Proposition 82 is to enroll 70 percent of the state’s four-year-olds in the public-preschool program, while an additional 10 percent or so would attend private preschools. So why the huge cost for such a marginal increase in enrollment? Part of the reason is that Proposition 82 is not at all targeted to help those most in need. In fact, the plan is the opposite of targeted: It is blind, bloated, and indiscriminate. According to a study done by California’s former legislative analyst William Hamm, now a managing director with the independent consulting firm LECG, 75 percent of the massive universal-preschool budget would go to families who would send their children to preschool anyway, without the help of the program. Almost 25 percent of the program’s funding—more than $500 million—would subsidize families making over $100,000 a year. Only 8.4 percent of the budget would be spent on high-risk children who otherwise wouldn’t attend preschool. So Proposition 82 would create a massive state bureaucracy to provide a universal service that the vast majority of affected Californians already can—and already do—provide for themselves. Even if you saw nothing intrinsically wrong with targeting a tiny segment of private citizens for a $2 billion earned-income tax hit, this is a fiscal boondoggle. On top of its wastefulness, Proposition 82 would create a set of expensive and nonsensical requirements for California’s preschool teachers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Odd – William Hamm did not say this program was wasteful.  In fact, he has not said whether he was in favor of it or against it.  The folks at <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG349.1">RAND</a> argue:<br />
<blockquote>There is increased interest in California and other states in providing universal access to publicly funded high-quality preschool education for one or two years prior to kindergarten entry. In considering such a program, policymakers and the public focus on the potential benefits from a universal preschool program, as well as the estimated costs. This study aims to inform such deliberations by conducting an analysis of the economic returns from investing in preschool education in the state of California. The benefit-cost analysis undertaken in this study indicates that there can be positive returns for California society from investing in a one-year high-quality universal preschool program. The authors’ baseline estimate, which is arguably conservative, is that every dollar invested by the public sector beyond current spending will generate $2.62 in returns.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m glad the National Review is not disputing the benefits from preschool education and I welcome the debate as to how best to fund it.  After all – our governor pretends we can have better education without raising taxes.</p>

                                <p>President Bush did not pick <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/homer-simpson-for-treasury-secretary.html">my candidate</a>.  He did pick <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/30/news/economy/snow_replacement/index.htm?cnn=yes">Henry Paulson</a>: <br />
<blockquote>There had been speculation in the press, including a Saturday report in the New York Times, that Paulson wasn&#8217;t interested in taking the job because of the limited role that Snow and his predecessor, Paul O&#8217;Neill, had in shaping administration policy &#8230; &#8220;I think getting Paulson is a bit of a coup for the Bush administration,&#8221; said Jeoff Hall, the chief U.S. economist for Thomson Financial. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got enough academics at the Fed right now. You need someone with a little Wall Street credibility.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Paulson’s credibility will be destroyed if his only role is to sell the false notion that we can have permanent tax cuts without massively reducing Federal spending.  I hope Paulson will have a substantive policy role and that he pushes for fiscal sanity.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: Just as I was posting, the President came out to introduce Mr. Paulson and to thank Dr. Snow – with the latter continuing to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/05/20060530.html">prostitute</a> himself:<br />
<blockquote>That surge in government receipts, along with the strict control on spending that you&#8217;ve advocated, are putting us on a path to not only meet your deficit reduction target, but to do so ahead of schedule.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tax revenues have surged under President Bush while spending has been under strict control.  That’s good to know as I’m sure glad we still have Federal surpluses!</p>
<p><em><strong>Update II</strong></em>: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/05/a_realitybased_.html">Brad</a> <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/05/the_paulson_tre.html">DeLong</a> appears to be more hopeful than I am as to Paulson being able to make a difference.  <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MzgzNDRmZjUwNTE4YTlkOGJkYjI0NWRkZDIzZjFhYjQ=">Rich Lowry</a> writes:<br />
<blockquote>Some people guess that Paulson taking the job might mean that the position will have more heft than it has had to this point in the Bush administration and also that there may be some significant policy proposals coming eventually. He has a reputation as a very smart guy and has been a defender of the Bush tax cuts. He should pretty quickly give Bush added credibility on the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Paulson is defending these tax cuts – then prey tell, what are those “significant policy proposals” going to be: (a) serious and specific reductions in Federal spending; or (b) a decision to default on Federal obligations?  I guess “eventually” means after the November 2006 elections.</p>
<p>Update III: <a href="http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.24454/pub_detail.asp">Kevin Hassett</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>So if Snow does depart next month, I, for one, will be very sorry to see him go. When history hands down its marks for Bush administration officials, Snow will be one of the few to have deserved an A.</p></blockquote>
<p>Talk about grade inflation!</p>

                                <p>Did Jonah Goldberg bore even himself with those pointless attacks on Al Gore?  It seems he is now pointing to a redux of the <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MTdiMTJhM2I0MDVkNjY2MDA5Yjk4YzAzM2I3NzAxOTY=">Swift Boat Liars</a> leading with some long-winded nonsense from <a href="http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2006/05/bring_it_on.html">Tom Maguire</a>. The geography lesson from <a href="http://confederateyankee.mu.nu/archives/178846.php">Confederate Yankee</a> cracked me up:<br />
<blockquote>John Kerry did not take anyone into Cambodia from his swift boat based at Ha Tien. The navigable Giang Thanh River runs near the Cambodian border, but at no point does it ever cross.</p></blockquote>
<p>But look at Confederate Yankee’s own map – there are rivers that flow off the Giang Thanh that do cross into Cambodia. </p>
<p>Confederate Yankee did reply to my comment with a portion of the cited in the source that described part of the logistics.  His devastating evidence is that Lt. Kerry did not mention entering another body of water.  As Confederate Yankee stated – Kerry may not have had a map.  Confederate Yankee also notes there were rivers to the east.  Maybe he should check his own map – as there were rivers to the west as well.</p>
<p>But ask let&#8217;s brave soldier Jonah Goldberg if he ever ventured out in the jungles of Indochina along with Lt. Kerry.  Maybe he might be able to settle this geographical dispute with his personal knowledge from the battlefield</p>
<p>Update: The August 15, 2004 article by <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002005720_cambodia15.html">Scott Canon</a> may be a little help here:<br />
<blockquote>Yet the Kerry campaign said it was far from rare for American forces to pursue Viet Cong over the border. &#8220;Swift Boat crews regularly operated along the Cambodian border from Ha Tien on the Gulf of Thailand to the rivers of the Mekong south and west of Saigon,&#8221; Michael Meehan, a senior adviser in the Kerry campaign, said Friday. &#8220;Boats often received fire from enemy taking sanctuary across the border. Kerry&#8217;s was not the only United States riverboat to respond, inadvertently or responsibly, across the border.&#8221; &#8220;Many times he was on or near the Cambodian border and on one occasion crossed into Cambodia at the request of members of a special operations group operating out of Ha Tien&#8221; on the Gulf of Thailand, Meehan said in his statement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Confederate Yankee traces through the details of one trip up the Ha Tien where he notes Lt. Kerry’s boat went near the border.  Kerry’s account seems to be consistent with that for some of his missions – but there were many such missions.  If on any one such mission – Kerry’s crew crossed into Cambodia – he told the truth.  But don’t expect Confederate Yankee to even acknowledge as much.</p>
<p>In addition, note that <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200408250005">John O’Neill</a> claimed he took the boat that Kerry used to command (before O’Neill did) into Cambodia.  I guess Confederate Yankee will have some magic explanation as to how O’Neill is a better sailor than Kerry.</p>

Gennett</a> &#8211; president of the Carolinas chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America &#8211; arguing for more immigration on the grounds that there is a labor shortage in the commercial building sector.  Dean reviews the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and writes:<br />
<blockquote>inflation adjusted wages for construction workers have actually fallen about 5 percent since 1980, a period in which productivity has increased by more than 70 percent. So, we have wages falling in spite of a labor shortage – not where I learned my economics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now you might be thinking – what about total compensation which includes fringe benefits?  Or – what has happened in the last couple of years.  Checking the Employer Cost for Employee Compensation data for the construction sector, we see that nominal wages were $18.47 per hour two years ago and are $191.19 per hour now – a 3.9% increase.  Fringe benefits rose from $8.57 per hour to $9.37 per hour over the same period – a 9.3% increase.  Total compensation therefore rose from $27.05 per hour to $28.65 per hour – a 5.9% increase in nominal compensation.  The consumer price index over the past two years has increased by 6.6%.  Even when we include fringe benefits, real compensation in this sector has declined over the past two years.  This does not sound like a shortage to me.</p>

<blockquote>I&#8217;m hoping to do more examples of &#8220;correlation does not imply causation,&#8221; so if you come across examples of spurious correlation</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that Kash pointed to my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/economics-according-to-john-and-tony.html">ice cream as medicine</a> example, I’ll return the favor by pointing to his <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/laffer-curve-in-everyday-life.html">mow the grass</a> example.  After all, it is the Memorial Day extended weekend.  </p>
<p>Mark draws from the Simpsons:</p>
<blockquote><p>Homer: Not a bear in sight. The &#8220;Bear Patrol&#8221; is working like a charm!<br />Lisa: That&#8217;s specious reasoning, Dad.<br />Homer: [uncomprehendingly] Thanks, honey.<br />Lisa: By your logic, I could claim that this rock keeps tigers away.<br />Homer: Hmm. How does it work?<br />Lisa: It doesn&#8217;t work; it&#8217;s just a stupid rock!<br />Homer: Uh-huh.<br />Lisa: But I don&#8217;t see any tigers around, do you?<br />Homer: (pause) Lisa, I want to buy your rock.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wasn’t it Homer Simpson that got excited about a $5 tax rebate as he failed to understand the looming deferred tax liability brought to him by the large tax shifts (not cuts) that favor the well to do?  President Bush is looking for a new Treasury Secretary to market his fiscal policies.  I can’t think of a better candidate than Homer Simpson.</p>

                                <p>Lawrence Kudlow will use any excuse to falsely claim that Reagan’s fiscal stimulus increased long-term growth.  His <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NmZlNzU0NWIyMDA5NDAzOGNmZWJiYTY3ZGFjZWFlZmM=">latest</a> uses the convictions of Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling as the backdrop to write:<br />
<blockquote>Capitalism in this country has been under assault ever since FDR’s New Deal 1930s, a time when a number of alphabet agencies attempted to control America’s industrial and farming sectors. The experiment soon proved a dismal failure, with unemployment running 20 to 25 percent up until WWII. It was only when Roosevelt started unleashing businesses to produce wartime goods that the economy ultimately resurrected. Still, the American welfare state would grow. In the 1960s and 1970s, the murderer’s row of economic morons &#8211; LBJ, Nixon, Ford, and Carter &#8211; in allegiance with their liberal Keynesian advisors, concocted a socialist policy mix that ultimately led to wealth-destroying big-government stagflation. Providentially, Ronald Reagan changed all that in the 1980s. The Gipper slashed tax rates, deregulated industries, and rescued the dollar, unleashing the forces of entrepreneurial capitalism. As a result, for the first time since the post-Civil War period (but for the brief Coolidge-Melon period in the 1920s), the American economic system became the envy of the world. Since the early 1980s, more than 46 million new jobs have been created, with inflation-adjusted GDP increasing $6.2 trillion, or 120 percent. </p></blockquote>
<p>Where to begin? Real GDP in 2005 was 115% higher than it was in 1980, which translates into an average annual growth of only 3.12%.  Kudlow forgets to mention that real GDP growth during Clinton’s tenure – where tax rates were increased – was 3.7%.  Real GDP growth under Reagan, Bush41, and Bush43 has averaged less than 3% per year.  He also fails to mention that real GDP in 1980 was 133% higher than it was in 1955 – another time span of 25 years.  In other words, real GDP growth averaged 3.45% per year during a period that included those “economic morons”.  And when Kudlow criticizes LBJ’s Keynesian advisors for the acceleration of inflation, he should be criticizing <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/george-w-bush-lbj-on-fiscal-policy.html">Norman Ture</a> – the mentor of all free lunch supply-siders.</p>
<p>Kudlow should also be careful tossing around the term economic morons given his spin on whether we should go back to the “Coolidge-Melon period” that predated SEC type regulations. Kudlow would have his readers believe that the only corporate crooks in the history of time were the executives of Enron.  Excuse me for saying this – but even the readers of the National Review are not that ignorant.  Finally, Kudlow fails to mention the Republican President who took office in 1929 as he tries to blame the Great Depression on FDR.  Ah Larry, the stock market crashed in 1929 &#8211; not 1933.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/05/will_somebody_p.html">Brad DeLong</a> has more criticism of Kudlow’s insanity noting that the unemployment rate increased to 33% under Hoover&#8217;s Administration and declined during FDR&#8217;s first two terms in office.  Over the 12 years that FDR served as President, real GDP increased by over 180%.  Compare that to the 115% increase over the past 25 years.  To be fair, we shuold really be comparing real GDP in 1954 v. real GDP in 1929 as 1933 was the bottom of the Great Depression and 1945 was the tail end of World War II.  OK, real GDP grew by 139% over this 25-year period. </p>

<blockquote>As I&#8217;ve said before, the country is full with lots of excellent, thoughtful right-wing economists who would love to write for National Review.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thoughtful economists might be better described as conservative rather than right-wing.  With that said, John Stuart Mill’s <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRmill.htm">March 1866 letter</a> to Sir John Pakington may apply:<br />
<blockquote>I never meant to say that the Conservatives are generally stupid. I meant to say that stupid people are generally Conservative. I believe that is so obviously and universally admitted a principle that I hardly think any gentleman will deny it.</p></blockquote>
<p>No one can deny two propositions: (1) there are many smart conservative economists; and (2) not one of them write for the National Review – at least on a regular basis.</p>

<blockquote>The saving rate began falling in the early 1990s as households increased consumption in response to their rising level of wealth – initially a rising stock market and, more importantly, double digit increases in house prices. More recently, this wealth effect was reinforced by the rise in mortgage refinancing that was induced by falling interest rates. Households extracted trillions of dollars &#8230; from the value of their homes and a substantial part of that cash found its way into consumer spending. The forces that lowered the US saving rate are now being reversed. House prices nationwide are down from the peak reached in the middle of last summer. The Federal Reserve has reversed its low interest rate policy &#8230; It will only be a matter of time until the household saving rate is at least back to the 2.4 per cent level of 2002. To convert this higher saving to a reduction in the current account deficit requires increased exports and a shift in Americans’ spending from imports to domestically produced goods and services. A lower dollar will provide the necessary incentive for both of those changes to occur. </p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the recent increase in interest rates combined with a possible reversal of the wealth effect will induce households to save (rather than consume) more of their after-tax income. <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/05/interest_rates_.html">Mark Thoma</a> focused on the movement along the savings schedule aspect rather than the wealth effect induced shift of the savings schedule – and then provided us an interesting time series graph of the personal savings rate versus the nominal interest rate on Treasury bills.</p>
<p>I could be critical of Mark’s graph and argue that we should be looking at the real interest rate, but then for the last 20 years or so, much of the movement in nominal rates has likely been movements in real rates as inflation has been relatively low and stable (as compared to say the 1970’s and early 1980’s).  I could also note that correlations of two endogenous variables (interest rates and savings rates) over time tells us little about the elasticity of their relationship when both the demand curve (investment) and the supply curve (savings) shift over time.  But this is where the story gets interesting.</p>
<p>Part of the debate over whether Bush’s fiscal folly would massively crowd out investment &#8211; at least in terms of a long-run neoclassical growth model &#8211; has to do with one’s views as to the Ricardian Equivalence proposition that a reduction in public savings would be matched by an increase in private savings.  Simply put – the fall in private savings might at first glance be a puzzle to true believers in the Ricardian Equivalence proposition.  Many of us have argued, however, the fiscal folly has indeed induced an inward shift of the national savings schedule.  Ricardians might counter than the alleged inward shift was due to wealth effects.  </p>
<p>Of course, an inward shift of the savings schedule should have increased real interest rates – to which Ben Bernanke argued we have been witnessing a global savings glut.  Others (including me) have argued the fall in real interest rates was more due to the decline in investment demand as well as net exports – at least in terms of the U.S. economy.  Feldstein is arguing that part of the reason for low savings rates is simply this shift along the savings schedule.  The good news is that the global investment deficiency is reversing itself and Feldstein is hoping the same thing happens in regards U.S. net exports.  And with an outward shift in the demand for loanable funds driving up interest rates, Feldstein is hoping for an increase in national savings on his premise that the national savings schedule is not perfectly inelastic.  </p>
<p>While I have similar hopes in regards investment and net export demand, we have to ask whether the observed correlation between savings rates and interest rates is solid evidence for the proposition of an elastic savings schedule.  On this empirical issue, I just don’t know.</p>

<p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/05/paul_krugman_a_.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/2006/05/26/opinion/26krugman.html&#038;OQ=_rQ3D1&#038;OP=30956cd1Q2FvQ3FLQ3BvfQ5Bi..fvSQ3CQ3CXvQ3C,vSXv.)aAa.AvSXWiQ27OQ24@AQ20Q51fQ24p">Paul Krugman</a> who does know how to read the evidence:<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Gore couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better illustration of disinformation campaigns than the reaction of energy-industry lobbyists and right-wing media organizations to his film. &#8230; As evidence that global warming isn&#8217;t really happening, [the National Review] offers the fact that some Antarctic ice sheets are getting thicker &#8230; Curt Davis, &#8230; whose work is cited &#8230; has already protested. &#8230; He points out that an initial increase in the thickness of Antarctica&#8217;s interior ice sheets is a predicted consequence of a warming planet, so that his results actually support global warming &#8230; [T]hey [also] issue hysterical warnings about the economic consequences of environmentalism. &#8220;Al Gore&#8217;s global warming movie: could it destroy the economy?&#8221; Fox News asked. Well, no, it couldn&#8217;t. There&#8217;s &#8230; broad consensus that even a very strong program to reduce emissions would have only modest effects on economic growth. At worst, G.D.P. growth might be, say, one-tenth or two-tenths of a percentage point lower over the next 20 years. &#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>And if one needs evidence that the National Review is guilty as charged, read <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzQwMWRjZWFmMzIyNzc3OWQ3YjUwMTk0OWYzMWMwZGY=">Rich Lowry</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Antarctic Peninsula has indeed been melting, but it constitutes only 2 percent of Antarctica’s total area. 2002 study in Nature found that two-thirds of the continent actually got colder from 1966 to 2000. A 2005 study published in Science looked at about 70 percent of Antarctica’s surface area and reported that the East Antarctic ice sheet had gained &#8211; yes, gained &#8211; 45 billion tons of ice annually between 1992 and 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, that 2% does sound small – doesn’t it?  Of course, the National Review crows over a couple of billion dollars in Federal spending reductions as if that’s going to solve the massive Federal deficit problem even though it is only 0.2% of GDP.  But has Lowry done the math as to the effect of the additional water in the oceans and their effects on coastal property.  No, Aunt Bee of Topeka, Kansas has more to worry about from NSA wiretaps of her calls than she does in terms of her backyard being flooded – but there are a lot of people who do live near the shores.</p>
<p>Lowry also linked to <a href="http://nrd.nationalreview.com/article/?q=NjAxNzZjNTU4OGIyZWYxYTgwMzZhOTFiNmYwZTUyZmU=">Jason Lee Steorts</a> who writes:<br />
<blockquote>What is not moral is to distort the truth for political ends &#8211; which is precisely what has been done with the ice-caps story.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Steorts was talking about the distortions found in the National Review.</p>

                                <p>It’s been over a year since <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/01/kudlow-and-atlanta-fed-on-labor-force.html">we discussed</a> a paper on labor force participation by <a href="http://www.frbatlanta.org/invoke.cfm?objectid=B2793305-CF9B-64C1-13B6F8CEA41A2C22&#038;method=display">Julie Hotchkiss</a> of the Atlanta Federal Reserve. The latest paper from Julie Hotchkiss addresses the rise in <a href="http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/erq206_hotchkiss.pdf">female labor force participation</a> from 1975 to the late 1990’s as well as the recent reversal of this trend:</p>
<blockquote><p>After decades of consistent increases, the labor force participation of women began to flatten out in the late 1990s and decline after 2000. This article investigates the changes in the labor force participation rate among women aged twenty-five to fifty-four that have occurred over the past thirty years &#8230; The rate of change in behavior has also declined over the past thirty years. Indeed, behavioral change between 1994 and 2005 had a direct negative influence on the observed decline in the labor force participation rate during these decades. Special attention is given to the unprecedented 2.7 percentage point decline in the labor force participation rate between 2000 and 2005, which can be explained by changes in both behavior and characteristics, with weaker labor market conditions in 2005 being one of the characteristics providing the greatest downward pressure. However, if the unemployment rate had been at the 2000 level of 4.5 percent in 2005 (holding everything else at 2005 levels), the labor force participation rate of women would still have been 2.3 percentage points lower than in 2000.</p></blockquote>
<p>While some of us economists on the left wish to emphasize how weak the labor market remains citing the fact that the employment to population ratio is still far below where it was in 2000, some of the economists on the right are arguing that part of this decline represents choices and not weak aggregate demand.  Hotchkiss’s conclusions give a bit of ammunition for those on the right.  (Hat tip to Mark Thoma for his email).</p>

<p>As I read <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/05/national_review_1.html">Brad DeLong</a> fulfilling the plea from Jonah Goldberg:<br />
<blockquote>Well, we want to put up more quotes from the pages of NR, past, present and future there</p></blockquote>
<p>I had to wonder.  Brad is a very good economist and yet he provided quotes about NR’s racism and love for Joseph McCarthy but nothing on economics.  Then I read <a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/05/problems-with-venezuelan-numbers.html">Dean Baker</a>:<br />
<blockquote>It appears that Mexico is not the only Latin American country for which the media have difficulty with official statistics. Apparently, the media have been anxious to tout high poverty numbers for Venezuela. The problem appears to be that they want to cite poverty data for 2004, which showed a large upturn in the poverty rate in the immediate wake of a strike in the oil sector. The Venezuelan economy rebounded sharply in 2005, and the poverty rate predictably fell back below its previous levels. However, even though the 2005 data is now available, the media continues to use the much higher numbers from 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which reminded me of the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/johnson200403051032.asp">Stephen Johnson</a> hit piece on Venezuela&#8217;s president, Hugo Chavez:<br /><strong><br />
<blockquote>Venezuela now rivals Haiti in poverty and underemployment.</p></blockquote>
<p></strong><br />Really?! Dean points us to a recent study from <a href="http://www.cepr.net/publications/venezuelan_poverty_rates_2006_05.pdf">CEPR</a>. Poverty rates in terms of the number of people before 1999 exceeded 50% but had declined to 45.4% by the end of 2001.  CEPR notes the decline in poverty was attributable to strong economic growth.  The oil strike, however, led to a recession and an increase in poverty.  By the end of 2005, however, the number of people living below the poverty line fell to 43.7% as the economy recovered from the oil strike led recession.  As CEPR notes:<br />
<blockquote>How then have so many people reached a different conclusion? The most common mistake has been to use the data from the first half of 2004, which was gathered in the first quarter of that year. The household poverty rate at that time was 53.1 percent, which is of course up enormously from 1999. There are several things wrong with using this measure. Most importantly, this poverty rate is measuring the impact of the oil strike and recession of 2002-2003. Poverty rates are very sensitive to expansion and downturns in the economy, so to compare 1999 with the first quarter of 2004, leaving off the subsequent recovery, is meaningless and misleading. As noted above, the Venezuelan economy grew by 17.9 percent in 2004, and by 9.3 percent in 2005. We would expect and, in fact, did see a massive reduction in poverty from an economic recovery of this magnitude. So most of the news reports and articles alleging an increase in poverty under the Chávez administration are analogous to comparing winter temperatures to spring temperatures, and concluding on that basis that there is no global warming. </p></blockquote>
<p>Dean is frustrated that the press does such a poor job in reporting economic matters.  I guess it would be expecting too much from the National Review especially given their tendency to cherry pick variations in economic data and report them as if they are long-term trends.  </p>
<p>And while we are on the topic of misrepresenting data, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/05/immigrants_and_.html">Mark Thoma</a> catches <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzFhZDE2Y2NiYzQzY2NiY2MxMjIwY2I3OWFhNzgzNTQ=">Robert Rector</a> relying on Heritage Foundation spin on immigration that has already been debunked by a <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/5-24-06imm.htm">CBPP</a> analysis.</p>
