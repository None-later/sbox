                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I’d like to get back to a problem that I was <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/vat-as-solution-to-fiscal-nightmare.html">writing about last week</a>: the possibility of using a value-added tax (VAT) to fix the “on-budget” federal budget deficit.  That deficit, which excludes the Social Security trust fund (which will run a modest but declining surplus), is likely to be in the neighborhood of 4-5% of GDP per year during the next decade, and after that will start growing alarmingly, if for no other reason then simply to make interest payments on the debt.  Let me repost the picture of the US&#8217;s “<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/true-fiscal-nightmare.html">Fiscal Nightmare</a>” for reference (see that post for details of my assumptions).</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/gen_fund_deficit.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that this may be an optimistic scenario: it assumes that the Bush tax cuts are all reversed in four years, and that there are no major recessions.  A moderate recession could easily worsen the deficit significantly.  </p>
<p>Let us suppose that the deficit is big enough, persistent enough, and growing fast enough (all of which seems reasonably likely in another 15 years) that it can not be left unchecked &#8211; the financial markets will start to wreak havoc with interest rates if we do.</p>
<p>So here’s your assignment, should you choose to accept it: close a budget gap of $600-$700bn (expressed in today&#8217;s dollars, as are all dollar figures below) per year.  As I laid out in my “Fiscal Nightmare” post, it’s awfully hard to get there through spending cuts, with the possible exception of enacting a radical change in the way health care is paid for in the US.  Let&#8217;s suppose that such a major overhaul in the nation&#8217;s health care system is not going to happen any time soon.</p>
<p>But let’s be optimistic and suppose that you could wring out $200bn worth of savings from the spending side of the budget, e.g. by substantially cutting defense spending, identifying some “corporate welfare” that can be cut, and perhaps by reducing some non-Social Security entitlements.  That would still leave you with an annual general fund deficit of perhaps $500bn.  What are your options?
<ol>
<li>Cut spending even more.  Perhaps we could trim another $100bn off of defense spending, bringing defense spending down to around 2% of GDP (which would be the lowest rate of defense spending since the 1930s).  Any further spending cuts to close the remaining $400bn gap would almost surely hit the poor the hardest, and substantially (or completely) unravel the US’s social safety net.  But they are certainly a possibility, and what many “<a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/04/bartlett_starve.html">starve the beast</a>” conservatives hope would happen.  Myself, I am not a fan of this option.</p>
</li>
<li>Raise income tax rates.   My back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, to raise an additional $500bn in revenue per year through income taxes, changes in marginal rates would have to be of roughly this order of magnitude:  today’s 15% rate would rise to 25%, today’s 25% rate would rise to 35%, today’s 33% rate would rise to 45%, today’s 35% rate would rise to 55%.   The political impact of suggesting that a middle-class family go from a current tax rate of 25% to a tax rate of 35% would be substantial, and not only the wealthy would complain about top marginal tax rates of 50% or more.  Marginal tax rates that are that high also probably imply a substantial increase in tax-avoiding behavior, particularly by the wealthy, and may also have adverse macroeconomic effects.  However, this is an important possibility to consider.
</li>
<li>Enact other taxes.  A gas tax of even $1.00 per gallon would only raise $75-$100bn per year, depending on how much conservation you think we would start to see.   Taxing capital gains and dividends at marginal income tax rates might raise $25-$50bn per year.  Other suggestions?  So far we’re about one-fourth of the way there.
<p>Maybe we could end the tax exclusion of employer-provided health insurance, which would raise another $50bn annually, or impose a carbon tax, which would raise perhaps $25-$50bn annually, or end the home mortgage-interest deduction, raising another $50-$75bn annually.  We’re still far from balancing the budget, but this package of tax changes will certainly provoke a political response.  (For a good list of other possibilities, see the CBO document “<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6075&#038;sequence=0">Budget Options</a>”.) </p>
</li>
<li>Enact a VAT.  A 10% VAT, paired with an increase in personal exemptions/deductions/tax credits to ensure that lower-income families do not contribute a larger share of tax revenue (see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/tax-progressivity-and-income_31.html">this post</a> on why a VAT need not be regressive), would probably do the trick and raise the necessary $500bn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Are there other possible options?  Certainly.  But I doubt you can think of any that would close more than a tiny fraction of the looming general fund deficit.  Given that, I think it’s reasonable to say that in 10 or 15 years policy-makers in the US will be forced to pick from a list much like the one I’ve given above.  If they happen to bite the bullet a bit earlier, then so much the better, because then the needed changes to fix the problem would be smaller.  But the basic policy choices would still be the same.</p>
<p>Obviously, there would be significant political resistance to all of these options.  It’s just a question of picking your poison.  Which flavor would you choose?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2138935">Mickey Kaus</a> thinks so:<br />
<blockquote>Earned Income Tax Credit does send cash to low income earners, but again you need to earn at least some money to get it. And it&#8217;s already pretty big. We probably can&#8217;t increase it much higher without running into cost and disincentive problems when the credit is phased out in the mid-income ranges (i.e. workers will end up losing&#8211;in phases-out EITC payments &#8211; a good chunk of any extra dollars they earn).</p></blockquote>
<p>What is up with Mickey Kaus and Michael Lind as to the EITC issue? <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002109.html">Max Sawicky</a> counters:<br />
<blockquote>As for disincentives, there is no empirical evidence of &#8216;harmful&#8217; effects. The effect in question, boils down to a family with children supplying 50 hours of work a week of 75. Is this really a problem? The impact on full-time labor force participation for the primary earner in a family is unambiguously positive.</p></blockquote>
<p>EITC is a form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax">Negative Income Tax</a>, which can be designed to lessen the disincentives to work.  As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_Income_Tax_Credit">Wikpedia</a> notes:<br />
<blockquote>Under traditional welfare, a dollar-for-dollar decrease of benefits corresponded to an increase in earnings. Standard indifference curve analysis shows that this creates a &#8220;spiked&#8221; budget constraint of OABC, making it very likely that an individual&#8217;s utility maximizing bundle includes no work. The EITC, in contrast to traditional welfare, creates a &#8220;smoother&#8221; budget constraint of OABCD, making it theoretically much more likely that an individual&#8217;s utility-maximizing bundle will include some hours of work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wikpedia even provides the graphs displaying their indifference curve analysis.  </p>
<p>Speaking of graphs, <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002105.html">Max Sawicky</a> provides his graph on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/on-incidence-of-earned-income-tax_31.html">Incidence of the Earned Income Tax Credit</a>.  I provide a somewhat different variation of the theme, but the point is still the same – if the elasticity of labor supply is less than the elasticity of labor demand, then most of the benefits from the EITC accrue to workers as the reduction in wage rates (W0 to W1) is modest relative to the size of the subsidy.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.generalzinni.com/">Anthony Zinni</a> co-authored <em>Battle Ready</em> with Tom Clancy and served in the Marines from the 1960’s to 2000.  From 1997 to 2000, General Zinni was Commander in Chief of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command">CENTCOM</a>.  Zinni is also a conservative Republican.  Given his expertise, one would have thought President Bush would have heeded Zinni’s counsel not to invade Iraq.</p>
<p>Zinni appeared on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12067487/page/6">Meet The Press</a> right after Senator McCain’s appearance.  Contrast the spin from McCain to this straight talk from Zinni:<br />
<blockquote>Well, I—first of all, I saw it in the way the intelligence was being portrayed. I knew the intelligence; I saw it right up to the day of the war. I was asked at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing a month before the war if I thought the threat was imminent. I didn’t. Many of the people I know that were involved in the intelligence side of this, or, or in the military felt the same way. I saw the—what this town is known for: spin, cherry-picking facts, using metaphors to evoke certain emotional responses, or, or shading the, the context. We, we know the mushroom clouds and, and the other things that were all described that the media’s covered well. I saw on the ground, though, a sort of walking away from 10 years worth of planning. You know, ever since the end of the first Gulf War, there have been—there’s been planning by serious officers and planners and others, and policies put in place. Ten years worth of planning, you know, were thrown away; troop levels dismissed out of hand; General Shinseki basically insulted for speaking the truth and giving a, an honest opinion; the lack of cohesive approach to how we deal with the aftermath; the political, economic, social reconstruction of a nation, which is no small task; a belief in these exiles that anyone in the region, anyone that had any knowledge would tell you were not credible on the ground; and on and on and on. Decisions to disband the army that were not in the initial plans. I mean there’s a series of disastrous mistakes. We just heard the secretary of state say these were tactical mistakes. These were not tactical mistakes. These were strategic mistakes, mistakes of policy made back here. Don’t blame the troops. They’re the ones that perform the tactics on the ground.

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Census Bureau <a href="http://www.census.gov/const/C30/release.pdf">reported</a> a sharp rise in U.S. construction spending in February led by private residential construction spending.  Private residential spending increased to a record $665.7 Billion in February (SA, annual rate), 1.3% above the revised January estimate.</p>
<p>The first graph shows private U.S. construction spending for single family homes since 1993.  All numbers are annual rates and seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/640/construction.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/320/construction.jpg"></a><br /><i>Click on graphs for larger images.</i></p>
<p>But aren&#8217;t sales falling?  The second graph shows single family construction spending, adjusted for inflation, compared to New Home Sales.  The year 2000 = 100 for both series.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/640/spending.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/320/spending.jpg"></a></p>
<p>This shows the divergence of construction spending and New Home Sales over the last few months.  Although the data series for construction spending is only available back to 1993, we can also look at construction employment vs. New Home Sales for historical patterns.  In previous slowdowns, construction employment also kept rising for six months to a year after the peak of the housing cycle (see <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/03/new-homes-sales-vs-construction.html">New Homes Sales vs. Construction Employment</a>)</p>
<p>So this is a common occurrence in the early stages of a housing slowdown; homebuilders just keep on building.  Maybe homebuilders believe sales will bounce back.  Or maybe builders are rushing projects to completion.  But the result is predictable if the sales slowdown continues: more inventory, and probably price pressures with some speculative builders possibly in financial distress next year.</p>

<blockquote>James E. Hansen, director of NASA&#8217;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, has been telling the world that story for many years … Roy Spencer, a research scientist for the University of Alabama in Huntsville who disagrees with Hansen&#8217;s science, recently wrote: “Hansen is a smart, productive public servant that is on a crusade for what he believes in.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If Novak thinks Spencer is the leading authority on the global warming issue, may I suggest he reads <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/050811_global_warming.html">Ker Than</a>:<br />
<blockquote>For years, skeptics of global warming have used satellite and weather balloon data to argue that climate models were wrong and that global warming isn&#8217;t really happening. Now, according to three new studies published in the journal Science, it turns out those conclusions based on satellite and weather balloon data were based on faulty analyses. The atmosphere is indeed warming, not cooling as the data previously showed &#8230; According to Santer, the only group to previously analyze satellite data on the troposphere &#8211; the lowest layer in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere &#8211; was a research team headed by Roy Spencer from University of Alabama in 1992.  &#8220;This was used by some critics to say &#8216;We don&#8217;t believe in climate models, they&#8217;re wrong,'&#8221; Santer told LiveScience. &#8220;Other people used the disconnect between what the satellites told and what surface thermometers told us to argue that the surface data were wrong and that earth wasn&#8217;t really warming because satellites were much more accurate.&#8221; The Alabama researchers introduced a correction factor to account for drifting in the satellites used to sample Earth&#8217;s daily temperature cycles. But in another Science paper published today, Carl Mears and Rank Wentz, scientists at the California-based Remote Sensing Systems, examined the same data and identified an error in Spencer&#8217;s analysis technique. After correcting for the mistake, the researchers obtained fundamentally different results: whereas Spencer&#8217;s analysis showed a cooling of the Earth&#8217;s troposphere, the new analysis revealed a warming. Using the analysis from Mears and Wentz, Santer showed that the new data was consistent with climate models and theories. &#8220;When people come up with extraordinary claims &#8211; like the troposphere is cooling &#8211; then you demand extraordinary proof,&#8221; Santer said. &#8220;What&#8217;s happening now is that people around the world are subjecting these data sets to the scrutiny they need.&#8221; </p></blockquote>

                                <p>It seems that Josh Bolton and I agree on one thing – but for very different reasons.  We both want <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12078861">John Snow</a> to resign from the position of Treasury Secretary:<br />
<blockquote>Joshua Bolten, the incoming White House chief of staff, wants Treasury Secretary John Snow replaced with someone who can present the administration&#8217;s message more forcefully … The Times quoted Republicans as saying if a new secretary was picked from Wall Street, it would help reassure financial markets that are worried about growing budget and trade deficits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation – everyone has figured out that Sec. Snow tells the public the spin de jour concocted by Karl Rove, so it’s time to bring in a new liar.  I want Snow to resign precisely because he does try to convey the White House message – which of course, means he has to lie.  Neither Bolton nor President Bush is interested in the least in having the Treasury Secretary convey an honest message.  For doing their bidding, the Treasury Secretary is about to get the pink slip.  Of course, now, Dr. Snow might be free to attempt to revive the integrity he once had before he decided to take the job of chief financial spinmeister.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, no amount of spin will convince financial markets that Bush is serious about reducing the budget deficit until he decides to reverse some of those alleged tax cuts.  To suggest Wall Street can be so easily fooled has to be really insulting to those who work on Wall Street.  </p>
<p>On a related note, Sec. Snow had to backpedal on his recent comments regarding an Estate Tax compromise.  From <em>Tax Analysts</em>:<br />
<blockquote>Treasury Secretary John Snow on March 30 retreated from comments made two days earlier that suggested the administration may be willing to compromise on estate tax repeal. “I want to make it clear that Congress needs to pass legislation that permanently repeals the death tax, without compromise,” Snow said in prepared comments before the Edison Electric Institute Board of Directors in Washington. Just two days earlier at a Tax Executives Institute conference in Washington, Snow had hinted that the administration for the first time might accept less than full repeal, assuming that a full repeal bill got a fair shake first.  “I would hope that we&#8217;d have the chance to test the political strength of that idea [of full repeal] and hopefully prevail, but if not, come to some second-best outcome that would also be more advantageous than where we are today,” Snow said on March 28. </p></blockquote>
<p>A willingness to compromise?  Is this the real reason why the White House wants Snow to go?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/04/record-increase-in-national-debt.html">CalculatedRisk</a> contrasts the reality of another “Record Increase in National Debt” to something Josh Bolton said on July 14, 2005:<br />
<blockquote>Since last February, when we released the 2006 Budget, the Nation’s fiscal outlook has improved dramatically. The U.S. budget deficit is falling, and it is falling fast. </p></blockquote>
<p>If I had my way, CR would get to pick the next Treasury Secretary.</p>

                                <p>Interest rates continue their climb&#8230; and long rates have risen by enough in recent weeks (today they&#8217;re roughly at their highest levels since mid-2002) to shut down discussion of the &#8220;inverted yield curve&#8221;, at least temporarily.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/rates2_apr06.jpg"></p>
<p>This raises a good question: is it more contractionary for the economy (or less expanionary, depending on how you want to look at it) to have a flat yield curve with interest rates of 4.5%, as we did 6 weeks ago&#8230; or for the yield curve to not be inverted but to have top long-term rates of 4.9%, as we have today?</p>

He also reviews a recent paper by <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/es/commentary/journals/bpea_macro/forum/agenda.htm">Stephanie Aaronson, Bruce Fallick, Andrew Figura, Jonathan Pingle and William Wascher</a> entitled <em>The Recent Decline in Labor Force Participation and its Implications for Potential Labor Supply</em> that gives evidence that David may have a point.  David cites a couple of paragraphs that might support the premise that the fall in labor force participation was driven by real business cycle factors, but also note the opening paragraph of the paper’s conclusion:<br />In this paper, we have reviewed an array of evidence pertaining to the sources of the persistent decline in the aggregate labor force participation rate since 2000. </p>
<blockquote><p>In broad terms, this evidence suggests that the business cycle initially played an important role in this decline, contributing to the sharp run-up in labor force participation in the late 1990s and to both the subsequent drop-off during the 2001 recession and the ensuing period of weak labor market performance over the next couple of years. However, the evidence also highlights a number of more structural factors that have contributed to a potentially longer-lasting downtrend in labor force participation.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the authors are not dismissing the Keynesian explanation as at least part of the story for the past few years.  The debate continues.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/node/28445">Max Sawicky</a> takes on this comment from Michael Lind:<br />
<blockquote>Why do right-wing Republicans, and conservative Southern Democrats like Lloyd Bentsen, love the EITC?  Because it is a taxpayer subsidy to employers which enables them to pay below-poverty wages to their workers.  In other words, the EITC is corporate welfare, a massive redistribution of wealth to the very employers that treat their workers the worst.</p></blockquote>
<p>More from <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=article&#038;DocID=564">Michael Lind</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The greatest challenge to the formation of a powerful liberal-centrist bloc in favor of a living wage is the seductive alternative of the earned income tax credit (EITC). Many moderates view it not as a supplement to high wages but as a substitute for them … It is unlikely that the EITC would have received the enthusiastic support of many pro-business conservatives and moderates, however, if it did not disguise a business subsidy … The EITC permits them to do something for low-wage workers without threatening their donors in industries that rely on cheap labor. In effect, it is a double subsidy. By aiding the worker the EITC enables the employer to continue paying far less than is needed to survive at or above the Federal poverty line. The Southern cotton mill owner pays his workers a pittance—and you and I, fellow taxpayers, cough up an additional “social wage,” the EITC. The consumer, who otherwise would have to forgo the good or service or pay more for it, also benefits. Make that a triple subsidy. In addition, the EITC is probably an interregional corporate welfare program. To my knowledge nobody has studied the issue, but it is a fair guess that the South, with the lowest wages, the lowest levels of employment benefits, and the lowest rate of unionization in the United States, receives a disproportionate share of Federal EITC money.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, Lind goes too far &#8211; but EITC is a subsidy as noted by <a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&#038;name=ViewPrint&#038;articleId=4331">Jared Bernstein</a>, who noted:<br />
<blockquote>The EITC is clearly raising the living standards of low-income working families. Furthermore, the fact that it is tied to work has largely insulated it from partisan attack and has even allowed for its expansion in this era when social welfare spending is so highly scrutinized. Yet the EITC is not perfect. Some of its benefits surely end up subsidizing employers, who would likely have to raise their wage offers in the absence of the program. More important (since this wage effect is probably small), relying solely on tax policy to raise the incomes of low-wage workers is a serious mistake. We also need policies that focus directly on raising pretax wages. Otherwise, we face the likelihood of a perpetually expanding low-end labor market, with jobs that fail to pay a living wage and thus require ever-increasing taxpayer subsidy. </p></blockquote>
<p>It would be interesting to analyze the economics of the policies that would “focus directly on raising pretax wages” in addition to discussing the incidence of the EITC.  Since Lind concedes that some of the incidence of the EITC accrues to workers, let’s also concede that some of the incidence of this subsidy accrues to workers.  However, if the elasticity of labor supply is smaller than the elasticity of labor demand, then most of the incidence of the subsidy accrues to workers – not employers. </p>
<p>Bernstein also notes:<br />
<blockquote>In 1997 the IRS paid out $30.6 billion in EITC claims to about 18.5 million persons. That&#8217;s up from $6.6 billion in 1989 and $1.3 billion in 1975 (in nominal dollars). And we&#8217;ve gotten a lot for the money. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has shown, in 1998 the EITC was responsible for lifting nearly 5 million persons out of poverty &#8230; We have a low-wage labor market problem in this country, and the EITC is an essential part of the solution. But it cannot be the sole solution. Unless we rely on other strategies for improving pretax earnings in the low-wage sector, the living standards of low-income families will be largely dependent on the tax system.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Bernstein is saying that we should supplement the EITC with other policies designed to lift low wage workers out of poverty, I agree and I suspect Max and Michael Lind do as well.</p>
