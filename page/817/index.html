                                <p>Reader Spencer, like a lot of other folks who frequent this blog and similar blogs, has an annoying habit of looking at data, and data has an annoying habit of not necessarily doing what our betters tell us theory says.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Spencer looking at Minimum Wage increases&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>With the Federal minimum wage increasing from $5.15 to $5.85, or 13.6% this week I expected to see several discussion of it on the Web. But it seems to be generating little interest.</p>
<p>But it did suggest that I should take a quick look at what happened so far this year in the seven states that raised their minimum wage in January, 2007. It is too early to have detailed data or comprehensive studies, so I’m just taking a quick first pass at the available data. </p>
<p>The industry most dependent on minimum wage employees is the restaurant industry, so I will compare restaurant employment to trend and employment in other sectors. If the theory that increasing the minimum wage causes minimum wage employment to fall is correct, it should negatively impact these two comparisons.</p>
<p>ARIZONA raised the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.75, or 31.1% they also raised the minimum wage for employees earning tips from $2.13 to $3.75, or 76.1%. From 1997 to 2006 Arizona was one of the fastest growing states and total nonfarm employment rose at an average annual rate of 3.5%, as did employment in Arizona restaurants. In the 12 months ending in June, 2007 total Arizona employment rose 2.9% while employment in</p>
<p>Arizona restaurants rose 4.9%. In the 6 months from December, 2006 to June, 2007, the total actually fell -1.4% while restaurant employment increased 4.1%. This is not seasonally adjusted data, so you have to be careful about using it. However, the evidence shows that restaurant employment rose much faster than other employment and in particularly rose much faster than it had over the previous 9 years when the minimum wage was held constant. Needless to say, this is not what the opponents predicted would happen.</p>
<p>COLORADO raised the overall minimum wage 44.0% and the minimum for those receiving tips 79.8%. Over the past decade total Colorado employment grew at 1.1% rate and restaurant employment expanded at a 1.7% rate. Over the past 12 months total employment rose 1.7% or about 12% faster than the recent trend. Restaurant employment rose 3.75%, or 71% faster than trend. In the last six months the not seasonally adjust gains were 1.1% for total employment and 6.3% for restaurant employment.</p>
<p>MISSOURI raised both its total minimum wage and the one for tip earners 26.2%. The trend growth rate here was 0.5% for total employment and 2.0% for restaurant employment. Over the past year total employment expanded 0.9% while restaurant employment was up 3.6%. The past 6 months NSA gains were 0.8% for the total and 5.8% for restaurants.</p>
<p>MONTANA raised its minimum wage 19.42%. This is the only state in the sample were the trend is for total employment to grow faster than restaurant employment. But over the last year total employment grew 1.6% versus its trend growth rate of 1.9%. But restaurant employment was up 1.4%, or slightly more than its trend growth rate of 1.2%.</p>
<p>The last 6 months NSA increases were 4.1% for total employment and 6.6% for restaurant employment.</p>
<p>NEVADA also raised its minimum wage 19.42%. Navada total employment rose 1.7% this year versus its trend growth rate of 4.8%. Restaurant employment was up 4.5% as compared to a trend growth rate of 8.2%.. So total employment was 36% of trend while restaurant employment was 55% of trend.</p>
<p>OHIO increased both the total minimum wage and the minimum wage for tip earners 33.0%. In Ohio the 9 year trend is for zero growth in total employment and a 1.1% increase in restaurant employment. From June, 2006 to June, 200 total employments fell 0.3% and restaurant employment rose 0.3%.</p>
<p>MASSACUHUSETTES only increased its minimum wage 11.1%. Over the past year total employment rose 1.1% as compared to a 0.4% trend. Restaurant employment rose 1.1% versus its 1.5% trend &#8212; making it and Ohio the only states with below trend restaurant employment growth. The six month NSA increases were 1% for the total and 6.3% for restaurants.</p>
<p>So we had seven states raising their minimum wage from between 11% and 78% for tip earners. The worse case was in Massachusetts where restaurant employment grew at the same rate as total employment. In the other six cases restaurant employment growth was stronger than total employment growth&#8211;what appear to be the normal pattern. But in four states – Arizona, Colorado, Missouri and Montana – restaurant employment growth was above trend. Massachusetts was the only state with above trend total employment growth and a below trend increase in restaurant employment – what the opponents of the minimum wage would predict.</p>
<p>These comments do not pretend to be conclusive, and is only a quick first look at the data. I do not claim it proves anything. But at best, Massachusetts is the only one of the seven states that appears to support the opponents of the minimum wage argument that it causes minimum wage employment to drop and harms the minimum wage employee. In every other case restaurant employment relative to trend was stronger than total employment growth relative to trend, exactly the opposite of what should happen if minimum wage increases cause minimum wage employment to fall. </p>
<p>It will be very interesting to see more studies of these seven states and of what happens on a national basis after the increase in the federal minimum wage. </p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; </p>
<p>The Commonwealth Fund, a non-partisan think tank, <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/publications_show.htm?doc_id=482678">charts other factors to determine rankings of a country’s health care</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. health system is the most expensive in the world, but comparative analyses consistently show the United States underperforms relative to other countries on most dimensions of performance. This report, which includes information from primary care physicians about their medical practices and views of their countries&#8217; health systems, confirms the patient survey findings discussed in previous editions of Mirror, Mirror. It also includes information on health care outcomes that were featured in the U.S. health system scorecard issued by the Commonwealth Fund Commission on a High Performance Health System.</p>
<p>Among the six nations studied—Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States—the U.S. ranks last, as it did in the 2006 and 2004 editions of Mirror, Mirror. Most troubling, the U.S. fails to achieve better health outcomes than the other countries, and as shown in the earlier editions, the U.S. is last on dimensions of access, patient safety, efficiency, and equity. The 2007 edition includes data from the six countries and incorporates patients&#8217; and physicians&#8217; survey results on care experiences and ratings on various dimensions of care.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/05/15/1198/">Common Dreams</a> indicates that as was found in past surveys, the U.S. is an outlier in terms of financial burdens placed on patients. One–half of adults with health problems in the U.S. said they did not see a doctor when sick, did not get recommended treatment, or did not fill a prescription because of cost. Despite these high rates of forgone care, one-third of U.S. patients spent more than $1,000 out-of-pocket in the past year. There were wide and significant variations in access and waiting times on multiple dimensions across the six countries. </p>
<blockquote><p>Respondents in Canada and the U.S. were significantly less likely than those in other countries to report same-day access and more likely to wait six days or longer for an appointment. At the same time, majorities of patients in New Zealand (58%) and Germany (56%), and nearly half in Australia (49%) and the U.K. (45%), were able to get same-day appointments. Waiting times for elective surgery or specialists were shortest in Germany and the U.S., with the majority of patients in both countries reporting rapid access.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Relative to the U.S. and Canada, the four countries reporting comparatively rapid access to physicians—Australia, Germany, New Zealand, and the U.K.—also had significantly lower rates of emergency room use.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><br />
<blockquote>The authors say that no country emerges as a clear winner or loser. All survey countries experience high rates of safety risks, failure to coordinate care during transitions, inadequate communication, and a lack of support for chronically ill patients. These areas of shared concern, they conclude, will likely require policy innovations that transcend current payment and delivery systems.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The nitwits at the National Review never cease to disappoint us.  Latest case in point is <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWFlM2ZmMmUwNjA5MGEzZTQ1OGMzNWM0YzI2MDBkMDc=">Thomas Nugent</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The last vestiges of monetarism may have been put to rest on June 28, 2007. Wayne Angell, retired member of the Federal Reserve Board, appearing that night on Larry Kudlow’s show on CNBC, observed that the Fed was targeting the federal funds rate and, as such, implied that it could not control the money supply at the same time. Rather, Angell said growth in the monetary aggregates reflected the shifting demand for money, or in other words that the market determined the amount of money by demanding more (or less) of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mind you – I don’t claim to be a monetarist, but I can spot the logical flaw in the following stupidity from Mr. Nugent:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Journal piece also included this revealing Laffer paraphrase on inflation: “The ‘velocity’ of money is soaring as the world demands more of it (money), [Laffer] says, so there is no inflation threat.” In other words, Laffer is implying that the demand for money is dramatically increasing, even though the Fed deserves high marks for controlling the growth in the money supply as measured by the monetary base.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s think this through in terms of the standard IS-LM model noting that money demand depends on part on income and in part on other factors.  If the demand for money rises not because of an increase in income but due to changes in the demand for liquidity (e.g., increased risk aversion), then the LM curve shifts inward absent a change in the money supply.  The resulting higher interest rates tend to lower income along the IS curve.  Of course, the Federal Reserve could and should accommodate such money demand instability to keep interest rates from rising so as to avoid a recession.  But note – velocity declines in this case.</p>
<p>Art Laffer and Thomas Nugent appear to be babbling about an outward shift of the IS curve, which would tend to raise income and the demand for money.  Were we are full employment when the IS curve shifted out, anyone would had bothered to read a 1970 paper by <a href="http://econpapers.repec.org/article/tprqjecon/v_3A84_3Ay_3A1970_3Ai_3A2_3Ap_3A197-216.htm">William Poole</a> would recognize interest rate targeting and accommodations of such increases in money demand would be inflationary. Yet, 37 years later – we have Thomas Nugent babbling about this topic proving that he is as clueless as the rest of the nitwits at the National Review.</p>

                                <p>Reader Susan Webber of <a href="http://www.auroraadvisors.com/">Aurora Advisors</a> has an article in the <a href="http://www.conference-board.org/articles/atb_article.cfm?id=393">Conference Board Review</a>:</p>
<p>No one would dream of calling you a bigot. You’ve been a vocal supporter of diversity, made sure your few fast-track women got good job postings, and have even privately counseled gays who were worried about their chances for advancement. Perhaps some of your close friends are black.</p>
<p>But when you look around, your good intentions and actions have had little impact. Above a certain level in your company, the demographics haven’t changed much in the last decade. Every promotion decision, individually, seemed justified, yet the aggregates would support a charge of bias. And across corporate America, your experience has been replicated at dozens of companies.</p>
<p>Why does this problem persist? Why, despite all the exhortations, training programs, acknowledgment of the business case, and headline-making litigation, is it so hard to get minorities and women into executive ranks? We can talk about the usual suspects: the limitations of the talent pool or pipeline, the fact that minorities of various sorts often don’t get adequate mentoring or lack robust internal networks, that women face work/family conflicts. But these don’t completely explain the phenomenon.</p>
<p>I believe that prejudice is still a factor—yes, even after all these years of soul-searching and anti-discrimination workshops, even in the most enlightened corners of the country. And it’s not about only women and Hispanics and African-Americans&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>[These cases point up a fundamental issue: Are companies making unduly conservative choices based on their beliefs about what makes a successful candidate, when those may not be grounded in fact?&#8230;.</p>
<p>Columbia University professor Amar Bhide coined the phrase “novelty aversion,” to describe how investors shun ventures that are unprecedented—notably, both Federal Express and Cisco found it difficult to secure early funding. It isn’t much of a stretch to extend his logic to hiring and promotion. Both venture capitalists and corporations are in the business of picking winners—the former attractive investments, the latter talented employees&#8230;..</p>
<p>Consider the experience of Oakland A’s general manager Billy Beane, the hero of Michael Lewis’s Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. The baseball industry has always measured players’ skill and achievements by a handful of well-known statistics, but in recent years researchers have questioned the value of those traditional measures. To make the most of a limited budget, Beane used the new principles to sign low-salaried players whom his analysis showed were dramatically undervalued. The result: The team, with one of baseball’s lowest payrolls, has placed first or second in its division each of the last eight years.<br />Here, then, you have a business where the recruiting is unusually transparent, the basic rules have remained unchanged for decades, competitive encounters are in full view, and the incentives for success are high. This would seem to be the perfect environment for developing good decision rules, yet the entire industry was largely wrong.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Read the rest of it. Its a different way of looking at discrimination</p>

After this interview, he brought on Bob Woodward (sometimes a Bush water carrier) balanced but notable liberals Stephen Hayes and David Brooks (OK, the latter two are full time Bush water carriers).  Where to begin – oh wait, I gave it away as I want to go straight to what irked <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/015681.php">Steve Benen</a> (Hayes babbling):</p>
<blockquote><p>I think one of the things we saw this week, and this, this speaks directly to what the vice president told me, is with this &#8211; the release of this NIE we saw a shift in thinking. I think for a long time administration critics had begun to make the argument that really this al-Qaeda threat is overblown, that they misled us into the war in Iraq, they&#8217;re misleading us about the seriousness of the threat from al-Qaeda. And I think what the NIE does, even though in some ways it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s very critical of the administration, is it strengthens the basic case that the administration has been making that al-Qaeda remains a serious threat.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This threw Steve off but he recovered:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have no idea what Hayes is talking about. Or, more precisely, Hayes has no idea what he&#8217;s talking about. Where are these mysterious White House &#8220;critics&#8221; who&#8217;ve been arguing that the al Qaeda threat is &#8220;overblown&#8221;? Seriously, name some prominent Bush detractors who have argued this, in Hayes&#8217; words, &#8220;for a long time.&#8221; I&#8217;m relatively clued into Democratic talking points and I can&#8217;t recall any Democrat or left-leaning political figure ever making this argument in any forum, in any context. Hayes appears to have simply made it up in the hopes of making the NIE appear more favorable for his White House allies. Which segues to the other problem: the NIE doesn&#8217;t strengthen the Bush&#8217;s gang&#8217;s &#8220;basic case&#8221; at all. The White House has said, repeatedly, that thanks to the president&#8217;s leadership, we&#8217;ve destroyed al Qaeda&#8217;s leadership and have the terrorist network on the run. The NIE, in stark contrast, shows the opposite and vindicates what White House critics have been arguing for years. While the president&#8217;s policies have been failing in Iraq, al Qaeda is rebuilding, recruiting, and refilling its coffers &#8211; in large part because of the president&#8217;s failed policies in Iraq. And yet there was Hayes, on national television, making an argument that was clearly false, predicated on straw men and imaginary progress. The mind reels.</p></blockquote>
<p>But me thinks Mr. Hayes was trying to say we Democrats never got the point that we had to toss Saddam Hussein in order to stop Osama bin Laden.  What?  What? Reality says that invading Iraq on 3/19/2003 actually was a major boost to Al Qaeda?  Of course, Hayes realized he could get away with this dishonesty after listening to Woodward being just stupid, nothing, or whatever followed by the following from David Brooks: </p>
<blockquote><p>I would still think he thinks the fundamentals are, are true, that in the long run he’ll be proved right, and that’s kind of remarkable.  I think a lot of us who supported the war, the failures of the war have set off a whole cascade of philosophical thinking.  “Maybe in the Arab world they’re not culturally ready for democracy.  Maybe we don’t have the power to do it, we just don’t have the competency as a government.” It’s created a whole set of serious debates.  It doesn’t seem to have created that in the president’s mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm – the reason we invaded Iraq was to establish a democracy at the point of a gun?  All that 2002 talk about WMDs and Saddam working with Osama bin Laden was something that I just dreamed?  What a load of horseshit?  With all due respect to Senator Feingold – how in hell do you lower yourself to appear on a show run by Tim Russert?  </p>
<p>And the mystery remains why NBC still considers its Sunday mornings owned by Faux News.  Fire Tim Russert, fire him now!</p>

<p><big>Health Care in America 2006 Survey</big></p>
<p><a href="http://www.kff.org/kaiserpolls/upload/7572.pdf">This</a> ABC News/Kaiser Family Foundation/USA Today survey has a lot of interesting information about the public (who incidentally vote) opinion of the Health Care situation in this country. There is a lot of &#8220;survey support&#8221; for some form of Universal Health Care for those supporters here.</p>
<p>But the most telling survey result to me is the juxtoposition of Chart 2 &#8220;How Satisfied are you with each of the following?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqPeZUPDHZI/AAAAAAAAAd4/AiW9jh6K8kg/s1600-h/Sammy%27s+Healthcare+Table.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqPeZUPDHZI/AAAAAAAAAd4/AiW9jh6K8kg/s320/Sammy%27s+Healthcare+Table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Note from cactus&#8230; I took the liberty of modifying Sammy&#8217;s post slightly by putting the results in table form.)</p>
<p>(This depicts a system that is delivering high quality )</p>
<p>With Chart 1 &#8220;Are you satisfied/dissatisfied with&#8230;.</p>
<p>Total cost of health care 18% Satisfied<br />Quality of health care in this country 44% Satisfied </p>
<p>In other words when asked about their <em>own personal health care experience</em> with quality (89% satisfied) and cost (57% satisfied) they are pretty strongly positive, compared to when asked about their <em>perceptions of other peoples health care</em> with quality (44% satisfied) and cost (18% satisfied).</p>
<p>Why the disconnect? Could it be that these perceptions are being created through the liberal and bad news-oriented media, and by politicians seeking to get votes by exaggerating a problem? Are we being conned into turning over our health system to the government?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Regular readers know I disagree with Sammy on a lot of issues. I&#8217;ll post my response in comments.</p>

                                <p>Get this. The problem is that globalization is being threatened, all that good could be lost. The solution; Social Security.</p>
<p>In the July/August issue of Foreign Affairs (published by the Council of Foreign Relations) is an article: <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070701faessay86403-p50/kenneth-f-scheve-matthew-j-slaughter/a-new-deal-for-globalization.html">A New Deal for Globalization </a>by Kenneth F. Scheve is Professor of Political Science at Yale University. Matthew J. Slaughter is Professor of Economics at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.<br />Seems some people somewhere are getting concerned that their pet project might be getting derailed.<br />
<blockquote>“<strong>Advocates of engagement with the world economy are now warning of a protectionist drift in public policy.</strong> This drift is commonly blamed on narrow industry concerns or a failure to explain globalization&#8217;s benefits or the war on terrorism. These explanations miss a more basic point: U.S. policy is becoming more protectionist because the American public is becoming more protectionist, and this shift in attitudes is a result of stagnant or falling incomes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors say they don&#8217;t know why the incomes are falling, that there are no clear answers:<br />
<blockquote>“Over the last several years, a striking new feature of the U.S. economy has emerged: real income growth has been extremely skewed, with relatively few high earners doing well while incomes for most workers have stagnated or, in many cases, fallen. Just what mix of forces is behind this trend is not yet clear, but regardless, the numbers are stark.”</p></blockquote>
<p>First &#8212; “new feature”? Did they not read about the early years of the rise of the industrialists and the division in income way back when? Or is it that they as others took for granted that those making the money via globalizing their operations were going to be nice to those who worked for them at home and share the spoils via wages. Now that would have been a “new feature”. Being nice that is. I know, maybe they just thought everyone could and would outsource their own labor.</p>
<p>Actually, they do know about the old days:</p>
<blockquote><p>“By some measures, inequality in the United States is greater today than at any time since the 1920s.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s the solution to rising protectionism talk? Well, first what is not going to work (read carefully all you who think it&#8217;s just a matter of the populace getting off their intellectually lazy butts):</p>
<blockquote><p>“They must also recognize that the two most commonly proposed responses &#8212; more investment in education and more trade adjustment assistance for dislocated workers &#8212; are nowhere near adequate. Significant payoffs from educational investment will take decades to be realized, and trade adjustment assistance is too small and too narrowly targeted on specific industries to have much effect.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, go to school, get a job is not it. Darn! The solution envelop please, (I&#8217;m so nervous):</p>
<blockquote><p>“The best way to avert the rise in protectionism is by instituting a New Deal for globalization &#8212; one that links engagement with the world economy to a substantial redistribution of income. In the United States, that would mean adopting a fundamentally more progressive federal tax system.”</p></blockquote>
<p>WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!! REDISTRIBUTION?</p>
<blockquote><p>“The notion of more aggressively redistributing income may sound radical, but ensuring that most American workers are benefiting is the best way of saving globalization from a protectionist backlash.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And they said they didn&#8217;t know why “income growth had been extremely skewed.” Well, if they didn&#8217;t know, then how is it they are channeling what was proposed before? They are even referring to it in it&#8217;s historically correct name: New Deal.</p>
<p>The article is very basic thinking and made me wonder why does it take 2 professors writing for 6 pages to state what I was taught under the lesson of morals: that is to share and share alike,<br />And then under the lesson of civics: that is social commons,<br />Then what I learned in history: Ford paying the help and Roosevelt&#8217;s New Deal. Why?</p>
<p>I think the answer is because then they could not write as if skewed income distribution is &#8220;a striking new feature&#8221; and thus suggest as an example of effecting redistribution by targeting the last remaining New Deal concept expressed in the program commonly called Social Security. They specifically rule out that other monster of a New Deal brain storm:</p>
<blockquote><p>“<strong>This does not, however, mean making the personal income tax more progressive, as is often suggested. U.S. taxation of personal income is already quite progressive.</strong> Instead, policymakers should remember that workers do not pay only income taxes; they also pay the FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) payroll tax for social insurance. This tax offers the best way to redistribute income.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well if that is not the ultimate bastardization of the purpose of Social Security. It&#8217;s now proposed to use it as an income redistribution machine.</p>
<p>Think I&#8217;m being to distrusting?</p>
<blockquote><p>“In many ways, today&#8217;s protectionist drift is similar to the challenges faced by the architect of the original New Deal. In August 1934, President Franklin Roosevelt declared:<br />&#8220;Those who would measure confidence in this country in the future must look first to the average citizen. . . .”</p></blockquote>
<p>See, they know the answer.  They know exactly what they are doing here. By the way esteemed professors, stupid is not written on our foreheads.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/07/22/bill-clinton-edelman">Amanda</a> starts her post with something from Bill Clinton as she notes something from ABC News:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clinton said Undersecretary Eric Edelman was “wrong” to send a letter to his wife, Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., criticizing her request for a briefing from Pentagon officials about military plans for a future withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq … In an interview with ABC’s Kate Snow in Lusaka, Zambia, Bill Clinton called Edelman “one of the more ideological holdovers” in the Defense Department. I think it’s wrong to politicize national security,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then Amanda links to <a href="http://thenexthurrah.typepad.com/the_next_hurrah/2007/07/oh-it-was-eric-.html">Mary Wheeler</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>He&#8217;s the bright guy who first suggested leaking Plame&#8217;s identity to rebut Joe Wilson. And, as it turns out, he realized after he suggested to Libby that the information in question may have been classified.</p>
<p>After a June 2003 article about Iraq and the uranium issues that caused concern to Edelman and Libby, Edelman asked Libby whether information about how the Wilson trip came about could be shared with the press to rebut allegations that the Vice president sent Wilson. Edelman testified that Libby responded by indicating that there would be &#8220;complications&#8221; at the CIA in disclosing that information publicly. Ambassador Edelman indicated that he understood that he and Libby could not further discuss the matter because they were speaking on an open telephone line and Edelman understood that this might involve classified information.</p>
<p>Edelman then went on to write a leniency letter, hailing Libby&#8217;s loyalty, with no concern that&#8211;as the guy who first suggested the leak &#8211; the invocation of loyalty reeked of impropriety. You can&#8217;t take someone like that seriously!</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though Edelman put his letter in the public domain, I have heard some of the rightwing water carriers trying to blame Senator Clinton for letting this go public.  Then again &#8211; these same hacks blamed Ms. Plame for her own outing by Dick Cheney and his minions.</p>

<p>The title is from a story by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/business/22refine.html?ex=1342756800&#038;en=812a14004909d5c9&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">Jad Mouawad</a>, which sort of gave me an excuse to summarize some data on retail gasoline prices from <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gaspump.html">this source</a>.  I was looking for an excuse to go there ever since I purchased gasoline in Los Angeles for only $3 a gallon for the first time in a couple of months.  </p>
<p>Our graphs report the real retail price per gallon – where my deflator is the CPI divided by 200, which effectively reports the retail price in terms of 2005QI constant dollars.  The first graph shows that the price today is around twice what it was in early 2000.  We first floated with $3 a gallon gasoline right after Katrina with gasoline prices being on a bit of a roller coaster ever since.  Notice also that the oil components was around $0.75 a gallon in early 2000 and it’s around $1.50 a gallon now.  So oil is about have the story with the doubling of gasoline prices corresponding with the doubling of the oil component.  </p>
<p>But this also means that the sum of non-oil components – taxes, distribution margin, and refinery margin – has also doubled.  Our second graph shows each of these components.  The distribution margin has been quite volatile and at $0.40 per gallon is about twice what it was seven years ago.  But this approximately $0.20 per gallon increased is partially offset by the $0.11 a gallon decline in taxes.  So when discussions turn to refinery margins – this is certainly part of the story behind the increase in gasoline prices.  And over the past two years, the volatility of oil prices appears to be attributable to the volatility of refinery margins.  </p>
<p>Jad Mouawad tries to quickly dismiss one explanation of why refinery margins have increased:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some critics of the industry have theorized on Internet blogs that the squeeze on gasoline and other refined products points to a deliberate effort among oil companies to bolster profits by keeping supplies tight. But experts point out that the companies have little incentive right now to hold back on fuel supplies. “Every refinery would like to run as much crude as possible but they simply can’t,” said David Greely, senior energy economist at Goldman Sachs, who in a recent report compared the drop in domestic refining with an “invisible hurricane.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Mouawad and Greely must have never heard of cartels – a theme we’ll return to.  Rather they see a perfectly competitive market at work:</p>
<blockquote><p>There have been blazes at refineries in Louisiana, Texas, Indiana and California, some of them caused by lightning strikes. Plants have suffered power losses that disrupted operations; a midsize refinery in Kansas was flooded by torrential rains last month. American refiners are running roughly 5 percent below their normal levels at this time of the year. “You have a system that is taxed to the limit,” said Adam Robinson, an energy research analyst at Lehman Brothers. “This is what happens when spare capacity is eroded.” After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita disrupted the nation’s energy lifeline two years ago, oil companies delayed maintenance on many of their plants to make up for lost supplies and take advantage of the high prices. But, analysts say, they are now paying a price for deferring repairs.  As a whole, refining disruptions have been considerably higher than in previous years: they averaged 1.5 million barrels a day in the first quarter, compared with 700,000 to 900,000 barrels a day from 2001 to 2005. In the days after the hurricanes, refiners were forced to briefly halt as many as five million barrels of production.  In 2006, when refiners were still reeling from the impact of the hurricanes, disruptions in the first quarter averaged 1.35 million barrels a day.  Many factors have led to the rise in gas prices, including disruptions in oil supplies from places like Nigeria and Norway. But analysts say the refining bottleneck in North America has been one of the main drivers of higher energy prices this year. The refining crunch has pushed wholesale gasoline prices up 35 percent this year and has contributed to a 23 percent gain for crude oil prices. Oil futures in New York closed at $75.57 a barrel on Friday.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Mother Nature is to blame for the reduction in refinery activity.  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=07&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=refineries_going_down_is_the_o">Dean Baker</a>, however is not so sure: </p>
<blockquote><p>conspiracies do sometimes exist. In the case of energy pricing, we need only go back to the manipulations by those clever boys at Enron that earned the company hundreds of millions of dollars and sent electricity prices soaring in California back in 2001 &#8230; Of course any individual refinery would certainly benefit from pumping out more gas at the current price. But if there was a wink and nod agreement by a few of the biggest companies not to rush repairs, they all would benefit more from the higher prices that result from these refineries being kept off line. My guess is that there is no such agreement and the basic story of refineries being down for needed repairs is true. However, the conspiracy theory folks were right in California in 2001, and the dismissive experts were wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>If an effective refinery cartel were established, the refineries could benefit from withholding supply in order to drive up the wholesale price of gasoline.  But as soon as refinery margins increased, the individual members of the cartel would be tempted to cheat in the form of sub-rosa price cuts in order to gain market share.  A similar view had been put forth with respect to the OPEC cartel by <a href="http://%20/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262011387/lewrockwell">M. A. Adelman</a> many years ago.  Could it be that the recent drop in refinery margins is a sign that this (alleged) cartel is breaking up?</p>
