<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/anatole-kaletsky/2013/02/07/a-breakthrough-speech-on-monetary-policy/" target="_blank">From Reuters</a> comes this comment on the speech.  I haven&#8217;t seen much coverage.<br />
<blockquote>Wednesday night may have marked the “emperor’s new clothes” moment of the Great Recession, in which the world suddenly realizes its rulers are suffering from a delusion that doesn’t have to be humored. That delusion today is economic fatalism: the idea that nothing can be done to break the paralysis in the global economy and therefore that a “new normal” of mass unemployment and declining living standards is inevitable for years or decades to come.</p>
<p>That such economic fatalism is nonsensical is the key message of a truly historic speech delivered on Wednesday by Adair Turner, chairman of Britain’s Financial Services Authority and one of the most influential financial policymakers in the world. Turner argues that a virtually surefire method of stimulating economic activity exists today and that politicians and central bankers can no longer treat it as taboo: Newly created money should be handed out to the citizens or governments of countries that are mired in stagnation and such monetary financing of tax cuts or government spending should continue until economic activity revives.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mark Thoma puts Holtz-Eakin on (figurative) hot seat</p>
<p> As most of the Angry Bear and ataxingmatter readers know, I do not frequently applaud the economic punditry of those freshwater economists who think the way to deal with the problem of failed market fundamentalism policies is to double-down on those failed policies. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noted that we tried that already.  We doubled down on  reaganomics policies of tax cuts/militarization/deregulation/&#038; privatization throughout the Bush regime, and that got us into a witch&#8217;s brew of problems. </p>
<p><strong>Because of that double-down mentality, where the neos told us war was good and greed was good and where we applied the laughable, made-up-out-of-whole-cloth &#8220;Laffer theory&#8221; that told us there was no evil that tax cuts (especially for the rich and big corporations) couldn&#8217;t conquer, the Bush regime very ably turned a budget surplus into a staggering deficit and a financil crisis that would guarantee more deficits and debt before we were done with it. </strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>We ended up with failed (de)regulatory policies.  They</strong> allowed Big Banks and their big moneymakers to speculate their way into phantom billions of profits (all soaked up by the big jefes/big moneymakers).  But instead, we got a near-breakdown of the financial system, that forced all us ordinary taxpayers to subsidize the Big Banks&#8217; losses without getting recompense from the banksters&#8217; earlier oversized payouts. <br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>We ended up with failed tax (cut) policies.  They</strong> cut taxes on big multinational corporations and the ultra rich, based on the claim that those are the &#8220;job creators&#8221; that we should reward.  But instead  they only ended up siphoning off needed revenues from programs that could build infrastructure and support quality education and research.  They privatized education by providing lots of federal loan money to students that went to for-profit schools, only to learn that those schools tend to be traps that don&#8217;t educate but just take money for the profit of the &#8220;education&#8221; business.  They quit funding the stuff we need, so they could subsidize those that didn&#8217;t need it.  And they kept the subsidy up&#8211;for Big Oil, for wealthy decedents&#8211;even when the money was just piling on for those that already had lots of it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what makes the current ultra-partisan Congress and the constant right-wing talk of deficits and debt as justification for stripping the safety net (while still conferring outsize gains on the ultra rich and Big Business) so disgusting.  <strong>The right still  refuses to pay attention to facts and justifies this oft-discredited, clearly wrong-headed market-fundamentalist and class-warfare orthodoxy as &#8220;plain as day&#8221; correct thinking. </strong><br /><em><br /></em> <em>ASIDE:  This seems sort of like the GOP&#8217;s plans for gaining the loyalty of our increasing diverse electorate by being careful to package their mostly white, Friedman-orthodox, oligarchy-favoring policies in the sheep&#8217;s clothing of multicultural spokespersons who avoid the &#8220;tell&#8221; of who they really are and use words that talk about ordinary people as though the policies were actually aimed at benefitting them.  Meanwhile they double-down on their claims that redistribution upward is all about job creation, and condemn those who talk about preserving the safety net by NOT reducing benefits as &#8220;socialists&#8221; who don&#8217;t understand the American way. </em><br /><em><br /></em> <em>The American way they seem to be harking to is the era of the corporate titans of malfeasance that Teddy Roosevelt warned us against, who grabbed the gains of the market place well in excess of their productivity merit and didn&#8217;t give a damn about the rest of us. (Take Leland Stanford and the building of the great western railroads, subsidized by vast land grants and other programs from the federal government.  Stanford was quite willing to let the Chinamen he hired to use their explosive expertise to carve out railroad tunnels live in hunger because he withheld their pay and die because of inadequate safety , but meanwhile he lived a life of luxury supported by his corporate structure that sent all the money supported by the government subsidies his way and none of it theirs.)</em><br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>Douglas Holtz-Eakin is a prime example of doubling down on failed policies by ignoring the facts of recent experience.</strong>  See Holtz-Eakin, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/feb/14/get-us-government-spending-under-control">We have to get US government spending under control</a>, guardian.co.uk (Feb. 14, 2013).  Mark Thoma does a good job of putting him on the hot seat and telling it like it really is.  Read it at <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2013/02/holtz-eakin-tries-to-scare-you-dont-let-him.html">Holtz-Eakin Tries to Scare You. Don&#8217;t Let Him</a>, Economist&#8217;s View (Feb. 14, 2013).  Here&#8217;s an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Holtz-Eakin (in the Guardian essay): &#8220;Debt reduction produces jobs and better economic growth.&#8221;<br />Mark Thoma (in the Economist&#8217;s View take-down): &#8220;[R]eading that last line, he has learned nothing from the failure of the confidence fairy to appear.  Waiting to fix the debt&#8211;a problem driven mainly by health care cost escalation that won&#8217;t become severe for many years&#8211;is not risky, but his advice certainly is.&#8221;<br />***<br />Holtz-Eakin (in the Guardian essay): &#8220;Down with the orthodoxy.  It is time to get the deficit under control.&#8221;<br />Mark Thoma (in the Economist&#8217;s View take-down): &#8220;The notion that we are responding in the same way as in the 60s and 70s, and that we are faced [with] the same type of shock (that require[s] the same types of policies)&#8211;an oil price shock and other large supply-side distrubances from demography that we faced then&#8211;is wrong and he ought to know that.&#8221;&#8230;..&#8221;The &#8216;pundit orthodoxy&#8217; he disses is from Paul Krugman.  Kind of funny, given how wrong Holtz-Eakin has been relative to Krugman &#8230; but Krugman can speak for himself, and has, on how wrong the &#8216;we&#8217;re about to become Greece!!!&#8217; crowd has been.  There is, however, one thing he [Holtz-Eakin] is correct about.  Holtz-Eakin is right to say we shouldn&#8217;t listen to some pundits, especially those like himself who have been so wrong about how events would unfold at every step along the way.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Holtz-Eakin does a lot more in the Guardian article that is just plain bad, such as claiming that the so-called  Affordable Care Act &#8220;entitlement&#8221; will contribute to the so-called &#8220;entitlement problem,&#8221; which will contribute to the &#8220;serious&#8221; problem that the &#8220;deficit orthodoxy&#8221; won&#8217;t acknowledge.  He then hammers on the right-wing orthodoxy&#8217;s pet do-away-with-it-if-we-can projects&#8211;Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, suggesting that &#8220;serious debt reform&#8221; requires &#8220;serious entitlement reform.&#8221;  </p>
<p>As I noted in another recent post, right-wingers like Holtz-Eakin love to talk about safety net programs as &#8220;entitlements&#8221;, whereas they talk about entitlements for the rich and MNEs, such as the percentage depletion allowance, the preferential capital gains rate, and the various subsidies that have handed outsize profits to big banks as though they were rightfully merited acknowledgements of the good those institutions do the rest of us! The talk about these safety net programs, when entering into a right-winger&#8217;s discussion of fiscal issues, is always lopsided.  It is always how we need to cut back on them, and never about how we need to consider if the programs are worthy, the funding currently provided needed or even currently inadequate, and, if the answer is yes, what means make sense, in a sustainable democracy to serve the people, to ensure the ongoing viability of the safety net.  Not reducing benefits but increasing revenues and decreasing rent-profit-taking. </p>
<p>So  Holtz-Eakin fails to acknowledge that actually the Affordable Care Act is a first step in addressing otherwise mushrooming health care costs which occur because we treat health care as a ripe field for rent-seekers to make rentier profits rather than acknowledging (like other advanced countries) that health care is at least a quasi-public good that must be heavily regulated to ensure accessibility.  And like all the right-wingers pushing the hand-wringing worry over deficits for which their own policies are the primary cause, Holtz-Eakin suggests that the core of what we have to do is, quelle surpise, &#8220;spending cuts and deficit control&#8221;, since &#8220;doing nothing or worse, increasing spending, is a profoundly anti-growth strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>This is the doubling-down on failed policy orthodoxy that Americans should reject out of hand.  Spending cuts and efforts at &#8220;deficit control&#8221; that focus on taking away health care and pension benefits from retirees and others dependent on the safety net are perfect prescriptions for disaster.  We aren&#8217;t Greece.  But if the right-wingers like Holtz-Eakin get their way, we will be.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>THEIRS MONEY THAT GOES TO MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY AND I THINK IT IS JUST IS SO  INAPPROPRIATE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT USE THAT AS A TRUST FUND BUT THEY MOVE  IMMEDIATELY TO THE GENERAL FUND  AND STACK UP IOU&#8217;S THAT ARE  SITTING IN A CABINET IN WEST VIRGINIA. </p></blockquote>
<p>What she says should not be allowed to stand and if C-span were half of what it used to be, she would not have had the following go uncorrected.  Thus I leave it to the Angry Bears to correct her here and thus document her ignorance of the subject.  <br /><a href="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/clip/4360645&#038;newclip" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p>I have not watched this lady before.  I could not help but think she is just a more polished version of Sarah Palin. She is totally capable of pulling off what we used to call a &#8220;snow job&#8221; when writing their essay.  </p>

<p>Senator Warren Puts Bank Regulators on Hot Seat</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/index.html?id=82">Elizabeth Warren</a> started out her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F6YkBa_Tig&#038;feature=player_detailpage">questioning of big bank regulators </a>by noting that actual trials, where guilty parties are paraded before juries, information about their wrongdoing is spread over front pages, and everybody is aware that bad guys get punished for their bad deeds has an effect on whether the wrongdoing is committed in the first place. In the case of the big Wall Street banks, however, she notes that they made out like bandits during the speculative orgy that caused the financial system crisis, and yet not a one has paid by being taken to trial in this expressive way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; she says to a group of bank regulators called before her Senate committee, &#8220;about the last few times you&#8217;ve taken the biggest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution">financial institutions</a> on Wall Street to trial. Anybody?&#8221; </p>
<p>The FCC representative, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Curry">Tom Curry</a>, notes that ordinarily they are just trying to move things along and correct deficiencies. Warren interrupts and notes&#8211;&#8220;yes, and you set a price for that&#8230; that&#8217;s effectively a settlement. What I&#8217;m asking is &#8230; when did you last take a financial institution, a Wall Street Bank, to trial? &#8221; Curry &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a fair number of consent orders. We don&#8217;t have to bring them to trial.&#8221; Warren &#8220;I understand that you say you don&#8217;t &#8220;have&#8221; to but my question is when is the last time that you did?&#8221; (No further responsive answer). </p>
<p>(Dan here&#8230;a clip of her at the committee meeting is below the fold)</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The same kind of interchange&#8211;can you identify when you last took Wall Street Banks to trial &#8211;was similarly nonresponded to by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisse_B._Walter">Elisse Walter</a>. Nobody else even offered to comment. Certainly nobody offered a single date for &#8220;last time a Wall Street bank was taken to trial.&#8221; </p>
<p>Warren closed with a comment that made clear that she thought that a very different standard was being applied to Wall Street than is applied to ordinary citizens that commit even minor infractions. She noted that there are District Attorneys every day squeezing ordinary citizens on rather small matters and taking them to trial explicitly to set an example, but &#8220;For Wall Street banks, &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail">too big to fail</a>&#8216; has become &#8216;too big to try [take to trial]&#8217;. That just seems wrong to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>You go, Elizabeth. Without using the words &#8220;class warfare&#8221;, she has made absolutely crystal clear the class warfare problem that exists in our country today, where Wall Street institutions and their chiefs and chief owners get all kinds of protections while the little guy is shaken down for peanuts. As a commenter on the site already noted, if only there were 99 more like her in the Senate&#8230;..</p>

                                <p>By “this,” I mean <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/13/marco-rubio-finances_n_2678744.html">this</a>.  I don’t know, but it sounds to me like some of it is not.  </p>
<p>Wish I could ask Chris Christie, a former (very high-profile) U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey (2001-2008).  He would know.  </p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />UPDATE:  In light of the comments to this post, saying that Florida law allows the type of influence-peddling that Rubio has engaged in (presumably, unless there’s some overt quid pro quo)&#8211;something that the article I linked to does make clear&#8211;I want to clarify what I think may be illegal (i.e., violate federal law, thus my reference to Chris Christie).  From the article: </p>
<div dir="ltr">For Rubio, a rising star in the Republican Party, more government did indeed create more opportunities. As <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/marco-rubios-personal-finances-clash-with-call-for-fiscal-discipline/1129566">the Tampa Bay Times</a> reported during his U.S. Senate run in 2010, it&#8217;s hard to determine with Rubio where politics stops and the private begins:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">As Rubio climbed the ranks, he began to use little-noticed political committees to fund his travel and other expenses and later had a Republican Party of Florida credit card.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">What emerged, records show, is a pattern of blending personal and political spending. Over and over again Rubio proved sloppy, at best, in complying with disclosure requirements.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Virtually broke, the 31-year-old lawmaker began campaigning to be House speaker in 2003 and created a political committee &#8212; Floridians for Conservative Leadership &#8212; to help elect other Republican candidates and curry their support.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">With his wife serving as treasurer, Rubio did not wait for the state to authorize the committee before accepting campaign donations.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The committee listed its address as Rubio&#8217;s home, a modest place he and his wife bought in West Miami in 2002, but reported spending nearly $85,000 in office and operating costs and $65,000 for administrative costs.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Over 18 months, nearly $90,000 went for political consultants, $51,000 went for credit card payments and $4,000 went to other candidates. That&#8217;s less than the $5,700 that went to his wife, Jeanette, much of it for &#8220;gas and meals.&#8221; (Mrs. Rubio does not work and the couple file joint tax returns.)</div>

<p>Some of this sounds to me like taxable (but probably undeclared) income for him and his wife, beyond just his wife’s salary and actual expenses related to the PAC.  The PAC also sounds like it was largely a fraud; its stated purpose was to help elect other Republicans to the state legislature, and I guess some of the consulting was used by or for other candidates, although the article doesn’t make that clear, but just a tiny percentage of the donations were given to other candidates.</p>
<p>But also, two other things the article mentions sound like they violate federal law:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Rubio <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/rubios-campaign-image-belies-history-of-250-million-in-pork-requests/1078548">earmarked money</a> to Florida International University and later got an unadvertised job as a part-time professor at the school. The former school president, Mitch Maidique, said Rubio was &#8220;worth every penny.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">After appropriating millions of dollars to Miami Children&#8217;s and Jackson Memorial Hospitals, Rubio formed a lobby shop and<a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/RubioHerald.pdf"> got contracts</a> with the hospitals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these things sound like things that Jesse Jackson Jr. and his wife <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/jesse-jackson-jr-to-plead-guilty-to-federal-charges-87716.html?hp=f3">were formally charged with yesterday</a>, albeit on a much quieter scale, and some of the other things sound similar in nature, if not scale, to what former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich was convicted of.  </p>

<p>And I think that $80 a barrel production cost is on the low side from our new sources, being more to the $100 a barrel cost level. Past AB posts have followed the concerns of Americans early on, and address market issues where the price per barrel appears to be (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2005/04/oil-impact-on-us-economy.html">Bill McBride</a>) much lower and variable from the Middle East and Texas sweet, and also of the much more limited  quantities than promised in Tom Bozzo&#8217;s <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/08/on-cornucopian-views-of-oil-supplies.html">On Cornucopian Views of Oil Supplies</a> ,  and claims of  (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/06/employmnet-in-oil-gas-drilling.html">Spencer England</a> ) significant jobs growth for the industry.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Chris Martenson: </strong>Well, this is really important. The current story is something along these lines: &#8220;Hey, look at how clever we&#8217;ve been. Because of the magic of technology, we have discovered how to unlock these incredible oil and gas resources that we just didn&#8217;t even know about before.&#8221;<br />When I talk to people who are in the oil business, they say, &#8220;Oh, no, no, we&#8217;ve known about those shale deposits, we&#8217;ve been drilling into and through them for decades. We&#8217;ve had horizontal drilling for decades; we&#8217;ve had fracking for decades. What we haven&#8217;t had is $80-a-barrel oil reliably enough to support us going into those with those technologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what really unlocked those reserves was price. Not technology, not cleverness, not ingenuity. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there&#8217;s a lot of very clever, ingenious stuff going on in those drilling actions, but price was the primary driver here.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Here&#8217;s the thing, though: When more expensive energy comes out of the ground, it means that everything that you use to go get that energy, after a lag, becomes more expensive too. This is doubly compounded by this idea that there&#8217;s less net energy coming from these finds.</p>
<p>They use more energy to get that energy, but that more energy is more expensive. So that feedback loop is already in play here. It simply means that there&#8217;s less to be used as we like elsewhere in the economy.<br />When I look at America&#8217;s apparent energy abundance</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little worried that it&#8217;s been oversold. In particular, the dynamics of depletion that exist in both the tight shale oil and shale gas plays are very different from conventional reservoir depletion dynamics. I&#8217;m concerned that people are accustomed to the old and relatively slow reservoir depletion dynamics and are lulled by the sharp increases in output that these new reservoirs offer without really understanding just how rapidly they fall off as well.<br />Here&#8217;s an example, in the Barnett shale gas play, in one region where they drilled 9,000 wells, there was just this exponential increase in gas output. But then there was no more room for any more wells in that section, and within one single year the gas output from that region with all of those beautiful, technologically marvelous 9,000wells had fallen by 44%. One year!<br />So as long as America can continue to forever increase the number of wells that it&#8217;s completing and bringing online every year, it will be able to maintain rising production from the shale plays. Obviously that&#8217;s an impossibility. You run out of space eventually, you don&#8217;t have enough rigs or talent to drill incrementally more wells each year, or the capital just isn&#8217;t there for some reason. Sooner or later, there are only so many wells you can complete. At that point, we discover that the rapid increases in oil production almost immediately begin to drop. And this is a whole new dynamic. I think we need to build in a little caution for ourselves around this story that seems to be almost completely missing from most mainstream news reports.<br />So really, we&#8217;re on a very elaborate treadmill right now, where as long as we can continue to drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, then we&#8217;ll get an increasing output. I&#8217;m not convinced that that&#8217;s going to happen.<br />There are a number of factors that will cause that to slow. One is environmental concern. Another is, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re going to have the capital to do that forever. A third is that we&#8217;ve already drilled through all of the known sweet spots in these plays, and so we&#8217;re down to the more marginal portions of the main plays. The wells going into the less-than-sweet spots are going to require higher energy prices to break even than did the initial wells. And fundamentally, sooner or later, you just run out of places to put new wells.<br />The biggest problem I have with how the shale story is being sold is it is being used to justify a blind resumption of business-as-usual and I think we really need to be asking some deeper questions of ourselves because eventually even these plays will run out too. I say we should have a distinct and well thought out plan for how we want to use the potential work those resources represent to build ourselves the finest country energy can supply.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In other words, when costs are distributed over a large group, older adults save more than younger adults lose.</p>
<p>Still, many believe that older Boomers can and should pick up the higher tab for their own care. After all, throughout their financial lives, they have been luckier than most: they enjoyed first crack at the employment market when jobs were plentiful, and first dibs on housing when homes were affordable.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Yet in recent years, the economy has not been kind to the rock ‘n roll generation. One in six is now unemployed, and from 2000 to 2011, the average (mean) after-tax income of Americans age 45 to 54 (who are now in their 50s and early 60s) <a href="http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Household-Incomes-by-Age-Brackets.php">plunged by 13.3 percent</a>.</p>
<p>By that measure, the recession has hit them harder than other age groups except Americans aged 15 to 24. Over those years, this cohort should have been enjoying their peak earning years. But as <a href="http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/census/household-income-age-brackets.html?household-income-age-45-54-mean-real-growth.gif">the chart below reveals</a>, they didn’t.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RlS-9tu562Y/UR4aUozDPBI/AAAAAAAABgc/EPUnBjRdAKU/s1600/household-income-by-age-bracket-mean-real.gif" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RlS-9tu562Y/UR4aUozDPBI/AAAAAAAABgc/EPUnBjRdAKU/s320/household-income-by-age-bracket-mean-real.gif"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Yet there’s a trade off: if age rating were abolished, younger adults would be charged more, and some would decide they can’t afford insurance. Bottom line: “the number of uninsured older Americans would be roughly offset by increases in the number of uninsured adults in the two younger age groups (18-34 and 34-44).”</p>
<p>This worries policymakers for two reasons. First, we need young, healthy Americans in the pool to keep insurance costs down. Secondly, if young families decide to forego insurance, many won’t buy separate policies for the children.<br />How do we choose between children and their grandparents?</p>
<p>If we don’t want to ration care, the only rational solution is to bring down the cost by trimming waste in our health care system. This will be difficult. Most of the fat isn’t hanging out on the edges of the steak – it’s marbled throughout in the form of unnecessary treatments and over-priced products. It needs to be removed carefully, with a scalpel. But it can be done.</p></blockquote>

<p> Charitable Contribution Deduction&#8211;Camp Hearings Feb 14</p>
<p> Rep. Camp&#8217;s Ways &#038; Means Committee held hearings today on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization">charitable contribution</a> deduction. To watch the hearings, you can go to <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/hclive09#/recorded/29283882">this website</a>. Camp is planning a tax code rewrite, which he says is intended to lower rates, simplify the code, and curb some tax breaks. <br />Regarding those Camp objectives&#8211;they are not generally the right ones.
<ul>
<li><strong>Lowering rates is the wrong objective</strong>.  We already have very very low tax rates, especially when you consider that we do not have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax">VAT</a>alongside the income tax as most European countries do.  The primary motivation for lowering rates appears to be to cut revenues even more, in another ratcheting up cycle of the GOP &#8220;starve the beast&#8221; game.  Lowering rates allows wealthy taxpayers and corporations to retain more of their profits, when they already garner a higher share of that income than average Americans who toil in their businesses as regular employees.  Lowering rates also results in less revenues and increased borrowing, resulting in higher deficits and higher debt, contributing to the right-wing demand for cutting safety net programs like unemployment insurance, Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. </li>
<li><strong>Simplifying the Code is the wrong objective</strong>.  About 70% of US individual taxpayers do not itemize, meaning that their tax returns are quite simple.  For the 30% of taxpayers who do itemize, the complexity is necessary to prevent scams, manipulation and unreasonable subsidization of those who don&#8217;t need it.  A tax system intended to cover the many complex transactions of today&#8217;s globalized economies cannot be simple without being naive. </li>
<li><strong>Curbing some tax breaks is a good idea. </strong> But it should be more than &#8220;some&#8221; and it should be vigorously done to shift the tax burden towards the upper class and business and away from those in the lower and lower-middle income distributions.  The tax breaks that should be curbed are the ones that are most regressive in nature&#8211;i.e., the ones that provide the majority benefit to the very rich.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hearing today included lots of representatives of charities who were arguing their interest&#8211;keeping the tax-incentivized flow of money coming.  The typical argument from charities is that the tax deduction is necessary to incentivize the transfer of money to charities.  If it weren&#8217;t there, the argument goes, rich people might not give at all, or at least not nearly so much money. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s not a whole lot of empirical evidence to back this up.  On the one hand, there are studies showing that  non-rich people give much more of their limited assets away, proportionately, than the richest people (though of course it amounts to much less in absolute dollars), and many of them don&#8217;t get any break at all because they don&#8217;t itemize. Furthermore, rich people like the names-on-gold-plates-on-opera-house-chairs a heck of a lot, too.  Maybe they give most of the money they give because of the status, the recognition, the remembrance-in-perpetuity, and to get to attend the events they&#8217;ve sponsored, which are usually the kinds of cultural events that they enjoy (opera, ballet, elite art museums, etc.).  Does what a rich person says about why he gives hold a lot of weight in this debate?  I&#8217;d argue it should not, since those who give typically want to be thought of as important philanthropists and not as status-greedy opportunists who are just giving the minimum amount to get their name and face plastered all over the New York Times&#8230;..</p>
<p>Does the tax incentive come into play in determining how much a person will give?  Indubitably.  But it isn&#8217;t clear that people who want to give $20 million to their alma matter wouldn&#8217;t do so even without the charitable contribution deduction!  All that put together suggests that the deduction is highly inefficient.  Most rich people would give money anyway to the things that bring them prestige and status and recognition and that accomplish what they want to accomplish now that they are rich and can afford to spread money around.</p>
<p>In addition to the inefficiency of the charitable contribution deduction&#8211;at least in amounts above some reasonable amount to allow to those who are NOT in the top quintile (say, 10%  of  adjusted gross income), there is also the problem that the deduction is primarily beneficial to the very wealthy.  They pay tax at the highest rates (well, except when the system doesn&#8217;t work well because they have mostly preferentially taxed capital gains) and they get the most bang from the buck for the dollars they contribute.  They invariably itemize, whereas most lower-bracket taxpayers do not.  They give in ways that gives them prestige (there is really a quid pro quo for much of their giving, though it may not be financial).</p>
<p>Another complaint from charities and wealthy donors is that the absence of a charitable contribution deduction will result in the government just taking all that money that would have otherwise gone to the charity, because of higher taxes.  The implication is that such a result is disastrous, putting the recipients of the charity&#8217;s charitableness at risk.  But the truth is otherwise.  The government may be more likely to support the poor and downtrodden than the wealthy are through charitable donations.  How many wealthy are making contributions to Museums and Opera Houses and Elite Universities, versus a local homeless shelter or similar programs for the needy?  And the decision of what to support, when made by a democratically chosen government, should more accurately reflect the will of the people than the decision of the one (wealthy) donor who gets the tax benefit of a deduction (though of course in these days of partisan gridlock and GOP obstructionism, that is regretably less true).  Shouldn&#8217;t democracies favor taxation and redistribution via program selection over subsidizing the wealthy&#8217;s favored charities?</p>
<p>So some new, reasonable limits on the charitable contribution deduction make a lot of sense from the perspective of democratic egalitarianism.   My suggestion would be to limit the deduction to  10% of the adjusted gross income reported on the tax return. (Ideally, such a modification to the deduction would be accompanied by a rethinking of the estate tax, to limit the amount that can be passed on to heirs without tax to an amount that more or less approximates the average estate of a taxpayer in the fourth quintile of the distribution.)</p>
<p>What about other changes that would be easier to pass and make lots of sense? 
<ul>
<li>Prime amongst them would be the elimination of the fair-market-value deduction (rather than basis) for contributions of certain properties.  This is a sheer giveaway to the wealthy that cannot be justified.  It allows zero basis stock where there is no remaining unrecovered capital investment to be contributed and yield a deduction for the full value, whereas if the person sold the stock, they would at least have to pay capital gains tax on the value.  This provision should simply be deleted from the Code.  That&#8217;s one simplification that would actually result in more fairness. </li>
<li>Another area to tighten is the rules governing private foundations, to prevent the kinds of abuses (where 20 family members receive exorbitant salaries) that give charities a bad name. </li>
<li>And Congress should eliminate the tax giveaway to large corporations (enacted in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1976">Tax Reform Act of 1976</a>) that permits them an enhanced deduction for donations of excess inventory&#8211;a deduction in excess of their cost basis and for more than the value of the inventory.  It&#8217;s not clear that the deduction incentivizes any additional donations&#8211;if a corporation has excess inventory, it will either give it away (which can serve a significant PR function) or sell it at fire-sale prices (which can serve a negative PR function).  IN most cases, it would likely give it away without the enhanced deduction.  Of course, instead of urging Congress to eliminate the large busienss excess inventory special treatment, small businesses (mainly, S corporations with wealthy shareholders) are whining about how tough a time they have and arguing that they should be given a &#8220;level playing field&#8221; by letting them get the enhanced deduction too.  See NAEIR President Gary Smith&#8217;s comments, below (in email).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>  Congressman Schock and Mr. Smith agree that the bill [H.R. 2592, introduced in the 112th Congres by Schock] would greatly benefit the small business community by establishing parity for S corporations and other small businesses and as such a level playing field with larger regular corporations.  In addition to the principle of fairness inherent in this legislation in the tax benefits it extends to the small business community on par with larger corporations, Mr. Smith notes that <em>“The impact of this legislation must be understood on the grassroots level: promoting </em><strong><em>greater collaboration between businesses and charities</em></strong><em> at the local level.”</em>  In brief, several million struggling small businesses and millions of individuals served by our nation’s charities would benefit through previously unavailable access to a wide variety of free donated products.  (NAEIR email release Feb 14, 2013)<br />Not surprisingly, NAEIR is busy promoting the &#8220;enhanced&#8221; tax deduction (for up to two times the value of the excess inventory) to businesse&#8211;see <a href="http://www.naeir.org/blog/business-taxes-a-deduction-you-might-not-be-aware-of/">here</a>.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">Yesterday, both sides drew their battle lines in the coming war over the minimum wage. After Obama called for a minimum wage hike in his State of the Union speech, House Republicans dug in against it, casting their opposition as grounded in concern for the plight of low wage workers. John Boehner <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/boehner-shoots-down-obamas-minimum-wage-hike">asked</a>: “Why would we want to make it harder for small employers to hire people?”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/14/the-morning-plum-dems-to-use-minimum-wage-against-gop-in-2014/">Dems to use minimum wage against GOP in 2014</a>, Greg Sargent, Washington Post, this morning</div>
<p>To me, one of the great frustrations in Obama’s failure during most of his first term to communicate, effectively or at all, the basic premises of Keynesian and other liberal economics-related arguments (including on healthcare) was his apparent resistance to mentioning&#8211;early, often, or ever&#8211;specific other countries’ successes or failures that illustrate the point. </p>
<p>But there’s no time like the present for him and the congressional Dems to start to do do this, by maybe mentioning these facts: that Australia’s minimum wage is $15 U.S. and that its unemployment rate is 5.4%, and that the United States has (surprise!) the largest gap between the minimum wage and the median wage of any advanced economy in the world.</p>
<p>I learned those facts yesterday when I read Washington Post columnist <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-raise-the-minimum-wage/2013/02/06/34857264-7066-11e2-8b8d-e0b59a1b8e2a_story.html">Matthew Miller’s Feb. 6 column</a>.  He mentioned it and linked to it in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-obamas-hollow-speech/2013/02/13/d928c944-75a5-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_story.html">his column yesterday</a> about Obama’s State of the Union address.  In yesterday’s column, he suggested seemingly, facetiously, that it was his February 6 column that had persuaded Obama to include a minimum-wage-hike proposal in his address.  But after reading the earlier column, I suspect that it was not only what convinced Obama to make the call but also was what caused Obama to even think of it.  </p>
<p>Both of Miller’s columns say that the $9/hr. figure that Obama proposed in his speech would still leave the minimum wage at $1.68 below what the value of the minimum wage was in 1968.  The first column, Miller also mentions that several CEOs of large corporations support a rise in the minimum wage and that a prominent conservative, the editor of American Conservative magazine, suggests raising the minimum wage to $12/hr.  Of course, the Republicans will showcase their own CEOs, and some small-business owners, to support their own position.</p>
<p>Which is where Australia comes in.  Or at least where invoking it should come in. The special beauty of using Australia as an example&#8211;whether in support of an increase in the minimum wage or in refuting the Obamacare-is-socialism/makers-vs.-takers mantra&#8211;is that few Americans associate Australia with, um, socialism.  They associate it instead with free-enterprise economics and a high standard of living.  And soon, hopefully, also with a higher minimum wage that corresponds to a low unemployment rate.  </p>
<p>Maybe Marco Rubio and John Boehner could get a travel discount <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/02/marco-rubio-needs-to-travel-more.html">if they booked their reservations</a> together. </p>
