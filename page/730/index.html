                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Its Tuesday.  Which means yesterday the NRO gave us another <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDFlMzUwODVkOWEzZGIyYjI2OWFmMTE5NGQ3Mjg4Mjk=">Kudlow kolumn</a>.  His latest has this gem:</p>
<blockquote><p>A middle-class tax cut to help families and small businesses would also work wonders. This can be done by collapsing the three middle-income tax brackets of 15 percent ($15,650), 25 percent ($63,700), and 28 percent ($128,500) into one 15 percent bracket.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/05in07tr.xls">This table from the IRS</a> tells us that in 2005, the top 5% of taxpayers had incomes of $152,048 or up.  The top 10% had incomes of $105,958 and up.  Thus, someone earning $128,500 is somewhere between the top 10% and top 5% when it comes to income.  That, to Kudlow, is middle-income. </p>
<p>What about at the bottom?  Well, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/05in11si.xls">this other table from the IRS</a>, which tells us that in 2005, 27.5% of all taxpayers had incomes below $15,000.  They wouldn&#8217;t get helped by this proposal of Kudlow&#8217;s. </p>
<p>So Kudlow&#8217;s middle income tax cut would help everyone except the bottom  27.5%, and the top seven or eight percent.  Actually, strike that&#8230; the top seven or eight percent would benefit too&#8230;  the first $128,500 of their income would now be taxed at only 15%.   Right now, as per Kudlow&#8217;s numbers, they pay $2,348 on the first $15,650, $12,013 on the next $48,050, and $18,144 on the next $64,900, for a total of $32,504 on their first $128,500 &#8211; or about a 25% effective rate.  Kudlow&#8217;s proposal would mean their income taxes would drop to $19,275&#8230;</p>
<p>In other words, their income taxes would drop by $13,229.  Someone who makes $13,229 a year, of course, would get nothing.  </p>
<p>Which leads me to a comment and a modest proposal.  The comment&#8230; Kudlow calls it a &#8220;middle-class tax cut&#8221; but it seems to be clearly an attempt to get just about everyone&#8217;s tax rate down to the rate paid by those with lowest incomes.  Why not have the honesty to simply call it what it is: a flat tax?</p>
<p>But now, a modest proposal for how Kudlow can improve his tax cut.  See, he can collapse the rates for incomes between $15K and $128.5K&#8230; but why not raise the rates on the those who make below $15K?  Because if cutting taxes on people with middle and high incomes &#8211; excuse me, apparently they&#8217;re all middle-income folks to Kudlow &#8211; will encourage them to do more of what they&#8217;re doing, raising rates on those making less than $15K will encourage them to get off their behinds and earn more money to get into the lower tax brackets, right?  Because the current policy of pandering to the poor isn&#8217;t doing it.  I&#8217;d say 90% is a good starting point &#8211; a nice bit of encouragement, and what&#8217;s really cool is that he could then cut tax rates below 15% on income between $15K and $128.5K to make the whole thing revenue neutral.</p>

                                <p>Yesterday I noted that there is a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/blog-carnival-soliciting-entries-on.html">blog carnival on Social Security</a> coming up, and I suggested that readers might like to to write some guest posts on the topic which I would then post and submit to the blog carnival.  Even the comments to that post were very instructive &#8211; I&#8217;m going to cut and paste some pieces (and hopefully encourage commentators flesh these out into full posts):</p>
<p>Bruce Webb notes that the Social Security going bust theme depends on productivity being very low:</p>
<blockquote><p>No one has explained to my satisfaction why a mid-range estimate of 2.2% Real GDP in 2013 is a good faith projection. As a possible outcome certainly but is there really a 50% chance that the economy will actually perform worse than that? Forever? In fact no one has even tried to justify this number. For one thing it makes hash out of tax cut claims.</p>
<p>If someone came to me and suggested that it would be very optimistic to assume that the economy in the next 45 years could match growth rates of the last 45 years and that 3.3% Real GDP should be a ceiling, 2.8% should be a midrange and 2.3% a floor I might grumble a little because all of those are low by historical standards 2007 Report: <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR07/V_economic.html#wp192078">V.B2 column 4</a>.  As it is I am being told that over the fairly short term that the ceiling is 2.8%, the midrange is 2.2%, and the floor 1.6% and sinking. Well I cry bullshit, whatever happens near term no one really believes that 2.2% Real GDP number.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coberly adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are some who think all this can be finessed simply by taking SS money and investing it in &#8220;the market.&#8221; They are wrong. Certainly they have made no case that does not depend on the illusion that what you can do with a calculator you can do in real life. Hint: where do you suppose the money to pay big dividends, or higher stock prices, comes from?</p>
<p>The answer would be growth&#8230; so your challenge is to show convincingly how SS money will contribute to meaningful growth&#8230;and how you will feed the elderly while you are doing this.</p>
<p>but to restate the bottom line: the Trust Fund is NOT Social Security. It can go exponential as Bruce expects, paying not only for SS but for the rest of the government, or it can be stolen by a flying saucer. SS is simply a plan to pay for the elderly by having saved their own money when they were working.</p></blockquote>
<p>M. Jed disagrees&#8230;.  he points out that he doesn&#8217;t argue that SS is going bust, but he does think privatization can help:</p>
<blockquote><p>So with real GDP growth of 2.0-2.5%, ( I believe this is the Intermediate cost 75-year assumption) it isn&#8217;t unreasonable to assume real domestic equity returns can reach 6%. Thus with 2-3% inflation, nominal returns would be 8-9%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Terry Gardiner also looks at privatization, and excerpts from a letter he sent to his congresscritter:</p>
<blockquote><p>My own experience as a CEO of a company with hundreds of employees trying to invest their 401K in the market cast grave doubts on the viability of millions of Americans individually investing private accounts. The average employee works very hard at his job, has little time to become a genius investor, examine thousands of investment options, track the markets and project macro economic trends impacting investments. Most employees end up being very frustrated, gyrating from one strategy to the next and recording earnings below the market average. Investment fees and costs end up being a very large percentage of the total earnings of the 401k owner. There are many investment professional who take advantage of individual investors – the investment professional takes no risk. It would be much safer and meet the retirement goals of millions of Americans, if independent, accountable experts with no conflict of interests were used to invest the private accounts. The goal of private accounts investing in the stock market can be achieved, but without unnecessarily risking the irreplaceable retirement of American citizens.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its clear that there are a lot of smart people who have put a lot of thought into this.  To the folks that I excerpted, and to others&#8230;  if you write it the odds are extremely high I will post it.</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-12-10-great-lakes-debate_x.htm">The Great Lakes Water Resources Compact</a> was signed last December by the governors of the eight states that border the lakes — Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York — and the premiers of the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario. The agreement requires approval of state legislatures before it is sent to Congress for final approval. Ohio&#8217;s Legislature is expected this week to become the first to approve the pact. New York&#8217;s may approve it later this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a water grab,&#8221; says Sam Speck, director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. &#8220;It&#8217;s a commitment to protect a resource in the face of climate change and other challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Great Lakes contain nine-tenths of the nation&#8217;s fresh water and supply drinking water to 30 million people in Chicago, Toronto, Buffalo and elsewhere. The lakes are an economic engine and the cultural centerpiece for much of the upper Midwest. But the fragile ecology of the lakes has suffered from pollution, invasive species of fish and the diversion of water to support Chicago and other cities.</p>
<p>The new agreement would control who can use the water and how much.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.ouraynews.com/Articles-i-2007-12-19-169065.112113__Grand_water_plan">Grand Water Plan Downstream Pact&#8221;</a> Last week&#8217;s agreement was truly significant, the most important changes since the first compact was drafted in 1922. And the manner in which it came about — no real winners or losers, but a cooperative regional effort to solve problems — was as surprising as it was refreshing.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is truly an historic moment,&#8221; said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne. &#8220;Celebrate this day. This is huge.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new water deal has four basic elements to manage the water in the Colorado River and its tributaries.</p>
<p>1. The new guidelines establish rules for shortages – specifying who will take reductions and when they take them. This is essential for prudent water planning in times of drought.</p>
<p>2. The new operational rules for Lake Powell and Lake Mead will allow these two massive reservoirs to rise and fall in tandem, thereby better sharing the risk of drought.</p>
<p>3. The new guidelines establish rules for surpluses, so that if the basin is blessed with ample runoff, the Department of the Interior will have rules to distribute the extra water.</p>
<p>4. The new rules will address the ongoing drought by encouraging new initiatives for water conservation.</p>
<p>Previously, the compact divided the states into Upper and Lower Basins, with each to get equal allotments of 7.5 million acre feet per year. But some believe that the 1920s was a wet period, and the allocations were based on an assumption of 16.4 million acre in the basins. Today, the long-term average annual water flow is assumed at 13.5 million acre feet, so it is no surprise that increased demand, because of rampant population growth, had increased interstate tensions. The river provides water to utilities that serve 30 million people. (The eight states in the Southwest water sharing area).</p></blockquote>
<p>I was hoping STR could post on the Great Lakes compact, and the very direct agreement not to ship water out of the current boundaries.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2008_01_06_archive.html#4376492115909414609">Atrios</a>, we learn that <a href="http://www.redstate.com/stories/miscellanea/redstate_has_a_real_need_for_your_help">RedState</a>  is in trouble because its not a liberal blog&#8230; or something.</p>
<blockquote><p>When we started RedState in May of 2004, we used a website program called Scoop — the same program a lot of similar sites on the left used. But, as the number of visitors to our site grew, Scoop kept crashing on us.</p>
<p>If we’d been a liberal website, we would have been able to fix the problem quickly and relatively cheaply.  The online left loves Scoop. Unfortunately, there weren’t really any conservative Scoop developers out there to help us.  We kept crashing and were out of money.  We had to close down or take drastic action.  </p>
<p>Well, we didn’t close down. We ditched Scoop and moved to the best alternative at the time, a program called Drupal.  But, in accomplishing the switch, budget constraints forced us to sacrifice some popular site features in order to alleviate the strain on our overused servers.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we always regarded those “downgrades” as temporary, and we hoped to restore the eliminated features – and to add new and even better ones – as soon as we could afford to.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we still can’t afford to. But we’re convinced that America can afford even less to have us operating at anything less than our absolute peak potential during the coming presidential election season.</p>
<p>So we’ve decided to move ahead with our upgrades without delay, and despite not having the cash on hand – hoping and praying that RedState.com readers like you will help us make up the shortfall with a generous donation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve included more than I needed to so there&#8217;s no suggestion that somehow I&#8217;ve taken this out of context.  Frankly, I blame George W. Bush&#8230; with deeper tax cuts Scoop would have fixed itself.  But in all seriousness&#8230;  as part of the Vast Left Wing Conspiracy, I was wondering &#8211; am I supposed to be getting some freebies of some sort?  </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update&#8230; edited the first and last paragraphs slightly.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update 2&#8230;</p>
<p>In comments, One Salient Oversight notes:<br />
<blockquote>Actually the funny thing is that both Scoop and Drupal are open source software. You&#8217;d think with Redstate&#8217;s love of capitalism that they would&#8217;ve used proprietary software.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nikki points out that the letter sent by Erick from RedState to readers (text at the Atrios link in the post) is actually more damning, beginning with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The bad news: our liberal &#8220;friends&#8221; – you know, the ones who believe so strongly in free speech and open debate – have done what they can to prevent us from making these improvements, so that our influence will be minimized just as we head into the 2008 presidential primary season.</p>
<p>No, our Blue State buddies haven’t succeeded in stopping us from improving our website. But they’ve made it more difficult and more expensive – which is why I’m coming to you for help.</p></blockquote>
<p>Howard sends us to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/comments/2008/1/7/104733/5912/451#c451">Kos</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Want to know the worst of it?</p>
<p>I had offered RedState a technology swap &#8212; they could have all of our improvements if their developer helped with some patches and whanot. I saw this as a way to spread out the costs of improving the platform amongst various sites.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t fit their narrative of being &#8220;censored&#8221; by those crazy liberals.</p>
<p>So in other words, as ludicrous as their charge was &#8212; that they were being censored because no liberals offered to help them &#8212; IT&#8217;S NOT EVEN TRUE!</p>
<p>Aside from that, didn&#8217;t Eagle Publishing buy them? The Regnery folks have a lot of money.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>We&#8217;re starting to see a new campaign by the Republicans about a cut in the corporate tax rates.</p>
<p>There is a good case to be made for corporate tax cuts.  This is especially true if the objective is to increase business fixed investment.  After all corporations account for over 80% of business fixed investment as compared to only about 11% by partnerships, S-corps, etc that are subject to the individual tax code. ( non-profits account for the remainder)  If you want to stimulate capital spending you should give the money to the economic sector that actually does the investments.  But this is also the problem with the  standard supply side argument that cutting taxes at the individual level really does not give you much bang for the buck.</p>
<p>In todays world of international competition there is also the problem of international competition to consider.  For example KPMG did a big study of this last year that is getting a lot of attention. That study had this chart that compared US corporate tax rates to comparable tax rates in other countries.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R4KFeca1zKI/AAAAAAAAAE0/I0PZlnzlcEs/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R4KFeca1zKI/AAAAAAAAAE0/I0PZlnzlcEs/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>You can find the study at:
<p>http://www.kpmg.com/NR/rdonlyres/D8CBA9FF-C953-45FA-940A-FAAC86729554/0/KPMGCorporateTaxRateSurvey.pdf</p>
<p>The study shows that other countries have been lowering rates while the US rate has remained at 40%.  They argue that the US needs to lower corporate rates to offset other countries cutting taxes to below the US rate.</p>
<p>But the problem with this comparison is that the US corporate tax rate is not really 40%.  The<br />effective US corporate tax rate is really only 25%.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R4KGXsa1zLI/AAAAAAAAAE8/Q3eNP-DjSXQ/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R4KGXsa1zLI/AAAAAAAAAE8/Q3eNP-DjSXQ/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The US has a long record of cutting the effective tax rate and it is now only half of what it was in 1950.</p>
<p>My question is why do they have to be so dishonest about it?  There is a valid argument for lower corporate taxes.  Why do they feel they have to publish studies that are so fundamentally biased that if people knew the facts it would undercut their argument.  I guess they have such a low opinion of the business press and other newspaper reporters that they are confident that reporters will never fact check the study.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/recycle/recycle.pdf">The Wellesley Dump</a> has expanded even more to date. It is not my town, but is remarkable.</p>
<blockquote><p>Wellesley’s recycling program was started in 1971 by local environmentalists and the Department of Public Works when the town incinerator failed to meet air emission standards. Unlike many of the earlier recycling centers around the nation, Wellesley’s is still in business andis thriving. Located at the town Recycling and Disposal Center, the operation has grown from collecting materials in 55-gallon drums to using 40-cubic-yard, open-top,transfer-haul containers plus a dual ram baler. It is now run by the town public works department and consists of a recycling facility, transfer station, and yard waste composting site.Wellesley has never had municipal curbside garbage collection. Its residents—at least 83% of them—take their refuse to the Recycling and Disposal Facility (RDF),which is free only to residents.</p>
<p>The center is proud of its park and social gathering setting.Picnic tables, well-maintained lawns, trees, flowers, and a circular drive contribute to the site’s popularity for GirlScout cookie sales as well as political events.The center is also unique in its wide acceptance by townspeople and its dedicated staff. Further, the Wellesley recycling center sponsors a recycling education program aimed at all Wellesley residents, including a curriculum for third graders in Wellesley public and private schools.“Recycle. Join the Team” is its theme. The center also actively promotes other recycling in the community. For instance, it helps spread the word about community-sponsored rummage sales.At the recycling center, a wide range of services can be found: a redemption center for bottles donated as asource of revenue for the center, a yard waste composting operation, and Goodwill depots. The book exchange is also a popular gathering place for residents.</p>
<p>Obstacles Overcome: The Wellesley recycling program works, and it has always worked! Nonetheless, there are the complaintsthat recycling takes too much time and that separate storagebins take up too much space in the home. To overcomethese complaints, the center relies on its information and education program. Not only does the public works staff go to the schools, they provide community presentations and promote recycling regularly.</p>
<p>875 pounds of re-cycling material per person for the year was the goal, and 892 pounds was the end of the year measure for 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now we know that Annie says for every barrel of stuff we dump as consumers there has been 70 barrels of stuff thrown away in the process of making the stuff.</p>
<p>I assume this does not include the <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2122832/">stuff stored in lockers</a> all over the country and not in use. Every American can stand shoulder to shoulder in the currently constructed storage space, and is one of the fastest growing industries today. This is called stored stuff, and can be read about in the next post.</p>
<p>Then there is the very profitable &#8216;ship your stuff&#8217; to a Chinese labor intensive &#8216;recycle your stuff&#8217; (now considered unAmerican) places to the port of Giyu, China <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2002/02/25/computer-waste.htm">as reported in USA Today</a>. Trash picking at a profitable level, and insures that vessels do not have empty cargo holds on the three part journey of the US-China trade dependency. Reminds me of jolly England of old. And no healthcare costs to worry about, and no WTO to worry about. It is reassuring that no individual rights are violated as none have been established.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Recycling/Problem-With-Plastics5jun03.htm">Plastic containers</a> get turned into new products at a much lower rate than glass bottles or aluminum cans. The can you recycle today, for instance, will make its way back to the supermarket shelf in just six weeks. Because of health concerns, a plastic bottle will never become another plastic bottle. Recyclers often have a hard time making ends meet because the demand from manufacturers for recycled plastic — and, consequently, the money paid for it — is considerably less than for virgin material. Oh-plastics are not considered hazardous material. Currently there is little market for #3 to #7 plastics either.</p>
<p>Wellesley is rightfully proud of its dump. Citizen participation is quite amazing and helps provide the labor for sorting materials to a remarkable degree. Some of the other stories reminds me of how we do not pay for the cheap toasters and such from our major trading ally. More than we know.</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a hedge against water shortages and population growth, Orange County has begun operating the world&#8217;s largest, most modern reclamation plant &#8212; a facility that can turn 70 million gallons of treated sewage into drinking water every day.The new purification system at the Orange County Water District headquarters in Fountain Valley cost about $490 million and comprises a labyrinth of pipes, filters, holding tanks and pumps across 20 acres.<br /><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-reclaim2jan02_jts86mnc,1,5223619.photo" target="win_34523149"></a><br />Almost four years after construction began, the facility is now purifying effluent from a neighboring sewage treatment plant run by the Orange County Sanitation District, a partner in the venture.The finished product will be injected into the county&#8217;s vast groundwater basin to combat saltwater intrusion and supplement drinking water supplies for 2.3 million people in coastal, central and northern Orange County.But before that can be done, state health officials must certify that the reclaimed water meets drinking water standards. Officials expect the approval to be granted before opening ceremonies Jan. 25.&#8221;Our sources from the delta and the Colorado River are becoming unavailable,&#8221; said Michael R. Markus, general manager of the water district. &#8220;This will help drought-proof the region and give us a locally controlled source of water.&#8221;Last month, for example, a federal judge in Fresno ordered a 30% reduction in fresh water pumped from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to protect the tiny delta smelt, a threatened species. The region, which is facing myriad environmental problems, is the hub of California&#8217;s water system.If the reclamation plant&#8217;s full potential is realized, officials say, up to 130 million gallons a day could be added to the county&#8217;s fresh water supply, lessening the region&#8217;s dependence on outside sources.Basically, the facility takes treated sewage, which would have been discharged into the sea, and runs it through an advanced filtration system.</p>

                                <p>Just out of curiosity &#8211; why is the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010303582.html?hpid=moreheadlines">President considering more economic stimulus</a> at this point?  Let me rephrase the question&#8230;  why is the economy in a state where even rational people are talking about the need for stimulus only a few years after we&#8217;ve had large individual income tax cuts, big cuts on taxes on repatriated corporate income, and continued year after year tax cuts on the estate tax.  And let&#8217;s not forget that the Fed has bent over backward to help GW.  Take a look at real interest rates since GW took office &#8211; has any president gotten anything even remotely resembling this sort of help since stagflation was vanquished?  </p>
<p>So in plain English, we&#8217;ve had a heck of a lot of what we&#8217;re told is fiscal stimulus and a heck of a lot of monetary stimulus since GW took office.  Off the top of my head, the only administration with any comparable combination of tax cutting and help from the Fed was the JFK/LBJ administration&#8230; but JFK/LBJ produced the fastest growth rates of any administration since FDR left office, with an annualized growth rate in real GDP per capita which last time I checked in the middle of last year  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">more than twice that of GW</a>.  Sure, there were some good quarters last year, but nothing is going to make up that difference in performance.</p>
<p>And yet there&#8217;s still trouble.  This administration (and its cheerleaders) have been wrong about everything they&#8217;ve told us about the economy.  They promised rapid growth and to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">pay down the debt</a>.  In 2007, the surplus was going to be so big that there wouldn&#8217;t be enough retiring bonds to pay off.  By 2010, debt was to be 6.5% of GDP.  That was their first economic plan.</p>
<p>A recession came &#8211; they blamed it on Clinton and 9/11 and pushed through tax cuts, and more tax cuts.  It was a light recession&#8230;  short and shallow.  But apparently enough so that debt would grow rather than shrink, despite all the help from the Fed.  And for some reason, growth was anemic.  So they pushed more tax cuts.  And growth was still anemic. Eventually, in mid &#8211; 2003, the economy started to pick up again.  There was much trumpeting of horns and pontificating and gloating.  We&#8217;ve had average real growth for a few years plus a big run-up in the debt, and now we&#8217;re back to worrying about a downturn again?  Now?  So soon after their wonderful remedy produced what Kudlow called the Goldilocks economy?  </p>
<p>Which raises a question&#8230; what are they going to blame it on now?  Clinton has been out of office too long, its been more than six years since 9/11, Congress has given them just about everything they wanted, and the Fed could not be more cooperative.  (In fact, anyone could see the Fed helped so much for so long, it created its own problem&#8230;  which is where we are at this point.)  So what is left?  Why the very short, very sub-par expansion?   If its not Clinton, and not 9/11, and not the Fed, and not some big problem from abroad, then what?   Random chance?  For no particular reason, this happened now?  Or is it their economy, their policies?</p>
<p>My guess is that they&#8217;ll find some other reason, something other than their own actions and remedies and prescriptions.  Because as far as GW and his cheerleaders are concerned, this situation gives them an excuse to peddle some more of their failed remedies and inane prescriptions.  After what we&#8217;ve seen since January of 2001, a decent man would not go before the American public with a smirk on his face and tell us we need more tax cuts.  But GW will.  And decent people would not see the smirk and hear the call for more of the same and support it.   But the cheerleaders will.</p>

<p>Update&#8230; the question came up in comments&#8230;  why the difference in performance between JFK/LBJ and GW if there are similarities.  First, the similarities aren&#8217;t quite that high&#8230; JFK/LBJ didn&#8217;t have anywhere near as much help from the Fed as GW has, and despite their cuts in tax rates, both JFK and LBJ <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/taxes-and-growth-rates-two-graphs.html">increased tax collections as a percentage of income</a>.   Needless to say, GW did some very, very different.</p>
<p>Which leads to these basic differences:</p>
<p>1.  Cutting tax rates has very different effects when tax rates are high than when they are low. <br />2.  My guess is that the tax rate cuts under JFK/LBJ didn&#8217;t benefit one small segment of taxpayers as disproportionately as GW&#8217;s tax rate cuts have done.<br />3.  JFK/LBJ continued to pay down the debt.  Needless to say, GW has done the opposite.<br />4.  JFK/LBJ&#8217;s social policies were designed to broaden the economy by making even the poorest members of society more of a part of it.  <br />5.  JFK/LBJ ushered in the era of the technocrats.  The eggheads descended on Washington and put a lot of time and effort into figuring out what to do.  They weren&#8217;t always right.  And they included folks who were from the other side of the aisle &#8211; C. Douglas Dillon, Secretary of the Treasury from 1961 to 1965, was a Republican.  I don&#8217;t have to mention how this differs from GW&#8217;s administration.</p>

                                <p>This post is for Bruce Webb.  Some other readers (and yes, that does include you, Coberly) may find it interesting too, but Bruce Webb, please pay attention.  </p>
<p>Anyway, you may recall not long ago I had <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/republican-party-and-national-debt.html">a post on the National Debt</a> for <a href="http://facingup.org/blog/scottbittle/2007/12/9-trillion-debt-and-counting-facing-blog-carnival">Facing Up</a>, a blog carnival on the national debt put together by folks from Brookings, the Concord Coalition, the Heritage Foundation, Public Agenda and Viewpoint Learning, together with support from the Ford Foundation, The William and Flora Hewlitt foundation, and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to name a few.  Some big boys and girls, basically.</p>
<p>Now&#8230;  they&#8217;re soliciting posts on <a href="http://www.facingup.org/node/201/perspectives">Social Security</a> for their next blog carnival.  So if you have a blog and something to say about the topic, now is the time.  And if you have something to say but no blog, let me know&#8230;  perhaps you can guest blog your entry right here.</p>
