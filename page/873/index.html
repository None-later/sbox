                                <p>Last week I made a note to link to <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2007/03/fact_check.html">this post</a> at Obsidian Wings.  I just spotted the note.  </p>
<p>Hilzoy notes the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/28/AR2007032801878.html">commentary</a> <a href="http://www.redstate.com/stories/featured_stories/all_together_now_the_largest_tax_increase_in_history">in</a> <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/q=ODUyZjNjZDExMjdkYjVmYjU5Zjc0NDZlZDZiNGZjNTQ=">some</a> <a href="http://www.qando.net/details.aspx?Entry=5723">quarters</a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following the example set by their Senate brethren last Friday, House Democrats will adopt a budget resolution containing the largest tax increase in U.S. history amid massive national inattention.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bet you didn&#8217;t know that, eh?  The Dems are already pushing through the largest tax increase in US history!  And nobody is paying attention!  </p>
<p>Anyway, Hilzoy digs a bit further into the story.  It really is <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2007/03/fact_check.html">owrth reading</a>.  </p>
<p>Long story short&#8230; Republican Congresses chose not to make their tax cuts (or, as PGL would note, their tax deferrments) permanent.  They didn&#8217;t have to put in a sunset clause &#8211; they chose to, in an attempt to make long term projections look better.  Even with that obfuscation, the situation no longer looks quite so rosy.  But&#8230;  if the new Democratic Congress doesn&#8217;t do what the Republican Congresses that preceded it failed to do, namely make the tax cut permanent, well, that&#8217;s the equivalent of the Democrats pushing the largest tax increase in history.</p>
<p>Maybe its just me&#8230; but since this whole thing was planned and executed by  a Republican Congress under a Republican President, shouldn&#8217;t we be refering to this as the Republican&#8217;s tax increase?  And my bet is that there are a lot of Republicans in Congress now, and that will be seeking re-election some time soon, that voted for this massive tax increase.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The EPA lost its <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">case</a> in the Supreme Court. The EPA is now obliged to regulate greenhouse gases in accordance with the Clean Air Act. While I applaud the reasoning of the majority, I find more interesting the reasoning of the minority: Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito.</p>
<p>The Clean Air Act notwithstanding, Roberts argued that the petitioners (Massachusetts et al) did not demonstrate a precise relationship between their injuries and the defendant’s (EPA’s) unlawful conduct. In short, that a precise causal relationship was not established between those gases that were not regulated or curbed and injuries sustained by the petitioners. Failure to do, according to Roberts, made their case “nonjusticiable.”</p>
<p>I thought about this one for a while, finding it quite an amusing line of argument. Now the EPA granted that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global warming—and that global warming is in fact harmful, indeed a crisis. Roberts et al were constrained to accept this assertion.</p>
<p>I thought surely the Roberts would see the logic: Greenhouse gases are contributing to global warming. Global warming is harmful: rising sea levels, desertification, loss of glacial run-off as a water source, weather, destruction of habitats, etc. Therefore, surely Massachusetts et al had just cause.</p>
<p>Not so fast. Roberts is a wily character—and a stickler for details. And the devil, as we all know, is in the details.</p>
<p>Petitioners must demonstrate a precise, causal relationship between those gases that the EPA failed to regulate and harm to themselves, the petitioners; otherwise, the petitioners&#8217; case is “nonjusticiable.”</p>
<p>Easy you say? Not when Roberts sets to work. Lawyers can do wonders, really. Brilliant legal minds, really. Hats off to them</p>
<p>“Precise, causal relationship” means exactly that. Did those particular gases contribute to sea-level rise? How much? Did they contribute to global warming? How and how much? Be precise, now. It makes no difference if we agree that they did contribute and that that contribution ipso facto is harmful. The precise causal chain between those trillions of unregulated molecules and the harm to the litigants must be established with geometric logic.</p>
<p>How much of a sea-rise did Massachusetts experience because of those particular molecules? How much of a temperature rise?</p>
<p>What harm? “Future harm” is not the question, only present harm counts.  That Congress in its foresight passed the Clean Air Act is irrelevant.  That the EPA violated the Clean Air Act is again irrelevant.</p>
<p>I can see the required response now.</p>
<p>“Yes, your honor. We tagged trillions of those molecules, more precisely, those emitted by Stormy’s car. They contributed precisely 10<sup>-20</sup> degrees of global warming, affecting sea level rise of 10<sup>-15</sup> centimeters and danger to glacial run-off in the northwest of precisely 5 gallons.”</p>
<p>“Not good, enough,” will be the response. Causal link still too ‘iffy.’ I see no precise tracking of even those molecules. Where did they go? What did they do? Case closed. Nonjusticiable.”</p>
<p>I am impressed. I really am. Talk about pushing the petitioners to the wall! Wow. Hats off.</p>
<p>This line of reasoning will be the logic du jour; count on it.</p>

                                <p>Ohio and Michigan are falling apart.</p>
<p>In the case of Michigan, it is literal. Pieces of bridge deck are falling onto cars on I-94. Infrastructure maintenance is that far behind.</p>
<p>To put this into perspective, the two states lost more manufacturing jobs since the start of the 2000-2001 recession than total jobs lost in Katrina (as best I can untangle the stats). The only replacement jobs have been in big box stores, warehouse operations (someone has to move the Chinese merchandise) and the usual food service and retail. All low value.</p>
<p>Since NAFTA light and medium manufacturing has been fleeing offshore, and the Big 3 and UAW have been engaged in a ju jitsu match in which both will die of strangulation.</p>
<p>A vicious cycle has begun, both states need to spend more money on education and infrastructure, neither can afford the spending. Both states need to raise taxes, both need to cut taxes.</p>
<p>The response of the Bush administration has been “let them eat cake,” or words to that effect.</p>
<p>The response of the Café Hayek types is “go eat libertarian cake, you are too stupid to flourish in a global economy.”</p>
<p>The Club for Growth recommends tax cuts, tax cuts and tax cuts (both states had weird corporate tax systems and needed reform, Ohio’s is sorta fixed, Michigan is still a mess).</p>
<p>The right-to-workers want to solve the problems by destroying unions.</p>
<p>The unions want to solve the problems by raising taxes and government spending.</p>
<p>Robert Rubin feels our pain, but his bonus makes him feel better.</p>
<p>Ohio Republicans both cut taxes and raise taxes, while using the state as a racketeering enterprise. They lost in 2006. Michigan Republicans, just see the Club for Growth above.</p>
<p>Ohio Democrats are very cautious and hope some high-tech miracle will happen. Michigan Democrats are waiting for leadership from Governor Granholm, and waiting, and waiting, and…..</p>
<p>So,&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;. is there anything anyone can do, or must this run its course? Do the feds have any responsibility to assist? Will something change after 2009? Any fresh ideas?</p>

                                <p>A while back, I mentioned on a post that in Brazil, one cannot build on the beach side of a street. Thus, except in some oddball situations, everyone has unimpeded access to the beach. </p>
<p>In Rio, they take this public access idea one step further. On Sundays, they close down the streets that run parallel to Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon beaches and shut down traffic on the side nearest the beach, making it into a giant pedestrian walkway. (Picture <a href="http://riodejaneiroaroundtheyear.blogspot.com/2007/04/copacabana-at-sunday-with-avenida.html">here</a>.) </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wondered why in the US, which is supposed to be a far more egalitarian society, we don&#8217;t have that kind of thing. Wander down to Malibu, for example, and you&#8217;ll find that public access to public beaches is virtually shut down by blocks of private homes. The homeowners get to all but privatize public property and the public pays for its upkeep, and no doubt any liability issues that should arise should one of the homeowners trip on their beach. What a deal.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_04/011052.php">Kevin Drum</a> had a post about another rat abandoning the USS George Bush. As Kevin says, &#8220;The line of former supporters who now understand that (a) Bush is incompetent and (b) Cheney is a serious loon is getting mighty long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ll leave the Cheney-is-a-serious-loon-issue for another day, and focus on Bush&#8217;s incompetence. I&#8217;m trying to think of what GW did that a Republican would not have expected in 2000? Of the big items, two come to mind.</p>
<p>1. Much of the whining is that GW spends like, well, Ronald Reagan. But is that really a surprise? GW promised from the beginning to increase spending on the military (remember the proposals for land-, sea- and space-based missile interceptors, including planes and satellites carrying lasers? What, this stuff was going to be free? So what was he going to cut? A revenue positive (at least now) item like Social Security? <br />2. Iraq. Well, gee, surprise. He associated himself with a bunch of folks from the Project for the New American Century, and their &#8220;policy of military strengths and moral clarity&#8221;, he hires Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz who back in the 1990s had urged Clinton to invade Iraq, and Iraq comes out of the blue? He brings on Rumsfeld&#8217;s boy as his Vice Presidential candidate, and Iraq is a complete surprise?  </p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what I think. Bush simply has done what he said he was going to do, and the results were predictably different than what he said they were going to be. He told us we&#8217;d have tax cuts and a growing surplus. He told us his economic policies would lead to growth on a par with that in the Clinton era. And he promised a less arrogant America. In each case he failed, but the failure was not intentional. He didn&#8217;t set out to create a huge deficit. Its just that his prescriptions for achieving them, classic Republican prescriptions, failed. And they failed because they simply cannot work. </p>
<p>So the rats that are abandoning the ship now, the rats that are claiming the problem is GW&#8217;s incompetence &#8211; they&#8217;re worse than GW is. They want to blame the failure for their policies on GW, and then turn around and try the same prescriptions again. </p>
<p>As an aside&#8230; they&#8217;ve done it before. They did it with Ronald Reagan. But with Ronald Reagan, the nation was lucky. The USSR was already collapsing, and Volcker was a competent Fed Chairman. So the disaster that Reagan created, the debt as far as the eye can see, was mitigated by a few accomplishments achieved by others.</p>
<p>Update.  None of the above is intended to imply I don&#8217;t think GW is massively incompetent.  I imagine a more competent individual with the same policies might have done a better job in Iraq, but we&#8217;d be in the same place when it comes to the economy.  So perhaps part of competence is being able to recognize policies that will inevitably lead to failure, which is a skill many of the ship-jumping rats clearly lack.</p>

                                <p>Some of you may remember the economic fractalist Gary Lammert. Occasionally, he would pop into Setser’s or Thoma’s or elsewhere and deliver his precise prediction of when economic doom would fall. (His latest and last prediction was for November 12, 2006, I think.) On his blog he accepted no comments; on the blogs of others, he never engaged. One pronouncement of doom and he was gone.</p>
<p>I was a frequent visitor to <a href="http://www.economicfractalist.com/">The Economic Fractalist</a>. I did not pretend to understand his quantum fractals, let alone totally believe his predictions. But his baroque style caught my eye: Convoluted sentences hundreds of words long, studded with eye-catching metaphors, like iridescent jewels. Whether his math was nothing more than mad scratchings, I could not tell. But he was on to something. Over and over again, he spoke of the danger of excessive credit, of the incredible imbalances that simply cannot defy gravity forever. He talked about economic cycles extending back to and before the Great Depression. Those vast circular fractals were about to close again, he would exclaim. “Expect the unexpected,” was how he often ended a thread. Now his blog is quiet. The prediction was wrong.</p>
<p>Now Gary is still alive and well, with a new, quieter blog, I think. He writes on the same themes, but confines them to narrower topics.</p>
<p>I think about his dilemma a lot these days. Can any of us predict with any kind of certainty? No century is like another; no decade is like another. History repeats, maybe. I agreed with his analysis, sans fractals and predictions. It seems to me that only the lucky get the date of Armageddon, a dubious distinction at best.</p>
<p>We live in a world of increasing uncertainty, of increasing complexity.</p>
<p>And fragility seems to be everywhere, not only in economics.</p>
<p>The Japanese love shark fins: Strip the fins and throw the dying shark back. But sharks eat ray fish, which in turn eat shellfish. And shellfish are crashing for the love of shark fin soup. Nouriel talks of subprime-lending moving like a contagion through the economy. Meanwhile, doctors worry about a drug resistant strain of TB, or report that the Bubonic plague is alive and well in Western parks, carried now by the fleas on squirrels. Then there is the warbling of the bird flu. And what about that pet food? Is it true that milk will rise 9% in price next year because of oil?</p>
<p>I saw a documentary last night where a thousand foot mile-wide chasm had been emptied of ice. All of it had melted in the space of a few years. I saw another documentary on the Klamath River: Indians patiently waiting for the coho salmon, which never came. In <i>Science</i>, a prestigious scientific journal, I read a study outlining how global warming as presently predicted would so alter the habitats of thousands of species that many species would crash by 2050. On another documentary, I watch in horror as those huge fishing factories, killing machines, with mile wide nets, scour the deeps, destroying everything willy-nilly. Over half the catch is unwanted, returned to the sea in a bloody cascade, where thousands of gulls hovered and screamed.. The documentary then turned to fish markets, full of fish. But for how long? Is there a limit here? .</p>
<p>Glaciers in the Himalayas are melting, I am told. They are the headwaters for major Indian and Chinese rivers. By 2030, these glaciers will be one-fifth their present size. Well, I already knew the world had problems with potable water. Australia is experiencing its worse drought in recorded history. Already, penguins are in trouble, the emperor especially. They need the ice. Wonder if Australia can snag a few mammoth ice bergs to supplement the water from their desalinization plants?</p>
<p>A friend of mine calls to tell me it’s all solar cycles. “The sun is getting larger, “ he says. I do some research. Yes, maybe there is something to that, but the only expert I can find claims that solar irradiance, at best, will add less than .076 degrees, merely reinforcing the 2-3 degrees we can expect. “Besides, “ he adds, “the weather is fine here.” I did not tell him that mid-latitude countries are supposed to experience the least harmful effects. “And what happened to all those hurricanes we were supposed to have last year,” he continues. I refrain from telling him that global warming does not guarantee many and massive Gulf hurricanes every year.</p>
<p>Ah, maybe he is right. I go outside. Seems nice to me, too. We did have a mild winter where I am. Not much snow. All that fragility, yet the world keeps on truckin’. It does seem to defy gravity.</p>
<p>Maybe we know too much…or maybe I read too much. Maybe I should get a life, huh? Or, maybe, like Gary, hoe a smaller patch.</p>

<p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YWRmOGQ0MDAwYjk3MmUzMDcwZWYxOWU3MGM4NWI0NDg=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> says he’s getting older, which is the only thing he got right here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Also noteworthy is Alan Reynolds’ recent piece that argues tax revenues as a share of the economy actually increased during the JFK, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush tax rate reduction periods. Revenues also rose following Bill Clinton’s second term tax cut package that included a reduction in the capital gains tax rate &#8230; Tax receipts have absolutely boomed in the aftermath of President Bush’s 2003 tax rate reduction package. That’s a fact. As a consequence, the budget deficit has fallen substantially &#8230; The older I get, the more militant I become on this subject. Lower tax rates do expand the economic pie. Lower tax rates do boost revenues. Art Laffer had it right, and he’s got twenty-five years of pro-growth evidence to back him up. The tax cutters were right. They won.</p></blockquote>
<p>Militant?  If Kudlow wants to declare victory in his war against reality, I’ll concede his free lunch camp has won the War of Stupidity.  We have graphed Federal revenues excluding payroll contributions as a share of GDP.  Our series captures both personal income taxes and taxes on profits.  The revenue to GDP ratio rose from 10.4% in 1992 to 13.4% in 2000.  Kudlow is so desperate to say Art Laffer was right that he has portrayed the Clinton era as a period of tax cuts.  I guess all those Republicans who complained about Clinton’s tax increase in 1993 were just not as smart as Lawrence Kudlow.</p>
<p>Now it is true that the revenue to GDP ratio rose from 9.8% in 2003 to 11.8% in 2006.  Oh golly gee – we finally recovered from the recession!  This recovery would have happened whether we cut tax rates in 2003 or not.  And maybe Mr. Kudlow might notice that the 11.8% in 2006 is lower than the 13.4% in 2000. </p>
<p>You might ask why I excluded payroll contributions.  It is because Kudlow wants to reach back to the 1960’s and the 1980’s in his attempts to claim that tax rate cuts led to supply-side miracles.  Anyone who understands tax policy, however, understands that we saw increases in payroll tax rates.  Real payroll taxes did rise during Reagan’s Administration precisely because we raised tax rates.  The ratio of Federal revenues excluding payroll contributions to GDP actually fell from 1963 to 1967 and during the Reagan era.  On the latter, we should not be surprised as the fiscal irresponsibility during the 1980’s led to lower national savings and less long-term growth.</p>
<p>But let me vent about this notion that John Kennedy signed a pro-growth tax cut.  First of all, the 1964 tax cut was signed by President Lyndon Johnson.  Secondly, he came to regret this fiscal stimulus after the economy got back to full employment and we realized we were entering a period of excess aggregate demand.  The first response of the Federal Reserve in 1966 was to raise interest rates, which led to the 1966 Credit Crunch.  Since Mr. Kudlow likely has not a clue what the Credit Crunch was, let me help him out.  The lower national savings combined with tight monetary policy to offset this fiscal stimulus leads to higher interest rates, which leads to less investment demand.  Lower investment demand equates to slower long-term growth.  Most people get this simple point.  But Mr. Kudlow is getting old and apparently militant and senile.</p>

<blockquote><p>The United States and South Korea successfully concluded a free trade agreement after almost 10 months of contentious negotiations, a U.S. official said Monday. The deal, which requires legislative approval in both countries, is the biggest for the United States since the North American Free Trade Agreement signed in 1992 and ratified in 1993. It is the biggest ever for South Korea &#8230; Differences over trade in automobiles, agriculture, textiles and other issues, including the status of South Korean goods manufactured at a small enclave in North Korea, had thrown up obstacles &#8230; Shortly after midnight Monday, the White House released a letter from Bush to congressional leaders, dated April 1, stating his intention to enter into a free trade agreement with South Korea.  He said the deal &#8220;will generate export opportunities for U.S. farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and service suppliers, promote economic growth and the creation of better paying jobs in the United States.&#8221; But South Korean labor and farm groups have denounced the deal, saying an influx of U.S. imports will harm livelihoods. A protester set himself on fire Sunday shouting &#8220;Stop the Korea-U.S. FTA&#8221; outside the hotel where negotiators were meeting. He was being treated for third-degree burns, police said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Former Angrybear and fellow free trade advocate <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/us-korea-free-trade-agreement.html">Kash</a> notes this bill will have both bipartisan support and bipartisan opposition: </p>
<blockquote><p>There will probably be a fair amount of resistance in Washington (from some Republicans as well as Democrats, but not nearly as much as there would be if the deal was with a low-wage country such as Mexico. After all, according to the BLS average hourly labor costs in manufacturing in Korea were fully 57% of US labor costs in 2005, which is about the same as in Israel and New Zealand. By comparison, Mexico&#8217;s labor costs are about 11 percent of the US&#8217;s, Brazil comes in at 17 percent, Hungary and the Czech Republic are at 26 percent, and Portugal is at 31 percent of US labor costs. As usual, however, any controversy over this agreement will probably be blown considerably out of proportion. On the one hand, passage of the agreement would probably have no real measurable impact on the US labor market, since tariff rates are already low, wage differentials are relatively small, and Korea is so small (relative to the US economy). But on the other hand, passage of the agreement would probably also have almost no measurable benefit for consumers in the US, for exactly the same reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me turn Ricardian for a moment and note that wage differentials are not exactly the same thing as differences in unit labor costs. But I suspect Kash is right about the premise that there will be little measurable impact on the U.S. macroeconomy.  I’d rather look at the specifics in terms of what we <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/product/enduse/exports/c5800.html">export</a> to Korea and <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/product/enduse/imports/c5800.html">import</a> from Korea.  In 2006, we exported almost $32.5 billion of goods.  In terms of 5-digit end-user codes, the big ticket areas (defined as more than $1 billion in exports) were chemicals-organic, industrial machines-other, semiconductors, civilian aircraft, and military aircraft-complete In 2006, we imported almost $46 billion of goods.  In terms of 5-digit end-user codes, the big ticket areas (defined as more than $1 billion in imports) were other petroleum products, iron and steel mill products-semifinished, computer accessories&#038;peripherals&#038;parts, passenger cars, other automotive parts&#038;accessories, household&#038;kitchen appliances, clocks&#038;portable typewriters&#038;other household goods, and television receivers.  While I look forward to increased competition in the HDTV market so I can finally justify a new big screen TV, something tells me that Detroit does not look forward to increased competition in the automobile sector while the U.S. steel sector will also be looking at this deal very carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Kash comments and provides us with <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/ForeignLabor/prodsuppt10.txt">this handy </a> time series of unit labor costs for certain nations including the U.S. and Korea. It would seem unit labor costs have been rising in Korea but declining in the U.S. for the past few years.  As Kash states, the two economies had very similar unit labor costs in 2005.  Query – is this because real wages have risen for Korean workers but not for American workers?</p>
<p><strong>Errata</strong>: AB reader Spencer cautions Kash (and me too) that BLS is reporting index numbers not absolute comparison.  So when Kash said Korea and the US had the same unit labor cost in 2005, what he meant to say was that the average change in unit labor cost for the 1992 to 2005 period was the same in the two nations.</p>

                                <p>I probably shouldn&#8217;t respond on the fly to anything by a guy as Tyler Cowen, and I&#8217;m heading out the door in literally minutes, but <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/04/leftwingers_sho.html">here</a> he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Left-wingers should be the real supply-siders</strong></p>
<p>This post is pure provocation, take it as you will.</p>
<p>The left often stresses how wealthy people have superior opportunities in life. They can save more, avoid debt, buy better educations, they have a better chance to start a company, and so on. Furthermore this is seen as unfair. Right?</p>
<p>To put the point in simple quantitative terms, equity yields an average of about seven percent, while holding debt claims yields a bit over one percent. Most poor people don&#8217;t hold much equity, or for that matter they tend to take out debt rather than hold it. Smart rich people stock their portfolios with equity quite heavily. So on average rich people get richer. That is even more unfair. Right?</p>
<p>OK, to oversimplifiy the numbers just a bit, rich people earn &#8212; at least &#8212; six to seven times more on their money than do poor people. Many of the poor earn negative rates of return.</p>
<p>The contemporary left often seeks to remedy this unfairness, but in the meantime it is true true true. Right?</p>
<p>So for each extra dollar we leave with rich people, the economy earns six or seven times more in net terms &#8212; at least &#8212; than if that dollar had been given to the poor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rich people&#8217;s economy&#8221; doubles in size about every ten years or so. &#8220;The poor people&#8217;s economy&#8221; doubles in size about every sixty years or so, at best. After sixty years have passed, &#8220;the rich people&#8217;s economy&#8221; has done at least six times better, relative to its original starting point. </p>
<p>Now trickle-down effects from rich people are possibly quite slight. If a rich person creates a dollar&#8217;s worth of investment, the consumer surplus and wage-boosting effects from those investments won&#8217;t be more than 25 cents on the dollar, right? That means poor people get&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I do have a few questions&#8230;.</p>
<p>1. If there is a single best investor in the US (perhaps its Warren Buffett?), would we all be better off if he/she gets everyone&#8217;s income to invest? In other words, what if the government simply took everyone else&#8217;s income and gave it to that person &#8211; no doubt a great investor would be able to double the money in far less than ten years. Or does this sort of Pareto efficiency argument only apply when we&#8217;re talking about large numbers of people?</p>
<p>2. Maybe the poor are being rational only earning their piddly one sixth returns of the wealthy. Consider&#8230; if at the end of the year you have some spare change lying around to put away, and that spare change is $100,000 (so we&#8217;re not talking Warren Buffet, we&#8217;re talking something that is easy for the top percent of income earners), you have many options to invest. And odds are very high, whatever choice that person takes, the brokerage fees and other costs associated with the investment are probably minimal relative to the return. Now, consider someone in the bottom 20% of income &#8211; a much larger share of the population. At the end of the year, what do they have to invest? And how many investment vehicles are available to them with that sum? And what share of any potential returns will be eaten up by fees? And after all this, is this really a better investment than trying to maintain that minimum balance in the bank that keeps one from having to pay penalties for bouncing checks. Or, for those in a bit better financial shape than that, keeping enough in the bank to achieve that minimum balance that keeps the bank from charging a check fee?</p>
<p>3. If lower taxes lead to faster growth&#8230;. why did the economy grow faster in the 1960s than since that time? why did it grow faster under Clinton than under GW? Why did it grow faster once you account for debt under Clinton than Reagan? Considering the historical tax decisions made by the various states, would we all be better off if the entire country behaved like Taxachussetts, New York, and California, or if the entire country behaved like Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee? Which states have driven the economic prosperity of the country for the last hundred years or so?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before, and others have as well&#8230; the problem with economics is that most economists simply are unable to grasp the issues that affect a very, very large segment of the US economy.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In previous posts, I indicated that going back to 1959, on average we observe patterns in the Fed Funds rate, real M1 per capita, real M2 per capita, and even the 10 year bond rate that we would only expect to see if we were paranoid and thought the Fed was trying to influence elections.  Furthermore, this pattern of funny behavior <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-independence-and-alan-greenspan.html">became funnier during the Greenspan era</a>.</p>
<p>Several readers have indicated that perhaps this behavior is tied to Fed policy, and that the Fed is simply following the Taylor rule.  My impression, since grad school, is that the Taylor rule is one of those irrelevancies that people talk about as if its important but which doesn’t affect policy at all.  But, I could be wrong, and we aim to please at Angry Bear, so here goes…</p>
<p>The Taylor rule, supposedly, is a rule that the Fed uses (or should use or maybe perhaps kinda sorta uses, or whatever) to determine what the Fed Funds rate “should be.”  </p>
<p>The basic rule <a href="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:JdtSlS9HxogJ:www.columbia.edu/~mw2230/taylor.pdf+taylor+rule&#038;hl=en&#038;ct=clnk&#038;cd=5&#038;gl=us">is</a>:</p>
<p>Taylor Rule Fed Funds rate  = 0.04 + 1.5(inflation -0.02) <br />                                              + .5(ln(GDP) &#8211; ln(potential GDP))</p>
<p>Why inflation less 0.02?  Well, supposedly the Fed should (or does or kinda does) target a 2% inflation rate.  Now, I understand the GDP deflator is generally used to correct for inflation, but I figure that results should be the same using inflation computed using CPI, and since I already had CPI handy, that’s the approach I took.  I can’t see how it would make a systematic difference.</p>
<p><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/GDPPOT/downloaddata?&#038;cid=106">Real potential GDP</a> is available from the St. Louis fed.  The data is available for January, April, July and October.  This is a bit off from the real GDP figures, which are available March, June, September and December.  I assumed that it would be OK to subtract one series from the other – while errors might exist, I assumed there wouldn’t be systematically different from one period to the next.  </p>
<p>OK.  Now, before going on, what might we expect to see?  In my case – recall what I’ve stated in several posts.  My belief is that during the Greenspan years, in 1988, the Fed did nothing to influence the election.  However, I think that in 1992, 1996, and 2000, the Fed did try to influence elections, but by moving real M1 per capita.  (Since the quarterly correlation between the fed funds rate and the percentage change in real M1 per capita is about negative .28 going back to 1959, moving real M1 per capita will not necessarily require a move in the fed funds rate.)  Finally, I stated several times that I think the Fed tried to influence the 2004 election by dropping the fed funds rate.</p>
<p>Now, if I’m right, that means in 2004, we should see the Fed Funds rate drop relative to the Taylor Rule rate.  This despite the fact that the Fed Funds rate was already relatively low as a result of the massive rate cuts in the early years of the GW administration.  In fact, because the Fed probably believes it takes a few months for the Fed Funds rate to have an effect on the economy, I would expect the biggest difference between the Fed Funds rate and the Taylor rate to occur a few months (between 3 and 9, perhaps?) before the November election.  In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if that proved to be the biggest spread between the two series in the entire Greenspan era, again, despite the big drops after 2001.</p>
<p>Someone more rational, who knows Greenspan wouldn’t do such a thing, would say something different.  Given the reductions in the Fed Funds rate in 2001 – 2003, and the fact that the economy was picking up by 2004 (remember &#8211; the administration still hasn&#8217;t stoped bragging about the economy&#8217;s behavior since the 2003 round of tax cuts), such a person would assume the FF would be more than the Taylor rule rate, or at the very least, the gap between the real fed funds rate and the Taylor rule rate would be narrowing by 2004.  </p>
<p>So what do we see?  </p>
<p>The table below shows the 4th quarter Fed Funds rate less Taylor rule rate for each of the Greenspan years.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RhDu_F_mJnI/AAAAAAAAAKo/hZaCoBgUL0k/s1600-h/Fed+Funds+less+Taylor+Rule.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RhDu_F_mJnI/AAAAAAAAAKo/hZaCoBgUL0k/s320/Fed+Funds+less+Taylor+Rule.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Hmmm… turns out that the spread did indeed widen in November 2004 relative to other Novembers.  One crazy-assed cynical prediction borne out.  What about in the year leading up to 2004 elections?  Well, it turns out that in Q2 of 2004, fed funds less the Taylor rule was -.043.  In absolute terms, this was the biggest spread between the two series in Greenspan’s entire tenure as Fed Chair.  So another crazy-assed cynical prediction borne out.  Granted, this is only one election… so no doubt its just a coincidence, but this is about the 14th or 15th post I’ve written on the Fed’s behavior around election time, and in each post, I’ve shown a coincidence or three.  So chalk this one up as another random coincidence.</p>
