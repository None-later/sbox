                                <p>UPDATE:  Brad DeLong notes that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/10/good-luck-neel.html">there is no requirement, under the bailout bill, for halfway measures and delays</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Every other country that is in this business is nationalizing the banks and injecting capital into them. Only the United States is operating on the asset side along. It&#8217;s unlikely to work, and Neel is now responsible.</p>
<p>Time to shift the focus of the TARP: it shouldn&#8217;t be buying up assets, it should be injecting capital and taking equity instead&#8211;which it can do, the way that Dodd and Frank have written it. But it probably won&#8217;t do until Paulson is replaced.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of this post can now be read as an explanation of why that last sentence is true.</p>
<p>The book <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/cnnm/081006/100608_treasury_hiring_guidelines.html">is being written</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Appoint a crony you brought with you to Treasury to run the program. Refer to him as &#8220;a former executive&#8221; in the press release because it sounds More Authoritative*:<br />
<blockquote>[Neel] Kashkari, a former executive at Goldman Sachs, is the assistant Treasury secretary for International Economics and Development. He joined Treasury in July 2006 and worked on several of Treasury&#8217;s initiatives in response to the housing crisis &#8211; including the formation of the mortgage industry alliance Hope Now.</p></blockquote>
<p></li>
<li>Admit that you&#8217;re going to be picking your friends for all the other jobs as well, while trying to make it sound as if it were a virtue forced upon you, not something for which you have been preparing** for months:<br />
<blockquote>The Treasury on Monday also released its guidelines for how it would hire firms to manage asset purchases.</p>
<p>It cited the need to begin the program urgently. Asset managers and other private-sector agents involved in running it may be hired &#8220;through other than full and open competition,&#8221; the Treasury said in a statement.</p>
<p>The department will post help wanted notices on its Web site and applicants will be reviewed in a two-stage process after they&#8217;ve expressed interest.</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Stage 1: Do I owe him a favor, or will he owe me one?  If not, no.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Will he find me a job on 21 January 2009? If not, no.</p>
<p>Further chapters as the details expand.</p>
<p>*He was a VP at Goldman, which is technically &#8220;executive-level,&#8221; but not exactly close to C-level.</p>
<p>**I was going to say &#8220;should have been preparing,&#8221; since the recession is now four quarters old, until I realised that Paulson has been preparing—for the coming kleptocracy.</p>

<blockquote>But Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Sen. McCain&#8217;s senior policy adviser, said Sunday that the campaign has always planned to fund the tax credits, in part, with savings from Medicare and Medicaid. Those government health-care programs serve seniors, poor families and the disabled. Medicare spending for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 is estimated at $457.5 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>At least he made it official.</p>

<p>Looks like I should have put the post to which the post below links here.  Thanks for clicking the link.  I will try to add up by adding a point here.</p>
<p>Sebastian Mallaby argues that deregulation did not cause the crisis, because hedge funds are regulated even less than investment banks.  Based on something I read somewhere on the web, I noted that it is hard for hedge funds to get in trouble during a quarter as their investors can&#8217;t pull out money (it can be done LTCM managed but it is hard).</p>
<p>Now I will make another argument.  The anti Sebastian (let&#8217;s call him <a href="http://www.saintsebastian.us/pictures/martyrdom-of-saint-sebastian.jpg">archer</a>) argues that regulations were fine on January 20 1993 and that the changes from then till now made the crisis possible (or at least worse than it would otherwise be).  The changes would be de-regulation and a failure to create new regulations to deal with new financial instruments.  Roughly the Commodities Futures modernization act of 2000 and the 2004 decision to allow investment banks to increase leverage.</p>
<p>Now this has nothing to do with hedge funds.  They existed and were regulated in 1993 and they exist under roughly ?) the same regulations now.  </p>
<p>The point is that regulations do not fall out of the sky.  They are created because of a perceived need for regulation.  A type of firm might be lightly regulated because of neglect.  If so, relatively good performance by that type of firm is a sign that regulation is bad.  Rather more likely a type of firm might be lightly regulated because legislators and regulators think that it is not dangerous.  Mom and pop book stores have played a minor role in the crisis.  They are lightly regulated.  Does this prove Mallaby&#8217;s point ?  I think the answer is obviously no.  </p>
<p>So, if hedge funds played a minor role in the crisis, would that prove Mallaby&#8217;s point ?  I would say it is just as obviously no.  </p>
<p>Banks are highly regulated, because, by their nature, they are at risk of bank runs.  They borrow short term and invest long term.  Their creditors make small investments and, rationally, do not invest large amounts of money in looking out for their investment.  </p>
<p>Hedge funds borrow medium term and in huge chunks of at least $100 million.  Therefore the logic of banking regulation implies (and has implied since the first hedge fund was founded) that there is little need to regulate hedge funds.  </p>
<p>The change in regulation concerns banks and insurance companies.  If the crisis were confined to sectors where regulation changed, that would tend to be evidence that the change in regulation contributed to the problem.</p>
<p>If the crisis also affected firms which no one had ever argued should be regulated (as we will probably learn it did) that would tend to be evidence against the hypothesis of the advocates of keeping regulation the way it was in 1992.  </p>
<p>The idea that support for the logic of the old regulatory strategy is proof that it was no good is so silly that only a top pundit could think of it.</p>

<p>Two Frauds, and Preventing Another</p>
<p>Actually, a lot of things are obvious to people with the information, but are best ignored.  Back in the 1950s and 1960s and 1970s, a bunch of really smart guys from the big American banks were making huge loans to dictatorships in South America.  They knew damn well that the loans could never be paid back.  See, they knew that every time they loaned $100 million to a country run by General So and So, within 2 months a woman who happened to be General So and So&#8217;s wife would show up at their local branch in Miami, and her bodyguard would be carrying $10 million in cash to be deposited in their bank accounts.  And a few days before that, his mistress would show up with one suitcase. And a month after that, the Vice President would show up with a suitcase.  So they knew damn well the money was being stolen, and thus could never be paid back (though the South American countries would eventually try, and hyperinflation would be the result). </p>
<p>But&#8230;  so what?  Because, the defaults came ten and twenty years later, and the guys who made the loans had long been promoted by then.  And two decades worth of bonuses and promotions never had to be paid back. (And the fraudsters on the other side, the generals, were also long gone by then.) </p>
<p>The more interesting folks are the ones who came around later, or were still in the business of getting bonuses from making loans ten and twenty years after the game started.  Many of them simply assumed that since it worked in the past, it would continue to work in the future.  Put another way &#8211; most scam artists are as duped as the folks being scammed, but they do it to themselves, after a eventually believing the story line they peddle after they repeat it long enough.  The smart ones and the lucky ones get out long before.  What complicates the current mess, relative to the scam of loaning money to dictators, is that the time frame was compressed &#8211; instead of decades, we&#8217;re talking years. </p>
<p>What makes stories like this tragic, though, is not that a bunch of fraudsters defrauded themselves and a bunch of marks.  What makes this tragic is that the bill ends up getting paid by the third parties who didn&#8217;t participate in the fraud.  The reason is simple &#8211; the really guilty, the ones who cook up these schemes, never pay a price.  Ever.  You want to prevent stuff like this from happening in the future, its simple &#8211; prosecute the former heads of every investment bank and every other organization that participated in this sort of nonsense.  And yes, I do include our current Treasury Secretary. Charge them with &#8220;financial terrorism.&#8221;  No need for trials&#8230;  for the duration of the economic crisis and for however long the ripples may be moving through the economy.   Ask them repeatedly to see if they give up names of other financial terrorists. </p>
<p>You can&#8217;t stop smart fraudsters from dreaming up schemes, especially the ones that are smart enough to get out on time.  But bailing the ones who were too slow and too stupid to get out on time?  That just guarantees that the next fraudulent scheme will have a bunch of thugs joining in and thus grow to massive proportions.  Capitalism doesn&#8217;t work, it isn&#8217;t even capitalism, if people don&#8217;t pay a price for failure. <br /> _________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<blockquote><p>Washington — The U.S. House of Representatives today passed the $700-billion financial-system bailout bill that was approved on Wednesday by the Senate. The plan would let the federal government ease credit markets by purchasing bank assets, involving primarily mortgages but also other types of assets, including student loans.</p>
<p>Congress acted five months after it approved an earlier bailout bill that helped student-loan companies by allowing the Education Department to purchase assets derived from loans that the banks had issued as part of the government-subsidized student-loan program.</p>
<p>The $700-billion bailout package approved today, while aimed mainly at helping banks that hold many failed mortgages, also will let the government purchase a range of assets related to student loans.</p>
<p>The new legislation, which passed on a vote of 263 to 171, raises the possibility that student-loan providers will be allowed to go beyond the terms established by May’s bailout and sell assets to the government that are based on older federal loans, as well as assets involving the private student loans that banks issue outside the government system of federal subsidies.</p>
<p>That authority was opposed last week by a coalition of 13 groups, including the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. The groups said that if private student loans were made eligible for government purchase in the mortgage-bailout plan, then Congress should provide student-loan borrowers with the same protections given to homeowners, including the right to discharge the debt through bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The bailout bill was supported, however, by President Bush and the American Council on Education, which wrote on Wednesday to Congress, arguing that the nation’s credit crisis was beginning to have adverse effects on many colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush and like-minded lawmakers repeatedly cited the possible effects on colleges as one of the justifications for passing the bailout bill. As a result of today’s vote, Mr. Bush said afterward, “More families will be able to get loans for cars and homes and college education.” —Paul Basken</p>

<p>The reason that the Department of Education was only supposed to purchase this year’s student loans was so that the banks would not bundle only older delinquent loans for sale. The rationale for the Department buying them back at all was to free up money to lend, not to eliminate all lender risk.</p></blockquote>

<p>Don’t ask, don’t tell: whether anything in DoD is worth the expense of scarce national resources.</p>
<p>Read GAO Testimony: <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d081159t.pdf"> Fundamental Changes Are Needed to Improve Weapon Program Outcomes</a></p>
<p>In 2000 the defense acquisition portfolio was:  75 programs with planned commitments of $790B, increases from planned R&#038;D of 27% and average schedule delay of 16 months.</p>
<p>In 2005 the defense acquisition portfolio was:  91 programs with planned commitments of $1500B, increases from planned R&#038;D of 33% and average schedule delay of 17 months.</p>
<p>In 2007 the defense acquisition portfolio was:  95 programs with planned commitments of $1600B and increases from planned R&#038;D of 40% and average schedule delay of 21months.</p>
<p>The testimony notes that decisions are not based on knowledge, a recurring cultural theme, and that requirements are neither known nor translated into engineering specifications which can be tested to meet the needs.  Generally, requirements are based on the last war and the marketing plans of people concerned about the “health of the industry”.</p>
<p>The GAO data shows that as the portfolio grows over runs and schedule delays increase.  One externality should be considered inbreeding in the acquisition work force.  Since 2000 penalties (reduced annuities) for retired military officers who take civil service jobs have been eliminated and the revolving door for military retirees has diluted the competence of career civil servant ranks in the higher grades.   Hiring O-6 captains and colonels is insidious, and contributes to the diminishing effectiveness of the defense acquisition process.</p>
<p>This confirms something I have seen.  My conclusion is the defense acquisition work force is broken in large part due to the revolving door.  No one will risk their “career” to tell the boss the “emperor has no clothes”.<br />________________________________<br />by reader ilsm</p>

                                <p>Stormy noted that Wells Fargo&#8217;s bill is based in part on &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/wachovia-citigroup-wells-fargo.html">exploiting a presumed tax loophole</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I forgot to ask the question one should always ask when confronted with a Chess Ending problem, &#8220;What was the move before?&#8221;</p>
<p>In this case, we know (from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/pulled-from-comments-other-half-of.html">A C Shareholder&#8217;s comment</a>) that Wells had been discussions to purchase &#8220;WalkAllOverYa&#8221; last weekend.  But they didn&#8217;t commit then, while, suddenly, Friday, they did, in what the Wall Street Journal editorial page <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122307417911703781.html">would like us to believe is an example of free-market capitalism coming to the rescue</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A better canary in the cyclone is Thursday night&#8217;s news that Wells Fargo has agreed to buy Wachovia for $15.4 billion and without any government involvement. Only Sunday night, Wells Fargo had backed out of a similar deal for a higher price.</p></blockquote>
<p>Without any government involvement? Marcy Gordon of BusinessWeek (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/10/will-a-tax-cut.html">Mark Thoma</a>) <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D93JA4K83.htm">sets the record straight</a>:<br />
<blockquote>On Tuesday, the Internal Revenue Service issued guidance boosting banks&#8217; ability to offset the losses from loans and other bad debts held by other banks they acquire. The guidance allows banks to take larger tax write-offs against future profits&#8230;.</p>
<p>Before the IRS ruling this week, there were limits on the amount of certain losses that an acquiring bank could write off against post-combination profits. Now those limits have been suspended, said Jeff Harte, an analyst at Sandler O&#8217;Neill.</p>
<p>With banks suffering billions in losses from soured mortgage-related assets, the IRS move &#8220;potentially increases buyers&#8217; ability to realize tax benefits from bank acquisitions,&#8221; Harte wrote in a note issued Friday. The change &#8220;could spur significant bank industry consolidation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We suspect that the new IRS guidance allowed Wells Fargo to place a higher bid for Wachovia today than it might have been willing to a few days ago,&#8221; Harte said.</p></blockquote>
<p>And who was responsible for the IRS announcement?  Mark Sunshine, <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/will-paulsons-two-plans-unplug-the-liquidity-trap/">guest-blogging at the NYT Economix blog</a>, suggests it was Secretary of the Treasury Paulson:<br />
<blockquote>But Mr. Paulson’s fiscal-stimulus work didn’t end with the bailout bill.</p>
<p>With hardly anyone noticing, on Wednesday he pushed through very technical and obscure changes to tax regulations that provide a &#8220;tax subsidy&#8221; for acquirers of troubled banks. Just as automakers stimulate car sales through rebate checks, the Treasury is providing a form of tax rebate to acquirers of troubled banks. Everyone can thank Hank Paulson and his stealth tax-driven fiscal stimulus for the astonishing news that Wachovia was being acquired by Wells Fargo and not Citigroup. It was Mr. Paulson’s tax subsidy to Wells Fargo that provided the fiscal grease to make this deal happen. Pundits who point to the deal and proclaim that the &#8220;free markets work without government help&#8221; don’t understand the motivating effect of several billion dollars of tax benefits to Wells Fargo. </p></blockquote>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t have said that last better myself.</p>

                                <p>A detail of tax law makes all the difference in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/wachovia-citigroup-wells-fargo.html">Stormy&#8217;s post below</a>.  Buy the whole thing, get the tax break.  Buy part of it, you don&#8217;t.*</p>
<p>The other half of the answer is that &#8220;timing is everything.&#8221;  And playing Chicken with the FDIC often has Unintended Consequences.**  So let&#8217;s turn the continuous-not-discrete timeline details over to reader A C Shareholder <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/2658912203484449642/#723255">in comments to Stormy</a> (minor edits for style):<br />
<blockquote>While obviously I am biased because Wachovia stole 20% of my equity value on Friday, I do think it&#8217;s always fun to watch the Monday morning quarterbacks talk about Wells Fargo as if they only needed a little more time.</p>
<p>When you are dealing with a bank run, you do not have a &#8220;couple of days.&#8221; The &#8220;couple of days&#8221; was the FDIC trying to get Wachovia and Wells Fargo together starting on the Thursday before last weekend and then Wells bailing around Saturday night, Sunday morning. Wells Fargo played chicken with the FDIC by walking away. Do not believe for a minute that walking away from the table wasn&#8217;t a a calculated move designed to put Wachovia in receivership a la WaMu. The only problem was Wells didn&#8217;t foresee Citi putting a deal together that quickly.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s try to construct what would have happened last weekend if Citi doesn&#8217;t step in. Wells leaves Wachovia at the altar Sunday night. Not a great sign of confidence for Wachovia. Market and business opens on Monday. Everyone had been anticipating a deal over the weekend—without one, CFOs and Treasurers get antsy. Noon, the House votes down the bailout package. Immediately, wire and ACH transactions begin hammering Wachovia. Suppose they get through the day, overnight banks refuse to lend to Wachovia. Wachovia&#8217;s funding dries up (look at LIBOR and the TED spread). Tuesday, money continues to pour out of Wachovia. After a brief pop, the market is hearing more about Wachovia precarious position and starts trending lower. Without funding sources, Wachovia is at the Fed window for all monies. Tuesday overnight, still Wachovia cannot borrow from its peers—deposit base is down 15 &#8211; 20 billion. Wednesday, FDIC seeing that the market has lost confidence in Wachovia steps in and puts Wachovia into receivership.</p>
<p>As for the FDIC&#8217;s ability to get anymore deals done, it doesn&#8217;t absolutely stop them. However, now all deals will be receivership deals like WaMu. Wells, Chase, and BofA are all just under or over the 10% deposit base limit so none of them have the ability to merge anymore. The only bank with the ability to merge balance sheets is Citi. As for the others (US Bancorp, PNC, and BB&#038;T), they may be able to do something but they have much smaller asset base in which to spread out losses. If you are VikrAm Pandit, are you going to do another OPEN transaction again with the FDIC or are you going to have the FDIC put &#8217;em in a body baG and wipe out all debt and equity holders? Every regional bank shareholder that goes to receivership from here on out can thank Wells and Wachovia when there debt and equity gets wiped out.</p>
<p>So in return for my use of capital and stock last week that came in at the 11th hour and saved Wachovia and then floated them for an entire week of the worst funding environment in decades perhaps ever &#8211; I get a 20% loss as the CEO of Wachovia was smiling and grinning as late as Thursday. This knife in my back belongs to Wachovia&#8217;s CEO Steele.</p></blockquote>
<p>*This is nothing Citigroup wouldn&#8217;t have known.  The next step in the process is to realize that C valued the non-banking operations of &#8220;WalkAllOverYa&#8221; at less than the net value of the tax break. The implications of that are left to the reader. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: This is not necessarily so—see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/cynics-version-of-wells-fargo-fdic.html">my follow-up post</a>—they valued the net value of the non-banking operations as less than the <em>Expected</em> tax break&#8217;s value, which was even lower than the value Wells is using.</p>
<p>**In this case, we have to assume the consequences really were Unintended, since assuming that Citigroup would buy the banking operations if Wells walked away would—<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/06/business/06bank.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;oref=slogin&#038;adxnnlx=1223233531-aAjjfhul2cUz94p8RVsBcg&#038;pagewanted=print">as has become the case</a>—make the acquisition more difficult for Wells. Which is as it should be.</p>
