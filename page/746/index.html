                                <p>Update&#8230;.</p>
<p>Sheesh.  I wake up this morning and my first thought is&#8230; what the heck was I thinking last night?  I have to put a bit more thought into these things that I write at the end of the day.  </p>
<p>We all make stupid mistakes and this qualifies as one of mine.  I think its been a while since I put up something this dumb.  </p>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing a bit of work on taxes and income right now, and I found something really uncool.  First, <a rhef="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f01ar.html">this table</a> shows us the income limits for families for each income quintile and the top 5% of income earners.  Second, <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/70xx/doc7000/Spreadsheets.xls">Table 1A of this CBO spreadsheet</a> gives us the total effective federal tax burden of faced by folks in the various income quintiles, and the top 10%, 5%, and 1% of income earners.  (Data for 2003 and 2004 come from <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/77xx/doc7718/EffectiveTaxRates.pdf">this update</a>.)</p>
<p>With this, we can measure the progressivity (or lack of it) of the tax system.  See, if the system is progressive, then the difference between the tax burden imposed on people who earn a lot and the tax burden on people who earn very little will be bigger than the difference in income earned by both groups.  A person who makes 10 times what another person makes will pay more than 10 times as much in taxes.  If the tax system is regressive, then the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Most of you can already see where this is going.  If you can&#8217;t, you&#8217;re not enough of a cynic, or in denial and trying to think up an excuse.  But keep reading, because there is at least one real surprise in this post.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a graph showing two curves.  The first curve is the ratio of low income individuals (which I&#8217;m defining as those at the bottom quintile) to high income individuals (the top 5% of income earners).  The second curve is the ratio of the tax burden imposed on the low income earners to the tax burden imposed on the high income earners.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1YAwL04KjI/AAAAAAAAA5Q/7r1FFNRb9rU/s1600-h/Income+and+Taxes+-+Ratios.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1YAwL04KjI/AAAAAAAAA5Q/7r1FFNRb9rU/s320/Income+and+Taxes+-+Ratios.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>What we see is this:</p>
<p>1.  The ratio of incomes is lower than the ratio of tax burdens.  As an example&#8230; in the year 2000, low income folks made 14.99% of the income of high income folks.  (Those at the bottom made $24,000, those at the top made over $160,000)  But the tax burden on low income folks was 20.65% of the tax burden on high income folks.  (Those at the bottom had a 6.4% tax burden, and those at the top had a 31% tax burden.) Put another way&#8230;  an increase in income leads to a less than proportional increase in the tax burden.<br />2.  On the plus side, the system is heading in the direction of being progressive &#8211; and has continued to head in that direction even under GW!   But that&#8217;s a recent phenomenon.  Under Reagan, the system became a lot more regressive, especially through 1986. <br />3.  What happened from 1996 to 2000?  I suspect  the booming stock market coupled with cuts in the capital gains tax rate is a big one.</p>
<p>But the big take-away&#8230;  the tax system is regressive.   Its becoming less regressive, but its still regressive.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Update&#8230; As noted at the very top of the post, I must have been hallucinating when I wrote this.  Conclusions in this post are incorrect.  Sorry about that.</p>

<blockquote><p>The new assessment concludes that Iran actually suspended its covert nuclear weapon program in the fall of 2003. That tends to undercut Bush’s recent warnings about the danger of “World War III” if Iran’s nuclear ambitions are realized.</p>
<p>At least the first half-dozen questions were related to the issue, with several reporters bluntly questioning whether Bush has exaggerated the danger from Tehran, especially in recent months. Several also sought to link the flip-flop on Iran intelligence to earlier U.S. intelligence miscues over Iraq. “Can’t you be accused of hyping this threat?” asked NBC’s David Gregory. “And don’t you worry that that undermines U.S. credibility?”</p>
<p>In response, Bush pointed out repeatedly that the new intelligence shows that U.S. diplomatic pressure actually has been working. He added that Iran remains a danger because of its demonstrated desire for a nuclear arsenal, as well as its continuing uranium-enrichment program, which could provide material for constructing a weapon. He also said he’d only been informed about the re-evaluation within the past week. Intelligence officials had told him earlier that there was a new development. But they weren’t being specific until they’d checked it out, Bush said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The president also took the time to push for the trade bill with Peru as a way to fight terrorism, which is up for a vote today or tomorrow, calling it free trade again, instead of the WTO GATS modeled capital flow and nothing else trade bill.  While the presidential candidates are mostly for it, they probably will be absent on the vote.</p>

                                <p>A few commenters of my last post suggested that picking at the tax code can create big problems if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I agree. Why mess with what is working as evident in the data continuously collected and reported concerning the economy. But, in 1981 they did mess with it and in a very big way and it hasn&#8217;t stopped. As the saying goes “everything changed”. Even under Clinton the share of income to the top 1% rose 6 points.<br />To recall, my point is that it&#8217;s not just the rates that are the problem, it&#8217;s the code.<br />One comment got me looking further.</p>
<p>Save the Rust Belt<br />“In general, the attempts by Congress in various bills to limit the deductibility of executive compensation caused the flood of executive stock options, and created a much bigger mess “<br />From a review by <a href="http://www.fpanet.org/journal/articles/1981_Issues/upload/9554_1.pdf">Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &#038; Co</a>.<br />
<blockquote><em>The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 is the most comprehensive tax reform<br />since 1954.</em>  It affects virtually every financial planning decision.  The  Act creates a <em>&#8220;new” type of stock option</em> known as an &#8220;Incentive Stock Option&#8221; under which favorable tax treatment will be afforded to the option holder if certain conditions are met. Under current law, employer stock options are not entitled to preferential treatment.<br /><strong>Observations<br /></strong>The incentive stock option will have a significant effect on compensation planning<br />for all companies, and these rules may be applicable to options already exercised in 1981. Incentive stock option plans <em>will probably become the cornerstone of executive compensation plans involving capital accumulation.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>(Within this report are the changes related to the savings and loan mess. Considering today&#8217;s subprime problems, it is rather instructive as it relates to learning from history. Start on page 39 of the document.)</p>
<p>Thus, it was not the messing around that created stock options as a preferential means of payment.  In the<a href="http://www.allbusiness.com/glossaries/economic-recovery-tax-act-1981-erta/4960332-1.html"> 1986 messing </a>around they: eased the rules for exercise of Incentive Stock Option (ISO).</p>
<p>But, how was this 1981 act being portrayed by the CBO? <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/51xx/doc5136/doc04b-Entire.pdf">Baseline Budget Projections for Fiscal Years 1983 – 1987 </a>  Report February 1982<br />
<blockquote>The CBO baseline economic forecast shows an early end to the current recession and an acceleration of economic growth following the July tax cut.<br />Baseline revenue projections assume no change in current tax laws,&#8230; Under the CBO baseline economic assumptions, revenues are projected to rise from an estimated $631 billion in fiscal year 1982 to $882 billion in 1987. This represents an average growth of 6.9 percent a year, compared with an assumed average growth in nominal GNP of about 10 percent a year for the projection period. As a consequence, revenues as a proportion of GNP are projected to decline from 20.6 percent in 1982 to 17.7 percent in 1987—<strong>the smallest ratio since 1965</strong>. </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Under current tax laws, the greatest growth in revenues will occur in social insurance taxes and contributions&#8230; The share of total revenues raised from this source will increase from 33 percent in 1982 to 38 percent by 1987&#8230;  The share of total revenues raised from individual income taxes would<strong> decline from 47.5 percent to 45percent.</strong> Corporate income taxes under current laws and CBO&#8217;s baseline economic assumptions are projected, to increase by 46 percent, &#8230; and to maintain its 8 percent relative share of total revenues. Revenues raised from excise taxes and other sources are projected to remain at about the same level during the projection period. As a result, their relative share of total revenues would fall from 11 percent in 1982 to 8 percent in 1987.</p></blockquote>
<p>How did this all work out?  <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/49xx/doc4954/doc10-Entire.pdf">THE CHANGING DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL TAXES: A CLOSER LOOK AT 1980</a>  Staff Working Paper July 1988</p>
<blockquote><p>As reported in the earlier CBO study, total effective tax rates (the ratio of taxes from all four sources to family income) rose between 1977 and 1984 for the 10 percent of families at the lowest end of the distribution and fell for the 10 percent of families at the highest. Overall, the distribution of total federal taxes became less progressive.<br />Between 1977 and 1980, the total effective tax rate for all four taxes combined declined for the 20 percent of families in the bottom of the income distribution and generally rose for the 50 percent of families in the upper end, except for the 10 percent of families with the highest incomes. Total effective tax rates for other family income classes changed little between 1977 and 1980. </p>
<p>Between 1980 and 1984, the total effective tax rate for all families taken together dropped noticeably, from 23.3 percent in 1980 to 21.7 percent in 1984. The decline was not uniform across all income classes, however. Effective tax rates rose for the 30 percent of families at the lowest end of the income distribution and fell for the 70 percent of families in the upper end, with the size of the reduction increasing with family income. The 10 percent of families at the highest end of the distribution had both the largest percentage and the largest absolute decrease in effective tax rates.</p>
<p>The changes in effective rates under the individual income tax resulted largely from the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA). ERTA substantially cut statutory tax rates and increased allowable deductions, but it failed to offset the effect on low-income families of an inflation-induced decline in the real value of personal exemptions, zero bracket amounts (standard deductions), and the earned income credit. </p>
<p><strong>By 1988, the distribution of combined federal taxes is projected to become more progressive than in 1984, but to remain less progressive than in either 1977 or in 1980.</strong> Although the combined effective tax rate for all families taken together is expected to drop slightly from 1980 to 1988, total effective federal tax rates are projected to be higher for families in the bottom half of the income distribution and lower for families in the top half. <strong>The largest reductions between 1980 and 1988 will be for the 1 percent of families with the highest incomes.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question I guess is: did they know what they were doing?  I suppose it depends on whether you think this results we have been living with since 1981 was intentional or not.</p>
<p>Just to cover the talking points:<br />
<blockquote>The share of taxes paid by the 10 percent of families with the highest incomes rose by between 1.0 and 1.5 percentage points between 1980 and 1988. The increase in the share of taxes paid by this group resulted from a growth of nearly 3 percentage points in their share of pre-tax income between 1980 and 1988, more than offsetting the decline in their effective tax rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>We changed everything.</p>

<p>As you stand with other parents watching the kids play soccer, discussing sports or the weather, and your body screams danger. Or a light touch makes you mentally jump a foot into the air as you return the caress. It is a hard tightrope to walk even when you know what is going on. Lack of sleep makes it impossible for some.</p>

<blockquote>Assessments of the many ways in which transitioning from high-stress combat war zones to a peaceful home community environment can be the hardest part of military service. Explaining the difficulties and what can be done to help are psychiatrist and author Jonathan Shay; VA psychiatrist Andrew Pomerantz; retired Navy psychologist Dennis Reeves; Col. Thomas Burke, director for mental health policy for the Dept. of Defense; Vietnam vet and VA counselor Jim Dooley; and Fred Gusman, a director of the VA National Center on PTSD.

                                <p><a href="http://publicagenda.org/">Public Agenda</a> is asking bloggers to contribute to a discussion on <a href="http://www.facingup.org/">the National Debt they call Facing Up</a>. These are my thoughts on the subject&#8230;</p>
<p>The White House’s Office of Management and Budget <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/hist.html">Table 7.1</a> shows data on the National Debt going back to 1940.  There’s gross debt, debt held by the public, debt held by Federal Government Accounts, and debt held by the Federal Reserve.  And the data is provided in dollars and as a percentage of GDP.  The size of the debt looks different depending on which measure one chooses.</p>
<p>So what is the most useful way to look at the size of debt?  Well, on the one hand, you don’t want to count money owed from one branch of the Federal government to another, so debt held by the public makes more sense than gross debt.  Furthermore, if the average person borrowed $1 million, they’d have some trouble paying it back, whereas Bill Gates would have no such issues.  Therefore, debt as a percentage of income makes more sense than debt in dollars.  </p>
<p>With all that said, here’s what Debt held by the Public as a percentage of GDP looks like, going back to 1940:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1VTl704KiI/AAAAAAAAA5I/foHks_jZkac/s1600-h/cactus+on+debt,+figure+1,+debt+as+a+percentage+of+GDP,+line+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1VTl704KiI/AAAAAAAAA5I/foHks_jZkac/s320/cactus+on+debt,+figure+1,+debt+as+a+percentage+of+GDP,+line+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The graph indicates that debt exploded with the start of World War 2 – by 1946, the debt, at 109% of GDP, was almost two and a half times greater than it was in 1940.  Presumably, a country fighting for its collective life could be excused in taking such a financial gamble.</p>
<p>After World War 2, the debt declined until 1974, bottoming out at just under 24% of GDP.  Since then, its generally risen… quickly in some years, not so quickly in others.  What’s the cause of this?  No doubt there are many, but one cause is obvious, when you play with the data a wee bit.  The graph below shows the Debt held by the Public as a percentage of GDP in the last full year of each Presidential administration, color coded by Political Party, following the end of World War 2:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1VTcr04KhI/AAAAAAAAA5A/eiYG-8gNNVY/s1600-h/cactus+on+debt,+figure+2,+debt+as+a+percentage+of+GDP,+bar+graph.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1VTcr04KhI/AAAAAAAAA5A/eiYG-8gNNVY/s320/cactus+on+debt,+figure+2,+debt+as+a+percentage+of+GDP,+bar+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And here is a slightly different look – the next graph shows the annualized percentage change in the Debt held by the Public as a percentage of GDP from the end of one administration to the end of the next:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1VTKr04KgI/AAAAAAAAA44/D5-YoS6fUfQ/s1600-h/cactus+on+debt,+figure+3,+annualized+change+in+debt+as+a+percentage+of+GDP,+bar+graph.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1VTKr04KgI/AAAAAAAAA44/D5-YoS6fUfQ/s320/cactus+on+debt,+figure+3,+annualized+change+in+debt+as+a+percentage+of+GDP,+bar+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Note… a negative decrease in the debt is, obviously, an increase in the debt.</p>
<p>The last five Democratic Presidents, Clinton, Carter, LBJ, JFK, and Truman all reduced the debt, and one has to go back sixty years to find a Democratic President who, facing the Great Depression and World War 2, allowed the debt to increase.  On the other hand, the last four Republican Presidents, GW Bush, GHW Bush, Reagan, and Ford all oversaw an increase in the country’s indebtedness.  It has been more than thirty years since a Republican President left office (albeit in a scandal) having reduced the National Debt.  In the last few decades, somewhere along the way, the Republican Party has become the Party of fiscal irresponsibility.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be that way.  Lord knows I’m no Republican, and it seems to me that many of what currently seem to be core Republican policies appear almost designed to increase the debt.  Even so, there’s still something in the Republican DNA that believes fiscal responsibility is a good thing.  All else being equal, Republican voters appear to prefer a lower debt over a higher one, and they seem to believe (even if that belief is mistaken) that they are more likely to get it from Republican politicians.  President Bush himself, in the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">Economic Blueprint for his Presidency</a>, promised to retire “an historic $2 trillion in debt over… 10 years.”  His debt-fighting plan was so ambitious that he expected annual surpluses to “outstrip the amount of maturing debt starting in 2007.”</p>
<p>But as he said elsewhere in his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">Economic Blueprint</a>, </p>
<blockquote><p>Government must be results-oriented—guided not by process, but by performance. There comes a time when programs must be judged by how well they achieve their purpose. Where we find success, we should reward it, and make it the standard. Government action that fails in its purpose must be reformed or ended.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its time to apply that standard to the policies that Republican politicians promise us will reduce the debt.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;you still have to evaluate borrower ability to pay. There is no way around it. It has to be done on a case-by-case basis.</p></blockquote>
<p>OldVet sends me an e-mail on this topic:</p>
<blockquote><p>Quote from Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Donald Kohn, Nov. 28, 2007.  The link is <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kohn20071128a.htm">here</a> FRB: Speech&#8211;Kohn, Financial Markets and Central Banking&#8211;November &#8230; .</p>
<blockquote><p>To be sure, lowering interest rates to keep the economy on an even keel when adverse financial market developments occur will reduce the penalty incurred by some people who exercised poor judgment. But these people are still bearing the costs of their decisions and we should not hold the economy hostage to teach a small segment of the population a lesson.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Still bearing the costs of their decisions?”  Are you kidding?  This is an unusual admission that events in financial markets rather than fundamental economic markets are now influencing Fed thinking about whether to lower or keep short term interest rates.  What is likely to happen?</p>
<p>If I’m reading the tea leaves correctly, the Fed will lower rates enough so most mortgages don’t “reset” to higher contractual rates that were part of the mortgage agreements.  There are other indicators as well that US, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119638615868608863.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Banks Near A Plan to Freeze sub-prime mortgage resets</a>.  The Treasury Department is elbow deep in that deal.  The deal is also making some analysts cranky as wolverines <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2007/11/temporary-mortgage-freeze-is-doomed.html">on a diet</a>.</p>
<p>How are the men and women who were more modest in their financial dealings, and are renting in order to save up a down payment?  How about the tens of millions of Americans who bought their house, have made their payments through thick or thin, and who paid attention to the loans they borrowed?  How are houses going to become more affordable if the US government props up prices?  The US government is certainly doing nothing to increases wages and incomes, which is a much sounder path to health in the housing market.</p>
<p>Here’s the plan, ladies and gentlemen:  A government sponsored program.  Banks continue to accept “teaser” rates of 2%-5% but beg Dubai to invest and agree to pay Dubai 11%, as did Citibank.  Does paying 11% and receiving 5% make sense, unless the Treasury Department is going to offer a bailout to “cooperating banks?”</p>
<p>Once you start the programs and bailouts, where does it stop?  Key clue:  Who’s running Washington?</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m probably more cynical than Yves Smith and OldVet put together.  And I&#8217;m pretty sure how this is going to turn out.  Those who made loans they shouldn&#8217;t have will get big tax breaks.  Those who bought loans they shouldn&#8217;t have will get big tax breaks.  Those who took out loans they shouldn&#8217;t have and manage to keep their homes will get big tax breaks.  (Those who took out loans they shouldn&#8217;t have and don&#8217;t manage to keep their homes &#8211; well, they&#8217;re being uncooperative, right?)</p>
<p>Those who in no way knowingly or directly participated in this mess will get&#8230; the bill for the tax breaks.</p>

                                <p>Regular readers may recall a post I had not long ago where I three in the towel and removed Norton Anti-Virus from both my machine and my mother&#8217;s machine though we each had several months left on our subscription.  I had been a long time user of Norton &#8211; since long before it was bought by Symantec, but the package had made both my machine and my mother&#8217;s painfully slow to open files and to turn on.  I&#8217;m talking about ten minutes to boot up when you turn it on.  (I have a lot of memory, so that&#8217;s not the issue.)  Also, every so often, the computer would simply freeze up and stay that way until the machine was turned off, which then means sitting around waiting another ten minutes for it to boot up again.</p>
<p>I tried the CA product, which was offered for free by my ISP, AT&#038;T, found it to be adequate for my needs.  I also bought a copy for my mother so she&#8217;d be on the same package I am.  (She often has questions that are easiest to answer on the phone if we both have the same package.)</p>
<p>Recently AT&#038;T indicated to me it was time to update my anti-Virus package, so I hit OK, and next thing I knew, a) it uninstalled CA and b) it installed Norton.  It seems  now AT&#038;T is providing users with Norton.  Imagine my delight.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Update.</p>
<p>My life just went from bad to worse.  I installed the CA product.  Then I tried to delete Norton.  I went to add and remove programs and removed everything that said Norton or Symantec.  And yet, when I boot it up, there it sits!  The previous time it was easy to uninstall this thing.  According to the add/remove program, there is no Norton on my machine, yet it boots itself up and is sitting right there at the lower right of my toolbar, smugly slowing down my computer.  Anyone have any ideas how I can get this thing off of my machine?</p>

                                <p>Noni Mausa <a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/article/281499">looks at this story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A video that shows Vancouver police officers Tasering Robert Dziekanski has now been viewed by at least 15 million people online.  </p>
<p>The video and news of Dziekanski&#8217;s subsequent death caused an international outcry and spurred debate about the use of the electro-shock weapon. But despite the fact that police in Canada and the United States have been using them quietly – if not entirely without consequence – since 1999, few people actually know what Tasers are, how they work and why police and other agencies have them.  </p>
<p>Fewer still are aware, as human rights advocates claim, that the weapon – intended to replace firearms in life-threatening situations – is more frequently used for &#8220;pain compliance.&#8221; That&#8217;s a euphemism for inflicting pain to get someone to do what you want.  </p>
<p>The development of the Taser can be traced to a NASA researcher named Jack Cover who, in 1969, started to develop a non-lethal weapon that could be used by police to control unruly suspects &#8230; Cover surmised that a high-voltage, low-ampere electric shock would disorient and disarm someone long enough for police to assume control &#8230;  </p>
<p>By 1974, he had created a device that featured a powerful battery pack attached to two darts with long, insulated wires. A blast from the handheld device sent the sharp darts flying at a target.  </p>
<p>When the darts connected to an object – like a human body – it completed a circuit and sent a current of electricity through the object. That kind of shock can interrupt most people&#8217;s central nervous systems profoundly enough to render them helpless. It&#8217;s extremely painful. But, since the human body can&#8217;t store electricity, its effects are temporary.  </p>
<p>Cover named the weapon Thomas A. Swift&#8217;s Electric Rifle (or Taser) after his childhood hero, an adventurous youth from early 20th-century comic books.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>When the weapon was finally approved for police use in 1998 – starting with the Orlando, Fla., force – it was quickly accepted and arrived in Canada the following year.  </p>
<p>Modern Tasers deliver a 50,000-volt shock for five seconds and the darts can penetrate up to four centimetres of clothing as far as 11 metres [35 feet] away.  </p>
<p>In interviews, police on both sides of the border were unanimously and enthusiastically in favour of the Taser as an essential piece of equipment.  </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fact of life that police are sometimes confronted by desperate, violent individuals,&#8221; said one Ontario officer who didn&#8217;t want to be named. &#8220;And it&#8217;s a good feeling to know that you can stop that kind of person without resorting to deadly force.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Studies in major cities in the U.S. – Canadian ones don&#8217;t make such information public – have consistently shown that the addition of Tasers to a police force&#8217;s arsenal leads to a significant drop in shootings by officers. In 2003, two years after introducing Tasers, Seattle reported its first full year without a shooting by police in 25 years.  </p>
<p>But the problem is that while Tasers may be considered a non-lethal alternative to firearms, they can kill people..</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Amnesty International … advocates a suspension of the Taser until a definitive study can set rules for its application and to end the use of Tasers when they are not replacing deadly force.  </p>
<p>&#8220;They are just so effective and so easy to use,&#8221; [a spokesman] said. &#8220;They can easily be abused.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Buxton points out that Taser Inc.&#8217;s own literature admits that 20 per cent of Taser use is for pain compliance. The officer who didn&#8217;t want to be named admitted that was the case, but that he&#8217;d never done it himself.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Pain compliance is an unfortunate fact of life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t expect people who really don&#8217;t want to be arrested to do what you need them to do just because you ask them.&#8221;  </p></blockquote>
<p>Noni Mausa continues:</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>What interested me most about this article was the headline, presenting nonlethal pain as a &#8220;dark lure&#8221; to the police, wasn&#8217;t really explored very much in the body of the article.  However, this was something I wondered about Tasers since they came into common use.  It seems to me that not many police would shoot someone with a bullet just out of pure irritation &#8211;so messy, so noisy, so definite&#8211; however they might use a Taser, especially since it is touted as harmless and typically tested on the police themselves.</p>
<p>Similar is a new riot control weapon I keep hearing bits and pieces about &#8212; the one which can be beamed over a crowd like a flashlight and which causes a feeling as though the persons skin was burning.  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6297149.stm">Here&#8217;s</a> a pretty complete article from the BBC from last January:   </p>
<blockquote><p>The prototype weapon was demonstrated at the Moody Air Force Base in Georgia.  </p>
<p>A beam was fired from a large rectangular dish mounted on a Humvee vehicle.  </p>
<p>The beam has a reach of up to 500m (550 yds) [about a third of a mile], much further than existing non-lethal weapons like rubber bullets.  </p>
<p>It can penetrate clothes, suddenly heating up the skin of anyone in its path to 50C. [122 ºF]</p>
<p>But it penetrates the skin only to a tiny depth &#8211; enough to cause discomfort but no lasting harm, according to the military.   </p></blockquote>
<p>This device might only be used at first to disperse hostile crowds etc., as the article proposes, however I can&#8217;t imagine it would be more than days or weeks before it was used as a kind of large-scale community pain compliance device with a &#8220;dark lure&#8221; of its own.</p>
<p>Government use of waterboarding, which is presented as not much worse than a fraternity prank, Tasering, which is presented as painful but harmless, and this &#8220;heat ray&#8221; also being presented as painful but harmless all make the same ideological point: &#8220;Pure pain does not matter, except as it is useful to cow and control ordinary, dispensable people.  If it leaves no marks, then there is no real harm and (even better) no proof.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;dark lure&#8221; is the lure of power, threat, even casual spite, without accountability.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In his op-ed piece today, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/opinion/03krugman.html?hp"> Krugman</a> aptly sums up the financial mess that is now brewing, that refuses to go away.</p>
<blockquote><p>And free-market orthodoxy dies hard. Just a few weeks ago Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, admitted to Fortune magazine that financial innovation got ahead of regulation — but added, &#8220;I don’t think we’d want it the other way around.&#8221; Is that your final answer, Mr. Secretary?</p></blockquote>
<p>As our manufacturing sector continues <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/business/business-usa-economy-manufacturing.html"> to decline</a>, America&#8217;s die-hard version of free-market capitalism and financial wizardry can claim success in exporting its toxic waste now buried cleverly in tranches and commercial paper, in, as Krugman says, a marvelous alphabet soup: CDO, SIV, RMBS, ABCP.</p>
<p>The fear is: Have the greedy wizards this time undone themselves?</p>
<p>This writer has heard one scary story of a gentleman who tried to extract a medium size withdrawal from his sizable bank account. The cash was not readily available. What should have been a once easy wire transfer turned into a wrestling match. The main bank branch did not have the money; only a subsidiary branch at Walmart had enough cash on-hand.</p>
<p>Think of it: Walmart had the cash, but even Walmart would not cough it up without a fight. And, after it did, what did the wise Walmart manager tell our gentleman?</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly, I would not have an account anywhere of more than $100,000.&#8221; Yup. FDIC may have to trot to the rescue if this game worsens.</p>
<p>The Fed keeps pumping billions into the system, hoping to loosen up the logjam. No matter how clever the wizards are in packaging their goods, no matter how complicated and wonderful their calculus is, economics is finally quite simple: Money does not grow on trees. Hard work, real productive work, (manufacturing?) pays the dividends. Produce something; make something other than a piece of paper.</p>
<p>The wizards are nothing more than flim-flam artists, re-packaged versions of the old scam artists who sold the latest elixir to the local yokels.</p>
<p>Face it: I am pissed. Really pissed. Free, unregulated, markets are a scam.</p>
<p>Deregulation is just the slippery slope down which slippery monsters glide as they fleece us all. &#8220;I got a offer that is bound to make you rich,&#8221; they whisper. &#8220;In fact, you can actually buy insurance if you are worried!&#8221;</p>
<p>Re-read the Krugman quotation. Think carefully of Paulson&#8217;s answer. Paulson, now flush with billions in his own account, loves the system. Regulation should not anticipate or in anyway prohibit scams. Keep the dark corners available for innovation.</p>
<p>Think deeply about that. If a scam is made cleverly enough, complicated enough, opaque enough, then it is called &#8220;innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Krugman reports that poor Barnake had to be recently schooled in hedge funds. And if he had to be schooled, what about you and me? </p>
<p>Does <i>caveat emptor</i> really apply when one of the brightest among us, a PhD in economics, the chairman of the Fed, did not have a clue of what was happening? No <i>caveat emptor</i> arguments, please&#8230;unless you think you can explain the calculus in layman&#8217;s terms. And do not simply slur Barnake, unless you really think you know more than he does. Put the blame where it finally belongs.</p>
<p>In the olden days, such people, when discovered, were tarred and feathered, run out of town, or put in jail. A scam is a scam is a scam.</p>
<p>Ah, but the free marketers who hate regulations will say, &#8220;Hey! <i>Caveat emptor!</i>&#8221; Or, &#8220;Risk taking is the hallmark of American-style capitalism!&#8221;</p>
<p>Or, when the bubble crashes and the government has problems cleaning up the mess, they will surely scream, &#8220;See, the government failed you again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, you will hear all these arguments, especially the last one: &#8220;The government failed you.&#8221; That&#8217;s the one argument they want you to believe; they need you to believe if they are to be able to continue their clever shell games.</p>
<p>Think back to the fiasco of the toxic toys from China. Was Mattel really at fault? They were doing what they do best: Fleecing toddlers. As long as profits were high, Mattel did not give a hoot about the quality of its toys. Profits are the name of the game.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s to blame? Well, we all blamed those wily Chinese. Mattel blamed them; then apologized! Mattel knew who was really buttering its toast: China&#8211;low taxes, cheap labor, and no regulations. And the WTO gave its blessing. (Don&#8217;t you think it is about time that we really looked at the WTO? I have been singing that song for three years now. No one listens.)</p>
<p>Yes, finally, journalists discovered that our government did not have enough inspectors. Ah, they wisely concluded: it was OUR government&#8217;s fault! </p>
<p>But why were there few inspectors? The answer is simple; we have heard it preached endlessly since Reagan: Get the government out of business. Deregulate. Deregulate! Let those amazing entrepreneurs weave their wondrous webs. Sarbanes-Oxley? Ugh. Think about trade agreements? Ugh. Think about transparency in finance? Ugh.</p>
<p>And who really was the flim-flam artist in the toy game? Mattel, of course! They found the cheap labor and the country with no regulatory controls. Did this concern Mattel? Of course it didn’t. Precisely the opposite: It pleased them. Got them the money, honey.</p>
<p>But free marketers will cleverly rejoin: &#8220;Well, the market caught up with them.&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, I don’t buy that answer, not when my kids are at risk. And I certainly do not buy it when my bank account is at stake!</p>
<p>Now we have offshore hedge funs with which the banks have played footsy&#8211;not only banks, but pension funds and small and large municipalities&#8230;. And where was the Fed, where was our government? In the hands of the free marketers: Paulson, Greenspan, and company. They gave the newly minted loan sharks carte blanche. </p>
<p>Innovation, they called it. I call it greed, greed, greed&#8230;unregulated greed.</p>
<p>Slippery slopes make slippery monsters. If we do not get our government out of the hands of the corporate lobbyists, out of the hands of the free marketers, we will all be asking: &#8220;Who&#8217;s got the money, honey?&#8221; Better check your bank account.</p>
