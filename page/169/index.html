<p>Nader Argues for a Financial Transactions Tax
<p>Ralph Nader provided an op-ed on the question of a financial transaction tax, &#8220;Time for a Tax on Speculation,&#8221; Wall St. Journal, A17 (Nov. 2, 2011).  He ties the need for the tax as a curb to speculation to the growing concern among ordinary Americans about corporate power and Wall Street excesses.</p>
<p>A financial transactions tax would impose a small charge on the value of stock, bond and derivatives transactions&#8211;probably somewhere around 0.25% to 0.5% (the latter is the figure pushed by Nader and groups like National Nurses United). Such a tax would raise a considerable amount of money and at the same time serve another important function&#8211;curbing speculative and high-frequency trading.</p>
<blockquote><p>[This tax] has the potential to curb risky speculative trading that contributes little real economic value.  The Capital Institute&#8217;s John Fullerton has stated that a financial speculation tax could have a significant impact on the high-frequency trading and other &#8216;quant&#8217; trading strategies that now comprise an astonishing 70% of vastly bloated equity-trading volume. <a name="more"></a> Over the past few decades, trading volume has grown exponentially.  In 1995, the total shares of stock traded on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, not including derivates and other options, was 188 billion.  By the peak of the financial crisis, in 2008, this annual number had skyrocketed to three trillion.</p>
<p>*** Sen. Harkin, Rep. DeFazio and others in the past few years have proposed protecting ordinary investors from the direct effects of the tax by providing exemptions for mutual funds, retirement funds and for the first $100,000 in trades made annually by an individual</p>

                                <p>Unless you&#8217;re really stupid, or bending over backwards to find excuses for the Obama Administration&#8217;s Geithnerian malfeasance, you should be less than impressed with <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/11/matthew-yglesiass-theory-of-the-obama-administration-in-2010-excessive-reliance-on-the-second-derivative.html">Matt Yglesias&#8217;s attempt to argue that the Administration saw reason to be happy with overall employment</a> (link to Brad DeLong).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re Matt Yglesias, you should be even less impressed with your (own) argument.</p>
<p>Because Matt Yglesias was paying attention in 2010. He was paying much more attention to Barack Obama&#8217;s speeches than I was, so he would have heard the 27 January 2010 State of the Union, when <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address">Barack Obama said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[O]ur efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt. That, too, is a fact.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do. But families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. <strong>The federal government should do the same.</strong> (Applause.) So tonight, I&#8217;m proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year.<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><strong>Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years.</strong> (Applause.) Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will not be affected. <strong>But all other discretionary government programs will.</strong> Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don&#8217;t. And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will. (Applause.) [emphases mine; laugh track in original]</p></blockquote>
<p>And Matt Yglesias, who was paying attention then and has a memory now, would have known that &#8220;freezing government spending in 2011&#8221; means starting 1 October 2010 (when FY 2011 starts), which means that departments have to start planning and cutting&#8230;well, basically when the words leave Obama&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>And Matt Yglesias would have known that transfer payments such as Unemployment Insurance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Home Energy Assistance Program, and other programs that (at the least) enable &#8220;discretionary&#8221; spending on things such as food, clothing, and medicine are not on the list of programs that will be exempted from funding cuts. So—even ignoring any moral considerations about letting people freeze to death or starve—there&#8217;s a cut in consumption (and therefore GDP) coming. Which will impact employment.</p>
<p>And Matt Yglesias would have known that freezing Federal spending—which is what Obama really means, since he doesn&#8217;t control the States&#8217;s spending directly—means that the States that are at best just starting to recover, and that have to balance their budget somehow, and <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/texas-politics/campaign-rhetoric-obscures-facts-about-federal-money-172606.html">only did it for the then-current fiscal year with the help of a lot of stimulus</a> that won&#8217;t be coming from a frozen government budget. So there will be cuts in civil servants, and more cuts in consumption.</p>
<p>And Matt Yglesias would have known that freezing the Federal budget in the midst of a slow recovery (because even Matt&#8217;s first graphic doesn&#8217;t come close to the stable-unemployment rate of 110-150,000 new jobs a month at the time of the SotU, and only approaches it later because it includes temporary census hiring) means that there will have to be layoffs at the Federal level as well, even if there is no one (contrary to economic theory) who leaves for the private sector.</p>
<p>And Matt Yglesias—who isn&#8217;t as dumb as his post makes him seem—would know that an Administration that says something that stupid in 2010 isn&#8217;t looking at his second (more clearly understandable) graphic, or even his first (census-enhanced) graphic, but rather so mythological construct where all those government workers and increasingly-impoverished unemployed people magically Create Jobs.</p>
<p>And Matt Yglesias—not to mention Brad DeLong—would not be at all surprised when the result of those early 2010 policies came home to roost:
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P8dYnvXEzRI/TrggnQfgXOI/AAAAAAAAApc/Vz3-vdVlV2M/s1600/firstderivative.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P8dYnvXEzRI/TrggnQfgXOI/AAAAAAAAApc/Vz3-vdVlV2M/s320/firstderivative.png" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Indeed, the reaction might well be that the recovery went even better than should have been expected, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/28/september-personal-saving-rate_n_1063516.html">to wonder why</a>.</p>
<p>And Matt Yglesias would, instead of making excuses for them, wonder <strong>aloud</strong> why any capable economist (or even one of the Administration&#8217;s policy guru) would have been stupid enough to take the first chart he presented seriously as a roadmap, since the Administration changed the territory—for the worst, from an employment perspective—from the previous model. He would be asking if Austan Goolsbee—who is smarter than both Matt and myself, and possibly the two of us combined—was just sleeping through the entire Administration.</p>
<p>But Matt Yglesias didn&#8217;t do any of those things. Why, oh why, can&#8217;t we have a better press corps?(tm, Brad DeLong)</p>

<p>The right&#8217;s nutty claims about job creation&#8211;Gingrich and the estate tax
<p>The right is busy selling its program for enriching the rich to the working class.  As usual, the sales pitches are full of false and nutty claims pitched to fool hard workers who are uninformed about the facts.</p>
<p>Newt Gingrich, for example, pitched the claim that eliminating the estate tax that applies only to the biggest multimillion dollar estates&#8211;a large tax cut applicable only to the uberrich silver-spoon kids who do nothing to earn the largesse&#8211;will cause all kinds of wondrous economic changes.   See &#8220;To create Jobs, abolish the death tax now&#8221; (The Newt Gingrich Letter).</p>
<p>These claims are based on a  so-called &#8220;study&#8221; by the American Family Business Foundation (put in quotes, since this is a paid &#8220;study&#8221; by  a propaganda tank that asks family businesses of the kind that might have to pay the tax whether they would create more jobs if they didn&#8217;t have to pay the tax, and gets the not at all unsurprising self-serving answer that &#8220;oh yes, we&#8217;d have more jobs with fewer taxes&#8221;.)   So the study and Gingrich make pie-in-the-sky claims that</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<ul>
<li>the US government would actually take in more tax revenues by getting rid of the millionaires &#038; billionaires&#8217; estate tax&#8211;even claiming a specific number of $362 billion more in taxes.  (It helps if the persons answering the self-serving survey give numbers that can be used to make these specific type of claims.) </li>
<li>Gross Domestic Product would increase by 2.26% just by eliminating the tax </li>
<li>New revenues from the &#8220;economic activity that would result from the elimination of the [estate] tax&#8221; would be twice as much as the revenue gained from the current estate tax; </li>
<li>the economic growth from eliminating the estate tax would &#8220;create thousands of new jobs as families kept more small businesses running through mutliple generations and shifted their efforts from avoiding estate taxes to investing in America&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Balderdash</p>
<p>Eliminating the estate tax won&#8217;t create new economic growth, new investment in jobs, save family businesses or divert monies now spent on tax evasion to worthwhile domestic investments.  Most of the claims in articles like Gingrich&#8217;s or in &#8220;studies&#8221; like the self-serving American Family Business Foundation are unfounded, based on absurd assumptions or simply made up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Estate tax reduction or repeal doesn&#8217;t lead to growth</strong>.  We have cut taxes on estates enormously in the last decade and growth has stagnated, with none of the benefits going to the vast middle and lower classes.  There&#8217;s no empirical evidence supporting the self-serving claims that such a tax cut helps growth.  In fact, evidence on inequality in societies supports exactly the opposite conclusion&#8211;the more we allow spendthrift heirs to take over family fortunes tax free and accumulate even more wealth, the worse it is for economic growth and societal wellbeing. </li>
<li><strong>Estate tax reduction or repeal doesn&#8217;t create jobs</strong>.  Money saved from taxes doesn&#8217;t automatically get plowed back into businesses in a way that creates jobs.  It&#8217;s more likely to get plowed into private equity funds (that strip companies of their employees and load them up with debt in order to resell them at great gain for the equity investors and great loss of jobs) or invested in emerging market economies to diversify portfolios.  Most use of excess funds by the wealthy, that is, benefits the wealthy at little or no good to society and in fact often with considerable harm to society in terms of job loss </li>
<li><strong>Estate tax repeal doesn&#8217;t &#8220;save&#8221; family businesses, because they aren&#8217;t at risk from the estate tax in the first place.</strong>  Very Very few (if any) family businesses are lost to the estate tax.  There is a provision in the Code allowing installment payments over 14 years to ensure that family farms can stay in business by paying the estate tax out of annual incomes.  The argument about loss of family businesses is invented to appeal to those who do not understand the very limited number of estates subject to the tax in the first place (fewer than 2%). </li>
<li><strong>Estate tax repeal doesn&#8217;t prevent sales of family businesses upon death of the founder&#8211;and those sales are often a good thing!</strong>  Many times, family businesses are sold upon the death of the founder because nobody in the family wants to run it anymore&#8211;they want to take their cash and go live their own lives.   That&#8217;s probably not a bad result for the economy&#8211;new management will tend to see opportunities that the old business had ignored.  All repeal of the estate tax would do would be to put more money in the hands of heirs who do nothing to deserve it. </li>
<li><strong>Estate tax repeal isn&#8217;t needed to avoid &#8220;double taxation.&#8221;</strong>  Gingrich tries to make the case, quoting Petter Ferrara as follows:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The [estate] tax taxes yet again a lifetime of savings and investment that has already been taxed multiple times.  It is double taxation on top of double taxation, which often forces loved ones left behind to sell the family farm, ranch or business to pay the taxes just when they are suffering from their loss the most.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not so.  Many estates have as their primary assets investment securities that represent considerable appreciation that has NEVER been taxed.  Elimination of the estate tax means that even this &#8220;last chance&#8221; for getting a single tax bite would be eliminated.  Many of the biggest estates represent passage of stock from one generation to another with almost no taxation along the way.  Whereas workers pay tax on every single dollar earned and have little ability to use their salaries as collateral for big investment plays, wealthy heirs of financial assets can use their assets as collateral for loans to &#8220;monetize&#8221; their wealth without taxation.  Most substantial family farms and ranches are now incorporated, with use of various schemes to zero out corporate income and pay no taxes (especially, e.g., depreciation of equipment and &#8220;salaries&#8221; for family members and corporate ownership of personal residences resulting in widespread ability to deduct personal expenses not possible to ordinary wage workers).  Double taxation is a fabricated myth for most of these estates.  As Leona Helmsley famously stated&#8211;only little people pay taxes.</p>
<p>And of course, as already noted, the sales are usually because they WANT to sell, since family farms have 14 years in which to use the income from the business to pay off any (usually small) estate tax due.  Remember that the effective estate tax rate is usually very very low, given the very large current exemption amount.  Only the estate above the multi-million dollar exemption amount is subject to tax, and the rate right now is inordinately low and there are numerous accepted and simple mechanisms, such as family limited partnerships and other devices, which result in much lower evaluations than fair market value under current warped rules.</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, it is important to note the many beneficial effects of the estate tax:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the estate tax provides revenues to help combat significant budget deficits.  Those deficits have</strong> been substantially created by two problems&#8211;wars being fought without the normal tax increases to fund them, and tax cuts even when those cuts created hundreds of billions of dollars in annual deficits. </li>
<li><strong>the estate tax is a slightly redistributive mechanism to counter the upwards redistribution that is the norm in our current economic system.  </strong>CEOs get golden parachutes for ruining companies, and bankers and managers take all the benefits of worker productivity gains.  Ordinary employees are denied the right to form a union by every employer trick imaginable and by the right&#8217;s unwillingness to let card check become law.  Workers therefore end up scraping by on a combination of devalued wages and debt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping the estate tax, and making it more progressive so that the estates of the uberrich are appropriately taxed under &#8220;ability to pay&#8221; concepts regarding the marginal utility of the dollar, is the fair thing to do. And it would have a stimulative effect on the economy by providing revenues for governmental infrastructure and other projects.  Counter to Gingrich&#8217;s claim, repealing the estate tax would be a further step backward  to the robber barons&#8217; gilded age.  Let&#8217;s not take that step.</p>

<p><i>“Occupy” Annual Meetings and Court Rooms</i></p>
<p>The spectacular fall and bankruptcy of Jon Corzine’s MF Global Holdings within clear sight of mostly inactive regulators reminds us that “the system is still far too vulnerable and the work of regulatory reform far from finished,” to quote a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/opinion/mr-corzines-big-bet-on-mf-global.html?ref=editorials">NEW YORK TIMES</a> editorial on the subject . But, how to continue regulatory reform in a world in which one House of Congress is controlled by anti-regulatory zealots and existing regulators are too often afflicted by chronic DC/NY revolving door syndrome?  </p>
<p>In frustration, President Obama has finally begun using Executive Orders to try to accomplish more positive economic change. And, as we all know, he was preceded and prodded by the growing ranks of the Occupy Wall Street movement spreading nationwide and into Europe. <a name="more"></a>     <br />As their visibility and perceived importance of OWS increase, more arm chair generals (me included) are putting forth a lengthening agenda of reforms we hope protestors will demand. One percipient OWS observer hit a big nail on the head when he identified the following economic pressure point progressives should slam: </p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>“If I had to give the Occupy Wall Street movement a piece of advice, I would tell them to focus their growing chorus against Wall Street excesses on corporate governance reform. . . . [That] may sound innocuous, or tedious, or overly academic, but if this movement wants to put the fear of God into the corporate chieftains who are looking down from their towers in Manhattan at the masses below, needs to take the time to explain to its foot soldiers exactly how power is wielded in a modern corporation.” </p></blockquote>
<p>That suggestion from Kris Broughton, an independent journalist, blogger and national media commentator who also uses the moniker “brown man thinking.” (See <a href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/40697">http://bigthink.com/ideas/40697</a> ) And, his African-American heritage may have informed his choice of this agenda item usually overlooked by progressives. But, it was activism by individual and institutional investors (in the form of company annual meeting ballot initiatives and shareholder voting and litigation) that helped end the abomination of legal racial oppression and separation of races in South Africa, and achieve expansion of civil rights at home.    <br />Shareholder Activists Help Defeat Apartheid .</p>
<p>One of the first effective blows against apartheid in South Africa by the international community was wielded by the Episcopal Church in 1971. As a shareholder in General Motors Corporation, then a profitable corporate behemoth standing astride the world, instead of ignoring the voting rights its share ownership bestow, the Church:  </p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>“introduced a shareholder proposal . . . requesting that General Motors cease operations in South Africa, a nation then enforcing a very strict apartheid, including total separation by race in the workplace (jobs, pay, drinking fountains, etc). The registrant’s [General Motors’ subsequent] proxy statement [mailed to all shareowners] revealed that one of GM’s directors, the Rev. Leon Sullivan, had voted against the Board’s decision to oppose the [South African] shareholder proposal. At the annual meeting, Rev. Sullivan came down from the dais and spoke in favor of the shareholder proposal. The upshot of the ‘conflict’ on GM’s Board was the creation, by a coalition led by General Motors, but consisting of almost all of the major U.S. corporations operating in South Africa, of the ‘Sullivan Principles,’ a code of conduct to abolish apartheid in their South African workplaces.”(See more at: <a href="http://www.iccr.org/">www.iccr.org</a> , the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility.) </p></blockquote>
<p>  That radical and successful non-violent action initiated by a mainstream Christian denomination ultimately led faith-based organizations from virtually all major religions within the United States to form The Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR). Today, it is comprised of 275 members and affiliates &#8212; including faith-based institutional investors such as pension funds, foundations, hospital corporations, economic development funds, asset management companies and colleges &#8212; that have investment portfolios collectively valued at more than $100 billion. They own shares in most major corporations and actively use the governing rights those shares convey to promote honest and socially responsible management of companies in which they invest. ICCR board member Jeffrey Dekro of Jewish Funds for Justice, for instance, is a catalyst for investment in low-income community development.</p>
<p>  <i>Fighting Capitalist “Heresies” With Capital     </i><br />Back in 2002, when most investors and citizens were still angry from the last round of egregious corporate fraud and abuse (think Enron, Global Crossing, WorldCom, Adelphia Communications, etc), the<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/21/business/private-sector-missionary-among-the-executives.html?scp=1&#038;sq=shareholder+activism+and+apartheid&#038;st=nyt"> NEW YORK TIMES</a> reported on the interfaith group’s shareholder activism by focusing on ICCR executive Sister Patricia Daly, a member of the Catholic Dominican order: </p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sister Daly views her work as following in the tradition of the Dominican order, founded in the 13th century by St. Dominic to fight heresies and untruths. ‘We’re dealing with some of the heresies and untruths of capitalism,’ Sister Daly said.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Risk Metrics Group, a profit-making associate member of Sister Daly’s ICCR, provides research and advice to governments, corporations, academics, institutional investors and others seeking unbiased actionable information on securities markets and companies that issue securities. Although recently acquired by a larger consulting firm (Institutional Investor Services, Inc.), Risk Metrics remains a leader in providing clients with decision-making data on corporate governance matters. And, the number of institutional investors willing and interested in fostering corporate management reform has expanded far beyond the ranks of the faith-based.
</p>
<p><i>“Short-term Profit Maximization is not a Sustainable Model”</i>   </p>
<p>In an interview, Lucas Green, an attorney and a research director for Institutional Investor Services Inc.’s corporate governance unit, said socially aware shareholders can and should exert a positive influence on how corporations are governed. Today, institutions – particularly pension funds serving employees, academic personnel and union members – are using more than proxy ballots to force change at poorly and dishonestly governed companies. They are going to Federal court, where, like civil rights activists and environmentalists before them, they use class actions to unite all shareholders in tackling a corporation’s embedded executives. </p>
<p>Admittedly, the prospect of strategic corporate proxy battles, institutional investor led litigation, and such key “corporate governance” issues as management compensation packages are enough to make the eyes of many OWS protestors (and most other citizens) glaze over. But, the ISS’s Lucas Green explains how the interests of Main Street are aligned with some of the nation’s largest public and union pension funds pushing for real change:   </p>
<blockquote><p>“One only has to look back to the Enron, WorldCom and more recent scandals to see the relevance of how corporations are governed to the interests of all investors including individuals and the overall health of our economy. Experience demonstrates that a corporate structure that places the highest value on short term profit maximization and short term stock price gain is not a sustainable model. Executive compensation packages should encourage long-term, sustainable growth and health.</p>
<p>“The interests of public pension funds, which are often among the largest investors in any given corporation and which seek effective, honest corporate governance focusing on the long term, are aligned with the public interest in several ways. The beneficiaries of pension funds themselves are typically individual employees and, more broadly, the funds in their role as big investors can also exert a positive influence on securities markets and the economy.”   </p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Adjusting United Healthcare’s Moral Compass    </i><br />As an example, in his lengthy paper on litigation in corporate governance, Mr. Green cites a lawsuit led by the California Public Employee’s Retirement System (CALPERS), a huge pension fund with about $236 billion in assets under management, that helped force extensive reform in the way the giant healthcare insurer United Healthcare Group, Inc. is managed. (See Green’s study at <a href="http://blog.issgovernance.com/slw/author/luke-green-1/">http://blog.issgovernance.com/slw/author/luke-green-1/</a> )  </p>
<p>A few years ago, amid a federal investigation (in 2006) into the illegal back-dating of stock options to enrich senior United Health managers, a separate New York State Investigation (in 2008) of alleged fraud in consumer healthcare billing, and other allegations of fraud in the sale of its securities to investors, CALPERS and other investors successfully pursued a class action against United Health in federal court that in 2009 won the following:   <br />&#8212; $925.5 million for allegedly defrauded shareholders;   <br />&#8212; creation of a more independent board of directors to exercise better oversight of United Health management;   <br />&#8212; reform of United Health executive compensation packages to discourage future wrongdoing.   <br />Pension Funds Can Do Better Than SEC at Thwarting Wrongdoing   <br />Ample research in recent years demonstrates that class action lawsuits led by such powerful investors as CALPERS can achieve better results at holding wrongdoers financially accountable and in deterring future misbehavior than even the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For nearly a decade, two law professors, James Cox of Duke University, and Randall Thomas of Vanderbilt, have studied the role of institutional investor-led lawsuits in combating fraud and other corporate abuse. In a joint paper published last year, they concluded:</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>“[P]rivate suits headed by an institutional lead plaintiff . . . appear to [target bigger corporate wrongdoers and achieve] better settlements and lower attorneys&#8217; fees awards   <br />[than lawsuits led by individual investors]. SEC enforcement efforts, while significant, have tended to focus on weaker [and smaller corporate malefactors as] targets, suggesting that the big fish get away.” </p></blockquote>
<p><i>What Can Peasants Do When Pitchforks are Parried by Police?</i>   <br />What can individual citizens – including our OCW surrogates serving at the front &#8212; do to reform corporate governance? The fortunate few who are still covered by pension funds   <br />should contact their funds’ managers and encourage them to join the fight for reform. Citizens who are active in Christian, Jewish, Muslim and other faith-based organizations should ask their religious leaders to mobilize congregate financial resources and inherent strength in numbers of individuals to challenge corporate crime in both shareholder meetings and courts.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The current consensus is that Berlusconi is toast, or, as Krugman would say, Crostini.</p>
<p>It is a bit risky to change horses in mid crisis and change Prime ministers in mid stream, but Berlusconi is a large part of the reason no one trusts Italy. Also everyone is totally sick of him especially his closest allies.</p>
<p>update update: The evidence that Berlusconi is falling is now somewhat stronger.  The opposition parties are now discussing who they might support as Prime minister of a government of national unity.  Basically the question is whether they will accept a member of Berlusconi&#8217;s inner circle so long as he is not Berlusconi or whether they demand Mario Monti.  They are suggesting that they will stand firm (yeah sure tell me about it).</p>
<p>La Repubblica is confusing me.  The headline and abstract guy suggests that UDC the wimply centrist ex Berlusconi allied party is ruling out a government lead by Berlusconi&#8217;s right hand man Gianni Letta &#8220;L&#8217;Udc (video) chiude a un incarico a Gianni Letta.&#8221; That is the UDS is rejects a nomination of Gianni Letta.  But the linked article says that the not quite so wimpy center-left main opposition party, the Democratic party PD, insists on someone untainted by Berlusconi (when asked, in effect, do you mean Monti, PD general secretary Bersani noted that the decision about who to ask to try to form a government is made by the President of the Republic, or in plain English yes.</p>
<p>OK now video.  The video does not make the advertized veto.  It is amusing as it shows the totally spineless center right long term Berlusconi ally P Casini advocating &#8220;revolution&#8221; but he in the video he doesn&#8217;t rule out a revolution lead by Berlusconi&#8217;s right hand man Letta.  Also the revolution is a revolution in the cause of austerity which is achieved by national unity and by ending intra-Italian conflict.  </p>
<p>Huh you ask ?  How can a revolution be an alternative to conflict ?  The fact is that this abuse of Italian is about average for around here.  A &#8220;revolution&#8221; is &#8220;a very big improvement,&#8221; not, you know, a revolution.  So Casini doesn&#8217;t even understand how absurd it is to talk about all parties united in the name of austerity as a revolution.  The video does show that Italy&#8217;s leading daily isn&#8217;t up to angrybearblog editorial standards, but it is funny*.  Imagine George Bush talking about the importance of knowledge and expertise.  </p>
<p>* Before anyone else mentions it, I admit that they do spell words correctly.  My spell checker keeps telling me that I am not typing correctly spelled Italian.  I can&#8217;t spell, but I usually find some way to get a computer to check my spellling (my computer isn&#8217;t working and I am embezzling the services of the computer which the Italian Public bought for Elisabetta&#8217;s research).</p>

                                <div><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson.html">This is a 16 minute</a> * lecture by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_G._Wilkinson">Richard Wilkinson</a>.  It is posted at TED.  I am posting it here, as I can not believe this information has not received more attention now that the US is awakening from the decades long delusion of prosperity which did not and as shown in the lecture could not lead to greater justice (which implies equality) via the model of economics we have been using. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The model known by many aliases (Chicago School, Friedman, etc) has resulted in the thought that people are drowning in debt and that we have privatized the profits but socialized the losses. These are inaccurate metaphors. They are the results of the language of the delusion we have been living for 3 decades and thus by definition can not capture the truth of our condition. As the science presented in the lecture shows, if our all encompassing concern should be equality, then people are not drowning, they are <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/monetary-policy-im-not-only-not-feeling.html">dehydrating</a>. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The dehydration is the results of privatizing security in life and socializing the risks in life. We are not “drowning” in risk or losses. We of the 99% are lacking in the substance that reduces risk. One can certainly drown from too much water, but the natural risk in life is not having too much water, it is having too little. Thus is the realization of the delusional statement “drowning in debt” and “socialized the losses”. </div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>The lack of reduction of life&#8217;s risks is the inequality, the social injustice&#8230;the diversion from the purpose expressed in the preamble to our Constitution. “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>The following <a href="http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/wilkinsoninequality.html">concluding statement</a> from a different lecture by Professor Wilkinson summarizes the TED lecture. As you watch the lecture keep in mind the 4 goals I highlighted of the preamble and consider that they were put into a document that created an government 223 years ago this year (based on ratification). I have a greater respect for the intellect and their insight into the human experience of those who wrote and ratified our Constitution. </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>“For thousands of years the best way of improving the quality of human life has been to raise material living standards. We are the first generation to have got to the end of that process. No longer does economic growth improve health, happiness, or wellbeing. If we are to improve the real quality of life further, we have to direct our attention to the social environment and the quality of social relations. But rather than continuing to tackle each problem separately, by spending more on medical care, more on police, social workers and drug rehabilitation units, we now know that it is possible to improve the psychosocial wellbeing and social functioning of whole societies. <strong>The quality of social relations is built on material foundations &#8211; on the scale of the material inequalities between us</strong>.” </p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>With information such as this research and that of the<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html"> 2005 World Bank</a> paper on what produces wealth , considering our Constitution&#8217;s preamble, we should not be struggling looking for guidance as to what direction, what path, what solution we need for our self (our self as in We the People). </div>
