                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">Everett McKinley Dirksen (January 4, 1896 – September 7, 1969) was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">American</a> politician of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican Party</a>. He represented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois">Illinois</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> (1933–1949) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate">U.S. Senate</a> (1951–1969). As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_Senate">Senate Minority Leader</a> for a decade, he played a highly visible and key role in the politics of the 1960s, including helping to write and pass the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Housing_Act_of_1968">Open Housing Act of 1968</a>, both landmarks of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955%E2%80%931968)">civil rights</a> legislation. He was also one of the Senate&#8217;s strongest supporters of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a> and was known as &#8220;The Wizard of Ooze&#8221; for his oratorical style.</div>
<p>That’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Dirksen">the Wikipedia version</a> of how LBJ was able to get the Civil Rights Act through Congress in 1965.  But it’s inaccurate.  Here’s the accurate version: </p>
<div dir="ltr">Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the onus is on the president.</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">“You can’t do it without presidential leadership and we’re all hopeful he’ll be prepared to provide that leadership,” McConnell said. “The president needs to deliver his side.”</div>
<div dir="ltr">Other senators also cited the leadership meme.</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">“The point that was consistently made to the president was that in the absence of his leadership, issues that are important to the people of America will not be addressed,” [Sen. Jerry] Moran said. “I really think it was rather a bland conversation. No fireworks on either tone. This wasn’t memorable, it was the opposite of that.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Alexander brought up meetings between President Lyndon Johnson and GOP Senate leader Everett Dirksen.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“I told him that every great crisis in our history has been solved by presidential leadership or not at all,” he said. “I’ve been around here a long time and this is the kind of thing that used to happen when President Johnson would show up unexpectedly in Dirksen’s office for a drink because Dirksen wouldn’t go down to the White House. As a result the next year they passed the Civil Rights bill.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212;  <a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=2CD9DA5E-7756-456A-BC84-F8938FD974A3">Obama to Democrats: Chill out</a>, Manu Rafu, Kate Nocera, Jonathan Allen, Politico, yesterday</div>
<p>OK.  I grew up in a household with two liberal Democratic political junkies (my parents), one of them a journalist (horrors!), both of them lifelong Illinoisans, one of whose ancestors on both sides were Illinoisans dating back to not long after the Civil War.  </p>
<p>So I grew up knowing, for example, that the only thing “Jerksen” ever did in his political career, before his surprising aggressive support of the Civil Rights Act and his assistance to LBJ in the aftermath of the Kennedy assassination in getting it enacted, was to get the Marigold declared the official state flower (when he was a top State legislator, or something).  So all you Illinoisans who didn’t know that your state even has an official flower, and who are reading this post, must be glad you read AB occasionally, because now you know.  (I can also tell you extremely detailed information about, say, Chicago politics dating back to about the early 1900s, but you’ve had your Illinois-political-history fill for the day, I’m sure. And you’ll probably agree, as I do, that the Marigold is a pretty flower.  Even my mother, she of “Jerksen” coinage, agreed; she just didn’t think it was necessary to have an official state flower.)</p>
<p>My point in all this, of course, is that while Sen. Alexander has been around there a long time, that time isn’t quite long enough for him to know that, contrary to what he apparently thinks&#8211;or at least what his choice of analogy implies&#8211;Lyndon Johnson did not cave to the Republicans and finally agree reluctantly to support the Civil Rights Act.  Johnson himself actually strongly supported enactment of the Act and obtained the assistance of the Republican Senate Minority Leader in bringing along enough members of their respective parties to vote for it.  </p>
<p>That included, on Johnson’s part, persuading some Southern Democrats in the House and Senate to vote for it despite the very substantial risk to their own political careers, and, on Dirksen’s part, doing the same with Republicans from mostly-rural states.  And while he first had to persuade Dirksen himself, Dirksen was not going to be “primaried” by a Tea Party candidate, or by some “out there” equivalent of the 1960s.  Nor did he have to fear, as both McConnell and John Boehner do, the loss of their leadership roles if they, y’know, actually act as leaders.  </p>
<p>Nor is it clear that, had he had to worry about these things, he would have shown the leadership he showed, helping write two really strong, landmark civil rights laws and helping shepherd them through to enactment. There was no “compromise” in the enactment of the 1960s civil rights laws; the nature of those laws were, all or nothing.  Dirksen chose the “all” option.  McConnell and Boehner won’t even choose the “compromise” one, choosing a new  and ludicrous definition of “leadership”&#8211;one that they’ve sold to analysis-challenged members of the centrist punditry.  </p>
<p>Such as Ruth Marcus, who <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ruth-marcus-obama-has-to-be-dealmaker-in-chief/2013/03/14/9714cff4-8cce-11e2-b63f-f53fb9f2fcb4_story.html">writes today</a> in the Washington Post: </p>
<div dir="ltr">Speaking to [George] Stephanopoulos, the president sounded distinctly pessimistic about the prospects for such a bargain and disturbingly unconcerned about failing to reach one. That, he said, would be more missed opportunity than “crisis.”</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">Perhaps he’s posturing; if the president is seen as coveting a deal too much, he won’t be able to get the kind he wants. Perhaps it’s simple realism; Republicans’ refusal to consider revenue raised by curtailing loopholes is unacceptable, and the president shouldn’t accept a cuts-only deal.</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">But failure would not only tarnish Republicans; it would also stain Obama’s legacy. Great presidential leadership entails figuring out how to deal with even those who do not like you. </div>
<p>Indeed it does.  Maybe Marcus has in mind the option of dealing with those in Congress who don’t like him by, say, informing the public that federal spending is now at its lowest level in more than 50 years; that the budget deficit had declined substantially since he took office (after initially rising); that the 2011 and 2012 debt ceiling and fiscal cliff agreements included large reductions in spending; that he and the Dems are now proposing further reductions in spending; and that taxes on the wealthy are at historically low levels dating back to pre-WWII, with the single exception being the decade of the 2000s. And that there actually is no good reason at all to have a balanced federal budget, and it’s just being used as a way to gut the federal budget. And that he could even directly inform the public of what the Ryan budget actually proposes.  
<div></div>
<div>But I doubt it. Marcus&#8217;s op-ed piece, after all, isn’t titled ”Obama has to be dealmaker in chief,” for nothing.</p>
<p>Great presidential leadership entails figuring out how to deal with even those who do not like you. And certainly Obama hasn’t yet figured out how to deal with even those who do not like him. Or how to deal with even those who themselves are in leadership positions and whose very political careers depend now entirely on being the <i>un</i>-Dirksen.  </p>
<p>Those who, say, wouldn’t engage in actual leadership&#8211;as opposed to Leadership&#8211;if Everett Dirksen himself reappeared as a ghost in the Capitol and defined it for them.  And who are buttressed in this <i>every single time some &#8220;name&#8221; pundit claims otherwise.</i>  </p>
<p>The centrist-pundit crowd should not be held harmless in this.  They are not harmless. </p></div>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/03/cathy-oneil-black-scholes-and-the-normal-distribution.html#8DRYALIumDeBb9jL.99">Naked Capitalism</a> comes this post from Cathy O&#8217;Niel, <i>Black Scholes and the normal distribution. </i>form her blog <i><a href="http://mathbabe.org/2013/03/12/black-scholes-and-the-normal-distribution/"> mathbabe.</a> </i>(re-posted with permission from the author).</p>
<p>There have been lots of comments and confusion, <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2013/03/10/modeling-fraud-in-the-financial-system/#comments">especially in this post</a>, over what people in finance do or do not assume about how the markets work. I wanted to dispel some myths (at the risk of creating more).</p>
<p>First, there’s a big difference between quantitative trading and quantitative risk. And there may be a bunch of other categories that also exist, but I’ve only worked in those two arenas.</p>
<p><strong>Markets are not efficient</strong></p>
<p>In quantitative trading, nobody really thinks that “markets are efficient.” That’s kind of ridiculous, since then what would be the point of trying to make money through trading? We essentially make money because they aren’t. But of course that’s not to say they are entirely inefficient. Some approaches to removing inefficiency, and some markets, are easier than others. There can be entire markets that are so old and well-combed-over that the inefficiencies (that people have thought of) have been more or less removed and so, to make money, you have to be more thoughtful. A better way to say this is that the inefficiencies that are left are smaller than the transaction costs that would be required to remove them.</p>
<p>It’s not clear where “removing inefficiency” ends and where a different kind of trading begins, by the way. In some sense all algorithmic trades that work for any amount of time can be thought of as removing inefficiency, but then it becomes a useless concept.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Also, you can see from the above that traders have a vested interest to introduce new kinds of markets to the system, because new markets have new inefficiencies that can be picked off.</p>
<p>This kind of trading is very specific to a certain kind of time horizon as well. Traders and their algorithms typically want to make money in the average year. If there’s an inefficiency with a time horizon of 30 years it may still exist but few people are patient enough for it (I should add that we also probably don’t have good enough evidence that they’d work, considering how quickly the markets change). Indeed the average quant shop is going in the opposite direction, of high speed trading, for that very reason, to find the time horizon at which there are still obvious inefficiencies.</p>
<p><strong>Black-Scholes</strong></p>
<p>A long long time ago, before Black Monday in 1987, people didn’t know how to price options. Then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes">Black-Scholes</a> came out and traders started using the Black-Scholes (BS) formula and it worked pretty well, until Black Monday came along and people suddenly realized the assumptions in BS were ridiculous. Ever since then people have adjusted the BS formula. Everyone.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to think about how to adjust the formula, but a very common one is through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_smile">volatility smile</a>. This allows us to remove the BS assumption of constant volatility (of the underlying stock) and replace it with whatever inferred volatility is actually traded on in the market for that strike price and that maturity. As <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2013/03/10/modeling-fraud-in-the-financial-system/#comment-22262">this commenter mentioned</a>, the BS formula is still used here as a convenient reference to do this calculation. If you extend your consideration to any maturity and any strike price (for the same underlying stock or thingy) then you get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_surface#Implied_volatility_surface">volatility surface</a> by the same reasoning.<br />Two things to mention. First, you can think of the volatility smile/ surface as adjusting the assumption of constant volatility, but you can also ascribe to it an adjustment of the assumption of a normal distribution of the underlying stock. There’s really no way to extricate those two assumptions, but you can convince yourself of this by a thought experiment: if the volatility stays fixed but the presumed shape of the distribution of the stocks gets fatter-tailed, for example, then option prices (for options that are far from the current price) will change, which will in turn change the implied volatility according to the market (i.e. the smile will deepen). In other words, the smile adjusts for more than one assumption.</p>
<p>The other thing to mention: although we’ve done a relatively good job adjusting to market reality when pricing an option, when we apply our current risk measures like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk">Value-at-Risk</a> (VaR) to options, we still assume a normal distribution of risk factors (one of the risk factors, if we were pricing options, would be the implied volatility). So in other words, we might have a pretty good view of current prices, but it’s not at all clear we know how to make reasonable scenarios of future pricing shifts.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this assumption of normal distributions of risk factors in calculating VaR is actually pretty important in terms of our view of systemic risks. We do it out of computational convenience, by the way. That and because when we use fatter-tailed assumptions, people don’t like the answer.</p>

Angry Bear has carried a number of posts on the World Trade Organization intent and structure&#8230;here are several on the particular issue between Antigua and the US.  The issue is not earthshaking in amounts of money, but offers a look at the potential conflicts that can play out between nations.  Perhaps coming later further exploration of the World Trade Organization (from past Angry Bear posts) will be warranted.</p>

<blockquote><p>On Monday the World Trade Organization (WTO) officially <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/business/global/dispute-with-antigua-and-barbuda-threatens-us-copyrights.html?_r=0">authorized</a> Caribbean nation Antigua to sell $21 million in &#8220;pirated&#8221; U.S.-copyrighted music, films and computer programs in retaliation for the United States failing to comply with a <a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/Gamblingsummary2007.pdf">2005 WTO order</a> to allow online gambling here. Say what? (And, no, this news was not sourced from a parody in <em>The Onion</em>.)</p>
<p>The case is an illustrated guide to much of <a href="http://www.citizen.org/Page.aspx?pid=758">what is wrong with the WTO</a>. And, it should spotlight the lunacy of Obama administration plans to expand this dangerous &#8220;trade&#8221; agreement model via the <a href="http://www.citizen.org/TPP">Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) &#8220;free trade&#8221;</a> agreement. More on that later. Let&#8217;s tour what is now a full coop of WTO chickens that have come home to roost on this WTO case.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>First, the backstory: in 2003, Antigua filed a case at the WTO claiming that U.S. laws banning Internet gambling violated WTO rules. The case, which some say was in fact the brainchild of an American attorney, Mark Mandel, who is handling the WTO litigation for Antigua, was joined by the European Union and other countries with major gambling industries. Antigua won a final ruling in 2005 and yesterday&#8217;s &#8220;sanctions&#8221; announcement was retaliation for the United States failing to change its domestic laws to comply with the WTO.</p>
<p>Why does the WTO have <em>anything</em> to say as to whether or not the U.S. Congress can ban Internet gambling, especially when the ban applies to domestic and foreign firms alike? Unlike past <u>trade</u> agreements, which focused on cutting tariffs, the WTO imposes expansive constraints on signatory governments&#8217; <u>non-trade</u> policies and establishes new corporate rights. The WTO&#8217;s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) limits how the U.S. government may regulate foreign service firms operating here and cross-border &#8220;trade&#8221; in services too. The WTO&#8217;s Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement requires countries to provide expanded monopoly patent and copyright terms. (That&#8217;s how U.S. drug patent monopolies got expanded from 17 to 20 years in 1994 when Congress OK&#8217;d U.S. WTO accession, overruling decades of congressional opposition to such patent extensions and costing us billions in higher drug prices, pocketed by WTO booster Big PhRMA.)</p></blockquote>

<div dir="ltr">All of these bipartisan discussions are encouraging, and Republicans hope they will lead to real solutions that help American families. But presidential leadership is really what’s needed. By shifting the focus from charm to courage, and eventually action, we can guarantee our children a future where everyone has the opportunity to find work and pursue their piece of the American dream. That would be the grandest bargain of all.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/john-boehner-obamas-intraparty-problem/2013/03/13/455e097e-8c19-11e2-b63f-f53fb9f2fcb4_story.html">Obama’s outreach is nice, but where’s the leadership?</a>, John Boehner, Op-ed, Washington Post, today</div>
<p>I have what I think is a better question, this one for the speaker: Where’s a dictionary?</p>
<p>One of the most pernicious aspects of these phony, sequential fiscal crises is, in my opinion, the Republicans’ tactic of selecting single words or short phrases that have an appealing meaning and using them to mean something else entirely&#8211;often something the opposite of what the word or phrase actually means.  It’s so clearly concerted, political-consultant-suggested, Madison Avenue-type sales gimmickry; every few days there’s a new messaging word or short phrase, redefined or otherwise-misleadingly used, and then repeated, repeated, repeated … repeated.   </p>
<p>Enter “leadership.”  And now, “courage.”  As in: the president should demonstrate these qualities by delegating to the Tea Party the fiscal policy of the United States, because the Tea Party is now the Republican Party and it wants to disassemble the federal government <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/03/14/the-morning-plum-wheres-the-leadership-john-boehner/">and will settle for nothing less</a>.* </p>
<p>So I suggest that Obama offer Boehner a dictionary and ask him to point to where it defines leadership as abdication, and courage as cowering.  Whether you’re the president or, say, the Speaker of the House.  </p>
<p>Maybe more to the point, where in the dictionary definition of either leadership or courage does it define those words as including doing absolutely whatever is necessary to keep your position as House speaker, regardless of the consequences to the country you took an oath of office to serve?  Neither the Merriam-Webster’s nor the Oxford English limits those terms to references to the president of the United States.  The definitions do look broad enough to include the speaker.  And even the Senate minority leader.  Even ones who are petrified (literally, it appears from the look on his face these days) of being “primaried” by a Tea Party candidate.  </p>
<p>The Orwellian redefinition of words to mean the opposite of, or at least something entirely different than, their actual meaning is a standard propaganda and subterfuge tool of dictatorships. Mao Tse-tung was infamous for this.  And so, of course, was Hitler.  (The inscription in German, “Work will make you free,” remains above the front gate of Auschwitz in Oswiecim, Poland, a permanent reminder of the deeply sinister nature of extreme semantics games employed in the service of political propaganda.) </p>
<p>That so much of the proud-centrist punditry and fair-and-balanced mainstream media have assisted Boehner &#038; Friends in their sophistry in the last month is inexcusable, if no longer surprising.  If they agree with Boehner that the Ryan budget will guarantee our children a future where everyone has the opportunity to find work and pursue their piece of the American dream, then they should explain why.  If they believe instead that the Ryan budget will guarantee our children a future in which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">Atlas really </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">has</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand"> shrugged and everyone lives inside The Fountainhead</a> (or maybe in the Pakistan of North America), then they should say that, and explain why. At least the news analysis writers and the centrist pundits should. </p>
<p>They won’t.  But maybe a few of them will point out that, with due respect to Mr. Boehner, the grandest bargain of all would be a free Webster’s Collegiate delivered to the Speaker’s office on Capitol Hill. </p>
<p>As for Obama, he got lucky in the last two days.  The Ryan budget will disabuse a clear majority of the next poll responders that the GOP should be trusted with determining what cuts to make to the federal budget, and when.  At least if the public actually learns the specifics.  (That, of course, would have been true for the last few years, had Obama deigned to apprise the public of the specifics.)  And the live &#8220;tweets&#8221; from the Republican House-member attendees during their meeting with him yesterday were so vile that Obama really needs now only to recite a few of them in order to fully open the public&#8217;s eyes, if and when he decides to speak to the public about the actual situation.  </p>
<p>And, who knows?  Maybe he will, now that he&#8217;s checked off the extend-an-olive-branch box on the mainstream press&#8217;s list of what Leaders (if not necessarily Courageous ones) do, and therefore may even have their permission to do so.</p>

<div></div>
<div>Via <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/14/1193955/--Senator-Sherrod-Brown-Drops-a-Bombshell-in-Mary-Jo-White-s-Hearing-by-Pam-Martens" target="_blank">Bob Swern </a>at Daily Kos who linked to a post by<a href="http://wallstreetonparade.com/2013/03/senator-sherrod-brown-drops-a-bombshell-in-mary-jo-whites-hearing/" target="_blank"> Pam Martens </a>at Wall Street on Parade comes a bit of transcript from the confirmation hearing for Mary Jo White for the SEC. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Senator Brown: When you were U.S. Attorney, my understanding is you consulted Bob Rubin and Larry Summers when considering whether to bring charges against financial firms. Is that correct?</div>
<div>  </div>
<div></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>White: I actually consulted the Deputy Attorney General who had Mr. Summers call me back. I was asking a factual question.</div>
<div>  </div>
<div></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>Senator Brown: Did they reject the argument that institutions could not be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law?</div>
<div>  </div>
<div></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>White: I’d like to answer that yes or no but I can’t. Essentially, I was seeking information based on an argument that had been made by the lawyers for the institution that I ultimately indicted, as to whether an indictment of that institution would result in great damage to either the Japanese economy or the world economy. And the answer I got back is that I should proceed to make my own decision; which I took to mean that it would likely not have that impact.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Pam then notes:</div>
<blockquote><div>There actually is an official policy but its finer points have certainly not been expanded upon by either Attorney General Holder or SEC nominee Mary Jo White.  The policy is called Title 9, Chapter 9-28.000: Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations.*  The policy thoroughly advocates the prosecution of corporations — especially when there is a serial history of fraud as in the case of Wall Street.  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>She quotes from the policy:</div>
<blockquote><div>“…Virtually every conviction of a corporation, like virtually every conviction of an individual, will have an impact on innocent third parties, and the mere existence of such an effect is not sufficient to preclude prosecution of the corporation.”</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Just saying.</div>
<div></div>
<div>*The link for the actual policy is in Pam&#8217;s article.</div>

<p>I have made the point many times that if anything stops Obamacare it will be the inability to implement an extremely complicated program. Call it “Rusty’s Theory of Complexity.”</p>
<p>The feds have now published (link below) the draft application for financial assistance in health care exchanges and low income plans. Oh boy.</p>
<p>With attachments this could easily run 30 + pages, and of course someone is going to have to process this (there will be an online version). Having helped people with paperwork for nearly 40 years I can guarantee this will be intimidating and confusing to many people.</p>
<p>Complication is the enemy of implementation. Count on it.<br /><a href="http://cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/PaperworkReductionActof1995/PRA-Listing-Items/CMS-10440.html">     </a><br /><a href="http://cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/PaperworkReductionActof1995/PRA-Listing-Items/CMS-10440.html">http://cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/PaperworkReductionActof1995/PRA-Listing-Items/CMS-10440.html</a></p>

                                <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amity_Shlaes">Amity Shlaes</a>, the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2009/04/23/how-denialism-works/">disinformation bunny</a>, is still going.  In the latest issue of <i>Imprimus</i>, a publication of <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu//">Hillsdale College</a>, is a transcript adapted from a recent talk she gave there during a conference on the Income Tax, sponsored by Hillsdale&#8217;s own <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu/seminars/oncampus/cca/default.asp">Center for Constructive Alternatives</a> and the <a href="http://mises.org/media/categories/160/Lecture-Series">Ludwig von Mises Lecture Series</a>.  Right away, you know this is going to be good.  The Title of her contribution is <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu/news/imprimis.asp"><u>Calvin Coolidge and the Moral Case for Economy</u></a>.  Of course, by economy, she means austerity.</p>
<p>There is so much wrong here it&#8217;s both impressive and depressing.  Rather than give her the full<a href="http://www.ginandtacos.com/index.php?s=fjm"> FJM treatment</a>,  which would take more time and energy than she deserves, I&#8217;ll just hit  on a couple of the lowlights.  Here is her opening paragraph.</p>
<blockquote><p>With  the Federal debt spiraling out of control, many Americans sense an  urgent need to find a political leader who is able to say &#8220;no&#8221; to  spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we go. Her first sentence is an exercise in made-up right-wing talking point mythology.  I&#8217;ve already exploded the &#8216;<i>Obama is a profligate spender</i>&#8221; myth, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/a-quick-look-at-federal-spending.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/why-spendinggdp-is-terrible-horrible-no.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/yes-right-wing-lies-when-they-say-obama.html">here</a>. Further, we have just lived through three years when federal spending was close to flat line, as Graph 1 shows.   </p>
<p>

<div> Graph 1 &#8211; Flat Federal Spending Under Obama  </div>
<p>There   is only one comparable period in post WW II history, 1953-56, during  Eisenhower&#8217;s first term, as shown in Graph 2.   Still, over Ike&#8217;s full  term, spending grew by about 30%.</p>
<p>

<div> Graph 2  Not So Flat Spending Growth Under Eisenhower (&#8217;53-&#8217;60)</div>
<p>To  suggest that federal dept is now  &#8220;spiraling out of control&#8221; due to excessive spending is not merely  disingenuous.  It is a sign that either Shlaes has no earthly idea what  she&#8217;s talking about, which in an alleged journalist, is unforgivable, or  it&#8217;s a bare-faced lie, which is unforgivable for anybody.  And if many  Americans are feeling the urgent need to curtail government spending, it&#8217;s because  they have been lied to so repeatedly and often that <a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/02/22/17056939-a-well-kept-fiscal-secret?lite">they have no idea what the truth is</a>.  As <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/attack-of-the-trust-fund-zombie/?gwh=AB363FEF15056F07526B7216D6409BAD">Krugman recently put it</a>: &#8220;<i>And I have to say, it’s extremely telling that conservative Republicans  don’t seem able to make their case without resorting, right from the  beginning, to obviously dumb fallacies</i>.&#8221;  The truth is that if we have a debt problem, it is due to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/another-look-at-spending-and-revenues.html">a shortfall in revenues</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet they fear that finding such a leader is impossible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its  not clear who made Shlaes the spokesperson for this sorry,  disenfranchised segment of the population, nor that this is indeed what  they fear.  Perhaps we should introduce Shlaes and the rest of these  Real Americans to the <i>real</i> President B. Hoover Obama.</p>
<blockquote><p>Conservatives long for another Ronald Reagan.</p></blockquote>
<p>This  is probably correct, though as Shlaes goes on to demonstrate,  conservatives in this way &#8211; and, alas, right-wingers almost always &#8211; are rather badly  disconnected from reality.</p>
<blockquote><p>He  was of course a tax cutter, reducing the top marginal rate from 70 to  28 percent.  But his tax cuts &#8211; which vindicated supply side economics  by vastly increasing federal revenue &#8211; were bought partly through a  bargain with Democrats who were eager to spend that revenue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wrong again.  The reality is that <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2010/02/taxes-and-revenues.html">Revenue growth under Reagan was the worst</a> of any 20th century President, post Eisenhower, except for the  unfortunate Bush, Sr. under who&#8217;s recession plagued regime Reagan&#8217;s buzzards came home to  roost. And was it really the Democrats who spent that anemic revenue  stream, or did it go to Reagan&#8217;s Star Wars fantasy?</p>
<blockquote><p>Reagan was no budget cutter.  In fact, the federal budget grew over a third during his administration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here, she finally gets something right, if by &#8220;federal budget&#8221; she means Total Outlays, and by &#8220;over a third&#8221; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals">she means over 80%</a>  [as measured from 1980 to 1988.]</p>
<p>Things get really egregious further on in the section titled &#8220;<i>The Purpose of Tax Cuts.</i>&#8221;   She informs us that President Coolidge and Treasury Secretary Andrew  Mellon campaigned to lower top rates from the 50&#8217;s to the 20&#8217;s.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mellon  and Coolidge did not win all they sought.  The top rate of the final  law was in the forties.  But even this reduction yielded results &#8211; more  money flowing into the treasury &#8211; suggesting that &#8220;scientific taxation&#8221;  worked.  By 1926, Coolidge was able to sign legislation that brought the  top marginal rate down to 25%, and do so retroactively.</p></blockquote>
<p>I  was surprised to learn that Coolidge and Mellon had anticipated the  Laffer curve by 6 decades.  Let&#8217;s have a look at how more money flowed  into the treasury. In 1922 and &#8217;23, with a <a href="http://www.ntu.org/tax-basics/history-of-federal-individual-1.html">top marginal rate of 56%</a>, <a href="http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/revenue_chart_1915_1930USb_13s1li011mcn_10f30f40f50f60f_Federal_Revenue_By_Type#copypaste">tax revenues were $2.23 and 1.69 billion respectively</a>.  [Per FRED, 1923 was a recession year]  In 1924, with a top rate of 46%,  total revenues were $1.79 billion.  This is what Shleas calls &#8220;more  money flowing into the treasury.&#8221;  Here&#8217;s a bigger picture look.  In 1920, when <a href="http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/course/Labortaxes/taxableincome/taxableincome_attach.pdf">the top marginal rate was 73%</a>,  receipts were slightly over $4 billion.  In 1925, when the top marginal  rate  was 25%, receipts were $1.7 billion, less than half of the 1920 value,  and by 1929 had only increased to 2.23 billion.  Graph 3 shows revenues  per year [Coolidge&#8217;s term highlighted in red,] and belies Shlaes&#8217;  assertion.</p>

<p>A  best fit straight line is included.  There&#8217;s lots of scatter, for a  variety of reasons, but the upward trend &#8211; the exact opposite of Shleas&#8217;  assertion, is obvious.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the reality.  A  decade of tax cutting and deregulation led  us into the Great Depression, the worst economic collapse of the 20th  century. [You might note that the following decades of high tax rates  and robust regulation were free of these horrible events.]  And what  happened most recently?  A decade of tax cuts and deregulation &#8211; the end  game of three decades of this supply-side approach &#8211; led to the  greatest economic collapse since the Great Depression.  Significantly,  the major deregulations of big finance, including the repeal of  Glass-Steagall came at the end of Clinton&#8217;s  term, less than a decade prior to the financial melt down.  Last Friday  on his radio show, Thom Hartmann pointed out that prior to the  regulations put in place in the 30&#8217;s, the U.S. had never gone for more  than 15 years without a major financial collapse.  So this result should  have been expected.</p>
<p>The  extraordinary thing isn&#8217;t that right wingers lie.  The simple reality  is that they can&#8217;t make their case without lying, because it has no  merit.  The extraordinary thing is that their lies are so easily rooted  out and refuted, in the era of free and easily accessible information,  but so few people will take the required few minutes to go ahead and do  it. Sadly, whenever the truth comes up against a cascade of lies, <a href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/2009/04/06/climate-change-and-argumentative-fallacies/">the liars have a significant tactical advantage</a>.  </p>
<p>Shlaes&#8217; presentation is just one more  manifestation of the right wing ploy of denying reality.   Sadly, it  works, because you really can fool a lot of the people a lot of the  time.</p>

<p>Addressing TBTF with tax and other policy: because &#8220;Big Banks Go Wrong, Pay Little Price&#8221;</p>
<p>The New York Times today reiterated what many Americans lament&#8211;Big Banks went uncharged for serving as the main engine of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession">Great Recession</a> that cost ordinary Americans jobs, homes and futures.  See Andrew Ross Sorkin, <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/big-banks-go-wrong-but-pay-a-little-price/">Big Banks Go Wrong, but Pay a Little Price</a>, New York Times, at B1 (March 12, 2013).</p>
<p>Big Banks (and especially their managers), however, made out like bandits through the socialisation of losses and privatisation of gains.  The aftermath of the crisis provided  lower cost of funds from the perceived government <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail">TBTF</a> subsidy.  Big Bank managers made big bucks leading their institutions into disaster and &#8220;staying on&#8221; after the disaster because their &#8220;expertise&#8221; was essential.  The stock market, but not ordinary Americans&#8217; pocketbooks or paychecks,  has recovered from the recession, forging a return of lucrative M&#038;A activity and, of course, the management of wealthy people&#8217;s assets.  No Big Bank has faced criminal indictment for &#8220;the damage caused to the economy and millions of Americans&#8221; by their  sloppy mortgage financing, sloppy foreclosure procedures, and casino capitalism &#8220;bets&#8221; with credit default swaps and other derivatives.</p>
<p>The reason&#8211;the lesson from <a href="http://www.enron.com/">Enron</a> and <a href="http://andersen.com/">Arthur Andersen</a>, where thousands of lower-level employees who had no control over corporate actions lost their jobs when the firms collapsed after wrongdoing and charges.  Any Big Corp can be TBTF.  &#8220;[S]imply charging a company with a crime reaises the possibility of putting the firm out of business.&#8221;  Id. at B5.  Collateral damage is therefore a major hurdle to bringing a criminal case against a corporation.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The takeaway, according to the Times article, is that &#8220;prosecutors should focus on the individuals responsible for the misconduct&#8221; rather than indict corporations, which can result in &#8220;condemnation of one person [many employees] for the actions of another [boards and managers or &#8216;rogue&#8217; employees]&#8221; (quoting, in the latter case, Elizabeth Ainslie&#8217;s paper on indicting corporatrions).</p>
<p>While protecting employees of rogue firms (where management and directors have pursued aggrandisement of their own status and riches at the cost of society&#8217;s well-being) is important, it is not clear that the takeway outlined above is a complete answer.  Several additional components should be addressed, by a combination of Congressional and state legislative action and regulating agencies.  And actions to limit the size of corporations would have another advantage&#8211;acting as a deterrent to their power in dictating the well-being of ordinary employees, and thus helping to deflect the growth of corporatism in our society.</p>
<ul>
<li>First,  boards that make irresponsible judgements that allow CEOs and managers to engage in reckless bets with their companies should be able to be held personally responsible more easily, without corporate protection for the ultimate costs.  </li>
<li>Second, anti-trust needs to be expanded to limit the interwoven boards and contractual relationships that permit a few TBTF institutions in an industry to dominate the market and set the &#8220;Wall Street Rule&#8221; for what is acceptable behavior.  ULtimately we need forced split-up of TBTF institutions, through anti-trust or new means, as necessary. </li>
<li>Third (and most relevant for this blog, of course), tax policies encouraging corporate consolidation should be strictly limited.  The section 368 reorganization provisions should be tightened to require a much higher percentage of continued shareholder interest: the current requirement for a tax free reorg of only 40% (under an example in the reorg regulations) should be tighted to at least 70%.  The opportunities for loss recognition in reorgs provided by the Bush Treasury under regulations should be eliminated.  Spins of parts of mega corporations to existing shareholders should remain tax-free, but spins that amount to initial steps in acquisitions should be more limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will Congress (or state legislators) take any of these actions?  It is highly dubious.  The left is too often too cowardly to act and mostly funded by wealthy interests.  Most on the right&#8211;disproportionately represented in Congress because of gerrymandering in the House and the disproportionate Senator-to-population ratios in the Senate&#8211;dogmatically favor market fundamentalism no matter the evil it causes when it comes to advantages for business to make more profits, even if it comes at the expense of ordinary people through market power to defeat unions, defeat reasonable pay requests, etc.  (Of course, when it comes to exploiting government , the right tends to favor government subsidies&#8211;look at Wisconsin&#8217;s recent move to remove pesky environmental regulations protecting wetlands to support a mine owner, in the purported interest in supporting job creation, even when the mine is likely to cause long-term environmental damage and potentially devastating water pollution and destruction of wetlands.)</p>

                                <p>In support of Beverly&#8217;s <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/03/douglas-holtz-eakin-balancing-budget-is.html" target="_blank">latest post</a> and all her past postings wanting for Obama (or the Dem&#8217;s in general I would say) to explain the truth about how a government&#8217;s money really flows, I present this video from the Watson Institute. (via Didby at Hullaaloo.)  I happen to agree, it would be nice if our president would get it straight, but&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/15061570">The Watson Institute presents Mark Blyth on Austerity</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/globalconv">The Global Conversation</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p> Of course, my pet peeve is that no one is talking about our nation&#8217;s equity.  I am confident that the American family would get that part of financing as it relates to borrowing and investing.  Heck, how long was it before Amazon broke even yet they kept right on borrowing and growing?*  Or lets put it closer to home.  How many Americans purchased a home that was valued at and borrowed against for the purchase that was equal to their annual income?  What was the old rule&#8230;3 times the median income was the average home price?</p>
