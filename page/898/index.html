                                <p>Pseudo-expert on everything decides that the <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDA0YzI0YzBlYTc1YmFmMTM3N2QxMDExZWIwYTE0M2E=">Minimum Wage Minimizes Jobs</a> by doing extensive empirical work, while watching checking out <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,251578,00.html">Faux News</a>.  Yes, Brit Hume finds some anecdotal evidence in Arizona but then gets serious by checking out a Federal Reserve study. Actually, the Faux News link pulls up 2470 references to the Federal Reserve and Brit forgot to tell us which one.  But he did provide this:</p>
<blockquote><p>for every ten percent increase in the minimum wage &#8211; there is a corresponding two to three percent decrease in employment.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know that AB readers get the point but let’s say this really slowly so Jonah might be able to follow.  What this line means is that the labor demand curve is INELASTIC.  So with an elasticity of demand of only 0.2, labor income actually goes up by 8% if the wage increase is increased by 10%.  I do hope Jonah got this simple point finally – as I would hate to have to go over this ad nausam during office hours.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I often enjoy reading what Robert Reich has to say, but <a href="http://robertreich.blogspot.com/2007/02/why-balancing-budget-is-stupid-idea.html">this piece</a> just made me sad:<br />
<blockquote>The federal budget is just an accounting convention – and a lousy one at that. It doesn’t distinguish between three types of spending: (1) spending that&#8217;s necessary to pay off obligations made in the past, (2) spending intended to make us better off today, and (3) spending to make us more productive in the future. Any family knows the difference between past, present, and future – between, say, paying down the mortgage, going on an ocean cruise, or paying college tuition for the kids &#8230; But the federal budget doesn’t at all resemble a family budget. The federal budget is a static account that tells us nothing about past, present, or future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The family budget is also a static concept – and most households look at savings and investment decisions in terms of their long-term impact.  In this sense, the federal budget is like the family budget.  I’m sure Robert has heard of the Ando-Modigliani life-cycle model.  So the real point is whether we are running deficits to invest in our future.  The sad truth is that Bush’s fiscal fiasco has not only caused some to panic that we’ve spent the Social Security reserves but it has also likely reduced investment.  </p>
<p>Robert makes a few good point here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Price supports designed to protect today’s farmers are treated the same way as education and health care for our nation’s children. They both show up as categories in the yearly budget – even though the farm price supports are to keep a group of people secure today, while education and child health care are really investments in America’s future. Social Security surpluses show up in the budget as this year’s revenues that offset this year’s expenses. But in reality the surpluses are payments by post-war boomers who are still working – but who in a few years will be retired and making big withdrawals. What look like revenues will soon turn into big liabilities. The federal budget hides this inconvenient fact.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, the unified deficit understates the general fund deficit precisely because it counts the Trust Fund surpluses as offsets.  So we really should be running unified surpluses.  His other points are that not all government spending is the same.  While that’s true, we still have to honor the long-run budget constraint – just like most families do.</p>

                                <p>His logic with respect to the alleged Iranian government culpability for Iranian munitions is noted <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/002576.php">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll resist the temptation to draw an organizational chart, for obvious reasons. They&#8217;re part of the Iranian defense and intelligence establishment. They&#8217;re a major part of the Iranian government. Therefore, the actions of that force are the responsibility of that government. If that force is supplying technology for Shiite militants, that government is responsible.</p></blockquote>
<p>The military police and the CIA officers at the Abu Ghraib prison were part of the American defense and intelligence establishment.  Do we need to draw an organizational chart for the Undersecretary?  Just how desperate is President Bush to launch us into another war that will make us less safe?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Yesterday I had a post looking at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively.html">changes in real GDP per capita over Presidential administrations</a> beginning with Ike.  However, real GDP per capita can be boosted by Federal spending, and in any given year, Federal spending can be paid for by debt.  Because, as PGL and others keep reminding us, increasing the debt is merely a way to postpone taxes (preferably into someone else’s administration), it makes sense to look at the growth per capita in the real GDP less the change in the real debt.</p>
<p>Data for the total debt held by the public <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo4.htm">from from 1950 to 2005</a> can be obtained from the Treasury; this data set provides data from 1953 to 1985 for December 31st of each year, and for 1985 to 2005 for September 30th of each year.  Data for September 2006 was also obtained <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/NPGateway">from the Treasury</a>.   </p>
<p>As in yesterday’s post, real GDP per capita came from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SS_Data/Section7All_xls.xls">BEA’s NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  However, to match the debt series, this time I used Q4 data through 1985, and Q3 data thereafter.</p>
<p>Table 1 below shows the annualized percentage change in real GDP less debt per capita.  It also shows the results for the best and worst years or the administration, and the average of the annual growth rates when the best and worst years are left out.  Growth rates are calculated using the last year before the administration took office to the last full year for which the administration was in office.</p>
<p>Table 1<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdM7KoVHjgI/AAAAAAAAAB0/pqbqidBc15I/s1600-h/God+Punishes,+part+2,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdM7KoVHjgI/AAAAAAAAAB0/pqbqidBc15I/s320/God+Punishes,+part+2,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Table 2 is similar to Table 1, but it assumes an administration may have little control over results for its first year.  Thus, growth rates are calculated using the first year in which the administration is in office to its last full year in office.</p>
<p>Table 2<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdM7PIVHjhI/AAAAAAAAAB8/iyJhI810pZw/s1600-h/God+Punishes,+part+2,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdM7PIVHjhI/AAAAAAAAAB8/iyJhI810pZw/s320/God+Punishes,+part+2,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Whether we look at things Table 1’s way, or Table 2’s, the 3 best performing administrations were the 3 Democratic administrations.  If I remember my probability theory, if you have an urn with 8 balls that differ only by color, where are 3 black balls and 5 are white balls, the odds of randomly selecting all 3 that are white when 3 of them are removed from the urn are (3/8) * (2/7) * (1/6) or 1.8%.  </p>
<p>Put another way, Democratic administrations produce better growth than Republican administrations.  Either its because Democratic administrations have tended to behave more rationally, or its because God really, really doesn’t like it when we vote for Republican Presidents.  Take your pick.</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Note… in the comments to yesterday’s post, it was noted that Congress has a lot to do with this.  I hope to have a follow up using Congressional data some time soon.</p>

                                <p>Our friend <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2007/02/#000786">Bill Polley</a> discovers some leftwing stupidity on this topic as reported <a href="http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/W/WISCONSIN_GAS_TAX?SITE=WIRE&#038;SECTION=HOME&#038;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">here</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Gov. Jim Doyle proposes taxing big oil companies more than $270 million over the next two years to help pay for the state&#8217;s transportation needs. Doyle said the assessment will equate to $1.50 per barrel of oil sold in the state, and the companies would be prohibited from passing the tax on to customers at the pump. Violations carry a criminal penalty of up to six months in prison.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we did levy a tax on the actual barrel of oil, the incidence of this tax will be jointly borne by consumers and suppliers with the division depending on the relative elasticities of demand and supply.  I guess the Governor could make like <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/rightwinger-praises-jimmy-carters-oil.html">President Carter</a> and impose price controls, which would likely lead to shortages.  </p>
<p>But what about a profits tax?  Bill writes:<br />
<blockquote>Windfall profits taxes are not good policy. They severely distort incentives and change the firms&#8217; attitude toward risk. The capricious nature with which these taxes could be imposed, removed, or changed just adds to the distortion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Time to turn the microphone over to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/02/did_jimmy_carters_oil_windfall.html#015474">Dean Baker</a>:<br />
<blockquote>While there is probably never a pure rent (meaning someone gets paid more than necessary to get them to provide a good or service), rents are generally a good place to look for revenue. The distortions from a well-designed windfall profits tax  are almost certainly lower than the distortions from income or sales taxes. If we can substitute a windfall profits tax for more distortionary taxes, we are almost certainly coming out ahead.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The U.S. federal budget surplus widened by 82% in January to $38.2 billion from $21 billion a year earlier, the Treasury Department reported Monday.  The surplus is slightly below the Congressional Budget Office estimate of about $40 billion. January usually as a surplus month because many individuals must make estimated tax payments, analysts said.</p></blockquote>
<p>So we typically have January cash inflows and this one fell below expectations.  Hat tip to <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/lying_in_politics_/2007/02/more_fiscal_hokum_from_the_right.php">Mark Kleiman</a> who is having a grand old time with the rightwing’s inability to understand even basic concepts like reading.  Mark is even offering bets up to <a href="http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2007/01/when_will_the_b.html">The Skeptical Optimist</a>.  You would think an optimist would unconditionally take such a bet – assuming he really believes that the Federal government is about to run a surplus.</p>

                                <p><a href="https://registration.ft.com/registration/barrier?referer=http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/&#038;location=http%3A//www.ft.com/cms/s/0d0fb912-bad5-11db-bbf3-0000779e2340.html">Raghuram Rajan</a> joins the insufficiency of investment demand club:<br />
<blockquote>Signs of extremely benign financing conditions are plentiful, ranging from low long-term interest rates to historically narrow credit spreads on risky assets. Many observers call this a liquidity glut, thereby implicating central banks and their accommodative policies. But in my view, these conditions may primarily be driven by a global shortage of hard assets.  My argument relies on two global ingredients. The first is that, in spite of substantial worldwide income growth, if anything there has been an increase in the desire to save out of it. In emerging markets where income growth is rapid, savings increase. Household consumption in developing countries takes time to catch up with higher incomes – either because households take time to be confident that the increase is permanent or because credit constraints prevent them from borrowing to consume against future incomes.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/the_global_shor.html">Mark Thoma</a> wonders what I might say:<br />
<blockquote>He might also note that while low investment demand is usually explained by factors such as the Asian crisis, the collapse of the dot-com bubble, and 9/11, all of which diminished businesses&#8217; willingness to undertake risky investments, this adds additional factors associated with &#8220;global ingredients&#8221; such as competition from emerging markets. With the additional uncertainty these factors add, it &#8220;makes less and less sense for corporations in industrial countries to make large domestic investments in the manufacturing sector.&#8221; However, if it were just a decline in real investment, we would see low interest rates but also low output (casting this in IS-LM language, think of the IS curve shifting in). However, if there is also a large supply of liquidity, then interest rates would be even lower but output would not necessarily decline, a result consistent with the robust global output we have seen in recent years (think of the IS curve shifting in and the LM curve shifting out). It is also consistent with the low rates of inflation we have seen globally since the low investment demand will offset price pressure from the increased liquidity.</p></blockquote>
<p>That about covers it.  I will say that back in 2001 that I was very critical of Bush’s fiscal stimulus as I thought the expansionary monetary policy itself would take care of any recessionary tendencies from the inward shift of investment demand.  Over time, I began to change my mind as the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates below 1% and the recovery was still anemic.  The good news, however, is that the investment slump has started turning itself around and our economy is getting back towards full employment.  The bad news is that Bush’s fiscal stimulus has not turned around – which has led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.  So the crowding-out effect I worried about then is something that we should worry about now.  Of course we could pray for a miracle and hope that this White House does decide to do something novel during its term in office – get serious about fiscal responsibility.</p>

                                <p>Let me start with the usual dipshit analysis from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODliMjBjZWZjYjRiNzU2MzZkNzhjZDNhOWVhZDE3NTY=">Byron York</a>:<br />
<blockquote>What do Bob Woodward, Robert Novak, Walter Pincus, David Sanger, Glenn Kessler, and Evan Thomas have in common? &#8230; each heard nothing from Libby about Valerie Plame Wilson.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah Byron – that’s why the defense called them as witnesses.  DUH!  Now, let’s talk about Ari Fleischer and Judy Miller.  What do they have in common besides being witnesses for the prosecution?  Oh yea, Scooter told them about Valerie Plame Wilson.  Of course, that’s not the real reason that this is dipshit analysis.  Let’s turn the microphone over to <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_02/010740.php">Kevin Drum</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Who cares? Libby&#8217;s not on trial for outing Plame&#8217;s identity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks Kevin, but let him keep talking as he has something more fundamental to ask:<br />
<blockquote>So here&#8217;s a more pointed question. As near as I can tell, everyone else that prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald talked to during the course of his investigation told him the truth. That includes Richard Armitage, who originally leaked Plame&#8217;s name to Robert Novak. It also appears to include Karl Rove (though only barely), Bob Woodward, Ari Fleischer, Novak himself, and dozens of others. So here&#8217;s my question: If everyone else told the truth, why did Libby lie? Repeatedly. Under oath. What was different about the vice president&#8217;s office that out of the entire mountain of people Fitzgerald interviewed, Dick Cheney&#8217;s chief of staff was the only one who felt he had to lie?</p></blockquote>
<p>You know – Byron York’s incessant manure sometimes pays dividends.  It gets reasonable people like Kevin Drum probing even deeper into the mess known as PlameGate.  The National Review apologists for the liars in the White House want us to believe this is no more than lying about adultery – or something like that (except adultery seems to be an impeachable offense).  No, no, no, no – the REASON Libby perjured himself was to protect Dick Cheney.  One has to wonder – from what?</p>

                                <p>Well, it was the intent of <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/capitalcommerce/070212/windfall_profits_tax_some_mode.htm">James Pethokoukis</a> to do the usual Carter bashing as he tried to trash something Senator Clinton said:<br />
<blockquote>How about a windfall profits tax on Google? It&#8217;s an idea that came to me after watching a video of Sen. Hillary Clinton, speaking at the Democratic National Committee&#8217;s winter wing-ding, apparently call for the confiscation of oil company profits. As the front-runner for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination put it: “The other day the oil companies reported the highest profits in the history of the world. I want to take those profits, and I want to put them into a strategic energy fund that will begin to fund alternative smart energy &#8230; technologies that will begin to actually move us toward the direction of independence.” Why stop there? Why not confiscate a portion of Google&#8217;s fat annual profits–the company&#8217;s 2006 earnings were some $3 billion on revenue of $10.6 billion &#8211; and use it for some relevant national goal? &#8230; The thing, though, is that these targeted taxes don&#8217;t have a great track record. Look at what happened when oil companies were hit with the windfall profit tax that President Carter signed into law in 1980. According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, as recently unearthed by the Tax Foundation, the windfall profits tax–a real bear to administer–had two nasty side effects: 1) It didn&#8217;t raise as much money as forecast. Instead of raising $320 billion between 1980 and 1989, it raised only about $40 billion; 2) the CRS determined that the windfall profits tax had the effect of decreasing domestic production by 3 to 6 percent. So the United States had to import more oil than it otherwise would have.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Tax Foundation document can be found <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1168.html">here</a>.  But let’s review both of these claims.  First, the shortfall in revenues was not due to a decline in production but due to a decline in prices.  Does Mr. Pethokoukis and the Tax Foundation think inward shifts of the supply side lower prices?  Or do they realize that OPEC raised its production during the 1980’s?  But let’s accept the second premise and turn the microphone over to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/02/did_jimmy_carters_oil_windfall.html#015474">Dean Baker</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Well, if U.S. production was reduced by 3 to 6 percent for 5 years, this would have lowered total output by between 500 million and 1 billion barrels over this period. (This assumes annual domestic production of about 3.3 billion barrels a year.) Of course, if we didn&#8217;t pump the oil out of the ground back in the late 70s and early 80s, that means it is still in the ground available for future use. That sounds good to me. The other major indictment of the tax was that it raised much less revenue than had been projected. The key to this part of the story was that oil prices collapsed in 1982. I&#8217;m not sure that anyone wants to attribute this collapse to the windfall profit tax (higher prices means reduced demand), but if that&#8217;s the claim, I&#8217;m not sure that many people would have been upset with the outcome.</p></blockquote>
<p>Crticizing President Carter for his price controls is one thing, but when this crowd bashes his profits tax using these stale arguments, they show they know nothing about either the facts or basic economics.</p>

I would remind the reader that I don&#8217;t necesarilly agree with readers when I post their write-ups; I will post material that I think is well written and reasonably well thought out, especially if I think it will spur discussion or make people think.  I am also happy to post material on topics that I don&#8217;t know much about &#8211; the workings of the WTO and global warming certainly qualify.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here&#8217;s Stormy:<br />____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p> IPCC Report and the WTO</p>
<p>It is time for the WTO and economists, to take seriously the issues of global warming, environmental decay, and the depletion of resources.  Most of us by now are familiar with the conservative IPCC report and its dire predictions for the coming centuries.  Even <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/06/news/FIN-GEN-Egypt-Volcker-Global-Warming.php">Paul Volcker</a> has stepped forward, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“First of all, I don’t think (such a step) is going to have much of an impact on the economy overall.  Second of all, if you don’t do it, you can be sure that the economy will go down the drain in the next 30 years.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The IPCC report is only a small part of the iceberg leisurely cruising our way.  For example, a recent study in the journal <i>Science</i> concluded that, if we continue are present rapacious appetites, fish stocks will crash by 2048.  The decline of diversity is accelerating worldwide.  Extrapolating that trend into the future, the authors find that all species presently fished will collapse by the year 2048.  To date, there has been no substantive rebuttal to this peer-reviewed study.  (I have requested permission to quote the report directly, along with its graphs and data.  To date I have not heard from the editors.)</p>
<p>The report concludes that <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/314/5800/787?maxtoshow=&#038;HITS=20&#038;hits=20&#038;RESULTFORMAT=&#038;author1=Worm%2C+B&#038;andorexacttitle=or&#038;andorexacttitleabs=or&#038;fulltext=fish+&#038;andorexactfulltext=and&#038;searchid=1&#038;FIRSTINDEX=0&#038;sortspec=relevance&#038;fdate=7/1/2005&#038;tdate=2/28/2007&#038;resourcetype=HWCIT">there is still time to fish more intelligently to avoid such a collapse</a>.</p>
<p>What will the WTO do here?</p>
<p>And what is our projected course on CO2 emissions?  Again, I offer a small sample of where we are going.  The Energy Bulletin notes that three countries are planning to build 850 new coal plants by 2012—India, the U.S., and China.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The magnitude of that imbalance is staggering. Environmentalists have long called the [Kyoto] treaty a symbolic rather than practical victory in the fight against global warming. But even many of them do not appear aware of the coming tidal wave of greenhouse-gas emissions by nations not under Kyoto restrictions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The report continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>“By 2012, the plants in three key countries &#8211; China, India, and the United States &#8211; are expected to emit as much as an extra 2.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to a Monitor analysis of power-plant construction data. In contrast, Kyoto countries by that year are supposed to have cut their CO2 emissions by some 483 million tons.”</p></blockquote>
<p>By 2012, China is expected to add 562; India, 213; and the U.S., 72.  As for the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (<a href="http://www.energybulletin.net/3768.html">IGCC</a>),</p>
<blockquote><p>“funding for a key billion-dollar [U.S.-based] federal IGCC experimental program called FutureGen is lagging. And unless the US sets a limit on CO2 emissions that creates a market for carbon-reducing technology, there is little financial incentive to invest in such technology, experts say. As a result, the technology appears unlikely to be deployed in time to make much difference in the coming surge of power-plant construction.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless we change the way we do business, there is little hope.  Business and trade are the twin epicenters of the coming earthquake.  That earthquake will challenge traditional thinking about economics as nothing has before.  The “externalities” of which economists speak will no longer be appendages to the discussion, or afterthoughts to be consider only by politicians.  They will come marching to center stage, dominating and modifying even the principles of comparative advantage.</p>
<p>The WTO and the principles it enunciates, which seemed fair enough in a pre-21st world, are now inadequate. Countries petitioning for entry need not have any environmental regulations.</p>
<p>The WTO takes no formal position on the environment.  Countries themselves may enter into such agreements, but the WTO prefers to remain neutral to such agreements. For disputes among WTO members, however, the <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/bey2_e.htm">actual wording</a> of the position of the WTO is suggestive but allusive:</p>
<blockquote><p>“But if one side in the dispute has not signed the environment agreement, then the WTO would provide the only possible forum for settling the dispute.  The preference for handling disputes under the environmental agreements does not mean the environmental issues would be ignored in WTO disputes.  The WTO allows panels examining a dispute to seek expert advice on environmental issues.”</p></blockquote>
<p>To date, the WTO has entertained a number of environmental disputes: The “shrimp-turtle” and the “tuna-dolphin” dispute, oft cited examples.  Both of these cases involved a single endangered species.  The first involved a species of turtle that the U.S. had placed on the endangered species list.  The U.S. required that “turtle excluder” devices be placed on shrimp nets.  Because Malaysia, India, Pakistan, and Thailand did not use such devices, the U.S. put a ban on the importation of shrimp and shrimp products.  The <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/bey2_e.htm">WTO ruled against the U.S.</a>  Again, its wording is both instructive and suggestive:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In its report, the Appellate Body made clear that under WTO rules, countries have the right to take trade action to protect the environment….The WTO does not have to allow them this right.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“<i>The U.S. lost the case, not because it sought to protect the environment but because it discriminated between WTO members</i>… It provided countries in the Western hemisphere—mainly in the Caribbean—technical and financial assistance and longer transition periods for their fisherman to start using turtle-excluder devices.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The WTO can take position!  Indeed it will, even if the environmental stance of the two parties differs.</p>
<p> Neither of these cases are anything like the cases that may eventually appear. What if, for example, the fishing habits of one country threaten to crash multiple fish stocks, possibly threatening the entire food chain?  It has entered no international agreement; yea, it is blind to the effects of its present activities.  It sees only the gold in front of its eyes.  </p>
<p>Or, what if the pollution from one country actually starts to change the weather in another?  (This is actually happening.) What if, in response, the offending country is then confronted with a tariff on its goods? Such was the suggestion of French President Chirac in response to U.S. pollution: A carbon tax, really a tariff on U.S. goods. </p>
<p>Now, we can argue in this last instance of whether the pot is calling the kettle black.  Although France has made measurable steps in curbing green house gases, in all likelihood it will fail to meet Kyoto goals.  The U.S., as noted above, will continue its profligate ways.   As an aside, I wonder if Chirac would put the same tax on China and India.  To be successful in the WTO, it cannot discriminate among countries.  And how is the carbon tax to be determined&#8211;CO2 per capita emissions?  And what if the tariff itself is only tenuously or indirectly connected to the CO2 emissions? </p>
<p>To lessen the coming issues, perhaps the WTO should insist that nations petitioning for entrance have environmental regulations more in line with its present members (China excluded, of course.  That cat is out of the bag.)</p>
<p>These are tricky waters, but the WTO, unlike the U.N., has an intelligent and respected arbitration procedure that may indeed work. The U.N. is always faced with the veto.  The U.N. seems to be good at reports, not at action.  It produced the IPCC report.  I think there is a synergy here. </p>
<p>Allow me to comment on two additional issues: (1) the argument from developing nations that any such carbon tax, or even mild Kyoto, is unfair to them and (2) the rather simplistic application of comparative advantage.</p>
<p>The unfairness issue comes from two quarters.  On the one hand, we have the foreign firms and foreign financial interests within China that suddenly have become philanthropic in their motives.  The making of money is their business; to profess otherwise is to be disingenuous.</p>
<p>On the other hand, China itself decries the unfairness.  To China I would say, “Yes, it is unfair.  But you are late to the party.  The industrialize nations have theirs.  In all truth, they should share what they now have.  But you know they will not do that either—witness the sweat shop factories now gainfully employing your poor.  The question you must ask yourself is: Is there time? Is it a Pyrhhic victory you want?  </p>
<p>You and the West are like two felons handcuffed together in a burning house.  Your rich handcuffed partner wants to flee the burning building.  You, however, see a safe that could be opened.  </p>
<p>“There is not time,” your partner shouts. “Any minute now the roof will collapse on both of us.”</p>
<p>“Then give me some of what you have,” you cry, “otherwise, I am going to chance opening the safe.  I will not be poor!”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding,” he shouts.  “What’s mine is mine!”</p>
<p>And so the two of you struggle and argue as the flames leap higher and higher.</p>
<p>I would extend the story to encompass each and every one of us.  There is no escape, not for the rich who have squirreled billions into tax havens nor the poor who insist that the government widen its safety net; not for the economists who do not want to use the tools of their trade to measure “questionable” externalities nor for the investors who have their eye on the bottom line.  Everyone wants more.  Is the GDP down?  Is the stock market up?  Like the poor fools with ten maxed credit cards, our credit, too, is slowly but surely being maxed to the limit.  There is a limit to growth.  We are all subprime borrowers.  In the next twenty or thirty years, all our mortgages will be reset.</p>
<p>Take a true measure of the land and water we have poisoned in the last 50 years.  Count the species that have gone extinct in the last hundred years.   Wealthier we in the west have become.  But what has been its cost, its true cost?  Mere externalities, you say?  The initial equations supporting comparative advantage were not conceived for the problems we now face.  Real and deadly constraints confront us. </p>
<p>The house is burning; the resources are dwindling.  Whether we like it or not, the WTO will be at the center of the conflagration.  We should use this and expand this organization.</p>
