                                <p>My apologies to our readers but certain rightwing hacks are truly out of control – such of Bowtie Jr. (Tucker – you have to live with the fact that however pathetic you become, you still are not quite George Will):<br />
<blockquote>But first, global warming. An international report appeared the other day echoing what Al Gore has said for a long time: global warming is real and civilization probably is causing it. The majority of climate scientists appear to agree with this conclusion. The majority, but not all of them. George Taylor, Oregon’s longtime state climatologist, holds a contrary view. Taylor believes global warming is mostly the result of what he calls natural variations, long-term trends that humans can’t control. Among climatologists, this is not considered a crackpot view, but political in Oregon, it is heresy. The Democratic governor of that state has announced that he will trip George Taylor of his title for daring to question the causes of global warming. Keep in mind that the governor is not a scientist. He hasn’t cited any dishonesty in Taylor’s scholarship. He just doesn’t think he ought to be allowed to disagree with the conventional wisdom on global warming. But wait. Whatever happened to freedom of speech and the sanctity of the scientific process? The very people you’d expect to stand up for a scientist’s right to practice science in the face of politics have been silent in the case of George Taylor. Why? Because his position isn’t fashionable at the moment, and in the end that’s all that counts, unfortunately.</p></blockquote>
<p>Relax Tucker – no one is taking away your freedom to be always wrong as <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/02/08/oregon-denier">Faiz</a> explains:<br />
<blockquote>1) Taylor is not the “state climatologist.” Oregon abolished the position in 1989. He was bestowed the title by Oregon State University , not by Gov. Kulongoski or the state of Oregon.<br />2) Taylor is not a “climatologist.” Taylor is a meteorologist.  He does not possess a PhD or have a background in climatology.<br />3) He will not be fired. Taylor will not lose his job or income, which comes from Oregon State University. He will merely be stripped of his title, which he never earned but claims to retain. Gov. Kulongoski has the right to appoint aclimatologist who is an expert in the field and adheres to the state’s climate policies.</p></blockquote>
<p>I just wish NBC and MSNBC will exercise their right to hire competent people for their news shows.  So why does a goofball like Tucker Carlson still have a job?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As most sentient creatures and some of the folks who write at the Corner have noticed by now, the Bush administration tends to announce bad news on a Friday afternoon. I figured I&#8217;d get a jump on the rush and announce my impending demise, and that of the the Girlfriend. Yup, we&#8217;re throwing in the towel. The plan is to get married this weekend. Anyway, the friends, relatives and assorted riff-raff have started showing up, there are some last minute details to look at and I still have actual work that needs doing. Plus it occurs to me that perhaps right about now I should learn how to dance &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t want to procrastinate. </p>
<p>All of which is to say you probably won&#8217;t hear from me at least until Monday, possibly Tuesday, but as far as I know PGL and Steve Kyle don&#8217;t have an excuse of this caliber so don&#8217;t go nowhere. </p>
<p>(BTW&#8230; we&#8217;re doing this wedding thing under protest. The Girlfriend wanted the Las Vegas experience and I was eyeing the J of P route, but we were over-ridden.) </p>
<p>Now I know you&#8217;re probably worried we&#8217;ve neglected what&#8217;s really important. However, nothing could be farther from the truth. The Girlfriend and I have been discussing this for weeks now, and we finally came up with an appropriate way for her to be referred to in my posts from here on out. The first thought was Mrs. cactus, but best laid plans often don&#8217;t come to pass, so it seemed a bit presumptuous. (After all, its not too late for one or both of us to weasel out.) So we decided upon a moniker that would be accurate regardless of what happens in the next couple of days. Until further notice, she will be referred to as the &#8220;Ex-Girlfriend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toodles.</p>

<p>Recently both our own <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/david-altig-on-national-savings-and-why.html">pgl</a> and <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2007/02/us_saving_not_q.html">David Altig</a> take on the debate about savings.  David provides us with a very useful graph (showing some slight  improvement in savings in the most recent quarters) but then throws out the idea that household net wealth is still growing.  <stockticker>PGL</stockticker> replies that net wealth isn’t growing all that fast and is a notoriously noisy series anyway.  I want to make clear a few fundamental issues that I am sure David and <stockticker>PGL</stockticker> know about but which may remain a bit unclear after reading the most recent posts</p>
<p>1.  Savings is a flow and net wealth is a stock.  They are NOT different ways to measure the same thing and comparing them directly is comparing apples to oranges.  Savings is one of the ways in which net wealth is either increased (if savings is positive) or decreased (if savings is negative) in any particular period.  But net wealth also depends on capital gains which for households depend among other things on both the stock market and the value of their houses.</p>
<p>2.  To count capital gains in your house as an increase in your savings is a mistake we saw many people make during the tech stock boom a few years ago.  Your balance sheet may look great for a while but you don’t really have the money until you actually sell the asset.  It would be just as foolish today for people to say “Hey aren’t I the smart one!!  I have so much wealth in this house I am not going to sell that I should buy a new car, a plasma TV, and a European vacation!!!”</p>
<p>3.  <stockticker>PGL</stockticker> is 100% correct that asset values tend to bounce around a lot more than many other values.  I think his point about the growth in household wealth over the past few years is well taken but you could easily get different results if you choose your beginning and ending points carefully.  That is precisely what is worrying &#8211; If the housing boom ends soon as is predicted in some quarters the slight growth in household net wealth pgl notes could very easily turn into a negative number.</p>
<p>4.  The main point in my original post (which remains true even with pgl’s correction and David’s comments) is shown very clearly in David’s graph.  Those of an incurably optimistic bent – certainly a good quality to have – can hang their hat on the slight upturn in savings rates over the past few quarters.  But I defy anyone to draw a regression line through those series for the past two decades and come up with anything that has a positive slope or to be happy about where those rates are at the present time compared with other industrial countries or our own history.  And THAT was the original thought that inspired me to write about this.</p>
<p>Savings rates are usually a slow moving variable.  They don’t typically change drastically from quarter to quarter or year to year unless there is something forcing them to which is why it took 20 years for ours to decline from somewhere in the vicinity of 10% to somewhere in the vicinity of 0% or a little above.  What worries me is the possibility that something may indeed force an adjustment back the other way.  Remember that our desire to dissave must be mirrored by somebody else’s desire to save (i.e. lend us money).  It is still not at all inevitable that we will have an unpleasant adjustment forced on us but we would be foolish to act as if the current situation is either inherently stable or capable of lasting indefinitely.  If such an adjustment IS forced on us, capital gains in our houses wont help us much.  We are unlikely to all be able to sell them very fast even if they maintain their increases in value of the past few years.  And as for the likelihood that those values will keep rising all I can say is that I wouldnt want to bet the rent on it.</p>

<blockquote>But the vitriol and bullying of this crowd is something to behold.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are wondering what this is about, see <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/2007/02/jonah_goldberg_day">Matthew Yglesias</a> about that bet regarding whether they’d be an Iraq civil war.  Well, there is.  But the fun part was Jonah’s “little smear-job”:<br />
<blockquote>One caveat: Because I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right to bet on such serious matters for personal gain, if I win, I&#8217;ll donate the money to the USO. He can give it to the al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade or whatever his favorite charity is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jonah can sure dish out the cheap shots, but he can’t take people firing back.  What a cry baby!  </p>
<p>And his ability to predict what will happen in Iraq (or lack thereof) is what one would expect from a National Review neocon nitwit.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/47729">Jeff Cohen</a> unloads on Momma’s Boy as he provides some historical context:<br />
<blockquote>The bet was offered near the end of an overheated blogo-debate between Goldberg (at National Review Online) and Dr. Juan Cole, the Middle East scholar from University of Michigan.</p></blockquote>
<p>It did become overheated as Mr. Goldberg refused to stop – even as he was making the usual fool out of himself.  But check it out again as some of Dr. Cole’s comebacks were priceless!</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: When <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2005/02/playing-with-human-lives-goldbergs.html">Juan Cole</a> turned down the bet as being disgusting, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/05_02_06_corner-archive.asp#055680">Momma’s Boy</a> called it HIGH-LARIOUS and wrote:<br />
<blockquote>Lame doc, very, very lame. I&#8217;m going to take my victory lap now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jonah Goldberg can advocate sending others to war but he stays at home and makes jokes about it.  Dr. Cole was right – disgusting.</p>

                                <p>So what non-Economics blogs should someone interested in Economics read?  I&#8217;m thinking in terms of blogs that sometimes touch on economic issues, such as <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/">Obsidian Wings</a> or <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/">Matthew Yglesias</a>.  Also, policy blogs such as <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/">Ezra Klein</a> or <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/">the Carpetbagger</a>.  And don&#8217;t limit them to merely left leaning blogs.  </p>
<p>So&#8230; what should we all be reading if we want to know what&#8217;s going on?</p>

                                <p>A few weeks ago, we had a thread about what people who don&#8217;t know much about economics should read if they want to learn more.  Taking it further, what about blogs?  In your opinion, what are the best economic blogs?  Which are must read?</p>
<p>(BTW.  Two rules.  One:  nobody mentions Angry Bear.  Presumably many of you here get value from the blog, but this post was written more with &#8220;what else should we all be reading?&#8221; in mind than fishing for compliments.  Two:  keep this economics blogs.  I&#8217;ll have a second post about non-economics blogs that those with an interest in economics should read.)</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Update.  It occurs to me that comments may be biased toward the larger blogs.  There are many fine blogs that are virtually unknown because most of us have never even heard of them.  If you know of any such blog &#8211; perhaps the writer(s) only puts something up now and then, but its usually incisive &#8211; please mention it.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I grew up in the 1960’s thinking Meet the Press was a first class show on the issues of the day.  Over the past few years, I have watched its current host ruin this once great program.  But I should just turn the microphone over to a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2007/02/08/BL2007020801013_pf.html">real journalist</a>:<br />
<blockquote>If you&#8217;re a journalist, and a very senior White House official calls you up on the phone, what do you do? Do you try to get the official to address issues of urgent concern so that you can then relate that information to the public? Not if you&#8217;re NBC Washington bureau chief Tim Russert. When then-vice presidential chief of staff Scooter Libby called Russert on July 10, 2003, to complain that his name was being unfairly bandied about by MSNBC host Chris Matthews, Russert apparently asked him nothing. And get this: According to Russert&#8217;s testimony yesterday at Libby&#8217;s trial, when any senior government official calls him, they are presumptively off the record. That&#8217;s not reporting, that&#8217;s enabling.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dan is not just going over Tim Russert:<br />
<blockquote>And the behavior of elite members of Washington&#8217;s press corps &#8211; sometimes appearing more interested in protecting themselves and their cozy &#8220;sources&#8221; than in informing the public &#8211; is also being exposed for all the world to see. For Russert, yesterday&#8217;s testimony was the second source of trial-related embarrassment in less than two weeks. The first came when Cathie Martin, Cheney&#8217;s former communications director, testified that the vice president&#8217;s office saw going on Russert&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; as a way to go public but &#8220;control [the] message.&#8221; In other words: Sure, there might be a tough question or two, but Russert could be counted on not to knock the veep off his talking points &#8211; and, in that way, give him just the sort of platform he was looking for.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the NBC wing of Faux News.  This is the same Russert who went “no, no, no, no, no” to Howard Dean back during the 2004 campaign when Dean got the number of troops in Iraq correct.  And there was a second “no, no, no, no, no” when Dean answered one of Russert’s Social Security questions correctly.  But I guess we should forgive this last one as Russert is about as stupid on the Social Security issue as it gets – even if he pretends he’s an expert (expert at reader Karl Rove spin perhaps).  </p>
<p>But go back to those Russert interviews of Dick Cheney and watch how many times the Vice President has flat out lied to the host of Meet the Press.  Why does Cheney lie to Mr. Russert?  Because he knows that when he does so – Russert will say “thank you Mr. Vice President for sharing your views”. </p>
<p>Memo to NBC News – fire Tim Russert TODAY and hire someone who can restore Meet the Press to where it used to be when I was young.</p>

                                <p>Jim Caserta sent me a post he wrote about the factors on the Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom.  He looked at how <a href="http://jimcaserta.blogspot.com/2007/02/digging-deeper-into-heritage-foundation.html">factors on the index correlated with GDP per capita</a>.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you read the post, and only add that perhaps its time for Heritage to be less concerned with taxes and government.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/07/AR2007020702550.html">Shailagh Murray</a> reports that we may about to witness the return of the Senate:<br />
<blockquote>Senate Republicans who earlier this week helped block deliberations on a resolution opposing President Bush&#8217;s new troop deployments in Iraq changed course yesterday and vowed to use every tactic at their disposal to ensure a full and open debate. In a letter distributed yesterday evening to Senate leaders, John W. Warner (Va.), Chuck Hagel (Neb.) and five other GOP supporters of the resolution threatened to attach their measure to any bill sent to the floor in the coming weeks. Noting that the war is the &#8220;most pressing issue of our time,&#8221; the senators declared: &#8220;We will explore all of our options under the Senate procedures and practices to ensure a full and open debate.&#8221; &#8230; The letter began circulating yesterday evening after it became apparent the Senate was deadlocked over the war resolution and Reid was prepared to move on to other matters. McConnell and many in his party have aggressively defended their decision to block the bipartisan resolution as an issue of fairness because Democrats would not agree to GOP procedural demands. But some Republicans were uneasy about appearing to have stymied the debate. The letter appeared so suddenly that, although it was addressed to Reid, the Democratic leader had not seen his copy before Warner read the text on the Senate floor. &#8220;Monday&#8217;s procedural vote should not be interpreted as any lessening of our resolve to go forward advocating the concepts&#8221; of the resolution, the letter said. &#8220;The current stalemate is unacceptable to us and to the people of this country.&#8221; &#8230; A top Pentagon leader weighed in yesterday on the war debate and appeared to undercut the argument advanced by the White House and many GOP lawmakers that a congressional debate challenging the Bush plan would hurt troop morale. &#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that the dialogue here in Washington strengthens our democracy. Period,&#8221; Marine Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the House Armed Services Committee. He added that potential enemies may take some comfort from the rancor but said they &#8220;don&#8217;t have a clue how democracy works.&#8221; &#8230; The other Republican senators who signed the letter were Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, Norm Coleman (Minn.), Gordon Smith (Ore.), and George V. Voinovich (Ohio). Democrats brushed off the Republicans&#8217; declaration as too little, too late. Reid spokesman Jim Manley said in a statement: &#8220;Senator Reid gave Senator Warner and the others a chance to vote for their own resolution on Monday, but only two of them chose to do so. Hopefully this letter signifies that the others have had a change of heart, and will be willing to vote for their own resolution in the future.&#8221;&#8230; House Democrats had hoped for a large bipartisan Senate vote on Warner&#8217;s resolution to create momentum in the House and to provide maximum pressure on Republicans to go along. But with the Senate at a standstill, House leaders are considering a straightforward resolution that opposes the troop increase, without the multiple provisions that complicated Warner&#8217;s text. Senior House Democrats predicted that their measure will attract overwhelming party support and possibly as many as 30 GOP votes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can someone tell me why the Senate Democrats were so willing to let Mitch McConnell’s tactics block this debate?  We should all applaud Senator Warner and the other six GOP Senators who are willing to stall the passage of these spending bills (the ones the last Congress under GOP control never got around to) until Warner’s resolution is voted on.  Just imagine 80 Senators giving this White House what amounts to a no confidence vote.  We should also thank General Pace for his comments, which undercut the garbage from this White House about not supporting the troops.  It would appear to me that Senator Warner is challenging the leadership of Mitch McConnell.  All I have to add is: <strong>IT’S ABOUT TIME!</strong></p>
<p><em>Update</em>: The <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MmUwZmExNmQzZmM2NGYyMzQwMWUxZWUzYzBmYjE0NjM=">National Review</a> praises the stalling tactics of Mitch “all we want is an up or down vote” McConnell, while <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZjY1MTQ4NTcwZDc3ZWEwZDc5NzMwN2NlOWRhMjRkY2M=">Fred Eckert</a> mocks those who would put forth such resolutions:<br />
<blockquote>Besides the affront to the Constitution, what we have been witnessing demonstrates a frightening lack of clear thinking and common sense. These congressmen have been undermining the morale of our troops, uplifting the spirit of our enemies, and making fools of themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right boys and girls, the National Review will publish any rubbish that backs the tyrannical behavior of the Liar-in-Chief.  Thank goodness that there are a few Republican Senators who actually understand both the Constitution and what is right for our nation.</p>
<p><em>Update II</em>: Thanks to the reader who pointed out that the article was referring to 30 House Republicans – not 30 Senate Republicans.  My apologies for hoping too much!</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>We’re at the last of <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg2001.cfm">Brian Riedl’s Ten Myths</a>.  Before I go on, I’d like to thank Brian Riedl.  Despite the snark, not to say uncalled for insults, I hurled in his direction at the beginning of this process, he’s been a good sport, and he’s been taking time to come here and argue the points.  Given that the budget has just been released, it’s a very busy week for him, so the time issue should not be underestimated.  </p>
<p>Here’s Myth 10 </p>
<p>“Myth #10: The Bush tax cuts were tilted toward the rich.<br />Fact: The rich are now shouldering even more of the income tax burden.”</p>
<p>Riedl is right about this, but I don&#8217;t think its a selling point.  Recall that, as I noted in another post, <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">real per capita income has been declining</a>.  In fact, it declined every year from 2000 until 2004.  Its up in 2005 but still below 2000 level.  Aside from whether having the wealthy pay a greater share of the tax burden than before is enough to make up for the fact that most of us have less income than ever before, it should be noted that the real GDP per capita is growing.  If on average we have less real income but real GDP per capita is growing, where is the extra income going?  Presumably to the folks at the top.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Census doesn’t break down data on real income per person into quintiles (unless I’m just not seeing it), but they do provide <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h02ar.html">share of aggregate income received by each fifth and top 5 percent</a>.  Since 2000, the share going to the bottom 3 quintiles has dropped.  The fourth quintile has stayed constant, and the fifth quintile has seen an increase.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f02ar.html">Family income shows a similar pattern</a>, except that the fourth quintile is also slightly better off since 2000.)</p>
<p>Thus… the wealthy are paying more because they are becoming more wealthy while everyone else is getting poorer.  (Note – this is not to bash GW.  These trends have been around for a while.  The same could have been said under Clinton, for example.)  Even under a flat tax that would be true.</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Update&#8230;.  Check out the second table on this page which shows <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f01ar.html">real income per family by quintiles and the top 5%</a> in constant 2005 dollars.  (The first table shows nominal dollars.)  The bottom quintile is making more money than in 2000, and quintiles 2 through 5 are making less.  The ones making out like bandits are the top 5%.  The same is true since 2001.  In other words&#8230; sure, the rich are paying more.  Under Clinton, even if the distribution got more uneven, everyone got better off.  Under GW, most people are getting screwed.</p>
<p>So sure, Riedl is right.  The rich are paying more.  But that&#8217;s because, unlike the rest of us, they&#8217;re making more money than they were in 2000.</p>
