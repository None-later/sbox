                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>Robert Barro wrote <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123258618204604599.html">an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal</a>.  The substance of the op-ed is to report an estimate of the Fiscal multiplier 0.8 which is less than one.  Thus, according to Barro, a stimulus will partially crowd out of investment, consumption or net exports and not just reduced leisure.   Paul Krugman <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/war-and-non-remembrance/">took Barro to task</a> for using the huge WWII stimulus in his estimates, since the economy was at full employment during WWII.  So have <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/01/multipliers_and_diminishing_returns.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> using his Harvard BA in philosophy from Harvard and <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/01/spending_during_a_recession.html">Kevin Drum</a> using his BA in Communications from The California State University in Long Beach.  </p>
<p>I might want to reassess Long Beach State, but I think the reason that Yglesias and Drum immediately make the same argument is Krugman is that Yglesias and Drum don&#8217;t know about modern econometrics.  Barro is using an instrumental variables regression in which wartime military spending is considered to be an exogenous variable which is correlated with government consumption.  The implicit assumption is that we can safely assume that the fiscal multiplier today is identical to the fiscal multiplier during World War II, because the economy is basically similar.  Without training in modern econometrics it is simply impossible to assume something that stupid.</p>
<p>There is also a severe gap in economic theory, at least as remembered by Robert Barro.  Wouldn&#8217;t one think that there must be some model in which correlations vary depending on the general conditions of the economy &#8212; say like whether at current prices there is excess demand for goods or excess supply of goods.</p>
<p>Of course, no one could expect Barro to know that there is a vaguely Keynesian model, which differs from the neoclassical model only because of rigid nominal wages and prices, in which the economy can be in one of three different regimes, Keynsian (with insufficient aggregate demand), Classical (firms can sell as much as they want but real wages are too high so workers are unemployed) and repressed inflation (excess supply of labor and goods).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m mean who&#8217;s ever heard of the Barro-Grossman model (<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1910543">A General Disequilibrium Model of Income and Employment</a> Barro, Robert J.; Grossman, Herschel I.; American Economic Review, March 1971, v. 61, iss. 1, pp. 82-93 [stable JSTOR link added for those with access])? Certainly not Robert Barro.</p>
<p>The passage quoted by Krugman about what Keynes thought is inconsistent with The General Theory. However, it can be corrected easily. The accurate description of the history of economic thought is &#8220;<strike>John Maynard Keynes </strike>Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman thought that the problem lay with wages and prices &#8230; will mean that wages and prices do not have to fall.&#8221; </p>
<p>Look I sympathise.  Like Barro, when I was young and reckless I did embarrassing things which I have tried to cancel from my memory.  I really wish I could do that as well as he has.</p>

<p>Historically quality spreads are leading and/or concurrent indicators of  capacity utilization.</p>
<p>So are these extreme quality spreads a forecast of capacity utilization and/or the economy?</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2009/01/11877_change_you_can_click_on.html">Motherjones</a> has a note on the new Whitehouse website.  I point out some additional information of a new contract with America.</p>
<blockquote><p>    An off-line Obama isn&#8217;t just bad for Barack. It&#8217;s bad for all of us. The president&#8217;s ability to reach outside his inner circle gives him access to fresh ideas and constructive critics; it underscores the difference between political &#8220;victories&#8221; and actual solutions; and it brings the American people into a battle we can only win by working together.</p>
<p>I hope Obama can take the attitude Podesta has about his BlackBerry and apply it throughout government. Making WhiteHouse.gov more than just a place for press releases and photo ops would be a great place to start. How about bringing the transition&#8217;s &#8220;Open for Questions&#8221; feature over to the new site? Just asking&#8230;</p>
<p>Update: I&#8217;m not the only one noticing the changes. Over at Slate, Farhad Manjoo notes that Obama plans to keep a crucial campaign promise: posting non-emergency legislation on the White House website for five days and allowing (and reviewing) comments. Manjoo also noticed some bugs: &#8220;A flashy slide show of past presidents fails to include anyone past Gerald Ford&#8221; and &#8220;when you Google George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, FDR, or any other past president, you get now-broken links to their bios on the White House site.&#8221; Let&#8217;s hope the White House webmasters get all that fixed—we wouldn&#8217;t want FDR falling in those Google ratings.</p>
<p>Update 2: Speaking of Google ratings, Jason Kottke points to the new website&#8217;s robots.txt file, which tells search engines what parts of the site to include in results, as &#8220;a small and nerdy measure of the huge change in the executive branch of the US government today.&#8221; The Bush administration&#8217;s version of the robots.txt file had 2400 lines of code for what it didn&#8217;t want people finding on Google. The Obama administration has one. </p></blockquote>
<p>Update:  On the robot.txt hat tip Kolohe</p>
<blockquote><p><a target="_blank" href="http://copyrightsandcampaigns.blogspot.com/2009/01/new-obama-white-house-web-site.html">Declan McCullagh points out in CNET</a>:</p>
<p>    There&#8217;s just one problem with these comments. They&#8217;re wrong. As of Tuesday morning, the Bush administration&#8217;s robots.txt file did only two things: first, it pointed search engines to the high-graphics versions of the page, as opposed to the text-only versions, and second, it tried to keep type-in-your-search-query pages from being indexed.</p></blockquote>

<p>On Hayek you prove that Hayek claimed that the UK was on the road to serfdom, you don&#8217;t prove that he claimed that it had gone beyond the point of no return on that road, that a U-turn before arrival at Serfdom was impossible.</p>
<p>Odd. Hayek definitely did claim exactly that. He was a serious thinker and felt obliged to derive a testable prediction from his hypothesis. He noted (in the original main body of the book) that he had arrived at such a prediction in conversations with friends. He did not say that Karl Popper was one of those friends but that is my (untestable) hypothesis.</p>
<p>So he made a prediction specifically about when the progress towards serfdom was irreversible, no turning around before gettting there. He say that point of no return was the impossition of restrictions on the expatriation of wealth. His hypothesis stands or falls on the validity of the prediction that no country can impose such controls and then turn back before reaching full serfdom.</p>
<p>The Atlee government imposed such controls. Actually when I moved to Italy, Italy had such controls. Either the Thatcher governments were, in Hayek&#8217;s view, an irrelevant bump in the road to serfdom, or his clearly stated prediction was refuted by the data.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t notice Hayek saying that Thatcher made no difference and that England was still as irreversibly doomed to serfdom as it was in 1946. I repeat, he was a serious thinker so, when he presented a hypothesis, he made a firm prediction. To be clearer, he was a serious thinker, in 1945, so he made a firm prediction in 1945.</p>
<p>Then he decided that his ideology was more precious to him than his intellectual integrity and neglected to confront his clear prediction with the facts or admit that he was wrong in 1945</p>

<p>The Most Unpleasant Post I&#8217;ll Ever Write&#8230; and It Is About World Peace</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t like this post.  I don&#8217;t like what I wrote in it.  Unfortunately, it seems accurate to me.  So here goes&#8230;</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has no troubles with Zoroastrians, Christians, Jews, or Shia Muslims.  The Zoroastrians, Christians, and Jews who were native to the area were wiped out.  The Shia minority, about 15% of the population, knows to watch itself.  As in, they know they will get beheaded (quite literally) for any activities with which the ruling regime doesn&#8217;t like. </p>
<p>Jordan, for the most part, can be described as a nation of Palestinians ruled by a family that was imposed on them by the British.  The Hashemite family has few problems maintaining control, however, since September of 1970 (i.e., Black September)  1970-1971, when they demonstrated how they would react to any sign of rebellion.</p>
<p>There was a time when many Muslims considered Alawites, the minority sect that runs Syria, to be non-Muslim.  I believe the Hama massacre marks the last time anyone in Syria questioned whether the Alawites are Muslim, or made noises about whether members of that sect should be running the country.</p>
<p>When the Arabs invaded Egypt, they referred to the Egyptians as Copts.  These days, the Copts are a persecuted minority.  (And yes, Boutros Boutros-Gali is a Copt, but that doesn&#8217;t change their persecuted minority status.)</p>
<p>The pattern I&#8217;m getting at, sadly, is that peace only arrives through superior firepower and willingness to use it in the Middle East.  And its not just the Middle East.  Think of the Ainu in Japan, the Aborigines in Australia, the Native Americans in the US, and anyone who isn&#8217;t a Han in China.</p>
<p>The flip side of the coin is this: Lebanon is not a country at peace &#8211; or rather, when it is at peace, its never for long.  The various warring sides are too evenly matched for any side to impose its will upon the others, so peace never lasts.  But I think its fair to say that if one of the sides was able to impose its will on the others through violence, it would.  Lord knows, there have been enough massacres in Lebanon by all sides to demonstrate that every one of them would happily make any sort of demonstration they felt would end things on their terms if they thought they could do it.  I can think of only a few situations where a side that faced violence (whether merited or not) and had the wherewithal to end the violence by demonstrating a willingness to completely destroy the other side has not done so.   One is when the side that has that ability has gotten tired.  The loss of the Soviet Empire could have been averted had the Soviets simply been willing to nuke one or another Eastern European capital.  (Note that I&#8217;m not advocating this, mind you, merely stating what would have kept the empire intact.)  The Civil War in Chechnya is another sign the Russians are tired.  </p>
<p>Another situation that comes to mind is the one between Israel and the Palestinians.  As much as the Israelis &#8211; if they were willing to do to Gaza City what the folks running their neighboring countries have done to at least one of their own cities in the not so distant past, and what Hamas would happily do to Tel Aviv if given a chance, the whole place would be as quiet as Saudi Arabia or Jordan.  Note again  &#8211; I am not advocating this behavior, nor am I am saying the Israelis are right in this conflict &#8211; I am stating a fact as I see it.  </p>
<p>In this post I&#8217;ve avoided the issue of what constitutes the boundaries of a country&#8230; which sometimes stretch, as in China absorbing Tibet.  (I think that&#8217;s best explained by Ronald Coase in Theory of the Firm, I might add.)  But I&#8217;ve also avoided making calls on a whole range of moral issues, such as whether the folks who were &#8220;first&#8221; were really there &#8220;first&#8221; or whether they just kicked out or oppressed some other group that was there &#8220;firster.&#8221; Most of the oppressed groups I mentioned above were previously oppressors in the same area.  Aztlan was only paradise to the folks running the Aztec empire.  Also &#8211; does or should being there first confer ownership rights on one&#8217;s descendants a few hundred or thousand years later?  Especially given all the mixing of genes that went on along the way?  </p>
<p>But let me raise two, and only two moral questions.  Say that there were such a thing, collectively, as the Israeli consciousness, and it had to decide what to do.  Given that it is facing an enemy bent on its destruction, given that it has the capability of achieving the peace that its neighbors (other than Lebanon) have achieved if it demonstrated enough ruthlessness, what would you do if you were that collective consciousness?   And before you speak about how one or another action would destroy your soul, consider this: when you sum up all the people who ever lived in all the places that took the delenda est approach &#8211; which pretty much covers everyone alive today, you won&#8217;t find more than a handful that have ever regretted it.  (You will find regret among those who have had the delenda est approach applied more recently to their group than their group managed to apply to others, but that would stop very few of them from turning around and using that approach if given a chance.) </p>
<p>Which brings up the second question&#8230;  why aren&#8217;t the Israelis doing it? Its certainly not good press; based on the experience of the Saudis or Jordanians, its clear you get better press for being more ruthless than less.  So what is going on?<br />________________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p>Gary Farber (so far only <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=117007680572">via Facebook</a>) (<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Now <a href="http://amygdalagf.blogspot.com/2009/01/buffy-can-i-borrow-stake-via-hilzoy.html">here</a>) finds a reprint from <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/19330308/editors?rel=hp_currently">the 8 March 1933 issue of The Nation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>At the risk of gilding the tinsel, let the record be set down finally as The Nation takes leave this week of the &#8220;only party fit to rule.&#8221; American memories are short. Four years from now the public will be asked to restore the Republicans and prosperity.</p>
<p>Let it therefore be recalled, now and henceforth, that four years ago not a cloud even as large as a man&#8217;s hand had appeared in the heavens. That it was, from the financial standpoint, a clear blue sky may have had a certain prophetic symbolism which was overlooked at the time. Herbert Hoover was about to assume the Presidency&#8230;.</p>
<p>In his acceptance address the previous August Mr. Hoover had declared:</p>
<p>We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land. The poorhouse is vanishing from among us. We have not yet reached the goal, but, given a chance to go forward with the policies of the last eight years, and we shall soon, with the help of God, be in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this nation. There is no guaranty against poverty equal to a job for every man. That is the primary purpose of the economic policies we advocate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/01/paul-wolfowitz-slams-george-w-bush.html">as Paul Wolfowitz observed</a>, policies should always be evaluated by their results, not their purposes.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb<br />A little antidote to Amity Shlaes and the other New Deal Deniers. From TPM Cafe J.K. Galbraith introduces Marshall Auerback<br />
<blockquote>The view that the New Deal was too small and accomplished little, that only WWII ended the Depression, is very widely held. But it is not correct. It is based on a mis-reading of reconstructed unemployment statistics from that time, which treat the workers actually employed by the New Deal as though they were unemployed. Which they were not.</p>
<p>In fact, the New Deal accomplished a huge amount, both in specific construction projects and in providing employment to the American people.</p>
<p>I am going to turn over my microphone, not for the first time, to Marshall Auerback, and quote at great length from his paper entitled &#8220;A New New Deal.&#8221; Those wishing to get the whole paper should contact Marshall at mauer1959@aol.com</p></blockquote>
<p>While Galbraith has permission to cite this paper at length I don&#8217;t know that I do. But I do know the topic is of extreme importance in light of the Republicans&#8217; clear plan to sabotage the stimulus package in favor of tried (I mean tired) and true tax cuts on capital. <br />Link to extract from Auerbach <a target="_blank" href="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/01/21/unemployment_statistics_of_the_new_deal_era/#more">Unemployment Statistics Of The New Deal Era</a> I thought the following was particularly interesting<br />
<blockquote>Even pro-Roosevelt historians such as William Leuchtenburg and Doris Kearns Goodwin have meekly accepted that the millions of people in the New Deal workfare programs were unemployed, while comparable millions of Germans and Japanese, and eventually French and British, who were dragooned into the armed forces and defense production industries in the mid-and late 1930s, were considered to be employed.</p></blockquote>
<p> Forced by Hitler to build tanks and bombs? Gainfully employed. Asked by Roosevelt to build parks and schools? Makework slacker who is certainly not &#8217;employed&#8217;. Now THAT is a perverse use of statistics.</p>

<p>Noni Mausa in comments reminds us:</p>
<blockquote><p>(We forget)&#8230;.how essential it is to understand sound and unsound arguments.  Arguments are one tool of winning or losing in the struggle against your opponent and his definition of reality &#8212; a definition which will effect your life and improve his (or else why would he bother?)  </p>
<p>If you get your opponent to accept your definitions. and your terms of discourse, that&#8217;s often the first and last move in winning the contest.  Structuring an apparent argument out of those is becoming less important, more&#8217;s the pity.  But the pundits have to do it, or how would they fill out their columns?  </p>
<p>In 1932, a Dorothy L. Sayers mystery discussed a point of logic, in among the cut throats and the pursuit of an itinerant barber.  It was just a little throwaway paragraph to illustrate how stupid the murderer was.  </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;but [Weldon] failed to detect either the petitio eleuchi, the undistributed middle or the inaccurate major premise which it contrived to combine&#8230;&#8221;  </p>
<p>And Bill Peschel, in his handy notations site here:  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.planetpeschel.com/index?/wimsey/index/">gives definitions</a>:  </p>
<p>&#8212; petitio eleuchi: begging the question &#8220;using as a premise in an argument something that should be the conclusion.&#8221;  <br />&#8212; undistributed middle: The official definition is &#8220;The middle term in the premises of a standard form categorical syllogism never refers to all of the members of the category it describes.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Granted that Sayers&#8217; readers were smarter than most, still the 1932 reader was perhaps more likely to understand the subtleties of Weldon&#8217;s mistake than the modern reader.  </p>
<p>This is no minor point &#8212; these are not airy-fairy technicalities, they are the nuts and bolts of thought.  Not understanding them is as hazardous as not understanding electricity if you happen to be wiring a house.  </p>

                                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://geocities.com/stuartthiel/">Stuart Eugene Thiel</a> is a retired lawyer and economics professor (at least he taught at Wash. St and DePaul U&#8217;s) who comments around the blogosphere here and there. But to me he will always be Prof. Pollkatz proprietor of a really fantastic polling website with a concentration on Bush approval as aggregated from 15 national polls:  <a href="http://pollkatz.homestead.com/">Professor Pollkatz&#8217;s Poll of Polls</a> Prof. Pollkatz graciously has made his graphics available for distribution as long as it is free, reproduced in its entirely and clearly shows his name. Conditions I think I met (certainly nobody is paying me for content here).</p>
<p>His work did a huge service to those of us who couldn&#8217;t figure out why the American people continued to support Bush. And the answer was that they really didn&#8217;t. Instead they rallied around the Commander in Chief at three separate points: 9/11, the Fall of the Statue (capture of Baghdad), and the capture of Saddam. At all intervals in between he lost approval at a steady rate. Prof. Pollkatz shows this with these  two graphics (among others). I am having trouble getting the second one to load (the one that shows the spikes), so I&#8217;ll try to get it up in comments.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SXY704KrbKI/AAAAAAAAAEA/eMEuk2JLtxY/s1600-h/zzzBUSHINDEX_3014_image001.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SXY704KrbKI/AAAAAAAAAEA/eMEuk2JLtxY/s320/zzzBUSHINDEX_3014_image001.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>(Click on graphic to enlarge) This is really an amazing result. Bush never had any significant year over year improvement. He fractionally beat his previous number in a handful of shown sample points. But in total you can&#8217;t really quarell with Prof. Pollkatz&#8217;s caption.</p>
<p>Prof. Pollkatz shuttered his site on Nov. 8th with the signoff: &#8220;My work is finished. Farewell. We done good. Yes We DID.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well I can&#8217;t disagree  with that. Consider this a lovely parting gift for the political genius Karl Rove. Nothing he did actually worked in any substantial way. His client bled support almost from beginning to end, numbers boosted by three events which were largely or totally out of either man&#8217;s control.</p>
