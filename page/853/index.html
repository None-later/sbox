                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>If <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/08/AR2007050801580.html">this stupidity</a> were arguing for free trade, it would have to be run over at the National Review.  But Robert Samuelson is coming up with some incredibly stupid arguments for trade protection.  He starts off with a few facts:</p>
<blockquote><p>It sometimes seems as if almost everything we buy comes from China: DVD players, computers, shoes, toys, socks. This is, of course, a myth. In 2006, imports from China totaled $288 billion, about 16 percent of all U.S. imports and equal to only 2 percent of America&#8217;s $13.2 trillion economic output</p></blockquote>
<p>OK – we bought almost as much from China as we did from Canada in 2006.  But here is where this gets really silly:</p>
<blockquote><p>On its present course, it threatens to wreck the entire post-World War II trading system. Constructed largely by the United States, that system has flourished because its benefits are widely shared. Since 1950, global trade has expanded by a factor of 25. By contrast, China&#8217;s trade is mercantilist: It&#8217;s designed to benefit China even if it harms its trading partners.</p></blockquote>
<p>Accusing a trade partner of being mercantilist as an excuse to adopt trade protection?!  The mind boggles.  When Robert Samuelson complains about the undervalued exchange rate, he is on somewhat stronger grounds, but then he returns to sheer insanity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Personal consumption spending is a meager 38 percent of GDP; that&#8217;s half the U.S. rate of 70 percent. The Chinese save at astonishingly high levels, partly because they&#8217;re scared of emergencies. The social safety net is skimpy. Health insurance is modest: Out-of-pocket spending covers half of medical costs, reports economist Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute. There&#8217;s no universal Social Security, and only 17 percent of workers have pensions. A mere 14 percent are covered by unemployment insurance. The surplus of personal savings, supplemented by business savings and foreign capital, means that Chinese and multinational firms can build more factories &#8211; and that raises the need to export.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s be honest.  We don’t really have a great handle on why the Chinese consumption to GDP ratio is less than 40%.  My view is that part of this may be a measurement issue.  But let’s concede that Americans save less than the Chinese.  As our national savings falls short of our domestic investment, we tend to borrow from nations that saving more than they invest.  On the other hand, Chinese is lending funds to American firms that invest here.  We could also get into the fallacy that American firms are doing a massive amount of direct investment abroad – but didn’t we cover this showing that the data isn’t quite there?  </p>
<p>OK, China is not only lending to us so we can invest more than we save but they are also investing a lot in their own factories.  Which would tend to increase the demand for Chinese workers, which will eventually increase their wages.  And as their incomes rise, won’t that mean they’ll consume more someday?  </p>
<p>Someone please call Paul Samuelson.  Maybe he’ll take the time to explain the basics to Robert Samuelson.  Or maybe he’ll simply ask Robert to use a different last name for such incredibly dumb opeds.</p>

<blockquote><p>OK, so &#8220;there is no evidence” the accused Ft. Dix plotters “received direction from international foreign terrorist organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, as many in the MSM are noting, they do not appear to be highly trained professionals. That’s true also of others arrested since 9/11 (e.g. Richard Reid and the cells in Buffalo, NY and Florida).</p>
<p>What is not being mentioned: This could be a very positive sign. It could mean that we’ve eliminated many of the most skilled and experienced terrorists, many of the most qualified terrorist trainers and international ring masters — that we’ve either killed them or imprisoned them at Guantanamo or at some secret prison somewhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>The terrorists who bombed the WTC in 1993 were not very good at their jobs. Over the next 8 years, al Qaeda climbed a steep learning curve while U.S. intelligence analysts, covert operatives, military and law enforcement officers did little to prevent it.</p>
<p>If we’ve learned from that, good for our side, good for Bush and the CIA and the FBI and others all of us criticize.</p></blockquote>
<p>May is partly wrong.  (Presumably, they wouldn&#8217;t let him put something up at the National Review if he wasn&#8217;t at least partly wrong.)  The folks that carried out 9/11 were pretty incompetent too.  It wasn&#8217;t exactly a difficult thing to do at the time.  The concept showed a bit of imagination, but not a huge amount:  crashing planes into things had been done before in books, and I would think, in movies.  And I&#8217;ve been saying for a while:  Al Qaeda is incompetent.  And the folks our troops are battling in Iraq are pretty incompetent.  Its their incompetence that saves us given the quality of our leadership.</p>
<p>Think for just a few minutes.  Say you have a few men that aren&#8217;t afraid to die and have no qualms about killing innocent people at your disposal and your goal was to cause as much damage as possible to American society.  You should be able to come up with a few that would have large effect on American society, even if the only qualifications of those men is that they can handle a weapon or a bomb and can walk down a city street without calling excessive attention to themselves.  With 19 such men, the number employed on 9/11, you can shut down Las Vegas, or every large university in the country, or (more chillingly) every elementary school in any big city in the country for weeks.  And you can do it in one day at very low cost, and you might not even lose most of your 19 men so you can do it again.</p>
<p>And yet, so far, thank goodness, our enemies haven&#8217;t been able to muster even that.  Counting on their continued stupidity, ineptitude and stupidity is not a good thing.  Of course, they&#8217;re counting on ours, and so far so good for Osama.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Update&#8230; its not just them foreigner crazies that are incompetent.  Our homegrown variety are generally not that bright either.  McVeigh clearly did quite a bit without using much equipment, so he is something of an exception.  But consider what Eric Rudolph might have pulled off with some brains.  And having smarts in one area doesn&#8217;t mean competence at wreaking havoc or the Unabomber might have done a lot more damage.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Note&#8230; please, no suggestions as to how someone could &#8220;do it&#8221; in comments.  Thanks.</p>

<p>Transport of water as an issue that the Romans ignored. They failed because they could not get the lead out.</p>
<p>Bruce Webb’s comments on water transport got me to thinking a bit. Water transport could be considered getting water from point A to Point B. I know, what can you expect from a mental health guy. As I have progressed in research, drinking water and agricultural use of water were separated because closed pipe systems need to be treated differently from other from other systems.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that transport then includes the urban system network of closed pipes, and that leakage is part of the system. If true, then there is a <a href="http://www.unece.org/spot/s06.htm">problem</a>. You run smack into the huge expense of leakage and how to get the money to repair old systems. Jolly England grapples with their market. The southwest urban users have a big problem as well, because what happens if water becomes truly expensive and infrastructure becomes worthwhile to repair. All of a sudden we seem to have real problems as prices rise due to what… relative scarcity?</p>
<p>Run for the oceans is a reasonable response if ignoring unintended consequences for what would be extraordinary demand on the ocean, but is limited to lower elevations and such as described <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/sgc/wpaper/41.html">here</a>. Except there still is the same kind of problems we see from any source. </p>
<p>Which brings me to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">bottled water experiment</a> in England and elsewhere that saves us money. Fiji water itself is not so expensive, is it? $1.50? Free water one place transported to richer areas. What impact does this have on winners and losers? Does Fiji water actually come from Fiji, or are empty containers made somewhere else, and local tap water used to fill them? Beats transporting the stuff and local tap water is cheap.</p>
<p>There are a number of notions to consider in further posts, but the next will try to summarize after comments. I have not introduced examples of disasters and failures yet because I would like to have some honest and viable successes to explore. Any help?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Not long ago, I had a post on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/nigerians-big-penises-and-big-breasts.html">various kinds of spam</a>.  Interestingly enough, the other day I went to our site meter <a href="http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&#038;s=sm9angrybear">site meter</a> (the little button on the right will take you there) and noticed that we were still getting hits for that, by way of google. (Check the &#8220;entry pages&#8221; and &#8220;referral&#8221; pages in the site meter.) Not a huge amount of traffic, but some, well, trickle.</p>
<p>Curious, I went to google. I found that Angry Bear was the twelfth site that came up when one entered the words &#8220;big&#8221; and &#8220;breasts&#8221; and ran a search. Last night we had dropped to sixteenth. I blame the Ex-GF, at least in part. As I was playing around she insisted on clicking on some of our competitors to see what they were about. She asks me to pass on one bit of information to you, our readers: it seems that bra-sizes E, F, G and H do exist. </p>
<p>Having grown up in South America, I don&#8217;t have the fascination that many American men have with large breasts. (I was told a few times &#8211; I haven&#8217;t verified it &#8211; that until very recently, breast enlargement was virtually unknown in Brazil, and that the number one plastic surgery in the country was breast reduction.) As a result, I&#8217;m willing to accept (barely) that we are number 12 in the big breast rankings. But 16? Or even drop further? I hope you, our loyal Angry Bear readers, will do something about this shameful situation. </p>
<p>And BTW&#8230; we&#8217;re not among the top 500 when it comes to the words &#8220;big&#8221; and &#8220;penis.&#8221; I think I can speak for some of the other Angry Bears when I say I&#8217;m feeling very inadequate about this.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/04/trade_and_the_m.html">Alex Tabarrok</a> does an excellent job of summing up what Dani Rodrik has been saying about how a movement towards free trade has both winners and losers.  Alex tags Dani’s argument – which I have applauded – as the nationalist view.  It goes something like this – when Americans like “Peter” trade with Mexicans like “Jose”, there are other Americans such as “Joe” who may suffer a decline in real income.  But then Alex reminds me that I’m a liberal internationalist:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would argue, however, that economists are too quick to take the nation as the relevant moral community.  It is quite possible, for example, for Peter to benefit from trade but for Peter&#8217;s city to be harmed, for Peter&#8217;s state to benefit but for his region to be harmed, for his country to benefit but for his continent to be harmed.  Why should we cut the cake in one way, excluding some from the moral community, but not in another?  Indeed, geography is not the only way we can define the moral community.  Why not ask whether English speakers benefit from free trade or Christians or left handed people?  Each of these is just as valid as asking whether the collection of people called the nation benefit from free trade. I understand individual rights and I understand counting everyone equally but I see less value in counting some in and some out based on arbitrary characteristics like which side of the border the actors fall on.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Lou Dobbs wing of the Democratic Party complain that Joe’s income – which may be seen as somewhere between middle class to working poor – is diminished by free trade pacts such as NAFTA.  While this may be true, Jose’s income – which is likely lower than Joe’s – is increased in Alex’s thought experiment.  But as one listens to Lou Dobbs – he does not consider Jose’s situation to be at all relevant.  This is where I part company with the Lou Dobbs Democrats.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/PC_Gats_Backgrounder_05-05.pdf">WTO GATS 2000</a> agreements are being implemented or pending that are defining water markets as we speak.  Any service can be made into a commodity, not only water.  Public Citizen presents <a href="http://www.citizen.org/trade/wto/gats/index.cfm">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At one time, trade rules were designed to enhance trade in goods and therefore focused on the lowering of tariff and quotas. But today&#8217;s &#8220;trade&#8221; agreements also seek to encourage international competition in a vast range of service sectors. The new trade agreements encompass &#8220;everything that you cannot drop on your foot,&#8221; and include banking, telecommunications, postal services, tourism, transportation, waste disposal, oil and gas production and electricity. They also cover those services universally considered to be essential to human health and development, like healthcare, education and drinking water. <br />In many countries, citizen access to essential services as well as a fundamental function of government is to ensure and protect this access. Traditionally, this has meant that governments have provided the services themselves. While we often don&#8217;t think of essential services as primarily profit-making operations, many essential services such as health care and schools have proved highly profitable when privatized and freed from public interest regulation. For corporations, health care and education represent a combined $5.5 trillion market worldwide, and the new trade agreements like the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the proposed <a href="http://www.citizen.org/trade/ftaa/index.cfm">Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA)</a> would increase their access to that market, without building in protections for consumers, workers or the environment.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/WTO_HongKong05_Factsheet2GATS%5B1%5D.pdf">Rules of the markets include the following</a>:</p>
<p>1)   There are only a few <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/Water/general/majorwater/">major companies</a> and they are international in scope. This affects   the goals of the suppliers as distinct from people who actually drink the water. <br />2) The agreements can open any national, state, or local government regulations to being overruled by appeal to a WTO tribunal.  It can also pre-determine the playing field by impeding domestic company advantage of being close to the source of supply.<br />3)  Lending organizations offer loans with harsh stipulations.  <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/Water/cmep_Water/wbimf/articles.cfm?ID=7807">IMF</a>, World Bank, and <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/Water/cmep_Water/reports/peru/index.cfm">IADP</a> and <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/Water/cmep_Water/wbimf/interamerica/">here</a> are lending with well-defined market objectives in mind that pre-determine how privatization is done in relation to international versus domestic companies. <br />4) <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/Water/activist/articles.cfm?ID=9590">Any regulation</a> government or private for quality is put in the hands of the WTO tribunal.  Hence the public regulatory mechanism for common good can be bypassed.  It strikes me that a domestic company can be overruled as well, if you posit a conscientious supplier who drinks the water and wants regulation.  Can you advertise that X company sells water that is dangerous?<br />5) Costs are to be charged in a pay-go manner instead of longer term financing that might be public or private that string out the initial costs over time.  Prices are dramatically affected with one or the other.  <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/Water/cmep_Water/wbimf/articles.cfm?ID=7807">Full cost recovery</a> affects public health negatively.<br />6) To date investment costs have not been to improve infrastructure, but more to maintain markets, implement management efficiencies, and increase profit margins at a cost to the consumer that appears to be short term, thus avoiding capitalization costs to improve the system.<br />7) It is possible that who gets to choose <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/Water/cmep_Water/wbimf/articles.cfm?ID=7807">the design and engineering consultants</a> work under WTO control, with not even the national government as a partner.</p>
<p>This defining of markets, occurring in supposed secret with access tending to be by leaks, seeks to define markets in a very non-competitive way, and to lessen any risk taking to minimum.  There are provisions that a company can raise prices solely due to devaluation of the national currency, without regard to actual on the ground expense.</p>
<p>Where is the invisible hand?  This does look like an invincible hand that is hard to think of as free in a good old fashion American way.  And what about national sovereignty?  All this stuff seems to turn things upside down in our own talk of markets, national interest, and the like.  </p>
<p>Where do I throw my <a href="http://www.citizen.org/trade/subfederal/">bricks</a> when accountability questions arise?</p>

                                <p>The Economic Times had the following <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Markets/Stocks/Global_Markets/China_raises_foreign-currency_reserves_ratio_to_5/articleshow/2020274.cms">story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>BEIJING: China’s central bank raised the amount of foreign currencies that lenders must keep as reserves, seeking to cool the world’s fastest-growing major economy.</p>
<p>Banks must keep 5% of their foreign-currency deposits as reserves starting May 15, up from 4%, according to a People’s Bank of China circular to lenders. The increase will remove about $1.7 billion from the economy. The decision will make less of the $165 billion of foreign-currency deposits as of March 31 available for lending and investment in the stock market, which surged to a record on Tuesday. It may also ease pressure for appreciation of the Chinese yuan, which has gained 7.5% since July 2005.</p>
<p>“The central bank probably wants to curb excess liquidity and indirectly ease the pressure on the yuan to rise,” said Guo Zhaoyang, a foreign-exchange analyst at China Everbright Bank in Guangzhou. “Too many people may have converted their foreign currencies blindly into the yuan.”</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>“The bigger news is what’s going on with the yuan, given they accelerated the pace of appreciation on Tuesday,” said Steve Rowles, an analyst with CFC Seymour in Hong Kong. “The story is inflation could be just coming into the China market and a stronger currency could help tackle that.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Lots of thoughts on this, but I will let others comment.</p>

                                <p>But Star Wars has not hit anything yet.</p>
<p>Today the editors of National Review Online say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Missile defense is one of the signal accomplishments of the Bush administration and the Republican Congress, beginning with the successful pullout from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 and continuing through the deployment of a handful of ABMs in 2004. Neither of these events led to the arms race or breakdown in international relations that critics had predicted. Today, the United States is safer because it isn’t constrained by an outdated agreement and finally possesses a limited defense against missile attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally after a hundred billion they have deployed missiles in Alaska and California which have never succeeded in getting through the entire set.</p>
<p>Just how limited is the Star Wars deployment?</p>
<p>Aiming is not hitting unless you are spending money which should not be spent.</p>
<p>Deploying untested stuff means scrap and rework in the future good work if the mean democrats do not get in the way and ask what can the thing hit?</p>
<p>And is there a threat out there that cannot be deterred or dealt with a bit less money.</p>
<p>The reason there is no arms race is two fold, one the rogue nations the new adversaries have no rockets to build, nor nuclear warheads, and two the guys who do  have the  weapons know Star Wars does not work.</p>
<p>Why race with fools?</p>

<blockquote><p>Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, is preparing to acknowledge that it should have known kickbacks were being paid to Saddam Hussein on oil it bought from Iraq as part of a defunct United Nations program, according to investigators.</p>
<p>The admission is part of a settlement being negotiated with United States prosecutors and includes fines totaling $25 million to $30 million, according to the investigators, who declined to be identified because the settlement was not yet public. </p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Using an elaborate system of secret surcharges and extra fees, however, the Iraqi regime received at least $1.8 billion in kickbacks from companies in the program, according to an investigation completed in 2005 by Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve. </p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the Volcker report, surcharges on Iraqi oil exports were introduced in August 2000 by the Iraqi state oil company, the State Oil Marketing Organization. At the time, <em><strong>Condoleezza Rice, now secretary of state, was a member of Chevron’s board and led its public policy committee, which oversaw areas of potential political concerns for the company</strong></em>. (emphasis placed by cactus)</p>
<p>Ms. Rice resigned from Chevron’s board on Jan. 16, 2001, after being named national security advisor by President Bush.</p>
<p>Sean McCormack, a State Department spokesman, referred inquires to Chevron.</p>
<p>According to Chevron’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, the public policy committee met three times in the course of 2000. Chevron declined to comment about the private deliberations of its board.</p></blockquote>
<p>No suprise.  Cheney&#8217;s Halliburton dealt with Iraq and Libya.  GW himself had ties to the Saudi and probably the Kuwaiti royal families as well.  We&#8217;re governed by people that like to deal with tyrants and dictators, and who never pay any price for it.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A reader sent me a link to a report by the Democratic Policy Committee entitled <a href="http://democrats.senate.gov/dpc/dpc-new.cfm?doc_name=fs-110-1-70">Middle-Class Life Under Bush: Less Affordable and Less Secure</a>.</p>
<p>The report notes the following (hopefully I got them all):</p>
<p>1. Health care premiums have increased by over 80 percent.<br />2. Gas prices have more than doubled. <br />3. College education costs have risen by 44 percent.<br />4. Housing affordability has reached a 15-year low.<br />5. While families work harder, their wages continue to decline.<br />6. Earnings for workers with college degrees declining.<br />7. Worst job creation record since Hoover Administration.<br />8. Unemployment has increased 7.1 percent and long-term joblessness has nearly doubled.<br />9. Bush’s deficit-financed tax cuts have widened the income gap between millionaires and middle-class workers.<br />10. More American families and children face severe financial problems.<br />11. Bush Republicans turned record budget surpluses into record deficits. <br />12. Bush Republicans, addicted to borrowing, increased the national debt by $3 trillion.<br />13. Enormous trade deficit is undermining U.S. competitiveness.<br />14. Debt owed to foreigners climbs to record levels. <br />15. Record government and personal debt levels threaten economic future.<br />16. Average student loan debt soars to more than $19,000.<br />17. Erosion of employer-provided pensions threatens Americans’ retirement security.</p>
<p>Now, its all heavily footnoted with sources, etc., and most of the sources seem to be pretty unbiased (i.e., US government) which is a good sign though I’ll admit I haven’t checked the numbers. </p>
<p>Some items on this list have both positives and negatives (lack of home affordability presumably means rising prices for home owners). Some are trends that started before GW (the trade deficit). But a lot of this is due to the Bush economy. </p>
<p>Consider the second item, gas prices. Remember the super secret Cheney energy task force? Well, at the very least its hard to see that much was done that would benefit the consumer of gasoline. And very little was done to help wean Americans off the product. </p>
<p>Consider health care costs… I had a few posts some months back showing that starting in the 1970s, health care costs rise a lot more under <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/healthcare-cost-increases-by-president.html">faster under Republican administrations</a> than Democratic administrations, and that they generally <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/public-healthcare-expenditures-and.html">rise more slowly the greater the government’s share of the healthcare dollar</a>.</p>
<p>Some problems belong unambiguously to GW and the Congress that enabled him thus far&#8230; the budget deficit, for example.</p>
<p>As to the rest&#8230; I am not one of the those that believe the President doesn&#8217;t affect the economy. Certainly GW and his supporters didn&#8217;t think that was the case in 2000 and 2004. And he&#8217;s claimed credit for job creation since 2003. Presumably he can claim credit for most of the items on this list.</p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>
