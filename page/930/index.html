                                <p>Cactus has started an interesting tradition – letting those who have different points of view than the ones often presented at Angrybear go beyond putting their views in the comment box and allowing a few to become guest posts.  AB reader <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/in-defense-of-social-security.html">M. Jed</a>, for example, argues for Social Security privatization:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me state up front that I am a proponent of Social Security privatization. My reasons vary, and in researching this, some were validated and others called into question but they included – (1) higher expected rates of return, (2) increased equity ownership and portfolio diversification for those at the lower end of wealth spectrum, and (3) a personal bias towards increased individual responsibility versus social responsibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m tempted to point out that <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006321">Gary Becker</a> and <a href="http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/barro/bw/bw00_07_03.pdf">Robert Barro</a> might agree with (3) but they have also argued that (1) and (2) are false.  I have tried to make the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/privatization-brad-plumer-joins-no.html">same point</a> numerous times. M. Jed actually makes this easy as he points us to <a href="http://www.bc.edu/centers/crr/papers/wp_2005-11.pdf">Top Ten Myths of Social Security Reform</a> by Jeffrey Brown, Kevin Hassett, and Kent Smetters:</p>
<blockquote><p>Myth 4 &#8230; This mathematic and economic reality has not stopped some proponents of personal accounts from arguing that there is a “free lunch” available, if only we would divert existing tax revenue into personal accounts. The idea behind this approach is that the higher rates of return that would be achieved by investing Social Security funds in the stock market (or other private investments) would allow us to deliver future benefits that are greater than or equal to the existing level of scheduled benefits without raising taxes … The only problem with this approach is a simple one – it is not true … The fallacy of this argument, which is nearly universally understood by academic economists of all political stripes, has been known for decades and is perhaps most clearly explained in work by Geanakoplos, Mitchell, and Zeldes … “Myth 5” below will address this issue more in-depth, but a problem with simple rate of return comparisons is that these analyses often fail to acknowledge that higher rates of return on stocks are simply the market’s compensation for risk.</p>
<p>Myth 5 &#8230; A leading selling point among advocates of personal accounts is that the rate of return that individuals can achieve through personal accounts is much greater than the return that is available through the existing Social Security system &#8230; It is certainly true that an individual (or, for that matter, a centralized fund) can earn an expected rate of return on private investments that is higher than the internal rate of return that the average worker can expect to receive from Social Security. It does not follow, however, that redirecting existing Social Security payroll tax revenue into private investments will necessarily increase the rate of return for participants. There are two basic reasons that this is so. First, when using existing Social Security revenue to finance the private investment, it is necessary to net out the expense of servicing the legacy costs of the system. As already discussed under Myth 4, unless policymakers decide that they will not honor the benefit obligations to current and future retirees, we still need to find the funds to pay those benefits. An accurate comparison of rates of return from Social Security contributions should account for these costs in both the current system and in a mixed system where part of the funds are redirected to personal accounts.  A second issue is that statements about higher rates of return need to be accompanied by appropriate caveats about risk. Basic finance theory teaches that higher expected returns are the reward for bearing increased risk. For example, stocks have a higher expected return than bonds because stocks are riskier than bonds, i.e., stocks will outperform bonds on average, but also carry with them an increased probability of “extreme” outcomes (e.g., experiencing very high, or very low, even negative, returns). This must be true in a market equilibrium as long as investors like high returns and dislike risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – the privatization crowd loves to lecture us that stocks pay a higher expected return than bonds, but then the same households they would transfer the Social Security Trust Fund bonds too likely know this as they also recognize the risks from holding bonds.  Now perhaps M. Jed thinks these households are irrationally risk averse, while Barro and Becker would view their risk aversion as rational.  But it makes no difference as to who is correct as these households would take these bonds and invest them in guess what – government bonds.  Which means there would be no change in either risk taking or expected returns.  I’m truly amazed how many times we hear this free lunch argument given the simple financial economists put forth by Gary Becker, Robert Barro, and many others – which appeared in that 1998 paper by Geanakoplos, Mitchell, and Zeldes.</p>

                                <p>Thankfully, the Hastert led Congress will not be in power after this year so that it cannot do more of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/12/08/congress.roundup.ap/index.html">this</a>: <br />
<blockquote>In its last hours of GOP control, Congress passed a raft of bills big and small, most significantly a sweeping bill reviving expired tax breaks, extending trade benefits for developing countries and protecting doctors from a big cut in Medicare payments.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CNN headline says Congress finished with a flourish.  Pretending to cut taxes as Congress insures its increases in entitlement will be large.  Pathetic or just for the course?  There may be a few fiscal conservatives in the Congress but the story notes:<br />
<blockquote>The legislation was bundled and sent to the Senate for a single vote, and its popularity easily vanquished a handful of GOP opponents. Republican budget hawks bridled at the measure&#8217;s cost, and textile state senators objected to trade provisions benefiting Haiti. The sweeping votes reflected widespread bipartisan support for extending expired tax breaks, including the research and development tax credit for businesses, sales tax deductions for people in states without income taxes, the tax deduction on college tuition, a tax credit for hiring welfare recipients and others facing difficulties finding jobs, tax credits for alternative energy producers and purchases of solar energy equipment by homeowners and businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, free lunch fiscal policy is popular and there aren’t enough leaders in the Democratic Party who are willing to say no.  I hope this changes when Nancy Pelosi becomes the Speaker because I see this as an opportunity:<br />
<blockquote>But Republicans dumped an unfinished budget on the Democrats about to take power, with the Senate barely meeting a midnight deadline to pass a stopgap spending bill putting the government on autopilot until February 15. The failure to pass budget bills for domestic agencies, said Rep. David Obey, D-Wisconsin, amounted to &#8220;a blatant admission of abject failure by the most useless Congress in modern times.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Irresponsible?  Yes.  But now that the Democrats are about to gain control of Congress, my hope is that Speaker Pelosi sits down with the true fiscal conservatives in the GOP and the Blue Dog Democrats to figure out where some of the pork can be sliced out of these bills.</p>

                                <p>This one is by reader M. Jed.  You might remember that last month, M. Jed had a post on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/m-jeds-post-on-demographics-and-tax.html">how demographics affect tax collections</a>.  Here&#8217;s M. Jed:</p>
<p>Let me state up front that I am a proponent of Social Security privatization.  My reasons vary, and in researching this, some were validated and others called into question but they included – (1) higher expected rates of return, (2) increased equity ownership and portfolio diversification for those at the lower end of wealth spectrum, and (3) a personal bias towards increased individual responsibility versus social responsibility.  Solvency is not and has never been one of my reasons.  Frequent commenter Bruce Webb, persistently asks privatization proponents to backup their ideology with numbers and what follows is my attempt.  </p>
<p>For those, including myself, that recognize Social Security as a combination of retirement savings and disability insurance, fortunately the SS Administration breaks out the components of the contribution rates.  The Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) (original design of the program) component of the contribution rate is <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/t2a3.pdf">5.3% for each employee and employer.</a>  Using the <a href="http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/hhinc/new02_001.htm">Consumer Population Survey’s Income Statistics</a>, I recreated a life-cycle household earnings chronology, for the median household, which based on my estimates starts at $30,000 at age 22 (median for 15-24 year olds is $28,770) and peaks at $64,000 at age 45, before starting to decline again. The real IRR of SS for the post baby-boom generation is estimated at<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v62n2/v62n2p43.pdf"> about 1.8%.</a>  With the contribution rate, estimated household incomes, and the IRR, it’s possible to estimate the projected real account value at retirement (I used age 65).  For this hypothetical median family, they contribute $247,000 over the course of their career(s) and have a real account value at retirement of $370,000.  As I understand the cited source, the 1.8% real IRR only incorporates the OASI component of SS so it is apples-to-apples for the 10.6% employer/employee combined contribution.  </p>
<p>Now, most people (even Bruce) acknowledge if one were to have instead invested prior contributions and received the historical equity rates of return, the Social Security account values would be substantially higher.   What Bruce doggedly questions is why people assume that historical equity returns are likely to persist in an environment where the required assumption (i.e., that SS faces problems) is that productivity growth will be lower than history.  I make no such assumption, however, in researching this post I found that the primary reason OASI has a lower IRR than government bonds is because of the net wealth transfer that benefited initial recipients in a pay-as-you-go pension scheme, since they made no contributions.  This wealth transfer needs to be taken into account when projecting rates of return and is estimated as a reduction of 25% of contributions.  Note that grossing up the 1.8% IRR for this 25% reduction, is 2.4%, or about the historical real return on government bonds, and slightly better than current long-dated TIPS yields.  </p>
<p>So let’s move to equities.  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/"> There </a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">exist</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/"></a>>multiple <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">sources</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">that</a> note that historical rates of return on equities are not the correct benchmark, but rather they seem to center on an expected forward real U.S. equity return of<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/"> 4.5%.</a>  I’ve been unable to find projections for foreign equities, but I recognize arguments for either greater or lesser expected returns relative to U.S. markets and also the political firestorm that recommending investing Social Security contributions in non-U.S. based companies would create and thereby default to the 4.5% for the entire equities component.  Using a real rate of equity returns of 4.5%, an assumption of an administration fee on equities of 0.25%, and a 25% reduction in the rate to pay for historical wealth transfer produces an effective expected total return on equities of 3.2%.  If one were to allocate 50/50, the effective expected SS rate would be 2.5% compared to today’s 1.8%.  Over the course of a median career, this results in an expected portfolio at retirement that is 22% higher than the status quo and if one were to allocate 75% to equities it would be 33% higher.  </p>
<p>The post-retirement OASI annuity component must also be taken into account, but I’d note that there currently exist a plethora of private products with income-for-life for both the purchaser and spouse that have both market exposure and guaranteed returns.  Analyzing these would necessitate a much longer post.</p>
<p>In conclusion, (1) private accounts would produce higher expected at-retirement account values, though nowhere near as high as most proponents suggest and (2) the “free lunch” comes from increased diversification for those who have traditionally not invested in equities, which I personally assume is because most of their savings has gone to Social Security.  Finally, by far the best and most balanced summary of SS issues I found was <a href="http://www.bc.edu/crr/papers/wp_2005-11.pdf"> here</a> which addresses the top 10 myths of SS reform perpetuated by both the left and the right, many of which have been discussed at AngryBear.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve stated my views of the two main political parties before&#8230; its my opinion that at this point in time (at least since 1994, if not 1980), the Democrats are less obnoxious than the Republicans.  I&#8217;m hopeful the Democrats are going to clean up Washington, but I&#8217;m not exactly willing to bet on it.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_12/010363.php">Kevin Drum </a> links to an article providing some indication that the incoming Democrats are as willing to embrace complete ignorance on important subjects, and elevate the completely ignorant to leadership positions, as the outgoing Republicans.  </p>
<p>You can&#8217;t win a war if you don&#8217;t have a clue who you&#8217;re fighting, and you can&#8217;t win it if you aren&#8217;t fighting the people who are fighting you.</p>
<p>Let me close this post by stating&#8230; the hell with all these people who don&#8217;t have the decency to step aside when their ignorance costs lives.  I hope they rot.  And I hope the same for those who enable them.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This one is by Steven Kyle:</p>
<p>It was reported yesterday (See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/08/world/africa/08worldbank.html">here</a>) that the World Bank’s work in rural Africa has not yielded good results.  This is a bit misleading – Though I wouldn’t want to disagree with this statement, it would be more accurate to say that the World Bank hasn’t generated much in the way of results in rural Africa because the World Bank has retreated from any major effort to achieve those results in recent years.  </p>
<p>A quick look at the Bank’s own website reveals that out of 251 loans and credits to date in 2006 only 24 were for the purpose of Agriculture and Rural Development.  Of these 24 only 11 were for countries in Sub Saharan Africa.  Even granting that this figure only represents projects initiated in 2006 it is still obvious that rural development is not a primary focus of World Bank lending.  Rather, as stated in the article, emphasis has been more on education and combating corruption.</p>
<p>These are certainly worthy goals – but the Bank’s retreat from agriculture over the past decade or so is the result of several different forces – one is the dismal performance of many rural development efforts in the past but another is simply the fact that rural development is difficult and time-consuming so that even if there are positive results they aren’t seen within the 5-7 year span of most projects. Another factor which is not so fashionable to point out is that there are quite a few Sub Saharan African countries where growth in agriculture is never going to be all that great because the countries involved are located in deserts where it seldom rains and soils are poor.  Yet another is the fact that agricultural development, unlike some other activities with more of a public good nature, is not best done by bureaucrats in capital cities.  (Just look at the disaster the centrally planned economies made of agriculture – The World Bank is not alone in this problem)</p>
<p>The World Bank is as prone to fads and cycles as any other organization.  The problem with relegating rural development to a second tier status is that in many parts of the world that’s where most of the poor people are.  Depending on whether you believe the World Bank is a useful participant in trying to promote rural development, we should hope that agriculture will be the target of renewed interest in the future.</p>

                                <p>In the comments to Steve Kyle&#8217;s post on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/economic-literacy-of-teenagers-by.html">economic literacy of college students</a>, Tom DC/VA mentions a hypothetical economic literacy course for high school students.</p>
<p>What would such a class entail?  If you read this blog, you shouldn&#8217;t be surprised I think it should make students familiar with the magnitude of numbers.  Of course, nobody can visualize a 12 trillion dollar GDP &#8211; they can, however, visualize real GDP per capita.  Same with debt, etc.  </p>
<p>Another thing&#8230;  students have to be taught empathy, and I don&#8217;t mean it in the bleeding heart liberal sense.  Consider&#8230; I taught for a while at an MBA program whose students are often quite wealthy.  (One professor has joked that the school has the GDP of Austria.)  I found many concepts were alien to them.  For instance, nobody could understand discouraged workers &#8211; why would people voluntarilly choose to be unemployed?  So I had an exercise&#8230; I would pick a small town in the middle of nowhere.  We would talk about life in the town &#8211; how it has only one big employer, perhaps a saw mill or whatnot.   I would then ask &#8211; what happens if that saw mill closes?</p>
<p>Well, the response was&#8230; &#8220;find another job.&#8221;  Ah&#8230; but you and 200 other people are searching&#8230;  what other job?  <br />The next response was &#8220;Leave. Move to Chicago or whatever happens to be the nearest big city.&#8221;  But&#8230;  how much can you get for your four bedroom home in the small town, especially now that the saw mill closed down?  And how much is a home in Chicago?  You, your spouse, and your three kids have to live somewhere.  And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I think teaching kids to put themselves into other people&#8217;s shoes and think things through to their logical conclusion has a lot of value.</p>
<p>What about you?  What do you think should be in the course that Tom DC/VA mentions?</p>

                                <p>In comments to PGL&#8217;s post, <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/116563664342477890/#574360">Greg Mankiw writes</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were auditioning for the National Review, do you think I would be using my blog to advocate an increase in gasoline taxes?&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of you may remember my post on Arnold Harberger a few weeks back.  Now, I was reminded of Harberger again when I read Mankiw&#8217;s comment.  If it wasn&#8217;t clear from my previous post, I think Harberger is brilliant.  He simplifies amazingly well, cutting right down to the bone but no farther.  Its milimetric precision, and he does it very quickly.  But one thing that is clear to anyone who knows who Harberger is &#8211; nobody sane, not even a Pinochet, would ever confuse him with a liberal.</p>
<p>And yet&#8230; unless I&#8217;m hallucinating, I remember Harberger saying in class that the thought there should be a large tax on gasoline.  I think he specifically mentioned an additional $3 per gallon.  In fact, I remember arguing with him about it both during and after class.  For context, this would have been about 1992 or 1993.  And I remember having the same discussion with him in his office a couple of years later &#8211; probably around 1995. </p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not about to say that a tax on gasoline is a popular position among conservatives, or even among conservatives who know their economics.  But, here is an example of two economists, both of whom are at least very, very good (even if I personally think one made the decision to become a hack &#8211; and I&#8217;m not talking about Harberger) who support a specific tax.  And it is a tax that many liberals might not support.  I personally would support a higher tax on gasoline&#8230; $3 a gallon (in 1993 dollars) higher, well, I&#8217;m not sure.  I&#8217;ve never run any numbers.   </p>
<p>So what gives?</p>

<p>What motivated <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/12/wage-growth.html">Greg Mankiw</a> to write this comment:<br />
<blockquote>The average hourly wage for workers below management level &#8211; everyone from school bus drivers to stockbrokers &#8211; rose 2.8 percent from October 2005 to October of this year, after being adjusted for inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, Greg is quoting a NYTimes that we discussed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/november-employment-report.html">this morning</a> and yes it is technically true &#8211; if one does not consider the latest news from the BLS that nominal wage growth was only 2% on an annualized basis last month.  We’ll have to wait to see how much the CPI rose.  If real wages dip even by the slightest amount, then real wage growth from November 2003 to November 2006 will have been ZERO.  Not exactly commensurate with the real wage growth during the 1997 to 2001 period.  This is rather obvious to anyone who understands the facts – and I’m sure that Greg Mankiw does as well as anyone.  So why does he continue to write Karl Rove approved spin?  I hope Harvard is compensating him enough that he does not need income from the National Review crowd.</p>

                                <p>Steven Kyle really took me seriously when I offered to post stuff by Angry Bear readers.  M. Jed also had a write-up, as did Alex Gorski.  Where are the rest of you?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Steven Kyle&#8217;s latest.  I suspect some parts of this will look very familiar to those of you have had the opportunity to teach econ in the past few years:</p>
<p>Economic “Literacy” of Teenagers </p>
<p>I teach a large course in principles of economics  and often do informal surveys of student opinion to see what sort of notions they arrive with.  I guess I have two thoughts – one of them is to find out what the Future of Our Civilization will be like since these kids will be running the show when I am retired and the other is to find out what economic ideas are written on the tabula rasa of the 18 year old mind.  Most of them have no previous economics training and are largely telling me what they learned as conventional wisdom at dinner table conversations.  I think it is revealing of what their personal experience has been – Even the most aware don’t remember much before around 2000.  By far the majority of the students are not future Econ majors.  They take the course to fulfill core requirements for their majors but most aren’t going to go much further than Econ 102.</p>
<p>– Here is a not necessarily exhaustive list of some observations:</p>
<p>1.  They don’t see the problem with deficits or the national debt.  It hasn’t been a problem yet, it is boring and probably most important, they themselves live on credit cards and have happy lives so why shouldn’t the country?</p>
<p>2.  Inflation is a completely alien thought to them.  We economists are totally convinced of the importance of compound growth rates and what the price index has done over the past few decades but today’s college students (unless they are from Argentina or some other place where inflation is an issue) simply have no experience of it.  Prices haven’t gone up more than 2 or 3% a year in their lifetimes so they completely glaze over at being told how important it is to avoid it.</p>
<p>3.  They are convinced that Social Security is doomed and there is no way it will be there for them.  Many cite the much quoted factoid that the number of workers per retiree is declining.  Given these opinions they are mostly in favor of revamping the program since they see it as a tax with no future benefit.</p>
<p>4.  International trade is viewed with suspicion.  I can make them look at the labels on their clothes all day to demonstrate how important imports are to them and they will still worry about shipping jobs overseas and/or environmental issues.  Of course, since I teach them that international trade always has both winners and losers and truth lies in the data maybe I am at fault here.  Next time I do the course I think I will ask them if they would be willing to pay 5% more for their clothes if that meant more jobs here in the US.  I bet they would do it even if the sum total of the losses far outweighed the gains.</p>
<p>5.  There are no Luddites that I can find.  Technological change is taken for granted.  In fact, it is embraced fervently by all.  Today’s college students seem more interested in finding a job making new technologies than worrying about losing jobs because of it.</p>
<p>6.  Environmental awareness seems universal.  All are against pollution but there is no consensus on what to do about it and no real awareness of, or support for such economistic solutions as tradable permits.</p>
<p>So there you have it.  I suspect this is a fairly reasonable barometer of what opinion is among the population a whole or at least among those who are more or less aware but aren’t economists.  Comments?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The latest from the BLS can be found <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">here</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 132,000 in November, and the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged at 4.5 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics  of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Job gains continued in several service-providing industries, including professional and business services, food services, and health care.  Employment declined in construction and manufacturing.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, some sectors suffered job losses but overall employment rose by a decent amount. The reported unemployment rate, which had declined from 4.6% in September to 4.4% in October inched back up to 4.5%.  This increase was not due to fall in the employment to population ratio, which stayed at 63.3% as the Household Survey recorded an increase of 277,000 (can’t wait for Lawrence Kudlow to tell us about all of those self-employed folks).  It seems the civilian labor force rose by 383,000 so the labor force participation rate rose from 66.2% to 66.3%.</p>
<p>On the wage front, nominal wages rose from $16.91 to $16.94 last month. Whether this modest increase will keep pace with the rise in consumer prices is not clear as the BLS will release the CPI later.  Speaking of which <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/08/business/08wage.html?ei=5094&#038;en=a06bab73a4abd4d6&#038;hp=&#038;ex=1165640400&#038;partner=homepage&#038;pagewanted=all">Jeremy Peters and David Leonhardt</a> write:<br />
<blockquote>After four years in which pay failed to keep pace with price increases, wages for most American workers have begun rising significantly faster than inflation &#8230; After years of stagnant, even declining real wages for the typical worker, the recent jump has also delivered a rare bit of good news for a White House coping with an unpopular war and the aftermath of the Democratic victory in the midterm elections &#8230; That question will begin to be answered today when the Labor Department releases its monthly employment report. Forecasters expect the pay gains — which began in earnest in September, when gas prices sank — to extend into November. But the economy has slowed significantly in recent months, and some analysts predict the housing slump will cause a further slowdown next year that will be a drag on incomes.  “The biggest issue is which direction the macroeconomy is headed,” said Jason Furman</p></blockquote>
<p>So far, Jeremy and David have written a good article.  So what got <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_12/010355.php">Kevin Drum</a> up on the wrong side of the bed so early on the West Coast:<br />
<blockquote>Boy, I sure hope the Fed doesn&#8217;t do anything to put the kibosh on this. Workers could use a break. But I&#8217;m sure Ben Bernanke realizes&#8230;.um, realizes that — what? He said what? &#8230; Ah yes. &#8220;Labor costs.&#8221; We can&#8217;t have those rising, can we? Not only does it get the workers all uppity, but it drains corporate treasuries and puts a crimp in CEO pay increases. That would be a disaster.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Chairman Ben thinks the labor market is overheated, I respectfully disagree.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/12/real_wages_are_rising_but_lets.html#014755">Dean Baker</a> objects to portions of the NYT article:<br />
<blockquote>The use of “significantly” in this sentence can be disputed. It is true that real wages have been rising rapidly in the last few months, but this is because of the plunge in gas prices, that was clearly a one-time event (as later acknowledged in the article). The reality is that nominal wages are rising in a neighborhood of 3.9 percent to 4.0 percent, while the underlying rate of inflation is in the range of 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent, translating into real wage growth of between 0.9 percent and 1.5 percent. This is a decent rate of real wage growth, but certainly not extraordinary. Average hourly wages grew at a real annual rate of 1.5 percent from the beginning of 1996 to 2000. From 1964 to 1973 real wage growth averaged more than 1.6 percent. So, the current rate of wage growth is respectable, but not extraordinary, especially following almost 5 years of wage stagnation. These points are noted in the article, but the article also features Ed Lazear, President Bush’s chief economist, saying that “the pay increases are huge, even relative to a period we think of as good.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone in the White House hyping the little morsels of good news?  Unheard of!  Deano also critiques Chairman Ben’s fear of rising wages.</p>
