<blockquote>In the 1970&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s, conservatives felt the primary threat was the overweening nanny state. Ronald Reagan tried to loosen the structures that restricted individual initiative and led to national sclerosis. He and Margaret Thatcher deregulated, privatized, cut tax rates in order to liberate entrepreneurs. The dominant formula was simple: less government equals more freedom. &#8220;Government is the problem,&#8221; Reagan declared, expressing the organizing conservative principle of the day. Times change. Now the chief problem is not sclerosis but disorder. The biggest threats come not from nanny states but from failed states and rogue states. There is less popular fear of bureaucrats possessing too much control than of ungoverned forces surging out of control: immigration, the federal debt, Iraqi sectarianism, Islamic radicalism, Chinese mercantilism, domestic rage and polarization.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/content/view/127505/86">Brad Setser</a> quips:<br />
<blockquote>Not quite sure the federal debt is an &#8220;ungoverned force&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Neither am I.  I guess Mr. Brooks is too young to realize (or is it too dishonest to admit) that President Reagan’s tax cuts did not reduce the size of the government but did increase the Federal debt massively.  George W. Bush CHOOSE to follow Reagan’s lead into a policy that would eventually lead to Federal bankruptcy if no future political leader had the courage to change course.  We know President Clinton did have the courage to govern.  Maybe what Mr. Brooks meant is that this current crop of Republican politicians fails to possess any governing force in the sense of being leaders with the courage to tell voters the truth.  If so, I would hope Mr. Brooks cease making excuses for them and demands those that do.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/05/what_supplyside.html">Mark Thoma</a> points to a couple of pieces from <a href="http://robertreich.blogspot.com/2006/05/supply-side-crapola.html">Robert</a> <a href="http://robertreich.blogspot.com/2006/05/tax-obscenity.html">Reich</a>, which I want to discuss in a bit.  Mark leads with some nonsense from <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20060511-082817-6022r.htm">R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr.</a>:<br />
<blockquote>There is a bigotry against the term Supply-Side Economics. That is the only way to explain it. The prejudices of those who for decades have believed what is best for society is a government that taxed and spent restrain them from reviewing the mounting evidence to the contrary.  Prejudice and bigotry are not all that unusual in the human condition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me suggest that my fellow ‘bigot’ &#8211; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/14/AR2006051400806.html">Sebastian Mallaby</a> &#8211; is not prejudiced at all.  We just recognize BS when we see it.  I don’t believe in the tooth fairy either so does that make me a homophobe?</p>
<p>Mr. Tyrrell’s playing of the race card does not excuse the stupidity of those who pretend there is a free lunch as in the following garbage from <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/blog/2006/05/pining_for_higher_tax_rates.html">John McIntyre</a>: <br />
<blockquote>The Return of Voodoo Economics makes one wonder about what he doesn&#8217;t like about 4% growth, under 5% unemployment, housing and the stock market higher, wealth being created and tax revenues at all time highs. I guess he pines for the pre-Voodoo Economics days of the 1970&#8217;s when the highest marginal tax rate was 70% and the country had anemic growth, high unemployment and a Dow languishing below 1,000.  What gives Mallaby the right to think that he is a &#8220;serious&#8221; person when it comes to economic policy, but President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Majority Leader Frist and Finance Chairmen Grassley are not? Is Mallaby really that arrogant? Did it ever occur to Sebastian that maybe he is letting his ideological views get in the way of an honest appraisal of the facts? Why is it so hard to explain the concept to many &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; that the idea is to grow the pie as big as possible, and that taking a smaller percentage of a bigger pie can yield more than a higher percentage of a smaller pie? Mallaby can quote all the economists and studies he wants to justify his attack on the economic wisdom of lower tax rates.  I&#8217;ll just look at what happens in the real world. </p></blockquote>
<p>As McIntyre advocates an “honest appraisal of the facts” – maybe he should recognize that the government slice of the pie (government purchases relative to GDP) did not fall during President Reagan’ tenure as President and has actually increased a bit under President George W. Bush.  Maybe he should also recognized that the increase in consumption after the 1981 and 2001 tax cuts led to less national savings.  Real GDP growth during the Reagan-Bush41 era was only 3.0% and will likely be less than 3% during the first decade of the 21st century.  So when he claims that growth has increased as a result of the tax cuts – he has his facts wrong.  </p>
<p>But look – beating up on these free lunch supply-side midgets is all too easy even if there seems to be an endless supply of such ill informed rightwingers.  My main complaint is with my fellow liberal Robert Reich as he takes on well known supply-side liar Lawrence Kudlow:<br />
<blockquote>Larry is a card-carrying unrepentant supply-sider who still believes low taxes lead to faster economic growth, which trickles down to everyone. Unfortunately for Larry, supply-side economics is one of those rare economic theories to have been tried in practice (the Reagan administration was the last full-fledged experiment) and failed miserably. By the end of the Reagan years, the federal budget deficit had ballooned and the only thing that trickled down was debt. The first George Bush was forced, finally, to raise taxes (despite what people may have read on his lips) because the bond markets were in full-scale revolt.</p></blockquote>
<p>What missing here folks?  Or here:<br />
<blockquote>I’d appreciate it if someone could explain to me why we need another tax cut for high-income Americans especially when the gap between the rich and poor, and between every rung on the income ladder, is wider than it’s been in almost a century. Some administration apologists, including the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, claim repeatedly that the rich are paying a larger-than-ever share of income taxes, so it’s entirely fitting that they get the lion’s share of any tax cut.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t get me wrong – Robert Reich does this debate a great service when he talks about income distribution even if we can hear Robert Novak screaming something about CLASS WARFARE in the background.  But he almost concedes Kudlow’s usual argument about faster growth by default even if we know Kudlow is dead wrong. Let me share my initial reaction to the two pieces by Reich that Mark Thoma linked to:<br />
<blockquote>I like Reich &#8211; but let&#8217;s be honest. He&#8217;s not all that effective in debating this issue. All one needs to do to undermine the Kudlow et al. faster growth argument is to quote a Kudlow statistics &#8211; the US economy&#8217;s average annual growth rate from 1947 to 2000 has been 3.5%. But let&#8217;s break this down:<br />1947-1980 (high tax rates): 3.5%<br />1981-1992 (low tax rates): 3.0%<br />1993-2000 (high tax rates): 3.7%<br />Now taking the OMB projections for the rest of this decade, we project the following:<br />2001-2010 (low tax rates): 2.9%</p></blockquote>
<p>I know – nothing original nor really all that complicated.  But we have been witnessing a flood of free lunch garbage of late – all wrapped in a slew of distortions that Kudlow and his fellow clowns are infamous for bringing to any discussion.  </p>
<p>As my initials indicate – I am a ProGrowth Liberal so if there is some means for increasing growth without the adverse distributional consequences that Robert Reich is rightfully concerned with, GREAT.  Kudlow and his clowns want you to believe it is as easy as cutting taxes never reminding folks that unless we cut government spending somewhere, the reduction in national savings will mean less growth, which is the point noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/dynamic-scoring-brad-delong-has-read.html">here</a>.  Conservative economists, which excludes Kudlow and his clowns, can put forth their pro-growth small government proposals with a straight face as incentives do matter as long as we actually take the steps to insure fiscal neutrality.  </p>
<p>But conservative politicians such as George W. Bush and Newt Gingrich don’t wish to engage liberals like Robert Reich in a debate over real choices.  So they send out their fake economists, which includes Kudlow and his clowns, to lie to the public.  My advice to Robert Reich and others is to start the debate with a few simple facts – that being that growth slowed down during the Reagan-Bush41 low tax era, was faster during the Clinton high tax era, and slowed down again during the Bush43 era.  </p>
<p>When dealing with Kudlow and his clowns – the old adage applies: Keep It Simple, Stupid.  <a href="http://matthewyglesias.tpmcafe.com/node/29879">Matthew Yglesias</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_05/008817.php">Kevin Drum</a> show us how.</p>

It should read, &#8220;The feedback is surprisingly large: in the long run, provided spending is cut to keep the government budget in balance, for standard parameter values, half of a capital tax cut is self-financing.&#8221; In Mankiw-Weinzerl&#8217;s model, you have to cut spending by almost all of the static revenue loss in the short run, and by half of the static revenue loss in the long run. That&#8217;s not Bush tax policy. Bush tax policy is to cut taxes and boost spending. &#8220;[H]alf of a capital tax cut is self-financing&#8221; implies that Mankiw-Weinzerl&#8217;s results are relevant to the capital tax cut bill moving through the system right now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad also asks us to read <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w12103">Eric M. Leeper and Shu-Chun Susan Yang</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Neoclassical growth models predict positive growth effects over the entire transition path following a reduction in capital or labor tax rates when lump-sum taxes (or transfers) are used to balance the government budget. This paper considers the consequences of bond-financed tax reductions that bring forth adjustments in expected future government consumption, capital tax rates, or labor tax rates. Through the resulting intertemporal distortions, current tax cuts can lower growth. The paper shows that the stronger the response of distorting fiscal policies to debt, the more favorable the growth effects of a tax cut.</p></blockquote>
<p>Had President Bush decided to actually reduce government spending as he pretended to “give us our money back”, the recent supply-side chanting could rely upon the Mankiw-Weinzierl model to suggest that higher savings would eventually lead to significant output gains.  The problem, however, is that the current crop of supply-siders are very much like the supply-siders during Reagan’s term in that they pretend there are free lunches.  As in the 1980’s, the tax cuts have LOWERED national savings.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.aei.org/events/eventID.1338,filter.all/event_detail.asp">Karl Rove</a> gave a “Policy Address” at the American Economic Institute and <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjE3NmZjY2JiNTc2MzQ5MDFkMmQ0NzRlOTAwNWQ0YjI=">JPod</a> provides a partial transcript:<br />
<blockquote>And we&#8217;re going to be fine because we stand for things that are important. We stand for strong natural defense abroad and complete victory in the war on terrorism which involves victory in Iraq. &#8220;We stand for a strong national defense. We stand for economic policies that are pro-growth, involving tax cuts and free trade. We are strongly for fiscal restraint in the budget process. &#8220;And our opponents, at this point, stand for little or nothing, except mere obstructionism.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Natural defense abroad</strong>?  Excuse me Karl – but we Democrats stand for a strong national defense and the protection of our environment at home.  But OK, he misspoke.  George Bush is neither for fiscal restraint nor free trade judging from his first five years in office – so stop pretending.</p>

<blockquote>Seeking to shift blame away from the Federal Reserve and the Nixon White House for the oil shocks of the early 1970s, the late Herbert Stein said, “My devotion to the old-time religion is not so great as to make me believe that M1 or the full-employment budget deficit determines the amount of rainfall in the Russian wheat lands, the location of Peruvian anchovies or the decisions of the oil cartel.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I wish he would have skipped the “seeking to shift blame away from the Federal Reserve and the Nixon White House for the oil shocks of the early 1970s” nonsense AS WELL AS THE REST OF THIS OP-ED.  As usual Tamny confuses nominal prices with relative prices.  The variability of the relative price of oil prices has little to do with U.S. monetary policy.  Herbert Stein understood this simple point – but also John Tamny does not.</p>

                                <p>On <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12739318">Meet the Press</a>, Gingrich said Republicans and Democrats need to have a bipartisan dialogue but he also said:<br />
<blockquote>if you represent a party whose contract is with San Francisco and Vermont, you can hardly explain what your future is. I mean, Congresswoman Pelosi cannot explain what her speakership would be because it would be so far to the left they would guarantee the Republicans re-election. So I was saying partly they can’t possibly put together a contract with America because Howard Dean and Nancy Pelosi and, and, and their allies are so far to the left. They can’t be clear what they would do—raise taxes, create more big bureaucracy, have a much weaker system of defending America &#8230; The country would love for Republicans to be solid on this, the country does not want to go back to a left-wing Democratic majority</p></blockquote>
<p>We love you too, Newt.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/05/14/beheading">Roger Ailes</a> catches Newt&#8217;s bloviation, which included a defense of the warrantless wiretapping program as being totally legal.  Newt suggested he was never unfair to Speaker Jim Wright as Newt denied that he personally ever had ethical lapses.  And listening to his neocon nonsense, I suspect <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/since-iraq-went-so-well-lets-do-it.html">this post</a> applied to Newt as well.  But the real howlers came when Newt talked about fiscal policy and economics.  </p>
<p>He wanted to claim that the deficit fell during the 1990’s mainly because his leadership reduced domestic spending dramatically.  Never mind the fact that only defense spending fell as a share of GDP in any appreciable way.  Newt even tried to suggest that the “starve the beast” hypothesis works.</p>
<p>Newt failed to mention the increase in taxes as a share of GDP was the main reason for the improvement in the fiscal situation during Clinton’s tenure as all Newt wanted to do is to take credit for the first tax cut in 17 years.  </p>
<p>Newt wanted to make those bogus free lunch supply side claims that the Reagan and Bush tax cuts led to more growth – not less.  I guess he could not admit that the 1990’s boom followed the 1993 tax increase – the one he opposed and the real reason that the deficit fell.  As <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/14/AR2006051400806.html">Sebastian Mallaby</a> suggests &#8211; we are witnessing the <strong>Return of Voodoo Economics</strong>.</p>
<p>I would love to see an honest, bipartisan dialogue of the policy issues.  But please don’t invite serial liars like Newt Gingrich – especially if their favorite stooge (Tim Russert) moderates.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NTNkZmE0ZDM5YTUyMzE2NGZlMjNkOTJlZDg0ODgwNTI=">Deroy Murdock</a> of the National Review gets something right!<br />
<blockquote>On spending, LBJ’s Great Society seems greater than ever. Washington Republicans’ Spend-O-Rama famously included 13,997 pork-barrel projects that lodged like baby-back ribs in last year’s appropriations bills. President Bush’s $92.2 billion request for Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina funding has expanded to $109 billion after Senate manhandling. It now features such germane adornments as $6 million for Hawaiian sugar growers and $1.1 billion for private fisheries. Another $700 million would redirect train tracks that CSX Corp. invested $250 million to rebuild after Katrina; a replacement roadway then would link condos to Mississippi casinos.</p></blockquote>
<p>Check out Murdock’s graph showing Federal spending as a share of GDP from 1993 to today, which shows this ratio declining throughout the Clinton years but rising ever since.  </p>
<p>Under LBJ, we saw the 1964 tax cut, an increase in entitlement spending, and increased defense spending for the Vietnam War.  Under George W. Bush, we’ve had tax cuts, the prescription drug benefit, and yes, the Iraq War.  There may be one BIG difference, however.  As early as December 1965, the LBJ Council of Economic Advisors (you know – those KEYNESIANS) were warning the President that fiscal policy had become too stimulative and that unless he either cut spending or raised taxes, the FED would either have to increase interest rates (which they did for a while in 1966) or watch inflation accelerate.</p>
<p>I would hope Bush’s CEA is telling him the exact same time.  I would hope the CEA is saying words like “crowding-out” like the LBJ CEA were doing some 40 years ago.  LBJ did not like the message but he went to Wilbur Mills and suggested a tax increase.  But some supply-side goofball named Norman Ture told the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee back in 1966 that LBJ’s economists had no clue.  But we know these Keynesian economists were right.  </p>
<p>The difference between 1966 and 2006 is this – the supply-side goofball this time around happens to be the President.  Thank goodness, the FED is not buying the free lunch garbage of those who worship Norman Ture.  Alas, the interest rates will cause crowding-out of investment and less long-term growth.  I just hope Mr. Murdock can get this message to those supply-side goofballs at the National Review.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: While I’m praising NRO stuff, let me say yes sort of to what <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZDdiM2RlOTJmNzE4NWUwNjRmMDM5MTIyMWU3NGJiMmE=">Ramesh Ponnuru</a> said on the progressivity debate:<br />
<blockquote>The income tax has gotten more progressive, but not necessarily the &#8220;tax system&#8221; generally. Since income taxes are more progressive than payroll taxes, cutting income taxes but not payroll taxes makes the system as a whole less progressive. This observation is usually made by people who aren&#8217;t really interested in lightening the load of the payroll tax, but it&#8217;s still true.</p></blockquote>
<p>The partial yes is that Ramesh is trying to inject the total tax bite.  But Ramesh – if the Federal government cut payroll taxes but not Social Security benefits but rather used income taxes to help fund the Trust Fund – I bet a lot of liberals would love that proposal.  Oh wait – your crowd wants to cut benefits but keep payroll taxes high in order to bail out the General Fund mess created by the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.</p>

                                <p>In their coverage of that $70 billion addition to the Federal debt, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/11/AR2006051100177_2.html">Washington Post</a> adds:<br />
<blockquote>House Majority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said that holding the line on spending while allowing the low tax rates to spur the economy will close the gap. But the spending problem lies not so much with the federal programs at Congress&#8217;s annual discretion but with entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security, which will grow by 23 percent through 2010. To close the projected budget deficit by 2010, the economy would have to grow at an average annual rate of 4.9 percent &#8211; or 5.5 percent if war costs continue but taper off, according to Leonard E. Burman, a tax policy analyst at the Urban Institute. Such rates have not been seen since the mid-1960s, and most economists see them as impossible, if for no other reason than that the Federal Reserve Board would raise interest rates enough to cool down the growth</p></blockquote>
<p>Real GDP growth averaged 3.5% per year from 1947 to 2000 and if the OMB’s predictions are correct, the average annual growth rate for the first decade of this century will be less than 3%.  Boehner knows that closing the fiscal gap without tax increases cannot happen unless Congress and the White House have the political courage to massively slash government spending, which of course, they don’t.  And for all the nonsense about free lunch supply-side economics, reducing national savings does not increase long-term growth.  </p>
<p><a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/05/medicare-and-social-security-hoax.html">Dean Baker</a> objects to the discussion of entitlements:<br />
<blockquote>The cost of Social Security is rising only slightly faster than GDP. Over the next decade, Social Security spending is projected to increase by just 0.2 percentage points as a share of GDP. By contrast, spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to increase by a total of 1.5 percentage points of GDP. Furthermore, Social Security is financed by a designated tax that is projected to keep the program fully solvent through the 2052 by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. This means that any cuts to Social Security should in principle be matched by cuts in the tax, unless the intention is to mislead people about the purpose of this tax. There is a large and powerful lobby that would badly like to cut and/or privatize Social Security, and they have no qualms about playing with the truth to advance their agenda. The media should not help them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, while the opening of this post says $70 billion &#8211; <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_05/008797.php">Kevin Drum</a> notes:<br />
<blockquote>Here&#8217;s the gimmick. On a regular IRA, you pay no taxes on contributions, but you do pay taxes when you withdraw money. Roth IRAs are just the opposite. So when you do the five-year projections, this bill makes the deficit look a little better because more people are paying taxes on their contributions in 2010-2012 as they switch to a Roth. But the cost is $100 billion or so in the out years. But hey. As long as it makes the five-year projection look better, that&#8217;s all that matters. If you&#8217;re a Republican, anyway.</p></blockquote>

The drop in consumer sentiment reported today by the University of Michigan, as well as <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/bush_poll_dc;_ylt=AsczwPtm9cwpGflbMH7qoLis0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA2Z2szazkxBHNlYwN0bQ--">Bush&#8217;s dismal approval ratings</a>, both seem like echoes from the late 1970s.  From Marketwatch:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Consumer sentiment plunges to 7-month low</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BE16C1EEC-FDFF-4ABB-96FA-8C975CB5DA59%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8211; U.S. consumers&#8217; attitudes about the current economic situation plunged in May at the fastest rate in at least 28 years, according to media reports Friday of proprietary research.</p>
<p>The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index fell to 79.0 in May from 87.4 in April, the lowest since October&#8217;s 74.2. The current conditions index, which tends to track gasoline prices and unemployment, plunged 13 points to 96.2, the biggest one-month decline in the survey&#8217;s 28-year history. It&#8217;s the lowest level for current conditions since October. The expectations index fell to 68.0 from 73.4, also the lowest since October.</p>
<p>Consumer sentiment has fallen in four of the past five months after peaking at 91.5 in December after the economy bounced back from the hurricanes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly, a large part of the explanation for this is simply high gas prices.  High gas prices can sour the mood of the American public in ways that almost nothing else can.  But, at least so far, this pessimism has not translated into much of a slowdown in spending.  If and when that does finally happen, the US economy will surely feel it.</p>

<blockquote>I HADN&#8217;T HEARD THIS: Bush&#8217;s tax cuts make the tax system more progressive, according to a new study from the Joint Economic Committee. Of course, what&#8217;s really interesting is how little tax revenue comes from people in lower brackets.</p></blockquote>
<p>They point to <a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2006/05/joint_economic__1.html">this link</a>, which links to a paper from <a href="http://www.house.gov/jec/publications/109/rr109-36.pdf">Jim Saxton’s hacks</a>. Never mind that Jonah Goldberg can’t bother to read up on the fact that these are only <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/progressive-tax-cut-what-tax-cut.html">tax deferrals</a> (incidentally, Goldberg is continuing to attack Andrew Sullivan for not reading Party of Death as he continues to be too lazy to read anything sensible on economics), neither Jonah nor Glenn has any clue what this paper really says.  It does NOT say the tax code has become more progressive as a result of the most recent tax deferral.  Nor does it say that it is more progressive as a result of either the 2001 or the 2003 tax cuts.  </p>
<p>No, all it says is that if one looks at only Federal income taxes paid, the very rich pay a lot in taxes.  That does not even compare the average tax rates of each group for this narrow subset of taxes paid by individuals.  Never mind all those deferred tax liabilities that George W. Bush wants to pretend no one will be responsible for.  Glenn Reynolds cannot even bother to actually READ a 2-page piece of spin from a bunch of rightwing hacks posing as government economists!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/node/29769">Matthew Yglesias</a> has more closing with:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s a little disappointing that the Republican Party thinks that misleading people is a good use of time for the people working at the JEC and the Council of Economic Advisors when they could be spending time developing policies or trying to make the population better informed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Think about it – we taxpayers foot the bill for Saxton’s hacks at the JEC.  Why am I paying taxes to support economic dishonesty?</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/05/matt_yglesias_i.html">Brad DeLong</a> says young Matthew is a philosophical naïf:<br />
<blockquote>Matt is wrong when he says that Reynolds and Goldberg &#8220;believe the world operates in totally bizarre ways.&#8221; You cannot make inferences from what they write to what their beliefs are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe I’m also a philosophical naïf – so tell me, did Brad just suggest that Jonah Goldberg lies?  Stupidity or Mendacity?  With Goldberg, it is really hard to tell!</p>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODg4MzYxYmY5Y2JhYTk5NWFkNDhlZjJjOTczZjY1YTU=">Greg Kaza</a> is elated that the politicians will start (ab)using dynamic scoring:<br />
<blockquote>Dynamic scoring, however, attempts to measure the feedback-effects ignored in these models &#8211; those feedback-effects potentially becoming excellent ammunition for supply-side policymakers and tax-cut advocates. There’s no doubt that dynamic scoring is today being taken seriously within the budgeting community &#8230; More importantly, as the debate over dynamic scoring heats up, we’re seeing more and more evidence that dynamic scoring actually works. Harvard professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who served as chairman of President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers between 2003 and 2005, wrote in a 2004 paper that “The feedback [from dynamic scoring] is surprisingly large: for standard parameter values, half of a capital tax cut is self-financing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Did Kaza only read the <a href="http://www.nber.org/digest/jul05/w11000.html">summary</a> of the paper by Gregory Mankiw and Matthew Weinzierl?  If so, perhaps he failed to notice something about their model.  Government spending – in the form of transfer payments &#8211; in this paper was assumed to follow tax revenues.  In other words, the model assumed away any material crowding-out effects.  Now given the propensity of the Republican Congress and Bush White House to spend and borrow as they pretend to give us tax cuts, a result that is predicated on the assumption of balanced budgets and no crowding-out is not a useful guide to judging current fiscal policy.</p>
