                                <p>by Stormy</p>
<p>Lawrence Henry Summers, born 1954, mathematically precocious, entered MIT at 16, destined to become the statistician&#8217;s statistician. Later he would <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Unemployment.html" target="_blank">argue</a> that unemployment insurance and welfare encourage long-term unemployment. The argument is a curious one: By encouraging the unemployed to say that they are looking for work, the government then measures unemployment higher than it would normally be, even though they may be totally discouraged. Ergo, safety nets are abusive. Of course, he argued as well for cutting corporate taxation and capital gains.</p>
<p>Whatever we may think of his arguments, I would posit that Lawrence H. Summers is the final expression of what is now wrong. We should have listened to Senator Dorgan.</p>
<p>He has been the financial engineer&#8217;s engineer. That he now leads the charge to &#8220;fix&#8221; a system that he oiled and greased, a system that from which he profited handsomely, should give us pause.</p>
<p>While President of Harvard, ignored the warnings of <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2009/04/03/ex_employee_says_she_warned_harvard_of_risky_moves/" target="_blank">Iris Mack</a>, a Harvard endowment manager who warned that the endowment fund was taking too many risks and that some of its managers may have been guilty of insider trading. Mack asked that the warning be investigated discretely. Shortly after, Mack was fired. Eventually those investment risks came home to roost. But Summers had moved on.</p>
<p>Later D.E. Shaw, one of the largest hedge funds in the world, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/business/06summers.html?hp" target="_blank">hired</a> him for his mathematical acumen in finance, dynamic hedging and Libor rates.</p>
<p>Summers now argues that the work gave him valuable insight into the inner workings of high finance, cleverly spinning his employment as a reason to trust him now.</p>
<p>Apparently, Summers earned his keep to the tune of $5.2 million dollars. D.E. Shaw feels far more comfortable with Summers now in charge of the economic recovery plan than they otherwise might.</p>
<p>Frankly, I do not. Financiers have become all too clever in wringing the last dollar&#8211;all in the name of market efficiency&#8211;from the unwary consumer.</p>
<p>Yet later at the World Bank, Lawrence Henry Summers signed off on a memo that encouraged toxic dumping in underdeveloped countries. Summers now says he did not read the memo carefully, but will take the heat for it. I might let this one pass, but Summers is a man who immerses himself in detail. He reads&#8230;carefully.</p>
<p>Measured against Senator Dorgan, Summers is a lightweight who never really saw the train wreck coming.</p>
<p>While Summers was busy being Secretary of the Treasury, Dorgan in 1999 was <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/4/8/717702/-VIDEO-from-1999:-Byron-Dorgan" target="_blank">delivering a prescient speech</a> on the consequences of the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999.</p>
<p>Dorgan understood the dangers of the concentration of banking services, of the mergers, of financial institutions becoming too big to fail, of derivatives, of &#8220;removing barriers between banks, insurance companies, and investment firms which have existed since the Great Depression.&#8221; [See <a href="http://library.findlaw.com/2000/Oct/1/128177.html" target="_blank">here</a> for a synopsis of the FSMA.]</p>
<p>Where was the astute and brilliant Secretary Summers, protege of the Rubin who found a home in Citibank?</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, he saw this kind of deregulation as increasing international efficiency and competition&#8211;all arguments the moneyed boys were making.</p>
<p>Yes, he was one of the many Democratic leaders lending a helping hand to passage of the FSM Act. Summers has the dubious honor of sharing nesting privileges with that free market vulture Phil Graham.</p>
<p>Frankly, I would be far happier if we could replace clever Summers with the forthright Dorgan.</p>
<p>As Secretary of the Treasury, Lawrence Henry Summers was instrumental in shepherding China into the WTO. It is important to understand precisely how Summers <a href="http://www.usembassy-israel.org.il/publish/press/treasure/archive/2000/may/dt30508.htm" target="_blank">viewed China&#8217;s entry</a> into the WTO. For me, he displays amazing naivete.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<p>&#8220;The agreement with China is a one-way street,&#8221; Summers said.<br />&#8220;China opens its markets to an unprecedented degree, while in return the United States simply maintains its current market access policies,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>
<p>It is difficult, Summers added, &#8220;to discern any disadvantage to the United States in passing this legislation.&#8221; </p>
<p>According to Summers, the United States will continue to press its &#8220;full agenda with China regardless of how Congress votes,&#8221; and &#8220;China will open its markets to other members of the WTO when it joins the system, regardless of how Congress votes.&#8221;<br />By supporting China&#8217;s decision to sign this agreement and enter the WTO, the United States &#8220;can strengthen the hand of those who favor the reform path, and make it more difficult for China to turn back the clock,&#8221; Summers told lawmakers. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No disadvantages? China as a rich market for American goods? The now enormous trade deficit with China must be a mirage.</p>
<p>China has become an export platform. We have been the primary consumers of those exports. All this hype about the vast and rich Chinese market has been just another corporate fairy tale. Anyone who bothered to read how China planned to make its latest great leap forward should have seen this.</p>
<p>How does an impoverished third world country rapidly industrialize? Simple answer: By becoming an export platform to rich consumers. If those rich consumers have easy credit, why, what more can one ask for? Summers helped to pluck the feathers off the American bald eagle. And a scrawny bird he is rapidly becoming.</p>
<p>For Summers, Chinese labor, tax, and environmental arbitrage are pluses for American companies inside China. Profits would be huge&#8211;and indeed they were. Besides, cheap Chinese sweat-shop labor will force Americans to work for less. (Perhaps we should have sweat shops for financial wizards.)</p>
<p>But maybe I am being to harsh to label Summers as a corporate shill. Yet, Summers never spoke about labor conditions inside China. He was not worried that labor could not freely organize in China.</p>
<p>Competition for a fair share of the pie is never the kind of competition of which Summers speaks.<br />Nor was Summers worried about China&#8217;s lack of environmental safeguards. Nor was he concerned about any of the other problems that we have come to know so well: Currency manipulation, for example or export tax rebates or subsidies.</p>
<p>Ask Summers for vision and you will get inanities, simplistic free market drivel. Ask him about markets, and he will cleverly say that markets are self-rectifying.</p>
<p>Now, of course markets are self-rectifying.</p>
<p>For the life of me, I do not understand why this kind of remark passes as great insight. Perhaps the reason is that simpletons can handle only so much complexity in one sitting.</p>
<p>Yes, our trade balance will ultimately find a balance. Yes, instutions that are flawed will fail.</p>
<p>The questions should be:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Should we allow the imbalance to become so excessive that righting it will be extremely painful?</li>
<li>Should we allow financial institutions to become so large that their failure seriously endangers everyone?</li>
<li>Is everything to be measured in terms of immediate profit? And for whom?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the kinds of questions that Dorgan asks. These are the kinds of questions that would never occur to Summers.</p>
<p>Dorgan should be leading the economic recovery team. Summers is the worst of all possible choices.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>One of Keynes&#8217; concepts which never made any sense to me was the idea that there is speculative demand for money.  As far as I could tell, it was a very fance name for the liquidity trap &#8212; if the safe short term interest rate is zero, money is a close substitute for t-bills so money demand becomes enormous &#8212; effectively infinite.</p>
<p>This, of course, is not what he meant at all.  But what could he have had in mind ?  I think one thing is clear, he was, in effect, speaking in the first person.  Keynes was an active investor, and he thought investors sometimes hold money for speculative reasons, so I&#8217;m pretty sure he recalled doing so from time to time.</p>
<p>My sense was that it is obvious if safe short term interest rates are positive, it can&#8217;t possibly be rational to hold money as a store of value, that is to hold money for speculative reasons.   I conclude that I was unconciously making an assumption or two.  Now I think I know what assumption I made.  Assumption after the jump.</p>
<p>Of course I did not assume that money pays zero interest (this assumption is made for simplicity when presenting models to undergraduates).  I assume that there is interest on money (I&#8217;ve never had a non interest paying checking account).  Second I never assume efficient markets.</p>
<p>However, I think I assumed that there is a continuous stream of maturiing bonds, so there is always a bond 5 minutes from maturity.  Well at least one day from maturity.<br />This is not true, at least, of treasury securities (as in safe you know).  </p>
<p>This means that, most nights, the expected overnight yield on the safe security which is closest to maturity is and must be a prediction of its price tomorrow.  In contrast reported yields are the hold to maturity nominal interest rate.  </p>
<p>So it is clearly possible that someone might decide to hold an asset which will mature tomorrow (money) even if the reported yield on a safe short term asset is higher.  Obvious.</p>
<p>I think another barrier to understanding what Keynes meant by speculative demand for money is that, when I was taught, the first step in getting micro foundations for macro models was assuming a representative consumer.  This does not (yet) imply efficient markets, but it does rule out speculative demand for money.  If the representative consumer thinks that the overnight return on money is higher than the expected return on a bond, she will hold only money so financial markets will not clear.   If she expects the return on money is lower, she will only hold money to the extent that she might be forced to sell the bond before it matures &#8212; this is precautionary demand for money not speculative demand for money.  If there is a representative investor, there can&#8217;t be specualative demand for money.</p>
<p>A big if.  If there are different investors and each is convinced that he can beat the market, some will hold money.   Others will want to short money.  If they can, they are called banks.  The money shorted by banks is called money supply (not negative money demand). That means that speculative long positions in money have to be counted as part of money demand.</p>

<blockquote><p> Every soldier who&#8217;s gone to war in the past year paused before leaving to take a brain test — basic math, matching numbers and symbols and identifying patterns to measure response time and accuracy. Now that some of these troops have returned, they&#8217;re taking a fresh round of tests, all part of a broad effort by the military to better treat head injuries.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense is also deploying some unusual weapons for treating the injuries, including paint guns and motion-sensitive video games integrated into therapy at new trauma centers around the country.</p>
<p>Funding for the treatment of these injuries is expected to increase under President Barack Obama, who said Thursday his new military and veterans affairs budget will focus on diagnosing brain injuries and psychological disabilities that have gone untreated.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 service members from the Marines, Air Force, Army and Navy have undergone the testing that became mandatory last year. Those who suffer a concussion or similar head injury will get a follow-up test.</p>
<p>The 101st Airborne Division is the only division going a step further and testing all soldiers again over the last few months as they have been returning to Fort Campbell from tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The tests alone can&#8217;t diagnose traumatic brain injuries, the signature injury of the wars, potentially crippling and sometimes hard to detect damage from blows that can include an exploding roadside bomb, a mortar blast or a vehicle crash.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>But they help doctors zero in on which mental functions are damaged and the best way to treat that by comparing an individual soldier&#8217;s brain function before and after the injury.</p>
<p>Dr. David Twillie, director of a newly opened brain injury care center at Fort Campbell, says the individual results are necessary &#8220;because the brain is a fairly complex organ and because when they experience a fall or a blast, there&#8217;s no way to necessarily pinpoint what particular structures within the brain were injured, because the injuries are microscopic in nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s not really one-size-fits-all,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Military doctors estimate that 10 percent to 20 percent of soldiers sent to Iraq or Afghanistan suffer a TBI. Symptoms can range from minor headaches or dizziness to memory loss or vision problems. And it can take some soldiers a while to realize how severely they&#8217;ve been affected.</p>
<p>Spc. Christopher Ottney hit his head in a vehicle rollover in Afghanistan in May 2008. He woke up in a medical helicopter and had trouble walking and talking. His doctor first saw him walking down hallways hanging onto the walls to keep himself upright.</p>
<p>Ottney said it took him a couple of months to really grasp how the injury affected him, but he&#8217;s made quick progress at Fort Campbell since then.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty stubborn,&#8221; he admits. &#8220;I was in full denial of my injuries and I didn&#8217;t take it seriously what was wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>His cane is gone now, but he still hasn&#8217;t regained all his balance and his eyesight. Still he says, &#8220;I&#8217;ve made a lot of outward progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ottney&#8217;s injury was severe enough that doctors could diagnose it without checking his pre-combat brain test. But experts say milder injuries or concussions can often be hard to detect and can have different side effects for each individual. For mild cases that aren&#8217;t easy to diagnose, a sharp decline in performance on the test can be a warning sign of a brain injury, Twillie said.</p>
<p>The pre-deployment computer exam takes about 20 minutes. Some Fort Campbell soldiers will take the post-deployment test multiple times, along with a survey about injury experiences during deployment, for a special brain study with Walter Reed Army Medical Center.</p>
<p>The military also is establishing new traumatic brain injury clinics at bases across the country to give soldiers better access to treatment. Six are already running and several more are coming with a goal to have a brain injury specialist at every military installation in the country, said Army Col. Rachel Armstrong, who oversees the testing program.</p>
<p>At Fort Campbell&#8217;s brain injury center, which opened in September just as the 101st Airborne began returning from deployment, about 400 soldiers have been screened for TBI, and the center is currently treating about 60 cases. </p>
<p>Some soldiers can recover from mild brain injuries with rest and time away from the battlefield, Twillie said. Others will have prolonged or lifelong symptoms requiring continuing care. Many soldiers see improvement after therapy. </p>
<p>Soldiers go through a battery of tests to measure different cognitive functions. Visual tests show how fast and accurately a soldier can recognize letters, a driving simulator gives soldiers the feeling of driving under different environmental conditions and a Nintendo Wii game system, with its motion-sensitive controller, helps with coordination skills. </p>
<p>Once a soldier&#8217;s individual deficiencies are identified, therapy can be designed to help retrain the brain to overcome those problems, Twillie said. </p>
<p>The base is also using combat training techniques to help brain-injured soldiers readjust to life on the battlefield. Recovering soldiers are tested in simulated battle with paint guns in a mock Baghdad neighborhood. </p>
<p>Before a mortar round shook him up in Afghanistan, Sgt. 1st Class Landon Ranker, 38, could lead an entire platoon of infantry soldiers through complicated tasks. His injury made it hard for him focus in stressful and confusing situations. </p>
<p>Part of his therapy program is practicing his ability to focus in a battle simulation: a fake mess hall bombing with several training dummies that bleed and breathe and need medical attention. </p>

<p>For every higher score on a test or every small goal they complete, soldiers regain confidence in their ability to return to their jobs, Twillie said. </p>
<p>&#8220;First of all it shows us that the service member is able to perform, but the most important thing is it tells the service member that they will be able to perform,&#8221; Twillie said. &#8220;And that bit of confidence piece of it is really important.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>(Well it seems a little slow around the Bear Cave today, sorry if this seems like deja vu all over again.)</p>
<p>DI or Social Security Disability Insurance is maybe not in immediate crisis but it is not well. But then again it has been ailing for a long time and where the current recession has given the OAS (Old Age/Survivors) component of Social Security the sniffles, the already compromised immune system of DI has succumbed to pneumonia. Which doesn&#8217;t mean that both need to be rushed to the Emergency Room. Lets take a look at the Figures and Tables.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdjW7gVkCkI/AAAAAAAAAJM/9FBvyBvicH8/s1600-h/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdjW7gVkCkI/AAAAAAAAAJM/9FBvyBvicH8/s400/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />In this graph the dark line represents OAS and the gray line DI while Roman number I shows outcomes under the Low Cost alternative, II under the standard Intermediate Cost alternative, and III the High Cost all as seen from March 2008 in last year&#8217;s Social Security Report. In each case the lines track Trust Fund balances as a percentage of annual cost over time meaning that when they hit bottom Trust Fund assets are depleted, meaning that changes HAVE to be made on either the tax or benefit side for that particular program. But this is not one size fits all, the appropriate fix for DI may be much different that that for OAS, and certainly the urgency levels very.</p>
<p>For example under HIgh Cost DI was projected to go to Depletion in 2017, under Intermediate Cost in 2025, under Low Cost never, if fact it was projected to be vastly overfunded after 2025. But setting Low Cost aside we can see that under both High and Intermediate Cost that DI was in comparatively bad shape even before the depth of the current recession became apparent. If we turn around and examine this in dollar terms it looks like this:<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sd47YnFeFkI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/uJdsOUs8cJA/s1600-h/2008+IV.A2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sd47YnFeFkI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/uJdsOUs8cJA/s400/2008+IV.A2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />In this table the combination of &#8216;Net contributions&#8217; and &#8216;Tax on benefits&#8217; represents Tax Revenues actually extracted from the current year economy while &#8216;Cost&#8217; represents dollars actually expended. If &#8216;Net contributions&#8217; and &#8216;Tax on benefits&#8217; exceeds &#8216;Total&#8217; Cost then dollars flow from Social Security to the General Fund, if they fall short then the flow goes the other way. Hassett and Biggs of AEI insist that this is the proper measure of &#8216;vanishing Surplus&#8217; and so marks the time for action. I on the other hand prefer to use the CBO definition of &#8216;Surplus&#8217; which includes interest earned on the Trust Fund balance. But squabbling over the terminology is to miss the point at hand, what AEI has done is conflate OAS and DI in an inappropriate way. Inappropriate at least when it comes to changing policy. Explanation below the fold.</p>
<p>In the normal course of events there is little harm in talking about THE Social Security Trust Fund, for most purposes that is how the Trustees discuss the matter, how CBO and OMB treat it for Unified Budget calculations, and how Dean Baker addresses  it. And this is pretty well explained by comparing the combined OASDI TF ratios  to the above figure separating OAS and DI out.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/R_PB6t4ggSI/AAAAAAAAAAM/JjA6Q-1kAOQ/s1600-h/Snapshot+2008-04-02+10-08-52.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/R_PB6t4ggSI/AAAAAAAAAAM/JjA6Q-1kAOQ/s320/Snapshot+2008-04-02+10-08-52.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />One you adjust for the difference in scale on the y-axis you can see that under Intermediate Cost that outcomes for combined OASDI are very little different from those of OAS taken alone with the former showing Trust Fund Depletion in 2041 while OAS alone showing it in 2042.  And the reason is pretty simple, OAS at around $2.2 trillion is around ten times the size of DI at around $220 billion, OAS is the dog compared to the DI tail, however vigorously the latter wags it doesn&#8217;t move the whole dog much.</p>
<p>Which is where the AEI folk go astray, they saw some tail movement in February and let the tail wag the dog, when in fact the dog was in reality not moving much at all. If we pull back a little and examine DI numbers in isolation we can see that the combination of &#8216;Net contributions&#8217; and &#8216;Tax on benefits&#8217; fell behind &#8216;Cost&#8217; early in 2006 as we saw $92 billion in tax revenues and $94.5 billion in cost over the year. The world didn&#8217;t come to an end, instead Treasury retired some maturing Special Treasuries and supplied GF cash to make up the difference. Since this didn&#8217;t require the entirety of the earned interest on the DI Trust Fund the TF balance still increased over the year by $8.2 billion. But per AEI definitions this is not a &#8216;surplus&#8217; instead DI has been in deficit for almost three years and well before the current recession was even underway. The recession did have the effect of making DI&#8217;s outlook deteriorate, but that was only to accelerate a trend already in progress.</p>
<p>The Trustees put it this way last March. Bolding mine.<br />
<blockquote>Assets of the DI Trust Fund were greater than 1 year’s expenditures at the beginning of 2008 and would remain above that level through the beginning of 2017. By the beginning of 2018, however, the trust fund ratio is projected to decline to 95 percent, indicating that assets would fall below the 100-per cent level sometime during 2017. Accordingly, the DI Trust Fund does not satisfy the Trustees’ short-range test of financial adequacy under both the intermediate and high cost assumptions. However, under the low cost assumptions the DI Trust Fund does meet the short-range test of financial adequacy, because assets remain above 1 year’s expenditures through the end of the short-range period,</p></blockquote>
<p>Meaning that the claim that the  current recession CAUSED the SS surplus however defined to &#8216;vanish&#8217; is pure bunk. Under CBO scoring both combined OASDI and OAS by itself are in surplus and will remain so until after 2019, in reality the dog barely stirred, the dates of OAS TF shortfall and depletion hardly moving. Even if we use AEI&#8217;s preferred definition of &#8216;Surplus&#8217; we see combined surpluses continuing to 2017 for OASDI and to 2019 for OAS alone which barely moves the outcome as seen on the graphs above.</p>
<p>On the other hand DI is kind of a sick puppy right now.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sd42phxrUZI/AAAAAAAAAJk/yYKGKACRrPY/s1600-h/OASDI+March+2009+CBO.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sd42phxrUZI/AAAAAAAAAJk/yYKGKACRrPY/s400/OASDI+March+2009+CBO.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /> Where the Trustees projected a $3.3 billion cash deficit in 2008, reality returned a cash deficit of $8 billion. Where the Trustees showed a cash deficit of $4.6 billion for 2009, CBO now projects $20 billion. And where the Trustees projected that TF assets would stop growing and start shrinking in 2012 with TF Depletion in 2025, CBO reports that those assets started shrinking last year (I put it right around July per the TF Monthly Reports) and will go to Depletion in 2019, a six year difference from what the Trustees projected just a year ago.</p>
<p>So what is the proper policy response? We need to fix DI. And just DI and not let the opposition make the claim &#8216;Well since we are forced to fix DI we might as well fix OAS too.&#8217; Well no, it is not clear that OAS is even sick. Certainly the economy gave it a chill, a system that relies on a fixed percentage of wage income is obviously not immune to double digit unemployment, and we would want to keep an eye on that cold and mild fever, in medical terms OAS in &#8216;under observation&#8217;. But that doesn&#8217;t dictate the kind of radical surgery AEI is pushing.</p>
<p>How do you fix DI? Well there are only three ways. One you can just cut benefits to current recipients. But it is not like those checks are that generous to start with. Two you can restrict eligibility. But current approval rates and times for that approval are already scandalous. Or three you can raise taxes. Something the people at AEI normally resist. Which in my opinion is why nobody raised the DI issue back in 2006 when by AEI definitions it first went into deficits, because while you can get some political mileage by attacking Boomers for not having enough regard for intergenerational equity there is not much payoff attacking people in wheelchairs or on oxygen or with pacemakers.</p>
<p>So if we are not willing to cut benefits to DI recipients or to make eligibility even harder to qualify for we are left with taxation. Per the Trustees the cost of a permanent fix for DI over the 75 year actuarial window was 0.24%. If we just wanted to fix it totally for the 25 year period to 2033 and partially after that we could reduce the initial fix down to 0.15% of payroll. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#274087">Table IV.B4.—Components of Summarized Income Rates and Cost Rates, Calendar Years 2008-82[As a percentage of taxable payroll]</a>. Meaning that for a median income family with total wages of $50,000 would mean $120/year or $75/year respectively. Or we could look at this Table and conclude &#8216;Hell we still got $216 billion in credit with the Treasury, why not just draw on it rather than raise taxes even a little bit in this recession.&#8217;<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdPHahTL2kI/AAAAAAAAAIE/7xF4w5SKqLk/s1600-h/DI-Feb.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdPHahTL2kI/AAAAAAAAAIE/7xF4w5SKqLk/s400/DI-Feb.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />So yes DI is kind of sick, and probably we should undertake some longer term cure, but we certainly can wait until we see how and if the economy recovers. But the last thing we should do is let people fundamentally hostile to Social Security to start with to rush us into an overhaul of the whole system because of a one-time blip in monthly numbers that itself is mostly the result of incomplete context.

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=mind_the_wage_gap">Just a reminder</a> of reality for the many:</p>
<blockquote><p>But Mr. President what does real prosperity look like? </p>
<p>There is a fair amount of talk lately that the severity of the current economic downturn will produce new generation of depression-era babies, people terrified into thrift and frugality by the hard times. The Wall Street Journal noted earlier this year that, &#8220;U.S. household debt, which has been growing steadily since the Federal Reserve began tracking it in 1952, declined for the first time in the third quarter of 2008. In the same quarter, U.S. consumer spending growth declined for the first time in 17 years.&#8221; And nothing gotten better since. </p>
<p>But where does this fiscal chastity lead us? What replaces the frenzied consumer spending that gave the economy its gallop over the last 20 years? Responsible, within-your-means purchases, unaffected by the $150 billion in advertising spent annually selling us stuff? </p>
<p>That sounds like 1952, and, frankly, Americans are just not going to go for it, because the modern manifestation of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is the ability to go to the mall. That was the whole point of expanding the middle class, so they could add the economic clout to the economy. </p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that, while they were propping up the economy over the last couple of decades, those middle class workers were not reaping their fair share of the benefits. In fact they were getting screwed by the financiers we&#8217;re now forced to rescue. Since the 1970s, American workers have become more productive without getting paid for those increases in productivity. And it was those very people who went into debt to maintain their standard of living and who kept the economy going as long as it did. </p>
<p>So while we&#8217;ve been wracked with angst about the failures of the financial system, <strong>it is really the slow collapse of the wage economy that may be most responsible for getting us into the ugly position we now find ourselves</strong>. The coming fight over the Employee Free Choice Act in one obvious place to have this discussion, but that is likely not the way it’ll go down. Simply on the symbolic merits, EFCA should fly through the Congress; we know it won&#8217;t. I sense &#8212; and I could be wrong about this &#8212; that the administration is presently more willing to spend its political capital trying to reassure Wall Street than passing the EFCA. But they should not let the political theatrics obscure the fact that there is another sector that is really too big to fail. The people who will rebuild the economy are workers with enough money in their pockets to take care of all their needs without going into huge debt. That is a sustainable standard for living that could drive support a sustainable economy.</p></blockquote>
