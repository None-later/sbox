<blockquote>Even the Dow&#8217;s record is not quite as impressive as it seems. If inflation is taken into account, the Dow has to rise another 2,150 points before it will set an all-time high.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does seem that certain <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NjczNjQ5N2QwYjZjMTc2OTQ1NjI3NjkwMjhhOWNlMWU=">rightwingers</a> are high-fiving over the fact that the Dow has reached 85% of its January 2000 level in real terms.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/10/the_stock_market_is_not_the_ho.html#013815">Dean Baker</a> adds this perspective:<br />
<blockquote>One infuriating feature of business reporting is the constant cheering for a higher stock market. I have nothing against a higher market, but I know of no general public interest in a high stock market. In principle, the stock market represents the discounted value of the future profits of corporate America. If the value rises because the economy can now be seen as growing more rapidly, then this is certainly good news. But, if future profits are projected to be higher because of lower wages or lower corporate taxes (e.g. a higher tax burden on workers or fewer public services), why should the mass of the population, who own little or no stock celebrate? Of course, the higher stock market may just be due to the irrational exuberance of people who control lots of money, as happened in the nineties. This is also not obviously good news. In this case, a higher stock market will shift wealth to those smart enough to get out, from those stupid enough to get in.</p></blockquote>
<p>Was the high flying stock market in early 2000 due to irrational exuberance or was it due to expectations that long-term economic growth would continue to be strong?  In either case, one cannot argue that economic growth has been strong over the past six years – so we have to look elsewhere for why the stock market has partially recovered.  Dean mentions two other possibilities: (1) a shift of the tax burden away from capital income and towards labor income; and (2) little of the increase in labor productivity has accrued to real compensation for workers (that is, a shift in the share of national income towards capital income).  Our graph shows that employee compensation as a share of national income has declined.  Now we have argued that the fiscal policy of the Bush Administration has not reduced taxes – only shifted them into the future.  So whether the tax burden on capital income has been reduced is speculative as the White House refuses to tell us who will be responsible for the future tax increases that will be needed to reduce the mushrooming Federal debt.   But it is pretty clear that the GOP would rather impose this burden on either consumption or employment income.  It would seem that both of these latter possibilities are valid explanations even if the <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZmVmMjYxYjA5MWVjOTY4MzE2MDY2NjE5ZjRmOWE4OWE=">supply-side spin</a> is not. After all – given the increase in the share of income going to capital income and the apparent shift in the tax burden away from capital income – one has to wonder why stock prices in real terms are not higher than they were in early 2000.</p>

<blockquote>After all, Ronald Reagan, the man whose legacy Bush has supposedly betrayed, presided over a federal government that consumed 23.5 percent of GDP in 1984. Granted, this was at the height of the Cold War defense build-up, yet the figure far surpasses spending under President Clinton, which reached a low of 18 percent of GDP in 2001. Under Bush, spending has inched over 20 percent of GDP, a definite increase from the era of the &#8220;peace dividend.&#8221; But spending is still far from Reagan-era levels. And the post-9/11 defense buildup (defense spending has increased by roughly 40 percent over 2001 levels, to nearly half a trillion dollars) accounts for the bulk of the increased spending. When you factor out spending on homeland security, domestic discretionary spending has barely budged under Bush.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this sounds about right – the National Review’s <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MDU3ZmI3ZDk2M2Q5ZDY3MDI3YzBlNjU0ZDJmZDdiODU=">Ramesh Ponnuru</a> chooses to quibble:<br />
<blockquote>But I have real disagreements with Douthat and Salam as well. It seems to me that they are much too generous about Bush&#8217;s generosity with taxpayer dollars here: &#8220;When you factor out spending on homeland security, domestic discretionary spending has barely budged under Bush&#8221; (their emphasis). I&#8217;m not sure that looking solely at domestic discretionary spending makes sense, especially given an administration that asked for, and received, a new entitlement program for prescription drugs for the elderly. In addition, depending on our purpose, we might want a yardstick that takes into account the possibility, even if it is a theoretical one, that domestic spending could be cut to make room for higher defense and security spending. But even ignoring those two caveats, I don&#8217;t think that the authors&#8217; claim is true. Brian Riedl of the Heritage Foundation has looked at domestic discretionary spending, excluding homeland-security spending, and he finds that it rose 40 percent between 2001 and 2006. (That&#8217;s 7 percent annually.) That&#8217;s more than it rose during Clinton&#8217;s entire eight years (39 percent, or 4.2 percent annually).</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking at nominal increases is the kind of stupidity we have come to expect from National Review nitwits like Lawrence Kudlow.  But Ponnuru has a real point about the costly prescription drug program, which has yet to be really factored into historical reviews of spending.  </p>
<p>Douthat-Salam and Ponnuru toss around “big government conservative” and “small government conservative” a lot but neither piece dared to raise the “T-word”, so let me remind them of Milton Friedman’s adage “to spend is to tax”.  President Bush keeps exciting conservatives by telling them he has cut taxes and he intends to make those tax cuts permanent.  One would think that just a little space in the Weekly Standard and/or the National Review could be used to tell their readers that Bush’s fiscal policy has only shifted the tax burden to the future – especially as they debate just how much spending has increased.</p>

                                <p>CNN’s title is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/10/03/woodward.rice/index.html">Spokesman: Rice didn&#8217;t &#8216;brush off&#8217; terror warnings</a>.  Really?  How would she know whether she did or not as she does not remember this meeting?<br />
<blockquote>Rice, now secretary of state, told reporters traveling with her Sunday that she did not remember any &#8220;so-called emergency meeting&#8221; and said any meeting records had been turned over to the 9/11 commission. &#8220;What I am quite certain of, however, is that I would remember if I was told, as this account apparently says, that there was about to be an attack in the United States,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And the idea that I would somehow have ignored that I find incomprehensible, especially given that in July when we were getting a very steady stream of quite alarmist reports of potential attacks.&#8221; But State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters Monday that Rice did meet with Tenet on July 10, and the records were made available to the commission.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Dr. Rice does not recall having that 12/20/2000 meeting with Sandy Berger where Mr. Berger says he gave Dr. Rice the invasion plans for taking out the Taliban.  Maybe her lack of memory is the reason that Richard Clarke decided to re-present the plans to her right after George Bush took office.  Oh NOW Dr. Rice remembers getting these invasion plans and also remembers that President Bush rejected the idea as “swatting flies” (Osama bin Laden is a fly?) or not doing “tit for tat” (Condi’s cute word for invading another country).  </p>
<p>One really has to wonder about the memory of someone who could not even recall the title of that 8/6/2001 PDB.  All this time – I thought Dr. Rice was a liar.   Maybe President Bush appointed as his National Security Advisor a scatter brain who could not remember important matters such as a meeting that was <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/10/03/rice-urgent-threat">10 on a scale of 1 to 10</a>.  But to Clueless Condi, this meeting was so “relatively unremarkable” that she can’t even recall it.   </p>
<p>I just hope Stephen Hadley has more focus and a better memory than his predecessor.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/2006/10/would-al-gore-have-prevented-911_04.html">Daniel Shaviro</a> writes:<br />
<blockquote>As I look at the public information that has dribbled out over the last few years, I increasingly think that the answer is Yes. I should note that this is nothing particular about Gore. The sense I increasingly get is that just about anyone and everyone who has been a serious Presidential candidate in the last 50 years could also have prevented 9/11. If this reasoning is correct, then 9/11 would have been prevented, not only by Al Gore, but also (for example) by John McCain, Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, George H.W. Bush, Dick Gephardt, Michael Dukakis, Ronald Reagan, Fritz Mondale, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey, Barry Goldwater, and Dwight Eisenhower, to name just a few.</p></blockquote>
<p>Daniel explains why he believes almost anyone other than the clueless team working for George W. Bush would have prevented 9/11.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In my last post, I tried to compare the relative competence in military affairs of the current administration relative to that of the Reagan, GHW Bush, and Clinton administrations. There is no actual measure of “competence” so I picked a proxy – an admittedly imperfect (namely, changes in the death rate by accident and illness of American military personnel) one, but for what its worth, the conclusions it leads to seem to fit with some other evidence (e.g., that this administration is the first to be well on its way to losing two major wars, and those against somewhat incompetent and disorganized opponents).</p>
<p>In the last few days, I’ve been out of town and without much access to a computer and/or news. I heard bits and pieces about the Foley affair, which led me to start thinking about the whole “culture of corruption” thing. As a guy who likes to look at data, I started to wonder – how do you measure corruption? Corruption is an intangible – an important intangible, but still an intangible – and intangibles are hard to measure.</p>
<p>In the case of corruption, there is a <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Corruption Index </a>that seems to be reasonably credible when it comes to comparing the relative corruption of various countries. But say that one wanted to look at whether an administration was more or less corrupt than its predecessors? Or whether a political party had recently become a lot more corrupt. Presumably, one could count convictions. But… without spending many, many hours finding this information, where is this data? Is there any organization out there that keeps a credible count of members of an administration or political party that are convicted?</p>
<p>Of course, even convictions are only a proxy, and every proxy has its problems. For example, convictions are something of a lagging indicator if anything, and it would be nice to be able to say in real time whether an administration or party truly is corrupt or not. Another problem with convictions is that without a prosecution, there can be no conviction, and some administrations are more brazen about not following laws than others.</p>
<p>Because no single measure is perfect, it makes sense to look at multiple measures. I was thinking that “supplemental appropriations” as a percentage of Federal Spending might be a good measure of incompetence and/or mendacity. Katrinas happen, but calling the ongoing cost of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (not to say some of the cost of modernizing the military) <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/amendments.htm">“special circumstances that could not be foreseen when the President&#8217;s budget was transmitted to Congress” </a>seems to be, at the very least, disingenuous. (Its worse if you take the administration at its word and assume those costs truly aren’t being anticipated when the budget is being prepared.)</p>
<p>Anyone have any idea where one can find historical data on supplemental appropriations in an easy to use format? Or data on convictions by party or administration? What are things you think would be cool to see measured, and can you think of ways to do it that don’t require more time gathering than crunching the numbers?</p>

<blockquote>You probably remember well when Bill Clinton and the Democrats passed the largest single tax increase in our nation&#8217;s history in 1993, $293 billion. That sent our nation into an economic slump.</p></blockquote>
<p>OxBlog:<br />
<blockquote>I still have nightmares about the Great Depression of &#8217;93. The bread lines grew longer every day. I wore out the soles of my shoes, walking up and down the length of Manhattan looking for an honest day&#8217;s work. Wait a second. That was 1893. What the ***** is Santorum talking about? The &#8217;90s were great.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – average annual real GDP growth equal to 3.7% is awful, whereas the average annual real GDP growth since Bush took office (2.6%) is great!  Employment (payroll survey) during Clinton’s eight years in office grew by a mere 23 million.  Since George W. Bush took office, employment has grown by an amazing 3 million.</p>

                                <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The numbers are out, and the first day of Fiscal 2007 set an all time record debt increase for the first day of a fiscal year: $41.4 Billion.  No surprise. </p>
<p>For the Federal Government, Fiscal 2006 ended on September 30th. And during the coming month, the Bush Administration will surely trumpet their progress on the budget deficit.</p>
<p>Never mind the near record <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/10/fiscal-2006-national-debt-increases.html">increase</a> in the National Debt ($574.3 Billion in fiscal 2006).  And never mind the accounting tricks the Bush Administration used to achieve that poor result.  </p>
<p>The Bush Administration will focus solely on the Unified Budget deficit, and compare fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005, and they will also compare to their previous absurd forecasts. Of course the Unified Budget is the wrong budget metric for evaluating the Administration&#8217;s budget management performance, but I won&#8217;t revisit that issue in this post.</p>
<p>Instead I&#8217;ll look at previous CBO projections.  The first graph shows the CBO budget <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=2727&#038;sequence=1&#038;from=0">forecasts</a> from January 2001.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/640/bogus1.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/320/bogus1.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>It was a glorious time: the off-budget surpluses (mostly Social Security) were increasing steadily and the on-budget surpluses were increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>The second graph shows the CBO budget <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=3277&#038;sequence=1&#038;from=0">forecasts</a> from January 2002 &#8211; just one year later.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/640/bogus2.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/320/bogus2.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The difference between the two forecasts is dramatic.  The off-budget (Social Security) surpluses were still growing steadily, but the on-budget surplus disappeared because of the 2001 recession and the Bush tax shifts (shifting the tax burden from current taxpayers to future taxpayers).  </p>
<p>In addition, the January 2001 projections were probably overoptimistic.  The projections used the tax revenue from the late &#8217;90s as a base, most likely without fully considering the tax implications of the bursting stock market bubble.</p>
<p>For the final graph, I&#8217;ll jump ahead to the August 2006 CBO <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/budget/08-17-budproj.pdf">forecast</a>.  Once again the forecast is for the off-budget surpluses to increase steadily; and once again the on-budget deficits are far worse than the previous estimates. </p>

<p>But look at the on-budget deficit for 2006.  It shows a small improvement over 2005, and then the CBO projects the on-budget deficit to worsen in fiscal 2007.  </p>
<p>But compare 2006 to the earlier CBO estimates &#8211; 2006 is a complete disaster.  And the bad news is another bubble is bursting right now (the housing bubble), and IMO the CBO estimates are once again ignoring the budget implications of that bursting bubble.</p>
<p>So when the Bush Administration touts their budget progress in the coming weeks, remember where we were just a few years ago.  And remember where the budget deficit is likely to go.  They call that progress?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.danielgross.net/archives/2006/10/01-week/index.html#a001198">Daniel Gross</a> takes on Edward (“Crazy Eddie” as Max Sawicky calls him) Lazear and Allan (no relation to Glenn) Hubbard:<br />
<blockquote>Allan Hubbard, director of the National Economic Council, and Edward Lazear, chairman of the president&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisers, take to the op-ed page of the Wall Street Journal as part of an effort to convince Americans their wages haven&#8217;t been falling &#8211; and that if they haven&#8217;t, it&#8217;s not the administration&#8217;s fault, anyway. From Hubbard, one expects such junk. But Lazear, a respected academic economist, now shows signs of succumbing to the same tendency that struck his respected-academic-economist predecessors Gregory Mankiw and Glenn Hubbard: retailing intellectual garbage in an effort to make their boss look better.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though the <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/subscribers.html">WSJ</a> provides a link to “Coming of Wage”, one needs a subscription so let’s turn back to Daniel Gross for what he sees as the offending comments:<br />
<blockquote>Over the first half of this year, compensation growth has averaged a remarkable 6.3%, at an annual rate adjusted for inflation. This growth is much faster than in previous years … Recently, nominal wages of production workers have also grown considerably. At an annualized rate, nominal wage growth has been about 4% so far this year, faster than at this point in the last economic expansion. Nominal wages are now growing faster than the past couple of years and are growing at about the same rate as they were in the late 1990s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Daniel Gross is correct about the intellectual dishonesty of using nominal wage increases:<br />
<blockquote>This last bit is the most pernicious and intellectually dishonest one. What&#8217;s the point in comparing nominal wage growth in an economy where inflation is growing at 3.8 percent (i.e. today&#8217;s) to nominal wage growth in an economy where inflation was growing at 2 percent or less? Do people pay their bills and mortgages with nominal dollars or with real ones? I&#8217;m wondering if you asked Hubbard and Lazear whether, they&#8217;d prefer (a) having a 4 percent nominal raise in a year when inflation rose 3.8 percent; or (b) having a 3.6 percent nominal raise in a year when inflation rose 1.6 percent; they&#8217;d choose (a) as being equivalent or better. But that&#8217;s precisely what they&#8217;re asking their readers to do. </p></blockquote>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides series for “total employer costs for employee compensation” breaking this down into wages&#038;salaries versus total benefits from early 2004 to 2006QII.  Over the past two years, total compensation has increased from $24.96 to $26.86- which is a 7.6% increase.  For those who think in terms of real compensation – note that the consumer price index rose by 7.4%.  Not exactly a large increase over the past two years.</p>
<p>Now it is true that total benefits rose by 11% from $7.26 to $8.06, while nominal wages rose from $17.70 to $18.80 – that is, a mere 6.2% nominal increase.  Every freshman student of economics should know that if nominal wages rise by less than the increase in the cost of living, real wages have declined.  I’m sure Crazy Eddie knows this – but does Allan Hubbard get the simple point?</p>

<blockquote>The Treasury Department reported today that the National Debt increased $574.3 Billion in Fiscal 2006, compared to $553.7 Billion in Fiscal 2005. The record annual increase was $595.8 Billion in Fiscal 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>And before one argues that 2006 was $20 billion better than 2004, check out the gimmicks used to keep the reported number from reaching $600 billion as reported by CR who concludes:<br />
<blockquote>Not paying your bills and relying on accounting tricks doesn&#8217;t make the fiscal situation better; it just makes it look better in the short term.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Does <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/10/01/newt-foley">Newt Gingrich</a> understand the words that come out of his mouth?  Chris Wallace interviewed the former Speaker of the House who was trying to excuse the fact that the current Speaker ignored this scandal:<br />
<blockquote>WALLACE: Speaker Gingrich, did House Republican leaders do all they should have? <br />GINGRICH: Well, I think if you look at what they actually knew, which was that the family did not want anyone involved, and the actual notes were relatively innocuous, there was nothing sexual in those notes.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the House leadership had no idea there was anything sexual going on?  But then Chris Wallace wanted to know why an earlier investigation would be construed as “gay bashing”:<br />
<blockquote>WALLACE: Well, how would it have been gay bashing? <br />GINGRICH: Because it was a male-male relationship. And it had no &#8211; there was no proof, there was nothing that I know of in that initial round that would have led you to say in a normal circumstance that this is a predatory person.</p></blockquote>
<p>A “male-male relationship” between a 15-year boy and a grown man.  How did this goofball ever become Speaker of the House?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/29/AR2006092901574.html">Charles Babington and Jonathan Weisman</a> write:<br />
<blockquote>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took the House floor last night to demand an investigation into the Foley matter. But Boehner headed her off, calling on the House to refer the matter to the ethics committee, which the House promptly voted unanimously to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pelosi’s motion makes a lot of sense so why would anyone vote to table it – except a partisan GOP hack.  All Democrats voted to table it including Pelosi.  <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/corruption_in_washington_/2006/10/query.php">Mark Kleiman</a> is on the story and writes:<br />
<blockquote>there were audible &#8220;noes&#8221; on the voice vote and Pelosi demanded the ayes and nays.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just like these tyrants under Hastert’s corrupt leadership – they table a motion to investigate this scandal and their own cover-up of it by recording a unanimous vote when many in the House voted no to the tabling.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Since <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjJhYzQwNWFiYzhhZTAxZTVmZjIwODU4MjM3MWY5MDg=">Thomas Nugent</a> decides to debate Howard Dean only after Howard Dean has left the room – will you pardon me for cutting in?<br />
<blockquote>Dean says: “The Republican record on managing the federal budget is dismal. Republicans have turned surplus into debt, hope into lost opportunity; they have become the party of borrow-and-spend.”</p>
<p>I say: The budget deficit increased for two reasons: to get us out of the Clinton recession of 2001 and to overcome the economic effects of the terrorist attacks on 9/11. As a result, the U.S. economy has recovered and has been growing at an above-average rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>The “I” here is Mr. Nugent.  The reality is that average annual real GDP growth has been only 2.6% over the past 5.5 years.   Sure, we had a recession followed by a recovery.  Recessions are typically followed by recoveries – with or without tax cuts.<br />
<blockquote>Dean says: “The Joint Committee on Taxation [JCT] estimates that the total cost this year of the president’s tax cuts is $258 billion.”</p>
<p>I say: The notion that giving people back their hard-earned money through tax cuts is somehow a “cost” tells us something about the Deanocrat mentality. In their world, the government owns everything.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is just the beginning of Mr. Nugent screaming “Spend more, tax more.”  Does he not understand what President Bush’s fiscal record has been?  Spend more, tax later.<br />
<blockquote>Dean says: “We will restore honesty in government, starting with the pay-as-you-go discipline in Congress that served Mr. Clinton so well.”</p>
<p>I say: “PAYGO” is another way of saying, “No more tax cuts folks, unless of course you cut spending, even though the Bush tax cuts have produced more tax revenues than expected.” The Deanocrats don’t understand what Jack Kennedy understood so clearly: Tax-rate cuts stimulate economic activity; they do not retard economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are two gigantic errors in this reply.  First of all – PAYGO could mean cut spending before one cuts taxes.  As far as Nugent’s free lunch supply-side spin here – does he still think an average growth rate of 2.6% is greater than the 3.5% average annual growth rate for the last half of the 20th century?  Does he not understand that reducing national savings tends to reduce long-term growth?</p>
<p>Thank goodness Mr. Nugent had the dignity of letting Howard Dean leave the building before uttering such utter stupidity.  I wouldn’t want another episode of Howard Dean screaming – so let it be me that screams out at the sheer nonsense that comes from the National Review!</p>
