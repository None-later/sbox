<p>I think I have an answer to the question <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/11-growth.html">Cactus</a> posed in regards the claim from <a href="http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=11814">R. Emmett Tyrell </a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the past five years, per capita gross domestic product has grown at 11%. We are living through a vast global economic boom, and the Democrats seem completely unawares. In 2008 their presidential candidate will be moaning that we have lost a war and are economically in a hell of a mess. The Republican will only have to point to a healthy economy and the success of General Petraeus&#8217;s splendid army to win. Then the Democrats will whine that the Republicans stole the election from them. That is my prediction, and I base it on the evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cactus and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/r-emmett-tyrell-has-money-illusion.html">yours truly</a> need to rephrase our questions.  Instead of asking Mr. Tyrell why not adjusted inflation, the question should have been – did you adjust for inflation.  It turns out he tried to so if I had asked if he has money illusion, the answer would be no.  Mr. Tyrell is at least guilty of unclear writing and failing to provide his sources.  And as we shall see, his math skills are poor.  </p>
<p>Our table compares 2007QII to 2002QII in terms of nominal GDP per capita, which is given by line 1 of table 7.1 from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">this source</a>.  It turns out that nominal GDP per capita rose by 25.73 percent, which prices rose by 15 percent.  So I guess Mr. Tyrell took the difference between nominal growth (n) and the growth of prices (p) to get real growth (r).  Let’s see: 25.73% minus 15% = 10.73% and rounding up.  But that’s not the right way to do this.  The correct formula is (n – p)/(1 + p) = 10.73%/1.15 = 9.32%.  Of course, we could have gone directly to line 6 of table 7.1.  </p>
<p>Besides bad writing and poor math skills, it would seem Mr. Tyrell has trouble putting things into a longer-term perspective – which gives me an excuse to graph real GDP per capita from 1997.  The graph shows something that is not surprising to most people who have followed the US economy.  After the late 1990’s boom in real income per person, we saw real income per person actually decline during the first one and a half years of the Bush Administration. Think about this way, real income per person as of 2007QII was only 9.22 percent higher than it was as of 2000QIV.  It would seem that a 9.2 percent increase over 6.5 years sounds a lot less dramatic than an 11% increase over 5 years.  During the last 6.5 years of the Clinton Administration, real income per capita grew by 17.3 percent.  </p>
<p>We should also note that real income per person represents the mean not the median.  The Census Bureau reports the median household income in 2005 CPI-U-RS adjusted dollars for 2005 was only $46,326 (less than $40, 3000 in 2000$).  So the median family is receiving less than 10 percent more income than the average person.  The $46,326 was less than the real median income for 2000, which was $47,671.  It would seem whatever real per capita income growth we are getting is accruing to the well to do and not the median household.  But would one expect Mr. Tyrell to both recognize this reality and to be honest to his readers about it?</p>

                                <p>Regular readers know I have written a large number of posts on how Presidents since Ike have performed at various tasks, from economic growth to cutting the rate of abortions. But what is the President&#8217;s job? What&#8217;s he supposed to do?</p>
<p>I wandered over to the White House page, and clicked on the tab that reads &#8220;president&#8221;. That took me <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/">here</a> where I was greeted by this:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtBey09FIcI/AAAAAAAAAog/A8yPY7W7Yps/s1600-h/titlebar.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtBey09FIcI/AAAAAAAAAog/A8yPY7W7Yps/s320/titlebar.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d have picked a picture that didn&#8217;t make him look so much like Alfred E. Neuman, but then you&#8217;d be wrong&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtBg8U9FIdI/AAAAAAAAAoo/pcb0PnhBYUE/s1600-h/alfred+e+neuman.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtBg8U9FIdI/AAAAAAAAAoo/pcb0PnhBYUE/s320/alfred+e+neuman.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>But nowhere here there&#8217;s anything about what the President does, what he is supposed to do, or what are his duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Constitution gives a list of things the President can do: signing laws, vetoing bills, create a Cabinet, and (this one is special for Scooter Libby) grant reprieves and pardons. There are also some things he does with the advise and consent of the Senate: nominate ambassadors, judges, make treaties, etc.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also chief executive of the Executive Branch, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. The only thing it seems to me he is required to do, though, is take an oath of office (to uphold the Constitution) and to give an annual address to Congress about what he thinks is going on.</p>
<p>But people expect more than that from the President. Most people want him (or her) to take steps their lives better. This includes making the economy stronger and seeing to it the government provides services they desire. Heck, some people want the President to <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bal-op.contraception21aug21,0,7842827.story">outlaw most forms of birth control</a>.</p>
<p>And Presidential candidates clearly are willing to promise all these things. </p>
<p>So what is the role of the President? What should it be?</p>

                                <p>Some months ago, there was a bit of back and forth in magazines (and blogs) about whether or not Bill Clinton could run as VP on someone&#8217;s ticket, presumably with Hillary. The answer, of course, seems to be no &#8211; after all, he isn&#8217;t eligible to be President again.</p>
<p>But could he take another position in the line of succession? I imagine so. Moreover, my guess is that if Hillary were to become President, one of the wisest things she can do is make the Big Dog Secretary of State. He is widely admired abroad (i.e., he&#8217;s no Condi Rice), and he&#8217;d carry with him cachet at a level no Secretary of State has carried so far. Dealing with the Secretary of State of the US, rather than the President, would make other parties think of those negotiations as carrying a lot of importance with the US government (i.e., he&#8217;s no Condi Rice). Additionally, he was famous for doing his homework, reducing the odds of a screw-up (i.e., he&#8217;s no Condi Rice). Finally, of course, keeping him traveling and busy also keeps him away from spending time with the interns&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s important to understand that the Republican Party is mostly an organized conspiracy to redistribute wealth upwards, that deceit is an essential element of their M.O., that the conservative movement is fundamentally radical and dangerous, that the national media have done an abysmal job of covering politics and policy, and that the Bush administration has overturned the basic norms of governance that have prevailed for decades</p></blockquote>
<p>And the Amazon review states:</p>
<blockquote><p>This book traces the roots of his dislike back 30 years, when supply-side economics took over the Republican Party and made cutting taxes the GOP answer to all political and economic questions. American politics has been hijacked by a tiny coterie of right-wing economic extremists, Chait declares, some of them ideological zealots, others merely greedy, a few of them possibly insane. To which he adds, the Republicans&#8217; success at defeating the democratic process explains why it has been able to enact its agenda despite a lack of popular support. The rhetoric is inflammatory, but the case is laid out with clarity. Chait claims that traditional Republicans, religious people and social, fiscal and foreign policy conservatives have been cheated as much as liberals, and that unparalleled corruption and ruthless cynicism in Washington and the timidity of nonpartisan media allow the minority to rule. His analysis should appeal to anyone interested in politics, though many may find the style too irritating to endure.</p></blockquote>
<p>After all the irritating and insufferable stupidity from the practitioners of CrackpotEconomics, I’m rushing out to buy my copy of Mr. Chait’s books. A big thank you to Brad for bringing this book to our attention.</p>

<blockquote><p>If their calls for retreat gain no support from the electorate, perhaps they will change the subject to another of their favorite misconceptions, to wit, the economy is going to hell. Actually, the economy is chugging along in a healthy and protracted period of growth. For the past five years, per capita gross domestic product has grown at 11%. We are living through a vast global economic boom, and the Democrats seem completely unawares. In 2008 their presidential candidate will be moaning that we have lost a war and are economically in a hell of a mess. The Republican will only have to point to a healthy economy and the success of General Petraeus&#8217;s splendid army to win. Then the Democrats will whine that the Republicans stole the election from them. That is my prediction, and I base it on the evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>I did leave off most of his rant as to how we are winning the war in Iraq but we Democrats are just too stupid to recognize it.  After all, Cactus did ask:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why not adjust for inflation?</p></blockquote>
<p>Cactus was also trying to reproduce over what five-year period that nominal per capita GDP actually rose by 15 percent.  I’m not sure either but I did check the GDP deflator for 2007QII versus the GDP deflator for 20022QII using table1.1.9 of <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">this source</a>.  It would seem prices have risen by 15 percent over the past five years.  So real per capita GDP fell by about 4 percent and Mr. Tyrell is so unaware of the distinction between nominal income and real income that he thinks the economy is booming?  OK, Lawrence Kudlow makes the same mistake routinely.  The founder of the American Spectator is as stupid as those nitwits at the National Review!  Go figure!</p>

                                <p>A few days ago, I read <a href="http://newmarksdoor.typepad.com/mainblog/2007/08/r-emmett-tyrrel.html">this post</a> at Craig Newmark&#8217;s place and its been niggling at me ever since.  Craig links to an article in <a href="http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=11814">American Spectator by R. Emmett Tyrrell</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Actually, the economy is chugging along in a healthy and protracted period of growth. For the past five years, per capita gross domestic product has grown at 11%. We are living through a vast global economic boom, and the Democrats seem completely unawares. In 2008 their presidential candidate will be moaning that we have lost a war and are economically in a hell of a mess. The Republican will only have to point to a healthy economy and the success of General Petraeus&#8217;s splendid army to win. Then the Democrats will whine that the Republicans stole the election from them. That is my prediction, and I base it on the evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t dispute the very large possibility that the Dems will engage in some form of stupidity and lose the 2008 presidential election.  And with luck, both the economy and Iraq will look a bit better by next year.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t understand this statement at all: &#8220;per capita gross domestic product has grown at 11%.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave out the obvious questions&#8230; Why not adjust for inflation?  How does that compare to any other five year stretch?  Does the author&#8217;s first name also have a two or more sets of duplicate letters in a row?  No&#8230; my question is what does he mean?  That&#8217;s the percentage change over five years?  Annualized?  What is he talking about?</p>
<p>From line 1 of <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">NIPA Table 7.1</a>, we learn that GDP per capita (to use his measure) was  $35,476, in 2002 it was $36,296, in 2003 it was $37,626, in 2004 it was $39,735, in 2005 it was 41,869, and in 2006 it was $44,007.  </p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m missing something obvious, but I&#8217;ve played with the numbers two or three times over the past few days and I just can&#8217;t find that 11% over five years.  The best I can do&#8230; $44,007 (i.e., 2006&#8217;s value) is about 11% greater than $39,735 (2004&#8217;s value).  Similarly, the change from 2003 to 2005 is about 11%.  But that doesn&#8217;t strike me as what the guy means (especially since that relationship doesn&#8217;t hold for any other two year stretch involving GW.)</p>
<p>Someone tell me what I&#8217;m missing here.</p>

                                <p>Given the recent revisionism of the Vietnam War, I found this Op Ed by <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-brooks24aug24,1,7610339.column?ctrack=1&#038;cset=true">Rosa Brooks</a> to make a lot of sense&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>To Bush, the &#8220;unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America&#8217;s withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Bush went on to assert that &#8220;another price to our withdrawal from Vietnam&#8221; was the rise of &#8220;the enemy we face in today&#8217;s struggle, those who came to our soil and killed thousands of citizens&#8221; on 9/11.</p>
<p>Yup &#8212; it&#8217;s so obvious! The U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam caused the rise of Al Qaeda &#8212; and, by extension, &#8220;our withdrawal from Vietnam&#8221; ultimately turned Iraq into &#8220;the central front&#8221; in &#8220;the war on terror.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>How can we show the innocent civilians of Southeast Asia that we haven&#8217;t forgotten them and simultaneously send a message of resolve to the Iraqi people? How can we show Al Qaeda once and for all that the U.S. is not to be trifled with? &#8230;  Re-invade Vietnam.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_08_19_archive.html#110166006840654691">Post one</a> links to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/24/world/middleeast/24displaced.html?_r=2&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">this NY Times story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The number of Iraqis fleeing their homes has soared since the American troop increase began in February, according to data from two humanitarian groups, accelerating the partition of the country into sectarian enclaves.</p>
<p>Despite some evidence that the troop buildup has improved security in certain areas, sectarian violence continues and American-led operations have brought new fighting, driving fearful Iraqis from their homes at much higher rates than before the tens of thousands of additional troops arrived, the studies show.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Statistics collected by one of the two humanitarian groups, the Iraqi Red Crescent Organization, indicate that the total number of internally displaced Iraqis has more than doubled, to 1.1 million from 499,000, since the buildup started in February.</p>
<p>Those figures are broadly consistent with data compiled independently by an office in the United Nations that specializes in tracking wide-scale dislocations. That office, the International Organization for Migration, found that in recent months the rate of displacement in Baghdad, where the buildup is focused, had increased by as much as a factor of 20, although part of that rise could have stemmed from improved monitoring of displaced Iraqis by the government in Baghdad, the capital.</p>
<p>The new findings suggest that while sectarian attacks have declined in some neighborhoods, the influx of troops and the intense fighting they have brought are at least partly responsible for what a report by the United Nations migration office calls the worst human displacement in Iraq’s modern history.</p></blockquote>
<p>When the place is completely ethnically cleansed, the violence will decrease. And GW and the cheerleaders will claim vindication.</p>

<blockquote><p>By that I do not mean we, as America, are bigger or better than Iraq as a country. I mean that that sum of our national existence is not bound up in what happens there. The country will go on. Whatever happens, we&#8217;ll recover from it. And whatever might happen, there are things that matter much more to this country&#8217;s future &#8212; like whether we have a functioning military any more, whether our economy is wrecked, whether this country tears itself apart over this catastrophe. But we&#8217;ll go on and look back at this and judge what happened. </p>
<p>Not so for the president. For him, this is it. He&#8217;s not bigger than this. His entire legacy as president is bound up in Iraq. Which is another way of saying that his legacy is pretty clearly an irrecoverable shambles. That is why, as the folly of the enterprise becomes more clear, he must continually puff it up into more and more melodramatic and world-historical dimensions. A century long ideological struggle and the like. For the president a one in a thousand shot at some better outcome is well worth it, no matter what the cost. Because at least that&#8217;s a one in a thousand shot at not ending his presidency with the crushing verdict history now has in store. It&#8217;s also worth just letting things keep on going as they are forever because, like Micawber, something better might turn up. Going double or nothing by expanding the war into Iran might be worth it too for the same reason. For him, how can it get worse? </p>
<p>And when you boil all this down what it comes down to is that the president now has very different interests than the country he purports to lead. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A Canadian Doctor Describes How Socialized Medicine Doesn&#8217;t Work<br />By DAVID GRATZER | Posted Thursday, July 26, 2007 4:30 PM PT <br />I was once a believer in socialized medicine. As a Canadian, I had soaked up the belief that government-run health care was truly compassionate. What I knew about American health care was unappealing: high expenses and lots of uninsured people.</p>
<p>My health care prejudices crumbled on the way to a medical school class. On a subzero Winnipeg morning in 1997, I cut across the hospital emergency room to shave a few minutes off my frigid commute.</p>
<p>Swinging open the door, I stepped into a nightmare: the ER overflowed with elderly people on stretchers, waiting for admission. Some, it turned out, had waited five days. The air stank with sweat and urine. Right then, I began to reconsider everything that I thought I knew about Canadian health care.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Americans live 75.3 years on average, fewer than Canadians (77.3) or the French (76.6) or the citizens of any Western European nation save Portugal&#8230;&#8230; [but] In The Business of Health, Robert Ohsfeldt and John Schneider factor out intentional and unintentional injuries from life-expectancy statistics and find that Americans who don&#8217;t die in car crashes or homicides outlive people in any other Western country.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>And if we measure a health care system by how well it serves its sick citizens, American medicine excels. Five-year cancer survival rates bear this out. For leukemia, the American survival rate is almost 50%; the European rate is just 35%. Esophageal carcinoma: 12% in the U.S., 6% in Europe. The survival rate for prostate cancer is 81.2% here, yet 61.7% in France and down to 44.3% in England â€” a striking variation.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Like many critics of American health care, though, Krugman argues that the costs are just too high: health care spending in Canada and Britain, he notes, is a small fraction of what Americans pay. Again, the picture isn&#8217;t quite as clear as he suggests. Because the U.S. is so much wealthier than other countries, it isn&#8217;t unreasonable for it to spend more on health care. Take America&#8217;s high spending on research and development. M.D. Anderson in Texas, a prominent cancer center, spends more on research than Canada does.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are we throwing the baby out with the bathwater?</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/12639.html">Steve Benen</a>, <a href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/whats-off-the-record-at-nhtsa-almost-everything/">this story</a> in the NY Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want to know something as simple as who heads the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, don’t bother to ask the safety agency’s communications office. Without special permission, officials there are no longer allowed to provide information to reporters except on a background basis, which means it cannot be attributed to a spokesman. </p>
<p>Without such attribution, there are few circumstances under which most reporters will report such information. This makes for interesting dealings with the office charged with providing information about the nation’s top automotive safety agency.</p>
<p>So, I will end the suspense about the boss’s identity. The administrator is Nicole R. Nason, who took over on May 31, 2006, after she was appointed to the post by President Bush.</p>
<p>And it is she who put the big hush on one of the government’s most important safety agencies. I found this out recently when I asked to talk to an N.H.T.S.A. researcher about some technical safety issues in which he had a great deal of expertise. Agency officials told me I could talk to the expert on a background basis, but if I wanted to use any information or quotes from him, that would have to be worked out later with a N.H.T.S.A. official. The arrangement struck me as manipulative, and I declined to agree to it.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>As an alternative I was told I could interview Ms. Nason on the record (instead of the expert on the subject of my article). I declined, failing to see how her appointment as administrator — she was trained as a lawyer — made her a expert in that subject. </p>
<p>When I said I would like to talk to Ms. Nason on the record about her no-attribution policy, she was not available. </p>
<p>The agency’s new policy effectively means that some of the world’s top safety researchers are no longer allowed to talk to reporters or to be freely quoted about automotive safety issues that affect pretty much everybody.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The policy of allowing information to be attributed only to political appointees is intermittently enforced around other parts of the Department of Transportation, including the Federal Railroad Administration. But it is a radical change from the way N.H.T.S.A has operated for at least 20 years. In the past, reporters could talk to its experts and the agency was proud to discuss its research and accomplishments.</p>
<p>Ms. Nason felt it was necessary for N.H.T.S.A. to have a “central spokesperson” and “we were finding a lot of stuff did not need to be on the record,” David Kelly, her chief of staff, told me. He also insisted, after our telephone conversation, that he did not want to be quoted and had intended to speak only on background. (My notes show no such request.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Considering this is N.H.T.S.A., an agency that presumably isn&#8217;t all that heavily involved in National Security, but whose actions do affect the safety of all of us, the natural question is:  what are they hiding?</p>
