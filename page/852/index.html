                                <p>All else (including the size of government) equal, is a competent administration necessary for the well-functioning of the economy? (Put another way&#8230; is it a coincidence that the party that makes derogatory comments about government produces <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_19.html">poorer</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/healthcare-cost-increases-by-president.html">outcomes</a>, in general?)</p>
<p>I think competence matters.  People need to have faith in the system. They need stability to plan. A competent President can keep some things from going horribly wrong, and an incompetent one can make even routine things go poorly.  Its no coincidence that things have gone wrong in the GW administration.  Consider Katrina or Iraq or Afghanistan&#8230; would things have gone so poorly under Clinton?  And doesn&#8217;t that affect people&#8217;s economic decisions?</p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In commenting on the U.S. $63.9 billion trade deficit, <a href="http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_10010060.shtml">Professor Morici</a> makes a number of important observations:
<ol>
<li>Since December 2001, the monthly trade deficit has increased 140%</li>
<li>To finance trade deficits, Americas have borrowed $6 trillion over and above foreign direct investment in the U.S.</li>
<li>Petroleum, China, and automotive products account for 81% of the trade deficit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Petroleum: The result of a short-sighted policy on the part of both Democrats and Republicans.<br />China: A number of points here.
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Even though China has raised the value of the yuan about 5% every twelve months, the yuan remains undervalued against the dollar by at least 40%.&#8221;</li>
<li>By purchasing $250 billion in U.S. and foreign currency and securities, China &#8220;limits appreciation of the yuan against the dollar and drive it down against the euro. This comes to 24 percent of its exports,&#8221; creating a &#8220;24 percent &#8216;off-budget&#8217; subsidy on foreign sales of Chinese goods, and an even larger implicit tariff on Chinese imports.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Morici argues, and I agree, that China&#8217;s currency manipulation is a clear violation of WTO rules, as well as its numerous tax incentives, rebates, and low interest loans.</p>
<p>Why have the Bush administration and Congress not taken strong action? Why have so many turned a blind eye. Remember Schumer&#8217;s visit to China and his strong words? How long ago was that?</p>
<p>Well, what happened? Nada. Nothing. Zilch. Meanwhile, China is becoming increasingly more sophisticated and efficient, replacing brute labor with up-to-date plants. Again, why has the U.S. been reluctant to press its case, labeling anyone who speaks out as protectionist?</p>
<p>Morici hits the target when he says:<br />
<blockquote>Many U.S. multinationals corporations, like GE, Caterpillar and GM, have earned huge profits investing in China’s protected markets. Those MNCs have profited greatly from the conditions in China created by its blatant violations of WTO rules and currency subsidies; hence, it is not surprising they have lobbied the Congress and Administration not to take action against Chinese mercantilism and have persistently characterized as protectionist U.S. advocates for affirmative steps to offset China’s export subsidies. The Bush Administration has bent to these pressures, refusing to even acknowledge the subsidy on exports China’s currency market intervention creates, and has placed these corporate interests ahead of free trade principles.</p></blockquote>
<p>Morici should have added Delphi to his list. Our multinationals have decoupled from our economy.</p>
<p>If Schumer really wants a tariff on Chinese exports, I have a suggestion: Tariff only Chinese goods that U.S. firms export from China.  Leave the indigenous Chinese firms alone.  K Street, I bet, would go into overdrive on that suggestion.</p>
<p>Turning again to China, I would add that suppressing labor&#8217;s right to bargain collectively is also a subsidy. If the market place is to work, then labor&#8217;s rights should not be abridge, for labor is as much a part of the market place as capital.</p>
<p>But China is about to pass a &#8220;Contract Labor&#8221; law. I will be interested in seeing its final form.  Scuttlebutt has it that the multinationals have not been too happy with the draft form of the law, doing their best to gut it while maintaining good PR.</p>

<p>I’m paying almost $3.50 a gallon for gasoline here in Los Angeles right now so when <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2007/05/gas_prices_and.html">Bill Polley</a> raises the refinery issue, I definitely take notice.  Bill notes that <a href="http://wcco.com/goodquestion/local_story_128180811.html">WCCO-TV</a> blames a shortage of refineries:</p>
<blockquote><p>Average gas prices in the Twin Cities are flirting with $3 per gallon again. They have already topped that in other states and hit a new national average record of $3.07 per gallon. Experts said it&#8217;s a supply problem. We&#8217;re paying more because our refineries can&#8217;t pump out enough gas to meet our demand. So why don&#8217;t we just build more of them? &#8220;We&#8217;re dealing with the same spigot,&#8221; said Dr. Akshay Rao, a business professor at the University of Minnesota. He said the last refinery built in the United States was in 1976 and many have since closed. In fact, in 1985 there were 254 operating refineries. Today, there are approximately 142. &#8220;There were marginal refineries that weren&#8217;t making enough money closed,&#8221; said Rao. Existing refineries have been expanded and are actually producing record output. They process about 17 million barrels of oil each day, but Americans consume about 22 million. The difference is imported.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Rao starts with the declining number of refineries canard but then notes their output is up AND we can address shortages with imports.  Bill Polley notes that the decision to make a new refinery is a long-term investment decision so even if refinery margins have temporarily spiked, that’s not going to necessarily induce a surge in refinery investment.  </p>
<p>I tend to produce on occassion a time series based on <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gaspump.html">this data</a>, which alas goes only through March 2007.  My time series is deflated by the consumer price index such that the price-level is unity for the first quarter of 2005.  It shows that the relative price of gasoline had risen from $1.50 a gallon as of early 2000 to $2.50 as of March 2007 with peaks near $3 as of September 2005 and July 2006.  We also show the components of gasoline prices among the price of oil, the refinery margin, and “other” (taxes plus the distributor margin).  Much of the rise in gasoline prices from January 2000 to March 2007 is attributable to higher oil prices.  Refinery margins have been quite volatile but there does not appear to be a clear upward trend.  Now the current high prices might be to another jump in refinery margins, but I’m willing to bet that this is just another transitory event.  Which would mean that the incentives to do a lot of refinery investment just won’t be there.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>There are a few themes that I keep coming back to.  One is my frustration with governors such as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/governor-perrys-plan-to-privatize-texas.html">Rick Perry</a> selling the state’s income producing assets for a lump-sum below the present value of the future cash flows.  The other is how the modern Republican Party wants to spend and borrow rather to admit that spending means one has to raise taxes someday.  I have this problem with President Bush as well as the current governor of California.  I think Kevin Drum shares the same frustration with ARNOLD’s lack of leadership and basic fiscal dishonesty.  </p>
<p>And now <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_05/011280.php">Kevin</a> brings <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-lottery10may10,0,1542996.story?coll=la-home-center">this</a> to our attention:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is poised to call for privatizing the state lottery, a move that would bring California a cash infusion of as much as $37 billion to help solve pressing budget problems but also could sacrifice a major revenue source for decades to come. The lottery would be leased to a private company for up to 40 years in exchange for a lump-sum payment or series of payments</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once again, Arnold &#8220;We Have To Stop This Crazy Deficit Spending&#8221; Schwarzenegger is desperately trying to figure out a way to increase our deficit spending so that he can continue to pretend that he hasn&#8217;t raised taxes. That&#8217;s all this is about.  He&#8217;s already done this once with his deficit bonds, which will have to be repaid out of increased taxes eventually, and now, in order to make sure that &#8220;eventually&#8221; is sometime after he leaves office, he wants to raid the lottery to tide himself over. The result, of course, will be lower revenue in the future and therefore higher taxes. But not on his watch. Schwarzenegger may have a sunnier persona than George Bush, but the cynicism on offer here is even worse than Bush&#8217;s. Arnold knows perfectly well he&#8217;s raising taxes. He&#8217;s just hoping the rest of us are greedy enough to allow ourselves to be convinced otherwise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin is making the assumption that the present value of expected future cash flows from this lottery is greater than this $37 billion.  Using the same assumptions as to expected nominal increases in lottery payments and interest rates that I used in my discussion of the Texas lottery giveaway, ARNOLD’s deal is long-run neutral if the initial cash flow is $1.45 billion.  If it is higher than that – then Kevin is absolutely correct – this is a bad deal for the California taxpayer.  If so, we Californias need to get this big phony out of Sacramento ASAP.</p>

<blockquote><p>BAGHDAD &#8211; A sharp increase in mortar attacks on the Green Zone — the one-time oasis of security in Iraq&#8217;s turbulent capital — has prompted the U.S. Embassy to issue a strict new order telling all employees to wear flak vests and helmets while in unprotected buildings or whenever they are outside. </p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>The security deterioration also holds dire implications for the Iraqi government, which uses the Green Zone as a haven for key meetings crucial to its ability to govern. On Wednesday, for example, Vice President Dick Cheney held meetings in the Green Zone with Iraq&#8217;s prime minister.</p>
<p>Reporters covering the Cheney visit were hustled into a secure area when a large explosion rattled windows in the U.S. Embassy late in the afternoon. Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride said the vice president&#8217;s meeting &#8220;was not disturbed and he was not moved.&#8221;</p>
<p>The increase in mortar attacks comes despite the presence of tens of thousands more American and Iraqi soldiers in the streets of Baghdad as part of the security crackdown ordered by President Bush in January.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Because of the &#8220;recent increase of indirect fire attacks&#8221; — the military term for mortar and artillery barrages — the order told embassy employees that until further notice, &#8220;outdoor movement&#8221; must be &#8220;restricted to a minimum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Remain within a hardened structure to the maximum extent possible and strictly avoid congregating outdoors,&#8221; the order said.</p>
<p>Government employees who work outside of a &#8220;hardened structure&#8221; such as the current embassy building or travel &#8220;a substantial distance outdoors&#8221; must wear &#8220;personal protective equipment,&#8221; meaning flak jackets and helmets, the order said.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>But security has now become a prime topic of discussion among embassy staff. Many are increasingly worried and even glum — although few want to complain publicly, said the two American employees who spoke anonymously. </p>
<p>They are especially worried about their sleeping quarters in trailers on the current embassy compound — fearing that mortars could crash through the thin roofs as they sleep, the two said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mind you, this is the Green Zone. The best protected spot in all of Iraq. At this point, any idiot can tell things are not improving &#8211; except for the folks who wish ill upon Americans and ordinary Iraqis. If GW gets everything he wants from Congress, how much worse will things be in six months? In a year?</p>

                                <p>This is convocation season, and I have been spending time with healthcare experts from around the country. These are not economists (no offense intended) but the nuts-and-bolts people who keep the system running and who have the most informed opinions on policy, IMHO.</p>
<p>The “newest new thing” is <strong>Pay For Performance</strong>, known to many of us as “P4P.”  This is being championed by the feds within DHHS/CMS (Medicare and Medicaid). If successful, it would likely spread through the entire system.</p>
<p>P4P, an attempt to link quality with payment, raises a zillion questions, and those questions must be addressed before there is any large scale roll out. A full list would be way too long, but here are a few. The intent is better quality while holding the line on costs (or at least slowing the escalation). So&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>How do we define quality, how do we measure quality?</p>
<p>How do we fund and build the extensive IT network necessary?  (#1 problem, in my opinion)</p>
<p>Do we focus on certain conditions (diabetes, asthma, COPD, osteoarthritis) or attack everything? If focused, how do we choose?</p>
<p>How do we account for non-compliant patients? (another huge problem)</p>
<p>How do we factor in geriatric patients, who are not going to markedly improve? What quality measures do we use?</p>
<p>How do we reconfigure regulatory barriers (federal regulations in particular, such as Stark I and II, CMP, anti-kickback, anti-trust, etc.) that prohibit the kind of doctor-hospital collaboration we would need to make the system work?</p>
<p>How do we reform malpractice, which is a major healthcare cost driver?</p>
<p>This may seem like a lot of technical gibberish, but it is where real reform of healthcare will likely occur. Question is, how do we get providers to buy in, and how do we get taxpayers to pay for the infrastructure to support this system?  And then, will it work?</p>
<p>Is this the correct approach, or do we need something more radical? Or do we need to combine multiple concepts?  Your thoughts?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The more time goes on, the fewer individual accomplishments of each President get remembered. I would imagine that at this point, most US history books, if they discussed Jimmy Carter at all, probably will discuss his term term briefly in terms of the following blurbs:</p>
<p>1. stagflation<br />2. started process of deregulation<br />3. Iranian hostage crisis</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe there&#8217;s something about Arabs and Israelis thrown in.</p>
<p>Continuing our broad strokes look at recent presidencies, in a few more years, Reagan will be just:</p>
<p>1. End of stagflation / morning in America<br />2. Tax cuts<br />3. Deficits as far as the eye could see<br />4. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall<br />5. Iran Contra</p>
<p>GHW won&#8217;t really have much. I imagine he&#8217;ll be thought of, rightly or wrongly, as Reagan&#8217;s third term. He raised taxes slightly but by so little it won&#8217;t get a mention. The Soviet Union fell during his term, but nobody really associates GHW as having anything to do with it, or it affecting his administration in a large way. In a few decades, about the only mention of GHW might be the Gulf War.</p>
<p>What about Clinton:</p>
<p>1. Raised taxes<br />2. Ran surpluses</p>
<p>I imagine two events that happened during his term will get tied to him in some way: Oklahoma City Bombing and the stock market bubble (not that all of it was a bubble). </p>
<p>So what will GW&#8217;s term be remembered for?</p>
<p>1. WTC<br />2. Afghanistan<br />3. Iraq<br />4. Katrina<br />5. Return of fiscal irresponsibility</p>
<p>That last one might get tied to an economic slowdown and/or housing bubble should the either become a very large problem. A scandal or two (US Attorneys perhaps) might get attached, and its certainly not too late for something else to spiral horribly out of control, Katrina-style. And none of the items on the list look like they&#8217;re going to be portrayed in a way that is flattering toward GW.  And I can&#8217;t think of anything big that will portray GW in a positive light.</p>
<p>But am I missing something? Is there anything big for which GW is going to be remembered well?</p>

                                <p>This one is also by Dan, who quotes:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Earlier this year, Venezuela and Argentina <a href="http://www.alternet.org/blogs/peek/51662/#more">launched the new &#8220;Banco del Sur&#8221;</a> (Bank of the South), pledging more than $ 1 billion to get the institution up and running in the next few months. Although the details are currently being worked out (a 90-day deadline has been established to define some basic operating rules) several other countries have agreed to join: Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay will also be founding members. Additionally, Nicaragua, several Caribbean countries and even a few Asian nations have expressed interest in participating in the new multilateral institution.</p>
<p>The Bank of the South’s creation underscores the severity of the disenchantment with the traditional U.S.-dominated instruments for development finance. From the World Bank to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) (which provides financing exclusively in Latin America and the Caribbean), voting privileges are based on financial contribution, which makes the U.S. Treasury the single largest shareholder, bringing with it the largest share of the vote. In the IDB, the U.S. not only “owns” a whopping 30 percent of the vote, but it also holds veto power—an advantage to which no other member is privy.</p>
<p>In a clear departure from this undemocratic and paternalistic governance structure, Banco del Sur promoters assure, as Cabezas has said, that in the new institution “no one will be the sole owner.” Although not fully defined, there has been indication that voting power will be based on financial need, rather than monetary contribution or political weight. But beyond the critical structural and political delineation, the real challenge will be to create an institution that does not only look different than its predecessors but that it actually thinks and acts differently. This means that member countries will need to think long and hard about how development will be defined and how it will best be achieved.</p></blockquote>
<p>This item came to my attention and certainly adds a dimension to the post on the WTO GATS, IMF, and IADP loan schemes currently affecting water and other commodity resources.  It seems to me there is a battle to determine rules of the market that will affect everyone.  Water, oil, food.</p>

                                <p>GWU&#8217;s National Security Archive compiles a lot of information as it becomes public and makes it available online. Sometimes you have to wait quite a while -decades &#8211; before information becomes declassified, sometimes stuff is available quickly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB219/index.htm#timeline">They just released the following</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>In January 2003 Defense Department planners recommended the creation of a &#8220;Rapid Reaction Media Team&#8221; to serve as a bridge between Iraq&#8217;s formerly state-controlled news outlets and an &#8220;Iraqi Free Media&#8221; network, according to a White Paper and PowerPoint slides that were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and are posted today on the Web by the National Security Archive.</p>
<p>The Pentagon team would portray a &#8220;new Iraq&#8221; offering hope of a prosperous and democratic future, which would serve as a model for the Middle East. American, British, and Iraqi media experts would be hand-picked to provide &#8220;approved USG information&#8221; for the Iraqi public, while an ensuing &#8220;strategic information campaign&#8221; would be part of a &#8220;likely 1-2 years . . . transition&#8221; to a representative government. A new weekly Iraqi newspaper would feature &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; along with the news.</p>
<p>Defense Department planners envisioned a post-invasion Iraq where the U.S., in cooperation with a friendly Baghdad government, could monopolize information dissemination. They did not account for independent media outlets, the Internet, and all the other alternative sources of information that are available in the modern world. The U.S. media campaign has not been able to control the message &#8211; but its execution was privatized, and contracting has made it a profitable enterprise for those able to capitalize on the Pentagon&#8217;s largesse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Information warfare is nothing new. But like many other things, it seems to me that this administration has, in practice,done things a bit differently than they have been done in the past, at least in the US.</p>
<p>Consider&#8230; for the past few years, despite obvious evidence to the contrary, the administration kept insisting that all was well in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the MSM bought into it. (The MSM is still pretty convinced that things are going well in Afghanistan.) But who was this intended to fool? The Iraqis? By June of last year, how many Iraqis could possibly have failed to notice the condition that Iraq was in. But there were still a lot of Americans that still hadn&#8217;t accepted reality, and there&#8217;s still a core 30% that apparently still won&#8217;t. </p>
<p>Put another way&#8230; this information strategy has targeted Americans, not Iraqis. And for a long time, it worked very well.  </p>
<p>I wonder how Arabs felt in 1967 when they discovered that not only were they not &#8220;pushing the Jews into the sea&#8221;, their armies were actually losing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/51624/">Alternet</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Tuesday, without note in the U.S. media, more than half of the members of Iraq&#8217;s parliament rejected the continuing occupation of their country. 144 lawmakers signed onto a legislative petition calling on the United States to set a timetable for withdrawal, according to Nassar Al-Rubaie, a spokesman for the Al Sadr movement, the nationalist Shia group that sponsored the petition.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a hugely significant development. Lawmakers demanding an end to the occupation now have the upper hand in the Iraqi legislature for the first time; previous attempts at a similar resolution fell just short of the 138 votes needed to pass (there are 275 members of the Iraqi parliament, but many have fled the country&#8217;s civil conflict, and at times it&#8217;s been difficult to arrive at a quorum).</p></blockquote>
<p>I say it again…we, the US, do not have control. And the press isn&#8217;t big on covering on that.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Update (by cactus).  In the comments section, two readers (sammy and CoRev) and our resident troll (I&#8217;m not sure he&#8217;s really &#8220;our&#8221; troll since he also lurks at some other sites indicate that the story may not be believable.  Sammy and CoRev because the story wasn&#8217;t reported anywhere but AlterNet.  The troll, well, because the troll doesn&#8217;t to believe.  </p>
<p>Reader mestes points out that the International Herald Tribune is now <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/10/africa/ME-GEN-Iraq-Politics.php">reporting the same thing</a>.</p>
