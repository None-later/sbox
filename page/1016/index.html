                                                                    </div>

                                <p>In <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/would-redistricting-really-cost.html">my earlier post</a> I made the argument that, whatever its other drawbacks and merits, the California redistricting proposal is unlikely to cost the Democrats seats, and may actually win them some additional ones.  My reasoning, in brief, is that Democratic voters are already so highly concentrated into safe Democratic seats that redistricting can only have the effect of dispersing them, and thus giving Democratic candidates more chances to win additional seats.</p>
<p>The table that I presented in the previous post contained some <em>prima facie</em> evidence for my argument, because it showed that the majority of Democratic seats are extremely safe, while the majority of Republican seats are only won by comfortable, but not overwhelming margins.  </p>
<p>While this evidence is strongly suggestive, it may not be completely convincing, however; if geographic boundaries (such as cities, counties, etc.) contain even higher concentrations of Democratic voters than current Democratic districts, then redistricting by geography could lead to even greater concentration of Democratic voters and thus a loss in the number of Democratic seats.</p>
<p>It turns out that this is not the case, however.  The following table shows voter registration for the largest counties and cities in California in September 2004, and the advantage in party registration enjoyed by Democrats in each district (a &#8216;+&#8217; indicates more registered Democrats, while a &#8216;-&#8216; indicates more registered Republicans).  </p>

<p>While there are several counties and cities with high concentrations of Democratic voters, rarely does the concentration of Dem. voters in these geographic districts match the extraordinary Dem. concentration in current Congressional districts &#8211; where 7 seats were won by 60 point margins, and 19 seats were won by 40 point margins.  If Congressional districts were organized by city and town, a few districts might have winning margins of 40 points (and maybe one or two would even have margins of 60 points), but certainly fewer districts than the current 19 would be so lopsided.</p>
<p>This means that organizing Congressional districts by cities and counties will almost certainly end up dispersing the Democratic vote among more districts.  And that in turn will mean that Democrats will almost certainly not lose seats, and may in fact gain some.</p>

                                <p>Writing in the Lowell Sun, Dan O&#8217;Brien <a href="http://www.lowellsun.com/business/ci_3188959">reports</a> that a number of towns in Middlesex County are reporting year-over-year median price declines. O&#8217;Brien provides details for Dracut and Lowell, and then writes:<br />
<blockquote>Other Middlesex County communities showing year-over-year price drops (among those with at least 20 sales) include Arlington, Hopkinton, Hudson, Lexington, Natick, Newton, Reading and Weston.</p>
<p>&#8230;we haven&#8217;t seen year-over-year declines in a long time. Throw in higher interest rates &#8212; the average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.31 percent this past week, still historically low, but the highest in four years. Then add record inventories, sluggish job growth (and with it, almost non-existent wage growth) and higher energy prices.<br />&#8230;<br />Does this mean the sky is falling? That prices are set to plunge like in the early &#8217;90s? No. But there comes a point where prices simply outrun the income levels of new buyers, no matter how exotic the lending gets.</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, we appear to be there.</p>
<p>So the message is clear: This market is getting tired.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the early &#8217;90s, the Boston area was the first boom area with declining prices. Nominal house prices peaked in Boston in late 1989, about one year earlier than San Diego. The following graph shows nominal prices in Boston, San Diego and US in the early &#8217;90s. (Dec, 1986 = 100)</p>

<p>In real terms, in the early &#8217;90s, Boston led the US and San Diego price declines by about one year.</p>

<p>The Boston area has substantially more inventory than most of the country.  In July, the <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/07/housing-boston-is-looking-peaked.html">supply of existing homes</a> reached 8.8 months in Massachusetts.  Nationwide existing home supplies are about 4.7 months, so its no surprise that Boston is one of the first bubble areas to see house price declines.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/05/AR2005110501343_2.html">Washington Post</a> notes that both of the major initiatives to reorganize the way in which Congressional districts are drawn up, one in Ohio and one in California, look headed for defeat.  In both states it seems likely that partisan gerrymandering will remain the process by which Congressional boundaries are drawn in those states.  A lot of Democrats will be happy about the result, at least in CA.  But not me.</p>
<p>The argument made by many Democrats is that the CA redistricting proposal would almost certainly result in fewer Democratic districts, and should thus be opposed. <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_10/007351.php">Kevin Drum</a> recently noted one such analysis (in this case by <a href="http://plumer.blogspot.com/2005_10_01_plumer_archive.html#112950845034870389">Brad Plumer</a>) of why Democrats would likely lose seats in the proposed redistricting.   </p>
<p>But even though Plumer&#8217;s reasoning makes theoretical sense in the abstract, I&#8217;m not convinced that his conclusion that the Democrats will lose seats is correct, given the reality of current district boundaries in California.</p>
<p>Consider the following table.  It shows the number of Democratic and Republican seats in Ohio and California, by degree of competitiveness in 2004.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/redistrict4.JPG"></p>
<p>Ohio clearly shows the telltale signs of partisan gerrymandering.  Huge numbers of Democratic voters are packed into a few extremely safe Dem districts (winning margins of 40+ points), while Republican voters are spread around into a large number of districts that have what I will call the &#8220;ideal winning margin&#8221;, at least from a Republican gerrymander point of view: winning margins in the neighborhood of 10 to 30 points, which leave the seat reasonably reliable, but without wasted partisan votes.  That&#8217;s why a state that voted roughly 50-50 in the last election sent a delegation of 12R, 6D to Congress.</p>
<p>Now look at California.  Interestingly, the effects of the gerrymander in CA look rather similar to OH.  The Republicans actually have more districts with the &#8220;ideal winning margin&#8221; than Democrats.  And Democrats have a huge number of seats that are overwhelmingly Democratic &#8211; which essentially means that they contain lots of wasted Democratic votes.</p>
<p>This suggests two things to me.  First, the gerrymander of 2001 in CA was not a particularly good one from the Democratic party&#8217;s point of view.  If the Democrats had done a really successful gerrymander, Democratic voters would be spread among more districts that they could win by 10 to 30 points, not concentrated into a number of super-Democratic districts. </p>
<p>But secondly, it suggests to me that non-partisan redistricting probably won&#8217;t result in a large net loss in Democratic seats, and might even result in a gain.  Why not?  Because <strong>the redistricting would only result in fewer Democratic seats if Democratic voters in CA end up more intensely concentrated they already are</strong>.  But given the fact that the 2001 gerrymander has already packed many Democratic voters in CA into a number of super-Democratic seats (7 of those Dem seats were won by more than <strong>60</strong> points in 2004, by the way), it seems highly unlikely that any new scheme could make that problem even worse.  If anything, it seems much more likely that non-partisan redistricting will spread Democratic voters out a bit more than they currently are.  In other words, there&#8217;s pretty much only one way to go from here.</p>
<p>The question of whether or not the Democrats gain or lose seats in CA is actually of secondary importance to me, however.  There are two other important reasons that I would vote for the proposal, if I lived in CA.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s the general principle of the thing.  This is what led the liberal advocacy group <a href="http://calpirg.org/CA.asp?id2=19766">CalPirg</a>, as well as several leading California newspapers, to endorse the proposition.</p>
<p>Secondly, this seems like a wasted chance for the Democratic party to take a positive stand on principle, as <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/10/15/235512/73">Kos</a> has pointed out.  By opposing non-partisan redistricting in CA while supporting it in OH, the Democratic party has missed an easy opportunity to distinguish itself from the Republican party by adhering to a general principle &#8211; in this case, that gerrymandered districts distort the democratic process &#8211; instead of simply calculating the chances of narrow partisan gain or loss in each state.</p>
<p>Given these latter points, I think that Democrats should support the measure even at the cost of a couple of seats in CA.  But it&#8217;s not at all clear that that would happen.  It would be particularly sad and ironic if Democrats vote against the redistricting proposal because they think it will cost the Democratic party some Congressional seats, when it may well do the opposite.</p>
<p>Kash</p>
<p>UPDATE: For more data that shows why defining Congressional districts by county or city boundaries would probably disperse, not concentrate, Democratic voters relative to where they are today, see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/california-redistricting-part-ii.html">California Redistricting, Part II</a>.  </p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200511040835.asp">Michael Darda</a> tries very hard to pack a lot of wisdom into an NRO op-ed but he writes too much:<br />
<blockquote>Consumer spending is driven by income growth, which is the function of employment, the capital-to-labor ratio, productivity, and wage and salary rates. These trends remain sound. So we can expect consumer spending to expand at a respectable pace as long as income growth holds up, household net worth remains in positive year-to-year territory, and the level of real short-term interest rates doesn’t climb significantly above historical averages with respect to core inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, productivity growth remains strong but he might wish to check with <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/productivity-and-compensation.html">Kash</a> on wages and employment.  Given the concern about the Federal Reserve adopting tight monetary policy, we should check <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data/m/tci10y.txt">here</a> and note that real interest rates indeed have remained low – so far. </p>
<p>But Darda loses it when he tries to argue that national savings is high:<br />
<blockquote>The argument that there is no intrinsic savings in the U.S. also is a myth. Narrow measures of savings, such as the difference between personal income and personal spending, leave out many relevant household resources that could be tapped in times of need. Household net worth (total household assets less total household liabilities) has risen to a record $50 trillion. The ratio of financial assets (which excludes housing but not savings accounts or equities) is 3.6 times the level of personal income, slightly higher than the post WWI average of 3.2 times. What’s more, gross private savings, which includes both the household and corporate sectors, was 13.7 percent of GDP as of the second quarter (the last period for which data is available). While this is below historical norms, it is above the 13.6 percent average rate during the year 2000 when the U.S. enjoyed a fiscal surplus of 2.5 percent of GDP.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gross private savings are low and I trust Darda knows that national savings is the sum of private savings and the government surplus.  If he does not, the following graph of gross savings (GS) relative to GDP might illustrate.  GS is defined simply as GDP minus consumption minus government purchases, which were around 14% of GDP in 2000 and fell to around 10% of GDP in 2003.  Of course, gross savings fails to deduct for depreciation, which is almost 10% of national income.  <br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/darda-755104.JPG"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/darda-751257.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I prefer some sort of net savings measure such as the time series provided by <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/07/should_we_worry.html">James Hamilton</a>.  As his graph show, most of our recent net investment has been financed by borrowing from abroad, which means we are saving very little.</p>
<p>As far as the Kudlow-Malpass-Tamny definition of savings, it is truly amazing that we have to keep <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/kudlow-malpass-tamny-definition-of.html">repeating</a> the point about real per capita wealth, which is still below the level in late 1999.  </p>
<p>But there is another thing I don’t get about the free lunch crowd – don’t they understand that as consumption rises relative to income, this means savings declines?  Do they teach budget constraints at the economics department of National Review University or have they repealed the law of scarcity?</p>

In addition to a cool illustration of the wingnuts, Max writes:<br />
<blockquote>They are also crying because the Commission did not use &#8220;dynamic scoring.&#8221; This would have allowed the Commission to present revenue-losing/deficit-increasing proposals under the guise of fiscal responsibility.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/03/AR2005110301970.html">Tom DeLay</a> has taken to imitating Ross Perot:<br />
<blockquote>In case you were wondering what that giant &#8220;whoosh&#8221; emanating from Washington was, it was the sound of the people on the President&#8217;s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform swinging and missing at the easy underhand toss that George W. Bush sent their way.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/novak/cst-edt-novak03.html">Robert Novak</a> writes:<br />
<blockquote>George W. Bush&#8217;s chances of engaging the country with a dynamic second-term initiative were sabotaged this week … Even John Maynard Keynes, no supply-sider, said 25 percent is the highest acceptable rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems Novak wants to get “dynamic” and “supply-side” in his writings in every irrelevant way possible – but I missed the thesis from Keynes that declared a tax rate above 25% as being unacceptable.  </p>
<p>But let’s suppose that we decided to incorporate “dynamic scoring” to the GOP agenda of fiscal irresponsibility.  In other words, suppose we modeled out the impact of long-term growth from the GOP’s desire to increase government spending combined with having our children foot the deferred tax bill.  With George W. Bush’s desire to “give us money back” so we can consume more combined with the increases in government purchases, one would think that Nobel Prize winning Dr. Novak (well in his mind, he is the best economist ever) would realize that the reduction in national savings would equate to less long-term growth.  So why don’t we make a deal with the free lunch supply-side camp – adopt dynamic scoring with the caveat that we get the sign right.</p>

From Froomkin&#8217;s transcript: <br />
<blockquote>Mr. WILKERSON: I&#8217;m privy to the paperwork, both classified and unclassified, that the secretary of State asked me to assemble on how this all got started, what the audit trail was, and when I began to assemble this paperwork, which I no longer have access to, it was clear to me that there was a visible audit trail from the vice president&#8217;s office through the secretary of Defense down to the commanders in the field that in carefully couched terms &#8212; I&#8217;ll give you that &#8212; that to a soldier in the field meant two things: We&#8217;re not getting enough good intelligence and you need to get that evidence, and, oh, by the way, here&#8217;s some ways you probably can get it. And even some of the ways that they detailed were not in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Conventions and the law of war.</p></blockquote>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens if any other news outlets actually pick up on this story.</p>
<p>Kash</p>
<p>UPDATE: In case any reporters feel like running with this (potentially explosive) story, here are a couple of interesting angles that could be pursued:</p>
<p>&#8211; In an interesting coincidence, this news comes the same day that Cheney visited Capitol Hill to lobby for a <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1151AP_Cheney_Torture.html">CIA exemption from anti-torture rules</a>;<br />&#8211; This news suggests that the Vice President circumvented or superceded a Presidential order;<br />&#8211; In another interesting coincidence, this news comes just three days after Cheney appointed David Addington to be his chief of staff; Addington was the one who developed the legal rationale in the Vice President&#8217;s office for this policy, according to Wilkerson.</p>
<p>Just some suggestions.</p>

<blockquote>MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan &#8211; President Gen. Pervez Musharraf suspended a major purchase of U.S. fighter planes, saying Friday during a tour of this devastated city that funds are needed first and foremost for earthquake recovery. </p>
<p>The president — who has been criticized for refusing to cut the nation&#8217;s enormous military budget in light of the disaster — called on the world to send more money, saying the response to the killer quake has fallen far short of that for last year&#8217;s tsunami or Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>Musharraf said he was delaying the purchase of 77 F-16 fighters because of the need for rebuilding large swaths of northern Pakistan flattened by the Oct. 8 temblor, which killed about 80,000 people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note the contrast:</p>
<p><strong>The government of Pakistan</strong>, when faced with the tremendous costs of a terrible disaster, makes some painful decisions and sacrifices in order to help pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>The government of the US</strong>, when faced with the tremendous costs of a terrible disaster, passes the bill along to its youngest children.</p>
<p>Kash</p>
<p>p.s. Note as well that there is no excuse &#8211; <strong>none</strong> &#8211; for the failure of the developed world to provide more assistance to one of the world&#8217;s poorest countries, Pakistan, which is almost single-handedly dealing with one of the greatest disasters the world has seen in recent years.  Individuals who wish to help <a href="http://donate.ifrc.org/">can still do so</a>.</p>

So was I, so let’s check the news from the household survey.  First of all, the household survey indicates employment fell by 17 thousand in September but then increased by 214 thousand last month – for a two-month net increase of 197,000.  The dip in the recorded employment-to-population from 62.9% in August to 62.8% in September was reversed with the ratio being 62.9% in October.  I guess we’ll Jack Snow flipping back to emphasizing the household survey again.</p>
<p>We should also note that the labor force participation rate fell from 66.2% to 66.1%.  Now is that a discouraged worker effect or individuals choosing to take more leisure time?</p>

<p>In fact, when one considers the fact that in recent months the construction industry has single-handedly been responsible for a large share of the net new job creation, it looks like this is the third consecutive month of weakness in the non-construction job market.  The following chart illustrates.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/job_creation1.jpg"></p>
<p>The period shown in the graph corresponds to what may well be the strongest economic growth of this business cycle.  As a bit of context, note that during the six years of economic boom between 1995-2000, the <em><strong>average</strong></em> net job creation in the private sector was about 208,000 per month, with 10% of that job growth coming from construction.  So far in 2005 the corresponding numbers are 144,000 and 16%.</p>
<p>Of course, it is possible that the numbers for the past three months were all negatively affected by various hurricanes, and so this may not be the start of a trend at all.  But at some point one has to wonder&#8230; particularly since these signs of job market weakness correspond uncomfortably well with some tentative signs that the growth in the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/slowing-growth.html">personal income</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/productivity-and-compensation.html">compensation</a> slowed during the same period.</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_11/007490.php">Via CalPundit</a>, this <a href="http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/000682.html">Bush vs. Nixon</a> closeup.
