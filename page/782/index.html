<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/10/war-on-the-chea.html">Mark Thoma</a> follows up on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/paying-for-war-thomas-friedman-is.html">this discussion</a> with a post called <em>War on the Cheap</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>here&#8217;s a way the costs are being reduced: by making sure soldiers who served in Iraq are not eligible for education benefits after they return. This is not how we should be saving money or treating our soldiers.</p></blockquote>
<p>And we were complaining that Bush vetoed SCHIP!  So George W. Bush limits his fiscal conservatism to screw the kids of the working poor and screw the troops.  But look – the amount of savings from these two large cuts in small programs (as Max Sawicky might call this) are a drop in the bucket to the General Fund deficit.  Looking at table B-78 from <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/eop/tables07.html">this source</a>, it seems that Bush’s own economists believe that total Federal debt will exceed $9 trillion by the end of this fiscal year, which translates into a deficit of $556 billion for the year.  OK, they projected a much small rise in the debt held by the public as the surpluses of the Trust Funds was projected to be around $300 billion.  Their projection for fiscal year ending October 31, 2008 looks even worse. OK, we know they’ve overestimated these things before to declare some sort of great improvement when the actual increase turned out less than their phony forecasts.  Nonetheless, the General Fund is still huge and all this garbage about an improving unified deficit is nothing more than the rising Social Security surpluses. </p>
<p>I think it’s time to go big picture as to how much the government purchases and where we raise taxes.  Our first graph shows defense spending (Def) non-defense Federal purchases (NonDef) and state &#038; local government purchases (SL).  Back in the last year of that leftwing high tax Clinton bad old days, total government purchases were 17.5% of GDP.   As of 2007QII, the fiscal responsible George W. Bush made sure we only spent 19.4% of GDP on total government purchases.  OK – we had do that stupid war in Iraq so the fact that defense spending went from 3.75% of GDP to 4.75% of GDP is no surprise.  Non-defense Federal purchases actually went up – a bit.  But then non-defense Federal purchases are only 2.3% of GDP.  The state &#038; locals, however, have seen their purchases rise from 11.7% of GDP to 12.3% of GDP.  Yes, we do want our schools, our police and fire protection, and our roads maintained. I don’t see anyone in the Republican Party suggesting any significant reduction in government purchases as most of these fellows are wedded to Endless War.</p>
<p>Our second graph breaks up what we spend in taxes between Federal income taxes, Federal payroll taxes, and taxes paid to the state &#038; locals.  In 2006, they totaled 32% of GDP – which does sounds like a lot.  Of course, their total was almost 34% of GDP back in 2000.  So what happened?  Well, the state &#038; locals still have their take at almost 13.5% of GDP &#8211; while our payroll taxes, which are supposed to be contributions to our Social Security retirement benefits – are still around 7% of GDP.  What happened was a big dip in what we paid in terms of Federal income taxes followed by only a partial recovery.  While we used to pay as much as Federal income taxes as we paid to the state &#038; locals, last year Federal income taxes were only 11.7% of GDP.  </p>
<p>Now I know the rightwing excuse makers are ready to pounce with their supply-side stupidity so let me point that real GDP as of 2007QII was a mere 16.52% greater than it was as of 2000QIV.  Hmm – population grew by 6.55% over this period.  The 9.35% increase in per capita income is less than 1.4% per year.  Not exactly a great performance.  </p>
<p>So how do we return to fiscal sanity if we are stuck with Endless War and this GOP fear of raising taxes?  You might say – cut entitlements.  That seems to be the GOP mantra these days.  But George W. Bush has increased entitlements with his bloated Prescription Drug Benefit that he loves to brag about in the same breathe he says he cut taxes.  The only large pot of cash that seems to be left is those Social Security benefits that we thought we were paying payroll contributions for.  Every time this GOP crew talks about Social Security “reform” – hold onto your wallet.  You might think they were talking about the sensible stuff we see from <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/10/guide-to-posts-on-social-security.html">Andrew Samwick</a> but if that’s all they are going to do, the total Federal debt will continue to rise relative to GDP.  No I suspect their real game plan is to slash your benefits but leave those payroll taxes quite high.  Or maybe they’ll pass the buck to the state &#038; locals so regressive sales taxes will have to be raised. </p>
<p>Now I began this by asking a question to Dana Perino, but I should know better.  She’ll never give an honest and intelligent answer to this question.  After all, she works for George W. Bush.  So might I get a straight answer from the Siamese triplet known as Rudy McRomney or its clone – Fred Thompson?  I’m not holding my breathe waiting for it.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_alarming_parallels_between_1929_and_2007">American Prospect</a> has published an article by Robert Kuttner on parallels between 1929 and 2007.</p>
<blockquote><p>In researching the book, I devoted a lot of effort to reviewing the abuses of the 1920s, the effort in the 1930s to create a financial system that would prevent repetition of those abuses, and the steady dismantling of the safeguards over the last three decades in the name of free markets and financial innovation.<br />Your predecessors on the Senate Banking Committee, in the celebrated Pecora Hearings of 1933 and 1934, laid the groundwork for the modern edifice of financial regulation. I suspect that they would be appalled at the parallels between the systemic risks of the 1920s and many of the modern practices that have been permitted to seep back in to our financial markets.<br /><em><strong>Although the particulars are different</strong></em>, my reading of financial history suggests that the abuses and risks are all too similar and enduring. When you strip them down to their essence, they are variations on a few hardy perennials &#8211;<em> excessive leveraging, misrepresentation, insider conflicts of interest, non-transparency, and the triumph of engineered euphoria over evidence</em>.<br />The most basic and alarming parallel is the <strong>creation of asset bubbles</strong>, in which the purveyors of securities use very high leverage; the securities are sold to the public or to specialized funds with underlying collateral of uncertain value; and financial middlemen extract exorbitant returns at the expense of the real economy. This was the essence of the abuse of public utilities stock pyramids in the 1920s, where multi-layered holding companies allowed securities to be watered down, to the point where the real collateral was worth just a few cents on the dollar, and returns were diverted from operating companies and ratepayers. This only became exposed when the bubble burst. As Warren Buffett famously put it, you never know who is swimming naked until the tide goes out.<br />There is good evidence &#8211; and I will add to the record a paper on this subject by the Federal Reserve staff economists Dean Maki and Michael Palumbo &#8211; that even much of the boom of the late 1990s was built substantially on asset bubbles. [&#8220;Disentangling the Wealth Effect: a Cohort Analysis of Household Savings in the 1990s&#8221;]<br />A second parallel is what today <strong>we would call securitization of credit</strong>. Some people think this is a recent innovation, but in fact it was the core technique that made possible the dangerous practices of the 1920. Banks would originate and repackage highly speculative loans, market them as securities through their retail networks, using the prestigious brand name of the bank &#8211; e.g. Morgan or Chase &#8211; as a proxy for the soundness of the security. It was this practice, and the ensuing collapse when so much of the paper went bad, that led Congress to enact the Glass-Steagall Act, requiring bankers to decide either to be commercial banks &#8211; part of the monetary system, closely supervised and subject to reserve requirements, given deposit insurance, and access to the Fed&#8217;s discount window; or investment banks that were not government guaranteed, but that were soon subjected to an extensive disclosure regime under the SEC.<br />Since repeal of Glass Steagall in 1999, after more than a decade of de facto inroads, super-banks have been able to re-enact the same kinds of structural conflicts of interest that were endemic in the 1920s &#8211; lending to speculators, packaging and securitizing credits and then selling them off, wholesale or retail, and extracting fees at every step along the way. And, much of this paper is even more opaque to bank examiners than its counterparts were in the 1920s. Much of it isn&#8217;t paper at all, and the whole process is supercharged by computers and automated formulas. An independent source of instability is that while these credit derivatives are said to increase liquidity and serve as shock absorbers, in fact their bets are often in the same direction &#8211; assuming perpetually rising asset prices &#8211; so in a credit crisis they can act as net de-stabilizers.<br />A third parallel is the<strong> excessive use of leverage</strong>. In the 1920s, not only were there pervasive stock-watering schemes, but there was no limit on margin. If you thought the market was just going up forever, you could borrow most of the cost of your investment, via loans conveniently provided by your stockbroker. It worked well on the upside. When it didn&#8217;t work so well on the downside, Congress subsequently imposed margin limits. But anybody who knows anything about derivatives or hedge funds knows that margin limits are for little people. High rollers, with credit derivatives, can use leverage at ratios of ten to one, or a hundred to one, limited only by their self confidence and taste for risk. Private equity, which might be better named private debt, gets its astronomically high rate of return on equity capital, through the use of borrowed money. The equity is fairly small. As in the 1920s, the game continues only as long as asset prices continue to inflate; and all the leverage contributes to the asset inflation, conveniently creating higher priced collateral against which to borrow even more money.<br />The fourth parallel is the<strong> corruption of the gatekeepers</strong>. In the 1920s, the corrupted insiders were brokers running stock pools and bankers as purveyors of watered stock. 1990s, it was accountants, auditors and stock analysts, who were supposedly agents of investors, but who turned out to be confederates of corporate executives. You can give this an antiseptic academic term and call it a failure of agency, but a better phrase is conflicts of interest. In this decade, it remains to be seen whether the bond rating agencies were corrupted by conflicts of interest, or merely incompetent. The core structural conflict is that the rating agencies are paid by the firms that issue the bonds. Who gets the business &#8211; the rating agencies with tough standards or generous ones? Are ratings for sale? And what, really, is the technical basis for their ratings? All of this is opaque, and unregulated, and only now being investigated by Congress and the SEC.<br />Yet another parallel is the <strong>failure of regulation to keep up with financial innovation</strong> that is either far too risky to justify the benefit to the real economy, or just plain corrupt, or both. In the 1920s, many of these securities were utterly opaque. Ferdinand Pecora, in his 1939 memoirs describing the pyramid schemes of public utility holding companies, the most notorious of which was controlled by the Insull family, opined that the pyramid structure was not even fully understood by Mr. Insull. The same could be said of many of today&#8217;s derivatives on which technical traders make their fortunes.<br />By contrast, in the traditional banking system a bank examiner could look at a bank&#8217;s loan portfolio, see that loans were backed by collateral and verify that they were performing. If they were not, the bank was made to increase its reserves. Today&#8217;s examiner is not able to value a lot of the paper held by banks, and must rely on the banks&#8217; own models, which clearly failed to predict what happened in the case of sub-prime. The largest banking conglomerates are subjected to consolidated regulation, but the jurisdiction is fragmented, and at best the regulatory agencies can only make educated guesses about whether balance sheets are strong enough to withstand pressures when novel and exotic instruments create market conditions that cannot be anticipated by models.</p>
<p>A last parallel is ideological &#8211; the nearly universal conviction, 80 years ago and today, that <strong>markets are so perfectly self-regulating that government&#8217;s main job is to protect property rights, and otherwise just get out of the way.</strong></p>
<p>We all know the history. The regulatory reforms of the New Deal saved capitalism from its own self-cannibalizing instincts, and a <strong>reliable, transparent and regulated financial economy went on to anchor an unprecedented boom in the real economy</strong>. Financial markets were restored to their appropriate role as servants of the real economy, rather than masters. Financial regulation was pro-efficiency. I want to repeat that, because it is so utterly unfashionable, but it is well documented by economic history. Financial regulation was pro-efficiency. America&#8217;s squeaky clean, transparent, reliable financial markets were the envy of the world. They undergirded the entrepreneurship and dynamism in the rest of the economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What caught my eye is also what I have found in Adam Smith.<br />&#8220;Regulated, transparent, and reliable&#8221; markets.  Even if he met self-regulated, he was a moral philosopher as well.</p>

<p>In this Yahoo news article titled <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/mcclatchy/20071005/wl_mcclatchy/200/71005bcturkey_attn_national_foreign_editors_ytop">&#8220;Turkish envoy warns against U.S. genocide resolution&#8221;</a>, this stood out for me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Justice Department records show that Turkey signed a $100,000 -a-month contract in May with the lobbying firm DLA Piper, one of several hired to fight the resolution.</p>
<p>Separately, Turkey paid Bob Livingston , former House Appropriations Committee chairman, $625,000 for work from March 1 to Aug. 31, records show. Last month, Turkey added the public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard to its roster at $113,000 a month. </p></blockquote>
<p>Republicans selling out the US to a fanatical Muslims is no new thing, but how is it that we can let other countries buy American foreign policy while being so blatant about it?</p>

<p>There was a “successful” Star Wars missile intercept on Friday Sep 29, where a “vehicle” launched from Alaska was “tracked” and “intercepted” by a star wars “missile” fired from California.  The “intercept” took place over the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>James T. Hackett writes in the Oct 5 Washington Times that the success proves “critics” of star wars wrong.</p>
<p>He makes a few wild claims about star wars “working” then quotes Charles McQueary, DoD Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, that two flight test a year are just fine to justify continuing to spend billions to deploy unproven technology.</p>
<p>The tests are meaningless, extremely expensive, the vehicles are not reusable, they are all “successes” and they are not going to slow the flow of money, so two a year are just fine. </p>
<p>The system is not needed and will not work.</p>
<p>Hackett of Heritage Foundation, a group who has never seen a reason to stop spending money on unneeded and faulty weapons, claims the test to be useful and that the test was done using operational resources.  Here he presents a half hearted respect for the operating use of the weapons.  But his use is misleading.  There was nothing operational about the test.  It was highly scripted and would have been scrubbed had any issue arise during the “count downs”.</p>
<p>Star wars is going to have as much success getting an interceptor off on time as NASA has launching the shuttle.</p>
<p>The crews operating the weapons and surveillance were supposed to be operators, they were but they are the operators doing the laboratory tests and the implication that they are just like regular GI&#8217;s is misleading at best.</p>
<p>The workers setting the equipment up are highly skilled well paid contractor technicians, like those NASA uses to launch the shuttle.</p>
<p>Mc Queary, has a PhD in Engineering Mechanics and has been involved in the profit side of the military industrial complex for most of his working life.  He certainly understands the need to “accept risk” from too little testing to keep the checks flowing to the contractors.</p>
<p>The tests had nothing to do with proving the system is &#8216;worth the expenditure of the taxpayers&#8217; grandchildren&#8217;s scarce resources&#8217;.  OMB Circular A-109 requires test be continuously performed and results evaluated to assure the effective use of scarce resources. </p>
<p>This is what Mises recognizes; that the technology is driven by monopoly power and political influence.</p>
<p>Here is what is wrong with limiting tests:  In Apr 2000 the Osprey, MV-22 killed 22 marines, all GI marines, not scientists, because the test program did not do enough flight test to understand all the conditions the aircraft would confront.</p>
<p>Then in Dec 2000, another crash resulted from a flight issue where the software testing was too short to show fatal situations where the system “reacted” to the total loss of the airplane.</p>
<p>It is well and good for the insiders who make a lot of money and have no kids&#8217; lives depending on the system to say we can spend all that money and not worry about testing it properly.</p>
<p>I am beginning to like <a href="http://blog.mises.org/archives/007257.asp">Mises.org</a>.</p>
<p>This is titled “A World Without NASA&#8221;.</p>
<p>You could as easily put war machine, Homeland Insecurity, Dept of Energy or Transportation in there, as well possibly as HHS.</p>
<p>The linked article discusses opportunity costs from government control of science and technology similar to the arguments about opportunity losses due to the war machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible to predict the opportunity costs that were foregone with the redistribution of billions of dollars confiscated from taxpayers. Not only did individuals have less money to invest in alternative methods of space-based aviation and research, but entrepreneurs had to compete against a well-financed monopoly.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would highlight the idea of well financed monopoly.</p>
<p>The military industrial complex with all the vices of the monopoly is eating the trough of the nation.</p>

<blockquote><p>Every so often a quote comes out of the Bush administration that leaves you asking: Am I crazy or are they? I had one of those moments last week when Dana Perino, the White House press secretary, was asked about a proposal by some Congressional Democrats to levy a surtax to pay for the Iraq war, and she responded, “We’ve always known that Democrats seem to revert to type, and they are willing to raise taxes on just about anything.” Yes, those silly Democrats. They’ll raise taxes for anything, even — get this — to pay for a war! And if we did raise taxes to pay for our war to bring a measure of democracy to the Arab world, “does anyone seriously believe that the Democrats are going to end these new taxes that they’re asking the American people to pay at a time when it’s not necessary to pay them?” added Ms. Perino. “I just think it’s completely fiscally irresponsible.”Friends, we are through the looking glass. It is now “fiscally irresponsible” to want to pay for a war with a tax. These democrats just don’t understand: the tooth fairy pays for wars. Of course she does — the tooth fairy leaves the money at the end of every month under Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson’s pillow. And what a big pillow it is! My God, what will the Democrats come up with next? Taxes to rebuild bridges or schools or high-speed rail or our lagging broadband networks? No, no, the tooth fairy covers all that. She borrows the money from China and leaves it under Paulson’s pillow. Of course, we can pay for the Iraq war without a tax increase. The question is, can we pay for it and be making the investments in infrastructure, science and education needed to propel our country into the 21st century? Visit Singapore, Japan, Korea, China or parts of Europe today and you’ll discover that the infrastructure in our country is not keeping pace with our peers’. We can pay for anything today if we want to stop investing in tomorrow. The president has already slashed the National Institutes of Health research funding the past two years. His 2008 budget wants us to cut money for vocational training, infrastructure and many student aid programs. Does the Bush team really believe that if we had a $1-a-gallon gasoline tax — which could reduce our dependence on Middle East oil dictators, and reduce payroll taxes for low-income workers, pay down the deficit and fund the development of renewable energy — we would be worse off as a country? Excuse me, Ms. Perino, but I wish Republicans would revert to type. I thought they were, well, conservatives — the kind of people who saved for rainy days, who invested in tomorrow for their kids, folks who didn’t believe in free lunches or free wars.</p></blockquote>
<p>With Tony Blow as press secretary, we could count on a daily dosage of stupidity and mendacity.  But Tony was neither as dumb nor as dishonest as Dana Perino.  Is the White House taking great joy in the fact that every time she opens her mouth, I think “what nuttiness is going to from out of this blonde bimbo’s mouth now”? A tip of the hat to Thomas Friedman for at least knowing that this stupid war means higher taxes for someone at sometime. Another hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/10/who-should-pay-.html">Mark Thoma</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Being forced to pay for a war I don&#8217;t support would tick me off, but that&#8217;s the point &#8211; by making the public fully internalize the cost of the nation&#8217;s decision to go to war (including the human cost), it will motivate more pressure to bring this war to an end.</p></blockquote>
<p>I opposed this war too and likely voted for Bush-Cheney as many times as Mark did – zero.  But yes, we will have to pay for their incredibly stupid decision on March 19, 2003.  Could we at least be spared the free lunch idiocy of their minions like Dana Perino?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100500764.html">Cecilia Kang</a> plays Steno Sue with her <em>Strong Jobs Report Eases Fears Over Economy&#8217;s Health</em>.  Steno Cecilia listens to President Bush and just repeats his spin:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush said the jobs report pointed to a &#8220;vibrant and strong&#8221; economy, and he urged Congress to keep taxes low. In brief remarks from the Oval Office, he said he was mindful that some homeowners were worried about mortgage payments or the rising cost of college but added that with the revisions from August, &#8220;it means that we&#8217;ve had 49 consecutive months of job creation. And that&#8217;s the longest uninterrupted job growth on record for our country.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=10&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=does_the_washington_post_work">Dean Baker</a> puts all of this in context:</p>
<blockquote><p>The article also allowed the Bush administration to do some unanswered boasting. Quoting the White House that the upward revision to the August data (from a loss to a gain) coupled with September&#8217;s jobs numbers &#8220;means that we&#8217;ve had 49 consecutive months of job creation. And that&#8217;s the longest uninterrupted job growth on record for our country.&#8221; While the statement is true, it is not terribly meaningful. Prior stretches of job creation were interrupted by short strikes. Since the White House is interested in records, the Post could have pointed out that the 0.64 percent annual rate of job growth since President Bush took office is also the slowest rate of job growth on record for any comparable period of time. </p></blockquote>
<p>Dean must be referring to the payroll survey which shows a cumulative increase of only 4.36% over the past 6.75 years.  The average growth rate has been anemic indeed.  OK, Lawrence Kudlow and his crew will likely scream household survey forgetting about this footnote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Data affected by changes in population controls in January 2000, January 2003, January 2004, January 2005, January 2006, and January 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>If one ignores this footnote, employment growth would appear to be 6.28% over this period.  We might also notice that population has grown by 7.13%.  You see – the employment to population ratio fell from 64.4% as of December 2000 to 62.9% as of September 2007.  Simply put – employment has not grown as fast as the population regardless of how one measures it.  One would think a reporter working for the Washington Post to at least get the data right.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=10&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=does_the_washington_post_work#comment-4483872">Tim Worstall</a> offers this lame protest to what Dean said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think you may protest too much on this (no evidence, it&#8217;s just a feeling). From what I remember the unemployment rate at the start of the Clinton years was rather higher than it is now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Crackers!  That old chestnut?  Yes Tim.  Clinton did inherit a 7.4% unemployment rate but he left a 3.9% unemployment rate.  Employment growth was strong enough during his eight years in office to dramatically lower the unemployment rate even as the labor force participation rate rose from 66.3% as of December 1992 to 67% as of December 2000.  In other words, the employment to population rate rose from 61.4% to 64.4%.  That’s some impressive job growth.  Now if you wish to see what happened to the labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio since December, check our <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/september-employment-report.html">my graph</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/05/pathetic">Paul Krugman</a> weighs in:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the whole of the Clinton administration, the economy added 22.7 million jobs – 237,000 per month. Over the whole of the Bush administration to date, the economy added only 5.8 million jobs – 72,000 per month. The Bushies like to pretend that history began in August 2003, so that they can ignore the job losses early in the administration. But even that doesn’t do the trick. Since August 2003, the economy has added 8.5 million jobs – 172,000 per month. So even by cherry-picking the good Bush years and pretending the bad years never happened, they still can’t match the average rate of job creation under Clinton. Now, you might say that Clinton doesn’t deserve all the credit for good things that happened on his watch – and I agree. But it’s the Bushies who are trying to spin a mediocre job record into proof that their policies are wonderful. Did I mention that the Clinton job boom followed an, um, increase in taxes?</p></blockquote>

He also notes that the unemployment rate rose a bit, which is interesting because the employment to population ratio (E/P) rose.  Then again, the labor force participation rate (LFPR) rose even more.  Speaking of which, Bill has some wise – if not kind – remarks:</p>
<blockquote><p>The long run trends are for lower LFPR and E/P as the baby boomers retire. But that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re seeing here. I raised the point then and repeat it now as a caution to not necessarily expect the &#8220;optimal&#8221; ratios today (and in years to come) to equal those of the late &#8217;90s. However, the declines over the last year (like the increases in the previous year) are of a more high frequency nature. PGL is correct to raise the issue. The decline in these numbers since December is indicative of some potential problems below the surface that deserve more investigation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bill promises more thoughts on this later.  Thanks Bill!  We look forward to seeing your next post on this.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>On September 28th Bill Moyers&#8217; guest was John Bogle. You can see the interview or read the transcript from <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/archives/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The setup for the interview is about private equity firms and he mentions the Sunday NY Times front page article: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/business/23nursing.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">At Many Homes, More Profit and Less Nursing</a>.</p>
<p>His introduction of Mr. Bogle is:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>It&#8217;s this kind of capitalism that drives John Bogle up the wall, as you&#8217;re about to learn. John Bogle believes owners should be in charge — and accountable. He&#8217;s known and respected world-wide as the father of index funds and the founder of The Vanguard Group, one of the largest mutual funds anywhere, with over a trillion dollars in assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>I make no bones about it. My opinion is that the focus is currently wrong 1. as it relates to purpose of an economy and 2. by the philosophy that studies it: economics. The focus of understanding resulting in the judgment of an economy, should be in how successful it is in fulfilling these two aspects of the constitution: insure domestic tranquility, promote the general welfare.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll put it this way: to what purpose is there to knowing how to make horse power, greater efficiency, greater durability, the relationship of the parts in motion, the chemistry of fuels, the metallurgy, flow dynamics, etc., etc., etc. if not to serve people? Just because? Just to make more?</p>
<p>So picture me in my recliner (be kind), suspicious of what I will hear when Mr. Moyers asked:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>BILL MOYERS: What should be the dominant? What is the job of capitalism?</p>
<p>JOHN BOGLE: Well, ultimately, the job of capitalism is to serve the consumer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WHAT?!!!!!!!! There is someone with more money than God that thinks like me? But&#8230;is there a but? Don&#8217;t tease me like this. I&#8217;m the one saying we are making money from money and that such is of no substance especially as it relates to our purpose (see US Constitution).</p>
<p>Within his answer is:</p>
<blockquote><p>But, we&#8217;ve moved from that to a big capital accumulation — self interest — creating wealth for the providers of these services when the providers of these services are in fact subtracting value from society. So, it doesn&#8217;t work.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can mail my PhD diploma &#8212; thank you very much, to: &#8230; : )</p>
<p>He notes that Lord Keynes has gotten “misshapen”. How?</p>
<blockquote><p>JOHN BOGLE: Well, it&#8217;s gotten misshapen because the financial side of the economy is dominating the productive side of the economy&#8230;We&#8217;ve become a financial economy which has overwhelmed the productive economy to the detriment of investors and the detriment ultimately of our society. </p></blockquote>
<p>How bad is it?</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s just gotten totally out of hand. My estimate is that the financial sector takes $560 billion a year out of society. Five hundred and sixty billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did I hear this right, focusing on making money from money is not where it&#8217;s at? It&#8217;s hurting us?</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to come back to the difference between the financial system and the productive system. The productive system adds to the value of our economy. And, by and large, the financial system subtracts. And, yet, it&#8217;s growing and growing and growing. And this short term thing where short term orientation in which trading pieces of paper is regarded as a social value. It is not a social value.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what about labor? Do those at the top really get what they deserve?<br />
<blockquote>And they get enormous amounts of pay for actually doing very little. I&#8217;m a<br />businessman. Listen, we all&#8211; we chief executives get an awful lot of credit<br />that we don&#8217;t deserve. Real work in companies is done by the people who are<br />getting themselves together and doing the hard work of making companies grow&#8211;</p></blockquote>
<p>So, Milton knew of externalities, and a need for governance. Although it&#8217;s already in the constitution and should not be debatable. Cactus&#8217; is showing us ideology matters. And now a person who makes money from money is telling us the current ideology has gone to far. What&#8217;s next? The World Bank seeing the light? Glad you asked. That is exactly what is next.</p>

                                <p>So says our <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/10/20071005-2.html">Liar-in-Chief</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>I want to thank members of my economic team for coming in the Oval Office this morning to bring some good news here for America&#8217;s families and America&#8217;s working people. The &#8211; last month our economy added 110,000 new jobs. And that&#8217;s good news for people here in our country. It&#8217;s an indicator that this economy is a vibrant and strong economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Real GDP growth from 2006QII to 2007QII was less than 1.9 percent. While it is true that we’ve added over one million new jobs over the past nine months per the payroll survey, the growth in employment has not been sufficient to keep the employment to population ratio from declining.  As of December 2006, this ratio stood at 63.4 percent.  As of last month, it stood at 62.9 percent (*).  To claim we have a vibrant and strong economy ignores the economic data that we’ve witnessed this year. </p>
<p>Of course, the claim that the economy is vibrant wasn’t the worst of what President Bush said this morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want this economy continue to grow, and if you want to reinforce the fact that we&#8217;ve got &#8211; entrepreneurship is strong and people are working, don&#8217;t raise taxes. And I&#8217;m looking forward to working with the Congress to set priorities on how we spend the people&#8217;s money</p></blockquote>
<p>Setting priorities as in all that spending making a mess out of Iraq.  Of course, we’ll never have to pay more in taxes because of this fiasco as money grows on trees – at least in the mind of the leaders of today’s Republican Party.</p>
<blockquote><p>* original misplacement of decimal point fixed &#8211; thanks to one alert reader.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I see that Karl Rove has his minions spamming our comment box with “blame the elders” and “blame the women” excuses for the fact that the employment to population ratio is currently well below what it was say in December 2000.  Karl Rove’s minions must be too lazy, dumb, or dishonest to check over at the BLS website for the details so I just did.  The employment to population ratio for the 55 plus crowd was 31.8 percent as of December 2000 and now is 37.6 percent.  Maybe there are more elders but these guys aren’t exactly retiring early.</p>
<p>Now as far as the ladies, their employment to population ratio did decline from 57.6 percent as of December 2000 to 56.7 percent last month.  The ratio for the fellows declined from 71.7 percent to 69.5 percent.  Oh well, Karl really does need to get a smarter class of minions.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Based on a conversation I had with reader Debbie, I was thinking about identity theft for the last day or so.  I also had a discussion with the Ex-GF (for new readers, that&#8217;s my wife) about this; she was the victim of identity theft at one point.  Its a big deal in this society, and I think I have a potential solution&#8230;</p>
<p>If someone steals someone else&#8217;s identity, their intention is to benefit from the reputation and credit rating and so forth that derive from the way their victim has conducted him/herself.  Perhaps then they should also be required to, well, suffer the consequences for the way their victim conducted him/herself.</p>
<p>For example&#8230;  the Ex-GF had a big pile of student loans at the time her identity was stolen.  Why not make the thief responsible for paying those loans &#8211; not directly, of course&#8230;  perhaps the thief would have to send the Ex-GF in the amount of the payment due every month.  Alternatively, the thief would have to send the government an amount equal to that payment every month to compensate society for the losses of that identity theft; the government could then reduce the tax burden on everyone else by the same amount.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the victim of identity theft was proven to be the perpetrator of some crime, such as homicide, the person committing the identity theft could be required to serve part of the time, or perhaps a concurrent sentence.  </p>
<p>Such a structure would would add some serious disincentive to those considering committing identity theft.  Such a disincentive is really needed&#8230;  the Ex-GF was able to quickly determine who had stolen her identity, and provided all the necessary evidence to the police.  However, because the amount stolen was small, the police declined to do anything.  But the time and effort she went through to fix the problem was pretty substantial.</p>
