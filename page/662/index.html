<p>Pulled from the front page of the <a href="http://www.georgewbushstore.com/home.htm">George W. Bush store</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As licensee for the last eight years to the George W. Bush Presidential Campaigns, and as the creator of the George W. Bush Store, Spalding Group has been fortunate to experience the tremendous popularity and respect that President Bush has attained. As President Bush enters his last year in office, we are receiving countless requests for new items that allow supporters to demonstrate their appreciation and admiration for our President.</p>
<p>As a result, Spalding Group is proud to present the first in a series of products that reflect our way of saying &#8220;Thank You&#8221; to President Bush. Check back often as we add new items throughout the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think its a partisan to say that GW hasn&#8217;t exactly experienced &#8220;tremendous popularity and respect&#8221; and that most Americans (and foreigners for that matter) don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s in the same league recent predecessors like Clinton, GHW Bush, and Reagan.  I realize this company is targeting a very specific market: the dwindling percentage of Americans who feel any need to &#8220;to demonstrate their appreciation and admiration for our President.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Which leads to a question&#8230; why do people feel the need to believe that huge numbers of other people feel as they do?  Its one thing to believe you&#8217;re right, its a whole another thing to convince yourself, despite all sorts of evidence to the contrary, that all but a small fringe of terrorist-loving moonbats (it is necessary to have someone on the other side, after all) agrees with you.  In this case, for the dwindling 28% or so to believe that GW should be very popular requires ignoring a lot more evidence than believing he is popular.  (As Coberly mentioned in comments to another post, I hasten to add:  a Democrat President who had spent the last seven years getting us from the year 2000 to here would probably also have a core group of die-hards, so this is not a Republican v. Democrat issue.)  </p>
<p>But&#8230;  did those who supported Reagan or Clinton, to name two Presidents who actually were popular, and both of whom were respected by at least half the population, also feel the need to make themselves believe that President was more popular and respected than he actually was?  Does the desire to convince oneself and others that one is part of a large herd increase when the herd is really very, very small?  And is there a point where evidence overwhelms one&#8217;s wish or ability to believe things contrary to that evidence for everyone?</p>

<blockquote><p>A recent survey that found some Florida teens believe drinking a cap of bleach will prevent HIV and a shot of Mountain Dew will stop pregnancy has prompted lawmakers to push for an overhaul of sex education in the state.</p>
<p>The survey showed that Florida teens also believe that smoking marijuana will prevent a person from getting pregnant.State lawmakers said the myths are spreading because of Florida&#8217;s abstinence-only sex education, Local 6 reported.</p>
<p>They are proposing a bill that would require a more comprehensive approach, the report said.It would still require teaching abstinence but students would also learn about condoms and other methods of birth control and disease prevention.</p></blockquote>
<p>Normally, here at Angry Bear we&#8217;re big on testing things, but here&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t have data for, so please indulge me if I try going the conjecture route this time.  My guess is that in the subset of teens that did not have what most of us think of as sex-ed, those that had abstinence only education are probably more likely to believe stuff like this.  My guess is that those who are told nothing will spend some time on the internet trying to learn about the birds and the bees, and at least some of them will stumble on some useful information.  Why do I think this?  Well, my guess is that teenagers don&#8217;t spend all that much time searching online for more on what they just took in trig class.  Those who look for information are the ones who don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re getting it, and teens taking an abstinence only class or a class that says having-sex-means-you&#8217;re-evil presumably are more likely to think they&#8217;re learning something about sex than those who don&#8217;t have a sex-ed class at all.</p>

                                <p>Even with the drop in employment the new data really does not add much new information to what we knew a month ago.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R_YnVSmoYhI/AAAAAAAAALk/Edu_XoUMah4/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R_YnVSmoYhI/AAAAAAAAALk/Edu_XoUMah4/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Interestingly hours worked rose this month.  But the first quarter average is 107.4 as compared to 107.7 last quarter.  This gives you about a 1.1% quarterly drop&#8211;seasonally adjusted annual rate &#8212; for the first quarter, or what I said it should be last month.  Depending on productivity this implies that first quarter real GDP growth will between -1.0% and 0.0%.</p>

<p>One of the little noticed developments is that nominal income growth is slowing sharply &#8212; from<br />both the drop in hours worked and the slowing of wage growth. Nominal income growth is a very good good leading indicator of inflation and implies that the worries about inflation are overblown. However, the slowing of inflation will trail the  slowing of real growth and employment.</p>

                                <p>Reader Ken Melvin sends along some thoughts on housing prices:</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Speculation in housing:</p>
<p>Much of the speculation in houses is due leveraging.   The buyer puts down 10% on a $500,000 home, first year; price of the home goes up 10% to $550,000.  The buyer sells and voila, makes 100% on his 10% down.  Hell of a deal.  Next buyer puts down $55,000, price goes to $605,000.  Next buyer puts down $60,500, house goes to $665,500, …  Another year later; $732,050.  Getting ridiculous, so it begins to slow a bit.  Say increases drop to 5%.  Buyers say, still not too shabby, in fact, we’ll gladly settle for a mere 50% return.  So, they plunk down $73,205, prices goes to $768,600, houses sell, and the buyers makes 50% return on their investment.</p>
<p>How best offset the speculative force of leveraging? No help from the world of finance here.  They’re getting a cut.  Given that I think that speculation in housing is bad and think that this can easily be proven; we can; put a high tax on residential real estate gains, fifty per cent or better &#8211; make it high – make it mean something, and, keep assessments current.</p>
<p>Why the lender should be partner:</p>
<p>Guy builds a bunch of condos in Bayland planning to sell them for $550,000.  Oops, sub-prime crisis – has to sell these condos for $350,000; a price that still affords the developer a decent return.  So, the price is whatever the market will bear.  If the condos in Bayland ha been completed and were sold a couple years ago, when the market price for such was $550,000, the developers would have stuck an additional $200,000 per in their pocket, a small ton of money, and, by now, all them would be running for US Senator.  The lender would have packaged the $550,000 loans as ‘financial instruments’, sold them, then, with new and better reserves, loaned more money to buy more overpriced condos.   So:  The developer will sell their product for anything between a reasonable mark up and whatever the market will bear.  The buyer doesn’t have anyway of knowing what the units are really worth.  But, the lenders and the builders do.  If the lenders were partner to the purchase, they wouldn’t give anymore than they had to give.  If the lenders were partners to the purchase, they would have said we’ll lend no more than 90% of $350,000.  This way, the buyers don’t get stuck owing $495,000 (assuming they paid 10% down) on a condo worth $350,000, aren’t bankrupting themselves making payments on overpriced condos, and, more people will be able to afford housing. </p>
<p>At a selling price of $350,000, the buyer puts down $35,000 and owns 10% of the condo, while the lender owns the remaining 90%.  Price goes to $400,000 in two years, condo sells, lender nets $45,000, buyer $5,000.  Little speculative force due leverage here. </p>
<p>Conversely, say price goes down to $300,000 over two years, condo sells, lender loses $45,000, buyer $5,000.  If the price goes down to $300,000 and there’s no sale of the condo of the example, the condo’s worth about what the buyer owes (~$300,000), so chances are the buyer would hang in there and continue making payments.  Compare this way of financing housing to what we have now.</p>
<p>A footnote on an associated aspect of housing prices &#8211; interest rates and housing prices: In short, housing prices are a function of the payments a typical homebuyer can afford and thus are a function of interest rates.  If a buyer can afford payments of $3,000/mo and interest rates are 6%; the buyer can afford to pay $500,000 for a house.  If interest rates go to 8%; the same buyer can only afford a $370,000 house.  Whether houses are built is determined by the difference (margin) between what potential buyers can afford and their building costs.  The sub-prime loans skewed the (initial) payments the buyer could afford.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Here&#8217;s some information provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of NY about the <a rhef="http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2008/AnnexII.html">Bear Stearns bailout</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The $29 billion credit extension is supported by assets that were valued at $30 billion by Bear Stearns, which valued the assets at market value on March 14.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, come on.  If someone other than Bear Stearns was willing to value those assets at $30 billion, would the Fed have had to step in? FWIW, the Fed should be aware I&#8217;ve got all sorts of assets lying around the house that I&#8217;d be happy to let the Fed take off my hands for what I valued them on March 14.  Heck, I&#8217;d be willing to let the Fed have them at a 10% discount off the value I claim to place on them.  In fact, in the cactus abode, we&#8217;re all in it together &#8211; the cat is depositing something in the litter box as I type that I&#8217;ll throw in for free.</p>
<blockquote><p>JPMorgan Chase will extend a subordinated loan for $1 billion that will absorb losses, if any, on the sale of these assets before the Federal Reserve.</p></blockquote>
<p>In theory, this means that at least right now, JPM has some skin in the game.  In practice&#8230;  well, if it happens that JPM does lose money on this, what&#8217;s to prevent another announcement by the Fed just like this one, but with the funds going to bail out JPM, or whatever entity gets created to hold JPM&#8217;s toxic waste?  (Paulson&#8217;s guarantee that the Treasury would make up the Fed&#8217;s losses just add to that likelihood.)</p>
<p>The reason to give us at least the illusion that JPM might actually lose money on this is to ensure that if things go well, JPM will be the one to make the money, not the Fed which even on paper is taking up the bulk (29/30ths) of the risk.   Which raises the question I (and others) have asked over and over&#8230; if the bailout of Bear Stearns really was necessary and worth breaking all sorts of precedents to achieve, then why didn&#8217;t the Fed just take over Bear Stearns directly, sit on it until things got better, and then sold it off piece by piece?  Its hard to see how the Fed&#8217;s risk would be all that much greater, but its easy to see how the potential benefit to the taxpayer would be.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update&#8230;  In comments, some readers object to the idea of the Fed owning Bear Stearns.  Well, here&#8217;s another option&#8230;  given that the Fed has assumed most of the risk but little of the potential upside of BS&#8217; most toxic securities, why didn&#8217;t it simply buy those outright?   The risk would have been essentially the same, but the profits, should there be any, would then accrue to the Fed, not JPM.  Even assuming the goal was to ensure that those bonds in particular didn&#8217;t go belly-up, there were ways of doing it that were a lot a less of a giveaway to JPM.</p>

<p>Update 2&#8230;  Yves Smith at <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/04/bear-hearings-charade.html">Naked Capitalism</a> has a post on the Bear Stearns hearings before Congress yesterday.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a line from <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/">Ken Houghton</a> which sums it all up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Congress has ready access to Wall Street bailout advocates. It&#8217;s only on vacation that they speak with the people who elect them.</p></blockquote>

Can it be said better &#8211; less convoluted and more prosy?   I really don&#8217;t like this sentence at all&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>So that GDP per capita is more or less what we, the people and government of the US, earned, on average, after you subtract off unsold goods, stuff sold on the black market and criminal enterprises, money that got sent abroad, waste, corporate profits that aren&#8217;t distributed, creative accounting and rounding errors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Updated the sentence marginally &#8211; added the words &#8220;corporate profits that aren&#8217;t distributed, creative accounting.&#8221;  The sentence is more precise, but more unwieldy too&#8230;  Help!</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>One more try, this time breaking it up:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>So GDP per capita is more or less what we, the people and government of the US, earned, on average, after you subtract off a few other things.  A big part of those “few other things” involve corporations.  For instance, corporations often don’t distribute their profits to their owners in any given year, which means that those profits are part of GDP, but don’t quite trace back to any person’s income that year.  Then there’s waste, unsold inventory, creative accounting, rounding errors, and money that gets sent abroad.</p></blockquote>
<p>Better, but still not the 12th grade level I&#8217;m looking for.  Anyone want to play editor?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Updated again, slightly.  Money gets sent abroad, not sold abroad.</p>

<blockquote><p>New Orleans &#8211; If you think the prescription drug you took for headaches caused your heart attack, the Food and Drug Administration says you can&#8217;t sue the maker for injury if it met agency standards.<br />The Consumer Product Safety Commission says you can&#8217;t sue a mattress maker if your mattress bursts into flame despite meeting CPSC standards. Companies making sport utility vehicles would get similar protection from suits brought by people injured or the families of those killed in rollovers under National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposals for stronger roofs.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys call it &#8220;silent tort reform.&#8221; But it&#8217;s part of tension existing since the nation&#8217;s founding: conflict between state and federal law.</p>
<p>If they clash, state laws give way. That&#8217;s in Article Six of the Constitution. But in areas where there is no federal law, federal courts must defer to laws of the state where a lawsuit is heard. That includes product liability.</p>
<p>A developing body of judicial opinion could place new limits on the rights of those who buy or use products, consumer advocates say. It also could mean the savings of billions of dollars by companies insulated from lawsuits.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s riling plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers, consumer groups and some regulators is agencies&#8217; assertions their rules override state product liability laws. Most such claims are rooted in statements in the introductions to their rules, not the rules themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;These pre-emption preambles may be only the beginning,&#8221; New York University law professor Catherine Sharkey wrote in the DePaul Law Review. She projected preambles may &#8220;displace competing or conflicting state regulations or common law as a matter of course.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We have seen how the <a href="http://aolsearcht3.search.aol.com/aol/search?encquery=49d34940c263711b&#038;invocationType=keyword_rollover&#038;ie=UTF-8">OCC has pre-empted</a> financial regulation from states through administrative action without much discussion. Devices have been pre-empted from the injury lawsuit as well.</p>
<p>Now, is this giving new meaning to the word captured, and what is being captured? And what words describe the process? And are other areas of life be captured in similar fashion?</p>
<p>And we are shrinking their resources?</p>
<p>Update:  The real issue here is the stealth issue, massive changes without public discussion. I would have as much concern if federal law was torn to shreds by &#8220;states rights&#8221; advocates. My assumption is the issue is used to screen and confuse the real interests behind the push, which usually is public policy and needs lights and transparency before the impact is felt that the changes cause, and then forced into the open, for &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221;.  The second issue is what the changes are about, which at least is debated in the examples in comments.    The rather glib &#8220;sue the FDA&#8221; answer turns our current system on its head.</p>
<p>The shutting down of court redress for product liability is huge whether you think it should be changed or not.  The strangling of a regulatory agencies resources to provide reasonable assurances of safety and that provides a shield for product liabilities, intended or not, creates far reaching impacts on our legal system.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>At the risk of violating Godwin&#8217;s Law, I note, as many have before, that Hitler, Himmler, and pretty much the entire top tier of leadership of Nazi Germany bore little resemblance to the Aryan ideals they espoused.  Not a blond haired, blue eyed superman in the bunch until you get down to third stringers like Heydrich.  And yet, they convinced one of the most highly educated nations on earth, plus a whole host of useful idiots in other countries, of the, shall we say, rightness, of the Nazi ideology.  Millions fought and died in the name of that ideology, and there are still millions around today who would kill for it.</p>
<p>I was thinking of that, and of what we here at Angry Bear do regularly, and what folks at a lot of other blogs and other walks of life do &#8211; try to set the record the straight.  And I was thinking of how difficult, and how frustrating, that can be.  The byline of <a href="http://straightdope.com/">The Straight Dope</a>, which was a blog long before anyone imagined the internet, is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fighting Ignorance Since 1973 (It&#8217;s Taking Longer Than We Thought)</p></blockquote>
<p>And it occurs to me&#8230; it should be easy to get across to people that Hitler and Himmler and Goebbels and Bormann and Goering and the rest of that group are at best  average specimens of humanity &#8211; heck, one visual sighting oughta do it.  But it didn&#8217;t.  Which raises the question &#8211; is it even possible to get across less obvious ideas that require some thought or at least looking at data?  Obvious examples include the notion that cutting tax rates has a very effect when tax rates are high than when they are low, or that the Presidents who most expanded government services were also the ones that produced the fastest real economic growth rates in the last hundred years or so (think FDR and LBJ, both of whom far outpaced, say, Ronald Reagan).  </p>
<p>Are there always going to be some people who cannot accept basic, obvious, self-evident facts?  Are there ways to get such facts across?  And if there are people who cannot accept information in black and white, is discourse with them possible, and if so, how should it take place, and what percentage of the public can be described that way?</p>
