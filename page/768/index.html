                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/27/AR2007102701241.html">Chris Cillizza and Shailagh Murray</a> write without further comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the radio spot, Giuliani mentions his battle with prostate cancer and notes that his chances of surviving the disease in America were 82 percent, while in England his chances would have been 44 percent.  &#8220;You and I should be making the decisions about what kind of health care we get with our doctors, not with a government bureaucrat,&#8221; Giuliani says in the ad. </p></blockquote>
<p>By the same token – a French man has a 100% chance of surviving breast cancer.  Kevin Drum notes that Rudy is <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_10/012380.php">full of shit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you can see from the chart on the right, Britain and the United States have virtually identical mortality rates from prostate cancer. The only reason the U.S. has a higher survival rate is because we diagnose way more prostate cancer than Britain in the first place. In other words, the difference probably isn&#8217;t that we&#8217;re any better at prostate cancer surgery than the Brits, but that we aggressively screen for even mild cases of prostate cancer that probably aren&#8217;t life-threatening in the first place &#8211; and then, unsurprisingly, we go on to survive all these non-threatening cancers regardless of treatment. So not only is Giuliani&#8217;s statistic bogus, but it might actually reflect poorly on U.S. practices. British mortality rates from prostate cancer are just as good as ours, and they manage this without wasting time, money, and emotional distress on overdiagnosis or overtreatment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Click on Kevin’s chart and you are directed to an <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2006/05/i_wonk_because_.html">Ezra Klein</a> takedown of Cato’s <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/05/02/depends-on-what-the-meaning-of-universal-is/">Michael Cannon</a> &#8211; the latter claiming:</p>
<blockquote><p>For prostate cancer, you are twice as likely to die of it in Germany as in the U.S. (44 percent vs. 19 percent).</p></blockquote>
<p>Ezra consults with Cannon’s source and summarizes thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why does Germany have less than half our prostate cancer incidence?  And does it mean that their cancers are more serious, less curable cases?  It&#8217;s unclear.  But the bottom line is that you&#8217;re no more likely to die of prostate cancer in Germany than the US, and you&#8217;re also less likely to die of other things.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that Ezra posted his comments back on <strong>May 2, 2006</strong>.  One would think Chris Cillizza And Shailagh Murray could do a little fact checking before repeating Rudy’s BS as if it were gospel.  Look – Rudy has lied about a lot of things during his campaign.  And he keeps doing this because he knows he can.  Sort of like the reason Dick Cheney lies on Meet the Press.  Dick knows Tim Russert is not going to call him on his serial dishonesty.  Rudy figures that since this garbage worked for Bush-Cheney twice, it will work for him.  And as long as our press is as lazy and stupid as Chris Cillizza and Shailagh Murray, Rudy just might be right.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-0e-ettlinger29may29,0,3636830.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail">LA Times</a> carries an article about the beloved Twinkie. The Twinkie plant that used to smell wonderful as traffic passed, but has been replaced by Nordstrom and Nieman Marcus and condos on top floors, forced to move to Maine, and now only assembled in the US. Ouch!</p>
<blockquote><p>Although eight of the ingredients in the beloved little snack cake come from domestic corn and three from soybeans, there are others — including thiamine mononitrate — that come from petroleum. Chinese petroleum. Chinese refineries and Chinese factories. And there are other unexpected ingredients that are much harder to trace. So much for the great &#8220;All-American&#8221; snack food.</p>
<p>When you bite into a Twinkie, you are chewing on an international nexus of suppliers. Most of our processed foods — salad dressing, ice cream, meal-replacement drinks — are processed with foreign additives: essential ones, like B vitamins for fortifying flour and the preservative sorbic acid, as well as Malaysian or Indonesian palm oil products, European wheat gluten, Peruvian colorants, Chadian gums and Swiss niacin, made from Swiss water, Swiss air (nitrogen) and North Atlantic or Middle Eastern oil. It&#8217;s a nice contrast to recall that Champagne comes only from Champagne, France.</p>
<p>Like many other industries, food additives have been off-shored. No major domestic vitamin or sorbic acid manufacturers remain in the U.S. Our last vitamin C plant closed in 2005 — in fact, it closed as I was speaking to an employee about a tour — and most of our artificial colors and flavors come from abroad as well. Our chemical industry is rapidly dismantling its expensive domestic plants and either forming joint ventures with Chinese companies or simply buying chemicals from them. This leads to lower food and pharmaceutical prices, but perhaps at the cost of quality control.</p>
<p>How can you have quality control when you don&#8217;t even know where the ingredient is coming from? During my Twinkie research, I was particularly surprised that many American food additive &#8220;manufacturers&#8221; buy chemicals, especially vitamins, from distributors and do not know, or don&#8217;t ask, where they come from. The distributors usually sing the same song, as they often buy from importers, and the importers buy from exporters who — no surprise — are often not able or willing to identify all of their sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even purses run $500 &#8211; 1500 at the new mall.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The above post is a real story. The transfigured mall was just recently opened, although the condos on top are not finished yet. They are sold out, however. The twinkie factory moved to a newer plant in Maine, where less rent is required.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>We ever hear that we must keep on growing the economy.  Given the operative economic model, growth implies more consumption, more production.  Impossible!  Simply impossible! This model only extends as long as there are unlimited resources, which of course there never were.  [Much of the ‘growth’ to date has been at the expense of irreplaceable resources (there was no accounting for replacement)].  Yet, with resources stretched nearly to the limit and global warming breathing down our necks, we still hear the growth will lead us out mantra.   Best, with China and India joining this grow (read consume) your way to prosperity parade and the rest of Asia, Latin America and Africa forming up to join at the rear, we figure out another way.  Needed, new economics, economics that <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/25/europe/environ.php">best provide for the most while using minimal resources.</a></p>
<p>Whither the economic model that requires just enough production, just enough resources to provide most those things essential a comfortable life?  Time and time to start this search, and somewhere is good a place to begin. </p>
<p>First, a quick glance at where we are.  Then, a few thoughts on what’s possible. </p>
<p>How much slack in the system?  How much less usage of resources with more efficient utilization, reuse and recycling?  Why make the buy today throw away tomorrow?   Why make anything that won’t last?  Why make anything other the reusable/recyclable of anything other the recycled/reusable?  </p>
<p>Today:  Millions upon millions of resource intensive automobiles are produced, most of which sit unused the greater portion of the time.   Americans buy houses at least two times too large fifty miles from anywhere that sit unoccupied the greater portion of the time.  People buy so much they don’t need they have to rent storage for the unneeded before they have room for the new unneeded they want to buy (‘Go shopping”, the President said.)  How much is being wasted on the under-utilized and unnecessary?</p>
<p>How efficient is the automobile as a means of transportation?  Not very, is it? What are the real transportation needs?  What would be the cost in terms of resources of a system that provided the requisite transportation?  How much CO2 producing fossil fuel energy goes into the production of underutilized automobiles? Now, … the same questions of the McMansion houses.</p>
<p>How efficient is exporting America’s manufacturing to China and then importing the manufactured goods?  Let’s add the replacement cost to the price of fossil fuel used in this transport of goods then recalculate the cost of the imports from China.   Shouldn’t energy costs now and henceforth also include the cost of cleaning up the atmosphere?</p>
<p>We are running, have run out of options on global warming; much of the pending damage is probably irreversible; yet, continuing on as we are will make it much worse.  Thus it is that any cuts in energy consumption pay double dividends.  (Note: Running out of oil may prove to be a blessing.)</p>
<p>It’s safe enough to assume that we could provide a very comfortable living for the first world using far fewer resources.   With how much room to spare?  Is it possible to do so, and vastly improve the lots of the billions of Chinese, Indians, Latin Americans, Africans, …?  With less in toto resource consumption than now?  Yes, that’s right, less!  Big step, no? </p>
<p>That we can and must ever keep on growing the economy is one of two great fallacies abounding.  The other is that conservation is the answer to the population problem.  Conservation to allow for population growth facilitates population growth.  Simply providing the earth’s current level of population a decent standard of living requires severe reduction of resource use and may not even be possible.   Further population increase demands more of the earth’s resources, ensures more widespread poverty.</p>
<p>Mechanism for distribution:</p>
<p>Today, producing manufactured goods requires an ever diminishing, one-fourth that of forty years ago and decreasing, workforce per unit of production.   Moreover, the current economic model’s wealth distribution is premised on the rewarding of the same said no longer needed productive labor.  So imbedded this premise that today it is a moral issue. So we not only need develop a new economic model, we’ll be requiring a change in morals.  But how moral the model that requires man labor in service another the forty-hour week?  Less moral than the sixty or eighty hour week?  Than child labor?  Ah, morals, they serve us well.  So, how immoral the ten-hour week?</p>
<p>How distribute wealth in this new economic system?  We’ll need redefine work to include things other production.  Perhaps, contribution is a better, more descriptive term?  Maybe expand the concept of service to include such as the arts and mentoring?  Arts are the measure of a great society, no?  We can always use cleaner safer streets and more, more beautiful parks.  Again, there is no reason people need ‘work’ a given number of hours per day, per week&#8230;</p>
<p>Distribution was a problem with the old model; oh, there were a few good years in the middle of the twentieth century when it worked pretty well, but of late and prior that time, it didn’t really work for most.  In any new model, workers/contributors should be paid for their contribution and management for theirs; and, if investors are required, they’re entitled a return.  For sure, the flow aspect of the old model will be greatly lessened due the reduced consumption; so, too, its role in distribution.  Rather someone getting to hold onto their paycheck a few hours, maybe they get to hold on to a lesser amount for a longer time.</p>
<p>Am I being shrill?  Hopefully.  Too shrill?  Impossible.  Economics and global warming are inextricably linked.  Humankind may try to muddle through this, allowing economics to evolve as before, but this time there isn’t time.  Some risk you don’t take no matter the odds.  Even if we could limp along a while longer with today’s economics to do so would only accelerate global warming. </p>
<p>If we don’t act quickly (and perhaps even if we do everything possible) many, many are going to be displaced; many are going to die. As food becomes more and more scarce and habitable areas few and far between, the rich will use armed militias to kill others so as to get their food and resources &#8211; a return to Barbarianism &#8211; in an effort to survive.  But this is not that much different from what we are now doing under Bush and Cheney, is it?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>This one was by Ken Melvin.</p>
<p>I note&#8230;  I wouldn&#8217;t predict a return to Barbarism here in the US or in the &#8220;civilized world.&#8221;  But we&#8217;ve certainly all collectively stood aside while a return to barbarism occurred in some parts of the world&#8230;  the Sudan, for instance.  So while the post above may seem pretty shrill, I&#8217;m not sure how shrill it is.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>A comment was made the other day in Angry Bear that the real “cost” of the military in 1968 is understated because the military used conscription to mobilize the manpower to meets its goals in Vietnam and other commitments while fighting the “cold war”.</p>
<p>The US really should have paid more for &#8216;national security&#8217; in 1968, pay more by choosing the most expensive and profitable way of doing things like using an all volunteer force.</p>
<p>&#8216;National security&#8217; is so vital we should buy the top shelve brand for all its expectations no matter how expensive and unusual.</p>
<p>The commenter accused another poster of not knowing economics and failing to see the uncounted costs of the draft to the draftees and implicitly the community. That there are other issues is a fair point. All government actions have consequences, some intended, most not counted.</p>
<p>The consequences of conscription, colloquially the draft, include: benefits to the government; lower pay for the first term enlistees, reduced recruiting costs, faster growth in manning to respond to mobilization, hard to find skills join the uniformed services that might be too busy pursuing self interest, and a few more that do not come to mind.</p>
<p>There are some costs of the draft: higher turnover, more training (unless you do like WW II or lately with “stop loss” and draft for the duration) and a few more that do not come to mind. Costs to the individual include diverting plans and serving the nation, and maybe getting killed, maimed or psychologically disabled.</p>
<p>The draft seems to only benefit the government, of which we all are a part.</p>
<p>It is difficult to put firm costs or benefits to these. My conclusion from this exercise is the commenter was right and wrong. There are unmeasured consequences and outcomes. The commenter missed that when you consider soft outcomes there are two sides and they often balance or come close to equaling out.</p>
<p>There is a benefit to the general welfare from populating the military with draftees: they tend to balance out the influence of factions who see war as profit. Professional soldiers with the “for profit” suppliers see war as career and consider going off to battle is business development. No nation prospers in long wars; there are huge opportunity costs to continuously readying ourselves for war. Serving draftees provide needed a balance to the lifers.</p>
<p>As I thought about this I recalled the draft riots of 1863. One cause was the process where persons with resources could buy a “substitute” to serve in his place.</p>
<p>I see the current all volunteer force as the government hiring “substitutes” for persons who have &#8216;soft&#8217; reasons to have some one else fight their war for them.</p>
<p>The “substitutes” are now paid by the taxpayer and the benefits to the taxpayer are not acceptable.</p>
<p>The bottom lines in opposing the draft are: while draftees are cheaper, the opponents of the draft don&#8217;t want to give up their “substitutes” and draftees are dangerous to long war, for profit militarists.</p>
<p>The costs of today&#8217;s military operations do not matter as long as someone is making money. To take a note from Barry Goldwater: &#8216;Any profit in the most costly and inept defense of liberty no matter how wasted is not fraud.&#8217;</p>
<p>We have always made money at war.</p>
<p>The chickenhawks will get by by conning the taxpayer to buy their substitute.</p>
<p>But, why should the taxpayer buy a substitute for the chickenhawks?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;m with Kaiser Permanente for health insurance.  So is the Ex-GF.  We&#8217;re happy with it, as far as things go.</p>
<p>Now, regular readers may recall something I noted a while back&#8230; earlier this year, when the Ex-GF switched to Kaiser (she was with the Motion Picture health care plan &#8211; she used to be a ward-robe consultant, but hasn&#8217;t done that in a while), we ensured there was a six month period with overlapping service &#8211; just in case she got something in her first few months, we didn&#8217;t want her new service being cancelled as a result of some pre-existing condition of which we were completely unaware.  Ah, the wonders of the efficient American system, in which it is necessary sometimes not just to have one insurance policy, but two at the same time!  T</p>
<p>OK.  Fast forward to today.  We&#8217;ve been having issues putting the Ex-GF on direct deposit payment.  Today I decided to take care of it once and for all.  We got a form from Kaiser that I had to fill out&#8230; and it asked for one piece of information that wasn&#8217;t on her card or any of the bills &#8211; the &#8220;provider number.&#8221;  I believe that&#8217;s the code for the employer who pays the bills&#8230; but we pay for it ourselves.  So I spent about thirty minutes going through the maze that makes up their automatic phone system.  Eventually I spoke to a human.  And here is the problem&#8230; they wouldn&#8217;t tell me what her provider number was &#8211; I needed her permission.  But by then she had left to run some errands.  I explained &#8211; &#8220;listen, I&#8217;ve written every check for her account so far, and I don&#8217;t want any personal information.  Just tell me what the code is to put down on the form.  I want to pay the bills automatically.&#8221;  </p>
<p>No dice.  WTF?  I understand keeping personal information, and medical information private.  And how much she pays.  But I wasn&#8217;t asking for anything like that.</p>
<p>So end result&#8230;  an hour later, we called back Kaiser and went through the same rigmarole.  In order to get a number that has zero meaning to anyone except Kaiser and doesn&#8217;t in any way provide any information at all.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m satisfied with Kaiser.  But this system is ridiculous.  I estimate that so far this year, we&#8217;ve spent about $1,500 on overlapping (duplicate) insurance for the Ex-GF and who knows how much time on the phone getting the details to work out.  And our time has value too &#8211; I could be spending time consulting. These are the wonders of the efficient American system.</p>

<p>I was catching up on some blog reading and saw something interesting from <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/china/5/15/">Brad Setser</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a tendency to equate the RMB/ dollar with the RMB.   That most often shows up in tendency to equate an appreciation of the RMB against the dollar with an appreciation of the RMB.   That is a mistake.   If the dollar is depreciating against other currencies, the RMB can appreciate against the dollar and still depreciate against most of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad proposes the following currency measure:</p>
<blockquote><p>The following chart &#8211; which was inspired by a suggestion from former Treasury Secretary Summers &#8211; shows moves in the RMB against a  40% dollar/ 40% euro (used as a proxy for all European currencies) and a 20% yen basket.   That roughly matches the current composition of China’s trade with the G-3 once adjustments are made to account for the large share of China&#8217;s trade that goes through Hong Kong.   </p></blockquote>
<p>His G-3 basket is indexed such that June 2005 = 100. Brad’s chart shows some noise in his G-3 series but there has been almost no net change from June 2005 to September 2007.  We show the components by graphing how many yuan a dollar will buy, how many yuan the yen will buy, and how many yuans the Euro will buy – all indexed such that June 2005 = 100.  While the dollar has weakened by about 9 percent and the yen has weakened by about 14 percent, the value of the Euro with respect to the yuan has gone up by over 14 percent.  The value of the G-3 basket has therefore declined by less than one percent.  Brad compares the value of the yuan to a couple of other currencies as well.</p>

<p>The towns of Braintree, Hull, and others have declared water emergencies for use of water in the home (not the silly emergencies around lawn watering), declaring that they have only a three month supply in their resevoirs. Notice on the map our drought conditions in MA are only D-3 overall (severe).</p>
<p>Notice the Lakes area, and the Southwest as well of course the Southeast as advertized nationally. California fires have overshadowed the more important long range issue of drought for agriculture and hydrological crisis.</p>
<p>There have been posts on water, but mainly from city folk. Any farm or ranch people out there as well?</p>

And I note that other than the prescription for Vicodin (I never had that or any other mind-altering drug prescribed as far as I can remember), I could in all honesty state everything he&#8217;s stated.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Three things that I hope to see happen before I&#8217;m gone.</p>
<p>1. Unencumbered travel to Cuba.<br />2. Universal health care<br />3. Legalizing medical marijuana</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t drink, I&#8217;ve never smoked a cigarette in my life, I don&#8217;t take anything stronger than Sudafed. I&#8217;ve even had times when I have been prescribed Vicodin and I still don&#8217;t use it because it makes me feel stupid(er). And, no, you can&#8217;t have it, so don&#8217;t ask. But there may come a day when I will want something that will ease my pain without side-effects before I take that stroll down oblivion way.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Noni Mausa sends a link to <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20071027/mathtrek.asp">Science News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Predicting the future is not very hard, according to Bruce Bueno de Mesquita: a little mathematics is all you need. Figuring out how to manipulate a situation to achieve specific aims is a bit less straightforward, but Bueno de Mesquita says his mathematical tools can usually do that, too.</p>
<p>The New York University political science professor has developed a computerized game theory model that predicts the future of many business and political negotiations and also figures out ways to influence the outcome. Two independent evaluations, one by academics and one by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, have both shown that about 90 percent of his predictions have been accurate. Most recently, he has used his mathematical tools to offer approaches for handling the growing nuclear crisis with Iran.</p></blockquote>
<p> &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The elements of the model are players standing in for the real-life people who influence a negotiation or decision. At each round of the game, players make proposals to one or more of the other players and reject or accept proposals made to them. Through this process, the players learn about one another and adapt their future proposals accordingly. Each player incurs a small cost for making a proposal. Once the accepted proposals are good enough that no player is willing to go to the trouble to make another proposal, the game ends. The accepted proposals are the predicted outcome.</p>
<p>To accommodate the vagaries of human nature, the players are cursed with divided souls. Although all the players want to get their own preferred policies adopted, they also want personal glory. Some players are policy-wonks who care only a little about glory, while others resemble egomaniacs for whom policies are secondary. Only the players themselves know how much they care about each of those goals. An important aspect of the negotiation process is that by seeing which proposals are accepted or rejected, players are able to figure out more about how much other players care about getting their preferred policy or getting the glory. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>One of his most famous past predictions also concerned Iran. In 1984, the model predicted that when Ayatollah Khomeini died, an ayatollah named Hojatolislam Khameini and a little-known cleric named Hasheimi Rafsanjani would rise to succeed Khomeini as leaders of Iran. At the time, most experts considered that outcome exceedingly unlikely, since Khomeini had designated a different person as his successor. But in fact, when Khomeini died five years later, Rafsanjani and Khameini succeeded him.</p>
<p>Bueno de Mesquita says he also predicted that Andropov would succeed Brezhnev long before experts considered it likely. He foresaw that China would reclaim Hong Kong 12 years before it happened, and he predicted that France would narrowly pass the European Union&#8217;s Maastricht Treaty. </p></blockquote>
<p>Assuming this guy is for real (i.e., that his prediction can be verified&#8230;  also, how good those predictions were (I&#8217;m not sure how unlikely betting on Andropov was even five years before Brezhnev died, since at that time he was heading the KGB, and he managed to amass so much information the rest of the Politburo wanted him booted up&#8230; now, I&#8217;m no Sovietologist, but had he picked Chernenko to succeed Andropov a year before it happened&#8230;)) I&#8217;d love to see his tool.</p>
