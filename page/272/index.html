<p><strong>Discouraging Greg Mankiw From Working Would be Good for the Economy</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">the Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>A few days ago Greg Mankiw had an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/business/economy/10view.html?_r=1&#038;scp=1&#038;sq=greg%20mankiw&#038;st=cse">op ed piece in the NY Times</a> talking about how even small increases in the marginal tax rate would keep him (and by extension, other talented folks like him) from working.  </p>
<p>For a laugh, I pulled data on the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175910,00.html">top marginal tax rate from the IRS</a> and <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2010&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaBox=no#Mid">real GDP per capita from the BEA&#8217;s NIPA tables</a>.  Data on the latter goes back to 1929, and the tax rate info goes back further.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />It turns out that the correlation between the tax rate in any given year and the growth rate in real GDP per capita from that year to the next is small but positive.  That is, higher top marginal tax rates don&#8217;t seem to reduce real economic growth.  Look at the tax rate and the annualized growth rate in real GDP per capita for two years, or three, or four, or five, or six (which is as far as I went) and ditto &#8211; the higher the marginal tax rate, the faster the economic growth over the next X years.  The correlation is positive, if small.</p>
<p>Now, you may be saying to yourself &#8211; sure, but the world is very different now than in 1929 or 1942 or 1968.  What about in recent times?   So let&#8217;s start in 1981, which is more or less when a) the ideas that Mankiw endorses took hold and b) Mankiw&#8217;s career began.  Here&#8217;s what that looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TLhIs172YgI/AAAAAAAAAbw/PdDLWib4tC0/s1600/mankiw1.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TLhIs172YgI/AAAAAAAAAbw/PdDLWib4tC0/s320/mankiw1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1.</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;  a clear positive correlation between the top marginal tax rate and the growth in real GDP per capita over the next four years.  Using three or five year lags decreases the correlation slightly but results are about the same.  It would seem that discouraging Mr. Mankiw from working would be a very, very good thing for the economy.  That shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise to you if you&#8217;ve read <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">my book</a> and maybe I&#8217;ll write a bit more about this when I get a chance.  </p>
<p>However, while it may seem like I&#8217;m being facetious about how discouraging Mankiw from working would be good for the economy, I really believe it.  After all, Mankiw&#8217;s work consists in large part of advocating a position in his books, lectures, op eds, and as an advisor that, as the graph above shows, is consistent with slower economic growth, and he&#8217;s very good at what he does.</p>

                                <p>&#8230;Corporations. Since earnings season is now well underway, I decided to look at the breakdown of aggregate domestic income (gross domestic income). Corporate profits are up 44.7% since the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/main.html">outset of the US recovery</a>, while wages and salary accruals are up just 0.9%.</p>
<p><img border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TLcmy_NMcoI/AAAAAAAADSk/Y3ri0cXBUYQ/s400/GDI_components.PNG">The chart above illustrates the peak-trough losses (total loss), trough-Q2 2010 gains (total gain), and peak-Q2 (relative to peak) deviations of <a href="http://bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=51&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010">nominal gross domestic income</a>, disaggregated by income type.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>First up, wages and salaries (employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and of employer contributions for government social insurance) and private enterprises net of corporate profit incomes grew in sum spanning the recession (private enterprises net of corporate profits includes proprietor&#8217;s income, which did fall). Furthermore, the drop in wage and salary accruals, -3.6%, was small compared to the drop in corporate profits, -18.1%.</p>
<p>Second, the corporate profit gains during the recovery massively outweigh the wage and salary gains over the same period, 44.7% versus 0.9%. Corporate profits are now 18.5% above the peak in 2007 IV, while wages and salaries hover 2.8% below.</p>
<p>The problem here is, that the deleveraging cycle is heavily weighted on the household sector (the workers at the corporations) &#8211; if corporate profit gains do not translate into hiring and wage gains, or even to further capital spending, economic growth will suffer going forward.</p>
<p>Better put, at the very minimum, the recent surge in corporate profits is not sustainable if firms do not distribute the gains to the real economy. Also, meager wage gains does make <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/04/reducing-household-financial-leverage.html">healthy deleveraging </a>difficult for household sector. Therefore, the recent surge in gross domestic income (hence, it&#8217;s spending counterpart, GDP) is not sustainable if corporate profits are not recycled.</p>

<p>When academics write about our own experiences in op-eds and blog posts, we risk making a common error&#8211;assuming that we can view ourselves objectively and that we can rationally dissect the pros and cons of our own situations as illustrative of humanity in general or at least of &#8220;typical&#8221; people in our circumstances.  What we all tend to do is overlook obvious counterarguments to the position we espouse based on our own proclivities. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Talking about the potential lapse of the Bush tax cuts that were overly generous for the wealthy seems to be one of those areas where the trap lurks.  Todd Henderson, a Chicago prof with an apparent income of upwards of $350,000 a year, whined about not being &#8220;rich&#8221; because he was barely able to afford luxuries that wealthy citizens enjoy (a landscaper to tend his lawn, a housekeeper to tend his house, etc.) and would have less discretionary funds to spend if he were to have to pay taxes at the pre-Bush rates.  See, e.g.,  Brad DeLong, <a target="_blank" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/09/in-which-mr-deling-responds-to-someone-who-might-be-professor-todd-henderson.html">In Which Mr. Deling Responds to Someone Who Might Be Professor XXXX XXXXXXXXX</a>, Sept. 18, 2010 (includes the original post by professor Henderson as well as a stinging commentary); Michael O&#8217;Hare, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.samefacts.com/2010/09/economics/the-whining-of-the-rich/">The Whining of the Rich</a>, Sept. 18, 2010;  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.read-news.info/financial/the-whining-rich/">The Whining Rich</a>, ReadNews, Sept 21, 2010.  As many noted afterwards, people tend to evaluate their circumstances in terms of those who have more: studies show that even multimillionaires think they need about double to be &#8220;secure&#8221;.   Henderson didn&#8217;t stop to recognize that most Americans would be delighted to be in his circumstances, and for many of them it would be a dramatic change towards a better standard of living.  If you are working two jobs to support a family of four and still have to make priority decisions between buying new jeans for your first-grader or buying better food for the toddler, then the idea of having several hundred of discretionary dollars a month after the luxuries Henderson reported as his necessary &#8220;expenses&#8221; (much of which was actually savings) would seem incredibly wonderful. </p>
<p>Mankiw, I think, has fallen into that trap, too.  See Mankiw, I can afford higher taxes, but they&#8217;ll make me work less, New York Times, Oct. 9, 2010.  He notes that &#8220;Republicans say raising taxes on those who already face the highest marginal tax rates will hurt the economy&#8221; and proposes a case study&#8211;himself.  He acknowledges up fron that he &#8220;can afford to pay more in taxes&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t &#8220;have trouble making ends meet.&#8221; </p>
<p>(Dan here&#8230;also see <a target="_blank" href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/10/ego-or-money.html">Economist&#8217;s View &#8211; Is it really the money?</a></p>
<p>Nonetheless, as Republicans emphasize, taxes influence the decisions I make. I am regularly offered opportunities to earn extra money. It could be by talking to a business group, consulting on a legal case, giving a guest lecture, teaching summer school or writing an article. I turn down most but accept a few.</p>
<p>And I acknowledge that my motives in taking on extra work are partly mercenary. I don’t want to move to a bigger house or buy that Ferrari, but I hope to put some money aside for my three children.</p>
<p>He claims that if he is offered $1000, his taxes, the corporate tax on his stock investments (treated as directly reducing his dividends and capital gains from the stock), a low rate of return, and estate taxes mean that his kids with get &#8220;at most, $1000&#8221; from his current $1000, making the opportunity not worthwhile.   Therefore, he will decline more service opportunities if the tax rate increases and all Americans will &#8220;bear the burden&#8221;, since their favorite singer, surgeon, orthodontist or others will provide fewer services.</p>
<p>He assumes a tax rate of 39.5% (highest federal rate) plus 1.2% because of the phase out of deductions at high income levels plus medicare tax of 3.8% plus Massachusetts income tax of 5.3% (minus an unspecified return because of the federal deduction), claiming that leaves him $523 out of the $1000.  He says that without any taxes, his corporate stock would provide a return of 8%, while he claims that with corporate taxes he only gets a 5.2% return&#8211;asserting that the corporation &#8220;pays a 35% corporate tax on its earnings&#8221;.   He pays taxes on that income, so he claims his after-tax income on his investment is only 4%, resulting in $1700 after 30 years, which he claims is hit by the estate tax at a high marginal rate (he assumes somewhere below 55%), leaving his kids about $1000.</p>
<p>This analysis misses at least a few points (in addition to the fact that hardly anyone pays an effective tax rate equal to the statutory rate, once all the relevant provisions are taken into account, including deductible expenses to generate income, etc.).  </p>
<p>•As to the basic premise of declining opportunities merely because the tax rate increases:  Mankiw may have sufficient income and insufficient cravings for more to decline opportunities for more pay more readily than others, as he states, but there is an inconsistency between his stated goal of having more to pass on to his children and declining even more opportunities because of an increased tax on the opportunities accepted.  Assuming his calculations are accurate and that he really wants to pass on more to his kids, then he can&#8217;t really be sure that he would pass up the opportunity to work a little bit more to have more.  He claims his kids will be $1000 richer for his working, and that means $1000 poorer if he doesn&#8217;t take the opportunity.  If his kids&#8217; wellbeing is his only goal, then if there is no new tax cut that effectively extends the Bush tax cuts he&#8217;s enjoyed for most of the last decade it appears he would likely take that job and figure that $1000 is better than nothing.  In fact, because of the increased tax bite, if his goal is really raising the amount available to his kids, he should take two opportunities now for every one opportunity that he took when the Bush tax cuts were operational to his benefit.<br />•As to corporate tax:  Even many corporations that earn significant economic income pay absolutely zero in corporate taxes because of the many loopholes/tax expenditures in the Code and the ability to manipulate their taxes through agressive transfer pricing.  Even corporations that end up paying taxes don&#8217;t pay taxes at the statutory rate on their full economic income&#8211;the average effective corporate tax rate in the US is somewhere around or below 25% (varying depending on industries).   And of course a corporation can change its policies on  retention or distribution of profits taking into consideration the relationship between corporate taxation and shareholder taxation.  And what about the incidence of corporate tax?  Is it passed on in full to shareholders, as Mankiw presumes?  That&#8217;s not so clear as he suggests.<br />•As to estate tax:  Mankiw disregards the fact that there will likely be a significant exemption under any new estate tax law that might replace the return of the 2001 estate tax as legislated under the Bush tax cuts.  It will likely be an exemption of more than $1 million, perhaps as much as $3.5 million (double for a couple).  So that $1700 won&#8217;t be taxed at 55%.  The effective tax rate on most estates that are actually taxed (ie, have some estate in excess of the exemption) is much lower than 55%, so the effective tax could be around 14% (depending on the size of Mankiw&#8217;s estate and his willingness to engage in estate planning).<br />•As to the calculated no-tax-at-all 8% return from his corporate stock investment:  there are many issues here, but the biggest problem is Mankiw&#8217;s total disregard of the impact of non-taxation&#8211;or just insufficient taxation&#8211; on the his corporation&#8217;s business and his own ability to earn income from speaking, writing and whatever.  Most countries with ineffective tax systems find themselves unable to function appropriately.  Ineffective markets because of the lack of appropriate governmental limitations would be a certainty.  Both the speaking engagements and the corporate profits might well vaporize in a no-tax or even an insufficient tax world.  Since the wealthy like Mankiw benefit significantly from government and receive preferential tax treatment on their financial assets (of which they own the vast majority), they would be the most negatively impacted by the lack of appropriate government safeguards.<br />In short,  Mankiw admits that he already makes one-on-one decisions about which opportunities he will pursue, and chooses to pursue few.  He claims that taxes would lead him to choose to pursue even fewer, based on his calculations of the taxes on that incremental income, even though his reason for pursuing any opportunities at all is to set aside money for his children&#8217;s future.   Clearly, there are lots of tradeoffs to be made, and various factors come into these decisions (taxes, leisure, desire for status, etc.).  As others have noted (see comments on TaxProf posting), someone  with Mankiw&#8217;s economic training and in his sought-after position should know how to bargain for the after-tax return he desires and be able to do so because of his considerable bargaining power.  And as I&#8217;ve noted here, having a bigger tax bite should work as an incentive to work more, not less, if his goal is really to provide more for his kids. </p>
<p>But let&#8217;s assume that it is possible that he would turn down more posts if there were an incremental increase in his tax rates due to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts.  In that case, does that mean that the economy suffers, as Mankiw asserts?  He suggests that when stars turn down additional earning opportunities, the not-rich bear the burden because the service provided is simply not available.  But in fact that is when competition increases, which economists usually argue is good for economic growth.  For every surgeon who turns down yet another operation, a path is opened for another surgeon to gain expertise and higher pay.  (And the up-and-coming surgeon may even turn out not only to be available at a bargain, but a better surgeon more familiar with newer techniques.) For every speaker who turns down a speaking engagement, another with competent qualifications is waiting in the wings to become a star (or at least receive this incremental increase to compensation).  The economy is in fact served by spreading the service opportunities across more people and allowing more people to develop a level of expertise that is worthy of higher compensation, instead of allowing a few &#8220;stars&#8221; to garner all the income.  That is the way we achieved dramatic growth in the post-war years. </p>
<p>So go to it, Mankiw.  Turn &#8217;em all down, so that budding young economists&#8211;maybe even some women and people of color for a change&#8211;will have their chance in the limelight.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>“The Supreme Court, issuing its first orders accepting cases for the new Term, on Tuesday edged toward analysis of the government’s authority to label information it has as a “state secret” and thus to prevent its disclosure in court. It will do so, though, only in a narrow context: the rights of defense contractors. The issue in two cases brought by major defense contractors is whether it is unconstitutional for the government to invoke the “state secrets” doctrine in a way that prevents a contractor from defending itself against a claim it did not live up to its contract.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>— <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/09/a-review-of-state-secrets/">SCOTUSblog, Sept. 28, 2010</a><br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In an article featured on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2270524/pagenum/all/#p2">Slate, Dahlia Lithwick</a> reports on Justice Clarence Thomas’s wife Ginni’s appearance at the Virginia Tea Party Patriots Convention on Friday. Ginni Thomas is an activist in the Tea Party and has started a web site called Liberty Central that accepts (apparently large) donations from secret donors that probably include CEOs and other top executives of large corporations. It also undoubtedly includes lobbyists. As in, Washington lobbyists.</p>
<p>Lithwick’s article is titled “The Battle Cry of a Supreme Court Wife” and subtitled “When Ginni Thomas rails against Washington elites, does it include her husband?” The gist of Thomas’s speech on Friday was screed was that powerful Washington elites see “the Constitution as an impediment to having power over our lives.&#8221; And at least with regard to the conservatives on the Supreme Court, she’s right. Thomas’s husband regularly joins with his conservative colleagues to undermine some of the most basic protections afforded to individuals by the Constitution. </p>
<p>An outsized percentage of the tiny number of cases that the Court agrees to hear each year are cases that a government entity—the federal government or a state of local government—or a government official or employee has asked the Court to hear, and in which the Court almost always has agreed to hear he case with the intent to rule in favor of the government or government official in a way that narrows or eliminates individuals’ rights to, say, be free of unreasonable searches or seizures of the individual by the government, or that further increases the already expansive Court-created immunities that governments and their employees have from lawsuit liability, or—a personal favorite or Ginni’s husband’s—removes constitutional restraints against states vis-à-vis individuals because Justice Thomas and his conservative colleagues believe that, as he has put it, the “dignity” of the states trumps the dignity of the individual. </p>
<p>In the view of that crowd, the Constitution is not an impediment to the governments’ power over our lives only if the power that the government wants to have over our lives concerns a “taking” of our real estate by, say, environmental rules; infringement of our right to practice our religion by, say, cooping a public school classroom to do it; or buying or owning a gun.</p>
<p>Or if the lives over which the government wants power are corporate lives. </p>
<p>As those of us who watch the Supreme Court closely know, the Court (by its own admission) looks the other way year after year, sometimes for a decade or two, as the lower courts interpret particular procedural or substantive rules of law in a way that violates the constitutional rights of parties to litigation, suddenly agreeing to hear a case that presents that issue only because it is, say, an oil company, or a tobacco company, or a defense contractor, represented by a member of a tiny claque of highly prestigious and extremely expensive Washington-based Supreme Court “specialists”, most of whom once served as law clerks for a Supreme Court justice. </p>
<p>Like standard-issue lobbyists who pedal access to legislators or members of the executive branch, these lawyers sell access to the justices; petitions bearing their names as counsel will be read by some of the justices; few other petitions, in civil cases or criminal ones, will be. </p>
<p>Except, of course, those filed on behalf of a government or government official or employee. Especially if they are asking the Court to limit yet further the constitutional rights of individuals or to expand still more the immunity from liability for governments and their employees. </p>
<p>It is no coincidence that the Court has agreed at the request of General Dynamics and Boeing, in petitions field for them by members of the Supreme Court specialist crowd, to consider whether the government’s lawsuit against these companies should have been dismissed on constitutional-due-process-of-law grounds, once the trial court ruled that under the state-secrets privilege the government could withhold information that might have helped these companies defend themselves in breach-of-contract cases filed by the government. </p>
<p>The Court has refused to hear constitutional challenges to trial courts’ dismissals of lawsuits by individuals because of the expansive state-secrets privilege; the government claimed that in order to defend itself against the claims, it would have to disclose state secrets, so the lawsuits must be dismissed. The Court’s agreement to hear the General Dynamics and Boeing cases, in which the two corporations were defendants in lawsuits filed against them by the government, is not inconsistent with its refusal to hear the cases of the individuals whose lawsuits against the government were dismissed under the state secrets privilege. But it is a safe bet that when the Court rules in favor of the corporations next spring, it will do so in an opinion so narrow that it applies only to corporations sued by the government in a breach-of contract case. </p>
<p>Or at least, that that is how the lower courts will interpret the ruling, and will be allowed to interpret the ruling, for years and years. Until another mega corporation, represented by a Supreme Court specialist, asks the Court to clarify that the rule of law also applies in other types of cases in which corporations are sued by the government.</p>

<p><strong>How exactly do you create a job? Raising and Training Omadiki</strong></p>
<p>How exactly do you create a job?  The president is blamed for not doing it (but warned not to do it directly.)  Business is exhorted to do it, (but not blamed for not doing it.)  But what is the “it” that they are not doing?</p>
<p>A big heap of Lego blocks, piled on the floor, are mere caltrops to the unwary new parent.  But with a little imagination, the blocks link up and can take the form of people, machines or even animals.  Given enough blocks and a little ingenuity, the range of forms they can assume seems endless.</p>
<p>In human societies each person is a highly complicated Lego block, and each employed person is someone who has found a spot in a structure and helps animate it.  This creation of powerful “living” structures out of many participants is a skill like no other species on our planet.  To reify this sort of structure is difficult in English, since the words “team,” “crew,” “corporation,” and others all have precise meanings that don’t embrace the whole set.  So, when in doubt, go check the Greek.  And there we find the word omadiki, “group,” all handy to be stolen, ahem &#8220;adopted&#8221; for the purpose.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>To create a job, it appears, will almost always mean to create or augment an omadik -a structure animated by people.  Simple examples of these structures include a football team, a university, a bakery or an army. The payoff to participating in, supporting or at least tolerating such structures is HUGE.</p>
<p>(Let’s call these jobs “derived” jobs.  There are also “direct” jobs which don’t participate in such structures, but may or may not depend on their existence.  For now, let’s just look at the derived jobs.)</p>
<p>Lego blocks are static and undemanding.  Human beings are far from static, and ornery.  However, keeping that in mind perhaps our omadiki model of employment can be some use.</p>
<p>Individual people, unlike most wild animals, have a difficult time living well only on the efforts of their own hands.  But as we begin to link up, our productivity rises so abruptly that above a certain low population and resource threshold we begin to create more value than we can use.  Scarcity is no longer the problem – storage and distribution is.</p>
<p>Heresy!  Isn’t scarcity the foundational concept of economics?  Maybe so, but I don’t believe it.  As witness I cite countries like Zimbabwe, where the populace is desperately poor but there is still enough productivity excess to needs to support a small but sumptuous upper class.  It is excess-to-needs which creates an upper class, and how many countries do you know that do not have one of those?</p>
<p>Society is an interaction of many omadiki.  Each exists only so long as it retains the participation of enough people.  Of course people, and thus the constructs they animate, depend on some of the common produce being returned to them as sustenance.  But the fraction of total productivity needed for this is not large.  And it’s participation of people, not their prosperity, or their direct profit from a given omadik, which keeps such constructs alive.</p>
<p>Omadiki which do not return their share of sustenance are, by definition, free riders &#8212; predators or parasites, or (in many, many cases) pets. All ecosystems have free riders.  We have lots.  And humans have supported lots of free riders for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Our excess-to-needs allows long periods of childhood and retirement, supports artists and thinkers, many poor people and many people who have situated themselves in society so as to tap off some of the excess. We care for our disabled and elderly, and we imprison rather than kill or exile our transgressors.</p>
<p>The support extends to our draft animals, our omadiki. We maintain expensive pets like symphony orchestras, arctic expeditions, WWI air museums, and partisan think tanks, and still have plenty for all.</p>
<p>Not scarcity, but excess, is the essence of our economy.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, this excess is a big problem for feral omadiki, the parasites and predators among our constructs.  They rely on human participation for their existence, as do the domesticated omadiki.  And there is surplus for all.  But, they want to benefit from the productivity of their participants while giving back as little as possible.  Ideally, they want individuals to draw their sustenance elsewhere, and work as volunteers for the parasites.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, this isn’t quite true.  Omadiki simply want to persist.  But people are fickle, distractible and ornery.  What if they decide they don’t want to be on the team any more?  What if they run off to join another, more comfortable omadik?  What if your liver or your gall bladder decided to spend July in the south of France, or all your cells took off to forge new careers as individual protista in the leaf litter?  They not only need us, but cannot exist without us.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the current paradox.  On the one hand, millions of people without a spot as part of an omadik, on the other hand thousands of omadiki either undersized or not existing at all.  Their non-existence is not a threat to America, because the productivity of the existing omadiki is excess-to-needs, more now than ever in history.</p>
<p>But right now, more than ever, it is nearly impossible for an individual to access sustenance, or hold social status, unless they have a good spot in an omadik.  This is the gap between the individual and the excess-to-needs – the scarcity at the core of conventional economics that obliges him to participate even when the return is equal to or less than the effort he expends.  Part of this coercion lies in convincing individuals that omadiki are the source of sustenance, rather than the gatekeepers of sustenance and creators of scarcity.  God knows that is well in hand.</p>
<p>And finally, of course the excess-to-needs doesn’t go to the omadik, it being imaginary.  It goes to those who ride the creature like a mahout on an elephant’s neck, and to those who manage the mahouts.  But that is a different post.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;ve been working on White Paper on Liquidity and the idea of a &#8220;market,&#8221; and plan to post some pieces of it here over the next week or so.</p>
<p>But this is too good to pass up, and I&#8217;m late to the game as is.</p>
<p>On 15 September, the CFTC and the SEC held a joint &#8220;public roundtable discussion&#8221; on Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs).  Part 1 is <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/openmeetings/2010/jac091510-panel1.asx">here</a>, Part 2 <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/openmeetings/2010/jac091510-panel2.asx">here</a>.</p>
<p>What is most amazing, if you didn&#8217;t pay attention to the markets, is how few actual transactions occur in the &#8220;derivatives market&#8221;—at least according to people who work in the Industry and are discussants.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the Credit Swaps Market. According to ISDA, the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?sid=a4AtVMqwawtc&#038;pid=newsarchive">Credit Default Swaps Market in 2009 declined to $38.6 trillion</a>; that&#8217;s $38,600,000,000,000, give or take forty or fifty billion.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Sounds like a lot, no? Strangely, there&#8217;s virtually no liquidity associated with that $38.6T. According to the testimony in Part 1, the most frequently traded CDS—GE, presumably because they bring good things to life (or at least have DoD contracts)—trades around 15 times a day.  That might be impressive for a penny stock, but it&#8217;s not exactly the type of thing that makes you think &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s a market!&#8221;</p>
<p>The implications are clear: the bid-offer will be wide (think FX rates from your local bank, or gold prices from <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/07/glenn-beck-goldline/">Goldline</a>), the loss when one tries to get out of the trade makes &#8220;driving a new car off the lot&#8221; look like a blip, and any dispute will be resolved against your favor.</p>
<p>In short, there is—and should be—very little retail demand for these products, for very good reason.  Paul Volcker&#8217;s description of <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2009/12/08/volcker-praises-the-atm-blasts-finance-execs-experts/">the ATM as the only financial innovation in the past 25 years that helped people</a> has never seemed so true.</p>

<p>A new Washington Post, Kaiser Family Foundation, Harvard <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/Post-Kaiser-Harvard-Role-of-Government-2010.pdf">poll</a> of US opinions on the role of government reminds me that actual people in the US have progressive views on the role of government.</p>

<p>commentary after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Of course part of the issue is that people want the Federal government to do more and spend less.  However, there are narrower majorities which stress the fact that there are no free lunches. by 50% to 46% a plurality (or majority) thinks considers more important &#8220;increasing federal spending to try to create jobs and improfe the economy&#8221; than &#8220;avoiding a big increase in the federal budget deficit&#8221;. A 49 to 47% plurality wants the federal government to provide &#8220;more services even if it costs more in taxes&#8221; than wants fewer services and less taxes.</p>
<p>The results of the poll are hard to reconcile with the positions of the parties on these issues and declared voting intentions.  Clearly a large part of the difference is due to the fact that this is a poll of adults not of likely voters or even registered voters.</p>
<p>I have the jpg of a bit of the pdf, because I was <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2010/10/unsubtle-contradictory-statements-this.html">outraged</a> at the description of hte results on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/09/AR2010100903308.html">the front page </a>of www.washingtonpost.com. Part of the article clearly referred to question 10</p>
<blockquote><p>They [most Americans] want Washington to be involved in schools and to help reduce poverty. Nearly half want the government to maintain a role in regulating health care.  </p></blockquote>
<p>That description is, in my view, false, since it described support for more involvement as support for any involvement.</p>
<p>And then the respondents decide to blow my mind.</p>
<p>Pluralities at least take the fiscally liberal position on taxing and spending.  The questions on taxes are all about generally high or low taxes and not who&#8217;s taxes should be hihgh and who&#8217;s low, and I know that there is very strong support among US adults for increased tax progressivity. So why do many more Americans call themselves conservatives than liberals ?  I always believed that it was because they were socially conservative, maybe not even taking conservative issues on public policy on social issues but considered their personal morality conservative.</p>
<p>I have long been totally wrong.  The poll ends asking if the respondent is liberal moderate or conservative three ways&#8211; politically, fiscally or socially.  Not only do many more people describe themselves as fiscally conservative than as fiscally liberal, but many more people describe themselves as fiscally conservative than describe themselves as socially conservative.  here is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/Post-Kaiser-Harvard-Role-of-Government-2010.pdf">the link </a>to the poll again.</p>
<p>This is in the same poll where a minority considers taxes more important than government services and in which a minority considers the deficit less important that increasing spending to try to stimulate the economy.  I am puzzled.  There isn&#8217;t a logical contradiction as all can be explained if fiscal moderates agree with fiscal liberals on those issues, but I don&#8217;t know what the respondents dislike about the word liberal.  I thought it was our loose morals, but then I can&#8217;t explain the answers to the final question.</p>
