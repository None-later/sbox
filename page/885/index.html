<blockquote>Lucas writes that the promised benefits under the current system cannot be met with only the revenues that are brought in through the payroll tax. By 2030, Social Security obligations will consume 17 percent of payroll, compared to 11 percent today. General revenue, which is derived mostly from income taxes, will have to make up the difference &#8230; Personal accounts will alleviate this affliction, but certainly not cure it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Santoliquido refers to a previous set of lies from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZDJhMWRhYTg3N2MwOGI2ODljZDM1ZTFlZWI4MDQyM2E=">Carrie Lukas</a>, which we addressed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/social-security-another-what-trust-fund.html">here</a>. We’ve gone over these two issues repeatedly.  There is a Social Security Trust Fund reserve that the National Review simply ignores.  And privatization does not create funds out of thin air.  Assuming that the folks at the National Review are not complete idiots (one has to wonder) – do they think repeating their lies ad nausam will make them true?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/washington/14attorneys.html">Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Jeff Zeleny</a> have a nice run down on how President Bush wants to insulate himself from the prosecutor firing scandal.  AG Gonzales takes “responsibility” but not blame.  It was all D. Kyle Sampson’s fault.  It is absurd to believe that Sampson did this by himself.  So I believe Gonzales must resign.   But as we see from this story, now the blame is being put on Harriet Miers who was not part of the Justice Department as she was White House Counsel.  </p>
<p>And of course, Dan Bartlett offers us this lie:<br />
<blockquote>With Mr. Bush traveling in Mexico, the White House insisted that the president’s role had been minimal and laid the blame primarily on Harriet E. Miers, who was White House counsel when the prosecutors lost their jobs and who stepped down in January. “The White House did not play a specific role in the list of the seven U.S. attorneys,” said Dan Bartlett, Mr. Bush’s counselor, referring to a Justice Department roster of those to be dismissed. But he said the White House, through Ms. Miers’s office, ultimately “signed off on the list.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Further down in the story, it seems the real concern to this White House is whether this scandal will damage Bush himself.  The probability that AG Gonzales will be forced out of office looks pretty high to me.  That’s what one gets when one does Bush’s bidding.  When trouble brews, it’s time to throw another pawn under the bus.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://tbogg.blogspot.com/2007/03/buh-bye-berto-reviews-are-in.html">Tbogg</a> is placing a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/markets-in-everything-betting-on-white.html">bet</a> on the day we’ll see the AG resign.<br />
<blockquote>If they&#8217;ve lost Cornyn, &#8216;Berto is a goner. I&#8217;m guessing Friday afternoon&#8230; late in the day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good luck Tbogg!</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTQxZjQ0YjQ1OGRiMjg0OWQ2MzMzZTE2MTQyMTUwNmQ=">Andy McCarthy</a> argues:<br />
<blockquote>Now, no matter what you think of Gonzales&#8217;s performance, it would be a travesty to allow him to be forced out because the opposition has turned the USAtty fiasco into a referendum on abuse of presidential power.  As there has been absolutely no abuse, they shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to win &#8211; which makes it all the more infuriating that Gonzales, if it would make the problem go away, seems only too eager to surrender an important executive prerogative, namely, the authority of the president, rather than the court, to appoint interim U.S. attorneys pending senate confirmation. </p></blockquote>
<p>No abuse of power?  Is McCarthy spinning or just utterly clueless?</p>

                                <p>I’m sad to see <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/13/AR2007031301763.html">Senator Kent Conrad</a> endorses fiscal irresponsibility:<br />
<blockquote>Senate Democrats unveiled a spending blueprint yesterday that envisions a massive expansion of the nation&#8217;s health-insurance program for children, as well as billions of additional dollars for other domestic priorities such as public education, veterans&#8217; health care and local police. Despite the additional spending, Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said the proposal would virtually erase the federal deficit within four years without raising taxes and produce a surplus of $132 billion by 2012.  Under that scenario, Conrad said, Congress could extend President Bush&#8217;s signature tax cuts past their 2010 expiration date and halt the expansion of the alternative minimum tax, but only if sufficient revenue is raised elsewhere to cover the cost of about $800 billion over five years. &#8220;We believe some of the tax cuts will be extended. Perhaps all of them will be,&#8221; Conrad said during a late-afternoon briefing for reporters at his Capitol Hill office. &#8220;You can extend any or all of them, if you pay for them.&#8221; Conrad was vague on the details of how that might be accomplished. Possible sources for the extra cash, he said, include improving taxpayer compliance, eliminating offshore tax havens and conducting a top-to-bottom overhaul of the tax system.  The briefing yesterday, billed as a preview of a budget document that is to be released today to the Senate Budget Committee, marks the beginning of a months-long attempt by the new Democratic majority to craft an alternative to Bush&#8217;s spending plan for the budget year that begins in October. It also marks another step to restore discipline to the congressional budget process, which has faltered badly over the past decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the Senator wants to restore fiscal discipline, he pretends we can extend these tax “cuts” (read deferrals) and have more government spending.  How is that possible?  The answer may lie in who wrote this WaPo article – Lori Montgomery.  I suspect the Senator is talking about the unified surplus (deficit) which includes the increasing Social Security surplus.  Of course, Lori Montgomery might ask “what Social Security surplus”?  But I would like to see the Senator’s proposal scored in terms of the General Fund DEFICIT.  Our friend <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/03/more_budget_confusion_from_the.html#015865">Dean Baker</a> would want us to cast these figures in terms of percent of GDP.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: My thanks to AB reader CoRev for letting us know that the <a href="http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2007/03/balanced_budget.html">Skeptical Optimist</a> is still doing his silly trend line forecasts:<br />
<blockquote>Balanced budget trend: still June 2008 &#8230; one of the quickest ways to slow down or halt the growth of tax receipts would be the prospect of a tax rate hike. <br />Assuming nominal tax revenues and nominal spending continue to grow at the rates indicated by his trend lines, then the Social Security surplus will match the deficit in the rest of the Federal budget.  Of course, there is no reason to believe the assumption that nominal tax revenues and nominal spending continue to grow at the rates indicated by his trend lines.  After all, the temperatures in LA today will be about 10 degrees cooler than yesterday.  If this trend continues, I’ll have to go buy a heavy winter coat for the weekend.</p></blockquote>
<p>And of course, Skeptical Optimist is about as dumb as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/was-2003-tax-cut-responsible-for-recent.html">Lawrence Kudlow</a> when it comes to the effect of tax rates on economic growth.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This blog has some smart readers.  Sure, many of you are not economists, but nobody is perfect.  Many of you, whether or economists or not, have something to say that is interesting to say about the economy or economic issues.  In many cases, its just a question or series of questions, in other cases, it’s the answer to a question.  </p>
<p>Over the past few months, I have encouraged readers to write guest blogs, and I’ve posted these guest blogs.  I hope the practice continues.  But I’d also like to encourage those of you who wish to become more regular contributors to follow your dream of becoming, well, a regular contributor here at Angry Bear.  And (suggestion courtesy of reader Movie Guy) I’d like to ask for volunteers for something else.  Regular readers know PGL always has something to say about the BLS unemployment report release.  Perhaps you are interested in inflation, or money supply, or something else for which there is a regular release.  Why not be the “Angry Bear designated writer” on that topic?  Whenever a report comes out, link to it and write up a brief post.  Tell us whether the number was expected, and what it means.  </p>
<p>Sure, blogging takes time.  But I can say from experience, it’s a lot of fun, and you learn a lot in the process.  And if you decide to write a weekly post, or a bi-weekly post, it isn’t a big time commitment, but you’ll be helping the blog grow.  And you’ll have the opportunity to flesh out your ideas and guide the discussion.</p>
<p>As to content – just look to recent guest posts.  A very wide variety of topics have been covered.  As to attitude &#8211; Angry Bear has designated the blog “left of center.”  But some of the guest posts have been written by decidedly right of center readers.  There is no reason why we can’t have a right of center regular either.</p>
<p>Please e-mail me if you’re interested in helping make Angry Bear all that it can be.  (Note – I’ll be out until Thursday, so you might not get a response from me until then.)</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>OK.  If you’ve been awake in the past six years, you know the first three years of the GW term were pretty awful.  You also know the second three years were adequate.  (For a look at GW’s performance, and that of other Presidents, see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and_05.html">here</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I haven’t run any numbers, and I’ve been swamped lately, but I would guess that the next couple of years of the GW administration will show, at best, adequate growth.  I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s some major tanking in the economy within the next two years either.  Like the other Republican Presidents since Ike, he will underperform every Democrat in the post –WW2 era when it comes to the annualized increase in real growth less increase in debt per capita.  He’ll probably underperform even if debt is left out.  He’ll probably even underpeform if you leave out the “per capita” and fail to adjust for inflation.</p>
<p>So now the question… what happens after that?  What will be the position of all those who are crowing these days about how tax cuts work, and pointing to GW’s adequate three years as evidence?  (These people all ignore the fact that GW’s tax cutting started in his first year in office.  In 2001, he cut the lowest marginal rate from 15% to 10%, and the top rate was also cut by half a percentage point.  The top rate was cut by another half a percentage point in 2002.)  </p>
<p>I see a few options.  They could insist his performance was just dandy, facts be damned – call that the St. Ronald the Reagan scenario.  That basically involves pretending that one’s mostest favoritest wonderfulest president just managed to beat out the performance of history’s greatest monster, and that only by driving up the debt.  </p>
<p>Another option is to insist that it’s Clinton’s fault.  A third option is to insist that somehow one of the other actions that GW took somehow nullified the magical properties of the tax cuts.  (I.e., “he spends like a democrat!”)  A fourth option is to admit they’re wrong, they’ve been wrong, and they’ve led the country down a ruinous path.  </p>
<p>I could be wrong… who knows, GW might produce the bestest most Reaganish economy ever in the next two years.  Time will tell.  But what if I’m right?  What option are the believers going to take?  (Its pretty option they aren’t going to take.)</p>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDdiOTg5NDk3OWQ2NzE5YTUzYTMxZjEyZTBjYzJmZTc=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> dons his clown suit as he pens an attack on certain GOP candidates for the White House – calling them hedgehogs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another impressive jobs report was released by the U.S. Department of Labor last Friday, but you didn’t hear anything about it from the big-three Republican candidates for president. They claim to support President Bush’s supply-side tax cuts, and say they will fight repeal should they be elected to the Oval Office. Yet neither Sen. McCain, nor former-Gov. Romney, nor former-Mayor Giuliani talks about the continued economic benefits of the sweeping tax cuts of 2003 &#8230; Just look at the evidence. Wall Street economist Michael Darda points out that real wages from increased job creation have climbed at twice the speed during this business cycle than in the first 66 months of the previous cycle. Boosted by service-sector job creation, nonfarm payrolls grew by 97,000 in February, with a net upward revision of 55,000 for the December and January reports. The median length, or duration, of unemployment fell 8 percentage points in the last year, while non-management wages increased 4.1 percent, almost twice the inflation rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s definitely look at the evidence – starting with last month’s news on employment.  An increase of only 97,000 is weak employment growth.  But why is Kudlow presenting the payroll survey when he has argued that the household survey is the better measure?  Could it be that employment per the household survey fell?  Yes – the unemployment rate fell but that’s because the labor force participation rate fell.  And don’t you love the fact that Kudlow is talking increases in the nominal value of “non-management wages”?  In real terms, wages are only 0.5% higher than they were in July 2003.  This is not the massive increase in real wages that Michael Darda and the man in the clown suit want to portray.</p>
<p>Conservative economist <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/03/more-laffer-curve-laughers.html">Andrew Samwick</a> must pay more attention to what Kudlow’s colleague &#8211; Ramesh Ponnuru – has been doing than Kudlow as Senator McCain has bought into the free lunch supply-side nonsense that Kudlow is peddling.  Andrew passes along a couple of questions from conservative economist <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/03/mccain-on-laffer-curve.html">Greg Mankiw</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. If you think the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts increased revenue, why did you vote against them?</p>
<p>2. If you think tax cuts increase revenue, why advocate spending restraint? Can&#8217;t we pay for new spending programs with more tax cuts?</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrew has a few questions of his own:</p>
<blockquote><p>As Greg has announced that he&#8217;s an economic advisor to Governor Romney, I&#8217;ll be very curious to hear Romney&#8217;s response to a direct question about the circumstances under which he would be willing to increase taxes if he&#8217;s elected President.  The question that I would like to have answered by any policy maker who voted for the tax cuts and believes that they have increased revenues is: Why did you make them so small?</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I’ve always been leery of the legal system.  I’ll have a post at some point about my one and only dealing with the legal system at a later date, but suffice to say, that one dealing is the reason I try to avoid having to deal with the system.  The Ex-Girlfriend is less cynical, or perhaps was.  This post is about her recent experience, followed by a few questions.</p>
<p>Here’s our side of the story.  The Ex-GF was negotiating with another individual.  The other individual was to provide some business services and had come highly recommended.  After an initial contact, the other party sent the Ex-GF a proposal.  The Ex-GF requested numerous and significant changes, but anticipating successful conclusions to the negotiations (see the earlier comment on lack of cynicism), made a good will payment equal to $1,000.  Long story short…  13 weeks later, there was still no further proposal.  The Ex-GF made many and repeated attempts to call the other party.  Finally, the Ex-GF finally got through, and told the other party the deal was off.  The other party refused to return the $1,000.  The Ex-GF took her to small claims court.</p>
<p>Two things came up:<br />1.  The guy running the court was clearly not a judge.  He repeatedly referred to the proposal as a contract.  <br />2.  The other party indicated that the Ex-GF made no attempt to contact it.  The Ex-GF did not have her phone records (cellphone and landline) with her, which was a mistake.  </p>
<p>As to item 1, I was under the impression that, a contract requires both an offer and an acceptance.  It seems to make no sense to have someone making decisions, even in Small Claims Court, who is unclear on this.  But on the other hand, if it is I that am unclear on this, I should note that I have in front of me a contract that says Bill Gates owes me $10 billion.  I have another one that notes that the money Warren Buffett intends to give to charity actually belongs to me.  Sure, those bastards refused to sign the contract, but a contract is a contract.</p>
<p>As to item 2… an attorney friend of the Ex-GF (actually, a former boyfriend of hers – does that make him the Ex-GF’s Ex-BF?) says everyone lies in Small Claims Court and nobody cares.  Is that true?  If the Ex-GF were to send photocopies of her phone bills (for three months) to Small Claims Court, would the other party be prosecuted?  If not, why not?  After all, if there is no penalty for perjury, the system cannot work at all.  I understand that the system is not intended to provide justice, but rather to enforce the law, but if its not making any attempt to do either, what use is it?</p>

                                <p>If there wasn’t enough evidence that Zell Miller has gone completely insane, we now have his <a href="http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/shared-blogs/ajc/politicalinsider/entries/2007/03/09/says_zell_military_shortages_s.html">solution to everything</a> is to have more babies grow up in poverty:<br />
<blockquote>It hasn’t gotten widespread play yet, but former U.S. Sen. Zell Miller made a little news this week in Macon when he declared that abortion has contributed to the military’s manpower shortage, the Social Security crisis, and the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States.  “How could this great land of plenty produce too few people in the last 30 years? Here is the brutal truth that no one dares to mention: We’re too few because too many of our babies have been killed,” Miller said.  “Over 45 million since Roe v. Wade in 1973. If those 45 million children had lived, today they would be defending our country, they would be filling our jobs, they would be paying into Social Security,” the former Georgia governor said. “Still, we watch as 3,700 babies are killed every single day in America. It is unbelievable that a nation under God would allow this.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Zell does seem to call for a theocracy here as in “it is unbelievable that a nation under God would allow this”.  After all – we need the government to dictate such choices to woman according to give him hell Zell.  It would seem some of the comments to those who read this post from the Atlanta Journal and Constitution are concerned that kids that grow up in poverty aren’t the solution to a Social Security shortfall but may be adding to it.  It’s good to know not everyone in Georgia is insane as their former Senator – even though <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MTdjNGUzNmQwN2Q4ZjIxZmQ1NTdmMDliYjIwNjU4MWU=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> is.</p>
