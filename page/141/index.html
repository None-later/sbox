                                <p>by <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a></p>
<p><strong>Temporary Employment: A New Ugly Rearing its Head in Europe?</strong></p>
<p>Last week <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-01/why-europe-really-must-pursue-structural-reform-clive-crook.html">Clive Crook opined</a> on some fallacies of labor reform, specifically related to the unions and through the Spanish experience. Labor reform is a highly contentious subject, given its close ties to welfare and politics. Based on Clive Crook’s article, I delved into global temporary employment using OECD data and noticed two things: (1) not only is it too ‘simple-minded’ to attribute labor problems to one or two broad agents (unions, in the case of Europe), but it’s impossible to compare one country’s problem to another; and (2) other global economies – Ireland being the most worrisome candidate – saw respective shares of temporary employment surge in recent years. To me, this highlights the fact that known labor issues are just the beginning – new problems are surfacing that will require attention in the future.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-01/why-europe-really-must-pursue-structural-reform-clive-crook.html">Clive Crook</a> via <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1972155">Bentolila, Dolado, and Jimeno</a> (or the <a href="http://voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/7537">Vox version</a>), the cyclical aspect of Spain’s two-tier labor market – the two tier system consists of a large share of temporary workers ‘outside’ the permanent employment positions – can explain in part the boom in employment during the bubble and its crash during the recession. But that doesn’t explain the experience of the US. In 2005 (the last measured <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/conemp.pdf">date for the US</a>), temporary workers accounted for just over 4% of employment compared to 33% in Spain; however, like that in Spain, the US unemployment doubled during the crisis. What’s one country’s problem is not necessarily another country’s structural issue.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In contrast to other key players in Europe, the Spanish rate of temporary employment fell 8.4 ppt since 2005, where most of the drop occurred in 2009 and 2010. The crisis eradicated some of the inefficiencies of Spanish temporary employment by consolidating those industries that tended to favor temporary employment during the bubble, construction for one. More worrisome, though, is the trend in temporary employment in other European markets. The rate of temporary employment increased 3.5 ppt, 3 ppt, and 5.7 ppt in Portugal, the Netherlands, and Ireland, respectively, spanning 2005-2010.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/oecd_temp_work.jpg"><img alt="" height="450" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/oecd_temp_work.jpg" width="600"></a></p>
<p>The problem with Spain’s two-tier labor market is well known, while that in Ireland and Portugal, for example, is emerging. <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/8/17652675.pdf">The 2002 OECD Employment Outlook Chapter 3</a> outlines some adverse impacts of temporary employment. Temporary employment is associated with higher wage gaps among the temporary and permanent employees, fewer health benefits, negative effects on well-being for individuals and families, and minimal job security. I haven’t read recent research to this point; however, those countries with outsized surges in temporary employment – Ireland, Portugal, Netherlands, Italy, Greece, and the UK are among the highest in the sample above – are likely to experience a drop in welfare relative to other countries, all else equal.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of the Spanish labor market on a relative basis is that while Spain has a large presence of temporary workers, these workers do have a relative advantage relating to <em>claim of unfair dismissal</em> than do other global workers. The implication could be, that as the share of temporary workers rise in Ireland, Portugal, or the Netherlands, for example, the employment becomes more volatile and reduces expected lifetime income, hence spending or growth. (Data from <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/11/0,3746,en_2649_37457_42695243_1_1_1_37457,00.html">the OECD</a>.)</p>

<p>I’m worried and just conjecturing here. But, not only have countries not reformed labor issues already in the pipeline – the Spanish two-tier labor issues date back to 1984 – we’re creating new ones. The Great Recession and forced austerity is likely a very big factor in the surge in Irish temporary <strike>unemployment </strike>employment. This will bring with it unintended consequences that may require further reform (or alternative scenarios like exit from the EMU) at some point in the future</p>

<blockquote><p>James had gathered a mix of friends, acquaintances, and random strangers at his Rent Party, but no one was talking to anyone else. So he decided to get people to talk to each other, using the easiest non-visible variable available:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Don, what’s your IQ?&#8221;<br />&#8220;171.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Sharon, what’s your IQ&#8221;<br />&#8220;169.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Maybe you should take with Don&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>James watched as Sharon and Don began a discussion of elementary particle theory, astrophysics, and <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/5cfe15e0-4cca-11e1-8741-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1ldSzrjJa" target="_blank">Ken Rogoff’s chess games</a>.</p>
<p>Encouraged, James continued his efforts.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Lynn, what’s your IQ?&#8221; &#8220;151&#8221;<br />&#8220;Jorge, what’s your IQ?&#8221;<br />&#8220;149.&#8221;<br />&#8220;You should talk with Lynn.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And they were soon discussing the biophysics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriorhodopsin" target="_blank">bacteriorhodopsin</a> and <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HilbertSpace.html" target="_blank">Hilbert Space</a>.</p>
<p>Thrilled this was working so well, James tried again.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Steve, what’s your IQ?&#8221; <br />&#8220;51.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Lucy, what’s your IQ?&#8221; &#8220;49.&#8221;<br />&#8220;You two should probably talk,&#8221; James said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lucy turned to Steve, &#8220;So where do you teach <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/anti-keynesian-revisionism/">Real Business Cycle Theory</a>?&#8221; (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/02/old-versus-new-keynesian-models.html">Mark Thoma</a>)</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>David Frum was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/25/david-frum-aei-split-cons_n_513544.html=MchpliJtWACJjHMXDklC0A">excommunicated</a> from the Righties Club a few years back because he insisted on occasionally <a href="http://www.frumforum.com/waterloo">saying sane and accurate things</a>.
<p>He continues that aberrational behavior today in his <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/06/charles-murray-book-review.html">review</a> of AEI uber-zealot Charles Murray’s new book, <em>Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010</em> (which I will <em>not</em> link to here — no Google love from me).</p>
<p>Frum’s takedown is so good that I won’t try to recap it. I’ll just comment on one quote that he provides from Murray (paragraph break and emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote><p>Recall figure 2.1 at the beginning of the book, showing <strong>stagnant incomes</strong> for people below the 50th income percentile.** High-paying <strong>unionized jobs have become scarce</strong> and <strong>real wages for all kinds of blue-collar jobs have been stagnant or falling</strong> since the 1970s.</p>
<p>But <strong>these trends don’t explain why [working-class white] men in the 2000s worked fewer jobs, found it harder to get jobs than other Americans did, and more often dropped out of the labor market</strong> than they had in the 1960s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It <em>doesn’t</em>?  Doesn’t “textbook economics” — not to mention common sense — tell us that if you pay people less, they’ll have less incentive to work?</p>
<p>But Murray knows better — they’ve got <em>plenty </em>of incentive:</p>
<blockquote><p>Insofar as men need to work to survive – an important proviso – falling hourly income does not discourage work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As long people are reduced to the level of  survival — so people have to take any available job, no matter how shitty or badly compensated, or <em>die </em>(along with their families and children) — it’s no problem getting them to work.</p>
<p>That takes a big load off my mind.</p>

<p><strong>Which Economy Is Pursuing Procyclical Fiscal Policy?</strong></p>
<p>Today the <a href="http://bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">BLS reported </a>that the US unemployment rate dropped to 8.3% in January 2012. This is the lowest measured rate since February 2009 – a local trough. Also this week, <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-31012012-AP/EN/3-31012012-AP-EN.PDF">Eurostat reported </a>that the Euro area (EA) unemployment rate stabilized in December at 10.4%. This is the highest level since inception of the euro – a global peak (so far).</p>
<p>It’s pretty easy to see through relative labor performance which economy is pursuing procyclical fiscal policy, namely deficits rise when the economy is booming and fall when the economy is contracting: the EA.</p>

Sullivan</a> (Tax Analysts), <a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/files/tn-1.pdf">New Research Weakens Case for Small Business Tax Relief</a><br />The National Federation of Independent Business states on its <a href="http://www.nfib.com/">website</a>: &#8220;Small business has created about two of every three net new jobs in the United States since at least the early 1970s.&#8221; And on its <a href="http://web.sba.gov/faqs/faqIndexAll.cfm?areaid=24">website</a>, the Small Business Administration claims, &#8220;Small firms accounted for 65 percent (or 9.8 million) of the 15 million net new jobs created between 1993 and 2009.&#8221; These claims are endlessly repeated on television and in print. And both political parties are perfectly happy to leave them unchallenged. But two new strands of academic research are quietly shredding the idea that policies to support small businesses hold the key to job creation.

<p>Why we don&#8217;t need corporate tax &#8220;overhaul&#8221;</p>
<p>GOP poormouthing on behalf of rich corporate allies(Part I in a series) These days, one hears a great deal from politicians on the right about how a corporate tax &#8220;overhaul&#8221; is needed because our taxes are &#8220;too complex&#8221; and/or &#8220;too anti-competitive&#8221; or because our tax rates are &#8220;too high&#8221;. The same GOP politicians who whine and whimper about how huge the deficit is, and accuse President Obama of driving our country to ruin with the deficit are willing to lower the tax burden paid by highly profitable corporations considerably (thus increasing the deficit and adding to regressivity of the tax system)&#8211;so long as they are appeasing their multinational constituency, the huge corporations who are the new providers of campaign funds and the new decisionmakers in elections&#8211;even though the corporate entities have no vote. Claims of revenue neutrality are generally little more than PR cover for corporate giveaways.</p>
<p>Just a couple of examples from a recent Bloomberg piece:
<ul>
<li>Republican Senator Robert Portman says he will unveil a new proposal soon that will cut taxes for multinational companies&#8217; repatriated offshore profits&#8211;i.e., a permanent tax holiday for multinationalsm as a first step towards a very MNE favorable move to a territorial tax system&#8211;that will remedy &#8220;an inefficient and complex maze of tax preferences&#8221;. See, e.g., Kathleen Hunter, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-02/portman-corporate-tax-plan-to-include-low-repatriation-rate.html">Portman Corporate Tax Plan to Include Low Repatriation Rate</a>, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 1, 2012). Portman claims this huge tax cut for the high and mighty MNEs (and their managers/owners) is needed because they &#8220;pay[] a very steep tax bill if and when they choose to bring their money home.&#8221; Ludicrous. There is a very generous foreign tax credit provision that allows many MNEs to reduce their taxes to near zero anyway. Further, the deferral they are allowed on active business income gives them the time value of money benefit. Most of what foreign corporations want to do is allow their taxes on non-US income to reduce their taxes on US income&#8211;which is a kind of subsidy for offshoring that costs US jobs. And of course, as I&#8217;ve noted in earlier posts on tax holidays and proposals for a territorial system to replace a worldwide system, corporations hold more money overseas when they think there is a good chance that their buddies (or &#8220;bought pols&#8221;?) will give them the tax break they have been lobbying for&#8211;so these proposals encourage corporations to engage in the activity that these proposals say they are addressing, thus giving them more ammunition to get the change they want. Portman, of course, says he wants to &#8220;streamline&#8221; the corporate tax and lower the rate to 25%. We have a statutory rate of 35% now and most corporations that pay taxes (which are not by any means all of the corporations that make significant profits) pay less than 25%. If we lower the statutory rate to 25%, it is quite likely that most corporations that actually end up paying taxes will be a smaller number than with the 35% rate and at a much lower rate&#8211;probably around 10-15% instead of 20-25%. Of course, what the result will be&#8211;as it was in the 1986 tax reform that lowered rates for ordinary income and ended a number of problematic tax preferences such as the capital gains preferential rate&#8211;is that the lower rates will stay, and all of the loopy tax preferences (and more) will be reenacted within a couple of years under heavy lobbying for the same by the corporations that benefit from this round. </li>
<li>Dave Camp, Michigan Republicans and Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, wants to exempt 95% of overseas profits. </li>
</ul>
<p>Is there merit in this drumbeat of (lobbyist-induced) calls for &#8220;corporate tax overhaul legislation&#8221;? The simple answer is no.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><strong>On Complexity:</strong></p>
<p>Most complexity in the code is there for one of two reasons.</p>
<p>The most likely reason for complexity is the creation of tax preferences heavily lobbied for by corporate lobbyists. One example is the so-called &#8220;domestic production activity deduction&#8221; that lowers the tax rate by 9% for most industries (even ones that don&#8217;t really produce anything) and 6% for natural resource extractive industries. There are tax breaks on top of tax breaks for the resource industries, of course, that get numerous special benefits throughout the Code, while joining in various coalitions that lobby AGAINST even extraordinarily modest support for green industries (such as reasonably low cost loans for solar power).</p>
<p>The second main source of complexity is the clear need for specific anti-abuse provisions to undo the harm done when corporations use what can most charitably be called aggressive and inventive interpretations of Code provisions&#8211;often ones that are hyper-literal in nature (the kind of analysis that allowed the Bush Treasury to redefine what &#8220;exchange&#8221; means in the reorganization provisions in order to allow taxpayers to manipulate the allocation of consideration to create a hitherto unrecognizable tax loss in the reorg transaction) or turn the Code&#8217;s clear textual provision on its head (look at the briefs for the defendant&#8211;or for that matter the lousy statutory interpretation in the district court opinions&#8211; in the Black &#038; Decker contingent liability shelter case, where Black &#038; Decker argued for application of a provision in section 357(c) (which says explicitly that it applies only where paragraph one of that provision applies) in a context where paragraph one did not apply). </p>
<p>As a result of the contingent liability shelters, Congress added various Code provisions, including section 358(h) (having to do with the basis for corporate assets in transactions with significant liabilities) and section 357(d) (having to do with calculating the amount of liability assumed).<br />Complexity, in other words, is not an evil in itself. Sophisticated taxpayers aren&#8217;t harmed by complexity, and in fact complexity is needed to provide sufficient detail to prevent sophisticated taxpayers (with the help of their tax advisers) from cheating. There is generally less complexity in provisions that are relevant for unsophisticated taxpayers, though it is more clearly an obstacle to good tax compliance behavior there.</p>
<p><strong>On Competitiveness</strong>:</p>
<p>Competitiveness is used so frequently that it seems doubtful that anybody really knows what they mean by it. If one company destroys a union and is able to pay their workers lower wages as a result, then a company that produces a similar product will claim that &#8220;competitiveness&#8221; requires that they be allowed to do the same. Of course, another approach would be for the company that retains an active union, and continues to provide pension and health care benefits could lobby Congress to enact stronger laws protecting worker rights to pension and health care benefits. In other words, competitiveness is consistently used as an argunent, when it comes to corporations, for taking away benefits to workers, communities, states and the nation for the benefit of the corporations. </p>
<p>Competitiveness could just as easily be used to argue for maintaining programs, procedures and benefits for workers, communities, states and the nation by considering what would be necessary to buttress the system that supports those benefit levels. And in fact that view of competition&#8211;that we are competing globally to create both profitable companies AND a secure and well-paid workforce that can support a healthy economy that can in turn support a quality of life in all dimensions&#8211;would lead to different decisions not only about taxation but also about anti-trust, excise taxes, trade treaties, environmental protection, and many regulatory projects.</p>
<p>Furthermore, competitiveness is often used as an argument in the abstract when the main competitors are both US based companies. There, the argument for reducing taxes to enhance competitiveness is at its weakest, but few competitiveness arguments reveal just how the competititon is playing out even on a globalized playing field.</p>
<p><strong>On Rate Structures</strong>:</p>
<p>The 1986 tax reform act is a frequent reference these days when people talk about amending the Code generally and specifically about amending the corporate tax provisions. But the context for that act&#8217;s passage was quite different. Individuals were taxed at rates that were reasonably progressive&#8211;with a top rate at 70% (though the brackets could probably have been better defined to differentiate among top income recipients). Further, the 1954 Code had built up a plethora of tax preferences (especially useful to the rich) and the Congress had realized that the preferential capital gains rate was wreaking havoc on sensible provisions because of the arbitrage opportunities it created. Thus, there was room for &#8220;base broadening&#8221; (removing ill-advised preferences spread throughout the 1954 Code) as a means of paying for &#8220;rate lowering&#8221; (lowering the fairly high rates about half, without costing the fisc because of the higher amount of income on which those rates would be charged).</p>
<p>We are not in the same situation today. We have very high deficits because of an economic crisis caused by two interwoven problems&#8211;(i) the lax regulatory oversight of 40 years of Reaganism, which permitted the financialization of the economy and led to excessive incomes for people at the top (managers and owners, hedge fund and equity fund managers, and speculators generally) and excessive debt for banks and especially people not at the top (because of their stagnant or reduced incomes in the face of growing costs, caused in part by the relaxation of regulations and anti-trust activity coupled with the anti-union attitudees and activity); and (ii) the success of a radical right-wing fringe in characterizing government and business as having adverse interests and progressive programs supporting social well being (from Social Security to Medicare to Medicaid to (modest) heatlh care reforms intended to reign in the cost of medical care to unemployment benefits to efforts to reign in contracts of adhesion in the consumer credit markets) as &#8220;unmerited&#8221; &#8220;entitlements or costly and anti-competitive regulation of businesses that counters the &#8220;free market&#8221; that will ensure &#8220;growth and jobs&#8221;. </p>
<p>The result of the rhetoric is a citizenry that is ignorant of the actual income distribution, tax burdens, and impact of government spending on jobs and the health of the economy. The result of the 40-year &#8220;reaganomics&#8221; effort from the right to cut regulations, cut taxes, privatize and militarize is that this is no context for rate reduction but in fact a context in which those who can afford to do so&#8211;for sure those individuals and households in the top two quintiles of the income distribution that comprise the upper middle class and the upper class and all profit-making corporations&#8211;should be paying taxes at HIGHER rates, not lower rates.</p>
<p>It should be noted that President Obama&#8211;who is at best a middle of the roader on tax issues&#8211;also is said to plan to propose an &#8220;overhaul of the U.S. corporate tax system&#8221; in connection with his budget plan for FY 2013 that involves lowering rates and base broadening. See Steven Sloan, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-02/obama-said-to-propose-corporate-tax-overhaul-next-month.html">Obama said to propose corporate tax overhaul next month</a>, Businessweek.com (Feb. 2, 2012). Again&#8211;lowering the rate is a bad idea. Lowering the rate without base broadening is a stupid idea. But the kind of base broadening that is included, if such a proposal eventually passes, matters an awful lot. The problem is that if Obama proposes such a reform, the GOP won&#8217;t support it unless the &#8220;base broadening&#8221; is essentially inconsequential and can be undone easily later or affects only little guys and not the big-monied lobbyists. Thus this looks like another of those initiatives from the White House that play into the right&#8217;s agenda and do little to advance any progressive idea.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.javelinstrategy.com/blog/author/james-van-dyke/">James Van Dyke</a> points to some numbers on the move to transfer funds out of big banks:<br />
<blockquote>Bank Transfer Day and the Occupy Movement have received tremendous attention, and for the first time we have market research data to measure the impact on the financial services industry. Javelin’s research estimates that 5.6 million U.S. adults with a banking relationship changed providers in the past 90 days. Of those switchers, 610,000 US adults (or 11% of the 5.6 million) cited Bank Transfer Day as their reason and actually moved their accounts from a large to a small institution. With a Google search of “bank transfer day” returning fully 22,000,000 responses we’re not surprised that these angry bank-switchers represent nearly a three-time increase over the amount of people who took their funds out of large banks for highly-similar reasons during the previous 90-day period in 2011.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>In defending the U.S. military’s medical system in court, the <a href="http://www.allgov.com/Agency/Department_of_Justice">U.S. Department of Justice</a> is arguing that service personnel and their families are not allowed to sue for medical malpractice regardless of the circumstance.<br />As a general rule, military members are barred from taking the government to court, which has been established in several court cases, in particular the 1950 Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/340/135/case.html">Feres v. United States</a>. But now government lawyers are trying to expand the scope of Feres to make it impossible for families of soldiers to sue for medical malpractice, if at the time of the bad care the service member was on active duty.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by <strong>Beverly Mann</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.truth-out.org/corporations-are-not-people/1328107954" target="_blank">Thomas Hartmann</a> writes via Truthout:<br />
<blockquote>Most Americans don&#8217;t realize that the idea that ‘corporations are people’ and ‘money is speech’ are concepts that were never, ever considered or promoted or even passed by any legislature in the history of America. Neither were they ever promoted or signed into law by any president &#8211; if anything, the opposite, with presidents from Grover Cleveland in 1887 to Barack Obama in 2010 condemning them.<br /><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />And Congress and the executive branch are the two of the three branches of government that are elected by the people, and thus the only two to which the founders of this country and the framers of the Constitution gave the right to create laws.<br /><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />The Supreme Court is so much not supposed to create law, that Article 3, Section 2 of the Constitution even says that it must operate ‘under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are two problems with what Hartmann writes. First of all, there needs to be an explicit distinction made between the idea of “corporate personhood” in law, generally, and “corporate personhood” in a constitutional-rights sense. Hartmann, like so many others who are appropriately outraged by <i>Citizens United</i> and earlier corporate-free-speech Supreme Court opinions, clearly intends his comments to apply only to the corporate-free-speech Supreme-Court-created laws, just as the drafters of the proposed constitutional amendment regarding corporate personhood do.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />But the “corporate personhood” fiction actually was created, I believe, simply as a practical way to allow corporations to own property. Later, that fiction enabled corporations to sue and be sued, to be subject to criminal laws and civil regulatory law and to be charged with violations of those laws and to be fined for violations and required by court order to comply with (say) a particular environmental or securities regulation or whatever. State statutes, which provide for the creation of corporations, and federal statutes do provide for these things, and although they don’t use the term “corporate person,” these laws (e.g., tax laws, environmental laws, lawsuit procedural laws) do include corporations in the statute’s “definitions” section, in defining the term “person”, in order to make clear that the statute or regulation does apply to corporations.</p>
<p>So the problem of corporate personhood is that the Supreme Court has pronounced corporations “persons” for purposes of First Amendment speech rights. Constitutional rights apply only to persons, so this pronouncement of personhood for corporations in a constitutional sense, rather than just a statutory sense (as in, say, corporations can own property), was a prerequisite to the accordance of First Amendment free-speech rights to corporations. This is a really important distinction. </p>
<p>The distinction gets complicated when you consider that there <i>are</i> some constitutional rights that most people would think do and should pertain to corporations: the Fourth Amendment’s guarantee against warrantless searches and seizures, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments’ due and property “takings” provisions, for example. But that’s because actual people do own direct monetary shares of corporations, and so corporate property does belong to real people, and because the constitutional protections at issue there—against warrantless searches and seizures of documents, for example—would compromise those rights of real persons (the corporation’s employees or customers, for example). </p>
<p>The First Amendment right to advocate for a particular political candidate or party or political position, using shareholders’ money, though, is hardly a right that logically can be said to derive from those shareholders’ First Amendment speech rights, the exercise of which is cannot reasonably be said to be intentionally collective; the specific expenditure is not foreseeable to shareholders, many of whom would be horrified by it. Of course, the Fab Five majority in <i>Citizens United</i> did pretend otherwise. But then, declaring clearly false facts in order to arrive at their result in that case is the very hallmark of that opinion.</p>
<p>But here’s another problem with what Hartmann and others are arguing: This claim of theirs that the courts have no authority to declare render decisions—rules of law—concerning issues of constitutional law is profoundly dangerous. It mirrors what Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia regularly claim, except of course when they themselves are simply fabricating some new rule of constitutional law.</p>
<p>I love Thom Hartmann. But I think his position here needs some refinement.</p>
