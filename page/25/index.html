<p>This was another tepid employment report not much different than the reports in 2012.</p>
<p>Payroll employment rose 168,000 and the household survey showed a gain of only 17,000</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DSBXCAO2YF8/UQvTCqoJngI/AAAAAAAACbE/bMPUYXBfvgc/s1600/Clipboard01+MONTHLY.bmp"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DSBXCAO2YF8/UQvTCqoJngI/AAAAAAAACbE/bMPUYXBfvgc/s320/Clipboard01+MONTHLY.bmp" height="217" width="320"> </a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DSBXCAO2YF8/UQvTCqoJngI/AAAAAAAACbE/bMPUYXBfvgc/s1600/Clipboard01+MONTHLY.bmp"></a></p>
<p>Private payrolls expanded 168,000 while government employment fell 9,000.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-40s81B6vOwo/UQvS5VHZP_I/AAAAAAAACa8/2akYC1y_zBQ/s1600/Clipboard01+payroll.bmp"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-40s81B6vOwo/UQvS5VHZP_I/AAAAAAAACa8/2akYC1y_zBQ/s320/Clipboard01+payroll.bmp" height="217" width="320"></a></p>
<p> Perhaps more importantly the year over year change in employment is showing significant signs of weakness,  Both the household survey and payroll data show that the year over year gain in employment has peaked.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dZjXh8Wf7WM/UQvSzjuKHqI/AAAAAAAACa0/k3QzF600E3o/s1600/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dZjXh8Wf7WM/UQvSzjuKHqI/AAAAAAAACa0/k3QzF600E3o/s320/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp" height="217" width="320"></a><br /> Moreover, this weakness is appearing despite the fact that the annual benchmark revisions showed stronger employment growth in 2012 than originally reported.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d3-dn_sk3ck/UQvStZKTr7I/AAAAAAAACas/h2pE2rCOsQA/s1600/Clipboard01+TABLE+A.bmp"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d3-dn_sk3ck/UQvStZKTr7I/AAAAAAAACas/h2pE2rCOsQA/s320/Clipboard01+TABLE+A.bmp" height="180" width="320"></a></p>
<p> The revisions also significantly changed the pattern of hours worked in 2012.  Originally, hours worked fell well below trend in mid-2012 and were strengthening back to trend at year-end.  Now<br />it appears that hours worked were not as weak as originally reported. But with the average workweek unchanged in January, the January hours worked fell 0.2%.</p>
<p> <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mwPpDxF7LT4/UQvTSmR9ntI/AAAAAAAACbM/ie-PDnXiSoo/s1600/Clipboard01+hours.bmp"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mwPpDxF7LT4/UQvTSmR9ntI/AAAAAAAACbM/ie-PDnXiSoo/s320/Clipboard01+hours.bmp" height="232" width="320"></a></p>
<p> On the other hand the apparent bottoming of average hourly earnings growth  is still intact and was actually strengthening in January.  </p>
<p> <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LhcXFWYReLs/UQvTXhEBnwI/AAAAAAAACbU/6Q-eiSCJf3Y/s1600/Clipboard01+xahe.bmp"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LhcXFWYReLs/UQvTXhEBnwI/AAAAAAAACbU/6Q-eiSCJf3Y/s320/Clipboard01+xahe.bmp" height="217" width="320"></a><br /> The growth in average weekly earnings fell back to only 1.2%  versus 1.7% in December and the low of 1.0% in October.  It is going to be very hard for consumer to absorb the increase in payroll and income taxes in early 2013.  Prospects for consumer spending in early 2013 do not appear promising.</p>

                                <p>I watched NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams last night.  Big Mistake. </p>
<p>Big mistake. </p>
<p>Because now I’m really confused.  I was pretty darn sure until then that “raising the debt ceiling” meant allowing the Treasury Department to pay financial obligations already incurred, such as interest on bonds, Medicare payments, and contract obligations, and to allow continued payments for ongoing financial obligations such as Social Security payments, Veterans’ benefits, and salary payments to federal employees, some of whose jobs are sort of important.  (Think: air traffic controllers.)  I had thought that because I had followed the recurring-crisis news reports about it since 2011, when the first of the crises began.  And because Obama had actually explained it in his Jan. 14 press conference. </p>
<p>But now, well, I think I might have misunderstood, because after Williams reported that the Senate yesterday had approved the House bill to “suspend” the debt ceiling through May 19, he added, shaking his head in disapproval, something like: “This is Washington’s version of kicking the can down the road.  Our debt is now more than a trillion dollars.”</p>
<p>I suggest that next time Williams is onboard one of NBC’s corporate jets, he might read, say, Paul Krugman’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/opinion/krugman-looking-for-mister-goodpain.html?_r=0">column in today’s New York Times</a>.  It doesn’t explain the difference between the debt ceiling statute and budget-appropriations statutes, so Williams will continue to conflate the two until he digs deeper and reads earlier Krugman columns or other mainstream-media articles that did that.  But it does (yet again)&#8211;<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/paul-ryan-says-taxes-should-be-raised.html">to borrow a phrase from Paul Ryan</a> in his Meet the Press interview aired last Sunday&#8211;debate the efficacy of Keynesian economics, and whether anti-Keynesian “austerity” measures reduce or instead increase national debt in real terms and, more important (although Williams apparently doesn’t know this), decrease or instead increase debt relative to GDP.</p>
<p>But if he is going to wait until he’s up there in the air in that Learjet to read the Krugman column, I hope the trip occurs before May 20.  </p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>UPDATE: Additional recommended reading for Brian Williams: Joe Scarborough, Paul Krugman and the economist-pundit divide on debt and deficits, Neil Irwin, Washington Post, yesterday. </p>
<p>Scarborough, though, at least knows what the debt ceiling law is, and that it isn’t the same as budget-appropriations legislation.  He does, after all, work for MSNBC, not, say, NBC News. </p>

                                <p>This is more or less relevant to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/john-boehner-says-defense-spending-is.html">Beverly&#8217;s post from earlier today</a>.</p>
<div>How many times have you heard Boehner, McConnell, Ryan or one of the legion of right-wing talking heads say, &#8220;<i>We don&#8217;t have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem</i>?&#8221;  I refuted that lie repeatedly in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/yes-right-wing-lies-when-they-say-obama.html">this AB post</a> and at the included links.   But this is one of those zombie ideas that simply will not stay in the grave.  </div>
<p>Therefore,  some prominent voices have found it necessary to sing out again against  the lie. I will add my humble quavery baritone to the chorus.</p>
<p>Here in Graph 1 is <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/01/government-spending-down-obama-era">Kevin Drum demonstrating</a> how Real Government Expenditures per Capita have changed under the last three presidents.<br />
<blockquote>What  we have isn&#8217;t a spending problem. That&#8217;s under control. What we have is  a problem with Republicans not wanting to pay the bills they themselves  were largely responsible for running up.</p></blockquote>
<p>

<div> Graph 1, Real Government Expenditures per Capita</div>
<p>By  using real [inflation adjusted] and per capita numbers, Drum has  introduced a couple of denominators.  Real expenses per cap is a  rational way to display the data, but not the only way. So lest someone  cry out about that ol&#8217; devil denominator, let&#8217;s have a different look.</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/martin-wolf-hippie/">Paul Krugman </a>we  get Graph 2 and Graph 3, from FRED, showing total Government  expenditures and Federal Government expenditures, respectively, on log  scales.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/01/23/opinion/012313krugman1/012313krugman1-blog480.png"><img border="0" height="315" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/01/23/opinion/012313krugman1/012313krugman1-blog480.png" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 2. Government Total Expenditures</div>
<div><a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/01/23/opinion/012313krugman2/012313krugman2-blog480.png"><img border="0" height="315" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/01/23/opinion/012313krugman2/012313krugman2-blog480.png" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 3, Federal Government Total Expenditures</div>
<p>
<blockquote>Yes, you can argue that spending was growing too fast under Bush,  although it’s funny how few deficit scolds saw fit to mention that at  the time. Or you can say that you just want less spending, although as  always people who say this tend to be short on specifics. But the  narrative that says that spending has surged under Obama is just wrong –  what we’ve actually seen is a slowdown at exactly the time when, for  macroeconomic reasons, we should have been spending more.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember,  a log scale represents constant growth as a straight line, and zero  growth as a horizontal line.  So, in pure dollar numbers, spending  hasn&#8217;t quite declined, but it has stagnated to almost zero growth.   Hence Drum&#8217;s decline in inflation adjusted, per capita terms.</p>
<p>In  Graph 4, we get one more longer range look, using Krugman&#8217;s data  series, this time on a linear scale.  Also presented is the difference  between the two, which is the amount of spending by state and local  governments.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=eRU"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=eRU" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 4, Government Spending at Different Levels</div>
<p> The  red line is total spending at all levels of governemnt, the blue line  is federal only, and the green line is the difference, state and local  spending.  Note that the green line flattens early in the recession</p>
<p>To  bring things full circle, Graph 5 shows Federal Government current  receipts.  Look at this and tell me we don&#8217;t have a revenue problem.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=eS4"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=eS4" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 5, Federal Government Current Receipts</div>
<p>To  drive this point home, Graph 6 shows Federal Receipts as a fraction of  GDP.  The purpose of the ratio is to provide context, using GDP as a  proxy for the size of the economy.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=eS7"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=eS7" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 6, Federal Receipts as a fraction of GDP</div>
<p>As you can see, revenues/GDP are in a historically low range.</p>
<p>Conclusions:<br />&#8211; Federal spending is flat in nominal dollar terms.<br />&#8211; Federal spending is declining when adjusted for inflation and population growth.<br />&#8211; Federal revenues are far below trend lines based on any historical reference you chose.<br />&#8211; Federal revenues as a fraction of GDP are historically low.<br />&#8211; The Republican claim that we have a spending problem not a revenue problem is simply a lie, on both counts.<br />&#8211; Disproportional spending growth has only occurred under two presidents: Republicans Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.  </p>
<p>The simple fact is we have a revenue problem, not a spending problem.</p>
<p>Why do Republicans lie?</p>
<p>The truth is hostile to their agenda.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2013/01/paul-krugman-deficit-hawks-down.html">PK Explains</a>.</p>

<div dir="ltr">Politico’s Glenn Thrush <a href="http://www.politico.com/politico44/2013/01/obamas-gdp-nightmare-155645.html?hp=l4">reports this morning</a> that Republicans believe the GDP report showing the economy is shrinking gives them political “leverage” over Obama, since bad economic news is terrible for the President. But Thrush notes that this shouldn’t be the case, since the contraction was the result of spending cuts, which in theory should undermine the GOP argument that we should cut spending as deeply as possible:</div>
<div dir="ltr">The fact that the shock this time came from a plunge in defense/federal spending should, in theory, bolster Obama’s contention that budget-cutting and trimming entitlement spending is the worst thing for the economy right now. It should, in a more Spock-like world, be an argument against the sequester cuts and big changes to Medicare and Social Security. </div>

<div dir="ltr">All nuance is lost in the howling gale of an economic “contraction” — and the advantage, at least in the current news cycle, shifts to a down-in-mouth GOP. It’s not likely to be a major shift in the dynamics of looming fiscal fights, but Republicans, in the words of one senior Hill staffer I spoke to this morning, “will take any leverage we can get.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Thrush very well be right that people won’t take the right message from the contraction. But in a rational world, what should be glaringly obvious is that the belief that this gives the party “leverage” highlights how absurdly incoherent the GOP message about the economy has become. (Read S<a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/01/31/16789587-diagnosing-the-gdp-problem?lite">teve Benen for all the other problems here</a>.)</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The economic contraction was driven largely by a steep drop in defense spending. As <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/30/government-is-hurting-the-economy-by-spending-too-little/?wprss=rss_business">Ezra Klein details</a>, this shows that “government is hurting the recovery” by “spending and investing too little.” As Ezra notes, “government spending and investment have, at all levels, been contractionary since 2010.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Yet Republicans are responding to the news of the economic contraction by suggesting invalidates their view that we need to further cut spending to help the economy. Hence their claimed “leverage” in the coming battle over the sequestered cuts, half of which is to defense spending. Republicans are actively using the sequester to force Dems to agree to avert it by offsetting it entirely with other deep cuts to social programs, and no new revenues from the wealthy. In response to the contraction, John Boehner <a href="https://twitter.com/johnboehner/status/296647347096674304">tweeted out this hashtag</a>:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">#spendingistheproblem</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">In other words, the contraction confirms that we need more spending cuts.</div>

<p>Okay, look.  If Obama doesn’t now, finally, explain Keynesian economics to the general public, using actual facts&#8211;such as the reason for the economic contraction&#8211;and point out that Boehner &#038; Co. either are ignorant of the facts or are willing to deliberately misinform the public about such a critically important matter, then he should resign and let Joe Biden explain it as president.  </p>
<p>I mean it. </p>
<p>Obama did a stellar job a week before his inaugural address explaining the debt ceiling law and what “raising the debt ceiling” means&#8211;and that ti does not mean what the Republicans’ campaign of disinformation was saying it means.  He should do the same now, on this.  </p>
<p>Presumably, he’ll enlist as his chief speechwriter for his State of the Union address a speechwriter who understands how to easily explain Keynesian economics and the current “contraction” statistics.  But, just as with his inaugural address, he should not wait until that speech to expose the Republican game plan for what it is: a concerted campaign to misinform the public about critical facts, knowing that the public will not know the accurate specifics, and aware that&#8211;as Thrush says, outright&#8211;the mainstream press will not sufficiently (or at all) apprise the public of those fact.  </p>
<p>In other words: that Romneyism&#8211;the flagrant lying, con artistry, as the chief modus operandi&#8211;is now at the very heart of what the Republican Party is.</p>
<p>The public did catch on to Romney by the fall.  And, thanks largely to Obama’s statements at his press conference on Jan. 14 abou the debt ceiling, they caught on to that, as well.  And if Obama makes an effort to explain to the public basic Keynesian economics, and cites actual facts, actual statistics, about the fourth-quarter contraction, they’ll catch on this time, too.  And, maybe, finally, to the fact that the Republicans have decided upon a strategy of fraud in order to disassemble the social safety network, including Social Security and Medicare.  </p>
<p>In his State of the Union address, he’ll have an opportunity to finally educate the public about the actual causes of the Greek meltdown, of the actual effect of Tory austerity in Britain, of the actual cause of economic near-collapse in Spain, in Italy, in Ireland, in Iceland&#8211;and of the actual effect of the safety net in Germany, in Holland, and elsewhere.  And maybe he’ll even take that opportunity.  But the State of the Union address is two weeks away.  And in responding to Boehner’s tweet at #spendingistheproblem, there’s no time like the present.  Or at least like the next few days.  Just as with the fiscal cliff and the debt ceiling, the Republicans’ political leverage, whether real or fanciful, will turn out to be ephemeral.  </p>
<p>Unless Obama remains mute. 
<div></div>

<div>UPDATE: Wow.  Either Greg Sargent is channeling me, or I’m channeling him.  He posted <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/01/31/make-strong-case-that-spending-cuts-hurt-economy-mr-president/">this</a> one minute after I posted my post on AB. </div>
<p>But as I say in my post, Obama shouldn’t wait the two weeks until the State of the Union address to begin making the point.  Just as he didn’t wait a week until his inaugural address to explain to the public what “raising the debt ceiling” actually means&#8211;thus pulling the rug out from under Repubs’ disinformation campaign telling the public that it means increasing spending appropriations.  </p>
<p>Sargent titles his post “Make strong case that spending cuts hurt economy, Mr. President!”  (Amen.)  He points out: that</p>
<div dir="ltr">Unfortunately, at times, Obama has diluted this message. During his 2010 State of the Union speech, for instance, the President proposed a temporary spending freeze, and said:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“Families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do the same.”</div>
<div dir="ltr">  </div>
<p>But I think it’s a mischaracterization to describe that as a dilution of the Keynesian message.  It’s actually an outright misrepresentation of economic fact; that’s why that statement has been so detrimental.  And, if necessary, Obama should expressly acknowledge that this was misleading about economic fact, and then explain exactly why. </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>There were three big political stories that came out of David Gregory’s fabulously interesting interview of Paul Ryan aired last Sunday on Meet the Press.  One was that Ryan said: </p>
<div dir="ltr">Well, we can debate the efficacy of Keynesian economics or not. And I don’t obviously believe– I think the debt is pretty clear it doesn’t work.</div>
<p>Another was that he said that if Bill Clinton were president, we would have solved the budget-deficit problem, a statement that he presumably bases on the fact that when Bill Clinton was president, he solved the budget-deficit problem.</p>
<p>The third headline-grabber from that interview was that the Republicans will allow the “sequester” to take effect, presumably because they think it’s pretty clear that Keynesian economics doesn’t work, and because Bill Clinton is not longer president.  If Bill Clinton were president, the Republicans would allow him to raise tax rates to the level he did in 2001, this time without having to have the vice president cast the 51st vote in the Senate for the tax increase, and with enough Republican votes in the House to allow a vote on the tax increase.  </p>
<p>In other words, if Bill Clinton were president, Ryan and his compadres would not keep refusing to allow the Bush tax cuts on annual incomes of less than $450,000, and tax cuts on corporations, capital gains, and dividends, to expire.  But because Obama, rather than Clinton, is president, they won’t. They should be allowed to expire, Ryan says.  But they won’t be allowed to expire, because Obama is president.</p>
<p>Instead, the Republicans will opt to test out the the efficacy of Keynesian economics, or not&#8211;depending, probably, on whether <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/chuck-hagel-is-threat-to-americas.html">the Koch Brothers pick up the phone and disabuse Ryan of his belief that Keynesian economics doesn’t work</a>.  Before Wall Street does.  </p>
<p>Here’s what I obviously don’t believe: That if Ryan actually obviously doesn’t believe&#8211;thinks the debt is pretty clear it doesn’t work&#8211;he has even basic knowledge of past and current economic fact.</p>
<p>I’ll take his word for it that he was being truthful about his belief. But I sort of expect that the Koch brothers <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/sequestration-looms-contractors-dont-fret/2013/01/30/3bcf60ea-6b0a-11e2-af53-7b2b2a7510a8_print.html">and others</a> will educate him and other congressional Republicans who hold that belief, very soon. </p>

                                <p>This coming weekend is the annual Jon Swift Memorial Blogroll Amnesty, the reasoned, proportionate response to some of the Bigger Names suddenly deciding that they needed to cull their recommendations.  Swift’s brilliant (and certainly modest) proposal was that you should instead find five blogs with <em>lower</em> hits than you and recommend (i.e., <em>promote</em>) them, not drop them.</p>
<p>I don’t need to tell you to read Brad DeLong or Mark Thoma or Bill McBride—or David Altig or David Beckworth.or Jared Bernstein. Or anyone else who is probably already on the AB blog roll.<br />Things that have been disappearing from view as Blogroll Amnesty Years pass:
<ul>
<li>Single-person blogs </li>
<li>Blogs that are not always updated daily </li>
<li>Blogs that are not themed but are rather “what the owner feels like mentioning” </li>
</ul>
<p>The following five are my recommendations for this year, in alphabetical order:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.andrewrickard.ca/">Andrew Rickard</a> (updated almost every day; in perfect timing, just went on a week’s hiatus) </li>
<li><a href="http://boatagainstthecurrent.blogspot.com/">A Boat Against the Current</a> (Mike does update almost every day) </li>
<li><a href="http://agonyin8fits.blogspot.com/">The Hunting of the Snark</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://tomdup.wordpress.com/">You and Me, Dupree</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://underbelly-buce.blogspot.com/">Underbelly</a> (who sent me to Andrew Rickard)
<p>and a bonus one, because you can never have enough (a) Canadian content or (b) <em>food</em> blogs, let alone both:      </li>
<li><a href="http://doubletroublekitchenedition.blogspot.com/">Double Trouble, Kitchen Edition</a> </li>

Nick Ryan, an adviser to Republican US Representative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Nussle">Jim Nussle</a>, founded the organization in 2007, with Nicole Schlinger, a GOP leader in Iowa, as its president.

<p>Add to the Activities list an anti-Chuck Hagel TV ad. </p>
<p>Okay.  So I happened to catch a segment on CNBC just now (don’t ask; catching segments on CNBC is not quite part of my normal daily routine) that ended with an ad blasting Hagel for … um … a whole lot of stuff geared toward making people think he would have lots of conflicts of interest if confirmed as Secretary of Defense, even if he sells all those financial interests in defense contractor companies that the ad says he has, and in that company that invests in Iran, and stops flying on corporate jets. </p>
<p>At the end of the ad, the viewer is told that it’s sponsored by The American Future Fund.  Which I couldn’t identify from memory, since the names of these organizations all sound alike.  And are all very interested in America’s future.  </p>
<p>But, having seen the ad, I now knew that Hagel would be a very dangerous guy to have as Defense Secretary.  I just didn’t know who exactly he posed a danger to.  But thanks to Wikipedia, I know now.</p>
<p>Sounds to me like Paul Ryan should have consulted the Koch brothers before he declared on Meet the Press last weekend that Keynesian economics has proved to be a failure.  If you get my drift.  Those oil and gas subsidies and defense contracts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_Industries">that the Koch businesses receive</a> are important to our national defense &#8230; and to the economy.*

                                <p>If I could put my Vulgat Marxist hat on for a second another major difference between an invested pension fund and Social Security is that the fiormer fattens its balance by maximizing the extraction of value from labor productivity (and so increases ROI on capital) where SS thrives when labor retains as large a share of its own productivity as is consistent with drawing needed capital investment. And while some would argue that any reduction in ROI automatically leads to Capital Going Galt, the real world suggests that some capitalists will stick around even at smaller margins. (Not every pizza maker wants to be Pizz-onaire like Papa John, some just want to run a nice pizzeria)</p>
<p>Back in 2005 Dean Baker put forth his NELB (No Economist Left Behind) Challenge that demanded that privatizers show how they could get historic ROI on equities using the economic numbers assumed for Intermediate Cost {Dean didn&#8217;t formulate it this way, blame me and not him}. And some people claim to have met the challenge, but on inspection it SS by drawing much of their return by moving production overseas and so maintaining productivity at the cost of American worker wage. Left unexplained was how this magic was supposed to work when those same workers were being called to fund their private accounts out of now decreased wages so as to share in gains of even more suppressed wages of overseas workers was left unexplained.</p>
<p>That is you don&#8217;t have to be a full throated advocate of Labor Theory of Value to understand that ROI on production investment depends crucially on cutting labor costs for any given productivity unit. And conversely Real Wage increases by taking a bigger share of productivity gains.</p>
<p>This to me explains why union pension funds heavily invested in company stock will almost always come a cropper. Managements need to maximize ROI for stockholders as a whole in practice means starving the compensation of workers depending on the pension fund. Most easily by just deferring company contributions over time and then complaining about &#8216;unsustainable promises&#8217; based on &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217;. Social Security reduces the inclination for labor leaders and more senior vested members in the plan to buy in to &#8220;starve the new guy with two tier wages and shaft him by going from DB to DC with corporate &#8216;match&#8217; (if the match ever comes). Whereas SS benefits wherever actual wage compensation increases, whether that comes at the expense of ROI or not.</p>
<p>SS vs pensions is not just about time shift between contribution and payout, each reacts differently to Real Wage as share of productivity. Not in linear fashion. But still.<br />&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p> I agree in principle. Which suggests a discussion focused on three points:</p>
<p>One) what level of ultimate productivity does the current Intermediate Cost Alternative projection assume?</p>
<p>Two) is that level of productivity actually justifiable given all we know (or think we know) about future economic trends?</p>
<p>Three) are there ways to address productivity through policy so as to attain results above IC and approaching LC (Low Cost and also fully funded SS) numbers?</p>
<p>But we never have that discussion or indeed anyone actually using the ultimate productivity number in question. Instead we have hand waving that in effect asserts Intermediate Cost outcomes and then proposes solutions that implicitly rely on much better productivity numbers.</p>
<p>This shell game was highlighted in 2005 by Dean Baker with his NELB (No Economist Left Behind) Challenge which in effect asked privatizers to show how they could achieve traditional rates of return on equities given the productivity assumptions of Intermediate Cost.</p>
<p>And I added the request that if it became necessary for privatizers to adjust those productivity numbers up then that they should rescore Social Security outcomes.</p>
<p>The overall response to both challenges was crickets. But I haven&#8217;t given up hope that someone would step up to the plate. Either future productivity numbers are sucky enough that all retirement schemes are moot or there is some potential upside in the direction of SS solvency. But crisis mongers can&#8217;t have it both ways.</p>
<p>Maybe we are fucked. Fine admit that and we can move on to mitigation. Which won&#8217;t include magical returns on equities given IC productivity numbers. Over to you.</p>

<p>http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2012/V_B_econ.html#236399<br />Table V.B1.—Principal Economic Assumptions <br />Ultimate Productivity (2020 on) 1.68%<br />Ultimate Real Wage: 1.1%<br />http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2012/V_B_econ.html#223125<br />Real interest: 2.9%<br />Nominal interest: 5.7%<br />Unemployment: 5.5%<br />Real GDP: 2.1%</p>
<p>Are those really our best estimates of MEDIAN outcomes? Are there exactly no policy proposals that could target ANY of those numbers in ways that would improve solvency?</p>
<p>If so why? And why not? Until we actually have discussions focusing on the actual numbers underlying Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; I have to call bullshit. Note that the corresponding numbers for fully funded Low Cost are 2.8% Real GDP and 1.7% Productivity. Are those really such pie in the sky numbers that even results approaching them are out of the question? And if not how does that translate to solvency scoring?</p>
<p>Until I get some answers to those questions a few sorta lazy claims about productivity aren&#8217;t going to cut the mustard. MAKE me look like an uninformed IDIOT. Using NUMBERS.</p>

<p>Dell restructuring&#8211;all for a tax advantage?</p>
<p>David Cay Johnston writes for Tax Analysts, in <a href="http://taxanalysts.com/www/features.nsf/Articles/D8A55EFE6CF17A3885257B01006D4565?OpenDocument"> Dell&#8217;s Multiple Restructurings Aid It in Tax Avoidance</a> (2013), about a global reorganization disclosed by Dell in its January 2007 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_8-K">Form 8-K</a> filed with the SEC:  &#8220;just before the end of 2006, [Dell] issued more than 475 million shares worth $12 billion to invest in a subsidiary.&#8221;  In the Form 8-k, Dell notes that &#8220;Dell has modified the corporate structure of certain of its subsidiaries to achieve more integrated global operations and to provide various financial, operational and tax efficiencies&#8221;  (as quoted in the Johnston article).<br />
<blockquote>What Dell did was remake itself in a way that lets it escape taxes on profits earned in the United States by running them through a Netherlands entity and newly formed subsidiaries in Singapore and the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>Dell later quietly dropped the Singapore and Cayman Islands entities in what appears to be a pattern of remaking its corporate structure every few years. This nuanced timing pattern may have great significance as a tool for tax avoidance because <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">IRS</a> corporate audit practices were established on the assumption that companies tend to have stable structures. The IRS rarely audits newly formed entities.</p>
<p>The documents suggest that Dell created companies with no apparent purpose except to funnel profits into jurisdictions where they would be untaxed. In some cases, subsidiary names existed for a day or so and then were changed to the names of existing entities. The company shuffled its subsidiaries like a deck of cards &#8212; a deck stacked against shareholders and the IRS.</p>
<p>Sometimes the deals used companies with identical addresses, suggesting circular flows in which what would be taxable profits in the United States were run through offshore entities with no discernible purpose except escaping tax.  Id.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Describing the work of a couple who sleuthed through Dell&#8217;s state filings and court papers to examine its tax compliance, Johnston reports:<br />
<blockquote>Before one restructuring, Dell Inc. sold products to domestic customers through Dell Catalog Sales Corp., which shared the same address in Texas.<br />The couple distilled from annual corporate ownership and sales tax filings with state governments, as well as stipulations in various civil lawsuits, that Dell then replaced this simple organizational structure with a hierarchy of tax haven holding companies.</p>
<p>In all, Dell inserted four new companies between the parent and operating entities, which use the same Texas street address.</p>
<p>The result was that a Texas company reported to a Netherlands company that reported to a Singapore company that reported to a Caymans company that reported to what appears to be another Netherlands company that then reported back to the Texas headquarters.</p>
<p>This makes business sense? I cannot fathom how &#8212; except to escape taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>And because Dell publicly discloses its untaxed offshore profits and the expected tax rate upon repatriation of those profits, those numbers support the suggestion that the elaborate creation (and killing) of subsidiaries has one primary purpose&#8211;the reduction of taxes owed to the US.</p>
<blockquote><p>Citizens for Tax Justice, in a report last year (<em>Doc 2012-21457</em> , <em>2012 TNT 202-22</em>), noted that Dell is one of the few multinationals that discloses how much untaxed profits it holds offshore and the expected tax rate if it brought the money back to the United States.</p>
<p>Dell said it had $15.9 billion of untaxed profits offshore on which it would owe a tax of $5.2 billion, or 33 percent. Since that is almost equal to the 35 percent corporate tax rate, it suggests Dell paid virtually no tax anywhere in the world on those profits, because Congress gives a dollar-for-dollar tax credit on corporate income taxes imposed by other countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what, Johnston asks, is the public benefit of allowing this kind of corporate shell game?  He suggests that for shareholders, the question is whether they are being told enough to evaluate the risks and rewards of holding Dell securities.  And he concludes probably not.  For the IRS, it is whether regular audit techniques will miss what they should catch. And again, he wonders if the IRS policy of letting companies know what will be audited, sticking to those points, and completing audits in fixed time periods isn&#8217;t just a giveway to those who are manipulating their tax rates.  Dell&#8217;s tax counsel, he notes, would undoubtedly advise that they have reviewed each reorganization step and that they are perfectly legal.  </p>
<p>But Johnston wants an audit, and one that looks at the whay sophisticated companies are adept at working around audit policies.  Dell&#8217;s reorganizations, he says, are apparently timed at two-year intervals, injecting considerable complexity into the work of any IRS auditor trying to track their impact. And &#8220;the business purpose for this management structure is elusive&#8221;, he notes, on one set of slides showing a shuffle of entities that ultimately lands a company still located in Texas under a foreign sandwich of companies and ultimately avoiding US tax on the operating company income. He surmises that Dell owes a billion or more in US corporate income taxes that have escaped capture because of this endless restructuring.</p>
