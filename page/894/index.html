                                                                    </div>

                                <p>If I had a nickel for every time <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/23/AR2007022300785.html">Dick Cheney</a> contradicted himself:<br />
<blockquote>Vice President Cheney today repeated his charge that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s approach toward the Iraq war would benefit al-Qaeda, saying that he was not trying to impugn the speaker&#8217;s patriotism but instead hold her accountable for the consequences of her policies. Continuing a feud that broke out earlier in the week, Cheney said that Democratic proposals to restrict some Iraq war funding &#8211; what he dubbed the &#8220;Pelosi policy&#8221; &#8211; would amount to a broad validation of al-Qaeda efforts to undermine America&#8217;s will to fight.</p></blockquote>
<p>What was that?  <strong>The Pelosi policy?</strong>  And these fools kept repeating ad nauseam that the Democrats had no policy ideas.  OK, we did but Dick Cheney can’t listen to good ideas.  It wouldn’t be prudent.  Never mind the fact that the stupid decision on 3/19/2003 was seen by Osama bin Laden as a gift from God.  Why?  It gave bin Laden American boots on the ground in a Muslim land.  But Five Deferment Dick doesn’t get that.  But we have yet to come to the real howler:<br />
<blockquote>But in a new interview with ABC television on Friday, Cheney said that patriotism had nothing to do with his comments. Instead, he charged Democrats were trying to win public support by criticizing the war without taking responsibility for the repercussions.  &#8220;She accused me of questioning her patriotism. I didn&#8217;t question her patriotism. I questioned her judgment,&#8221; Cheney said during a trip to Australia</p></blockquote>
<p>Why did we have this Axis of Evil campaign in 2002?  Oh yea – the drum up votes for the GOP.  And taking responsibility?  Dick would never do that!  Not for this chaotic and destructive war.  Not for all his partisan lies questioning the patriotism of others.  </p>
<p>But <strong>JUDGMENT</strong>?  I would not dare question the judgment of Dick Cheney as he has NONE.  </p>
<p>Of course – did you notice that big brave Dick didn’t say this to Ms. Pelosi to her face?  No, he is way over in Australia as he pops his mouth off again.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070224/ap_on_el_pr/obama2008">Barack Obama</a> has some fun with Dick Cheney’s judgment:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Now, keep in mind, this is the same guy that said we&#8217;d be greeted as liberators, the same guy that said that we&#8217;re in the last throes. I&#8217;m sure he forecast sun today,&#8221; Obama said to laughter from supporters holding campaign signs over their heads to keep dry. &#8220;When Dick Cheney says it&#8217;s a good thing, you know that you&#8217;ve probably got some big problems.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – it was raining.  The old joke is that economists forecast to make the weather man look good.  But there is no way to make Cheney look good.</p>

                                <p>Mark Thoma does us all a favor for emailing a link to <em>The Lies They Tell: How to Stop the Fox Propaganda Machine</em> by <a href="http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/48286">Don Hazen</a>:<br />
<blockquote>As presidential aspirants announce their candidacies in an already mind-numbing procession, the &#8220;Sliming Bowl&#8221; is well under way. No candidate has been smeared more than Barack Obama, and no smearer more relentless than Fox News, as the short video (right) by Brave New Films demonstrates. &#8220;Sliming&#8221; is the rabid, rapid, media barrage of persistently repeated lies and innuendo mastered by the right-wing media machine, which aims to tar candidates with negative associations before their campaigns get rolling. Or alternatively, to bruise them enough so that they will suffer under the burden of damaged goods as they try to gain footing. The conservative roots usually puts out a speculative story through Fox News or Matt Drudge (of the Drudge Report), a powerful mouthpiece for the Bush White House. Then the right-wing echo reverberates as the lies make their way to talk radio and the right-wing blogosphere. Eventually, it gets picked up and carried by the mainstream media, with few understanding where the story originated.</p></blockquote>
<p>And how does Don Hazen back up his allegation?  Simple – he has a video showing actual footage from Faux News.  Check it out.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002873.html">Max Sawicky</a> takes exception to a post from <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/barney_frank_ex.html">Mark Thoma</a> on the Barney Frank v. Ben Bernanke debate.  Max has afforded us with a couple of opportunities starting with how Mark was criticizing Congressman Franks for criticizing Chairman Ben.  Criticize the criticism?  Wasn’t that the Taliban’s reaction to 9/11?</p>
<p>But back to the economics, which we also discussed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/washington-post-must-have-evidence-on.html">here</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The current Employment to Population Ratio is 63.3% and my guess has been that the natural rate is closer to 64%. Some of our conservative blogging economist friends have suggested it might be a little lower than my guess. If Chairman Ben thinks the natural rate is closer to 63.5%, then fine. But there is not a “large body of research” proving me right and him wrong nor visa versa.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max’s beef with Mark is stated succinctly:<br />
<blockquote>his argument is mostly from authority. This is what economists think, Barney means well but is on the wrong page.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max backs up his claim that some economists on the same “wrong” page as the Congressmen in two ways.  First up is <a href="http://maxspeak.org/baker1.html">Dean Baker</a> on the Death of the NAIRU theory:<br />
<blockquote>Contrary to Friedman’s view, the economics profession ignored the fact that the Greenspan experiment had contradicted its longstanding views on the NAIRU. Instead, the theory was modified to allow for possibility that the NAIRU could shift unexpectedly in unpredictable ways. Hence, we see that economic theories are not discarded because they are falsified.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next up is <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/webfeatures_viewpoints_monetary_plcy_economy">Jared Bernstein</a> with charts showing the gap between productivity and real compensation as well as a chart suggesting a time-varying NAIRU with the following caveat:<br />
<blockquote>Like many economists today, I consider the NAIRU to be a poor guidepost for policy makers. Events have overtaken the original model, and while some useful advances have been made (Ball and Moffitt, 2001), the evidence I present below suggests that subscribing to the model risks persistent and unnecessary slack in the economy, wasting billions of dollars and consigning millions of potential workers to fewer job opportunities and lower wages than should be the case.</p></blockquote>
<p>This debate as to what the labor market would look like if we were at full employment dates back to when Arthur Okun suggested his measure of the GNP gap over 40 years ago.  Okun suggested his infamous “law” as a proxy – not as some well accepted measure that all economists had to agree with.  To suggest there is some authority as to whether we are at full employment would be to ignore the great debate among blogging economists as to why real compensation has been so flat for so long.  I’m in the camp that we are still short of full employment, which must mean I’m on the wrong page too.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I think VisiCalc was the first killer app.  It was superseded, spreadsheet-wise, by Lotus 123, which was eventually beaten out by Excel (with its ally, vaporware).  I think Lotus is still around somewhere, but has only a small number of users.  And there are other spreadsheets around, but at present, Excel is the big boy.  Excel&#8217;s dominance is partly a matter of marketing (I alluded to vaporware, but there are other ways its been well-marketed), partly a matter of Microsoft making it work with other programs (the whole Office suite), and partly a matter momentum (at least now).  But the important thing is that software, like living creatures, evolves, and often for the same reason.</p>
<p>I was thinking of that yesterday while attending a bris.  I realized that in some ways, religions are like spreadsheet software, or any other product for that matter.  One of the reasons there are (relatively) few Jews in this world is marketing&#8230;  the biggest Jewish holiday (Yom Kippur) involves lack of eating for 24 hours.  As to big events in the life of a Jew, well, let&#8217;s just say that a bris not entirely inspirational, even when the mohel is very good.  Then there&#8217;s the whole issue of conversion &#8211; if a non-Jew wants to become a Jew, its possible, but it takes effort.</p>
<p>Christianity, at least the early version (which has become what we call Catholicism &#8211; and yes, I know I&#8217;m glossing) was set up to make converts easily.  This was done by mostly by Paul, who came around and decided that some of the rules God put out and Jesus adhered to were un-necessary (e.g., being kosher, circumcision, etc.).  Also, somewhere along the way (Paul again?) the whole communist nature (see the story of Ananias and Saphira, not to say the way Jesus and his disciples lived) of the faith disappeared.  As with kibbutzim, it served to bring in a dedicated core, but but wasn&#8217;t good for growth once that core group was achieved.  Additionally, becoming a Catholic is easy relative to becoming a Jew, and Catholics prosletyze.  One other thing&#8230;  Catholics described the rewards of Heaven, and punishment of Hell.  (For Jews, the afterlife concept seems rather nebulous.)</p>
<p>Protestant Christianity took marketing a step further.   The service was made easier to follow and more interesting, conversion was made easier, the Heaven and Hell thing has become a bit more central, etc.</p>
<p>Islam has some parallels with Protestant Christianity (the afterlife is defined much better, conversion requires only uttering the shahada, the faith actively seeks converts, etc.), as does the LDS.  (I realize the LDS considers itself Christian, but it does have a whole additional theology.)  Some of the steps these faiths have taken to attract converts sometimes backfire (again, with LDS &#8211; the practice of retroactively baptizing the dead doesn&#8217;t necessarilly lead to more living adherents, though I realize that&#8217;s not the point).  </p>
<p>But, in any case, quite ironically (at least to me) given the views of some of their proponents, religions evolve.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Update.  Its been pointed out that perhaps this post reads as offensive to people of faith.  Its not intentional.  My intention was to point out that over time, religions (at least those that have thrived) have become more sophisticated, adopting traits that work and losing traits that do not.  Hence, if you look at a religion as a species, there is evolution.  And I felt that was ironic because there are many people of faith who do not believe in evolution.</p>

                                <p>I have had it with the neocon nonsense.  The latest may have started with <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=2891738">Dick Cheney</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Cheney also had harsh words for Democratic leaders, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Jack Murtha, D-Pa., who says he wants to stop the surge of more U.S. troops into Iraq. Cheney said Pelosi and other Democrats were pushing a policy in Iraq that would &#8220;validate the al Qaeda strategy.&#8221; &#8220;I think if we were to do what Speaker Pelosi and Congressman Murtha are suggesting, all we&#8217;ll do is validate the al Qaeda strategy,&#8221; Cheney told ABC News.</p></blockquote>
<p>When he did, I yawned as this is standard faire for foul-mouthed, dishonest, draft dodging POS who is rich only because he defrauded the shareholders of Halliburton with Andersen’s assistance and he milked the defense procurement “rules” he designed as DoD secretary (incidentally, why would one choose a draft dodger to run the Defense Department).  But the bully didn’t expect a <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/blog/?p=47">Madame Speaker</a> to hit back:<br />
<blockquote>Vice President Cheney continues to question the patriotism of those of us in Congress who challenge the Bush Administration’s misguided policies in Iraq, but his latest attack is beneath the office of the Vice President, especially at a time of war. Mischaracterizations by the Vice President will not dissuade Congress from developing, on a bipartisan basis, a responsible new direction for U.S. policy in Iraq that brings our troops home safely and soon. I hope the President will repudiate and distance himself from the Vice President’s remarks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch!  Given that Five Deferment Dick is a coward, he needed some help from the <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/02/22/cheney-attacks-murtha">White House Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino</a><br />
<blockquote>QUESTION: Was he at all out of line in making those comments?<br />PERINO: The Vice President out of line? Absolutely not.  He was questioning the merits of the &#8211; of their proposal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry for the sexist line – but President Bush has to send one woman out as another woman was standing up to the lying POS we have to endure as Vice President.  While that’s pathetic enough (I guess we now know why Vietnam Vets never wanted to serve side by side with the coward known as Dick Cheney).  But think about the phrase “merits” as in the merits of the stupidest decision ever made – the one on March 19, 2003 to invade Iraq.  Two things are clear – Al Qaeda was revived. And Iran is king of the hill in the Middle East.  I would suspect most Americans would think of Al Qaeda is an enemy and this Iranian government is not exactly the ally of most rational Americans.  And yet, George W. Bush has given both a huge upper hand in accomplishing their goals.  Am I questioning the patriotism of George W. Bush?  Am I calling him a traitor?  OK, I’m not using the weasel words of Dana Perino.  I am questioning the patriotism of that terrorist we have to endure as President for the next couple of years. </p>
<p><strong>Memo to Dick Cheney</strong>: next time Nancy Pelosi comes after you, might I suggest standing behind the skirts of a gal who knows how to <a href="http://www.cynthiarothrock.org/">fight</a>.</p>

                                <p>Angry Bear is not one of the big blogs.  Sure, as one of the writers for Angry Bear, I’d love the ego boost of seeing the blog climb into the stratosphere of blogdom, but its not going to happen.  We focus too much on Economics, which everyone knows is boring, and even among the boring Economics blogs, there are others that are more popular.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised to see a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/iraq-it-gets-worse.html">trackback</a> in one of my posts.  It wasn’t a great post, nor even about economics… just referencing an article about how some National Guard units were short on rifles, mortars, and howitzers.  Anyway, the trackback led to <a href="http://morethanloans.blogspot.com/2007/02/rifles-and-nonsense.html">this post</a> at a blog called “More than Loans.”  </p>
<p>The blogger was criticizing me as an example of the lefties looking for a way to criticize the administration for sending troops into harm’s way with inadequate equipment.  OK.  Guilty as charged.  Now that I’m outed, I guess I have to admit that:</p>
<p>1.  I understand that soldiers really have enough equipment.  Its all sitting in Iraq, greased (when appropriate), wrapped and accounted for.  So the fact that soldiers are training with rifles when they’re going to use carbines in Iraq is no big deal.  (I assume they&#8217;re at least training with rifles.)  Its especially not a big deal for the soldiers that will be deployed in the surge in urban areas, such as Sadr City.  After all, what difference is there between a rifle and a carbine after all when it comes to house to house fighting?<br />2.  I understand that rifles and carbines are left behind in Iraq rather than shipped back with the soldiers to whom they were assigned because of concerns about weight.  <br />3.  I understand that there are more than enough soldiers.  The military is turning away recruits because so many patriotic Americans are leaping at the chance to go fight off Iraqi insurgents.  I understand that the National Guard troops being sent to Iraq for the second time (or is it third) volunteered to be there.  They signed up fully expecting to go to Iraq, insisting that they really would rather perform the typical National Guard-type duties.  (And who wouldn’t?  If only those National Guard types didn’t hog all the good spots there’d be room for some of the more patriotic folk to go to the sandbox.) <br />4.  I understand that there are more than enough allies.  And the British drawdown demonstrates yet again that we’re winning.  <br />5.  I understand that there is no history of ethnic strife in Iraq.  A few dead enders and a few foreign Al Qaeda types are causing the problems.<br />6.  I understand that the media still refuses to show pictures or the schoolhouses being painted – if they did, the American public would understand that we’re winning.  <br />7.  I understand that catching Osama is irrelevant.  I understand that if he is ever caught, it won’t be irrelevant then.<br />8.  I understand that the resurgence of the Taliban is irrelevant.<br />9.  I understand that Pakistan is our ally.  And so is Saudi Arabia.  <br />10.  I understand Iraq had everything to do with 9/11. <br />11.  I understand American troops are well taken care of when they’re wounded.<br />12.  I understand Bush has a plan.  And its going to work.  Like his other plans.</p>
<p>I can’t end with 12… so here’s lucky number 13…</p>
<p>13.  I understand that its my fault.  </p>
<p>What I don’t understand is something else on the “More than Loans” site.  He has a little logo with a plane and a flag and the words “I am pro-victory.”  I don’t understand what that means.  I don’t know what victory in Iraq means at this point.  And I wonder how that attitude differs from what the rest of us think or want.  (Are the rest of us for defeat?  Or a violent and warlike Iraq?)  And I wonder what actions differentiate those who are pro-victory from those who are not.</p>

                                <p>Regular readers may recall that the Ex-Girlfriend is addicted to Starbucks espresso.  (Everybody needs a character flaw.)  Anyway, we got an espresso-maker as a wedding gift, and this morning she was puttering around the kitchen making noises for a while, and then the espresso-maker started doing the same.  Eventually, it spit out some black liquid made with beans purchased at Trader Joe&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The Ex-Girlfriend pronounced the coffee inadequate &#8211; &#8220;not as good as Starbucks.&#8221;  Since it was her first time doing it, the process was repeated:  Ex-Girlfriend made noises, espresso-maker made noises, liquid was expelled, and liquid was pronounced undrinkable.  </p>
<p>As I write, the Ex-Girlfriend is putting on shoes and is about to head to Starbucks.  She asked me to convey some questions&#8230;.</p>
<p>If she were to ask the Starbucks folks what blend they use, would they tell her?  Do they sell that precise blend, or do the blends they sell differ from the ones they actually use?  Can readers recommend a blend that would taste good to someone whose taste buds are defective enough to enjoy Starbucks?</p>

                                <p>Via Steve Benen, <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10003.html">the scariest thing I&#8217;ve heard about Iraq so far</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maj. Gen. Harry M. Wyatt III, commander of the Oklahoma National Guard, told the NYT that one-third of his soldiers lacked the M-4 rifles preferred by active-duty soldiers and that there were also shortfalls in night vision goggles and other equipment. Capt. Christopher Heathscott, a spokesman for the Arkansas National Guard, said the state’s 39th Brigade Combat Team was 600 rifles short for its 3,500 soldiers and also lacked its full arsenal of mortars and howitzers.</p>
<p>Think about that — National Guard troops are training for another quick deployment, but some of these soldiers don’t even have the right rifles yet. Body armor and Humvee protection is one thing, but Guard troops don’t have the rifles they want?</p></blockquote>
<p>Two comments:<br />1. Bear in mind&#8230; these are National Guard troops&#8230; not regular military. Most of these folks would never have imagined they were going to be deployed abroad when they signed up. Who knows how many of them have been stop-lossed. Now, what? They&#8217;re supposed to throw rocks at the insurgents?<br />2. This kind of shortage didn&#8217;t just develop. Regardless of blame shifting, we&#8217;ve had a Republican Congress and a Republican administration for six years. Someone should be accountable for this mess.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Earlier this week I had a post looking at changes in the nominal money supply per capita.  I thought the changes hinted at the Fed behaving in ways intended to influence elections.  Others saw only coincidences. </p>
<p>So…  I worked on the data some more.  I adjusted for changes in population and inflation.  And I created a table (near the bottom of this post) that shows the 3 month change in real M2 per capita – that is, the change in M2 money over and above (or under and below) the rate of change of inflation per person.  </p>
<p>Before we look at the table, I’d like to tell you what I expected.  I figured the Fed does try to influence elections.  I would imagine it is more likely to favor incumbents (first, the incumbent is more likely to have appointed or re-appointed the Fed chair, and in 6 out of the 8 observations in the sample in which an incumbent has stood for re-election, the Fed chair came from the same party as the sitting incumbent).  </p>
<p>The way to influence an election is simple… increase the Money Supply in an unusual way (say, more than normal for that month of the year) in the months leading up to an election, making the public feel a bit more prosperous than they otherwise would.  However, to avoid inflation, in the months following an election, the Fed would have smaller increases in the Money Supply than usual for that month of the year.  </p>
<p>The table below shows the 3 month percent change in M2 up to each month of the calendar year.  Results are shown for all years, years preceding a Presidential election in which there is an incumbent, years in which there is a Presidential election in which there is an incumbent, and years after a Presidential election in which there is an incumbent.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rd22moVHjyI/AAAAAAAAAFM/MsQlFjuQNiA/s1600-h/Fed+Independence,+Table+1,+Second+pass.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rd22moVHjyI/AAAAAAAAAFM/MsQlFjuQNiA/s320/Fed+Independence,+Table+1,+Second+pass.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This seems to indicate that:</p>
<p>1.  The three month percentage change in real M2 per capita through September, October, and November seem to be unusually large in years in which an incumbent President is running for re-election<br />2.  The three month percentage change in real M2 per capita ending in December and January following an election in which an incumbent President is running for re-election are unusually low<br />3.  What I cannot explain – I didn’t make a prediction either way, but results strike me as a bit odd – is the fact that in the year before a presidential election in which an incumbent is running for re-election, changes in real M2 per capita are unusually high in many of the early months of the year.  Pure speculation….  It may be related to congressional elections… while most Presidents running for re-election were Republican, most Congresses running for re-election during the same period were Democrat.  Anyone else have a guess?</p>
<p>But, items 1 and 2 seem to indicate… the pattern of changes in the real money in the month of a Presidential election in which a sitting President is running for re-election, in the two months previous to that, and in the two months following that, just happen, by shear coincidence, to be precisely those one would expect if the Fed was trying to influence the election. </p>

<p>As always, let me know if you want my spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Also, if you’re interested in where I’m going, here’s my thought process.  I intend to examine this a bit further… I want to break out whether there’s a difference (as I expect there to be) between situations in which the incumbent and the Fed chairman come from the same party as opposed to different parties.  I also want to see what happens when the Fed chairman is a Republican as opposed to a Democrat.  There may be one or two more things to look at… then I want to get back to where I started last week, namely looking at the relationship between changes in the real money supply per capita and growth rates in the economy.</p>
<p>Update&#8230;.  corrected first sentence &#8211; error pointed out by reader Bobby Corcoran.</p>
<p>Update 2&#8230;  Reader Don Lloyd suggested that the Fed might think more in terms of nominal, non-per capita money.  The table below shows the changes in the nominal money supply, by month, in and around years in which an incumbent President sits for re-election.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I&#8217;m attending a bris today. (If you don&#8217;t know what it is, don&#8217;t look it up. If you insist on looking it up, don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you.) Assuming I&#8217;m well enough&#8230; I&#8217;m feeling kind of under the weather. The kid&#8217;s parents are very close friends of mine, and now of the ex-Girlfriend as well. They&#8217;re not at all religious.</p>
<p>When they got married, they had a recognizably Jewish ceremony. So did the ex-Girlfriend and I, though we&#8217;re not religious either. This phenomenon is not limited to Jews. I have close friends that are Catholic and various shades of Protestant that are not religious, and those that have been married have done so in ceremonies that are recognizably of the faith they are, um, nominally members of. One friend of mine who is Catholic goes to mass almost every Sunday, but its fairly obvious he doesn&#8217;t believe in God at all.</p>
<p>So why do people participate in these ceremonies in which they don&#8217;t believe?</p>
<p>I can think of several reasons for this:<br />1. Family pressures. <br />2. Social networking.<br />3. Bet hedging. (Pascal&#8217;s wager)<br />4. All of us really do believe.<br />5. We place some value on tradition or history.</p>
<p>I personally would answer #5. What else is there? What am I missing?</p>
