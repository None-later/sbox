<p>CoRev sends this note and picture. It is a good thing to see.  We can argue what the meaning is on a different day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wejustgotback.com/default.aspx?mod=may_memorialday">Celebrated</a> in a variety of ways, as a day to acknowledge sacrifice by soldiers who went to war, I have always felt conflicted about what to do on this day.  It is a day to honor the dead and a day to count your blessings.  It is a day to mourn remembered family and a day to tell a story of some kind of historical narrative.</p>
<p>Perhaps it also can be a day for those who fought to recount and record their experience on this day, and then tuck away the memories rarely shared to instruct another day.</p>

                                <p>Alice Rivlin teams with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/23/AR2008052302437.html">Michael O’Hanlon</a> to write:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1992, with his squeaky voice and endless charts, Perot focused attention on the rising federal deficit. His warnings helped keep the major-party candidates from talking budgetary nonsense &#8230; Federal debt, which fell to 57 percent of gross domestic product during the Clinton administration, is back up to about 68 percent, the highest percentage since the 1950s. Interest on the federal debt tops $200 billion a year, so we have to move quickly to avoid losing ground. Moreover, deficits are increasingly being financed by other countries, making us increasingly vulnerable to their agendas. All the candidates claim that their initiatives would not make future deficits bigger, but many of these claims are shaky at best &#8230; With his bold tax cuts and increases in defense spending, John McCain looks likely to do the most fiscal damage, but the Democrats are not far behind.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not about to endorse Ross Perot but Alice Rivlin certainly deserves a seat near the next President of the United States.</p>

<p>Unless I get some specific requests or questions, I expect to pull back some on this, and go back to a more bloggy thing of monitoring what people like Andrew Samwick and Andrew Biggs are saying and then as appropriate post on it here. But if you just have to have more of me I am sure the siteowners will forward on any and all story suggestions.</p>

<blockquote><p>LOS BAÑOS, Philippines — The brown plant hopper, an insect no bigger than a gnat, is multiplying by the billions and chewing through rice paddies in East Asia, threatening the diets of many poor people.</p>
<p>Luis Liwanag for The New York Times<br />Because subsidized rice is limited, people must take numbers when they line up to buy it in Los Baños in the Philippines. </p>
<p>The damage to rice crops, occurring at a time of scarcity and high prices, could have been prevented. Researchers at the <a href="http://www.irri.org/">International Rice Research Institute</a> here say that they know how to create rice varieties resistant to the insects but that budget cuts have prevented them from doing so.</p>
<p>This is a stark example of the many problems that are coming to light in the world’s agricultural system. Experts say that during the food surpluses of recent decades, governments and development agencies lost focus on the importance of helping poor countries improve their agriculture.</p>
<p>The budgets of institutions that delivered the world from famine in the 1970s, including the rice institute, have stagnated or fallen, even as the problems they were trying to solve became harder. </p>
<p>“People felt that the world food crisis was solved, that food security was no longer an issue, and it really fell off the agenda,” said Robert S. Zeigler, the director general of the rice institute.</p>
<p>Vital research programs have been slashed. At the rice institute, scientists have identified 14 genetic traits that could help rice plants survive the plant hopper, which sucks the juices out of young plants while infecting them with viruses. But the scientists have had no money to breed these traits into the world’s most widely used rice varieties.</p>
<p>The institute is the world’s main repository of rice seeds as well as genetic and other information about rice, the crop that feeds nearly half the world’s people. </p>
<p>But nowadays at the International Rice Research Institute, greenhouses have peeling paint and holes in their screens and walls. Hallways are dotted with empty offices. In the 1980s, the institute employed five entomologists, or insect experts, overseeing a staff of 200. Now it has one entomologist with a staff of eight. </p>
<p>“We’ve had an exodus here,” said Yvette Naredo, an assistant geneticist.</p>
<p>Similar troubles plague other centers in Asia, Africa and Latin America that work on crop productivity in poor countries. Agricultural experts have complained about the flagging efforts for years and warned of the risks. </p>
<p>“Nobody was listening,” said Thomas Lumpkin, director general of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico.</p>
<p>Now, a reckoning is at hand. Growth of the global food supply has slowed even as the population has continued to increase, and as economic growth is giving millions of poor people the money to buy more food.</p></blockquote>
<p>One has to connect some other dots as well. For instance, <a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/pubs/CFSMOnsantovsFarmerReport1.13.05.pdf">genetically modified rice</a> has been demonstrated to produce LESS rice per acreage than improved varieties made more traditionally. Monsanto has been so aggressive in its <a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/pubs/CFSMOnsantovsFarmerReport1.13.05.pdf">IP protection</a> that even contamination of a neighboring farm with its product is grounds for lawsuits claiming damage for the company. This cannot be good for competition, and tends to increase the &#8220;drain&#8221; part of farming in that new seed must be purchased each year.</p>
<p>Global warming has produced hotter night time temperatures that also reduce production, and in the short run of decades might produce profound changes in rice production patterns away from the tropics.</p>
<p>Index and futures markets appear to be de-coupling actual supply and demand factors from market behavior we count on to price, so greater variability is headed our way than even scarcity might indicate. </p>
<p>This affects distribution dramatically.</p>

When I try to make the <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/05/could-someone-explain-stolper-samuelson.html">Stolper-Samuelson</a> argument that wages in the apparel sector fall by more than apparel prices fell, James insists that <a href="http://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/christian.broda/website/research/unrestricted/Broda_TradeInequality.pdf">Christian Broda and John Romalis</a> addressed that in Inequality and Prices: Does China Benefit the Poor in America?:</p>
<blockquote><p>The debate on trade and wages in the U.S. has entirely focused on the impact that trade with developing countries has on the wages of the unskilled in America. This debate has overlooked the impact that trade has on prices of the goods consumed by different income groups. In particular, since developing countries typically produce low quality goods that are disproportionately consumed by the poor in America, this implies that inequality measures that do not correct for differences in the basket of goods consumed by rich and poor neglect this “price” effect of trade.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I concede we should look at both the price effect and the wage effect, doesn’t the Stolper-Samuelson effect consider both?  James did offer this comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for quoting Stolper-Samuelson, there are fewer than 900,000 apparel workers left in the U.S. There are 30 million+ low-income American consumers, the vast majority of whom don&#8217;t now and in fact never did work in industries that compete with China, who reap sizeable benefits &#8212; as Broda and Romalis document &#8212; from the lower prices that free trade with China has empirically brought. If you want to make the case that the costs to those apparel workers today (and to those who used to work in the apparel industry)outweigh the benefits to the consumers, then do it empirically, documenting the costs and benefits. Merely citing S+S doesn&#8217;t help you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, it is true that BLS cites that there were only 540,000 workers as of April 2008 in the following sectors: textile mills, textile mill products, apparel, and leather and allied products.  This is down from 1,822,000 as of January 1990 as our apparel sector has laid off many workers who likely found employment elsewhere but often at even lower wages.  As <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/261">Paul Krugman</a> noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1995 I also believed that the effects of trade on inequality would eventually hit a limit, because at a certain point advanced economies would run out of labour-intensive industries to lose – more formally, that we’d reach a point of complete specialisation, beyond which further growth in trade would have no further effects on wages. What has happened instead is that the limit keeps being pushed out, as trade creates “new” labour-intensive industries through the fragmentation of production.  For example, the manufacture of microprocessors for personal computers is clearly a highly sensitive, skill-intensive process. Intel’s microprocessor production, however, now takes place in two stages: the “fabs,” which print the circuits on disks of silicon, are all located in high-wage advanced countries, but the assembly and testing, in which those disks are cut into individual chips and tested to be sure that they work, is conducted in China, Malaysia, and the Philippines.  Outsourcing of services, in both directions, adds to the possibilities of unequalising trade. The skill-intensive pieces of production processes that mainly take place in the third world are often now located in the OECD – for example, Lenovo, the Chinese computer company, has its executive headquarters in North Carolina.  What all this comes down to is that it’s no longer safe to assert, as we could a dozen years ago, that the effects of trade on income distribution in wealthy countries are fairly minor. There’s now a good case that they are quite big, and getting bigger.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – focusing on those 540,000 apparel workers to access the impact on wages is incomplete and highly misleading.</p>

That is we are not talking about three random academics writing some paper, instead these are policy players working at the highest levels, no matter who wins this fall one or more of them will be sitting at the table when Social Security policy is hammered out. So LMS matters. A lot.</p>
<p>But first lets define some terms and lay out some baseline numbers. Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is normally associated with Trust Fund Depletion which is currently projected for 2041. Although people tend to refer to this event with reckless language like &#8216;broke&#8217;, &#8216;bankrupt&#8217; or &#8216;dead broke&#8217; which leads others to conclusions that &#8216;Social Security will not be there for me&#8217; or &#8216;no check&#8217;, ten seconds of informed thought tells us this is nonsense. As long at the payroll tax exists some level of benefits can be paid out and the Trustees tell us each year what that level is. With the 2008 Report the Trustees tell us that under Intermediate Cost assumptions that the benefit check will be cut sometime in 2041 to 78% of the scheduled benefit. Now given that the scheduled benefit would be 160% in real terms relative to the one a similarly situated retiree gets today and that 78% of 160% = 125% or a check 25% better in real terms than the one my Mom gets today some might question the whole notion of &#8216;crisis&#8217;. A topic that can be discussed in comments. But for now lets run with the number.</p>
<p>Okay so &#8216;crisis&#8217; is defined as 78%. What would a &#8216;fix&#8217; be. Well I am going to keep running with the Trustees here, they would define this is terms of Short Term and Long Term Actuarial Balance, meaning Social Security projected to end each year of the next ten or alternatively seventy-five years with a one year reserve. Which translates to 100% of the schedule. Moreover they tell us exactly what the cost of that fix would be if we chose to take a tax only approach. Per the 2008 Report that fix would require an immediate increase in the payroll tax of 1.7% which would take the FICA rate to 14.1%. We should note that when LMS was drafted the gap was 1.92%.</p>
<p>So now to LMS and Table 1 above, especially columns two and four where you have both halves of a couple surviving. One thing strikes you right away, LMS doesn&#8217;t actually promise you a fix as defined particularly for low earners, it only partially fills the gap. While some might be tempted to say &#8216;better something than nothing&#8217;, the devil is always in the details. A cost/benefit analysis of LMS lies below the fold.</p>
<p>Which takes us to Table 2 which scores the impact of LMS on the Trust Fund but which doesn&#8217;t tell the whole story. LMS at its core relies on PRAs (Personal Retirement Accounts) which are essentially government run IRAs that are considered to be outside the Trust Fund itself. If we take the totality of LMS what are the tax and benefit implications?</p>
<p>First LMS proposes a 1.5% across the board increase in payroll tax all of which gets put into the PRA. Additionally it proposes a partial lifting of the payroll cap for an additional 1.0% payroll equivalent. Which is to say that it proposes a 2.5% tax solution to a problem that had been scored at 1.92% and now is down to 1.7%. Given that we could achieve a &#8216;fix&#8217; as defined above for less than LMS it is clear that for the authors their &#8216;Reform&#8217; does not equate to our &#8216;fix&#8217;. But it gets even more interesting on the benefit side.</p>
<p>Along with the 2.5% total increase in payroll tax LMS also proposes a cut in the benefit from traditional Social Security benefit formula of 2.08% along with an increase in retirement age for an additional .68% for a total benefit cut of 2.7% once again much more than what we have described as &#8216;crisis&#8217; to begin with. So what we have is a tax increase that would more than &#8216;fix&#8217; &#8216;crisis&#8217; as we have defined these terms along with benefit cuts that would fix &#8216;crisis&#8217; in place. Which puts in place the dual questions &#8216;What does LMS actually accomplish?&#8217; and &#8216;Why should wage workers fund it to the equivalent of 5.2% of payroll (2.5% in taxes and 2.7% in cuts)?&#8217;</p>
<p>At this point serious students might want to follow the link and read the plan which is only nine pages. The first six and a half pages contain the pain. The putative gains start on page seven.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sustainable solvency is achieved&#8217;. The net result from LMS would be to put Social Security into a .22% payroll surplus when examined from the Social Security and hence General Fund side of the equation. That this comes at a cost of 5.2% total to workers when they could get a better outcome at 1.92% (then) or 1.7% (now) is apparently just the burden we owe to future generations. Because on examination it is clear that the authors of LMS have a quite different definition of &#8216;solvency&#8217; than say Coberly or I do. We like the fact that Social Security is a PayGo insurance plan with an intergenerational bargain of &#8216;you paid for my parents, I&#8217;ll pay for you, your kids can pay for me, and all with better real results as time goes on&#8217;. For the authors this situation is intolerable. Why? Well a fine topic for discussion in comments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fiscally responsible plan&#8221; Here I think the authors let the cat out of the bag, note how they word the issue (bolding mine):<br />
<blockquote>The plan puts great emphasis on fiscal responsibility – borrowing less from general revenues than any other plan that has been scored by the Social Security actuaries in recent years.  Table 3 compares the LMS plan with other recent Social Security reform plan.  The first column compares general fund transfers to the OASDI Trust Funds.  This is one measure of how much a plan relies upon unspecified resources from outside of Social Security to bring the system into balance.  The LMS plan does not rely at all on general fund transfers, and instead uses changes to <br />benefits and revenues to bring Social Security into balance.</p></blockquote>
<p>. This is rather odd. Under current law there is no question of Social Security borrowing anything from the General Fund, the obligation is the other direction in the form of repaying the money borrowed from current Social Security surpluses. The LMS formulation builds in a tricky duality. First it asserts that the unfunded liability beyond 2041 is real enough that the government would fill compelled to backfill it with &#8216;borrowing, then it writes it off anyway by proposing even bigger cuts sooner. To me that seems special pleading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many practical reforms are included&#8221;. All these reforms relate to administration of the plan and none actually to the issue of retirement security itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Economically beneficial&#8221; On my reading of the text on page nine this translates to &#8216;exercising fiscal restraint on Congress&#8217;, a good idea in itself but one that is difficult to justify by placing the entire cost on wage workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Balanced compromise&#8221;. I am not sure how a 5.2% bill for a problem scored at 1.92% is either balanced or any kind of a compromise, not at least from the perspective of workers. To me the whole thing looks like just trying to find the easiest path to screw over any concept of Social Democracy in favor for a everyman for himself philosophy typical of the Economic Right. In context &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; here is defined as compromise between the conservatives and the DLC/centrist wing of the Democratic Party, the concept that the New Dealers should have some voice is dismissed out of hand.</p>

<blockquote><p>With fuel prices soaring, the U.S. military, the country&#8217;s largest single consumer of oil, is turning into an alternative-fuels pioneer.  In March, Air Force Capt. Rick Fournier flew a B-1 stealth bomber code-named Dark 33 across this sprawling proving ground, to confirm for the first time that a plane could break the sound barrier using synthetic jet fuel. A similar formula &#8212; a blend of half-synthetic and half-conventional petroleum &#8212; has been used in some South African commercial airliners for years, but never in a jet going so fast … With oil&#8217;s multiyear ascent showing no signs of stopping &#8212; crude futures set another record Tuesday, closing at $129.07 a barrel in New York trading &#8212; energy security has emerged as a major concern for the Pentagon.  The U.S. military consumes 340,000 barrels of oil a day, or 1.5% of all of the oil used in the country. The Defense Department&#8217;s overall energy bill was $13.6 billion in 2006, the latest figure available &#8212; almost 25% higher than the year before. The Air Force&#8217;s bill for jet fuel alone has tripled in the past four years. When the White House submitted its latest budget request for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it tacked on a $2 billion surcharge for rising fuel costs.  Synthetic fuel, which can be made from coal or natural gas, is expensive now, but could cost far less than the current price of oil if it&#8217;s mass-produced.  Just as important, the military is increasingly concerned that its dependence on oil represents a strategic threat. U.S. forces in Iraq alone consume 40,000 barrels of oil a day trucked in from neighboring countries, and would be paralyzed without it. Energy-security advocates warn that terrorist attacks on oil refineries or tankers could cripple military operations around the world. &#8220;The endgame is to wean the dependence on foreign oil,&#8221; says Air Force Assistant Secretary William Anderson.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/05/war-for-oil-or-oil-for-war.html">Michael Perelman</a> has another take on the fact that the Iraq campaign is consuming so much oil:</p>
<blockquote><p>I suspect that these figures would be what uniformed personnel consumed. Maybe somebody here knows, but I feel fairly confident that contractors in Iraq &#8212; even contractors carrying out military missions &#8212; consume oil that escapes these estimates.  Wasting oil is nothing compared to wasting lives, but even so I can think of better uses for 340,000 barrels of oil a day.</p></blockquote>
<p>This war not only disrupted Iraqi oil supplies, it has also increased the demand for oil.  Isn’t it time to end this idiotic adventure before <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jQ7to4Zhf0BTz9HqeVbjvvgx9LUQD90QS17O0">Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani</a> succumbs to pressures to declare a fatwa on our troops:</p>
<blockquote><p>Iraq&#8217;s most influential Shiite cleric has been quietly issuing religious edicts declaring that armed resistance against U.S.-led foreign troops is permissible — a potentially significant shift by a key supporter of the Washington-backed government in Baghdad.The edicts, or fatwas, by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani suggest he seeks to sharpen his long-held opposition to American troops and counter the populist appeal of his main rivals, firebrand Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and his Mahdi Army militia.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I keep hearing on CNBC and reading at some blogs that if cars get better mileage that people  will drive more by enough to offset the improved mileage.</p>
<p>I can see that people could drive more because of the savings.  But to argue that reducing mileage by 20%, for example will lead to people increasing their driving by more then 20% seems like a very questionable conclusion. I&#8217;m willing to listen to an argument that increasing gas mileage would be partially offset by increased driving, but not that the responses would be more than 100%.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea of the original source or research of this belief by so many Republicans, Conservatives and Libertarians?</p>
<p>Is it just another Wall Street Journal editorial page finding that is too good to be true?</p>
