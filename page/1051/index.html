                                <p>How Machiavellian was the Nixon White House?  The reaction of some of Nixon’s aids to the news that Mark Felt was Deep Throat speaks volumes.  Consider this comment from <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0506/01/ltm.02.html">Gordon Liddy</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I view him as someone who violated the ethics of the law-enforcement profession, in that if he possessed evidence of wrongdoing, he was honor bound to take that to a grand jury and secure an indictment, not to selectively leak it to a single news source.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s remember Liddy’s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/watergate/liddy.html">role</a> as we also remember that President Nixon along with Haldeman and Ehrlichman were actively engaged in a cover-up that included the firing of Archibald Cox as prosecutor on October 20, 1973.  I’m sure Liddy et al. would have loved it had Mr. Felt limited his actions to the normal channels of the Justice Department.  </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8060320">Today Show</a> interviewed Charles Colson and Patrick Buchanan.  Buchanan argued that Felt cooperated with the Washington Post because he did not get a promotion and that the Post reporters were nothing but stenographers (as if journalism should be just making stuff up rather than telling one’s readers what your sources really said).  Buchanan also played the criticize the government = defaming the troops card:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, it brings you back to those days, and look, I think the breaking of Richard Nixon and the destruction of his presidency by people who had hated him for a long time &#8211; Nixon gave them the sword &#8211; that resulted in really pouring down a sewer really everything which 58,000 gave their lives in Vietnam. People forget that six months after Watergate, Nixon was at 69 percent, he had won 49 states, the POWs were coming home, every provincial capital was in South Vietnamese hands. Two years later, after he was destroyed, you had a holocaust of a million people dead in Cambodia. So I think that Mark Felt was ashamed at what he did.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the argument contradicts itself as Nixon ended our military involvement in Indochina before the Watergate crisis heated up.  But the most disturbing comments came from Colson:</p>
<blockquote><p>My experience with Mark Felt was that he was thoroughly professional each time I dealt with him. I trusted him completely. I was with the President one night and both the President and I talked to him on the phone, and I sensed that the President had a lot of trust in him.</p></blockquote>
<p>Colson went on to suggest that letting the public know the truth about the activities of this incredibly corrupt White House was itself corrupt and a violation of trust.  </p>
<p>I agree with those who say Mark Felt was a hero who helped purge such Machiavellian behavior from the White House, but the benefits lasted for just over a quarter of a century.  The current White House eclipses the Nixon White House in almost every dimension from abusing a war for partisan purposes to destroying anyone who dares to criticize its actions.  So is there a modern day version of Mark Felt?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006763">Peggy Noonan</a> says Mark Felt did a bad, bad thing:</p>
<blockquote><p>What Mr. Felt helped produce was a weakened president who was a serious president at a serious time. Nixon&#8217;s ruin led to a cascade of catastrophic events &#8211; the crude and humiliating abandonment of Vietnam and the Vietnamese, the rise of a monster named Pol Pot, and millions -millions &#8211; killed in his genocide. America lost confidence; the Soviet Union gained brazenness. What a terrible time. Is it terrible when an American president lies and surrounds himself by dirty tricksters? Yes, it is. How about the butchering of children in the South China Sea. Is that worse? Yes. Infinitely, unforgettably and forever.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peggy must be confused as to the chain of events that brought about the demise of <a href="http://www.khmerkampongspeu.org/lonnol.htm">Prince Sihanouk</a>.</p>

                                <p>As I start getting reaquainted with the financial press following my 10-day &#8216;vacation&#8217;, the first thing that has caught my attention is the continued fall in long-term interest rates.  The ‘conundrum’ about which Alan Greenspan spoke a few months ago has not resolved itself, after <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/interest-rate-mystery.html">briefly appearing</a> as though it might back in March.  Instead, the mystery has deepened, in the sense that long-term interest rates have fallen noticeably over the past month or two even though the Fed continues to increase short-term interest rates.  (See <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/three-discussions-of-low-long-rate.html">Mark Thoma</a> for a few more recent viewpoints about this puzzle, mystery, conundrum, or whatever you want to call it.)</p>
<p>The following chart shows the essence of the interest rate mystery: short-term rates keep rising, while long-term rates don’t.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/conundrum1.jpg"></p>
<p>Of particular surprise to many observers, in recent weeks the bond market has completely reversed the rise in yields that we saw a couple of months ago. This resounding defeat of the bond market bears has been so striking as to convince some of them, like <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/GEFdata/digests/20050531-tue.html">Stephen Roach</a>, to give up being a bear altogether.</p>
<p>I don’t have any new theories to offer to explain the mystery.  Just to recap, the prevailing theories to explain low long-term interest rates in the US are 1) the bond market expects the US economy to weaken, and thus expects inflation rates and private-sector borrowing needs to diminish; 2) corporate America is simply saving their profits, rather than spending them, thus limiting corporate borrowing needs and adding to current the supply of available savings; 3) there is a global glut of savings, which has driven interest rates down worldwide, including in the US; and 4) foreign central banks have been pushing such vast quantities of funds into the US treasury market that their actions have had a substantial impact on the US treasury market.</p>
<p>Obviously, these theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and the true explanation almost certainly involves some combination of some or all of these factors.  The real question is therefore whether we can gauge the relative importance of these different effects.</p>
<p>Some more data may help to provide some insight into what’s going on in the long-term bond market.  Plus, this is a good excuse for me to flex my slightly out-of-shape graphing muscles.  </p>
<p>First, let’s break the long-term yield into its two components: the portion of the yield that compensates investors for expected inflation over the life of the bond, and the portion of the yield that comprises the real (after inflation) underlying rate of return.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/conundrum2.jpg"><br />Note: the real yield is the 10-yr TIPS (inflation-indexed) interest rate, while inflation expectations are the difference between the TIPS rate and the nominal interest rate.</p>
<p>Interestingly, over the past couple of weeks the fall in yields has been almost entirely due to a fall in inflation expectations.  Meanwhile, the real (inflation-adjusted) yield has remained at historically low levels after a brief spike in March 2005. The recent decline in inflation expectations lends some support to hypothesis (1), that there is a growing belief that the US economy (or perhaps the world economy) may be weakening.</p>
<p>What about the idea that low US interest rates simply reflect low worldwide interest rates? The next chart compares long-term interest rates in the US with those of the euro zone:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/conundrum3.jpg"></p>
<p>Over the past six months an unusual gap has opened up between German government bond yields and US government bond yields.  This lends some credence to hypothesis (3), which suggests that today’s low long-term interest rates are a world-wide phenomenon rather than being particular to the US, and reflect a global abundance of savings and/or a dearth in global borrowing by corporations to undertake investment projects.  The gap also suggests that the bears were right and long-term interest rates in the US actually have risen &#8211; when compared to interest rates in the rest of the world.  <a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/setser/archives/2005/05/bretton_woods_t_1.html">Brad Setser</a> makes this point in a recent post.</p>
<p>My own particular take on this data is that I&#8217;m becoming more convinced that there is a growing sense in financial markets (at least the bond market) that economic growth is slowing, perhaps both in the US and in the rest of the world.  I’ve been a firm believer in the impact of Asian central bank reserve accumulation on US interest rates, as well, and I&#8217;m sure that CB purchases of US government bonds have exacerbated the interest rate mystery.  But I am becoming more and more convinced that there are other forces at work here than just that one.</p>

<blockquote>I also believe that columnists are entitled by their mandate to engage in the unfair use of statistics, the misleading representation of opposing positions, and the conscious withholding of contrary data. But because they’re entitled doesn’t mean I or you have to like it, or think it’s good for the newspaper. </p></blockquote>
<p>Really? Columnists are &#8220;entitled by their mandate&#8221; to mislead and deceive in the New York Times? Clearly, it&#8217;s not the role of the just departed public editor to, well, act in the interests of the body public and guard it from deception bearing the Times&#8217; imprimatur.(*) But shouldn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.nytco.com/company-executives-gcollins.html">the actual OP/Ed editor</a> care about such things?</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>(*) I&#8217;m not claiming that some editorial columnists don&#8217;t lie and deceive all the time in the Op/Ed pages. But until now I had figured that the editors were for the most part too lazy, and occasionally too stupid, to see what was slipping past them. Apparently, noble geniuses that they are, opinion editors (and public editors) are fully aware of the deceptions by those that they employ, but &#8212; alas and alack! &#8212; are powerless before the awesome power of writers entitled by their mandates.</p>

<blockquote><p>why did both Milton Friedman and Bob Solow scorn him as a macroeconomist?  Well, Fischer pushed two (actually more) controversial claims.  First, the Fed cannot influence real or nominal variables, unless traders allow it to &#8230; Black&#8217;s economic thought is centered around the view that all profit opportunities will be exploited.  So what happens if the central bank decides to add zeros to the accounts held at the Fed? &#8230; In Black&#8217;s view banks were already holding all the dollars they wished to.  One reaction is for banks to borrow less money at the discount window, or perhaps borrow less from each other.  Money will leave the system as quickly as it entered. </p></blockquote>
<p>Tyler links to a textbook discussion of the old-fashion money multiplier model and sides with Friedman.  I wish I could link to the old James Tobin lecture notes where he noted that this model presumed some sort of government imposed quantity restriction on the amount of money banks could supply.  Imagine if reserve requirements were repealed – or even lowered such that the money multiplier model would predict a constraint well about the market-clearing demand = supply of money level.  Black’s claim would then not be so controversial.</p>

                                <p>What did the Beatles mean by “I’m back in the USSR. You don’t know how lucky you are boys”?  And why is the Club for Growth crowd arguing we should emulate Russian economic policy as in this tribute from <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20050529-112428-1057r.htm">Stephen Moore</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>All over the world, from Estonia, to Albania, to Russia to Hong Kong, flat taxes are in vogue. The flat tax is being instituted to enhance economic growth, increase tax revenues and make tax codes fairer. Why not in the U.S. After all, isn&#8217;t the world topsy-turvy when Moscow, the onetime center of socialism, has a 13 percent top income tax rate compared to 35 percent in America, the land of the free? … I would suggest one politically viable way to overcome the special interest opposition to tax reform is adoption of a Freedom to Choose Flat Tax. The potential economic gains are gigantic for American workers and firms if the tax panel adopts this approach. For example, if the $200 billion a year compliance costs attributable to the tax code could be cut in half, the financial windfall to the nation would be larger than the value of all goods and services produced by every worker and business in the states of Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire combined. On top of that, Harvard University economist Dale Jorgenson estimated several years ago that if replacing the U.S. tax code with some kind of flat and simple consumption tax would increase economic growth by about 10 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before we turn to the real story in Russia, let me suggest two things.  #1: having a dual system of taxation would likely increase compliance costs and #2: Moore misrepresents what Jorgenson and other economists have said when he claims reducing tax rates encourage rapid economic growth.  The real message is that a fiscally neutral change in tax policy might provide a modest boost to savings assuming people consume less.  The Reagan-Bush43 fiscal agenda seems to be to “give people their money back” so they can consume more.  But even if the national savings rate is increased by a couple of percentage points, my Excel simulation model does not say that the growth rate rises by 10%.  Rather, real income eventually increases by about 9% in a new steady state that occurs in a couple of centuries with the immediate boost to the growth rate being only 0.2%.  Yet, Moore et al. continually misrepresent economic research by claiming a free lunch with a massive boost to the growth rate.  </p>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/russia-has-as-flat-tax-so-we-should.html">Mark Thoma</a> noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, let’s strive to emulate the economies of Estonia, Albania, and Russia &#8211; as the administration’s current economic policy seems to be doing &#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, the <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/rs.html">CIA</a> sees the Russian economic scene thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economic growth slowed down in the second half of 2004 and the Russian government forecasts growth of only 4.5% to 6.2% for 2005. Oil, natural gas, metals, and timber account for more than 80% of exports, leaving the country vulnerable to swings in world prices. Russia&#8217;s manufacturing base is dilapidated and must be replaced or modernized if the country is to achieve broad-based economic growth. Other problems include a weak banking system, a poor business climate that discourages both domestic and foreign investors, corruption, and widespread lack of trust in institutions. In addition, a string of investigations launched against a major Russian oil company, culminating with the arrest of its CEO in the fall of 2003, have raised concerns by some observers that President Putin is granting more influence to forces within his government that desire to reassert state control over the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>With per capita income less than $10,000 and 25% of the population in poverty, why is the Club for Growth crowd arguing that Russia is a shining example of supply-side economics.  It is true that real GDP growth was 5.1% in 2001, 4.7% in 2002, and 7.3% in 2003 but also note that real GDP grew by 6.3% in 1999 and 10% in 2000 before the reduction in income tax rates.  And despite the strong growth since 1998, real per capita income may still be below its levels when the Soviet Union fell.  If you are wondering why the Club for Growth blog discontinued comments, blame me for pointing out to Andrew Roth what Joseph Stiglitz wrote in his chapter “Who Lost Russia”.  It seems Andrew considers it to be sneaky liberalism to point out something written by a Nobel Prize winning economist.  </p>
<p>For sources on why Russia’s economy has seen such rapid growth since 1998, see the various reports from the <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/RUSSIANFEDERATIONEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20452311~menuPK:989684~pagePK:141137~piPK:217854~theSitePK:305600,00.html">World Bank</a>.  Their discussions note that Russia’s progress is attributable in part to restructurings that have undone some of the damage from the crony capitalism era and in part to rising petroleum prices, which is also discussed by <a href="http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=4276">Fiona Hill</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking carefully at Russia’s economic growth since 1997, there is a clear correlation between growth and the rise in world oil prices &#8230; In 1998, when world oil prices dipped to around $10 a barrel, this drop coincided with the worst of Russia’s economic crises and the collapse of the ruble. High oil prices and Russia’s oil production rebound after 1999 were good news for the Russian federal budget. Natural resources constitute around 80% of Russian exports and oil and gas account for 55% of all exports — making Russia’s budget particularly dependent on the energy sector. In fact, 37% of Russia’s budget revenues are provided by taxes on oil and gas. Recent research by the World Bank and the IMF has shown that each dollar increase in the price of a barrel of oil (Ural crude) raises Russia’s federal budget revenues by as much as 0.35% of GDP. </p></blockquote>
<p>To his credit, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/bartlett200503020824.asp">Bruce Bartlett</a> does not try to argue that the income tax change of 2001 increased economic growth and only notes an improvement in compliance as he points to an <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=17921.0">IMF analysis</a>, which states:</p>
<blockquote><p>there is no evidence of a strong supply side effect of the reform. Compliance, however, did improve quite substantially-by about one third according to our estimates-though it remains unclear whether this was due to the parametric reforms or to accompanying changes in enforcement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Check out the report in its entirety to see what evidence there might be for a supply-side compliance effect – and while you do so, look at table 3 on page 16, which shows income tax revenues were 3.4% of GDP in 2003 (as compared to 2.4% in 2000) with total tax revenues being 36.6% of GDP (as compared to 36.9% in 2000).  Imagine what a fiscally prudent liberal such as Alice Rivlin might do if total tax revenues (Federal, state, and local) were as high a percentage of U.S. GDP, that is, if we raised $4.4 trillion in taxes.  We could easily fund public schools, better health care, and have better roads and still pay down government debt so as to protect our Social Security retirement.  But Dr. Rivlin might also wonder if income tax revenues were a mere $0.4 trillion – how we would raise the other $4 trillion.  Is Mr. Moore proposing we increase other forms of taxation that much?</p>

                                <p>The Federal Reserve has been sounding the alarm: the housing market is on fire! </p>
<p>It started with <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050422/default.htm">Kohn 4/22/2005</a>.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Prices have gone up far enough since [a couple of years ago] relative to interest rates, rents, and incomes to raise questions; recent reports from professionals in the housing market suggest an increasing volume of transactions by investors, who (along with homeowners more generally) may be expecting the recent trend of price increases to continue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  Then Chairman <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/Speeches/2005/200505202/default.htm">Greenspan 5/20/2005</a> (in Q&#038;A):<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230; only those who have purchased very recently, purchased just before prices actually literally go down, are going to have problems.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> <a href="http://www.frbatlanta.org/invoke.cfm?objectid=144C6171-5056-9F06-9969F4E1D8B766F1&#038;method=display">Guynn 5/25/2005</a> (in Q&#038;A):<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Some buyers, some builders, some lenders are going to get burned &#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  And now <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050527/default.htm">Ferguson 5/27/2005</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230;right now, housing prices in many markets in the United States are relatively high when judged by conventional valuation measures&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  The comments from Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman Roger Ferguson are from his speech in Berlin titled “Asset Prices and Monetary Liquidity”.  In the speech Ferguson discussed possible links between “excess liquidity” and asset prices; both equities and housing.  With many cautions and caveats, Ferguson suggested that there was no obvious correlation between liquidity and equity prices, but that housing prices were somewhat correlated to <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/about.htm">M3</a> across many countries and periods.</p>
<p>Dr. Ferguson presented the following figure and discussion to show the historical relationship between housing prices and M3:<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/figure3a.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/figure3a.jpg"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The solid line in figure 3 shows the average behavior of the growth rate of M3 from twenty quarters before a peak in real house prices until twenty quarters after the peak, where the average is taken across all the cyclical episodes in our broad sample. The broken line in the chart is the log level of real house prices indexed to zero in the peak year. As can be seen from the chart, on average the growth rate of money increases fairly steadily until around two quarters before the peak in real house prices and then drops fairly steadily for ten quarters afterward before recovering somewhat. Although there are some variations, this pattern tends to occur in most countries&#8217; episodes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As a follow up to Dr. Ferguson&#8217;s speech, the following chart shows the real prices of housing nationwide since 1976.  This data is from the OFHEO home price index, a &#8220;constant quality&#8221; index that is based on repeat transactions of individual homes.  The nominal prices are adjusted with CPI less shelter.</p>

For a discussion of price declines in previous busts see &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/housing-after-boom.html">Housing: After the Boom</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>This clearly shows the nationwide real price declines for housing in the early &#8217;80s and early &#8217;90s.  In Ferguson&#8217;s speech, he presented a similar figure that included the early / mid-70&#8217;s housing bust (see <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050527/default.htm#figure2">figure 2</a>).</p>
<p>The following graph is of the price adjusted value of M3 for the same period.  The vertical lines indicate when housing peaked in the previous cycles.<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/M31.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/M31.jpg"></a></p>
<p>It is important to repeat Dr. Ferguson’s caution regarding not confusing correlation with causation, but it does appear that housing has peaked in the past when price adjusted M3 has peaked.  Price adjusted M3 appears to be peaking right now: April 2005 only saw a 1% increase YoY.</p>
<p>Here a couple of more comments from Ferguson.  On housing valuations:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;For housing, rent-to-price ratios and income-to-price ratios are commonly used measures to assess valuation. Over the past several years, both measures have decreased sharply in many countries, and they currently are well outside historical ranges in some countries.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  For an interesting discussion on this topic, see <a href="http://globblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/consider-this-your-memorial-daymay.html">General Glut&#8217;s post</a> today.</p>
<p>And finally, Ferguson expressed concern about the impact on the economy of a housing bust:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;In a scenario of collapse, the damage to balance sheets and private wealth could go as far as undermining the soundness of the financial system and threatening stability of the real economy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  The NY Times had an excellent article on this topic on Saturday: &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/29/business/yourmoney/29view.html">Hear a Pop? Watch Out</a>&#8220;.  I also discussed this topic earlier on Angry Bear: &#8220;After the Housing Boom: <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/after-housing-boom-impact-on-economy.html">Impact on the Economy</a>&#8220;. </p>
<p>Finally there were too many housing related articles this weekend to comment on them all.  As an example, did you know that <a href="http://www.ajc.com/business/content/business/0505/29mortgages.html">Georgia</a> leads the nation in Interest Only loans?  That was a surprise to me!  See <a href="http://patrick.net/housing/crash.html">Patrick’s links</a> for a list of recent housing related stories.</p>

                                <p>Is <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/wall___main;_ylt=Aqk4riMJgeDPgpKBRCJ8SN4DW7oF;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl">Meg Richards</a> confused as to the fundamentals of finance:</p>
<blockquote><p>With earnings growth on the decline, there&#8217;s renewed interest in what was once considered an old-fashioned investment. Dividends &#8211; regular payments to shareholders out of a company&#8217;s retained earnings &#8211; have long provided a boost to total return, and now analysts say they could help drive the stock market higher … Historically, dividends have played a much more important role than they currently do, accounting for about 4 percentage points of the roughly 10 percent average annual return stocks have delivered since 1926. But their popularity waned during the bull market … Why now, two years after the tax act was passed, are dividends taking the lead? It&#8217;s partly because earnings growth was so strong, it eclipsed the importance of the humble dividend</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/why-has-dividend-payout-ratio.html">Mark Thoma</a> tries to make sense of her article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why has the dividend payout ratio increased in recent years? According to the article below, there are several possible reasons: (1) Concerns about future returns. When investors expect the market rate of return to exceed the internal rate of return for the firm, they would prefer to have dividends paid out instead of reinvested internally. Thus, as investors anticipate lower rates of return in the future, they will shift towards firms offering dividends and away from firms that use profits for internal reinvestment. (2) The tax act of May 2003 made dividends relatively more attractive from a tax perspective. (3) A change in corporate compensation law has led to a restructuring towards compensation packages that rely more heavily on dividends. (4) There has been a recent shift by investors towards assets with less risk, and historically firms with both solid growth and yield characteristics have less risky overall returns.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark leads with the key issue of expected future earnings, which is why I raised the <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/02/krugmans-unhappy-returns.html">Samwick effect</a>, which we mentioned <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/mankiw-on-baker-delong-krugman-paper.html">here</a>.  Simply put – if expected future earnings growth is low, firms that wish to serve shareholder interest will increase the proportion of current earnings that are paid out to shareholders.  While Mark seems to have a shorter term perspective, the Baker-DeLong-Krugman paper that Mankiw commented upon by in part drawing on the Samwick effect (which is a corollary of the Miller &#038; Modigliani proposition) addressed the of slower long-term growth on asset values and returns.  If growth slows, the payout ratio increases but stock valuations decline.</p>
<p>Ms. Richards argues that stock valuations may increase – and her argument drifts from noting lower earnings growth to a suggestion that the market might be expecting higher short-term earnings growth.  It is not inconceivable that the market may expect higher future earnings, but in that case – wouldn’t the Samwick effect suggest a lower payout ratio?</p>
