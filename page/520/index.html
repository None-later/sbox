                                <p>by guest poster <a href="http://aguanomics.com/2008/11/fixing-credit-rating-agencies.html">David Zetland of Aguanomics</a></p>
<p>Fixing Credit Rating Agencies</p>
<p>And now for something completely different&#8230;</p>
<p>I read yet another story on how the credit rating agencies (Standard and Poors, Moodys, Fitch, et al.) failed at their task of rating credit instruments (bonds, derivatives, etc.) to reflect the risk of those instruments.</p>
<p>The credit rating business works like this: Companies that want to issue instruments pay the agencies to rate them (AAA, BBb, etc.) for risk. The companies then sell instruments on the market to buyers who look at the rating when deciding how much to pay. The higher the rating, the higher the price that the companies will get, and the less risk the buyers think they are taking on.</p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s a clear conflict of interest: Companies paying agencies want a high rating, agencies have an incentive to give high ratings (in exchange for bigger fees, more future business, etc.), but buyers depend on agency ratings.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, buyers cannot pay the agencies. They cannot pay in advance (they are not sure they will buy until AFTER ratings are done), and &#8212; even if they did &#8212; they would suffer from free-riding (if some buyers pay for the rating, other buyers can use that information without paying).</p>
<p>So, how do we fix the system (improving accuracy) while maintaining the current payment relationships? Change incentives in this way:</p>
<p>   1. Set a standard fee for rating that depends on the type of instrument, the size of the issue, etc. Such standardization would remove one obvious problem (negotiated fees) while giving agencies an incentive to turn down business that&#8217;s too complicated to understand.<br />   2. Track the performance of all instruments rated by an agency in a given credit category (e.g., AA-) against all others in that category. Those that underperformed (price fell below the average) are probably riskier than the initial rating indicated, i.e., the agency was overoptimistic. Performance ratings should be weighted by the age of the instrument/rating, the size of the issue, etc.<br />   3. Adjust each agency&#8217;s fees to equal some fraction of the standard fee based on that agency&#8217;s performance relative to other agencies, e.g., 80% if ratings are too high (missing hidden risk) or 110% if the ratings are too low (seeing non-existing risk). </p>
<p>Under this system, buyers could observe how accurate agencies are, and companies would have an explicit notion that they are paying for a rating of an agency that&#8217;s often too optimistic/pessimistic, etc.</p>
<p>Note that this system depends on competition, so it&#8217;s important to avoid cartels, oligopoly, etc. Even if standard prices are &#8220;set&#8221; (good place for a regulator), the competition will take place ex-post, when markets &#8220;reveal&#8221; the quality of the agencies&#8217; work.</p>
<p>Also note that #2 alone could do quite a lot to improve matters, but it&#8217;s nice to link income to performance (#1 and #3).</p>
<p>Bottom Line: We need credit ratings, but we need to punish rating agencies that do a bad job, and the market is the best place for punishment. <br />___________________________<br />by guest David Zetland</p>

<p>Fuel and the Free Market: Why Is Brazil Ahead of the US When it Comes to Cars that Run on Something Other than Gasoline?</p>
<p>In the last year or so, before the price of oil dropped, there was a bit of interest in finding ways to reduce our dependence on oil, and on &#8220;alternative fuels&#8221; and sources of energy.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the interesting thing &#8211; in Brazil, today, if you feel like it you can buy a vehicle from any of the major manufacturers that is tri-flex.  That is, your vehicle will run on gasoline, ethanol, or natural gas.  When you&#8217;re running low on fuel, you figure out which gives you more miles to the <strike>buck</strike> real on that day and that location and fill up on whatever is cheapest.  The same car will run on any of the three fuels, and on pretty much any mix of gasoline and ethanol.  </p>
<p>As an aside &#8211; ethanol in Brazil is a real, viable option, unlike the hoax that&#8217;s perpetrated on the American public.  Ethanol in Brazil comes from sugar cane, which grows like a weed at the side of road in many places and contains a lot of sugar, which is what you need to make alcohol.  Furthermore, what else are you going to do with sugar cane, if not make sugar and/or alcohol?  Put another way &#8211; if there&#8217;s anything sugar cane isn&#8217;t like, its, well, corn.</p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering &#8211; how come the Brazilians have tri-flex fuel cars?  Why will GM and Ford and Volkswagen sell those vehicles in Brazil but not in the US?  Wouldn&#8217;t having such vehicles help reduce our dependence on oil?  Heck, forget even about gasoline and ethanol &#8211; the US and Canada are among the largest producers of natural gas in the world, and as a result, the price of natural gas is lower in the US than most places in the world.  Why don&#8217;t we even see vehicles running on natural gas, other than the odd city bus or garbage truck in random municipalities?</p>
<p>The answer is a simple but unpleasant one.  See, we in the US would label the way that Brazil got to that point by an epithet:  socialism.  It makes no sense to label it socialism &#8211; the policies that today allow Brazilians to purchase vehicles with technology you won&#8217;t see in the US for at least a decade, and probably a lot longer, have their origin with Brazil&#8217;s military dictatorship, which could better be described as fascist than socialist.</p>
<p>Around the time of the oil embargo, countries around the world looked at ways to reduce their dependence on Middle Eastern oil.  Brazil was no different, and it cast its eyes on alcohol.  I believe the government went so far as to decree that by a certain date, some percentage of new vehicles sold had to run on alcohol.  (Back then it was either alcohol or gasoline &#8211; the technology wasn&#8217;t there to allow you randomly mix the two fuels in the same gas tank like they do today.)</p>
<p>But&#8230; and here&#8217;s the key question &#8211; even if alcohol is cheap and plentiful in Brazil, how do you get Brazilians to buy cars that run on alcohol when there are no service stations selling alcohol?  (Put another way &#8211; even though natural gas is cheap and plentiful in the US, how do you get Americans to buy cars that run on natural gas when there are no service stations selling natural gas?)  In Brazil, the answer is simple:  ensure that there are service stations selling natural alcohol.  (In the US the answer is even simpler:  you don&#8217;t.) The usual suspects at the time (Exxon, Texaco, Shell) ran gasoline stations in Brazil at the time.  But so did Petrobras, the giant Brazilian oil company.  But Petrobras was state owned at the time, so the government could simply decide to have it sell alcohol as well.  And it did.   As I recall (I was living there at the time) &#8211; it was some time in the late 70s or early 80s. </p>
<p>In any case, when it comes to fueling up one&#8217;s car, Brazilians have choices.    They&#8217;ve had choices for decades.  And nowadays, they have even more.  Americans have no such choices.  I imagine the free market will eventually provide a solution in the US.  Maybe.  But its clear that sometimes the free market, left to its devices, provides fewer and worse choices &#8211; i.e., provides less of a free market &#8211; than what we here in the US like to call &#8220;socialism.&#8221; <br />__________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>Physician Foundation Report 11/18/08<br />The Physicians’ Foundation was founded in 2003 with settlement funds from a major lawsuit against Aetna (long story). <a href="http://www.physiciansfoundations.org/">Physicians Foundations</a></p>
<p>The PF issued a report this morning after reviewing 12,000 survey responses from practicing physicians.</p>
<p>The conclusions about medicine in general and primary care in particular in the U.S. are very grim.</p>
<p> Many physicians plan to retire early</p>
<p> Many physicians are looking for non-clinical jobs.</p>
<p> Many physicians plan to cut back on patient loads.</p>
<p> There is too much paperwork.</p>
<p> Some physicians want to cut back to part-time.</p>
<p>(There is another topic lurking here, but it is very sensitive, and will be covered in another post).  See <a href="http://healthcarethinktank.blogspot.com/2008/11/physician-foundation-report-111808.html">Health Care Think Tank</a></p>

                                <p>Was the Great Depression really THE Great One? Apparently not, according to <a href="http://chronicle.com/temp/reprint.php?id=477k3d8mh2wmtpc4b6h07p4hy9z83x18">Scott Reynolds Neslon</a>, 19th century historian. The Real Great Depression was the Panic of 1873 [fixed]. The parallels to present day, he says, are unnerving and uncanny. I include practically the entire piece. It is well worth the read.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>That crash came in 1873 and lasted more than four years. It looks much more like our current crisis. </p>
<p>The problems had emerged around 1870, starting in Europe. In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, formed in 1867, in the states unified by Prussia into the German empire, and in France, the emperors supported a flowering of new lending institutions that issued mortgages for municipal and residential construction, especially in the capitals of Vienna, Berlin, and Paris. Mortgages were easier to obtain than before, and a building boom commenced. <em><strong>Land values seemed to climb and climb; borrowers ravenously assumed more and more credit</strong></em>, using unbuilt or half-built houses as collateral. The most marvelous spots for sightseers in the three cities today are the magisterial buildings erected in the so-called founder period.<br />But the economic fundamentals were shaky. <strong><em>Wheat exporters from Russia and Central Europe faced a new international competitor who drastically undersold them. The 19th-century version of containers manufactured in China and bound for Wal-Mart consisted of produce from farmers in the American Midwest</em></strong>. They used grain elevators, conveyer belts, and massive steam ships to export trainloads of wheat to abroad. Britain, the biggest importer of wheat, shifted to the cheap stuff quite suddenly around 1871. By 1872 kerosene and manufactured food were rocketing out of America&#8217;s heartland, undermining rapeseed, flour, and beef prices. The crash came in Central Europe in May 1873, as it became clear that the region&#8217;s assumptions about continual economic growth were too optimistic. Europeans faced what they came to call the American Commercial Invasion. A new industrial superpower had arrived, one whose low costs threatened European trade and a European way of life.<br /><strong><em>As continental banks tumbled, British banks held back their capital, unsure of which institutions were most involved in the mortgage crisis</em></strong>. The cost to borrow money from another bank — the interbank lending rate — reached impossibly high rates. This banking crisis hit the United States in the fall of 1873. Railroad companies tumbled first. They had crafted complex financial instruments that promised a fixed return, though few understood the underlying object that was guaranteed to investors in case of default. (Answer: nothing). The bonds had sold well at first, but they had tumbled after 1871 as investors began to doubt their value, prices weakened, and many railroads took on short-term bank loans to continue laying track. Then, as short-term lending rates skyrocketed across the Atlantic in 1873, the railroads were in trouble. When the railroad financier Jay Cooke proved unable to pay off his debts, the stock market crashed in September, closing hundreds of banks over the next three years. The panic continued for more than four years in the United States and for nearly six years in Europe. </p>
<p>The long-term effects of the Panic of 1873 were perverse. For the largest manufacturing companies in the United States — those with guaranteed contracts and the ability to make rebate deals with the railroads — the Panic years were golden. Andrew Carnegie, Cyrus McCormick, and John D. Rockefeller had enough capital reserves to finance their own continuing growth. For smaller industrial firms that relied on seasonal demand and outside capital, the situation was dire. As capital reserves dried up, so did their industries. Carnegie and Rockefeller bought out their competitors at fire-sale prices. The Gilded Age in the United States, as far as industrial concentration was concerned, had begun. </p>
<p>As the panic deepened, ordinary Americans suffered terribly. A cigar maker named Samuel Gompers who was young in 1873 later recalled that with the panic, &#8220;economic organization crumbled with some primeval upheaval.&#8221; Between 1873 and 1877, as many smaller factories and workshops shuttered their doors, tens of thousands of workers — many former Civil War soldiers — became transients. The terms &#8220;tramp&#8221; and &#8220;bum,&#8221; both indirect references to former soldiers, became commonplace American terms. Relief rolls exploded in major cities, with 25-percent unemployment (100,000 workers) in New York City alone. Unemployed workers demonstrated in Boston, Chicago, and New York in the winter of 1873-74 demanding public work. In New York&#8217;s Tompkins Square in 1874, police entered the crowd with clubs and beat up thousands of men and women. The most violent strikes in American history followed the panic, including by the secret labor group known as the Molly Maguires in Pennsylvania&#8217;s coal fields in 1875, when masked workmen exchanged gunfire with the &#8220;Coal and Iron Police,&#8221; a private force commissioned by the state. A nationwide railroad strike followed in 1877, in which mobs destroyed railway hubs in Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Cumberland, Md. </p>
<p>In Central and Eastern Europe, times were even harder. Many political analysts blamed the crisis on a combination of foreign banks and Jews. Nationalistic political leaders (or agents of the Russian czar) embraced a new, sophisticated brand of anti-Semitism that proved appealing to thousands who had lost their livelihoods in the panic. Anti-Jewish pogroms followed in the 1880s, particularly in Russia and Ukraine. Heartland communities large and small had found a scapegoat: aliens in their own midst. </p>
<p>The echoes of the past in the current problems with residential mortgages trouble me. Loans after about 2001 were issued to first-time homebuyers who signed up for adjustablerate mortgages they could likely never pay off, even in the best of times. Real-estate speculators, hoping to flip properties, overextended themselves, assuming that home prices would keep climbing. Those debts were wrapped in complex securities that mortgage companies and other entrepreneurial banks then sold to other banks; concerned about the stability of those securities, banks then bought a kind of insurance policy called a credit-derivative swap, which risk managers imagined would protect their investments. More than two million foreclosure filings — default notices, auction-sale notices, and bank repossessions — were reported in 2007. By then trillions of dollars were already invested in this credit-derivative market. Were those new financial instruments resilient enough to cover all the risk? (Answer: no.) As in 1873, a complex financial pyramid rested on a pinhead. Banks are hoarding cash. Banks that hoard cash do not make short-term loans. Businesses large and small now face a potential dearth of short-term credit to buy raw materials, ship their products, and keep goods on shelves.<br />If there are lessons from 1873, they are different from those of 1929. Most important, when banks fall on Wall Street, they stop all the traffic on Main Street — for a very long time. The protracted reconstruction of banks in the United States and Europe created widespread unemployment. Unions (previously illegal in much of the world) flourished but were then destroyed by corporate institutions that learned to operate on the edge of the law. In Europe, politicians found their scapegoats in Jews, on the fringes of the economy. (Americans, on the other hand, mostly blamed themselves; many began to embrace what would later be called fundamentalist religion.) </p>
<p>The post-panic winners, even after the bailout, might be those firms — financial and otherwise — that have substantial cash reserves. A widespread consolidation of industries may be on the horizon, along with a nationalistic response of high tariff barriers, a decline in international trade, and scapegoating of immigrant competitors for scarce jobs. The failure in July of the World Trade Organization talks begun in Doha seven years ago suggests a new wave of protectionism may be on the way.</p>

<p>With GM being the bigger of the three bullies vying for our monetary attention what are your guy’s thoughts about what to actually do with GM if it does enter bankruptcy?</p>
<p>I’m guessing since it’s even being tossed out there when only 3 months ago (??) Wagoner was insisting bankruptcy was not even an option on the table.  Sure sounds like the winds of change have blown that one into the room here lately…and now they’re saying it’s their only option if they don’t get the money?!</p>
<p>So, if GM enters bankruptcy, I kinda like my idea of making “General Motors” a designer &#038; builder of chassis and underlying bits to then sell to their former subdivisions.</p>
<p>GM can also offer contract building &#038; assembly services to these companies – for a price obviously.</p>
<p>Spin off all of them and let’s see whether “survival” (of the fittest?) is something that can be done in the auto industry. </p>
<p>I’m sure you’ll have a bit of consolidation though how much is difficult to predict but I imagine it would be a while (5-10 years?) especially since they (the former subsidiaries) couldn’t cost-effectively jump from the GM ship too soon.</p>
<p>Remember, it takes years to design a car the buying public wants – and they have to be able to predict the future too!  *puke* </p>
<p>And with them standing as their own entities you could effectively let the market decide what they’re worth overall and whether they’re even worth saving ultimately.</p>
<p>The US Governement:</p>
<p>Big problem, meet C-4 *boom*</p>
<p>Now, all you little “problems” need to decide how you’re to survive on your own.</p>
<p>And if you feel like going under it’s not something we forced you to do.</p>
<p>But if you come back to us for money, you (should be) are now a much more manageable issue.</p>
<p>It buys “us” time and does what the GOP loves to crow about when it works ‘right’ – the free market will decide.</p>
<p>Possible GM structure:</p>
<p>All brands separated from the parent conglomerate (Chevrolet, Pontiac, Cadillac, GMC, Hummer, Holden, Open, Vauxhaul, Daewoo, Breckland – anything else I missed?).</p>
<p>These separations incorporate the design studios, dealership sales contracts (for those individual brands only) &#038; repairs.  They can strike out on their own for tooling and manufacturing but there will be great incentives to contract with the former parent. </p>
<p>GM then becomes a tooling creator, manufacturer, chassis &#038; parts supplier to the now free-standing brands.  Each brand can use (or not) the GM Platforms™ as the basis for their vehicles which are designed and customized by their own in-house designers with GM providing the know-how to build and assemble the parts. </p>
<p>You’ve effectively made the auto industry into a carbon copy of the PC industry!  There is an underlying set of features &#038; capabilities (the “chassis” offered by AMD or Intel) that incorporates various alternate components (Seagate or Hitachi hard drive?  NVidia or ATI video card?  Similar to whether you get the leather or cloth interior…) depending upon what brand (HP, IBM, Dell, Sony – a la Pontiac or Opel) you ultimately buy.</p>
<p>It’s not only been successful for the past 20+ years (the PC industry) but there’s been intense competition within the industry as a whole for the various features offered by all participants. </p>
<p>Do you want a cheap but functional PC for e-mail only?  Then an all-in-one product from AMD is your choice. </p>
<p>Like to play games?  Then you’re looking at the highest-performing chip from Intel or AMD coupled with the highest-performing video card from NVidia or ATI.</p>
<p>Why couldn’t the auto industry operate in the same fashion?  Maybe my glasses are a bit too rose colored…<br />__________________________________<br />by reader tinman</p>

                                <p>reader Howard Covitz says:</p>
<p>If the U.S. auto industry wants a bailout, let us respond by offering to foot their health care bills. The U.S. auto industry is at a comparative disadvantage to foreign auto companies because they pay for part of employee (including retired employee) health insurance. This dollar figure has grown far faster than inflation for over a decade. If the U.S. government offered to include all auto industry employees in its government employee health care pool (this is Obama&#8217;s plan for national health care), it would not only take a huge weight off of Detroit&#8217;s shoulders, but also benefit the US by serving as a proof-of-concept for national health care. The success of the plan will take a lot of wind out of the sails of the anti-national healthcare lobbying groups (who derailed Hillary&#8217;s proposal in 1993).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a win-win idea!</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SSPrkNmENhI/AAAAAAAAAaQ/xVmzWQB6h8E/s1600-h/19ports_600.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SSPrkNmENhI/AAAAAAAAAaQ/xVmzWQB6h8E/s320/19ports_600.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/business/economy/19ports.html?_r=1">But these are not ordinary times</a>. (NYT)</p>
<p>
<blockquote>For now, the port itself is the destination. Unwelcome by dealers and buyers, thousands of cars worth tens of millions of dollars are being warehoused on increasingly crowded port property.</p>
<p>And for the first time, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, and Nissan have each asked to lease space from the port for these orphan vehicles. They are turning dozens of acres of the nation’s second-largest container port into a parking lot, creating a vivid picture of a paralyzed auto business and an economy in peril.</p>
<p>“This is one way to look at the economy,” Art Wong, a spokesman for the port, said of the cars. “And it scares you to death.”</p>
<p>The backlog at the port is just part of a broader rise in the nation’s inventories, which were up 5.5 percent in September from a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department. The car industry has been hurt particularly, with sales down nearly 15 percent this year. General Motors has said it would run out of operating cash by the end of the year if it does not receive a government bailout.</p>
<p>But the inventory glut in Long Beach is not limited to imported cars. There has also been a sharp drop in demand for the port’s single largest export: recycled cardboard and paper products.</p>
<p>This material typically goes to China, where it is used to make boxes for new electronics and other products that are sent back to the United States. But Chinese factories reacting to sharply falling demand are slowing production, so they need less cardboard. Tons of paper are piling up recycling businesses around the port, the detritus of economies on hold.</p>
<p>Long Beach is an important port, particularly for the West. It is where imported products arrive and filter through the tributary of trucks, trains and retailers into the hands of consumers. But now, products are just sitting.</p>
<p>“We’re supposed to move things, not store them,” Mr. Wong said.</p>
<p>Roughly 20 percent of the nation’s container imports last year came through Long Beach, putting it close behind the largest container port, Los Angeles. This year, shipping volume at Long Beach is down 10 percent from 2007, and nearly all major ports around the country have seen similar declines. Veteran port workers say the slowdown since mid-October is like nothing they have ever seen. And it is having a cascading impact on other businesses and workers.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote> Security researchers, anti-spam groups and the whole security community in general were taken by surprise yesterday when reports of a sudden drop in junk mail activity started flowing in. This was the result of ISPs depeering McColo Corp., a U.S. based company offering web hosting services to many international cybercrime organizations.</p></blockquote>
<p>First, there was the gathering of evidence:<br />
<blockquote> McColo Corp. is based in San Jose, California and offers web hosting solutions. Nothing bad so far, but according to many reports and an important amount of evidence, a large number of their clients are shady at best. Security experts estimate that the spam generated by the illegal activities hosted by McColo amounts for a whooping 75% of the junk mail sent everyday on a global level.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then it was presented to the companies that could do something about it.<br />
<blockquote>Brian Krebs, reputable journalist at The Washington Post, informed on the <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/11/major_source_of_online_scams_a.html">Security Fix blog</a> that he was involved with forwarding evidence of the criminal activity to Global Crossing and Hurricane Electric, McColo&#8217;s two major Internet service providers. “For the past four months, Security Fix has been gathering data from the security industry about McColo Corp. [&#8230;] On Monday, Security Fix contacted the Internet providers that manage more than 90 percent of the company&#8217;s connection to the larger Internet, sending them information about badness at McColo as documented by the security industry,” he writes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then it was left to two companies to examine the evidence. Compare and contrast:<br />
<blockquote>According to Krebs, while the response from Global Crossing was rather evasive, Hurricane Electric was a lot more responsive to the abuse report and even quick to act about it. &#8220;We looked into it a bit, saw the size and scope of the problem you were reporting and said &#8216;Holy cow! Within the hour we had terminated all of our connections to them,&#8221; Benny Ng, the Freemont-based ISP&#8217;s Director of Marketing, told Krebs.</p></blockquote>
