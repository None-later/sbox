<blockquote>Instead of a nationwide government insurance program, [House Majority Whip Jim]  Clyburn is urging other Democrats to accept a scaled-down public option that would be tested as a pilot program in several parts of the country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s it !  I have a proposal.  Tell reluctant senators and representatives that, if they think their constituents don&#8217;t want any public insurance except for medicare and medicaid, then they can refuse to have it.  The rule is the public option is not available in a state if both senators say no to the public option and for other states it is not available in a congressional district of the representative says no.</p>
<p>As with governors refusing stimulus spending, I predict there will be few takers.  Senators and representatives will not be enthusiastic to choose higher premia for their constituents.  </p>
<p>So they will be in the position of saying it&#8217;s evil and horrible and my constituents have to have it.  </p>
<p>Some ideologues will say no to the public option for their constituents, but then how can they claim the authority to decide what people in other states or districts can buy.  Also in a year or so their constituents will be pissed as hell.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/?p=4454" target="_blank">Elizabeth Warren</a> of the Congressional Oversight Committee for TARP, and champion of an active voice for consumer protection regulation, offers her thoughts in <i>Real Change: Turning up the heat on non-bank lenders </i>with one of her latest essays at <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/" target="_blank">New Deal 2.0</a>, part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://rooseveltinstitution.org/">Roosevelt Institution</a>.</p>
<p>We have watched regulation slip away, which is of course not always bad, through terminating good rules, decreased funding to an agency to make enforcement less of an issue, and leadership in an agency to change the intent of regulatory function. </p>
<blockquote><p>The big banks are storming Washington, determined to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPA). They understand that a regulator who actually cares about consumers would cause a seismic change in their business model: No more burying the terms of the agreement in the fine print, no more tricks and traps. If the big banks lose the protection of their friendly regulators, the business model that produces hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue — and monopoly-size profits that exist only in non-competitive markets — will be at risk. That’s a big change.</p>
<p>But there is an even bigger change in the wind: regulating the non-banks. Democrats and Republicans alike agree that the proliferation of unregulated, non-bank lenders contributed significantly to the financial crisis by feeding millions of dangerous financial products into the economic system. Non-bank institutions were active participants in the race to the bottom among lenders. From subprime mortgage loans to small dollar loans, they showed how to wring high fees and staggering interest rates out of consumer lending. Their fine-print contracts, and new tricks and traps, transformed the market.</p>
<p>Despite widespread agreement about the problem, the U.S. has never made a sustained, systemic effort to regulate non-bank lenders&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8230;As lending abuses became more obvious, there was no effort to close regulatory gaps and loopholes or to devote federal resources toward the oversight of non-bank institutions. The reasons are many, but one of the most benign explanations is that policymakers for too long assumed that states could deal with the non-banks because the non-bank lenders are often small and often operate locally (although Countrywide showed that state-based organizations can metastasize rapidly). As it turns out, the states actually faced several limitations in reining in these lenders.</p>
<p>States, just like the federal government, were subject to intense lobbying by creditors. In short order, many states changed their rules to undercut basic protections. For example, the consumer finance industry succeeded in rewriting state interest rate regulation to allow for massive increases in allowable effective rates — even when the advertised rate looks far lower and obscures the true cost of credit. In many states, making an end run around local usury laws is now as easy as running around a single fencepost. At the same time, state legislatures face the perpetual lag-behind problem. They are unable to adjust to a rapidly changing financial services market, too slow to identify problems and not capable of changing the laws quickly enough to head off serious problems.</p>
<p>Moreover, resources are always constrained at the state level, and the enforcement of consumer credit laws competes with a wide variety of other state obligations. When consumer credit laws were violated, states often lacked the capacity to undertake serious investigations or to prosecute offenders. Some states made heroic efforts, but others left consumer financial issues far down their priority list.</p>
<p>The problem of enforcement has been exacerbated by a serious structural problem. When an abuse surfaced-for example, a local paper ran a news story about an unfair practice or a consumer group assembled evidence of sharp practices-local officials often responded by jumping on small banks. The non-banks were often scattered and difficult to find, while the biggest financial institutions were typically protected from local prosecution through pre-emption. That left the small banks holding the bag. These small banks, often those with state charters, were the easiest institutions to locate and the cheapest to prosecute — even if they were only tangentially involved in deceptive practices. The result was that the worst offenders slipped away. Non-banks could shut down for a while, and then reappear when the heat was off. In effect, the state enforcement structure benefitted the big banks and the non-banks.</p>
<p>The CFPA presents the first real opportunity to change that harmful structure.</p>
<p>First, the CFPA will regulate consumer financial products across the board-using the same rules for all mortgages or for all small dollar loans, regardless of whether the mortgage or the loan is issued by a national bank, a state bank or a non-bank. The old practice of different sets of rules and different regulatory structures for the same products would disappear. Instead, the CFPA would create a coordinated set of baseline rules applicable across the board.</p>
<p>Consolidated rule-making will also stop the practice of lenders shopping around for the regulator with the weakest rules. Bank holding companies have enjoyed an enormous advantage by having the freedom to structure their many business divisions to exploit regulatory weakness. They can operate a federally chartered bank when preemption is valuable to them. At the same time, they can purchase the products of non-banks in bulk, creating informal partnerships that exploit gaps in the state regulatory system. In fact, the Center for Public Integrity found that 21 of the 25 largest subprime issuers leading up to the crisis were financed by large banks. (Remember this the next time you hear a lobbyist blaming the crisis on non-banks and denying the role of the bank holding companies.) With consistent rules across the board, the CFPA would put an end to these practices.</p>
<p>Consistent rules are important, but, as we now know, it isn’t enough to have good rules on the books. There must also be a serious effort to enforce those rules. With the right sources of funding and some smart strategic thinking about how to force non-banks to follow the same rules as other lenders, the entire landscape of consumer lending would change.</p>
<p>From history, we have learned that an agency’s source of funding is critical to its success. By allowing the Agency to tax lenders directly — perhaps a dime for every open credit card account, a quarter for every open mortgage, etc. — Congress can make sure that the CFPA stays well-funded in the years ahead. The right funding structure will allow the Agency to develop the capacity to go after the non-banks and the dangerous products they originate, and it will insulate the Agency from political efforts to starve-the-regulators into inaction. Moreover, as we now know, the cost of even a well-funded agency is dwarfed by the cost to the government and the economy as a whole of bank failures. The cost of the failure of just one thrift – IndyMac — was almost ten times the annual budget of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>New forms of strategic thinking will also be needed. By creating a system for mandatory lender registration, for example, CFPA will be able to keep track of the consumer lenders out there — something that no current regulators have the tools to do. To encourage compliance, the CFPA can work with other federal agencies — like the Treasury Department or the Internal Revenue Service — to identify unregistered lenders. In states that already register certain non-bank lenders, the CFPA can work off those registrations and collaborate with state officials. This is tough work, but a consumer agency with expertise and resources will rise to the challenge.</p>
<p>The CFPA can also get smarter with enforcement by exploiting concentration points, places where small players are effectively grouped together. In the case of mortgage brokers, for example, without the large bank holding companies and their subsidiaries as customers for the loans they place, many would be out of business. Focusing regulatory attention on the buyers would create substantial leverage over the brokers as well. If the sponsors and funding mechanisms for the worst practices go away, so will the worst practices.</p>
<p>There is more that we can do to deal with non-bank lenders, but only if Congress creates a strong CFPA. If we stick with the status quo — which treats loans differently depending on who issues them and places consumer protection in agencies that consider it an afterthought &#8211; we know what will happen because we have seen it happen before. Lenders will continue their tricks and traps business model, the mega-banks will exploit regulatory loopholes, and the non-banks will continue to sell deceptive products. In that world, small banks will need to choose between lowering standards or losing market share, and they will still get too much attention from regulators while the non-banks and big banks get too little. Dangerous loans will destabilize both families and the economy, and we’ll all remain at risk for the next trillion-dollar bailout.</p>
<p>Regulating the non-banks hasn’t been tried in any serious way. The CFPA offers a real chance to level the playing field, to add balance to the system, and to change the consumer lending landscape forever.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

<p>finds himself more than usually ignorant about a topic which interests him (hard as that is to believe).</p>
<p>Medicare has a budget shortfall of present value of a whole whole lotta dough. This tends to make people worry, and makes many believe that benefits will be cut by the health care reform bills. There are no such cuts in the bills on the floor of the House or Senate. However, many people who know this seem convinced by Republican hints that reform will lead to medicare cuts. The logic is that if the Federal Government accepts responsibility to guarantee health insurance to people under 65 it will have to cut medicare to remain solvent.</p>
<p>Now back to that shortfall. It can be recalculated assuming say the House Ways and Means committee bill passes. It seems to me that it will be much smaller. There are cuts of medicare expenditures &#8212; less extra spending for medicare advantage and lower transfers to hospitals for care of the uninsured. As far as I can tell, there are no cuts to medicare administration revenues. The spending increases for subsidies and medicaid expansion will be financed with another tax (in the bill in question a tax on high incomes). </p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t that mean that the bill will cut the medicare shortfall ? I mean by something like half a trillion (update: to be clear, as in all discussions of dollars and health care reform, this refers spending over the ten years not annual spending, note comment by guest) and growing discounted with whatever the hell interest rate they use which works out to maybe a half lotta dough or a quarter lotta dough but in any case a less horrible looking shortfall and less pressure for cuts in medicare benefits.</p>
<p>Am I confused ? Anyone ? Bueller ? OK Bueller is playing hooky, how about Bruce ? Help me out here. I need it.</p>
<p>update: Grammer corrected and referent for half a trillion clarified.  The actual score for the Ways and Means/education and labor bill in the House is <a href="http://edlabor.house.gov/newsroom/2009/07/cbo-scores-confirms-deficit-ne.shtml">Medicare and Medicaid savings of $465 billion</a> over then next 10 years.  Medicare savings alone (over 10 years) are therefore well under $ 500 billion.  Ooops I missed the &#8220;and medicaid&#8221; part.</p>
<p>Note also that the estimated medicare shortfall is huge because the present value of spending is (current annual spending)/(i-g) where i is the interest rate and g is the rate of growth of nominal spending.  Since plausible estimates of g are close to i that means the denominator is real small.  I have no idea what g is used in the calculation of $ 465 billion over ten years or what i and g are used in the calculation of the  shortfall.  Hence the bleg.</p>
<p>update 2: I think that I will not be able to find out what fraction of money paid to hospitals to compensate for care of the uninsured comes from medicare and what fraction from medicaid.  It is not a huge amount of money compared to the cost of medicare advantage.  The best I can do is from the <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/AcuteInpatientPPS/downloads/FAQ_Uninsured.pdf">horses mouth (warning pdf)</a></p>
<blockquote><p>CMS makes payments &#8211; significant payments &#8211; to hospitals which treat a large number of poor and uninsured patients.  For example, the Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share provisions paid $22 billion to hospitals last year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Medicare funding is very complicated.  Medicare does *not* rely on the Medicare payroll tax.  There are huge transfers from the general fund to Medicare.  <a href="http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7305-04-2.pdf">Here is another pdf.</a></p>

<p>The employment report was discouraging.</p>
<p>In contrast to last month when the leading indicators of employment appeared to be stabilizing,<br />they resumed their downtrend this month.  Most importantly, hours worked fell o.3% from an upward revised 99.2 to 98.9.  the best that can be said about this now is that the rate of decline is about half of what it was in the prior three quarters. If productivity remains as strong as it was last quarter this implies that third quarter real GDP growth should be positive.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SqESSAAo_cI/AAAAAAAAA20/ZDVpznDXMNA/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SqESSAAo_cI/AAAAAAAAA20/ZDVpznDXMNA/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Virtually the only sign of good news is that the sharp slowing of average hourly earnings appears to be moderating. But generally wages are even more of a lagging indicator that employment, so<br />this apparent moderation in weak wages may not be sustainable.</p>

This implies that the reported rise in nominal personal income  reported in July should be repeated in August..</p>

                                <p>Rebecca</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s investigate these pre-BLS reports.</p>
<p>There are many job reports out there, but here are some of the biggies that come out right before the official government <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.toc.htm">BLS employment situation</a><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.toc.htm"></a> (not a coincidence).
<ul>
<li><a href="http://about-monster.com/employment/index/15">Monster</a><a href="http://about-monster.com/employment/index/15"> Employment Index </a>(not seasonally adjusted) – an index geared toward online recruiting trends.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/job-cut-announcements-off-in-july-challenger-gray-2009-09-02">Challenger job cuts</a> (not seasonally adjusted) – follows announced layoffs at large companies.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.adpemploymentreport.com/">ADP report</a> (seasonally adjusted) – estimates private nonfarm payroll using their payroll data (very different from the BLS survey methodology).</li>
<li><a href="http://hdi.wantedanalytics.com/2009/08/24/forecast-august-2009-%E2%80%94-total-nonfarm-payroll-down-190000/">WANTED</a> Technologies report (no information on seasonal adjustments on the website, but it must be, right?) – estimates total nonfarm payroll (private plus public) using “hiring demand data” stemming from online job boards.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SqA_2IxGpTI/AAAAAAAACeU/zKTgNlKjcfI/s1600-h/labor_chart.PNG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SqA_2IxGpTI/AAAAAAAACeU/zKTgNlKjcfI/s320/labor_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>Well, they are all generally trending in the positive direction – i.e., the “it’s getting worse less quickly” story. This is consistent with the BLS report. The trend is about all that they can match, the level value seems more like a hit or miss to me. (Note: except for the Challenger cuts, all of this data has been revised). Correction: Just heard from Charles Thibault over at WANTED &#8211; he says: &#8220;We do not &#8216;revise&#8217; forecasts ex-post like ADP&#8221;. Will update if that changes. RW: Maybe there&#8217;s something to this one.</p>
<p>But I am a skeptical as to the exact value added from these reports. Although the ADP report does not explicitly claim this, I imagine that they do like the idea that markets generally use their number as an indicator of the upcoming BLS report on Friday.</p>
<p>WANTED Technologies <a href="http://hdi.wantedanalytics.com/monthly-bls-forecast/">is explicit in their claim</a> to forecast the BLS report more consistently than does the “consensus”. And furthermore, they present a root mean square error of their forecast (a measure of how close the forecast comes to the actual data) as something below that of the BLS (see Table at the bottom of their <a href="http://hdi.wantedanalytics.com/monthly-bls-forecast/">methodology page</a>). I am not quite clear on how they calculate the error, since they revise their data as does the ADP (again, correction: according to WANTED, they do not revise their forecast ex post, and the MSE comparison may be quite meaningful).</p>
<p>This gets me back to my first point, what is the value added of these pre-labor labor reports? I always thought that the various reports should focus on what are their comparative advantages. For example, the ADP payroll figures likely have information on wages that cannot be ascertained from the BLS&#8217; survey approach. Or WANTED uses online job applications – perhaps it can provide an earlier indication of labor prospects than can the survey as a whole.</p>
<p>We will see what happens tomorrow.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking: What, since the passage of Medicare has the federal government implemented that actually reduced  the risk of living for the US citizen?</p>
<p>No, tax cuts do not count.  They do not reduce risk.  We have reduced risk for business all over the place.  NAFTA, CAFTA, exemption of HMO&#8217;s from anti-trust, removal of banking regulation, reduction of oversight, allowing payment in the form of stock options, all of these promoted ever larger and thus less competition and thus less risk.  All of them allowed a bigger piece of the income pie, thus reduced risk by increasing income.  Tax reductions do not increase income, just decrease expense and ultimately reduce services that people relied on to reduce the risk of living in the US.  We protected Harley Davidson, we financially backed bad business results.  We reduced the 5 mph bumper to 2.5 for the auto industry.   None of this has reduced the risk of living, and have actually increased the risk of living in the US.  </p>
<p>Katrina?  Lead paint in Asian products, contaminated food.  Cut&#8217;s in education, medical, civil services, infrastructure failure.  Privatization <strong>may</strong> have reduced some costs, deregulation <strong>may</strong> have decreased some costs (the supposed Walmart benefit), but all of it shifted cost to the individual removing it from the collective.  It has resulted in a greater risk of financial ruin in an environment that has decreased the share of income to the 99%.   Not having a corresponding rise in income with a rise in productivity only served to increase risk to US. </p>
<p>I want to know of a piece of legislation that actually removed or significantly reduced the risk of living life in the US such that the US citizen was that much closer to succeeding in their pursuit of happiness.  I&#8217;m not interested in some little piece for a sector of the citizenry.  I want to know if anyone can name a piece of legislation such as Social Security, 40 hr work week, Civil Rights, Medicare that has passed since Medicare that actually reduce risk for US such that We the People felt that much more secure in our individual lives in that fear has been reduced.</p>

<p>DC and the blogosphere are all over the resurrection of the Public Option Trigger, the idea that with the right legislation the insurance companies would just straighten up and fly right. Most of the Left is pretty cynical about the idea and rightly so given the insurance companies several decade pattern on driving down what they call their &#8216;medical cost ratio&#8217;, i.e. the amount of your premium dollar actually spent on paying providers for medical care. Where that ratio used to be 95% now it is down to 80%, meaning that insurance companies are taking four times the share of your premium dollar than in the past. The question is whether you could craft legislation that would control overall premium costs in a way that would not pull the trigger? Well I think you can and in fact it has already been done. If you excised the public option what would be left in the bill to control costs? To start with Secs 111-116.<br />
<blockquote>Subtitle B—Standards Guaranteeing Access to Affordable Coverage </p>
<p>SEC. 111. PROHIBITING PRE-EXISTING CONDITION EXCLUSIONS. <br />A qualified health benefits plan may not impose any pre-existing condition exclusion (as defined in section 2701(b)(1)(A) of the Public Health Service Act) or otherwise impose any limit or condition on the coverage under the plan with respect to an individual or dependent based on any health status-related factors (as defined in section 2791(d)(9) of the Public Health Service Act) in relation to the individual or dependent. <br />SEC. 112. GUARANTEED ISSUE AND RENEWAL FOR INSURED PLANS.<br />(snip-the title of Sec 112 tells the story. Plus no recision except for fraud, as defined by the govt and not the insurance co.)<br />SEC. 113. INSURANCE RATING RULES. <br />(a) IN GENERAL.—The premium rate charged for an insured qualified health benefits plan may not vary except as follows: <br />(1) LIMITED AGE VARIATION PERMITTED.—By age (within such age categories as the Commissioner shall specify) so long as the ratio of the highest such premium to the lowest such premium does not exceed the ratio of 2 to 1. <br />(2) BY AREA.—By premium rating area (as permitted by State insurance regulators or, in the case of Exchange-participating health benefits plans, as specified by the Commissioner in consultation with such regulators). <br />(3) BY FAMILY ENROLLMENT.—By family enrollment (such as variations within categories and compositions of families) so long as the ratio of the premium for family enrollment (or enrollments) to the premium for individual enrollment is uniform, as <br />specified under State law and consistent with rules of the Commissioner. <br />(snip-rest of section calls for a study)<br />SEC. 114. NONDISCRIMINATION IN BENEFITS; PARITY IN MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER BENEFITS. (self-explanatory)<br />SEC. 115. ENSURING ADEQUACY OF PROVIDER NETWORKS.<br />SEC. 116. ENSURING VALUE AND LOWER PREMIUMS. <br />(a) IN GENERAL.—A qualified health benefits plan shall meet a medical loss ratio as defined by the Commissioner. For any plan year in which the qualified health benefits plan does not meet such medical loss ratio, QHBP offering entity shall provide in a manner specified by the Commissioner for rebates to enrollees of payment sufficient to meet such loss ratio. <br />(b) BUILDING ON INTERIM RULES.—In implementing subsection (a), the Commissioner shall build on the definition and methodology developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the amendments made by section 161 for determining how to calculate the medical loss ratio. Such methodology shall be set at the highest level medical loss ratio possible that is designed to ensure adequate participation by QHBP offering entities, competition in the health insurance market in and out of the Health Insurance Exchange, and value for consumers so that their premiums are used for services.</p></blockquote>
<p>This if enforced as a pretty strong combination, insurance companies have to take all comers without regard to physical or mental condition, charge each individual or family in the area the same rate, with a small exception of a 2-1 ratio between young and old. Additionally they can&#8217;t rescind the policy for any reason except non-payment or fraud as defined by statute, nor can they refuse to renew it. And most importantly they have to stay within a set medical-loss ratio.</p>
<p>Now clearly the weak point here is that medical loss ratio. Companies will have an interest in making the case that it just HAS to be set lower in each future year, and you can hear the stories now from both directions, companies crying poor while critics point out not so poor that they can&#8217;t afford First Class air travel. So what would a Trigger look like in this mix? Well it seems that it would have to be tied to a certain irreducible medical loss ratio. So we could imagine that the typical acceptable medical loss ratio was set at 95% for Year 1 with a Trigger set at 85%. Each year the companies could try to argue that they need to get a lower ratio and maybe make their case. But each step down gets them closer to Triggering the Public Option and so forces them to strive for efficiencies on the business side not related to denying care outright.</p>
<p>The model works. On paper anyway. The devil is in getting the initial Medical Loss Ratio right and not letting the trigger point get too low. I would still push for a Public Option which allows direct inspection of and competition between Medical Loss Ratios between public and private plans rather than some process of renegotiating them each contract renewal period. But it is not crazy to entertain the idea of a Trigger mechanism.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/medtech/drugs/magazine/17-09/ff_placebo_effect">An article with that title by Steve Silverman in Wired is getting a lot of attention.</a></p>
<p>I actually know a little bit about the placebo effect and depression.  Lo and behold, Silverman&#8217;s key example is the effect of placebos on depression.  He briefly mentions two issues which I would like to discuss at length after the jump.</p>
<p>On the third page of a three page article he finally discusses how depression is quantified.<br />
<blockquote>Big Pharma faces additional problems in beating placebo when it comes to psychiatric drugs. One is to accurately define the nature of mental illness. The litmus test of drug efficacy in antidepressant trials is a questionnaire called the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The HAM-D was created nearly 50 years ago based on a study of major depressive disorder in patients confined to asylums. Few trial volunteers now suffer from that level of illness. In fact, many experts are starting to wonder if what drug companies now call depression is even the same disease that the HAM-D was designed to diagnose.</p></blockquote>
<p>This paragraph vastly understates the problem.  The HAM-D scale is not a cardinal measurement of depression &#8212; the logarithm of the HAM-D score would work just as well.  This means that any comparison the magnitude of changes in depression starting from different initial levels of depression is meaningless.</p>
<p>This is very important, because the difference in the change in HAM-D with modern antidepressants and with placebo is different for different initial levels of depression.  </p>
<p>There is no evidence that anti-depressants do anything for you if you aren&#8217;t depressed.  There also happens to be no evidence that prozac does anything for you if you are mildly depressed.  This is the result of one single experiment which taught Pharmaceutical companies not run trials on mildly depressed patients.  It also matches the result of extrapolation from trials with more depressed patients.</p>
<p>Silverman notes that, not satisfied with sales, pharmaceutical companies are trying to see if modern anti-depressants are good for syndromes different from classical depression.  They are being disappointed.  I think there is no meaningful way to decide if the placebo effect is stronger or if anti depressants just work for, you know, depression.</p>
<p>There is another issue (also briefly noted by Silverman earlier in the article) that HAM-D scale is not like a temperature.  It is based on a form filled out by a caregiver in which the score repeatedly depends on the word &#8220;severe.&#8221;  A co-author of mine Jamie Horder notes that the so called Placebo effect might be the result of (perhaps unconcious) bias in the measurement of initial depression.  People in the clinical trials team are looking for subjects/patients who must be moderately to severely depressed.  If they give a prospective patient a high score on the initial HAM-D they have found a patient.  A low score and they have to keep looking.  </p>
<p>Similarly prospective patients are there because they are willing to participate in the trial.  They show up saying they are depressed.  It is natural to stress ones depressive symptoms if one has just gone out of one&#8217;s way to claim to be depressed.</p>
<p>This basically must create an upward bias in the initial scores.  That means that the improvement of patients given the placebo might be the disappearance of this bias.</p>
<p>Increased pressure to find severely depressed patients (do the the fact that anti depressants work better compared to placebo with such patients) might have caused increased bias and an increased measured placebo effect.</p>
<p>Now I will discuss the brief discussion of the quantitative research</p>
<blockquote><p>Potter and DeBrota&#8217;s data-mining also revealed that even superbly managed trials were subject to runaway placebo effects. But exactly why any of this was happening remained elusive. &#8220;We were able to identify many of the core issues in play,&#8221; Potter says. &#8220;But there was no clear answer to the problem.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>I assume that Potter and DeBrota checked whether the HAM-D placebo effect was a systematic function of initial depression (it doesn&#8217;t seem to be).  </p>
<p>That would be the simplest explanation of what only a silly person would consider an increase in the placebo effect &#8212; patients in newer trials are initially more depressed.  The absolute change in HAM-D due to the placebo effect is greater the more depressed patients are.  This tells us nothing (we would get the opposite result if we used Log(HAM-D) instead of HAM-D.  I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p>I can tell a fancy story <br />1) there is an ever greater shortage of severely depressed people who are willing to participate in a trial which means they must be willing to take anti-depressants and either not taking an antidepressant or not satisfied with it.<br />2) the average initial HAM-D score is holding up because there is more and more pressure to find severely depressed trial participants.<br />3) the bias in the initial assessment is getting stronger and stronger<br />4) measured improvement with placebo ( and with antidepressant treatment) is getting larger and larger.</p>
