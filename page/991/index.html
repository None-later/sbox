                                <p>Brad DeLong shares his lecture notes on the <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/Index.html">equity premium</a>:<br />
<blockquote>There is, somewhere, a marginal investor: somebody just about indifferent between stocks and bonds. If the expected return to stocks were a little higher, he or she would move more money to stocks. If the extra risk associated with holding stocks were a little lower, he or she would move more money to stocks. In either case, that increase in demand for stocks would push their prices up, and so push the relative returns on stocks&#8211;which are the dividends that will be paid out on stocks in the future divided by the stocks&#8217; current price&#8211;down. But this marginal investor fears the risk as much as he or she values the return, and so does not move more money into stocks, and that is why the current price of stocks and the current value of the equity risk premium are what they are.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at patterns of returns over the twentieth century, and try to figure out what this marginal investor has been seeing and thinking to make the equity risk premium what it has been, and then try to figure out what the current equity risk premium is.</p>
<p>&#8230;[I]n only 1% of the years in the twentieth century would investing in bonds for twenty years outperformed investing in stocks; and in that year&#8211;1929&#8211;the twenty-year returns to bonds would be only 8% ahead of the twenty-year returns to stocks. The equity premium puzzle is not due to the specific liquidity or collateral or other institutional properties of Treasury bills that make them especially valuable.</p>
<p>We have climbed into the box of the equity premium puzzle, which has now been locked and sealed with us on the inside. How are we going to get out of it?</p></blockquote>

                                <p>As I was reading another gem from <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/119607">Brad Setser</a> on the Dark Matter controversy (Brad links to a very nice paper by Carol Corrado, Charles Hutten, and Daniel Sichel that shows the investment/GDP ratio has declined even if one included investment in intangible capital), one of his readers points out an <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CHENEY_SAVINGS?SITE=7219&#038;SECTION=HOME&#038;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&#038;CTIME=2006-03-02-15-53-52">AP story</a> where Dick Cheney is telling people to save more.  While that might be sound advice and good for long-term growth prospects, I sort of recall President Bush justifying those tax “cuts” (actually deferrals of tax obligations) by saying he wanted to give people their money back so they could consume more.  Yes – we are ruled by idiots.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/gas-780309.JPG"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/gas-766161.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />As I was reading the <em>Economic Report of the President</em>, I figured it was time to revisit the issue of <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gaspump.html">gasoline prices</a> and the role played by refinery margins.  Our graph shows the retail price per gallon relative to the consumer price index (January 2006 = 1.00) from January 2000 &#8211; when the real gasoline prices were $1.51 per gallon – to January 2006 when gasoline prices were $2.32 per gallon.  Back in April of last year, real gasoline prices had increased to around $2.30 with <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/05/increase-in-gasoline-prices-robert.html">Robert Novak</a> blaming the environmentalists for discouraging the building of new refineries over the past 30 years.  This argument was weird on several levels including the fact that the refinery margin has averaged less than 16% of the price of a gallon of gasoline over the past 6 years.  It is true that the contribution from the refinery margin shows a few spikes – such as the one following Katrina, but the contribution has not only averaged only $0.30 per gallon but also shows little upward trend.  </p>
<p>The <em>Economic Report of the President</em> makes the following points:<br />
<blockquote>Another related factor is that surplus refining capacity has declined substantially during the last 25 years. In the early 1980s, U.S. petroleum refiners were producing at only about 70 percent of their total potential production capacity. In contrast, total refiner output has been over 90 percent of capacity for the last decade. Several factors explain this trend. First, many small, inefficient refineries exited the industry in the early 1980s following the removal of poorly conceived Federal petroleum price and allocation controls that had favored such refineries. Without these controls, inefficient refineries were no longer profitable, and total U.S. refining capacity fell by 19 percent from roughly 19 million barrels per day at its peak in 1981 to about 15 million barrels per day in 1994. Second, low profitability in the refining sector during the early to mid 1990s did not provide the necessary incentive to expand total refining capacity … Refinery profitability increased in the late 1990s, however. As a result, domestic refining capacity rose 12 percent from 1994 to 17 million barrels per day in 2004 … Rising refinery costs and profits explain roughly one-quarter of the increase in average gasoline prices between 2000 and 2005 … Efficiency improvements and restructuring in the refining industry have led to lower operating costs per barrel. Excluding oil and other energy inputs, refinery operating costs fell roughly 20 percent between the early 1980s and 2003. These cost reductions tend to reduce the price of gasoline for consumers. Lower surplus capacity may, however, increase the sensitivity of gasoline prices to temporary disruptions in production at particular refineries … Although U.S. refining capacity and utilization have increased since the early 1990s, these increases in production have not kept pace with U.S. demand for gasoline and other refined products. As a consequence, U.S. imports of refined petroleum products, including gasoline, have grown from 11 percent of total refined product consumption in 1993 to 15 percent in 2004.  Demand for various types of petroleum products within a country and the configuration of its domestic refining capacity drive much of this international trade … Transport costs for refined petroleum products are sufficiently low that international trading can moderate the effects of regional price spikes. For example, when supplies of gasoline and other refined petroleum products ran short in the United States following Hurricane Katrina, and prices began to rise quickly, importers responded to this price incentive by delivering significantly more product to the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>Robert Novak’s disdain for tree huggers is only exceed by his disdain for President Carter – so I find it odd that he longs for the late 1970’s situation where petroleum refineries where producing at only 70% of their capacity.  Note the emphasis on the fact that low gasoline prices and low refinery margins were the main reason why companies did not build new refineries. Also note that efficiency gains have increased the production capacity of existing refineries as well as lowered the cost of refining oil into products such as gasoline.  I also found quite interesting the international trade aspects of this discussion – especially how trade can mitigate the effects of regional price spikes.  Finally, the discussion suggests that if the rising profitability of refineries is expected to continue, then market forces will create the incentives for production of more refineries even without some Cheney-style corporate welfare for the petroleum refineries.  While I suspect most true conservatives would prefer the normal workings of the market place over Cheney-style corporate welfare, Mr. Novak has been advocating the Cheney energy plan for the past 5 years.</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/HPI.asp">House Price Index</a> was just released this morning with the data on house prices in the US for all of 2005.  The <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/4q05hpi.pdf">press release</a> discusses its results for the US as a whole, reporting that:<br />
<blockquote>Average U.S. home prices increased 12.95 percent from the fourth quarter of 2004 through the fourth quarter of 2005. Appreciation for the most recent quarter was 2.86 percent, or an annualized rate of 11.4 percent. The increase during 2005 is similar to the revised increase of 12.55 percent for the year ended with the third quarter of 2005, showing no evidence of a slowdown.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, I prefer using the HPI data to look at individual real estate markets, since real estate markets are inherently local, and so different real estate markets can behave very differently.</p>
<p>The following picture shows the 6-month change in house prices in several &#8220;hot&#8221; housing markets, with a market defined as an individual Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).  Prices were still rising strongly during the second half of 2005 in most of these markets, but the pace of appreciation moderated in all of them.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/hpi_05a.jpg"></p>
<p>The next picture shows the same thing for several markets that missed out on the huge price appreciations of 2002-05.  They seem to have experienced some increase in house price appreciation during 2005, but again, the rate of price increases in all of them were constant or falling in the second half of the year.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/hpi_05b.jpg"></p>
<p>This all seems quite consistent with what Calculated Risk wrote the other day: housing markets seem to be <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/02/housing-slowing-but-not-crashing.html">slowing, but not crashing</a>.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>There&#8217;s a new data release out this morning on <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/newsrel/pinewsrelease.htm">personal income and spending</a>.  The highlights:<br />
<blockquote> Personal income increased $75.2 billion, or 0.7 percent, and disposable personal income (DPI) increased $50.2 billion, or 0.5 percent, in January, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased $76.7 billion, or 0.9 percent.  In December, personal income increased $54.8 billion, or 0.5 percent, DPI increased $47.6 billion, or 0.5 percent, and PCE increased $64.2 billion, or 0.7 percent, based on revised estimates.</p>
<p>&#8230;The January change in personal income was boosted by several special factors&#8230; Excluding these special factors, personal income increased $37.6 billion, or 0.4 percent, in January, after increasing $48.3 billion, or 0.5 percent, in December.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the headline figures are pretty good, below the surface I&#8217;m less happy about this report.  Much of the gains in income were one-time adjustments, and eaten up by higher prices.  Real income growth is still lower than I think we have a right to expect at this phase of an economic expansion; lately the trend annual growth rate has been in the neighborhood of only 2-2.5%.</p>
<p>Two measures of real (inflation-adjusted) income are shown in the graph below, along with consumer spending and savings.  The dark blue line shows disposable personal income (DPI), which is all income (worker compensation, interest earnings, rents, dividends, etc.) minus taxes.  The light blue line shows compensation only, which includes wages, salaries, and benefits paid to workers.  The red line shows consumption spending, while the green line shows the personal savings rate.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/incomejan06.jpg"><br />Note: All series deflated by the PCE deflator.  The effects of the one-time Microsoft dividend payout of December 2004 have been removed to better show recent trends.</p>
<p>While worker compensation grew nicely in the end of 2004 and first half of 2005, compensation growth has slowed markedly since then.  The broader measure of income (DPI) has recovered from some bad months last fall, but has still been growing only modestly since then.  Consumer spending continues apace, but, as has been the case for much of the past year, is being sustained by households drawing down on their savings, not by higher incomes.</p>
<p>Unless real incomes start to grow more strongly sometime soon, it seems very possible that consumer spending could soon start to slow.  And that is one of the principal reasons that I&#8217;m not very bullish about the economy in 2006.</p>

                                <p>News like this makes me shake my head in bewilderment.  Or maybe not&#8230; maybe it just confirms my presumption that market participants are not always particularly rational.<br />
<blockquote>SAN FRANCISCO (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BF4DEE6A5-0F0B-4BA0-81E7-4B0626FCAC10%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8212; Shares of Google Inc. dropped sharply Tuesday but recovered some of the earlier losses prompted by the chief financial officer&#8217;s comment that the company&#8217;s growth rates were slowing down. Google ended the day down $28.17, or 7%, to $362.27. </p>
<p>&#8230;The stock fell as much as 14% to $338.51 immediately after Chief Financial Officer George Reyes&#8217; comment about &#8220;slowing&#8221; growth, though some analysts quickly sought to dampen the market&#8217;s interpretation of the remarks by suggesting that Reyes was not giving financial guidance nor was he sharing information that wasn&#8217;t already expected.</p>
<p>&#8230;Google said that it had stated in SEC filings that its &#8220;revenue growth rate has generally declined over time and we expect that it will continue to do so as a result of the difficulty of maintaining growth rates on a percentage basis as our revenues increase to higher levels.&#8221; </p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, Reyes responded to a question asked at a Merrill Lynch investor conference about why Google&#8217;s third-quarter revenue had been so strong and what Google had done to ignite such growth&#8230; &#8220;Clearly, our growth rates are slowing and you see that every quarter,&#8221; Reyes responded.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of this market turmoil seems to be over this &#8220;news&#8221;: Google&#8217;s CFO said that their growth rate will fall from the roughly 100% growth rates they&#8217;ve enjoyed recently.   </p>
<p>Are you shocked?  Is that surprising to you?  Then perhaps you should sell your shares in Google, too.</p>
<p>Note that I don&#8217;t really have an opinion about whether Google is overpriced, underpriced, or appropriately valued (though I can&#8217;t help but be reminded of how highly Amazon was valued in 1999-2000).  Nevertheless, this &#8220;news&#8221; seems like a stupid reason to sell a stock that Tuesday&#8217;s sellers presumably thought was appropriately valued on Monday.</p>

                                <p>Warning:  This post is probably more for my own benefit than for anyone else&#8217;s edification.  If you’re tired of arguing about trade, then skip this post.  And if you’re not interesting in reading about some rather technical economic research, then skip this post.  On the other hand, if you’ve always wanted to see examples of the actual evidence that makes lots of economists think that more trade can be (but isn&#8217;t always) a good thing, please read on.</p>
<p>I’ve just finished reading yet another paper on trade and growth.  The literature on this topic is enormous, and growing by several papers per year.  But that’s important, and (for the most part) probably a good thing. </p>
<p>The most peculiar thing seems to be happening, however.  It is starting to seem like the discipline is tentatively considering something approaching the vague semblance of agreement about some aspects of how greater openness to international trade affects economic growth.  In the past few years several different papers, using different methodologies, have concluded much the same thing: more exposure to international trade <em><strong>may</strong></em> cause faster economic growth and development, but does not always and necessarily do so, and the determinants of whether trade is good or bad for growth are institutions and other economic policies.  </p>
<p>Put simply, this means that if a country is getting other sorts of economic policies basically right, and has a reasonably well-functioning government, then trade can enhance growth and development, and will raise the quality of life for many more people than it harms.  But if a country only liberalizes trade without getting the rest of its house in order, more exposure to international trade by itself could make many more people worse off than it makes better off.  (Important reminder: international trade, as with most economic transactions, generates some winners and some losers; what we’re interested in is which group is bigger, and how strongly affected they are.)</p>
<p>The number of papers agreeing on the broad outlines of this statement is starting to seem to me to be approaching a critical mass.  The paper that I’ve just read is a good example of this thesis: “<a href="http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&#038;theSitePK=469372&#038;piPK=64165421&#038;menuPK=64166093&#038;entityID=000016406_20051031155510">Openness Can be Good for Growth: The Role of Policy Complementarities</a>”, Roberto Chang, Linda Kaltani, Norman Loayza, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper WPS3763, November 2005.  (For a non-technical summary see <a href="http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:20736333~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:469382,00.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>They write:<br />
<blockquote>We present some panel evidence on how the growth effect of openness depends on a variety of structural characteristics. For this purpose, we use a non-linear growth regression specification that interacts a proxy of trade openness with proxies of educational investment, financial depth, inflation stabilization, public infrastructure, governance, labor-market flexibility, ease of firm entry, and ease of firm exit. We find that the growth effects of openness are positive and economically significant if certain complementary reforms are undertaken.</p></blockquote>
<p>They’re piling on to a lot of other good work in the past couple of years.  For example:
<ul>
<li>“<a href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~rbaldwin/isit.pdf">Openness and Growth: What&#8217;s the Empirical Relationship?</a>” by Robert E. Baldwin, <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w9578">NBER Working Paper No. 9578</a>, March 2003.<br />
<blockquote>“This paper briefly surveys this literature and points out the main reasons for the disagreements [among economists concerning how a country&#8217;s international economic policies and its rate of economic growth interact]. [A]n important study by Francisco Rodriguez and Dani Rodrik (2001)&#8230; show[s] that openness simply in the sense of liberal trade policies seems to be no guarantee of faster growth. However, the conclusion of most researchers involved in either country studies or multi-country statistical tests –  that lower trade barriers in combination with a stable and non-discriminatory exchange-rate system, prudent monetary and fiscal policies and corruption-free administration of economic policies promote economic growth – still seems to remain valid.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Trade does not stimulate growth in economies with excessive business and labor regulations. The authors examine the effect of openness on growth using cross-country regressions in both levels and changes. Results from the levels regressions imply that increased openness is associated with a lower standard of living in heavily-regulated economies. Growth regressions confirm that the effect of increased trade on growth is absent in these countries&#8230;The results imply that countries must create a sound business environment before trade can be used as an engine of growth.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“We find that complementary policies matter&#8230; by expanding trade opportunities Zambian households would earn significantly higher income. [But] securing these higher levels of well-being requires complementary policies, like the provision of infrastructure, credit, and extension services.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“[T]here is a vast amount of heterogeneity across countries in the extent to which growth rose after trade reforms. While the average effect obtained in the large sample is positive, roughly half of the countries experienced zero or even negative changes in growth post-liberalization. Second, generalizations about the factors that may explain these differences are difficult to draw. The preexisting institutional environment of countries, the extent of political turmoil, the scope and depth of economic reforms, and the characteristics of concurrent macroeconomic policies all seem to have a role to play.”</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Such papers seems to be part of an interesting, and notable, convergence of opinion about the effect of trade on growth.  </p>

<p>UPDATE: Regular reader DOR reminds me that there&#8217;s one other point of consensus among economists about trade and growth that I think is fair to make: while there&#8217;s only a gradually emerging agreement that trade <em>can</em> be good for growth under the right circumstances, there&#8217;s near unanimous agreement that protectionism (or the lack of trade) <em>never</em> helps growth.  </p>
<p>Even the seminal paper of Rodriguez and Rodrik (2000), &#8220;<a href="http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~drodrik/skepti1299.pdf">Trade Policy and Economic Growth: A Skeptic&#8217;s Guide to the Cross-National Evidence</a>,&#8221; which really ignited the empirical research of the past few years by harshly (and fairly) criticizing the previous evidence that trade helped growth, said this:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Let us close by restating our objective in this paper. We do not want to leave the reader with the impression that we think trade protection is good for economic growth. We know of no credible evidence&#8211;at least for the post-1945 period&#8211;that suggests that trade restrictions are systematically associated with higher growth rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>So let me amend my summary of the emerging consensus as follows: sometimes trade causes faster growth, and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t.  But protectionism is never good for growth.</p>

                                <p>This morning the BEA released its second estimate of <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/newsrel/gdpnewsrelease.htm">fourth quarter GDP</a>.  The estimate for GDP growth was revised up substantially, but the level was still very low, and the upward revision was no more than most observers had hoped for.  Comparing to the BEA&#8217;s first estimate:<br />
<blockquote>The preliminary estimate of the fourth-quarter increase in real GDP is 0.5 percentage point, or $14.1 billion, higher than the advance estimate issued last month.  The upward revision to the percentage change in real GDP primarily reflected upward revisions to exports, to federal government spending, to equipment and software, and to change in private inventories that were partly offset by an upward revision to imports.  </p></blockquote>
<p>The estimate of nominal GDP growth went from 4.2% to 5.0%, while the estimate of inflation went from 3.3% to 3.6%.</p>
<p>Most forecasters are suggesting that the US will enjoy much stronger growth during the first quarter of 2006 (most estimates are in the neighborhood of 4.0-4.5% growth), though I&#8217;m skeptical that growth will be that strong this quarter, not to mention later this year.  We&#8217;ll know who&#8217;s right at the end of April.</p>
