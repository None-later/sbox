Payroll employment has declined<br>by 3.6 million since the start of the recession in December 2007; about one-<br>half of this decline occurred in the past 3 months.  In January, job losses<br>were large and widespread across nearly all major industry sectors.<br></pre>
<p>&#8230;a bit worse than what I heard was the expectation for headline unemployment (7.5 percent); the December drop in payrolls (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_01092009.htm">cf.</a>) was revised from 524,000 to 577,000.</p>
<p>Added: The current employment situation release reflects the latest benchmark revisions and associated updates of the net birth/death model.  <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/04/even-worse-than-it-looks.html">Not too surprisingly</a>, on balance this makes a bad situation look somewhat worse.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/jan/31/oil-and-gas-companies-trade-unions-strikes">The Guardian</a> discusses fungibles.  Americans are not used to this directness of private company foreign exchanges of workers.  We have relied on visas and encouraging low wage illegal immigration to accomplish this task.  It seems to me we will have to get used to a greater variety of hiring practices from private, &#8216;American&#8217; multi-national companies.  How does one vote their &#8216;party&#8217; when government is all you got, and such change is rapidly going forward so &#8216;efficiently&#8217;.  It is how the process is structured, but we still have old agenda arguments instead of looking at the new rules.  (Actually rules simply hidden from view&#8230;how they stay hidden is beyond my understanding)</p>
<blockquote><p>The government called in mediators from Acas last night in an urgent attempt to end the dispute over the exclusion of British workers from construction contracts which led to a wave of wildcat strikes across the country yesterday.</p>
<p>The attempt to halt the protest came as it emerged that hundreds more workers were ready to join the nationwide strike action. Bosses at Sellafield nuclear power plant confirmed that 900 contractors will vote on a walkout on Monday morning in solidarity with oil industry contractors in Lincolnshire which is at the heart of the dispute after around 300 new jobs were taken by Italian and Portuguese workers.</p>
<p>The conciliation service was called in after around 3,000 workers at oil and power plants across the UK staged unofficial strikes in support of workers at the Lindsey refinery at North Killingholme. The TUC claimed the refinery owner, Total, had made an &#8220;apparent attempt to undercut the wages, conditions and union representation of existing staff&#8221;.</p>
<p>In angry scenes outside plants from Scotland to south Wales, union leaders spoke out against European workers taking construction jobs in the oil and energy industry ahead of British workers. Outside the Lindsey refinery, some protesters called on their colleagues to march on Downing Street.</p>
<p>Shop steward Kenny Ward told the crowd they had to stand together and take on the &#8220;greedy employer&#8221;. He said: &#8220;I&#8217;m a victim, you are a victim, there are thousands in this country that are victims to this discrimination, this victimization of the British worker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Total had put a contract out to tender for a £200m construction project with five UK firms and two European contractors. The Italian company IREM won the contract and supplied its own permanent workforce. It is understood 100 Italian and Portuguese workers are already on site and 300 more are expected next month.</p>
<p>In apparently co-ordinated action, 700 workers at the Grangemouth oil refinery near Falkirk walked out, and 400 more downed tools at the Wilton chemical site in Cleveland. Early morning protests flared at at least eight other facilities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I am flattered that <a href="http://economicsofcontempt.blogspot.com/">the economic of contempt</a> guy* wrote me a long e-mail about my last CDS post.</p>
<p>The e-mail is after the jump.  </p>
<p>my comments on his comments in [brackets]</p>
<p>I am flattered by the attention.  Really, I stress, I only recently learned what a CDS is.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wanted to respond to your comments about CDS, but I hate typing in those tiny little comments boxes, so I figured I&#8217;d email my response instead. I&#8217;ll admit to a little bias on CDS, since I was involved in all the negotiations over the first standardized CDS contracts back in the early 2000s. But I&#8217;m much more critical of CDS (especially the dealers&#8217; role, as I&#8217;ve noted in my own blog posts) than most of the CDS market participants, so I think it evens out.</p>
<p>&#8220;[M]y main argument is that the way to eliminate naked purchases of CDSs is not to ban them directly but to ban cash settlement CDSs so only ignorant people who have never heard of Delphi (like me)  buy naked CDSs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that I think it&#8217;s a bad idea to ban cash settlement in the first place, I don&#8217;t see how you could ban cash settlement without also requiring protection buyers to own the underlying. Just banning cash settlement could (and would) lead to situations where there are more protection buyers than bonds available for delivery, even if every protection buyer believed when he purchased the CDS that he was, or would soon be, a legitimate hedger. If you&#8217;re going to ban cash settlement, then why allow this kind of imbalance to exist in the first place? That&#8217;s just asking a CDS settlement to become what we called during the Delphi debacle, &#8220;bond market musical chairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>[I see no reason to ban people from doing something that hurts only them.  Under my proposal it would be stupid to buy a naked CDS.  This will become clear after another default (evidently it became clear already once when Delphi defaulted).  Now keeping track of who owns what seems to be constly difficult and invasive.  In general I think adults should be free to do stupid things provided they don&#8217;t hurt other people.  If I have a physical settlement CDS and the underlying instrument, I don&#8217;t care if I get paid in full because of the CDS or because people with naked<br />CDSs bid the price of the instrument up to the valued of its scheduled payments even though it is in default.  I think my regulation will have the same effect as requiring people to own the instrument if they own the CDS and it seems to be much less burdensome (need to verify who owns what only after a default, so rarely, and the CDS writer and holder do it so they don&#8217;t bother the SEC).  Now I don&#8217;t believe in the efficient markets hypothesis.   As far as I can naked physical settlement CDS can&#8217;t ever convert into any cash money payment if there are more of them out there than the underlying instrument.  I assume they will trade at a positive price for a while, because I assume investors will make every conceivable error.  However, I also assume that they will wise up and essentially no one will be silly enough to buy a naked physical settlement CDS after a few more episodes of financial musical chairs. In any case, I don&#8217;t see as a legitimate purpose for an invasive regulation the aim to prevent fools from being separated from their money].</p>
<p>&#8220;Your argument against banning naked CDSs lacks two things: 1) any social advantage of not banning them, and 2) any explanation for why you expect stupid CDS tricks like AIGs not to happen in any markets where they haven&#8217;t happened already.&#8221;</p>
<p>As to your first point, the most obvious social benefit of so-called &#8220;naked CDS&#8221; is price discovery. (I know, I know, &#8220;price discovery&#8221; is usually a bullshit argument, but when it comes to the corporate bond market, it&#8217;s actually legitimate.) Corporate bonds are generally illiquid instruments, making them very difficult to price accurately. The CDS market is extremely liquid, and has dramatically improved the pricing of corporate debt. This was one of the original purposes of the CDS market. The vast majority of CDS contracts are traded by investors who don&#8217;t own the underlying bonds. Banning naked CDS would kill the liquidity that has made the CDS market so useful. Without speculators providing liquidity by trading naked CDS, legitimate hedgers would have to pay significantly more for protection.</p>
<p>[here Mr economics of contempt is asserting a very weak form of the hypothesis that markets aren&#8217;t efficient but they are better than nothing.  I am not at all convinced.  In particular I think the pricing of debt implied by the CDS market was totally wrong.  If markets were efficient, then it would be very useful to look up a market price.  If they are not efficient but not totally massively utterly wrong except as often as a stopped clock is right, then price discovery is socially useful.  I don&#8217;t think that market price discovery is socially useful.  </p>
<p>Recall it can be very hard to beat the market even if market prices are far from fundamentals (shown by Shiller and Summers ages ago).  </p>
<p>Also I&#8217;m not sure that any socially useful purpose is served by knowing exactly what bonds are worth.  I&#8217;d say a socially useful interaction of bonds and financial markets is that people can buy a balanced portfolio of bonds &#8212; a bond index fund when they are young and sell it when they retire.  Obviously that&#8217;s not what financial operators are doing.  They care about small brief miss pricing, because they are trying to beat the market with active trading strategies.  I agree this is perfectly legitimate business, but I don&#8217;t think it is socially useful at all (I think the prices of actively traded assets in which extremely smart people are trying to outguess each other are further from fundamental values than are the prices of less actively traded assets).  </p>
<p>My reason for thinking this is that volatility increases when trading volume increases.  It seems absolutely implausible to me that the volatility is rapid change of fundamental values.  I think it is noise and I think there is more noise in prices the more liquid markets are.  Now I admit my ignorance, but I&#8217;m waiting for someone to point to evidence that I am wrong.]</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand why people are so quick to denounce &#8220;speculators&#8221; when it comes to CDS. Speculating is not inherently evil. The options market doesn&#8217;t have any sort of &#8220;naked&#8221; ban &#8212; investors write calls without owning the underlying all the time &#8212; and that market seems to work just fine. Similarly, you don&#8217;t have to own the underlying securities to buy an ETF, nor do you acquire a direct interest in the underlying securities when you actually purchase an ETF. It&#8217;s pure speculation. Speculators provide the liquidity that allows &#8220;real&#8221; investors to move in and out of their positions efficiently. In fact, buying an ETF that tracks the S&#038;P is just like buying an index CDS contract like the immensely popular CDX contracts, which a ban on naked CDS would eliminate. If your argument for banning naked CDS rests solely on the &#8220;speculation&#8221; issue, then you have to explain why you don&#8217;t also favor banning ETFs, &#8220;uncovered&#8221; call and put options, and so forth.</p>
<p>As to your second point, banning naked CDS would have no effect whatsoever on the CDS contracts that brought down AIG. They&#8217;re completely unrelated issues. AIG failed because of CDS it had written on CDOs and ABS. The protection buyer in all of those contracts owned the underlying CDO or ABS (these CDS contracts aren&#8217;t actively traded), so the issue of naked CDS is completely irrelevant to AIG&#8217;s problems. AIG essentially failed because it took on crappy CDOs and MBS &#8212; just like everyone else. So restricting the use of single-name and index CDS in response to AIG&#8217;s failure would be useless at best. In the more likely scenario, it would be extremely counterproductive, as banks would be stripped of an enormous amount of regulatory capital relief in one fell swoop, forcing another round of forced liquidations to meet capital requirements.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s my argument. Hope it helps.</p>

                                <p>I was pontificating earlier today about how many of the now-unemployed Financial Services workers were, in a previous life, engineers of one stripe or another, and if we&#8217;re going to be doing things with the stimulus bill such as re-engineer the power grid, some of them may well decide to return to their previous life.

<p>DeLong: &#8220;Let me, for one, state that I am very glad that Christie Romer has been too busy since her confirmation a week ago Wednesday night to set up procedures for hiring interns. When setting up and posting procedures on the hiring of interns is the most valuable first use of a CEA chair&#8217;s time, there is indeed cause for alarm: it would be a sign that the president is like George W. Bush, who would rather not have had any economic advice at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I note for the record that the CBO sent out their Summer Internship application notice on January 27th.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By now, it&#8217;s clear to everyone that we have inherited an economic crisis as deep and dire as any since the days of the Great Depression. Millions of jobs that Americans relied on just a year ago are gone; millions more of the nest eggs families worked so hard to build have vanished. People everywhere are worried about what tomorrow will bring. </p>
<p>What Americans expect from Washington is action that matches the urgency they feel in their daily lives &#8212; action that&#8217;s swift, bold and wise enough for us to climb out of this crisis. </p>
<p>Because each day we wait to begin the work of turning our economy around, more people lose their jobs, their savings and their homes. And if nothing is done, this recession might linger for years. Our economy will lose 5 million more jobs. Unemployment will approach double digits. Our nation will sink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I feel such a sense of urgency about the recovery plan before Congress. With it, we will create or save more than 3 million jobs over the next two years, provide immediate tax relief to 95 percent of American workers, ignite spending by businesses and consumers alike, and take steps to strengthen our country for years to come. </p>
<p>This plan is more than a prescription for short-term spending &#8212; it&#8217;s a strategy for America&#8217;s long-term growth and opportunity in areas such as renewable energy, health care and education. And it&#8217;s a strategy that will be implemented with unprecedented transparency and accountability, so Americans know where their tax dollars are going and how they are being spent. </p>
<p>In recent days, there have been misguided criticisms of this plan that echo the failed theories that helped lead us into this crisis &#8212; the notion that tax cuts alone will solve all our problems; that we can meet our enormous tests with half-steps and piecemeal measures; that we can ignore fundamental challenges such as energy independence and the high cost of health care and still expect our economy and our country to thrive. </p>
<p>I reject these theories, and so did the American people when they went to the polls in November and voted resoundingly for change. They know that we have tried it those ways for too long. And because we have, our health-care costs still rise faster than inflation. Our dependence on foreign oil still threatens our economy and our security. Our children still study in schools that put them at a disadvantage. We&#8217;ve seen the tragic consequences when our bridges crumble and our levees fail. </p>
<p>Every day, our economy gets sicker &#8212; and the time for a remedy that puts Americans back to work, jump-starts our economy and invests in lasting growth is now. </p>
<p>Now is the time to protect health insurance for the more than 8 million Americans at risk of losing their coverage and to computerize the health-care records of every American within five years, saving billions of dollars and countless lives in the process. </p>
<p>Now is the time to save billions by making 2 million homes and 75 percent of federal buildings more energy-efficient, and to double our capacity to generate alternative sources of energy within three years. </p>
<p>Now is the time to give our children every advantage they need to compete by upgrading 10,000 schools with state-of-the-art classrooms, libraries and labs; by training our teachers in math and science; and by bringing the dream of a college education within reach for millions of Americans. </p>
<p>And now is the time to create the jobs that remake America for the 21st century by rebuilding aging roads, bridges and levees; designing a smart electrical grid; and connecting every corner of the country to the information superhighway.</p>
<p>These are the actions Americans expect us to take without delay. They&#8217;re patient enough to know that our economic recovery will be measured in years, not months. But they have no patience for the same old partisan gridlock that stands in the way of action while our economy continues to slide. </p>
<p>So we have a choice to make. We can once again let Washington&#8217;s bad habits stand in the way of progress. Or we can pull together and say that in America, our destiny isn&#8217;t written for us but by us. We can place good ideas ahead of old ideological battles, and a sense of purpose above the same narrow partisanship. We can act boldly to turn crisis into opportunity and, together, write the next great chapter in our history and meet the test of our time. </p>
<p>The writer is president of the United States. </p>

<blockquote>CBO estimates that the Senate legislation would raise output by between 1.4 percent and 4.1 percent by the fourth quarter of 2009; by between 1.2 percent and 3.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2010; and by between 0.4 percent and 1.2 percent by the fourth quarter of 2011. CBO estimates that the legislation would raise employment by 0.9 million to 2.5 million at the end of 2009; 1.3 million to 3.9 million at the end of 2010; and 0.6 million to 1.9 million at the end of 2011.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=204">CBO Cost Estimate: Summary</a><br />
<blockquote>CBO estimates that if enacted in mid-February, H.R. 1 as amended would increase outlays by $132 billion during the remaining several months of fiscal year 2009, by $242 billion in fiscal year 2010, by $145 billion in 2011, and by a total of $632 billion over the 2009-2019 period. In addition, CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that enacting the proposed Senate amendment to H.R. 1 would reduce revenues by $101 billion in fiscal year 2009, by $219 billion in fiscal year 2010, and by a net amount of $253 billion over the 2009-2019 period. (Approximately $96 billion of the estimated revenue change is attributable to the proposed tax credit for wage earners and $70 billion to the proposed changes in the AMT.)</p>
<p>Combining those effects, CBO estimates that enacting the Senate amendment would increase federal budget deficits by $233 billion over the remaining months of fiscal year 2009, by $461 billion in 2010, by $142 billion in 2011, and by about $884 billion over over the 2009-2019 period.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the meanwhile: Pick your Pork!</p>
<p>(Update. Though it should be clear enough from the formatting none of these numbers are mine. The text in blockquotes has just been cut and pasted right from the original CBO documents.)</p>

                                <p>by Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s time to reread the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html">World Bank report</a> on what creates wealth because it seems that the arguments against the stimulus are from a mind-set of very narrow thinking about what creates wealth.  They all seem focused on what the World Bank report calls “Produced Capital”.   Unfortunately, focusing on just that aspect of capital reduces our nation to growth based on 18% of our economic power.  And, as far as I have understood the arguments for tax cuts, they are based on effecting this small aspect of what produces wealth in a developed economy like ours.  <br />
<blockquote>“The rest of the story is intangible capital. <strong>That encompasses raw labor; human capital, which includes the sum of a population&#8217;s knowledge and skills; and the level of trust in a society and the quality of its formal and informal institutions.</strong> Worldwide, the study finds, &#8220;natural capital accounts for 5 percent of total wealth, produced capital for 18 percent, and intangible capital 77 percent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>You know what that is?  Democratic traditional spending priorities.  <br />
<blockquote>“Rich countries are largely rich because of the skills of their populations and the quality of the institutions supporting economic activity,&#8221; the study concludes. According to Hamilton&#8217;s figures, the rule of law explains 57 percent of countries&#8217; intangible capital. Education accounts for 36 percent.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Get that?  It means tax cuts are just stupid policy if the goal is to stimulate a developed economy as strongly as possible such that the stimulus creates lasting wealth.  Is that not the complaint by the republicans and blue dogs, the lack of lasting wealth which means jobs as the stimulus is written?  What the World Bank report means is, if you want the biggest bang for your greenback, you have to weigh the heavy side of the stimulus to  invest in <em>“human capital, which includes the sum of a population&#8217;s knowledge and skills; and the level of trust in a society and the quality of its formal and informal institutions.”  </em></p>
<p>You have to load the stimulus to the 77% side and not the 23% side (natural 5% and produced capital 18%).   That is 3.4 human capital to 1 natural/produced capital.   That means education (all forms and subjects), support for the economically disadvantaged (welfare, medicaid), health care (medicare, national health payment reform, system IT), risk prevention and recovery (law, fire/rescue, FEMA), science (greening energy, environment)  and the arts (art districts, museums) to suggest a few. </p>
<p>Beyond that, the intentional campaign to sway public opinion by purposefully lying about the way a stimulus such as is being proposed will function, is to actually predestine our efforts to failure. The reason is because the campaign is producing a lack of trust.<br />
<blockquote>“An economy with a very efficient judicial system, clear and enforceable property rights, and an effective <strong>and uncorrupt government will produce higher total wealth</strong>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As noted above, the level of trust in a society of its institutions is of issue regarding the level of capital available to produce wealth.   The greatest harm that is coming from the republican&#8217;s drive to instill their minority will on the many out of selfish want, is to further the demise of the people&#8217;s trust.  For the blue dogs it is their ignorance of their economic ideology that creates the mistrust.  The republicans/blue dogs, and those helping them by lending their &#8220;professionalism&#8221;, think they are only effecting a political strategy.  In truth, they are destroying the very basis for the wealth they desire.  Their entire campaign for decades to discredit, to instill mistrust in the primary institution we have, the US (We the People) government, has been the primary cause to our economic decline.  To increase the level of distrust is to decrease the available “intangible capital” which is  77% of our wealth generating power.   </p>
<p>Pushing tax cuts, dear republicans and blue dogs, is actually working against the economic goal you profess to desire for the American people because enacting tax cuts promotes the weakest power of our economy while the promoting of tax cuts is destroying the strongest power of our economy. </p>

<p>Thinks that <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2009/02/the-great-multiplier-debate.html">this post by Mark Thoma</a> discussing <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2009/02/why_canat_we_al.html">this Post by Menzie Chinn </a>is unusually excellent.  I suggest you go read it.  If interested my thoughts on it after the jump.</p>
<p>ideology. Its just not done to write that the debate is ideologues on one side non-ideologues on the other.  In fact, he lists two ideologies.  However they are both anti-stimulus bill ideologies. </p>
<p>Furthermore they go together not just in congress but in the economics profession.  The debate among economists prominently included the views of people who think government spending is horrible (except they don&#8217;t complain about defense spending) and the market is perfect so it should be left alone and whose views haven&#8217;t been noticibly affected by the recent downturn.</p>
<p>I think the form of Chinn&#8217;s sentence suggests extreme reluctance to say this but, among economists, there are hard core ideologues on one side of the debate and not the other (which isn&#8217;t to say all stimulus critics are hard core ideologues).</p>
<p>Chinn might get himself in trouble by saying RBC models can&#8217;t fit moments, but I doubt anyone will notice the deadliness of the line &#8220;even H-P filtered.&#8221;  He briefly mentions an extreme weakness of RBC models.  The data are H-P filtered markedly reducing variances and covariances, the output of the models are not H.P. filtered.</p>
<p>In my personal experience it is hard to fit the moments  H.P. filetered data, but it is much harder if the output of the model must be run through an H.P: filter too.  Is there any excuse for not running the output of models through H.P. filters.</p>
<p>Let me quote Tom Sargent &#8220;Ed Prescott thinks growth theory should be used to study everything but growth.&#8221; It is very very strange that stationary growth models are written and compared to H.P.filtered data.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be more natural to write down a growing growth model then H.P. filter it and compare it to H.P. filtered data ?</p>
<p>Third point.  Chinn asserts that parameters are chosen so the model&#8217;s output fits the data.  Prescott claims that parameters are not chosen so the model&#8217;s output fits the data, but rather based on independent data (micro data and trends),  Chinn confidently asserts that, when Prescott claimed this, he lied.  </p>
<p>Now on multipliers from RBC and DSGE models.  An assumption of many of these models is that aggregate consumption corresponds to that of a rational  representative consumer with no liquidity constraint.  This is a feature, an important part of the GE ness.</p>
<p>It also implies that tax shifts affect output only via incentives on the supply side, that is, that a multiplier is zero.  So, sure they are not suited to the evaluation of a proposed stimulus involving tax cuts and deficit spending. </p>
<p>But what was the advantage of this assumption ?  The models certainly don&#8217;t fit the data on consumption.  People still argue that rational intertemporal substitution with no liquidity constraint is consistent with the data (often even though the data analysis in the paper with that conclusion rejects that hypothesis) but only by arguing that there are extremely complex non separable utility functions which are not found in real or New Keynesian DSGE models.  So why is it a feature to make an assumption which is rejected by the data ?  Why is it a bug to make an assumption about consumption which is, at least, not demonstrably false ?</p>
