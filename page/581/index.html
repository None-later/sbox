<blockquote><p>My friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War. This is an act of aggression.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/208660.php">Josh Marshall</a> has a real problem with McCain’s personal grandiosity and provides this list:</p>
<blockquote><p>Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, followed by the US expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait. Collapse of Yugoslavia and subsequent wars of aggression between successor states. US invasion of Afghanistan. US invasion of Iraq. There are a slew of other examples of serious international crises over last 16-18 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>So when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in the summer of 1990 and started to turn his military towards Saudi Arabia, this was not a serious international crisis?  I supported Bush41 back then for no reason?  Anyone who believes this nonsense is not qualified to be President.</p>

                                <p>For the last several years there has been a conservative, libertarian  meme that the drop in the savings rate did not matter because the growth in the value of peoples homes substituted for savings.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKXf1OWMWoI/AAAAAAAAAW8/1P0h2ZogqUU/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKXf1OWMWoI/AAAAAAAAAW8/1P0h2ZogqUU/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Even if this was good economics to begin with and did not ignore the point that wealth  is a stock and savings is a flow, mortgage debt now  accounts for over half of total real estate value.  Homeowners now own less than half of their homes free and clear for the first time since this data was collected.  Mortgage debt as a share of real estate value has approximately doubled over the last twenty years.</p>
<p>But if the bulk of the gains in home values during the bubble has been offset by the growth in mortgage debt how does the portion of the increase in value that is offset by increased  mortgage debt count as savings ?</p>
<p>Sorry, I took the chart out of the NY Times and could not separate the two charts even though the second chart is not part of my question.</p>

<p>Will I Live to see 80?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s something to think about.<br />I recently picked a new primary care doctor. After two visits and <br />exhaustive  lab tests, he said I was doing &#8216;fairly well&#8217; for my age.<br />A little concerned about that comment, I couldn&#8217;t resist asking him, &#8216;Do <br />you  think I&#8217;ll live to be 80?&#8217;</p>
<p>He asked, &#8216;Do you smoke tobacco, or drink beer or wine?&#8217;<br />&#8216;Oh no,&#8217; I replied. &#8216;I&#8217;m not doing drugs, either!&#8217;<br />Then he asked, &#8216;Do you eat rib-eye steaks and barbecued ribs?<br />&#8216;I said, &#8216;No, my former doctor said that all red meat is very unhealthy!&#8217;<br />Do you spend a lot of time in the sun, like playing golf, sailing, hiking,<br />or bicycling?&#8217; &#8216;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8217; I said.<br />He asked, &#8216;Do you gamble, drive fast cars, or have a lot of sex?&#8217;<br />&#8216;No,&#8217; I said</p>
<p>He looked at me and said,&#8230;.<br />&#8216;Then, why do you even give a shit?</p>

<p>Diogene’s Lantern:  Can We Shed Some Light On the Issue</p>
<p>Angry Bear has had a long series of conversations regarding the issue<br />of  Social Security and the projections concerning its long term financial viability.  The many threads which focus on this issue have been initiated, for the most part, by <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/06/more-social-security-posts-from-angry.html">postings by Bruce Webb</a>.</p>
<p>Webb’s series concerns itself primarily with those projections, which are based on the Low and Intermediate Cost Assumptions generated by the Office of the Chief Actuary.   Personally, I have some questions about the wisdom of relying on actuarial “assumptions” which attempt to quantify events that are years in the future, often as many as seventy-five years down that road.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses that utilize assumptions, continuously step away from veridical measurement of any set of data.  When one reads the reports referred to in many of these discussions the word assumption occurs frequently.   None the less, the arguments rage on.  Bruce Webb seems to have made a very convincing case to support his hypothesis that the Trustee’s reports tend to be too pessimistic in regards to the financial health of Social Security now and in the future.  (Thanks for being so contrary)</p>
<p>Tangential to the issue of financial viability is the question of resolution and correction.  What are the proposed alternative approaches to the possible financial insolvency of Social Security?  That is an entirely rhetorical question as it is not meant to suggest that there is any likelihood of the system or the Trust Fund, which is intended to supplement that system, is in danger of insolvency at any time in the foreseeable future. </p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xliv-we-cant-grow-our-way-out.html">Bruce wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why oh why are economic conservatives running down America&#8217;s future by adopting Intermediate Cost economic assumptions? Or are they just pretending to accept those assumptions to sell Personal Account plans implicitly requiring better growth? Because as Dean Baker pointed out in his 2004 <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/the-no-economist/policy-analyst-left-behind-test-for-social-security/">No Economist Left Behind</a> challenge, you don&#8217;t get to have both.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the frequently suggested approaches to resolving the unlikely premise of insolvency is to create a system of privately funded retirement accounts.  Such private accounts are generally described by their adherents as being either supplemental to Social Security or, alternatively, a replacement to Social Security. </p>
<p>Often these discussions, regarding such a system of private accounts take place without reference to current examples.  That is peculiar.  There is little need to make assumptions in regards to a system of private accounts because there are already several examples of such retirement accounts that have been in place for at least twenty-five years, maybe longer.  Examples are: IRAs, the various types of 401s and, of course, good old fashioned personal savings and investment accounts.  It is the IRA and 401k accounts that can be said to most closely approximate the private retirement accounts that are being suggested as the supplement to, alternative to, or replacement for the Social Security retirement system.</p>
<p>This being the case a question comes to mind.  Why is it so difficult to discover an analysis of the success of the Defined Contribution (DC) accounts system?  The term, DC account, was coined as a means of differentiating such a retirement fund from the old fashioned company pension, the Defined Benefit Plan.  I like that differentiation between the two.  One is a benefit and the other is your contribution. </p>
<p>The question that keeps coming up in my mind is, who are you contributing to and is there any benefit to your making those contributions?    It is not as though there is a shortage of thoughtful papers written on the pension alternatives issue.  The problem as I see it is that there is <strong>little to find that provides quantitative analyses of the success of privatization plans as retirement alternatives</strong>.  There are many such analyses of social security, as good or bad as those thoughtful papers may be, but few scholarly investigations to the Defined Contributions plans, be they IRA, 401k, or what have you in the aggregate.  Also, as one begins to investigate the available research in the area of Defined Contribution plans it becomes obvious that there are many different parameters on which to measure the success of such plans. </p>
<p>Given that the Defined Contribution plan, privatized retirement funding to the layman, is being tossed around as though they were the best thing since sliced bread, it seems reasonable for those with the skills, time and inclination to address the success, or lack there of, of such plans.</p>
<p>The available materials range from obtuse to arcane as I researched the issue.  Few are definitive.  Many are an obvious effort to support an ideological point of view or make sales.  I will try to look at the actual financial adequacy of such plans.</p>
<p>How much does the average individual put in to the IRA or 401, and how much is left after many years, many fees, reported hidden costs, and much turbulence in the market?  Are these plans really the alternative to Social Security as a protection from poverty in old age?<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />by reader Jack  </p>

<p>Evening news segment: TODAY ON CAPITOL HILL</p>
<p>[roll tape]</p>
<p>Senator Sammmy: &#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, this op-ed in my hands says that the USGS has released a new exploratory study indicating that the Artic region may hold 90 billion barrels of crude oil. And a lot of natural gas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senator Rdan: (whispering &#8211; &#8220;Hold up the USGS press release, Sam.&#8221;) &#8220;Yes, there is a projection that the region may also have 1,670 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable natural gas, and 44 billion barrels of technically recoverable natural gas liquids in 25 geologically defined areas thought to have potential for petroleum.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senator Sammy: &#8220;Right, Senator Dan. These resources account for about 22 percent of the undiscovered, technically recoverable resources in the world. The Arctic accounts for about 13 percent of the undiscovered oil, 30 percent of the undiscovered natural gas, and 20 percent of the undiscovered natural gas liquids in the world. About 84 percent of the estimated resources are expected to occur offshore, according to the USGS report.&#8221;</p>
<p>CBS Reporter Walker: &#8220;Well&#8230;90 billion barrels/80 million barrels per day = 1000 days ~ 3-4 years additional supply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senator Coberly: &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Walker. The point overlooked by Senator Sammy and others is that we don&#8217;t need to burn all that oil. There is some danger in doing so. And if we burn it now we won&#8217;t have it later&#8230;unless of course he expects infinite fields to be discovered. Sadly, we don&#8217;t have infinite atmosphere to be polluted. What we have here is another opinion which is little more than &#8220;this is what I want to believe&#8221; and there are sources I can cite that tell me what I want to believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senator Coberly (holding onto the microphone): &#8220;Finally, it seems that the recent price rise was a bit of overkill, and the market responded by consuming less gas, bringing the price down. Should be a message in there for someone, except the three year olds who want what they want when they want it and what they want is to drive their car at any expense to the planet they don&#8217;t give a damn you see&#8230; but they panic when the price goes up, because got promised them that the price would never go up, so it must be those damned environmentalists who made it go up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Representative Therapist1, Armed Services Committee Chairman: &#8220;However by lessening our need for consuming so much foreign oil, then we can hopefully decrease the market price by removing our demands from the foreign market. Maybe that will put incursions into Georgia out of the cost/benefit range of the Russians.&#8221;</p>
<p>CBO Director Spencer: &#8220;The question is not how much oil is in the ground. Rather, the question is at what price can this oil be extracted. The reason most of this oil is still there, especially the shale oil, is that it can not be profitably extracted at current market prices. Before I can understand the significance of any of the deposits I need to know what it costs to get it out of the ground. If it cost $200/bbl to extract shale oil it is not relevant that we have large shale deposits. Peak oil does not mean that we are running out of oil. We will never run out of oil. Rather, what it means is that we are running out of cheap oil. That is a very different thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Representative Joel: &#8220;Bravo, Mr. Director. Was gonna say the same general thing, but you did it better. Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>House Democratic Whip Denny: &#8220;Oil, oil, oil. There are other methods of powering our &#8216;civilization&#8217; without the attendant damage that oil does to our world. Oh, yes, Chairman Therapist1 &#8211; better read some more on the Russian/Georgian conflict and find out who was the original aggressor in all of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senator Muirgo: &#8220;Yep, lots of cheap oil to be had out West!&#8221;</p>
<p>(After testifying before the Energy Committee) Science Fiction Writer ScentOfViolets: &#8220;There is also the so-called &#8216;energy cost&#8217; as well. It is possible to imagine a scenario where extraction is relatively cheap, but that it takes more than one barrel of oil to process a barrel of oil. If that happens, it doesn&#8217;t matter how cheap or expensive bringing the final product to market is. My guess is that in the future, stuff like this will be processed by nuclear energy. We can synthesize light crude right now using the Fischer-Tropsch process, but for the present, it is uneconomic to do so. I suspect that the future is going to be this route for automobiles; batteries just don&#8217;t seem to cut it without a change in urban/suburban planning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nation Editor K Harris: &#8220;If one wants to avoid the impression of sloganeering, one should avoid a sloganeering tone. Refuting a watered down version of the other side&#8217;s argument is also necessary if one wants to be taken seriously. This piece gets both of these wrong. The first paragraph trivializes objections to arctic oil extraction. That&#8217;s fine if you are preaching to co-religionists, but this isn&#8217;t the NRO or WSJ editorial page. To sway those who don&#8217;t already share the dogma, you have to actually address the subtleties of the other sides views. In short, we&#8217;re not running out of oil, we&#8217;re swimming in it.&#8221; Nice slogan. No thought to the subtleties. The only thing here that needs to have been put in print was the estimates of reserves and expert commentary from Gautier. Everything else falls well below legitimate standards of discourse. I realize that is the norm in a lot of places, but that&#8217;s what&#8217;s wrong with those places.&#8221;</p>
<p>Secretary of Energy Unsympathetic: &#8220;Instead of throwing around words which ultimately are gratuitous for both &#8220;sides&#8221; of the argument.. just show the EROEI &#8211; Energy Returned On Energy Invested. Energy invested for Pennsylvania oil? Not much. Energy invested for shale oil? Until extraction techniques are improved/altered, the energy consumption utilized during the extraction process of &#8220;producing&#8221; one barrel of shale oil is more than the energy stored within that barrel. Peak Oil types like to throw around the total volume of reserves. However, what matters is rate of daily extraction &#8211; and that&#8217;s not increasing. It&#8217;s decreasing. We&#8217;re finding more oil by volume, yes &#8211; but the rate at which those new discoveries can be brought to market is significantly slower than the oil once found in Texas. But, as with all specious arguments, the tenor of the discussion won&#8217;t change, as anti-peak-oil people (anti-reality, really) continuously attempt to shift the discussion back to a point that nobody disputes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senator Sammy: &#8220;This is just two areas in the US, not even considering worldwide potential. There are PLENTY of hydrocarbons available to fuel civilization, almost to the point that investment or technological breakthroughs would release a flood of cheap oil that would wipe out all kinds of investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senator Coberly: &#8220;Senator Sammy, that last quote sounded a bit bizarre. are we holding back on cheap oil to protect investors? Kind of like with diamonds? May i insist, sir, if we had lots and lots of cheap oil we would still have the problem of global warming and other pollution, destruction of the environment. [turning back to the news media] The Sammy&#8217;s of the world don&#8217;t give a damn about that as long as they can keep on doing what they have always been doing&#8230; even though most of that is just learned social display. &#8220;Civilization&#8221; is not the same as endless traffic jams and air unfit to breathe in most cities, and rumored to be killing the planet itself. There really are other ways we could be spending our time with great pleasure to ourselves, and even make a profit at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Representative Joel: &#8220;As soon as there is a way to make energy cheap and abundant, it will become cheap and abundant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Green Party Director Ken Melvin: &#8220;Hear, hear; a toast to delusional kibitzing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senator Sammy: &#8220;Knowing that there is that much oil out there, where do you run your investment analysis? At $120/barrel? or $50/barrel? I&#8217;m at $50, and there is a lot less investment at $50 than at $120.&#8221;</p>
<p>Representative Joel: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know the answer to your question. I do know that your comparison of US reserves in shale oil to the reserves of sweet, easily extracted oil in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, Venezuela, Iraq and Mexico only shows that you should stay out of petroleum investing. You don&#8217;t understand Peak Oil and you don&#8217;t understand the relationship between &#8220;reserves&#8221; and production.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nation Editor K Harris: &#8220;Any chance this could become a peer-reviewed publication? Having started out with a marketing piece for his own position, Senator Sammy is studiously avoiding answering the substance of questions which he cannot comfortably answer and picking oil prices out of the air. This piece was advertized as an editorial. What&#8217;s the point of running editorials? If that is what is needed to substitute unsupported opinion for analysis, then maybe editorials are a bad idea.&#8221; [a strange comment for a magazine editor]</p>
<p>Senator Sammy: &#8220;And you always like my press conferences. Senator Dan thoughtfully brought along the USGS press release supporting the Alaska oil segment. I don&#8217;t think the shale data is in dispute, although the posters are right, there are currently barriers to production. I just thought that the Investor Business Daily op-ed provided a good and provocative summary. Maybe it detracts. But heck, many of the liberal positions are just pulled from other liberals. Why the differing standard here, Mr. editor?&#8221;</p>
<p>Senator Coberly: Senator Sammy, maybe it&#8217;s the difference in quality. I&#8217;d have to disagree with Harris, as I am offering an editorial myself. One that is not especially well supported by data though I expect it to lead to the ability to understand the data I will offer subsequently.<br />Movie Guy Email 08.13.08 &#8211; 10:54 pm #</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>subsequent press conferences. Meanwhile, when I tell you I don&#8217;t give a damn if we are flooded in cheap oil, it is suicide to keep on burning the stuff, why do you come back and ask me what price I am willing to set on shale oil? The point of that last little cri de coeur was what is the point of talking to people when they can&#8217;t hear? An awful lot of the debate that goes on here is a debate of the deaf.&#8221;</p>
<p>CBS Reporter Walker: (repeating) &#8220;90 billion barrels/80 million barrels per day = 1000 days ~ 3-4 years additional supply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senator JDF: &#8220;Walker, the U.S. consumes about 21 mil bpd, so that would give us &#8211; if we didn&#8217;t share &#8211; about 12 years. BUT that&#8217;s assuming we pumped ourselves 21 mil bpd from Alaska. The current pipeline we have in Alaska has capacity for about 1.5 mil bpd, but only pumps about half that. I don&#8217;t know if we could pump that much out of Alaska if we tried, I think it would surely jack costs higher. How much oil could Alaskans pump if Alaskans could pump oil?&#8221;</p>
<p>[fade to reporter] The press conference continued for another twenty minutes. Representative Curse said, &#8220;We should let Russia develop the Arctic fields and then buy oil and gas from them.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>And, I do not want my taxes raised. I already pay a staggering amount of tax and I don’t care for it. In fact, I would like to pay no tax at all. I could have so much more to prepare for onrushing old age.  But the unhappy fact is that it’s necessary to raise my taxes and the taxes of all upper-income Americans. (I do wish, however, that “upper income” started just a dollar above me.)  The sad truth of the last two two-term Republican presidents is that their economic premise, the key part of their economic game plan, simply has not done what it’s supposed to do. That is, cutting taxes, especially on upper-income Americans, does not generate so much economic activity that it replaces all the lost I.R.S. take and then some.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stein is a McCain supporter and (as he states) he doesn’t want his taxes raised.  But he offers the right criticisms of the standard free lunch GOP nonsense, which <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/08/ben-stein-says-taxes-must-come-up">EconomistMom</a> rightfully praises.  But I do have a couple of quibbles:</p>
<blockquote><p>That is, cutting taxes, especially on upper-income Americans, does not generate so much economic activity that it replaces all the lost I.R.S. take and then some. At least those have been the results so far. When Ronald Reagan lowered taxes, personal income tax revenue stagnated from 1982 to 1984. Now, you may say that revenue rose sharply after that. So maybe that was a mixed result … Government spending grew dramatically under President Reagan, very nearly doubling, and leaving us with a federal deficit vastly bigger than the one he inherited.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually nominal spending did not even double during the Reagan years, which meant the increase in real spending was not that great after all.  In fact, the ratio of Federal spending to GDP stayed virtually the same.  And the increase in real Federal taxes over the 1981 to 1992 period was about 17%.  I think EconomistMom needs to have Ben take a few more remedial classes.</p>
