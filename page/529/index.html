                                <p>A Book Review by Stormy</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of globalization, with jobs shifting from “unionized, high-wage regions to non-union states and with “a tidal wave of jobs moving offshore, Laid Off, Laid Low, edited by Katherine S. Newman, is a series of five studies in one volume that tries to “assess employment stability on the structure of careers, on the perceptions of security, and on political preferences.”</p>
<p>The book is part of a series of studies, funded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, examining the “concerted effort to privatize risk, shifting the “responsibility for the management or mitigation of key risks onto private-sector organizations or individuals.”</p>
<p>In short, what has been the effect of globalization and privatization on employment stability? How much has the landscape of employment changed? Where are we going both economically and politically?</p>
<p>The organization of the book leads us through argument and counterargument, moving progressively to larger and larger considerations. The last study examines how politics in the first decade of the twenty-first century may well evolve.</p>
<p>Each of the five studies is a closely reasoned, statistical analysis, generally encompassing the last three decades of the 1900&#8217;s and the beginnings of the present decade. Although general readers may find some of the mathematical analyses daunting, there is more than enough meat for everyone. What is unusual about the work—and I cannot stress this more—is that the studies supplement and complement each other in unusual ways, ways that are not always apparent to the casual reader. For example, we could take the first two studies, which seem to contradict each other and place them in the context of the fourth. What then becomes immediately apparent is that suddenly there are promising avenues for further studies. Can we, for example, look more closely at different kinds of professions, breaking them into other categories—health care and manufacturing, for example?</p>
<p>What immediately struck me, for example, is that I could now see the connection between decreasing job tenure and increasing difficulty for those under thirty-five to enter the housing market. (See George S. Masnick, Nancy McArdle, and Eric S. Belsky, “A Critical Look At Rising Homeownership Rates in the United States Since 1994.”) Since 1985, home ownership for younger people actually declined. The Farber study lays the economic groundwork for understanding these and other events as well. The same can be said of the other studies in the book.</p>
<p>In short, no matter what your interest, this book provides a wealth of analysis and data that moves far beyond its mere 136 pages.</p>
<p>Following is a brief précis of each study and the Introduction, together with my brief response to each. The closer I read the book, the more I was impressed.</p>
<p>Ms Newman&#8217;s Introduction “High Anxiety” places the succeeding studies into the shifting historical context from 1948 to 2008, from the days of one primary breadwinner to the now traditional and mandatory two-income household, from the days when unemployment tended to peak near the end of a recession to now when it peaks much later, from the days when labor and capital occupied much the same geographical landscape, to now when capital is mobile and labor fixed, from days when we use to think that government should control the excesses of private enterprise, to now when we believe that private enterprise knows best, from the days when income disparity was less pronounced to now when the gap between the rich and the working class staggers the mind.</p>
<p>Ms. Newman covers all these issues and more in a clear, expository, forceful style. Without being pedantic, she touches on many of the important studies that have already been done, using them to place the five studies comprising the remainder of the book into an understandable context. The Introduction alone is worth the book.</p>
<p>Each of the studies weeds out the “noise” associated with business cycles, attempting to arrive at general trends. Each carefully provides its econometrics, along with excellent bibliographies. The studies become progressively more complex as the argument evolves.</p>
<p>In some respects, the first two studies seem oddly lightweight, almost out of place. The first does provide some groundwork for Ms Newman’s Introduction; the second is seems to be a weak counter to the first. Yet in the general context of the book, they are excellent introductory studies.</p>
<p>Henry Farber’s “Short(er) Shrift: The Decline of Worker-Firm Attachment in the United States”</p>
<p>Studying the data between 1973-83 and 1996-2006, Farber asserts that there is increased job “churning” for private sector males. Male job tenure in the private sector is growing shorter. Between 1973-83, the mean tenure of males age 50 was 13.5 years; between 1996-2006, it had shortened to 11.4 years. Public sector tenure has grown.</p>
<p>Ironically, the mean tenure of women in the private sector has not been affected. Farber is never quite clear on why this is the case. I kept hoping he would break tenure into professions. (Have women traditionally chosen occupations that are less susceptible to the perils of globalization and corporate restructuring&#8211;health care, for example?)</p>
<p>One of the later studies “Rising Angst” does look at different kinds of professions, although not to the degree I had hoped. Nonetheless, this kind of unstated interplay among the studies makes the book an intriguing read.</p>
<p>Faber concludes “that young workers today should not look forward to the same type of career with one firm experienced by their parents.”</p>
<p>Ann Huff Stevens’ “Long Term Employment in the United States 1969-2004”</p>
<p>Ms Stevens counters Farber with a study that focuses on the longest job ever held by workers near the end of their working lives, concluding that she finds no significant change. Frankly, I see no discrepancy between her conclusions and Farber’s. As Ms Newman points out, “the earliest cohorts had jobs interrupted by service in World War II, resulting in lower average longest tenure than subsequent cohorts.” Additionally, focusing on longest tenure may well miss the kind of churning the Farber study describes.</p>
<p>Benjamin J. Keys and Sheldon Danziger: “Hurt the Worst”: The Risk of Unemployment Among Disadvantaged and Advantaged Males, 1968-2003</p>
<p>Keys and Danziger forcefully state what we all should know: Those at greatest risk of unemployment are most disadvantaged by race and education.</p>
<blockquote><p>High school graduates were 1.9 times more likely and those with some college 1.7 times more likely to exit from work to unemployment than college graduates. The risk of unemployment was twice as high for African Americans as whites.</p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, age plays a factor, a fact that begins to answer Ms Huff’s argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>Workers between the ages of twenty and thirty were 3.2 times as likely as workers between the ages of fifty-one and sixty-two (the baseline age group) to exit from employment to unemployment. Workers between the ages of thirty-one and forty were twice as likely to exit and those between forty-one and fifty were 1.5 times as likely as older workers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Elisabeth Jacobs and Katherine S. Newman: “Rising Angst? Change and Stability in Perceptions in Perceptions of Economic Security”</p>
<p>It is in this study that the book begins to enlarge its scope and its complexity. It is in this solid study that the book really begins to stride over the American economic landscape. The arguments are coherent; the data, substantive. At best, I can touch only on some of the highlights.</p>
<p>Are Americans more insecure about their economic futures? Which groups of Americans are most insecure? Economic insecurity may well be justified.</p>
<p>While certainly those at the bottom of the pile are losing ground, ironically it is those who normally were not insecure that now are feeling angst.<br />
<blockquote>Surprisingly, again given human capital advantages, the change for the worse has been most pronounced for the group we might expect to be most secure: the economic winners, college-educated Americans and managers. When asked whether they are likely to lose their jobs in the next year, an increasing proportion of college graduates have answered “yes” over the last thirty years</p></blockquote>
<p>Education matters, but occupation also matters. While the lowly clerical worker may worry more about job security, he or she can easily find a new job; not so those at the higher levels, the managers, the craftsmen, or the technical workers. Increasingly, these last are feeling the rising angst. Corporate restructuring and off shoring has moved high quality jobs overseas. Ask IBM.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, income inequality is “at the highest level since the Great Depression.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Well-educated managers who are feeling the tremors of job insecurity sit well below the vaunted station of CEOs, and many of those managers have felt the fallout from outsourcing in the form of a thinning of the ranks in middle management.20 Nonetheless, they were far better protected than the blue-collar workers who, as we’ve shown, accurately recognize their persistent vulnerability.</p></blockquote>
<p>Far from tolerating the inequality, Americans are growing increasingly frustrated with it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Increasing levels of frustration with economic inequality track closely with increasing real inequality. This dual trend suggests that Americans’ tolerance for inequality may not have changed, but that the level of inequality the country has experienced over the last several decades has exceeded what Americans are willing to accept.</p></blockquote>
<p>Phillipp Rehm: “Ballot Boxing: Partisan Politics and Labor Market Risks”</p>
<p>While this piece is not quite as well written as the others, it cogently argues that risk and income will govern the political landscape as we move forward. Yes, there are other factors—religion, race, and social mores. Poor people do vote Republican; but “You will lose money if you keep betting against someone who picks a person’s occupation to predict partisan preferences, while you pick some other objective characteristic!”</p>
<blockquote><p>Income inequality and risk polarization should lead to an electoral advantage for the Democratic Party, simply because the decisive voter should have moved to the left. This gives the Republicans strong incentives to focus on a second, crosscutting set of issues — namely values (religion, moral issues). Third, the ever-increasing tightening of income and risk exposure may, again ironically, lead to a decline in the importance of risk exposure for partisanship.</p></blockquote>
<p>The following conclusion I found particularly intriguing and insightful:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, these trends suggest that the American electorate is increasingly “sorted out” into coherent ideological camps. “Cross-pressured” citizens — liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats — are likely to fade in numbers and importance, leaving only liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is difficult within the confines of a blog to do real justice to five separate studies, let alone the fact that they are presented as part of a larger argument.</p>
<p>In my synopsis, I have omitted the many charts and graphs that fill the book’s pages, any one of which would be an apt subject for lengthy commentary. The world is changing; this book is an ambitious attempt to give us some idea of what the changes are and where they are going. It is well worth the read.</p>

                                <p>There are several old timers that post here and I wonder if they have election stories they could tell while we wait for the exit polls.</p>
<p>My story is about the 1964 LBJ-Goldwater election.</p>
<p>In 1964 I was living in Venezuela and on election day I was way down in the interior, a days drive from the nearest paved road.</p>
<p>As was the Latin-Spanish custom we had a late dinner and left the restaurant in the little town at about 11:00 in the evening.  It was a beautiful tropical night within 10 degrees of the equator and the town was already shut down for the night with no lights visible.  The stars were the only light, but it was a sky that so few of us that now live with light and other pollution ever see.  It was easy to understand why our ancestors were so fascinated with the night sky and  developed their mythologies about the stars.</p>
<p>I turned to my colleague and asked, I wonder how the election went.</p>
<p>About that time two donkeys came thundering down the cobble stone street, rushed past us and disappeared down the street.</p>
<p>But of course we did not know if they were celebrating or running for their lives.</p>
<p>After all, at this time in Venezuelan history the Communist were conducting a campaign of killing a policeman a day.</p>
<p>A post script, our host at dinner that night was a German who had been Rommel&#8217;s Aide in North Africa.  In 1964, about 20 years after the war almost everywhere you went in Venezuela you encountered middle aged Germans that you learned not to ask too much about their background.</p>

<p>Sandwichman is serializing Chapman&#8217;s theory on hours of labour at <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/">Econospeak</a>.  The abstract is below.  Part 2 is posted today, Nov. 4.</p>
<blockquote><p> Abstract: Sidney Chapman&#8217;s theory of the hours of labour, published in 1909 in The Economic Journal, was acknowledged as authoritative by the leading economists of the day. It provided important insights into the prospects for market rationality with respect to work time arrangements and hinted at a profound immanent critique of economists&#8217; excessive concern with external wealth. Chapman&#8217;s theory was consigned to obscurity by mathematical analyses that reverted heedlessly to outdated and naïve assumptions about the connection between hours and output. The Sandwichman is serializing &#8220;<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1125543">Missing: the strange disappearance of S. J. Chapman&#8217;s theory of the hours of labour</a>&#8221; on EconoSpeak in celebration of the centenary of publication of Chapman&#8217;s theory.

<p>Some Last Thoughts About the Campaign</p>
<p>I am not involved in either campaign, nor do I have all that much to do with politics other than running the occasional numbers, expressing an opinion voting.  That said, here are my thoughts on the mistakes made in the campaign by both candidates.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s Mistakes</p>
<p>This one is easy.  He should have put more effort into tying McCain to the Bush.  When the Dark Lord quietly endorsed McCain in Wyoming a few days ago, Obama made it into a commercial.  But the pictures of Bush hugging McCain were there for the taking for a very long time.  Plus, how do you let your opponent backpedal from Bush on the economy when his top economic advisor was one of Bush&#8217;s main economic advisors?  It would be one thing if Holtz-Eakin had done some distancing for a few years, a la Colin Powell or Scott McClellan.  But it didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>Another mistake was not picking Hillary Clinton as his Veep, or at least not promising her something big (Sec of State?) early on.  See, he could then have made an arrangement with Bill to have a position in his administration &#8211; perhaps a &#8220;minister without portfolio&#8221; that would allow him to go traipsing around the globe soaking in the worldwide adulation, because that&#8217;s what Bill likes.  And Bill Clinton, unlike GW, is popular, and draws huge crowds and money, and his economic record contrasts nicely with the past eight years.   </p>
<p>McCain&#8217;s Mistakes</p>
<p>McCain&#8217;s mistake was in having no understanding of strategery and human nature.  He assumed that the folks who savaged him eight years ago (the whole illegitimate black baby thing being the worst example) would do anything for him, even assuming they were in a position to do anything for him (which given GW&#8217;s popularity rating, they weren&#8217;t).  Even the footsoldiers among that crowd, the ones for whom he picked Palin, could never be enthusiastic for McCain; they remember making McCain into a b***** in prison parlance eight years ago, and to them, he&#8217;ll always be a be a b*****. I imagine there&#8217;s only way to move up from b***** in prison, and that&#8217;s to make the folks who made you into a b***** in the first place into yours.  And the folks who made him into a b***** eight years ago could have been b*****ified very easily.  See, they they had no choice but to vote for McCain, &#8217;cause the alternative is Obama, and they are not voting for the alternative.  Making matters worse, by pandering to the folks who made him into a b*****, he was also pandering to the folks who made many other people into a b*****.  And now that GW has been crushed, many of those former b*****es are now rebelling, and endorsing his opponent.  Basically, McCain should have made GW and the fighting 25% dance by playing to the middle.  He could have made GW and the fighting 25% his b*****, he had the opportunity, but he preferred to keep that role for himself.  Not exactly CinC material.   And at some lizard brain level, most Americans understand that.</p>
<p>A lesser problem was not finding an issue/message and sticking to it.  A useful one, like the economy.  (Of course, for that he would have had to ditch the Bush hanger-onners like Holtz-Eakin, but that should have been easy to do.)  </p>
<p>Anyway, whether you agree or disagree, if you haven&#8217;t already done so, get out and vote.<br />______________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>update:  OK after getting burned in 200 and 2004 (to paraphrase our President:fool me once shame on you fool me uh fool &#8230; you can fool me twice) only a fool would believe in exit polls tonight (and note the obvious below).  But I just can&#8217;t help myself.  </p>
<p>Looks like the exit pollers are downplaying them everyone wants to tell me how the 71 votes counted in Georgia split.  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/www.pollster.com">Pollster.com</a> has average exit polls from the MSM financer/suppressors of exit polls.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t start celebrating now, or, if you do, don&#8217;t blame me &#8212; blame pollster.com.</p>
<p>update 2:  According to the exit polls which you should not trust it is McCain by one (1) in Mississippi.  Oh my.   For what it&#8217;s worth Obama is 9.5% above the Pollster trend from regular non exit polls.  If I were Senator Wicker I would be worried, but I&#8217;m not so I don&#8217;t pay attention to exit polls.</p>
<p>notes the obvious.</p>
<p>This is going to be a longgggg day for exit pollsters.  Given early voting, they are going to have to pool results from exit polls and earlier results from people who said they voted early in regular polls.  This will not be possible without a wild guess.</p>
<p>They have data on how many people voted early and (bad) data on for whom they voted.  The data from polls on early voters is based on a much smaller sample size than exit polls and is not based on a balanced sample of polling places, but it is still relatively OK compared to the number they just don&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>They will have information on total early votes and on the percentages of Tuesday votes by candidate, but they will just have to guess Tuesday turnout.  I suppose they can ask at their sample polling places, but they will only have a number they can use after polls close (and they typically want to release exit polls the instant polls close).  </p>
<p>Since it appears that a much larger fraction of early voters have voted for Obama than will Tuesday voters this will be critical.  Assuming total turnout equal to 2004 turnout is a recipe for extreme embarrassment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure they have some plan (I&#8217;m sure they all have different plans).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll believe anything until actual votes are counted (tomorrow night looks like a longgg night over here at EST + 6 hours).</p>
