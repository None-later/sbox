But what is it we are saving the planet from? <a href="http://www.blogger.com/_http://www.jennifermarohasy.com/blog/archives/003271.html">Jennifer Marohasy</a> has put up an article titled: <em>Denying the Climate Crisis: A Comment from <a href="http://www.middlebury.net/web-design">Jim Peden</a></em>.<br />We have well over 200 comments and still no Climate Crisis can be defined.<br />Be especially careful of the &#8220;Weather&#8221; reference.</p>
<p>Rdan here: Can we define the &#8220;Climate Crisis&#8221; without mentioning a laundry<br />list of weather events? A flood, a highest/lowest temperature, even a<br />hurricane are weather events, and may even set records . But they are definitely NOT CLIMATE, and therefore not a crisis. So can we define the &#8220;Climate Crisis&#8221; so often mentioned.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Isn’t evolutionary psychology the real challenge to neo-classical rational choice? Isn’t a tool kit of mental functions more plausible and interesting that the utility maximizing model? Isn’t that much more radical than behavioral economics, which is like neo-classical with a cherry on top?</li>
<li>Why don’t economists have a model of when people change their preferences? For example, people seem to change as the age. Is this not true? If it is true, then why don’t we focus more on changing utility functions? Do we really prefer the same stuff all our lives in the same way?</li>
<li>In an argument, economists will concede that people seek stuff other than money, but this is rare in published papers and nearly non-existent in economic theory. Do economists have a theory of when people maximize money as opposed to other stuff (e.g., prestige)? Or which goods are like money (smooth, continuous) and which aren’t? Or which goods are surrogates for money?</li>
<li>Do economists ever believe in endogeneity of preferences? Do economists ever believe that institutions lead to preferences, rather than preferences leading to institutions? For example, isn’t the real reason most Americans belive in democracy is because they grew up in one, not because it maximizes their utility functions?</li>
<li>Do economists really believe Becker’s “as if” argument? Shouldn’t there be many situations where people can’t figure out the optimal outcome? Why can’t “task difficulty” be an important feature of an economic model? Do economists cherry pick situations where optimal moves are easy for people to figure out? Doesn’t the existence of consultants and R&#038;D departments show that firms don’t have easy access to optimal strategies and have to spend much effort in finding them?</li>
<li>Finally, given the critiques from experimental econ, evolutionary psychology and other quarters, why is the basic model of economics still the rational actor? <a href="http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2008/07/25/models-of-rationality-between-gnats-rats-and-gods/" target="_self">Have economists systematically shown it to be superior the other competitors</a>? If so, where can I read about it?</li>
</ol>

<p>They have some good responses in their comments section, and FWIW my response is <a href="http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2008/07/28/five-questions-for-economists-on-rationality/#comment-75769">here</a>.  I suppose if you&#8217;re a thinking non-economist and have gotten your account of economics from Becker, or worse yet from Posner, it would be fair enough to wonder if we actually believe the Chicago School&#8217;s account of the world.  Many of us will say hell, no!  As I recall, Dani Rodrik had a good post up some time ago making the important point that the economics tool kit shouldn&#8217;t be judged by its perhaps tendentious and/or overly influential results derived from more obviously false assumptions on reality.  (I view all social science theorizing as involving a degree of falsity in service of [hopefully] clarifying one&#8217;s thinking, and I&#8217;m definitely not convinced that the other social sciences necessarily have their theoretical heads less in the clouds.)  Maybe there&#8217;s a reason why we make the big bucks after all?</p>

I thought the best thing I could do would be to fill in some ellipses from Mark&#8217;s extended citation:<br />
<blockquote>1. The market economy is the most efficient of all economic systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some market economies are more market, and more efficient than others.  (At the same time?  Hey, is that an underpants gnome over there?!)<br />
<blockquote>2. Free trade helps economic development.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless it&#8217;s trade in intellectual property.<br />
<blockquote>3. Good institutions help development.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, we have no idea what exactly those are.<br />
<blockquote>4. The best measure of a good economy is its growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Growth is also acceptable as a measure of a not-so-good economy.<br />
<blockquote>5. Creative destruction is the engine of economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>So is non-creative destruction (see also #4).<br />
<blockquote>6. Monetary stability, too, is necessary for growth; inflation is always harmful.</p></blockquote>
<p>Especially wage inflation.<br />
<blockquote>7. Unemployment among unskilled workers is largely determined by how much labor costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because some sectors of the economy only have supply curves.<br />
<blockquote>8. While the welfare state is necessary in some form, it isn’t always effective.</p></blockquote>
<p>1. Freedom.  2. ???  3. Dinner on the table!</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t take away our cars.<br />
<blockquote>9. The creation of complex financial markets has brought about economic progress.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the finance and/or litigation sectors.<br />
<blockquote>10. Competition is usually desirable.</p></blockquote>
<p>But we&#8217;re flexible on this in surprising ways.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Did someone feed truth serum to <a href="http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1826219,00.html">Douglas Holtz-Eakin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The choice in this election is stark and simple,&#8221; John McCain said at recent Denver event, repeating a phrase that is a staple of his stump speech. &#8220;Senator Obama will raise your taxes. I won&#8217;t.&#8221;  Seems clear enough, right? It&#8217;s an old argument you already know — Republicans cut taxes, Democrats raise them. Except it&#8217;s not true, at least not in the way that it seems. But don&#8217;t take my word for it. Here is Douglas Holtz-Eakin, McCain&#8217;s chief economic policy adviser. &#8220;I used to say that Barack Obama raises taxes and John McCain cuts them, and I was convinced,&#8221; he told me in a phone interview this week. &#8220;I stand corrected.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So McCain’s own economic advisor is saying McCain’s attack rhetoric on this issue is full of it.  There’s more to this story by Michael Sherer:</p>
<blockquote><p>But don&#8217;t expect McCain to change his rhetoric on the stump. That&#8217;s not how this game is played. On Wednesday, the Obama campaign put out a press release claiming that McCain&#8217;s economic plan was &#8220;$2.8 trillion more expensive than his advisers previously admitted.&#8221; These were ominous words, playing into the old storyline about Republicans using budget gimmickry. But it is largely based on an interpretation of a tax plan — for an optional alternative income tax system with a flat rate — that McCain has never described in detail, let alone with enough specificity to gauge. And it uses a budgetary scoring system that the Obama campaign rejects in calculations of its own proposals.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Obama is saying McCain has turned into the double talk express and that his proposals if enacted would increase an already large Federal deficit – great.  But let’s be honest.  Although Obama’s proposals if enacted would not be as much of a fiscal train wreck as what McCain is suggesting, this is not exactly the fiscal austerity that this deficit hawk has been preaching:</p>
<blockquote><p>It takes some serious work to figure out what they are actually getting at. Neither candidate has laid out an actual plan, with specific numbers, to bring America&#8217;s fiscal house into order. They do, however, offer plans that differ strikingly from each other. McCain&#8217;s tax plan benefits mostly those in higher income brackets, while Obama&#8217;s plan benefits mostly those in lower and middle income tax brackets. McCain wants a tax cut for corporate profits, while Obama has proposed a whole host of tax cuts that will benefit those in the middle-income brackets. Both candidates have new spending programs, though Obama appears to have more. And both candidates say they will cut spending elsewhere, though they fail to provide many specifics about how.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once we factor in the deferred taxes from deficit financing, I doubt middle class Americans will see a long-term tax break regardless of who becomes our next President.  But if McCain becomes President, it does appear that higher income individuals may see lower taxes, which means the average Joe will see higher taxes in the long-run.</p>

<p>I have been somewhat out of contact, but while sitting in a lawn chair far from home I had a brief opportunity to read some of the comments <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/new-place-new-stories.html">to the post</a> I put up courtesy of someone else&#8217;s internet access.  (Also, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/all-economic-analysis-is-counterfactual.html">Tom Bozzo&#8217;s excellent follow-up</a> and <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/this_post_by_cactus_doesnt.php">Megan McArdle&#8217;s critique</a>.)  I&#8217;d like to provide an update&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  Time Warner informed us they&#8217;re again postponing when they can ignore an appointment with us.  Why they need to send someone by I have no idea.<br />2.  Verizon sent us a modem.  However, they also told us they won&#8217;t be able to get us hooked up until the middle of next month.  Having worked for a phone company, I can tell you that for a phone company to hook up a person with DSL if they live close enough to a switch or a remote requires little more than having a tech spend three minutes entering data into a computer terminal.<br />3.  AT&#038;T, which is SBC renamed, includes among its component parts the ILEC (incumbent local exchange company &#8211; the the baby bell that used to provide all service around here pre-1996), tells us they can&#8217;t offer DSL service at all.  </p>
<p>Now, because AT&#038;T is the former ILEC for the area, I assume Verizon&#8217;s DSL service comes courtesy of co-location.  That is, Verizon probably offers DSL service using AT&#038;T equipment.  So either Verizon cannot offer us service at all despite what it is telling us, or AT&#038;T can offer us service despite what it is telling us.  </p>
<p>I realize that the 96 Telecom Act didn&#8217;t exactly deregulate the industry, but it was supposed to provide for more competition.  Now, maybe its all in my head, but I&#8217;m just not seeing it apply to me.</p>
<p>BTW, to everyone who feels that complete deregulation is the solution &#8211; regulation is what allowed the phone system to exist in the first place.  Rights of way through people&#8217;s back yard had to come from somewhere and the phone companies didn&#8217;t exactly pay for them.  I&#8217;m no attorney, but I imagine that complete deregulation (or at least no more collective action to go down the route of another Tom Bozzo plus Megan McArdle set of posts) means AT&#038;T is going to have to do an infinite amount of costly negotiation, since there are an awful lot of people with telephone polls in their backyard.  And BTW, there are an awful lot of power lines out there too.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />This one by cactus</p>

                                <p>This is odd.  Matthew Yglesias just <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/impractical_scheme_of_the_day.php">excerpted</a> a bit of a post at my personal blog, which I didn&#8217;t think was up to AngryBear standards.  Far from it for me to question the judgment of a man who recently reached half my age.  Here is the bit he liked</p>
<blockquote><p>One politically unfeasible approach to this would be to assign people randomly to HMO&#8217;s and pay the HMO&#8217;s based on their health but have the HMO&#8217;s pay for their health care. Then the HMO decides incentives. You have to decide how much a life is worth (and eyesight and all that) but it doesn&#8217;t depend on individual income and the decisions are made by an organisation with tons of data.</p>

                                <p>Did John McCain lie when he said he wanted a clean campaign?  <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/07/mccain_ad_obama_isnt_there_for.php">Eric Kleefeld</a> covers a vicious and very dishonest ad from Team McCain:</p>
<blockquote><p>The McCain campaign has this brutal new attack ad against Barack Obama, making the blatantly false charge that he doesn&#8217;t care about the troops unless there are cameras around … &#8220;And now, he made time to go to the gym, but cancelled a visit with wounded troops,&#8221; the announcer says. &#8220;Seems the Pentagon wouldn&#8217;t allow him to bring cameras.&#8221;  &#8220;John McCain is always there for our troops.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/07/pentagon_confirms_that_it_told.php">Greg Sargent</a> noted the real reason why Obama did not visit the wounded troops:</p>
<blockquote><p>A Pentagon spokesperson confirms to me that because of longstanding Department of Defense regulations, Pentagon officials told Obama aides that he couldn&#8217;t visit the base with campaign staff. This left Obama with little choice but to cancel the trip, since the plan to visit with campaign aides had been in the works for weeks.  The Obama campaign yesterday announced that it had decided to cancel the visit to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, saying that it would be &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; to make such a visit as part of a campaign trip.</p></blockquote>
<p>This only makes McCain both a liar and a petty little man.  But check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHezI5bZ-Sw&#038;feature=related">this Youtube</a> of where Obama played hoops – sure looks like American soldiers to me.  <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0708/About_that_gym_visit_cited_in_McCains_new_ad.html">Jonathan Martin</a> has the details.  In addition to being petty and dishonest, Team McCain is also incredibly stupid.</p>
<p>Update:  <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/obama-skips-visit-with-troops">Jeff Zeleny</a> adds more context:</p>
<blockquote><p>Robert Gibbs, a senior strategist, said the Obama campaign received official permission two weeks ago from the Pentagon to land a plane in Ramstein, Germany. But on Wednesday, he said, military officials advised the campaign of concerns about a political visit being a violation of government rules.  “It is entirely likely that someone would have attacked us for having gone,” Mr. Gibbs said, “and it’s entirely likely &#8211; and it has come about &#8211; that people have attacked us for not going.”  An earlier statement on Thursday from Mr. Gibbs seemed to suggest it was the senator’s decision.  “The senator decided out of respect for these servicemen and women that it would be inappropriate to make a stop to visit troops at a U.S. military facility as part of a trip funded by the campaign,” Mr. Gibbs said.  In any case, had Mr. Obama ended up visiting soldiers who are recovering from wounds in Iraq and Afghanistan, he was not planning to take reporters along. But it never came to pass because of the controversy.  Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, issued a statement emphasizing that the Pentagon did not cancel Mr. Obama’s visit. “Senator Obama, in his official capacity, is always welcome to visit Landstuhl or any other military hospital. But it is not permitted to bring with him campaign staff. His team was notified of that, and they made a decision not to visit the hospital. But we were ready and willing to host him there. In fact, we had made arrangements for his campaign plane to land at Ramstein, and to take care of the campaign staff and press in a passenger terminal there, while the senator and senate staff, if he liked, went on to visit wounded warriors. They made a decision based on their own calculations not to visit. Senator Obama, like any other member of the senate, is always welcome to visit our wounded warriors or our military hospitals around the world. But they do so in their official capacity, and not as a candidate. He can come in and bring senate staffers as well, if he likes, but campaign staffers and press are not permitted to accompany him. That would be a violation of DoD directives.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well – the DoD made this clear as mud!  But if Obama never intended to take reporters and cameras along, McCain’s ad was dishonest on another score as well.</p>
<p>Update II: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/27/ftn/main4297769.shtml">Senator Hagel</a> weighs in:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Republican senator from Nebraska agreed, saying on Face The Nation that the GOP&#8217;s presumptive nominee is &#8220;treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives, and when we start to get into &#8216;You&#8217;re less patriotic than me, I&#8217;m more patriotic.&#8217; &#8220;They&#8217;re better off to focus on policy differences,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just not responsible to be saying things like that, again, if for no other reason than for the good of this country and the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hagel like McCain is a conservative Republican who served in the Vietnam War.  Hagel, however, is not a neocon nutjob.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity">Wikipedia</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>In economics, scarcity is the problem of infinite human needs and wants, in a world of finite resources. In other words, society does not have sufficient productive resources to fulfill those wants and needs. Alternatively, scarcity implies that not all of society&#8217;s goals can be pursued at the same time; trade-offs are made of one good against others. In an influential 1932 essay, Lionel Robbins defined economics as &#8220;the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the Thinkfinity series, the first lesson is the idea of scarcity, and I assume economic goods as example. Modern economic theory is based on this notion, which seems rather obvious.  Duh?? How is such an obvious idea important in particular to a whole field of study?</p>
<p>
<blockquote>In biology, scarcity can refer to the uncommonness or rarity of certain species. Such species are often protected by local, national or international law in order to prevent extinction.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Goods and services<br />Goods and services are scarce because of the limited availability of resources (the factors of production) along with the limits on our technology and skillful people relative to the total amount desired. If somehow people desired nothing, there would be no scarcity. If resources were great enough to produce more than anyone desired, there would also be no scarcity. Scarce resources determine the location of society&#8217;s production possibilities frontier or curve (PPF). Inefficiencies in the use of resources (less than full employment or inappropriate employment of inputs like land and capital) may limit the amount produced so that the economy operates below its PPF. It is difficult to abolish all inefficiencies, and some characterize institutional inefficiency as artificial scarcity.</p>
<p>Goods (including services) that are scarce are called economic goods (or simply &#8216;goods&#8217; if their scarcity is presumed). Other goods are called free goods if they are desired but in such abundance that they are not scarce, such as air and seawater. Too much of something freely available can informally be referred to as a &#8216;bad&#8217;, but then its absence can classified as a good, thus, a mown lawn, clean air, etc.</p>
<p>Where goods are scarce it is necessary for society to make choices as to how they are allocated and used. Economists study (among other things) how societies perform the optimal allocation of these resources — along with how societies often fail to attain this optimality and are instead inefficient.</p>
<p>For example, some fruits, such as strawberries, are scarce in markets on occasion because they grow only at certain times of the year. When the supply of strawberries is lower, they become scarce, or not always available. This scarcity may have an effect on the demand for strawberries. If enough people want strawberries when none are available, then the demand increases. And this demand is high not because the price is low but because the supply is low.</p>
<p>Another example is gold jewellery. Because the amount of gold available is limited, it is necessary to make choices as to how it is allocated. In a market economy, this is achieved by trade. Other ways to make this decision involve tradition, community democracy and centralized command. In the market, individuals and organizations, such as corporations, trade resources amongst themselves, reallocating resources to where they are most wanted by those with purchasing power. In a smoothly operating market system, the rate of exchange between different resources, or price will adjust so that demand is equal to supply. One of the roles of the economist is to discover the relationship between demand and supply and to develop mechanisms (such as pricing, incentives, or penalties) to achieve an optimal outcome (in terms of consumer welfare).</p>
<p>Certain goods are likely to remain inherently scarce by definition or by design; examples include land and positional goods such as awards generated by honor systems, fame, and membership of elites. These things are said to derive all or most of their value from their scarcity. Even in a theoretical post scarcity society, certain goods, such as desirable land and original art pieces, would most likely remain scarce. But these may be seen as examples of artificial scarcity, reflecting societal institutions. That is, the resource cost of giving someone the title of &#8220;knight of the realm&#8221; is much less than the value that individuals attach to that title.</p>
<p>As informational goods can be copied at negligible cost, they do not need to be scarce. This is why copies of software such as GNU/Linux are typically available for very little cost. However, proprietary software and many other products are kept artificially scarce through intellectual property protection laws, most commonly copyrights and patents.</p></blockquote>
