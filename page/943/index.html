                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/10/one_again_there.html">Mark Thoma</a> coined the term Fuzzcharts as a way of expressing how incredibly stupid <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=M2ZjZDFhMTFlMjAyYTcwMjdjNGU1NDllZjRlNjljOWM=">Jerry Bowyer</a> is.  Bowyer writes:<br />
<blockquote>Last week the Nobel committee announced that this year’s prize in economics would be going to Dr. Edmund Phelps of Columbia. This is good news indeed for advocates of supply-side economics. Phelp’s principal academic achievement is his successful rebuttal of one of the central tenets of modern Keynesianism: the Phillips curve.  Someone should alert the board of governors at the Federal Reserve of Phelps vindication, since the minutes released from the Fed’s most recent meeting still contain the same old Keynesian gobbledygook … Phelps has disproved the Phillips curve, at least as a long-run economic planning tool. He argues persuasively that labor markets determine the unemployment rate over the long run </p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Thoma replies:<br />
<blockquote>it&#8217;s been quite a long-time since anyone seriously suggested a permanent tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, particularly since Phelps, Friedman, Lucas and others came up with came up with the expectations augmented short-run Phillips curve to rebut this idea. Thus, the commentary below strikes at a position &#8211; a permanent tradeoff between inflation and output &#8211; that no economist that I know of holds. It is the nature of the short-run Phillip&#8217;s curve that is at issue, how long the short-run tradeoff persists, the steepness of the tradeoff, whether hybrid versions of the Phillips curve are needed, etc., and contrary to what is stated in this commentary, the existence of a short-run Phillip&#8217;s curve is well-accepted. I do agree with the commentary&#8217;s suggestion that somebody doesn&#8217;t understand this literature, but I doubt very much that it is Bernanke, Mishkin, and others at the Fed that are the ones missing key pieces of this line of research … Saying that economists believe &#8220;growth causes inflation&#8221; mischaracterizes the issue. Nobody believes that growth is inflationary. Increases in productivity (i.e. growth in aggregate supply) puts downward pressure on prices. It is growth in demand relative to growth in supply that matters, and if demand growth outstrips supply growth, inflation will result.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, the problem with Bowyer’s idiocy can be seen if one compares his graph to that provided by <a href="http://knzn.blogspot.com/2006/08/phillips-curve.html">KNZN</a> a couple of months ago:<br />
<blockquote>For practical purposes, the Phillips curve – the version that is used to guide forecasts and generate policy prescriptions today – is not a relationship between unemployment and the level of inflation; it is a relationship between unemployment and the change in the inflation rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Bowyer is looking at the first derivative of prices with respect to time when he should be looking at the second derivative.  Then again – I suspect Jerry Bowyer has no clue what a second derivative is.  He certainly has no clue as to what Dr. Phelps and other economist have been discussing for the past forty years.</p>

<p>The GOP talking points seem to have a couple of themes.  One was on display during yesterday’s <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6355022">All Things Considered</a>, which often invites E.J. Dionne to discuss certain political topics with a conservative.  E. J. is usually excellent when he’s not having to waste time rebutting the spin of David Brooks.  During the 2004 election buildup, NPR made a very good move by having Chris Caldwell replace Brooks and Chris was fantastic.  Alas, yesterday’s show had the one person who could make Brooks look honest by comparison – Rich Lowry.  Lowry’s spin on the Iraq War was that opposition to it was based on nothing but feelings as we Democrats have no plan.  Of course, that’s the GOP trilogy: we have no plan, our plan would be a disaster, and President Bush has already adopted our plan.</p>
<p>But hang on – this was to be about economics and Lowry said something about gasoline prices that I agreed with and gives me my excuse for a graph.  After climbing so dramatically, it was only “natural” that they fall.  So Lowry then asked why the GOP was not getting more credit for this decline.  Odd – he couldn’t mention any policy moves that led to this recent decline and as our graph shows, inflation-adjusted gasoline prices in September weren’t exactly low in comparison to where they were say in 2000 when Governor George W. Bush was hammering the Clinton-Gore White House on gasoline prices.  OK, they may have fallen another $0.25 per gallon in the last few weeks, but they are still higher than they were at any point during 2000.</p>
<p>Kash turns <a href="http://%20streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/economic-cheerleading-economic.html">The Street Light</a> on the other theme, which he labels Economic Cheerleading, Economic Misleading with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/18/AR2006101801502.html">George Will</a> leading the way:<br />
<blockquote>Economic hypochondria, a derangement associated with affluence, is a byproduct of the welfare state: An entitlement mentality gives Americans a low pain threshold &#8211; witness their recurring hysteria about nominal rather than real gasoline prices &#8211; and a sense of being entitled to economic dynamism without the frictions and &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; that must accompany dynamism. Economic hypochondria is also bred by news media that consider the phrase &#8220;good news&#8221; an oxymoron, even as the U.S. economy, which has performed better than any other major industrial economy since 2001, drives the Dow to record highs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ever noticed how Will decides to use fancy words to disguise the fact that his columns are almost devoid of substance?  Kash summarizes Will thusly:<br />
<blockquote>GDP growth has been strong, Will writes. The federal budget deficit is low. Oil prices are down in recent months. And weak measures of labor compensation (such as those that I showed you the other day) are simply due to measurement problems, according to Will. It&#8217;s one of those pieces that makes me lose heart a bit. Every single one of the points that Will makes is misleading, disingenuous, beside the point, or all three.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then he does a very nice job of contrasting Will’s spin to reality.  But I wanted to highlight one aspect of how wingnuts like Will pull off their misleading spin:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Worst economy since Herbert Hoover,&#8221; John Kerry said in 2004, while that year&#8217;s growth (3.9 percent) was adding to America&#8217;s gross domestic product the equivalent of the GDP of Taiwan (the 19th-largest economy) &#8230; But since the Bush tax cuts went into effect in 2003, the economy&#8217;s growth rate (3.5 percent) has been better than the average for the 1980s (3.1) and 1990s (3.3). Today&#8217;s unemployment rate (4.6 percent) is lower than the average for the 1990s (5.8) &#8211; lower, in fact, than the average for the past 40 years (6.0) &#8230; President Bush&#8217;s tax cuts were supposed to cause a cataract of red ink. In fiscal 2006, however, federal revenue as a share of GDP was 18.4 percent, slightly above the post-1962 average of 18.2. And the federal budget deficit was $247.7 billion, just 1.9 percent of the $13.1 trillion GDP. That is below the average for the 1970s (2.1), 1980s (3.0) and 1990s (2.2) &#8230; Kevin Hassett and Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute, writing in National Review, say annual wage growth since 2000 has been 0.6 percent, but the annual increase in real hourly compensation, including benefits &#8211; and if you do not include them, why are they called benefits ? &#8211; has been 1.3 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since we – and many others – have covered this nonsense about how the Federal finances are allegedly in such great shape, I want to point out how Will has to go back to 2000 to make the claim that real compensation growth has been wonderful and see what considering the same period of time would do as far as his dubious claim that real GDP growth is incredible.  Real compensation growth in 2001 was 1.8%.  Over the next two year, real compensation growth averaged 1.4% per year.  In 2004, real compensation grew by 0.7% and real compensation has declined since the end of 2004. </p>
<p>Will notes that over the past year (mid-2005 to mid-2006), real GDP grew by 3.5%.  In the previous year, it grew by 3.1%, and from mid-2003 to mid-2004, real GDP grew by 4.5%.  For the previous three years, however, real GDP growth averaged about 1.2% per year.  Over this entire six year period, real GDP growth averaged less than 2.5% per year.  Most economists concede that economies that slip into a recession will eventually recover.  To paraphrase Rich Lowry, this occurs “naturally” and should not be attributed to Bush’s 2003 tax cut. If Will thinks the last three years were so fantastic, maybe he should consider the period after the Hoover years since he is criticizing Senator Kerry.  Real GDP grew by 10.8% in 1934, by 8.9% in 1935, and by 13% in 1936.  I doubt the average American thought the 1930’s were the best economy ever – so why would anyone think that a 3.5% growth rate over the past year was so incredible?</p>

                                <p>Republicans consider themselves the party of family values.  Leaving out issues that are directly religious, if there are two social issues Republicans have claimed as their own since Ronald Reagan ran for President, they are unwed mothers and abortions.  The first issue may have hit its peak when Dan Quayle found himself arguing with Murphy Brown, but its still potent in some parts of the country.  Abortion, of course, is the quintessential single-voter issue in the US.  </p>
<p>Those for whom such issues are the most important issue, of course, will vote Republican.  But have they been well served?  Data on unmarried mothers is available from the Federal Governments’ <a href="http://www.childstats.gov/americaschildren/tables.asp"> Forum on Child and Family Statistics </a> from 1980 to 2004, and data on abortions is available from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/06s0093.xls"> Census </a> going to 2002.   </p>
<p>First, the unmarried mother issue….</p>

<p>The yearly percentage change in the percentage of births to unmarried mothers (i.e., births to unmarried women as a share of total births) from the year before a President took office to his last full year in office:</p>
<p>Reagan___4.27<br />GHW_____4.03<br />Clinton___1.23<br />GW______1.83</p>
<p>The data indicates that the unmarried birthrate rose during the Reagan, GHW, and GW administrations, and fell during the Clinton administration.  The percentage of total births due to unmarried women rose during all four administrations, but rose the least under the Clinton administration.  </p>
<p>As to abortions…. the yearly percentage in the rate of abortions per 1,000 women fell throughout, but it fell the most during the Clinton administration:</p>
<p>Reagan___-0.88<br />GHW_____-1.50<br />Clinton___-2.32<br />GW______-1.18</p>
<p>The yearly percentage change in the rate of abortions per 1,000 live births also fell the most during the Clinton administration:</p>
<p>Reagan___-0.81<br />GHW_____-1.34<br />Clinton___-1.97<br />GW______-0.77</p>
<p>Thus, abortions fell throughout the period, but they fell the most during the Clinton administration.</p>
<p>If I worked for the RNC and I had to explain the results, I would say that there’s a long lag time between a President’s efforts and when those efforts pay off – hence, the efforts of Reagan and GHW paid off during the Clinton era, but Clinton’s lack of effort began to sow problems as soon as he left office.</p>
<p>My bet… a part of this is due to the economy’s performance under Clinton.  Both abortions and children born out of wedlock are probably less likely when people are more hopeful about the future.  I also suspect the President sets a national mood, in part by using the bully pulpit, and in part by where he puts money and resources.  (From a family values perspective, Clinton’s negatives would relate to greater permissiveness…  while teen cigarette use, alcohol use, and drug use all dropped under Reagan, GHW, and GW, they all increased under Clinton.)</p>
<p>But I know this… if I worked for the Democrats, I’d make sure one-issue voters saw these numbers in the next few weeks, and again in 2008.</p>
<p>PS.  My spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them.</p>
<p>Update.  Corrected some of the data which had previously been copied from the wrong cells in the spreadsheet.  My apologies.</p>

<p>I normally don’t revisit old posts, but I don’t always get my point across.  I’m going to try again on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/externalities-suvs-and-driving-with.html"> SUV externality issue, </a> and I’m going to be more concise.</p>
<p>1.  Being in an SUV increases the visibility of the vehicle driver<br />2.  The presence of SUVs reduces the visibility of other vehicles on the road<br />3.  As a result of #2, SUVs impose negative externalities (e.g., reduced safety, wasted time) on occupants of other vehicles.</p>
<p>Similarly,</p>
<p>a.  Driving with one’s bright lights on increases the visibility of the vehicle driver<br />b.  The presence of vehicles driving with their bright lights on reduces the visibility of other vehicles on the road<br />c.  As a result of item b, vehicles with their brights on impose negative externalities (e.g., reduced safety, wasted time) on occupants of other vehicles.</p>
<p>I assume none of this is in dispute.  So… why is driving with one’s bright lights on illegal, and driving an SUV legal? </p>
<p>Conjecture… the difference is that SUVs are externalities imposed by the wealthy, whereas bright lights are externalities that can be imposed by anyone.  (A Hummer costs $100K, while even very poor car owners can afford to strap a searchlight to the hood of their vehicle.)  Agree?  Disagree?  Am I missing something?</p>

<blockquote>Former President George Bush said Tuesday that although he believes the U.S. economy is strong, he&#8217;s worried that the average citizen might not be getting that message. Speaking at a restaurant industry conference in Dallas, Mr. Bush pointed to third-quarter earnings gains, robust growth in the gross domestic product and &#8220;unemployment that has fallen to good levels.&#8221; &#8220;The unmistakable picture that those statistics mean to me is that the economy is strong,&#8221; the 41st president told attendees of the Multi-Unit Foodservice Operators conference, who gave him a standing ovation when he entered the room. &#8220;There is a concerted effort to make it appear that the economy is bad,&#8221; said Mr. Bush, the father of President George W. Bush.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/credit-where-credit-is-due.html">Kash</a> has lots of charts and analysis to support this statement:<br />
<blockquote>the US economy has not, in fact, been that great from the point of view of average Americans.</p></blockquote>
<p>But has overall growth been great?  Sure we have had some pretty decent growth rates since mid-2003 but this is no surprise given the weak real GDP growth from mid-2000 to mid-2003.  Real GDP in 2006QII was only 15.64% higher than it was in 2000QII.  That translates into an average annual growth rate equal to 2.45%.  And yes, the unemployment rate today is higher than it was six years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: An AB reader directs us to something from <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Economy/bg1978.cfm">James Sherk</a> of the Heritage Foundation entitled <em>Shared Prosperity: Debunking Pessimistic Claims About Wages, Profits, and Wealth</em>.  One might think – based on this title – that Mr. Sherk would be rebutting what Kash said, but look more carefully at his evidence:<br />
<blockquote>To these critics, America has all but returned to a new era of corporate Robber Barons, with entrenched inequality and opportunity only for a fortunate few. The only problem with this seemingly compelling argument is that it is not true. The critics’ statistics, while usually accurate, are also incomplete and out of context, and so give a misleading impression of the state of the economy. A comprehensive look at the data reveals that most Americans have shared in the United States’ rising prosperity and that America remains the land of opportunity &#8230; The facts, however, show otherwise. Economic growth has benefited more than a small minority of Americans. Chart 1 shows the percentage of Amer¬ican households who reside within each of five dif¬ferent income brackets. Between 1979 and 2004, the proportion of American households with infla¬tion-adjusted incomes below $75,000 fell by 10.1 percentage points, with the largest drop coming in the number of households earning less than $35,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>If one looks at the period from 1979 to 2000, the proportion of American households whose real income was less than $35,000 did decline, but since 2000, this proportion has been increasing.  </p>
<p>Shrek uses the same trick to suggest the average American has more wealth:<br />
<blockquote>the evidence shows that American households are worth more than ever. After adjusting for inflation, the net worth (assets minus liabilities) of the median American family rose from $70,800 in 1995 to $93,100 in 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>Net worth for the median family in 2001 was indeed higher than it was in 1995, but compare 2004 to 2001 and you see virtually no increase.  Shrek is a little more candid about wages:<br />
<blockquote>The most straightforward mea¬sure of Americans’ economic well-being is their earnings. By this measure, the pessimists appear to have a point because the statistics tell an unpleasant tale. The government measures average hourly earnings for non-supervisory workers, which (after adjusting for inflation) rose during and immedi¬ately after the tech bubble but have fallen slightly since 2003. Similarly, the median wage fell by 2 percent between 2003 and 2006. By this mea¬sure, it would appear that American workers are at best treading water.  However, these discouraging statistics do not tell the whole story. Taken alone, they portray workers’ living standards in the most negative light possible by ignoring almost a third of what workers earn. Benefits are an increasingly large component of worker compensation and now account for 30 percent of workers’ pay—and this proportion has risen sharply in recent years &#8230; Strong growth in total compensation means that workers are better-off today than three years ago and much better-off than they were at the height of the tech bubble. One government mea¬sure of total compensation, called “Employer Costs for Employee Compensation,” shows that total compensation has risen by 3 percent since 2003 and 9 percent since 2000 after adjusting for inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Real compensation growth was strong in 2001 in part because real wages continued to grow.  Notice that Shrek has to admit the real compensation growth has averaged a mere 1% per year over the past three years – even though the economy has been inching back to full employment.  Now before you go looking for some of Kash’s old Angrybear posts about the rise in the cost of health insurance tempering Shrek’s claim that we are getting greater fringe benefits, he’s beaten you to the punch with these assertions:<br />
<blockquote>Some critics respond that higher benefits leave workers no better off because the increases merely reflect the higher cost of health care and not an increase in actual earnings. This argument fails on both fronts. Even after excluding what employers spend on health care, worker com¬pensation has increased; and even after accounting for the rapid rise in the cost of health care, employee health benefits have still grown. Employers are providing their work¬ers with more benefits and are not just keeping pace with health care inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Employers are providing more health benefits?  Huh?  But the real winner in this spin comes from his discussion of workers’ share of income:<br />
<blockquote>Some critics respond that higher benefits leave workers no better off because the increases merely reflect the higher cost of health care and not an increase in actual earnings. This argument fails on both fronts. Even after excluding what employers spend on health care, worker com¬pensation has increased; and even after accounting for the rapid rise in the cost of health care, employee health benefits have still grown. Employers are providing their work¬ers with more benefits and are not just keeping pace with health care inflation … A better basis for comparison is national income, which accounts for depreciation as well as statistical dis¬crepancies between the way the gov¬ernment measures the components of GDP and components of income. By this measure, workers’ share of income has varied normally in recent years. Since the mid-1960s, the employee share of national income has fluctuated between 69 percent and 73 percent, and movements since 2000 have remained largely within these bounds. Though workers’ share of income fell in 2006, it is still well above the lows it hit in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. In 2005, workers’ share of income actually hit a 25-year high.</p></blockquote>
<p>But look at his chart and notice that the 2005 figure was a bit of an aberration.  Actually, this spike was for the third quarter of 2005 when reported national income fell because of a temporary dip in corporate profits.  For most of the post 2000 period, labor’s share was down from its 2000 level even using Shrek’s dubious assumption that proprietor’s income should be seen as being about 70% labor and 30% capital income.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB116095813231693416-lMyQjAxMDE2NjEwNjkxNTY4Wj.htm">Wall Street Journal</a> op-ed, which relies on a report from the <a href="http://www.freetrade.org/briefs/tbp-023.pdf">Cato crowd</a> says no.  <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002609.html">Max Sawicky</a> turns his microphone over to Rob Scott who takes exception.  In a floating exchange rate world, I might tend to argue – along with Robert Mundell – that allowing for free trade with other nations is not aggregate demand reducing.  After all, why not just criticize the incompetence of domestic demand policies if we head towards a recession?  But the folks at the Wall Street Journal lose even the free trader in me when they write:<br />
<blockquote>So has China &#8220;cheated&#8221; in the trade arena by holding the yuan artificially low relative to the dollar? The yuan has been pegged at 7.92 against the dollar since the mid-1990s, and Beijing has begun to allow a modest fluctuation in the last year or so. But this is not a &#8220;manipulation&#8221; of its exchange rate so much as it is a contracting out of its monetary system to the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. That strategy has allowed China to remove the uncertainty of exchange-rate fluctuations from investment decisions and allowed China to grow rapidly while controlling inflation (so long as the Fed controls it too, which is a separate issue).  The Chinese have thus avoided the bane of most developing nations of inept monetary controls leading to price fluctuations and periods of hyper-inflation. China was one of the few Asian nations that didn&#8217;t face a crippling currency devaluation during the monetary crisis of the late 1990s. Nor is it clear that a yuan revaluation of even 10% to 30% would have any meaningful impact on the U.S. trade deficit. China imports some $100 billion a year of raw materials. A stronger yuan would lower the price of those inputs, and thus of production costs, which could largely offset the impact of the stronger currency on export prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rob Scott has all sorts of rebuttals to some of the sillier claims in this op-ed but let’s focus on a couple:<br />
<blockquote>They claim that rapidly rising exports to China prove that it isn’t restraining imports. Yet U.S. imports from China were six times as large as exports in 2005, as shown in the Journal’s own table … The Journal claims that revaluing the Yuan might not reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. The last period of booming trade deficits was corrected after the Plaza Accord, which reduced the trade-weighted value of the dollar by about 30%. Dollar depreciation is the best tool available for reducing trade deficits. Revaluation of the Yuan is the critical linchpin needed to reflate currencies throughout Asia against the dollar; without these adjustments, the unsustainable trade gap cannot be reduced. Stabilizing the U.S. current account deficit (the broadest measure of our trade deficit) will require an additional 40% dollar devaluation (most of the needed adjustment is against Asian currencies</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s review U.S. exports and imports over the past 20 years – as shares of GDP.  From 1986 to the early 1990’s that dollar devaluation did lead to the export share rising relative to the import share.  During the Clinton years, however, the export share grew only slowly imports rose to about 15% of GDP.  While the import share was modestly higher in 2005 at 16.2%, the export share had dipped and was just under 10.5% of GDP in 2005.  We’ve noted before that the weak aggregate demand growth during the Bush years is partly due to weak export demand. </p>
<p>Here is where the WSJ op-ed gets really nutty:<br />
<blockquote>The standard response from the China-bashers (just as the Japan-bashers argued two decades ago) is that America is &#8220;exporting&#8221; jobs overseas. But over the time period that trade with China has surged, so has the number of new jobs created here.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our imports from China have exploded rising from only 0.11% of GDP in 1986 to 1.95% of GDP in 2005.  Much of that increase has come recently as we have relaxed trade restrictions on Chinese imports – a move I generally applaud.  The share of our GDP coming from our exports to China has grown from 0.07% of GDP to 0.34% of GDP.  In other words, export growth has been anemic as compared to import growth.  Perhaps part of the story is Asian Central Bank mercantilism in the form of a pegged Yuan.  And yet the WSJ editorial board seems to ignore just possibilities as they either ignore or distort the factual record.  </p>
<p>Without question, a Yuan revaluation would increase our net exports to China.  However, we should also note that even a 30% revaluation is neither likely to completely close our bilateral trade gap with China nor our overall trade gap.  <br />Kash over at his <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/exchange-rates-that-follow-not-lead_17.html">new blog</a> provides some insights as to the role of exchange rates as well as fiscal policy on our current account deficit:<br />
<blockquote>In this context, what this means is that the results of the paper by Thomas and Marquez serve as an excellent reminder of the fact that we should not expect the value of the dollar to fall by a lot until the underlying causes of the US current account deficit (namely insufficient national savings, both by individuals and by government) change.  Once US consumption growth slows, and/or consumption growth in the rest of the world picks up, the US current account deficit will be able to fall.</p></blockquote>
<p>My own thoughts on the roles of trade protection, fiscal policy, and exchange rates have tended to follow <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/two-comments-on-yuan-revaluation.html">Mundell thinking</a> with a few qualifications:<br />
<blockquote>If you are thinking that Dean left off trade protection (the first quibble), maybe Robert Mundell might help rescue Dean’s claim – assuming we eventually move to a freely floating yuan. Mundell might tell the trade protectionists that tariffs on Chinese imports would be offset by a yuan devaluation so that our exports to China would decline as much as the tariffs reduced our imports from China. But this Mundell line of thinking leads me to my second quibble as I have been whining about the U.S. budget deficit. To say the U.S. fiscal stimulus does not impact the trade deficit apart from possible impacts on the value of the dollar is akin to saying an outside shift in the demand for a good does not induce more production apart from possible impacts on the price of that good. But again – I’m assuming a freely floating exchange rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>As this WSJ op-ed endorses a continuation of Bretton Woods II, let me suggest that if exchange rates are fixed, then trade protection would raise net exports and aggregate demand.  Now you might argue that we are near full employment, but some of us (e.g., Kash) are hoping for some variation of fiscal restraint, which would hopefully allow for a realignment of currencies that would increase our exports.  But then I forgot that the WSJ editorial board often opposes the kind of tax increases that would be required to achieve significant fiscal restraint.</p>

                                <p>It is three weeks from the next election and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/10/brad_delongs_mo.html">Brad DeLong</a> drinks his morning coffee and urges everyone to vote Democratic for the sake of checks and balances and the proper functioning of the Constitution.  Tim Russert has been using a few of his Sunday shows to allow for debates among those who wish to serve in the Senate.  A couple of days ago, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15210576">Meet the Press</a> covered the Minnesota Senate race between Mark Kennedy and Amy Klobuchar.  Klobuchar is the Democrat and is serving in her second term as Hennepin County Attorney. Mr. Kennedy is the Republican and judging from this debate is a bit of a jerk as evidenced by his closing statement:<br />
<blockquote>They don’t see a lot of support out there for giving Social Security to illegal immigrants, for rationing prescription drugs, and for bringing the same policies that has made, and the same bad judgment that’s made Minneapolis having twice the murder rate of New York City under her tenure &#8211; talk about accountability &#8211; to the U.S. Senate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Blaming the prosecutor for the fact that a city has murders?  Huh?  The crack about “giving Social Security to illegal immigrants” comes from the fact that Amy Klobuchar has praised the efforts of Senator McCain and President Bush on immigration reform.  Who knew this President and Senator McCain was so liberal as to increase Social Security benefits for illegal immigrants?  This whole debate turned sad as Mr. Kennedy kept attacking his opponent using these kinds of distortions.  </p>
<p>But the big difference between Kennedy and Klobuchar turned on fiscal responsibility.  She’s for it and he seems to be against it.  Take for example this exchange:<br />
<blockquote>REP. KENNEDY: We have had six million new jobs. The economy was flat on its back after 9/11. We passed tax relief to reward, and people—to let them keep more of their hard-earned money. Families, small business, those that take risk and create jobs. Six million new jobs have been created. We cannot be raising taxes, putting this economy back on its back, and also not growing jobs. We have to keep the approach of keeping spending under control. I’m the author of the line-item veto. I don’t understand why we want to build a bridge to nowhere in Alaska, a rain forest in Iowa.  <br />MR. RUSSERT: But you voted for both those proposals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, we can have less taxes and more spending as money grows on trees.  Klobuchar talked about trimming the excesses from the Prescription Drug Benefit, which prompted this from Kennedy:<br />
<blockquote>She comes out and says in, in an ad that she’s going to save $90 billion, $90 billion, by having government-run prescription drug program on a program that only costs 60 billion. How do you save 90 billion on a program that costs 60 billion?</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect Klobuchar was using those ten-year windows to suggest reforms could save around $9 billion per year – which of course, Kennedy decides to distort (by the way reducing the amount of a government subsidy is not necessarily rationing so I didn&#8217;t get that particular Kennedy remark either).  But is Kennedy suggesting that this program will only cost $600 billion over the next decade?  Maybe he’s a little behind given the dishonest accounting the White House used to trick true fiscal conservatives into voting for this overly expensive bill that was not financed by a current tax increase.  And it does seem that Mr. Kennedy is opposed to anything that would scale back the cost of this legislation.  Yet, he claims that Bush’s policies have cut people’s taxes – even though we all know that the Bush fiscal record is a massive increase in Federal debt, which means increases in deferred taxation.  </p>
<p>Should the citizens of Minnesota vote for this kind of fiscal stupidity?  Then again – most Republicans nationwide are running on this free lunch nonsense.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>My physics sucks.  I don’t remember much from high school or college, and its not like I use it on a regular basis.  But as I recall, almost everything in classical mechanics can be derived from F = ma.  (Force = mass times acceleration.) </p>
<p>Consider two accidents.  In Accident A, 2 battleships collide, where each is going about 10 mph (yeah, I know, they don’t measure ship speed in mph, but how many of us at this blog know what knots are?).  In Accident B, 2 subcompacts, each going at the other at 10 mph collide.  If I understand the F= ma formula, it means that all else equal, you should prefer to be in one of the subcompacts than in one the battleships, because the “m” in accident B is so much less than the “m” in accident A, which means the “F” you face in accident A is going to be so much larger.</p>
<p>Now let me meander a bit more.  Close to where I live, there is a big road that runs from North to South (and of course, from South to North in the other direction).  There are protected left hand turn lanes facing each other.  Thus, a car going North that wants to turn left, and a car going South that wants to turn left will each enter the protected turn lane, and face each other across the intersection.</p>
<p>Now, something I’ve noticed.  It often happens that if the first car in one of the protected lanes is an SUV, cars in the other protected lane will net turn, even if there are no other cars on the road in the direction the SUV came from.  This is especially with large SUVs – Hummers, Excursions, Yukons, etc.  Having been in that position myself, I can state categorically, the reason is that you cannot see around the SUV. </p>
<p>SUVs are also hard to see around in other situations, and that forces other drivers to change their driving patterns, slowing down traffic.  They also slow down traffic in another way – they have a larger footprint, reducing the number of vehicles that can occupy the same amount of limited road space.  I would guess if the data were available, one could show that congestion gets worse faster when there are a lot of SUVs on the road.  Put another way, the SUV driver is imposing externalities on the drivers of other vehicles.</p>
<p>Now, it seems we cannot prevent people from SUVs.  After all, Americans have rights, and that includes the right of inconveniencing others.  But do they always?  An example where people’s rights are limited is that one is not normally allowed to drive with one’s bright lights on.</p>
<p>There are many similarities between driving with one’s bright lights on and driving an SUV.  In both cases, all else being the same, the driver is made safer because visibility is improved.  In both cases, the increased safety comes at the cost of the safety of others; those facing oncoming bright lights or anywhere on the road with an SUV have less visibility themselves.  Furthermore, the benefits of either disappear when enough other people do the same.  (Decreased visibility, and in the case of two SUVs crashing, well, there’s F= ma.) </p>
<p>I would guess that that driving with one’s bright lights on is illegal, and driving a Hummer is not, is precisely because it is possible for everyone to drive with their bright lights on. Heck, even a driver of very modest means can strap a searchlight to the roof of their vehicle if they’d like.  On the other hand, I believe a Hummer costs about $100K. </p>
<p>Is there any other reason?  Am I missing something?  And one other question… I’ve heard libertarians argue that there’s nothing wrong with driving an SUV.  Would a libertarian argue the same about driving with a very large laser pointer on one&#8217;s hood, and if not, why not?</p>

                                <p>Regular Angry Bear readers will (hopefully?) have noticed that I haven&#8217;t been writing  regularly for quite some time.  Well&#8230; I&#8217;m back.  However, while I will be posting occasionally on Angry Bear, most of my day-to-day writing will now be on my new blog, <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/">The Street Light</a>.  From the blog&#8217;s <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/welcome-to-street-light.html">first post</a>:<br />
<blockquote>For about two and a half years, I was one of the principal writers on the blog Angry Bear, writing about economics and politics. It is a great blog, and I had lots of fun with my excellent coauthors trying to keep up with current news in economics and politics in the US. During my time as a principal writer at Angry Bear we saw it all, from the ridiculous to the sublime. True, the ridiculous moments seemed far more common, but oh well.</p>
<p>Then, I was forced to take a bit of hiatus from blogging by the demands of the rest of my life. Yah, it’s that old “real life” excuse: jobs, moving, family, and so forth. It turns out that those things can take up quite a bit of time, if you actually pay attention to them. But now I’m now ready to put all of that behind me and get back to blogging again.</p></blockquote>
<p>I realize that this move is a risky one; on Angry Bear, I&#8217;ve always been able to hide behind the fact that it wasn&#8217;t exclusively my blog.  Now I will have no such excuse&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>Tucked into a massive energy bill that would open the outer continental shelf to oil drilling are provisions that would slash future royalties owed to the federal government by companies prospecting in Rocky Mountain oil shale deposits. Sponsored by Rep. Richard Pombo, R-Stockton, and passed by the House earlier this year, the bill would amend an existing requirement that the federal government receive a “fair return” from oil companies that hold oil shale leases on public lands. Instead, Pombo&#8217;s bill would reduce royalties from the customary 12.5 percent of annual revenue to 1 percent … The provision would benefit the energy industry, which is a heavy contributor to Pombo&#8217;s re-election campaign.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/">Duncan Black</a> for discovering Pombo’s <a href="http://www.tbo.com/news/nationworld/MGB293FYATE.html">excuse</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Pombo stands by his provision, a spokesman said.  &#8220;The chairman and the majority of the members of the [House Resources] committee feel that it is the right thing to do because it is such a massive resource that it could provide relief for consumers and strengthen our economy,&#8221; Pombo aide Brian Kennedy said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The good news is that President Bush and certain Senate Republicans are not so sure that they wish to support Pombo’s proposal.  But let’s discuss the economics of providing below market rates to government owned resources.  Sure, it would tend to give a little more incentive to oil production.  But don’t higher oil prices already give incentives to develop these resources?  Pombo is pretending that the incidence of these subsidies will most accrue to consumers rather than suppliers.  In other words, he is assuming that the elasticity of the supply curve exceeds the elasticity of the demand curve.  But suppose that the elasticity of the supply curve is low – as depicted in the diagram drawn by <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/04/more_political.html">James Hamilton</a>.   <a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=042806F">Arnold Kling</a> provides a verbal discussion in his “Energy Policy for Idiots”:<br />
<blockquote>Who would benefit from a short-term suspension of the 18.4-cent-per-gallon retail gasoline tax? Probably not the American consumer. The biggest beneficiary might be Iran.  In the short run, the supply of gasoline is fairly inelastic. Current inventories of crude oil and refined products are fairly difficult to adjust, so that the supply of gasoline is what it is. That is why it is pretty certain that drivers face a &#8220;tough summer,&#8221; in the words of the President. If the supply of gasoline is what it is, then the price of gasoline will be whatever it takes to limit demand to meet the supply. If that means $3.00 a gallon, then consumers are going to end up paying $3.00 per gallon, no matter what the tax is on gasoline. (Note: this analysis applies only in the very short run. In the long run, supply is elastic, so that some of a tax cut would be passed through to consumers.)  If the tax cut on gasoline will not be passed through to consumers, then where will it go? It will go to oil suppliers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Subsidies are similar to reduction in tax rates.  So what is Congressman’s Pombo’s evidence on the long-run elasticity for demand and for supply?</p>
