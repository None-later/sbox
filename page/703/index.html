                                <p>In comments, reader Gordon links to <a rhef="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSGOR27660220080212?pageNumber=1&#038;virtualBrandChannel=0">this story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fear that a hobbled banking sector may set off another Great Depression could force the U.S. government and Federal Reserve to take the unprecedented step of buying a broad range of assets, including stocks, according to one of the most bearish market analysts.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Legal changes would be needed to give the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government the authority to buy stocks. Currently the Federal Reserve can buy only debt issued by the Treasury, as well as U.S. agency debentures and mortgage-backed securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>I, frankly, oppose any bail-out.  A small mom and pop business in the same position would get no help at all.  Why taxpayer money then go to helping a company that is then going to turn around and pay all sorts of benefits to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/54/UBGJ.html">this guy</a> until the day he dies, especially given since that dude is one of the people who got his company into the mess in the first place.  But we all know the bail out is going to happen.  A guy worth $900 million shouldn&#8217;t be forced to pay for his own country club membership or health insurance.  This is America, after all.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s a question&#8230; if the government is going to pony up huge sums as in the S&#038;L bailout, put itself on the line with massive loan guarantees as in the Chrysler bail-out, or if the prestige of the Federal Reserve will be brought to bear as with the Long Term Capital Management mess, all of which will benefit the shareholders of the banks and all of which will costs us, the taxpayer something, why shouldn&#8217;t the taxpayer get something for it?  Seriously.  What are we, chumps?  </p>
<p>And here&#8217;s what this taxpayer thinks we should get:  equity.  The government can sit on that equity or put it in a trust or whatever.  Five years later, when prices go up (none of that Resolution Trust Corporation nonsense), it can sell.  The proceeds can be used to cut debt or in lieu of taxes or whatever else.   And if the company doesn&#8217;t like having a big chunk of its equity in the government&#8217;s hands, then they can either provide some sort of equivalent collateral or do without.  Anything else and, once again, the taxpayer will be the sucker.</p>

                                <p>38% of American families living below a more accurately drawn poverty line?</p>
<p>50 percentile (technically, mean third-quintile) family income for 2005 was <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f03ar.html"><br />$56,277</a>.</p>
<p>A plausible poverty line for a family of three (on the &#8220;minimum needs&#8221; table on p.44 of the 2001 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raise-Floor-Wages-Policies-That/dp/0896086836/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1202941506&#038;sr=8-1">Raise the Floor</a>) is $33,345 in 2008 dollars &#8212; if health care is otherwise covered. Add $10,000 for a 2008 family health policy and we get a plausible poverty line (as opposed to the implausible federal line computed at 3X the price of a super cheap diet) for a family of three of $43,345. (Raise&#8217; supplies extensive explanations for its minimum needs numbers in Appendix B &#8212; its budget tables cite Solutions for Progress as their source.)</p>
<p>The difference between second and third quintile mean family income ($35,000, $56,000) is about $1,000 per percentile. That computes ($35,000 is 30 percentile + $8,000 more is 8 more percentile) to 38% of American families living below a believable poverty line (at least without food stamps and other helps &#8212; <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/hh-fam/cps2006.html">average family size is 3.13 persons</a>).</p>
<p>I have been touting 25% as a realistic poverty line &#8212; just doubled the 12.5% official line &#8212; made a conservative fit with Raise the Floor&#8217;s doubling of official criteria (was more than doubling &#8212; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States">being the official criteria for a family of 3)</a> &#8212; conservative because, if anything, I expected the low income curve to be flatter than 45 degrees. It seems it was flatter than I even guessed.<br />Assuming I can&#8217;t find something wrong with 38% in poverty. The media continuing to report 12.5% poverty without qualification is like reporting in Columbus&#8217; time that the world is flat &#8212; it makes no waves; but informed people know otherwise.</p>
<p>Moreover a possible 38% poverty line should have progressives wondering whether we are looking at more subsidized than nonsubsidized purchases of proposed health care vouchers. May it be time to consider a straightforward voucher system instead of the clunky payroll tax (to cover vouchers)-plus-mandated purchase concoction (if we must have private plans)?</p>

                                <p>John McCain has started attacking Barack Obama on earmarks.  Via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/02/earmark-track-record.html">Greg Mankiw</a>, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/13/AR2008021303635.html">Washington Post</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton helped secure more than $340 million worth of home-state projects in last year&#8217;s spending bills, placing her among the top 10 Senate recipients of what are commonly known as earmarks, according to a new study by a nonpartisan budget watchdog group. Working with her New York colleagues in nearly every case, Clinton supported almost four times as much spending on earmarked projects as her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.), whose $91 million total placed him in the bottom quarter of senators who seek earmarks, the study showed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I bet Dean Baker might ask how do these numbers compare to the gross state products of New York and Illinois?   During 2006, GSP for New York was $900 billion and GSP for Illinois was $507 billion.  This $340 million represents 0.0378% of New York’s GSP, while the Illinios percentage was 0.0179%.  </p>
<p>While the WaPo is saying McCain abstained from earmarks, one might ask him how much the Iraq War is costing in comparison to the New York and Illinois earmarks.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: When <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=02&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=washington_post_newsflash_obam">DeanSpeaks</a> You Listen:</p>
<blockquote><p>it could have described the earmarks supported by Obama as 0.003 percent of the federal budget or alternatively their cost is 30 cents per person in tax dollars per year. Another useful metric is the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The earmarks supported by Senator Obama are equal to 0.05 percent of the cost of these wars. The money committed to these earmarks would fund the wars for about 5 hours.</p></blockquote>
<p>Senator Obama opposed this war from the start.  Even Senator Clinton wants to end it ASAP.  Of course, John McCain would be happy to continue this war for a long, long time.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Thanks to the AB reader who told us about <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/2008/2008_02_11/cover.html">The Madness of McCain</a> by Justin Raimondo who notes a Ron Paul style speech made by a younger John McCain:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fundamental question is: What is the United States’ interest in Lebanon? It is said we are there to keep the peace. I ask, what peace? It is said we are there to aid the government. I ask, what government? It is said we are there to stabilize the region. I ask, how can the U.S. presence stabilize the region?&#8230; The longer we stay in Lebanon, the harder it will be for us to leave. We will be trapped by the case we make for having our troops there in the first place. What can we expect if we withdraw from Lebanon? The same as will happen if we stay. I acknowledge that the level of fighting will increase if we leave. I regretfully acknowledge that many innocent civilians will be hurt. But I firmly believe this will happen in any event.</p></blockquote>
<p>Justin then suggests we replace “Lebanon” with “Iraq”.  McCain also noted in 1990:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you get involved in a major ground war in the Saudi desert, I think support will erode significantly. Nor should it be supported. We cannot even contemplate, in my view, trading American blood for Iraqi blood.</p></blockquote>
<p>Justin documents how McCain’s view on intervention have evolved and offers this explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p>But what seems to account for his evolution from realism to hopped-up interventionism is nothing more than sheer ambition. This was the case in 1983, when he defied the Reagan administration over sending U.S. soldiers to die at the hands of a Beirut suicide bomber, and in 1999, when the cry went up to take on Slobodan Milosevic. He was positioning himself against his own party, while staking out a distinctive stance independent of the Democrats. It was, in short, an instance of a presidential candidate maneuvering himself to increase his appeal to the electorate &#8211; and, most importantly, the media … McCain’s reasoning is circular: according to him, our government’s edicts must be obeyed because they are, by definition, non-negotiable—even by Americans. A certain course, once taken, must be pursued to the bitter end, even if it acts against our long-term interests. McCain’s worldview, which admits no possibility of error, is undiluted hubris.</p></blockquote>
<p>Justin continues his discussion as to why McCain is not fit to be our commander in chief.  Yes, this is published in the American Conservative but I think it is a very compelling argument.</p>

                                <p>Trade and inventories are treated differently in the GDP accounts.  All other GDP data is the average of the three months data.  But trade and inventories are the change from the end of the quarter to the end of the quarter.  This is because we not not directly measure output. Rather, we measure consumption and adjust that for the chage in trade and inventories to indirectly estimate output.</p>
<p>But this is a major source of revisions to the data.  When the preliminary data is released  there is no data for inventories and trade in the final month.  That is reported in time for the first revision of the GDP data.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R7R9aZhuVWI/AAAAAAAAAHU/a4JA31P6Ljs/s1600-h/Clipboard01a.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R7R9aZhuVWI/AAAAAAAAAHU/a4JA31P6Ljs/s320/Clipboard01a.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />This quarter this should generate significant upward revisions to the reported growth of real GDP in the 4th Q of last year.  The real trade data for December was released this morning.<br />This chart is of the data and the arrow points at the September data, the end of the last quarter.<br />Note that the November observation &#8211;the next to the last data point &#8211;was below the September observation. So using the November data it looked like the real trade balance expanded in the 4th Q &#8212; a negative for real GDP growth. But now we see that the December data is above the September, so we now know that in the fourth Quarter the real trade balance contracted, a positive for real GDP growth.  We only have some nominal data for December inventories, but it strongly implies that the inventory data in the next GDP report will be resived significantly.  These two recent data reports imply that when the next real GDP report is released we will see that 4th Q, 2007 real GDP growth was from 0.5 to 1.0 percentage points higher then the 0.6% originally reported.</p>

                                <p>For some, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7239748.stm">this</a> is one of the &#8220;thinkers&#8221; on the Supreme Court:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the interview with the Law in Action programme on BBC Radio 4, he said it was &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; to assume that the ban on &#8220;cruel and unusual punishment&#8221; &#8211; the US Constitution&#8217;s Eighth Amendment &#8211; also applied to &#8220;so-called&#8221; torture.</p>
<p>&#8220;To begin with the constitution&#8230; is referring to punishment for crime. And, for example, incarcerating someone indefinitely would certainly be cruel and unusual punishment for a crime.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well then, if its just an issue of punishment for crime, I have to wonder if Scalia believes there is anything in the Constitution that prevents the government from simply picking people up on the street at random and applying &#8220;so-called&#8221; torture.  It makes for a fine way to cow the population.  </p>
<p>But some other dude called <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=37139&#038;st=soviet+constitution&#038;st1=">Ronald Reagan</a> put it better:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve read the Soviet Constitution—was surprised to find it contains some of the same provisions of our own as regard to freedoms of the people. Of course they don&#8217;t observe them, but they&#8217;re there in the Constitution. But I&#8217;ve always gotten a thrill out of saying to these young people that all those other constitutions and our own, there is one little difference between them—looks little, but it is so great it explains the total success of our nation. All those other constitutions are based on privileges that governments give to their people, and ours says, &#8220;We, the people will allow the Government the following rights.&#8221; And as long as it stays that way, we&#8217;re on solid ground.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Of the posts I&#8217;ve written, one of my absolute favorites had this lengthy title: <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/government-private-sector-chocolate.html">The Government, the Private Sector, Chocolate Chip Cookies, and a Flag-Waving Member of the Local Chapter of Kiwanis &#8211; an Anecdote</a>.  That post looks at one way that the private sector creates inefficiencies in the government by forcing the government to protect itself from cheating, and then blames the government for having to deal with those inefficiencies.  </p>
<p>But of course, there are other ways for the private sector to create inefficiencies in the government, and then blame the government for being inefficient.  </p>
<p><a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/02/bankers-plead-for-bailout.html">Calculated Risk</a> notes that bankers are looking for a bail-out from Uncle Sam.  <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/02/bankers-new-socialists-real-estate.html">Yves Smith</a> expands on the theme.  </p>
<p>Now, anyone who has taken an introductory microeconomics class can recognize that this sort of a bail-out creates a moral hazard &#8211; the next time around, banks know they can take massive risks because if anything goes wrong, there&#8217;s a good chance Uncle Sam will bail them out.  Heck, they might have behaved very differently in recent years, and hence avoided the current mess, but for the message sent by the various bail-outs of the past.</p>
<p>But in addition to creating the moral hazard problem, and in addition to saddling the taxpayer with the bill (but not, I might add, the earlier profits &#8211; there will be no bail-out of the profits that occurred in the run-up to this point), there is the additional problem I mentioned, which is that this process makes the US government more inefficient, by saddling it with the mess and and a designed-on-the-fly method of bail-out.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m willing to bet that it won&#8217;t be long that one of heads of one of these bailed out banks is going to be in the public eye, lecturing us about efficiency of the private sector &#8211; just like the cookie maker in earlier post.  He will be proud, he will be patriotic, and he will be convincing to many.  But what he won&#8217;t say, and what he won&#8217;t admit even to himself, is that our system would be a lot more efficient, a lot closer to something resembling the capitalist structure he so lovingly describes, if people like him were made to suffer the consequences of their actions.  And the government would be run a lot better too.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_02/013122.php">Kevin Drum</a> reminds us of a November exchange between pro-torture Mitt Romney and John McCain where McCain said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re not going to torture people. We&#8217;re not going to do what Pol Pot did. We&#8217;re not going to do what&#8217;s being done to Burmese monks as we speak.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a very principled statement – right?  Well, the Senator had the chance to support a bill that included a provision inserted by Senator Feinstein that would restrict the interrogation methods the CIA could use to the Army Field Manual, which bans waterboarding and other harsh techniques currently used by the CIA.  <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/178422.php">David Kurtz</a> follows the stunts that the Republicans used to protect McCain from the wrath of the Republican base:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans were expected to use a parliamentary procedure today that would have blocked the measure by requiring a 60-vote minimum to proceed. But here&#8217;s where it gets interesting.  Presumptive Republican nominee John McCain opposes waterboarding, which would have put him in the position of voting with the Democrats and against the President on this measure, perhaps giving the Dems the 60 votes necessary to proceed. So the Republicans scuttled that planned parliamentary maneuver, and the full bill went to a vote a little while ago, barely passing, 51-45. Notably, McCain voted against the bill.</p></blockquote>
<p>Got that?  McCain voted with the supporters of torture.  Why this hypocrisy?  Kevin reminds us of something <a href="http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2007/11/dialing_the_republicans.html">Joe Klein</a> observed during that November debate:  </p>
<blockquote><p>I attended Frank Luntz&#8217;s dial group of 30 undecided &#8211; or sort of undecided &#8211; Republicans in St. Petersburg, Florida, last night&#8230;and it was a fairly astonishing evening &#8230; But there was worse to come: When John McCain started talking about torture &#8211; specifically, about waterboarding&#8211;the dials plummeted again. Lower even than for the illegal Children of God. Down to the low 20s, which, given the natural averaging of a focus group, is about as low as you can go. Afterwards, Luntz asked the group why they seemed to be in favor of torture. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any problem pouring water on the face of a man who killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,&#8221; said John Shevlin, a retired federal law enforcement officer. The group applauded, appallingly. They also hated anything that Ron Paul said (high 30s to low 20s), especially on the war in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>This may also explain why McCain has turned into a neo-McCarthyite.  It would seem to become the GOP nominee, you have to appeal to the blood thirsty crowd. And it does seem our nation has tortured people – now with McCain’s approval.</p>

<blockquote><p>Indeed, some evidence does suggest that there are opportunities to save money and improve health through prevention. Preventable causes of death, such as tobacco smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity, and misuse of alcohol have been estimated to be responsible for 900,000 deaths annually — nearly 40% of total yearly mortality in the United States.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/7/661?query=TOC#R1">1</a> Moreover, some of the measures identified by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, such as counseling adults to quit smoking, screening for colorectal cancer, and providing influenza vaccination, reduce mortality either at low cost or at a cost savings.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/7/661?query=TOC#R2">2</a><br />Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention, however, are overreaching. Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/7/661?query=TOC#R3">3</a> For example, screening costs will exceed the savings from avoided treatment in cases in which only a very small fraction of the population would have become ill in the absence of preventive measures. Preventive measures that do not save money may or may not represent cost-effective care (i.e., good value for the resources expended). Whether any preventive measure saves money or is a reasonable investment despite adding to costs depends entirely on the particular intervention and the specific population in question. For example, drugs used to treat high cholesterol yield much greater value for the money if the targeted population is at high risk for coronary heart disease, and the efficiency of cancer screening can depend heavily on both the frequency of the screening and the level of cancer risk in the screened population.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/7/661?query=TOC#R4">4</a><br />The focus on prevention as a key source of cost savings in health care also sidesteps the question of whether such measures are generally more promising and efficient than the treatment of existing conditions. Researchers have found that although high-technology treatments for existing conditions can be expensive, such measures may, in certain circumstances, also represent an efficient use of resources.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/7/661?query=TOC#R5">5</a> It is important to analyze the costs and benefits of specific interventions.<br />A systematic review of the cost-effectiveness literature sheds light on these issues. We analyzed the contents of the Tufts–New England Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry (<a href="http://www.tufts-nemc.org/cearegistry">www.tufts-nemc.org/cearegistry</a>), which consists of detailed abstracted information on published cost-effectiveness studies through 2005. Each registry article estimates the cost-effectiveness of one or more interventions as the incremental costs (converted here to 2006 U.S. dollars) divided by the incremental health benefits quantified in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Low cost-effectiveness ratios are &#8220;favorable&#8221; because they indicate that incremental QALYs can be accrued inexpensively. An intervention is &#8220;cost-saving&#8221; if it reduces costs while improving health. Poorly performing interventions can both increase costs and worsen health.<br />Our analysis was restricted to the 599 articles (and 1500 ratios) published between 2000 and 2005 that properly discounted future costs and benefits. We classified 279 ratios as preventive because they refer to interventions designed to avert disease or injury; all 1221 other ratios pertain to treatments, a category that includes both &#8220;tertiary&#8221; measures (designed to ameliorate the effects of a disease or condition) and &#8220;secondary prevention&#8221; measures (designed to reverse or retard progression of an existing condition), such as the use of implantable cardioverter–defibrillators in patients with myocardial disease.<br />&#8230;</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that the broad generalizations made by many presidential candidates can be misleading. These statements convey the message that substantial resources can be saved through prevention. Although some preventive measures do save money, the vast majority reviewed in the health economics literature do not. Careful analysis of the costs and benefits of specific interventions, rather than broad generalizations, is critical. Such analysis could identify not only cost-saving preventive measures but also preventive measures that deliver substantial health benefits relative to their net costs; this analysis could also identify treatments that are cost-saving or highly efficient (i.e., cost-effective).<br />In addition to determining which preventive measures and treatments are most efficient, it will be necessary to identify those that are not yet fully deployed and those that could serve a large population and bring about substantial aggregate improvements in health at an acceptable cost. Findings that some cost-saving or highly efficient measures are underused would indicate that current practice is inconsistent with the efficient delivery of health care. Other services might be identified as overused, and such findings would underscore the importance of fashioning policies that provide incentives to shift practice toward more cost-effective delivery of health care. In the face of increasingly constrained resources, there is a realistic way of achieving better health results: conduct careful analysis to identify evidence-based opportunities for more efficient delivery of health care — whether prevention or treatment — and then restructure the system to create incentives that encourage the appropriate delivery of efficient interventions.</p></blockquote>
<p>To provide an anecdote to broaden the scope of this analysis, I would like to offer in the second post a story that is true and accurate. about diagnosis, costs, treatments and prevention.</p>
