                                <p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/01/looming_insolvency_of_social_s.html">Dean Baker</a> lays into Chairman Ben, President Bush, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/business/AP-Bernanke.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">this AP story</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Since the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects that Social Security can pay all future benefits for the next 39 years, with no changes whatsoever, this definitely gives new meaning to the word &#8220;looming&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;insolvency.&#8221; The real headline for this article should have been that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is apparently suggesting that the federal government default on some of the government bonds held by the Social Security trust fund. That would seem to be the implication of his suggestion that we restructure Social Security and presumably not pay the full benefits mandated under current law.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/01/bernanke_entitl_1.html">Mark Thoma</a> gently suggests the following rewrite of Chairman Ben’s speech:<br />
<blockquote>The Social Security and Medicare problems are not of the same order of magnitude. Draw a sharper distinction and make it clear that Medicare is far and away the biggest worry.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Mark is being very kind to Chairman Ben, one of his readers (billy) directs us to <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/173156">Brad Setser</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Social Security’s revenues exceed its expenditures – and will continue to do so for several years.  Its financial assets are growing – they will top $2 trillion at the end of this year.   Sure, it will need to draw on the interest on those assets in about ten year &#8211; and a few after that, it will need to tap the principal as well.  But wasn&#8217;t that the point of building up the Social Security system’s assets?  Consequently, I don’t see why 2017 is a date that causes the social security system any trouble &#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>Brad later notes in the comments:<br />
<blockquote>One part of the federal government (soc sec) set aside $10 out of its current revenue. Another part (the rest of the gov) spent $10 more than it took it. The rest of the government promised to repay social security with interest &#8230;   at some point this will simply be reversed. the rest of the government will pay Social security $10 back plus interest (or borrow the funds needed to repay social security from the private market).  The social security surplus that finances a deficit elsewhere in the government will turn into a social security deficit financed by a surplus elsewhere (or my external borrowing). Why does the internal accounting matter? Simple &#8211; different parts of the government have different revenue sources. Social security is financed by a flat payroll tax up to a cap. That&#8217;s regressive (Soc sec benefits/ insurance is, by contrast, progressive). The rest of the gov. is financed by a progressive income tax.  The increase in the regressive payroll tax to build up the trust fund (keeping the progressive income tax or the deficit lower than it otherwise would have been) only makes sense in my view if the progressive income tax is used to collect the revenue needed to pay the social security system back.  Otherwise, as Dean Baker likes to point out, all those folks who paid more soc sec payroll taxes that needed to cover current soc sec benefits will have gotten royally screwed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Workers should realize by now that this President is hell bent to royally screw them.  But why is the Federal Reserve Chairman offering this Greenspan like doublespeak.  The problem is not the Social Security benefits.  The problem started when President Bush unleashed a massive General Fund deficit with the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.</p>

<blockquote>Economists had taught me that the trade deficit is not a big deal. (The budget deficit may be a big one, but that&#8217;s a different issue.) But with all the pundits and politicians alarmed, I began to wonder if I was out of touch. Then I thought about my local supermarket. I buy stuff from the Food Emporium every week. I spend thousands of dollars a year there. But the supermarket never buys anything from me. Not one thing &#8230; Trade statistics obscure reality. Individuals exchange only when each expects to benefit. If they didn&#8217;t expect it, they wouldn&#8217;t trade. That&#8217;s true even if one party is American and the other Chinese. Trade is trade. If we don&#8217;t care about trade balances at the individual level, why does it matter if in a given year Americans as a group buy more from the Chinese than they buy from us? It doesn&#8217;t. In fact, it&#8217;s a good thing. Foreigners trade cool products (and capital goods) for paper money. They can do only three things with our dollars: buy American goods and services, save them, or invest in the United States (including buying U.S. government debt). In other words, most of what foreigners don&#8217;t spend here, they invest here. The trade deficit is mirrored by the capital-account surplus . Should we be concerned that foreigners see the U.S. economy as a good place to invest their money? I can&#8217;t see why. I think we should see it as a wonderful thing: They trust America&#8217;s future enough to invest in it. Investment creates new products and better jobs. Especially absurd is Dobbs&#8217;s idea that the trade deficit means we are in debt to foreigners. Except for the T-bills foreigners buy, this just isn&#8217;t true.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why would Dr. Mankiw want anyone to read this nonsense?  To the degree that Stossel is saying don’t listen to trade protectionist such as Lou Dobbs and Pat Buchanan – great!  And his grocery store analogy is essentially saying that bilateral trade balances are rather meaningless.  If the U.S. had a trade surplus with Europe equal to its trade deficit with Asia, I’d see his point.  But we seem to have a trade deficit with almost every nation.  </p>
<p>Stossel argues we should be concerned with government deficits but we should not be concerned when the Chinese are buying investment goods from U.S. producers.  But might someone inform Mr. Stossel of the facts.  Investment demand in the U.S. is not high.  No, we have a very low national savings rate.  And the Chinese are buying U.S. government bonds.  Stossel wants to pretend that we are not running up debt.  He wants to pretend that the U.S. is creating all sorts of new net wealth.  If Stossel really believes what he wrote, then is very ignorant of the data.  Greg Mankiw is not – so why did he asked us to read Stossel?</p>

                                <p>GW has already said Iraq is a different kind of war&#8230; there will be no surrender at the end of it.  (Maybe that&#8217;s a good thing &#8211; one can only imagine the signing statement he&#8217;d put on a surrender document.)  The definition of victory in Iraq changed a few times&#8230; now its seems to be getting the Iraqi military to the point where they can take over the fight against the enemy (and who the enemy might be is equally unclear to the administration) allowing US troops to come home</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/9659.html">Steve Benen</a>, <a href="http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=35882&#038;dcn=todaysnews">we learn</a></p>
<p>&#8220;[t]he Defense Department has resisted auditors’ efforts to obtain data on the military readiness of U.S.-trained Iraqi troops.</p>
<p>Comptroller General David M. Walker told audience members at a Government Executive breakfast Wednesday that Defense has not complied with repeated Government Accountability Office requests for evaluations of Iraqi troop preparedness, known as transitional readiness assessments. The Pentagon develops those evaluations for Iraqi and U.S. forces, Walker said, and has a statutory obligation to release them to GAO. </p>
<p>“We’ve received high-level briefings that are helpful, but not adequate,” Walker said. He said he has yet to see the requested information, but Defense Deputy Secretary Gordon England has agreed in principle to turn it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, </p>
<p>&#8220;Walker said he expected to find some embarrassing information that would account for the battle over obtaining them. &#8220;You just can&#8217;t go by how many people you trained,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Of the people that you&#8217;ve trained, how many are left? To what extent do they have loyalty to the unified government of Iraq? To what extent are they properly equipped? To what extent do they have appropriate support?&#8221; &#8220;</p>
<p>And, </p>
<p>&#8220;The most recent attack data, released as part of GAO&#8217;s report this month on key issues for Iraq-related congressional oversight, showed that attacks on Iraqi security forces, Iraqi civilians and coalition forces have followed a wavering upward trend since early 2003, reaching a total of between 5,000 and 6,000 in October 2006. The majority of those were on coalition forces, according to the data. </p>
<p>The report also showed that roughly 300,000 Iraqi security forces have been trained and equipped to date, and that about 80 Iraqi army battalions are leading counterinsurgency operations. The readiness assessments would lend additional insight into those figures. &#8220;</p>
<p>GW has said the surge will work because it has to work.  Since the moving goalposts are no longer credible, what&#8217;s to keep them from simply declaring victory and going home?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I don’t really have time to flesh this out right now, and I’m doing this on the fly, but I was thinking of the disparity between the pay of top managers and line level employees.  We’ve all seen the statistics, and heard the arguments from all sides, so I won’t rehash any of them.  My thought, which for all I know is not original, there are five options:</p>
<p>1.  The earlier pay disparity made more sense<br />2.  The current pay disparity makes more sense<br />3.  The earlier pay disparity makes more sense now, and the current pay disparity would have been more appropriate to use back then<br />4.  The earlier pay disparity made sense back then, and the current pay disparity makes more sense now.<br />5.  Neither pay disparity makes more sense, in the sense that neither has much of an effect on real outcomes</p>
<p>I’m going to dispense with number 3.  I don’t think anyone believes that one.  So we’re left with 1, 2, 4 and 5.  While economic conditions change, its management’s job to impose some vision on companies, if need be, even moving the company out of one industry and into another.  Should we, therefore, expect that on average (and perhaps even at an individual company level), over a reasonably long period (ten years, twenty?) to smooth out any short term fluctuations, </p>
<p>a.  If 1 is true, then profit margins were higher back then<br />b.  If 2 is true, then profit margins are higher now<br />c.  If either 4 or 5 are true, then profit margins are about the same</p>
<p>So how do we break apart option c?  Off the top of my head, I’d guess that if pay disparities are important to firm performance at this time, we would see companies with the greatest pay disparities (as a share of the company’s profit?) between management and line workers doing better at this time than others.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s as far as I got right at this moment.  Your thoughts?</p>

                                <p>With hat tip to <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/lying_in_politics_/2007/01/budget_nonsense_from_right_blogistan.php">Mark Kleiman</a>, let’s check out why <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives2/2007/01/post_1776.php">Glenn Reynolds</a> believes that the Federal budget will be balanced by the middle of next year.  Glenn has been reading <a href="http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2007/01/balanced_budget.html">Skeptical Optimist</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Tax receipts are continuing to grow significantly faster than spending, according to the Monthly Treasury Statement As a result, if these trends continue, the budget will move into balance on July 3, 2008.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that’s being an optimist.  Mark is more skeptical noting that this retired businessman has taken noise in the data and converted it to some linear extrapolation:<br />
<blockquote>He doesn&#8217;t even say it&#8217;s going to happen, only that it would happen if current trends were to continue. In other words, it&#8217;s complete garbage. And Glenn doesn&#8217;t believe it himself, except in an Orwellian way.</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone call the National Review as I think the Skeptical Optimist can help with the next Fuzzchart!</p>

<blockquote>When Congress amended the Higher Education Act 10 years ago, defaulted student loans became the easiest and most lucrative debt to issue and collect. The amendments imposed huge fees on defaulted student loans and took away bankruptcy protection for student borrowers. It banned refinancing of many student loans, and also allowed draconian collection measures to be taken against student borrowers, including wage garnishment, tax garnishment, withholding of professional certifications, termination from employment, and even Social Security garnishment. Harvard Professor Elizabeth Warren told The Wall Street Journal that &#8220;student loan debt collectors have power that would make a mobster envious.&#8221; And no one makes the mobsters greener than Al Lord and his Student Loan Marketing Corporation, also known as Sallie Mae.</p></blockquote>
<p>One would think that low default risk would translate into low interest rates in a competitive market.  But Mr. Collinge, who is the founder of Student Loan Justice – suggests this market is not all that competitive:<br />
<blockquote>In the company&#8217;s annual report, Lord attributed his company&#8217;s 29% core cash earnings-per-share growth in large part to fees collected from defaulted loans. He forgot to mention that the law allowed him to forbid Sallie&#8217;s customers from refinancing with competitors offering better deals. Meanwhile, the borrowers suffer. Many student loan debtors in default find themselves unable to function in society, and are faced with a decision to either continue the paralysis and live in fear, or begin making payments on a massively inflated amount &#8211; often double, triple or quadruple what they originally borrowed. StudentLoanJustice.Org has received thousands of stories from citizens whose lives have been shattered by their student loans. People who default on student loans are typically decent citizens who, for one reason or another, were not able to capitalize on their education. Most agree that they are responsible to pay back what they borrowed, but most cannot afford to pay back the wildly increased amounts that the federal law has allowed to be imposed upon them. The student loan system in the U.S. has been hijacked by Albert Lord and his friends. Let there be no mistake: These are not creative geniuses who invented a new product or service. These are not captains of industry who built markets and competed their way to the top. Rather, these are nothing more than well-connected executives who took an existing market and used their weight in Congress to erect insurmountable barriers to competition. Here are just two examples: Sallie Mae convinced Congress that allowing borrowers to reconsolidate student loans would cost taxpayers money, so they banned it. Then they sidestepped the law against inducements (also known as kickbacks) by permitting Sallie Mae to loan schools money to make student loans in the school&#8217;s name, then sell them to Sallie Mae for a &#8220;commission.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Collinge is suggesting that these firms got Congress to tilt the market place in their favor and against the interests of those who have taken out student loans.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/01/welfare_for_small_business_own.html#015153">Dean Baker</a> continues his discussion of welfare for the rich<br />
<blockquote>In many cases, these businesses are extremely poor credit risks, so a 4 percent interest rate would be at least 4 percentage points lower than what they would pay in the private sector. Assuming that the subsidy is 4 percentage points, this implies a maximum of $60,000 a year in subsidies, that could last as long as 30 years. (Contrast this with TANF cash payments that average around $6,000 a year and have a maximum duration of 5 years.) I don&#8217;t have anything against small businesses, but the idea that these folks are free marketers is nonsense. They get serious subsidies and this should be made clear in discussing their benefits. It&#8217;s not obvious that it&#8217;s better to hand a small business owner $60,000 than to give child care subsidies for 20 kids.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if take out a student loan, Congress can tilt the bankruptcy rules so default is very difficult and the White House wants no government provided subsidies.  But if you start a small business, you get bankruptcy protection and an interest rate subsidy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maliki disputed President Bush&#8217;s remarks broadcast Tuesday that the execution of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein &#8220;looked like it was kind of a revenge killing&#8221; and took exception to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice&#8217;s Senate testimony last week that Maliki&#8217;s administration was on &#8220;borrowed time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prime minister said statements such as Rice&#8217;s &#8220;give morale boosts for the terrorists and push them toward making an extra effort and making them believe they have defeated the American administration,&#8221; Maliki said. &#8220;But I can tell you that they have not defeated the Iraqi government.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not that Maliki is trustworthy either, but its hard to understand how GW can&#8217;t step back and realize he&#8217;s done more to help Bin Laden&#8217;s cause than even Bin Laden.</p>

                                <p>This post is by Angry Bear regular Divorced One Like Bush.  I have to apologize to the reader and DolB since the post involves graphs and I haven&#8217;t gotten them looking quite right.  Any screw-ups are mine.  You may want to contact DolB directly for a better look at the graphs&#8230; his address is the letter d followed by the letter j followed by becker (all as one word) at cox dot net.)</p>
<p>First, I want to thank PGL and cactus for letting me present an idea at the Angry Bear.  Second, let me say that I&#8217;m not an economist.  I don&#8217;t even play one.  Although I did have one course in college. The following is based on data from 360Data.org and the BEA.</p>
<p>The more I&#8217;ve been looking at trends since 1947 to 2005, I am thinking this issue of tax rates on income is missing the boat.   </p>
<p>Up until around 1966, net dividends, consumption of fixed capital, fed income taxes, non residential investment and undistributed profits rise in parallel to the CPI.  </p>
<p>After 1966,  fed income taxes and consumption of fixed capital (depreciation) start rising faster and accelerates after 1981.  In 1981/82 depreciation rises above income taxes and stays there until 1987.  This is the first time it has happened.   It does this again from 1990 to 1995/96 at which time taxes stay above and rise faster than the depreciation until 2000/01 when it falls to 97/98 levels.  However, depreciation continues to rise.</p>
<p>Against the GDP, depreciation and taxes start to close the gap of slope  in 1974.  The GDP slope declines and the other two increase so that all 3 are at there closest in 2001.  However, depreciation gets closest to GDP in 2005.   All 3 are rising much faster than CPI.</p>
<p>Around 1975, undistributed profits and nonresidential investment start rising faster than CPI.  Net Dividends parallels the CPI.  In 79/80 dividends dives below CPI but investment continues to rise.  By 87/88 dividends are rising over the CPI,  and parallels the rise of taxes to 2005.  Investment falls below CPI 91/93 then rises rapidly until a 2000 decline to below CPI  in 2002 and rises to cross above in 03.  Undistributed profits remains below CPI from 81 to 94.  By 98 it is below CPI again, until it starts it&#8217;s rise in 01 to going almost vertical in 02.</p>
<p>I have noted the dramatic change in personal vs corporate tax ratios after 1981 changing form 1.9/1 to 4.67/1.  A graphs of GDP % changes shows a reduction in the rise at 1981 to ½ that of pre 1981.   The change in exports matches the GDP.  If you chart the change in the % of income for the top 1 percent from 1947 to 2005 it declines from 12.24% in 48 to 8.86 in 1976.  It rises to 10.02 in 1981 and then rises to 21.52 in 2000.  This curve  (stacked) matches exactly the rise in the S &#038; P 500 from 47 to 05.  It&#8217;s acceleration starts in 1981 and goes almost vertical in 1994.</p>
<p>So, what do I get from this?  That this nation has changed it&#8217;s focus as to how to make this nation earn money.  It changed it&#8217;s focus to capital and only capital and this change   has been implemented in stages.   The closing of the gap between GDP, Fed Income taxes and depreciation and pull away from the CPI, investment, dividends, and undistributed profit with the start of the biggest split being 1981 can only mean we changed our thinking.  And it happened with the “Reagan revolution” tax changes.  I have noted at this site that I believe the tax code changes in effect changed labor from an asset to a liability.  It is part of the focus change to capital only.</p>
<p>We gave away revenue in the form of depreciation tax schedules as the first implementation of the focus.  That the tax and depreciation alternate after 1981 and coincides with the tax bills can not be coincident.  That we see a mix of activity in the investment, undistributed profits and dividends after this time that is not evident in the pre 81 period also shows that we have changed our focus.  As mentioned, there is a continual, accelerated rise in dividends after 1987.  This was the second part of the  implementation.  Now most recently,  undistributed profit shows a major rise from 2002, quadrupling.</p>
<p>We have changed in this country, and it is not a change keeping with the premise of the writers of our constitution.  At the same time, I believe the rich will find they have traded quick money for long term security.</p>
<p>I believe this change of thinking is why this country can no longer solve problems as in the past.  We focus on the short term gain (as reflected in our tax policies) and not the long term resolution.  Finally, if we are going to solve the tax rate issue, then we better start looking at not only personal rates, but the total relief of taxes on capital.</p>

                                <p>Our friend <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2007/01/index.html#000759">Bill Polley</a> reads <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2007/01/should_scarcity.html">Michael Mandel</a> and follows up on the question:<br />
<blockquote>Should &#8216;Scarcity&#8217; Be Part of the Definition of Economics</p></blockquote>
<p>Mandel reviews textbooks that talk about behavior and choices and then writes:<br />
<blockquote>My justification for a different definition is that there are big chunks of the economy where scarcity is not important</p></blockquote>
<p>I just lost it when I read this and here was my reply:<br />
<blockquote>I keep saying that the foundation of economics is the Law of Scarcity and now Mandel says forgot all of that. Therein lies my problem with most of his writing. But OK, we talk about people&#8217;s choices. But why do I have to choice. Ah, scarcity. It&#8217;s called Constrained Optimization. Of course, some free lunch types (Lawrence Kudlow, Thomas Sowell when he discusses macroeconomics, and yes &#8211; Michael Mandel) want us to ignore the constrained. Fine &#8211; I choose to consume more of everything. I guess now George W. Bush can hire me as his next head of the CEA!</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe <a href="http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell111705.asp">Thomas Sowell</a> can teach Mandel about the Lure of the Free Lunch – when Sowell is not guilty of practicing <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/lure-of-free-lunch.html">free lunch economics</a>.</p>

That said, its warmer than in the past few days, and I recognize some of you elsewhere in the northern hemisphere must be wondering what I&#8217;m complaining about.
