<blockquote>Yet the letter comes amid renewed calls by some, including former national security adviser Samuel Berger and Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE), to reengage directly with Iran&#8217;s government to defuse the crisis by diplomatic means. &#8220;The continued unwillingness of the U.S. to engage Iran will make other [UN Security Council] states hesitate to support, and possibly oppose&#8221; stricter actions like sanctions, Hagel wrote in the Financial Times. </p></blockquote>

<p>Alas, the main reason for Lionel’s post has to do with President Bush ignoring President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s letter for a diplomatic resolution to our differences.  As <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iran9may09,0,3215039.story?coll=la-home-headlines">Maggie Farley and Paul Richter</a> note:<br />
<blockquote>Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent an unexpected letter to President Bush on Monday, in what was seen as an overture for direct talks about Tehran&#8217;s nuclear program, but U.S. officials dismissed the missive as an eleventh-hour ploy to forestall punitive action by the United Nations &#8230; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told the Associated Press that the letter did not contain serious proposals on the disputed nuclear program, but covered history, philosophy and religion over 17 or 18 pages.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>A ploy?</strong>  Get ready folks – the neocons running our military seem to want a war with Iran.  After all, Karl Rove has to do something to win the 2006 elections.  I just hope the grownups in the GOP join Senator Hagel in speaking out.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YzYwY2U2ZGRlMWM5MDFlNzJiNGI5OTUwYjI4YzgyYzg=">Michael Darda</a> wants to do some Bush cheerleading and dips into the Kudlow file of nonsensical concepts:<br />
<blockquote>The growth of consumption plus investment (core GDP) advanced at a torrid 6.2 percent annual rate during the first quarter in real terms while nominal core GDP galloped at a 9.5 percent annual rate, the best showing since the first quarter of 2000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though Darda later worries about inflation – he decides to tout the growth in nominal “core GDP”.  As far as his real core GDP, I have several questions.  The first is how did he come up with 6.2% as when I sum consumption and investment (total including inventory accumulation), it seems to have grown by a 5.6% annual rate during 2006QI.  More fundamentally, why would he and Kudlow want to exclude net exports from their calculations?  I would also challenge the notion that government purchases should be excluded from these calculations, but notice something.  Real government purchases rose by just under a 4% annual rate.</p>
<p>So what is really going on here?  Darda writes:<br />
<blockquote>Real exports of goods and services advanced at a 12.1 percent annual rate during the first three months of the year after a 5.1 percent increase during the fourth quarter. This was the fastest quarterly rate of increase since the last quarter of 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>Darda omits the fact that imports grew more than exports.  So the real reason Darda and Kudlow omit net exports from core GDP is that they don’t want to admit to their readers that the current account deficit has grown.</p>

<p>The graph shows private spending (consumption + investment + net exports) as a share of GDP from 2000QI to 2006QI.  The suggestion from Darda and Kudlow that private spending growth exceeded overall growth is both false and also contradictory to the claim of certain small government conservatives that Bush has somehow been a liberal.  The decline in the private spending/GDP ratio from around 82.5% in 2000 to 81% today is simply the flip side of the increase in government purchases, which were running about 17.5% of GDP in 2000 and are now up to 19%.  As Kudlow once tried to argue – Bush has not cut government spending “Reagan style”.  Then again – neither did President Reagan.  Of course in the 1980’s, some conservatives blamed the Reagan deficits on exploding government spending, while some conservatives today claim Reagan succeeded in small government conservatism.  Of course, anyone would bothers to review the historical record realizes that government spending as a share of GDP neither rose nor fell appreciably in the 1980’s either.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.janegalt.net/blog/archives/005766.html">Jane Galt</a> takes <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/05/framing-and-progressivity.html">Greg Mankiw</a> to school on fiscal policy:<br />
<blockquote>There are four ways that I can think of for the US to deal with its debt burden: 1) Raise taxes to pay it off. </p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, she started off praising Dr. Mankiw’s discussion of an op-ed from <a href="http://public.wsj.com/marketing/openhouse/welcome.html?oreq=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114705083956846285.html%3Fmod=opinion_main_commentaries">Edward Lazear and Katherine Baicker</a> where it was claimed:<br />
<blockquote>The president&#8217;s tax cuts have made the tax code more progressive</p></blockquote>
<p>Jane’s point was made by <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/6-2-04tax.htm">William G. Gale, Peter R. Orszag, and Isaac Shapiro</a> who wrote:<br />
<blockquote>Popular discussions about the advisability of recent tax cuts have frequently ignored a simple truism:  someone, somewhere, at some time will have to pay for them.  The payment may be in the form of increases in other taxes, reductions in government programs, or some combination of the two; the payment may occur now or later; it may be transparent or hidden.  But iron laws of arithmetic and fiscal solvency tell us that the payment has to occur.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jane continued:<br />
<blockquote>This will be a burden on America&#8217;s relatively poorer members only to the extent that the tax burden falls on them. But while overall withholdings are only very mildly progressive in America (thanks to Social Security payments), income tax is extremely progressive; the effective federal tax burden on someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger is roughly 30%, while a median-income family of four pays less than 8% of its income to the federal tax</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr Gale et al., however, wrote:<br />
<blockquote>The tax cuts are often portrayed by their supporters as painless and simply “giving people their money back.”  But the numbers presented above indicate that the substantial majority of American households ultimately will be made worse off by the tax cuts, because the tax cuts ultimately will have to be financed.  Different methods of financing would generate variation in the particular results, but this basic finding that most households end up being worse off is likely to continue to hold unless a significant portion of the tax cuts themselves are repealed.  The reason is that the tax cuts scale back (or even eliminate) many of the most progressive elements of the federal tax system, including the estate tax, the taxation of capital gains and dividends, the top income tax rates, and the phase-outs of certain exemptions and deductions for households with high incomes.  It is unlikely that any method of financing those changes, other than repeal, will be as progressive as the tax provisions that have been scaled back.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Dr. Gale et al. presented their assumptions and detailed reasoning, we will have to wait Jane’s more detailed analysis.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/05/various-items_04.html">Glenn Greenwald</a> is certainly correct:<br />
<blockquote>Notwithstanding the fact that the Bush administration has violated every tenet of this strain of conservatism for the last five years, conservatives will not be permitted to distance themselves from this administration &#8212; as they are transparently and pitifully trying to do now that Bush&#8217;s presidency is failed and is dying a rapid death (see e.g., this characteristically dishonest attempt by Jonah Goldberg to characterize the two failed Republican Presidents &#8211; Nixon and Bush &#8211; as &#8220;liberals&#8221; in order to imply that their failure is not a failure of conservatives; funny how we never heard any of that when The Commander had approval ratings in the 60s). With rare and noble exception, conservatives did not repudiate Bush until very recently. To the contrary, they have vigorously supported and claimed him (while he was popular), and he is their creation. They are and should be stuck with him.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice in particular this passage from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWU2NTMzOWUzMzNhMmZjYzU2YmUzY2JmYmYzOTU5Zjg=">Jonah Goldberg</a>: <br />
<blockquote>I could argue that Nixon&#8217;s amoral foreign policy is today alive and well in many corners of the Left, but that&#8217;s a distraction from my central point. Bush is certainly to the right of Nixon on many issues. But at the philosophical level, he shares the Nixonians&#8217; supreme confidence in the power of the state. Bush rejects limited government and many of the philosophical assumptions that underlie that position. He favors instead strong government.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it would be tempting to slam Mr. Goldberg for that cheap shot at liberals where he suggests we are Nixonian, let me agree with his assertion that Bush is a lot like Nixon in advocating the supremacy of the Executive Branch even so far as to violate with impunity the civil rights of citizens and to trash the career of a CIA agent simply for partisan purposes.  Oh wait, the National Review defends this White House in PlameGate.  </p>
<p>But let me thank certain Republican leaders for having the same concern with the appointment of General Hayden to head the CIA as I do.  But guess what – the <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MjJlY2ZhNzZkNThhODg0YTVjNTk0MzkxMWU5ZDQ2YjE=">National Review</a> is supporting this nomination:<br />
<blockquote>The reasons for Porter Goss’s abrupt departure as CIA director are shrouded in mystery. But its effect is not. It gives the impression that there has been a coup by the CIA insiders who have waged a covert policy war against the Bush administration for five years. The White House must act quickly to correct the impression that the renegades have won. The CIA is supposed to work for the president.</p></blockquote>
<p>The NRO editors have the gall to suggest that the CIA has been working for the Democratic Party.  When they say the CIA is supposed to work for the President – I guess they envision a CIA on par with their own partisan hackery.  Too bad they cannot understand that some of us want a CIA to work for the American people.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/node/29634">Matthew Yglesias</a> has more, but neither he nor I went after this:<br />
<blockquote>When the administration posed questions in 2002 about intelligence reports that Saddam Hussein had sought uranium yellowcake (a potential nuclear precursor) in Niger, Valerie Plame Wilson, a CIA analyst who thought these reports were “crazy,” helped arrange to have her husband, former ambassador Joseph Wilson, sent on a CIA fact-finding mission. Though the assignment was classified, the CIA permitted Wilson to author a New York Times op-ed ripping the administration for purportedly misstating intelligence in the run-up to the war and suggesting—disingenuously, it turned out—that Joseph Wilson had found no evidence that Iraq had sought uranium from Niger. A coterie of current and former agency officers demanded the prosecution of administration officials when Plame’s status as a CIA employee—a matter that appears to have been widely known, and whose leak caused no damage to national security—was mentioned in the media.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hopefully, <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/">FDL</a> will rip into these liars at the National Review!</p>

                                <p>While the folks over at the National Review have nothing but praise for a book written by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596980044/ref=ase_httpwwwandrec-20/102-8664038-4105735?n=283155&#038;tagActionCode=httpwwwandrec-20">RameshPonnuru</a>, <a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/05/ramesh_coulter_.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> (to his credit) has been criticizing what appears to be a partisan cheap shot.  <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NjUzNDdmNTAzOTMwNzQ1NDFlNGZkZDBjZjdkNTA5MmQ=">Jonah Goldberg</a> is upset with Sulli and offers this advice:<br />
<blockquote>maybe Andrew Sullivan could simply take a few extra minutes and actually read Ramesh&#8217;s book.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know, I know – Goldberg is not exactly known to read books he has been asked to review, but just consider the Sulli post that Goldberg referred to.  As of <a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/04/ramesh_coulter.html">April 26</a>, Sulli had admitted that he had not read the book entitled <em>The Party of Death: The Democrats, the Media, the Courts, and the Disregard for Human Life</em>. Sulli had read KLo claiming this book was not a partisan attack and decided to read at least a portion of the book where we read:<br />
<blockquote>Is the Democratic Party the &#8220;Party of Death&#8221;? If you look at their agenda they are.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Sulli has at least started to read this pathetic smear on my party.  But if Mr. Goldberg and KLo don’t realize that is an attack on the Democratic Party, I have to wonder if they have even read the title. </p>
<p>By the way, I have not bothered to read even one page of any of Ann Coulter’s books.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Does <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OWRjN2FkMDkyNGE3YmZmZWEyY2ZmZGRlZDZlM2IwMmY=">Jonah Goldberg</a> read anything?<br />
<blockquote>It seems to me that conservatives are going to have to respond to Jonathan Rauch&#8217;s argument in the new Atlantic &#8230; <strong>Me</strong>: One point which seems worth raising is that the key to this argument is that saying tax cuts don&#8217;t pay for themselves is different than saying tax cuts don&#8217;t result in increased revenue. This, it seems to me, is central to most conservative arguments for cutting taxes. The growth in spending Niskanen (an objectively credible voice, I should add) identifies is probably attributable to several factors &#8211; some of them noted by Mallaby &#8211; but one of them may be an increase in revenues. Anyway, I need to read the Rauch piece and there are others better qualified to deal with the economic issues. But if tax increases can be demonstrated to shrink government in some significant way, I&#8217;m certainly open to them. But there are way to many ifs and buts built into that hypothetical to deal with here and now. </p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, I wish he’d drop that childish habit of starting his uninformed opinion with “ME”.  Secondly, Rauch’s piece was not particularly long so he might have been able to read it in approximately the same amount of time that it would take Andrew Sullivan to read an entire book.  </p>
<p>But let me make this really simple for the very slow Jonah Goldberg.  Government spending as a share of GDP did not decline during the Reagan years and went up during the Bush43 years, which was Niskanen’s point.  Of course, this historical data has been clear to anyone who has bothered to follow anything in this debate.</p>
<p>As far as some supply-side effect, the reduction in national savings and investment from the Reagan and Bush43 tax cuts LOWERED economic growth so as Mr. Goldberg starts his babble trying to hold out hope for a Laffer curve increase in revenues from tax rate reductions, he shows he knows not a single thing about this issue.  <br />But when did incredible ignorance ever prevent Mr. Goldberg for opining on things he has no time to research?</p>

<blockquote>An industry-wide study in the late 1990s showed that oil industry profits amounted to an estimated 7.3 cents on each gallon sold. More recently, ConocoPhillips reported that during the third quarter of 2005 earnings from its U.S. refining and marketing operations amounted to 9 cents per gallon. This compares with a national average retail price of $2.60 per gallon during the third quarter, the period of highest gasoline prices in 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>This statement does not say that Big Oil earns only $0.09 per gallon because much of the profits from a vertically integrated oil supplier come from its ownership of crude oil reserves, which are currently generating substantial economic rents.</p>
<p>In the ConocoPhillips link, you may have noticed that gasoline pump, which can also be found <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gasdiesel.asp">here</a>. EIA also provides this breakdown monthly from January 2000 to March 2006.  Distribution and marketing accounted for 4.5% of the reported $2.425 per gallon figure for March or almost $0.11 per gallon, while refining accounted for 21.7% or almost $0.53 per gallon.  So how did $0.64 per gallon become only $0.09 per gallon.  Perhaps because the EIA figures are the gross profits versus what ConocoPhillips is suggesting as operating profits.  </p>
<p>Of course, the rightwinger arguments are contradictory in this regard.  Rightwingers love to tell us that it is the lack of refinery capacity that is to blame for the high gasoline prices as if the refineries are collecting a lot of economic rent.  But then Rush tells us that these entities are not making very much in profits.  Clearly Rush is too eager to parrot what industry spokesman tell him without even bothering to understand the basic accounting issues. </p>
<p>Further down, the ConocoPhillips discussion compared operating profit margins to operating profit margins in other sectors:<br />
<blockquote>For example, a software company that clears $90 million in net income on product sales of $1 billion would earn a profit margin of 9 percent or 9 cents on each dollar of sales. Traditionally, oil companies have trailed many other industries in this measure of profitability. As indicated in the graphic, the profit margin of oil and natural gas companies was slightly above that of all industry in the third quarter of 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>A software company that has an operating margin of only 9%?  This can’t be Microsoft as its 2005 operating margin was almost 37%.  The operating margin for <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1163165/000110465906012015/0001104659-06-012015-index.htm">ConocoPhillips</a> in 2005 was over 13%, while the operating margin for <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000119312506040951/0001193125-06-040951-index.htm">Exxon</a> in 2005 was over 16%.  While we are talking about Exxon, let’s check out what <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=14488">Jack Kemp</a> is arguing:<br />
<blockquote>The retail market is competitive, and Exxon, for example, is but one-tenth of the total U.S. market.  They get a 7 percent to 8 percent return on investment and face a 45 percent to 46 percent marginal tax rate on corporate income.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exxon’s 2005 10-K reports only a 41% effective tax rate, but its reported return to capital is 31% not 8%.  Of course, Exxon is much more than a retailer given that not only refines oil into gasoline but also owns much of the oil that it utilizes.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the EIA figures to note that crude oil’s contribution to the price of gasoline in March 2006 was 54.8% or $1.33 per gallon.  Owners of crude oil – such as those OPEC nations – are earning very high economic rents.  I have to wonder if Mr. Limbaugh and Mr. Kemp understand the simple fact that part of the accounting profits for companies like Exxon are attributable to this economic rent from owning oil fields.  If we turn to page 54 of ConocoPhillips 10-K, which allocates income by each business segment, we that income from exploitation and production accounted for $8.43 billion out of $13.53 billion of total income.  And yet, Rush fails to include the lion’s share of their profits in his spin.</p>
<p>Unocal, which was predominately doing oil exploration and production before it was acquired, filed its last 10-K for fiscal year ended <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/716039/000119312505044680/0001193125-05-044680-index.htm">12/31/2004</a> and reported operating profits that exceeded 24% of its revenue even after deducting depletion, depreciation, and amortization expenses, which exceeded 12% of its revenue.</p>
<p>As much as Arlen Specter wants to impose anti-trust legislation upon Iran and Saudi Arabia, we as a nation really can’t.  Some liberals have suggested we resort to price controls to limit oil company profits, which would be an awful idea.  While I have suggested we tax some of the economic rent received on extraction of crude oil by companies like Exxon (or the former Unocal), other economists have disagreed with me.  But to suggest Big Oil is not making significant profits is certainly fuzzy accounting.</p>

<p>Incidentally, one of Max’s readers pointed out <a href="http://yellowdogdems.blogspot.com/2005/08/big-oil-isnt-interested-in-anwr-but.html">this story</a> regarding ANWR:<br />
<blockquote>Big oil has stated that they are simply not interested in drilling in ANWR.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if Exxon et al. were interested in drilling in ANWR – I seriously doubt we would get nearly as much oil from there as from Saudi Arabia.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Employment Situation Summary</a> for April 2006 reports that employment per the payroll survey rose by 138,000.  The household survey shows an increase of only 47,000.  I wish I had better new for this Cinco de Mayo.  </p>
<p>I also want to know what the heck <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/05/news/economy/jobs_april/index.htm?cnn=yes">CNN</a> means by this:<br />
<blockquote>But the report had one reading that might be of concern to the Fed &#8211; average wages rose more than expected. The average hourly wage was up 9 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $16.61. Economists had forecast only a 0.3 percent rise after.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess these folks can’t stand the possibility that real wages might one day recover.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_05/008744.php">Kevin Drum</a> reads the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/04/AR2006050402063.html">Washington Post</a> also getting alarmed that real compensation might have increased. The WaPo’s evidence?<br />
<blockquote>But the slack that typified the nation&#8217;s labor market from 2001 until last year appears to have dissipated, and wages are starting to rise.  This tightening in the labor market was underscored yesterday by new government data. For most of the past five years, workers&#8217; productivity has risen faster than their compensation. But in the first quarter, the value of pay and benefits for workers rose at a 3.6 percent inflation-adjusted annual pace, as their productivity rose only 3.2 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later in this story, we read:<br />
<blockquote>Wages for nonsupervisory workers rose 3.4 percent in the year ended in March, notes Economic Policy Institute Senior Economist Jared Bernstein. That&#8217;s less than consumer prices rose over that period, but mainly because of the sharp increase in energy prices in that span. In the year ended in March 2004, wages rose only 2.6 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls in 1982$ was $8.30 as of July 2003 but was only $8.19 as of March 2006.</p>
<p>But back to Kevin:<br />
<blockquote>Even the slightest indication that workers might be gaining back some of the losses of the past five years is enough to send America&#8217;s economic elite into a tizzy. It&#8217;s funny that a 30% increase in CEO pay doesn&#8217;t seem to have the same effect, though, isn&#8217;t it?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/05/are-wages-rising.html">Dean Baker</a> notes the divergent signals on whether real compensation is rising or falling:<br />
<blockquote>Last Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released the employment cost index (ECI) which showed a sharp slowing in the rate of nominal hourly compensation growth in the first quarter to an annual rate of just 2.4 percent. This is well below the rate of inflation, which, depending on the course of gas prices, will be in the range of 3.0-4.0 percent for this year. On Thursday, BLS released productivity data, which showed that hourly compensation was rising at an annual rate of 5.7 percent for the same quarter. Further complicating the picture is the employment report that BLS released this morning showing wages rising at a 4.7 percent annual rate over the most recent three months (compared to the prior 3-month average).</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean tries to explain what is going on with this data with the basic message being that while the growth in benefits has slowed, wage growth has accelerated.</p>

<blockquote>I&#8217;m going to use a number here because I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s applicable to somebody out there. Let&#8217;s say a tank full of gasoline costs you $55. Here&#8217;s the question. If Big Oil did not take one cent in profit, what would that $55 tank full of gas cost you? The profit is 9¢ per gallon. So if Big Oil didn&#8217;t take 1¢ in profit, a $55 tank full of gas would cost you $50, twice what people want to pay at 25 bucks a fill-up. So if Big Oil, the robber barons, don&#8217;t take any profit, a $55 fill-up is still going to cost you $50, and when there was no profit, if we were to pull this off, if there were no profit and a $55 tank full costs somebody 50, who would the liberals blame then? </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002182.html">Max Sawicky</a> listens, falls out of his chair laughing, but then gets up to write:<br />
<blockquote>If profit is 9 cents a gallon (bullshit, but let&#8217;s try and follow the logic) and zero profit saved you $5, by advanced mathematics it means you have a fifty-five gallon tank.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hold the phone as my mathematics may not be up to Rush’s, but if he can purchase 55 gallons of gasoline for only $55 – I want to know where he fills up!</p>
<p>Also – Max has a <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002181.html">request</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;ve started to collect ignorant statements from prominent people purporting to explain the price spikes in oil and gas. If you want to help, in the comments post the howlers you have heard from people like Limbaugh, Hannity, etc. It will help me prepare a fact check. Provide sources, links, etc. to the extent possible, and keep it pithy. Statements from liberals and Dems welcome as well. I&#8217;m interested in obvious misstatements of fact, not stuff requiring some deep analysis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Please help Max, but as you do, follow his reasonable set of instructions as his comment box is likely to be very crowded.</p>
