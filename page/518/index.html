<p>Tries to answer.</p>
<p>Drum <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2008/11/taxes_and_christina_romer.html">summarizes</a> better than Waldmann</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year Christina and David Romer wrote a paper that attempted to quantify the effect of tax changes on economic growth. I read it at the time and didn&#8217;t understand it. I read it again a few minutes ago and I still don&#8217;t understand it. So my question is: Can you please explain your paper titled &#8220;The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks&#8221;?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my understanding of what the paper says. Basically, the Romers looked at every tax measure enacted since 1945 and classified them into two groups. The first group they call endogenous. These are tax changes made in response to current or future economic conditions, including responses to spending changes or recessions. Since the effect of these tax changes is difficult to separate from the effects of the events being responded to, they are discarded.</p>
<p>The second group they call exogenous. These are tax changes designed either to reduce a deficit or to raise long-term growth. Since they aren&#8217;t motivated by current or future economic conditions, their effect on the economy is untainted by external factors.</p>
<p>The Romers use this second group to calculate the effect of tax changes on economic growth without confounding factors, and their conclusion is that a tax increase of 1% of GDP reduces output three years later by nearly 3%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then he says he doesn&#8217;t trust any methodology based on interpreting what people say &#8212; too subjective.</p>
<p>He also asks</p>
<blockquote><p>Fifth, can it really be true that a 1% tax increase produces a 3% GDP reduction over the long term? European countries tend to have total tax rates that are upwards of 15% higher than ours, which should mean their GDPs are 45% lower. For the most part, however, GDP per hour worked in Europe is only modestly lower than ours.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm slipped in that &#8220;per hour worked&#8221; didn&#8217;t he.  Obviously the Romers are looking for effects via aggregate demand not productivity.  However, a broader analysis would make the point much more strongly.  The tax burden is a higher share of GNP in rich countries than in poor countries and is not significantly correlated with slower growth (I&#8217;m always going back to <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=227328">Easterly and Rebello 1993</a> which is getting a bit long in the tooth).</p>
<p>However, that&#8217;s not what the Romers are talking about at all.  Basically 3 years is not long run.</p>
<p>I am an economist and immediately perceive the paper to be a vindication of Keynes not of Laffer.  I think your key question is the Europe question.  The effect appears to be at a Laffable level.  However, what they are really discussing is the medium term effect of budget deficits.  </p>
<p>Europe has high taxes, but doesn&#8217;t have high budget deficits.  </p>
<p>Now the Romer&#8217;s would not propose huge tax cuts.  That is because, they assume that the long run effect of budget deficits on GNP is zero (increased demand just ends up as increased inflation) or negative (if deficits crowd out investment).</p>
<p>Roughly 3 years is not at all the long run.  </p>
<p>In fact, the long run effects of deficits on growth appear to be negative (and large).  This is based on comparing growth in different countries.</p>
<p>Now as to the methodology, the Romers are highly respected, but no one really trusts anyone to make subjective decisions in a way that doesn&#8217;t lead to bias.  I think that this paper, like a similar paper on monetary policy, is likely to convince no one.</p>

<p>WHY BILL GATES GETS SOCIAL SECURITY</p>
<p>for Aaron</p>
<p>In a recent thread reader Aaron asserts in his confident way that &#8220;if Trump, Soros, and Redstone get Social Security &#8220;then in can&#8217;t be an insurance policy for poverty in old age.  These three are not poor yet they qualify for social security.&#8221;</p>
<p>To see where Aaron has gone wrong, we need to return through time to the golden days of yore when Bill Gates was still a very young man.</p>
<p>Young Bill was not yet rich, but he was sure he would be.  Still, being a nerdy kind of guy, Bill liked to think things through.  Certainly it was very likely he would be rich, but not absolutely certain.  He could have an accident, or get sick, or Apple could drive him out of business.  So, yes, unlikely, but he COULD end up poor.  And Bill was not the kind of guy who would enjoy living under bridges and eating out of the dumpster behind the Safeway, so he needed a fallback plan&#8230; just in case.</p>
<p>He could do like Coberly&#8217;s gramma said: put 10% of everything he made in the bank so he&#8217;d have something to retire on.  But he&#8217;d have to hope that 10% wouldn&#8217;t be eaten up by inflation&#8230;  so, maybe,  but still not as sure a thing as he&#8217;d like.   He looked at the stock market and thought, yeah, I could probably stay ahead of inflation there,  but if my luck went bad, the Stock Market turned down the day I decided to retire, or if i got sick or had that accident early in life, I wouldn&#8217;t have enough to put into the stock market.  It&#8217;s hard to find a lot of investment money when you are making just barely enough to buy groceries and shoes for the kids..</p>
<p>So, Insurance!,  I&#8217;ll buy an insurance policy.   He goes to Providential Insurance company and asks, &#8220;how much will the premiums be to guarantee me an income of a thousand a month after I turn 65?&#8221;  The Providential man tells him.  But Bill is a smart guy, remember, so he asks&#8230; &#8220;is that thousand going to be adjusted for inflation?&#8221;  Well, no, says the agent. &#8220;How much to buy a policy adjusted for inflation?&#8221;  The man either says he can&#8217;t insure for inflation, because he as no idea how much inflation could be in the next forty years, or he quotes a figure like 2000 a month.  Bill says, &#8220;so I give you two thousand a month for forty years and you guarantee me a thousand a month for a life expectancy of less than 20 years after age 65?&#8221;  Something like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, by the way, how do I know Providential will still be in business in 40 years?&#8221;  Oh, ahem, we&#8217;re a very solid company.  Nothing ever goes wrong like that.</p>
<p>Bill is not convinced, and he is not happy. He has another idea:</p>
<p>&#8220;How much if you pay off only if I am poor when I reach 65?&#8221;  No can do, says the man.  &#8220;Why not?&#8221;  Because we would have no way to check to be sure whether you were really poor or just hiding your assets.  Anyway, the probability of you being poor&#8230; not you, of course, but the general population&#8230; is much higher than you would suppose.  More than 50%, so you wouldn&#8217;t really save that much.</p>
<p>So Bill says, I&#8217;ll think about it.</p>
<p>On the way home, he meets a Tall Man in a striped suit with a tall hat, and, oddly, a cigarette holder cocked jauntily in his teeth.  The Tall Man says, I hear you are looking for an Old Age Insurance policy.  Have I got a deal for you.</p>
<p>The Tall Man say, I can guarantee you against inflation using something I call pay as you go financing with wage indexing. But it only works if everybody in the country joins the insurance pool.  And no, I can&#8217;t insure for just the possibility that you are poor.  By the time we set up a government proctology bureaucracy that would cost as much as just paying you the money when you reach 65 whether or not you are poor.  We would need to collect about 12% of your first hundred thousand a year, and we would pay about 40% of your average monthly pay, up to that hundred thousand, each month when you retire.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean &#8220;about&#8221;?&#8221;  asks Bill.  Well, says the Tall Man.  In order to make this work for everyone, we do need to adjust the returns so that the very poorest people get enough to live on, a little more than 40%.  And the only place to get the money would be to reduce the return on the richest to about 30%.  &#8220;So I only get 30%?&#8221; asks Bill.  Only if you retire rich, says the Tall Man, if your luck goes bad, you could get 50% or more.  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s insurance.<br />________________________________<br />by reader coberly</p>

<p>As we watch the &#8220;team&#8221; Obama is putting together and the <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/11/23/obama/index.html">discussions regarding</a> how reflective of progressive ideas they are vs same old, same old, I thought I would add to the hunt for Obama&#8217;s true identity.   These are comments from his policy positions regarding development of our living environment and the economic relationship.  I was keyed to these via a notice I receive from the Smart Growth movement.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/elizah/gG5gCS">Build More Livable and Sustainable Communities</a></strong>: Over the longer term, we know that the amount of fuel we will use is directly related to our land use decisions and development patterns, much of which have been organized around the principle of cheap gasoline. Barack Obama believes that we must move beyond our simple fixation of investing so many of our transportation dollars in serving drivers and that we must make more investments that make it easier for us to walk, bicycle and access transportation alternatives.<br />Level Employer Incentives for Driving and Public Transit: The federal tax code rewards driving to work by allowing employers to provide parking benefits of $205 per month tax free to their employees. The tax code provides employers with commuting benefits for transit, carpooling or vanpooling capped at $105 per month. This gives drivers a nearly 2:1 advantage over transit users.  Obama will reform the tax code to make benefits for driving and public transit or ridesharing equal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfwpQx5La9c">The top 100 metro areas </a>generate two-thirds of our jobs, nearly 80% of patents, and handle 75% of all seaport tonnage. In fact, 42 of our metro areas now rank among the world&#8217;s 100 largest economies. &#8220;To seize the possibility of this moment, we need to promote strong cities as the backbone of regional growth. And yet, Washington remains trapped in an earlier era, wedded to an outdated &#8216;urban&#8217; agenda that focuses exclusively on the problems in our cities, and ignores our growing metro areas. Strong cities are the building blocks of strong regions, and strong regions are essential for a strong America&#8230;.that is the new metropolitan reality and we need a new strategy that reflects it . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Obama furthers his argument that type of transportation is important in the overall picture of our living arrangements which relates to the overall quality of our economy.<br />Responding to <a href="http://t4america.org/blog/archives/534">Transportation for America&#8217;s petition</a>:<br />
<blockquote>We need our next president to lead an initiative to invest in public transit, high-speed trains, places to bike and walk, and green innovation. We need a president with a plan that can put millions to work in jobs that can’t be outsourced, bring down the costs of travel, and create a sustainable infrastructure that will keep America on the cutting edge.</p></blockquote>
<p>Obama answers:<br />
<blockquote>And I think you’ve identified an important part of the answer as well. Our economy is slowing down, we need to stimulate it. Jobs are disappearing; we need to create new ones. At the same time, our infrastructure is crumbling and we need to rebuild it.<br />I had already proposed creating a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank, funded with $60 billion over 10 years, to expand and enhance, not replace, existing federal transportation investments.<br />I will invest $150 billion over the next decade in renewable sources of energy to create five million new, green jobs – jobs that pay well and can’t be outsourced; jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel- efficient cars;&#8230;<br />I support Amtrak funding and the development of high-speed freight and passenger rail networks across the country.<br />As you know, all of these measures will have significant environmental and metropolitan planning advantages and help diversify our nation’s transportation infrastructure. Everyone benefits if we canleave our cars, walk, bicycle and access other transportation alternatives. I agree that we can stop wasteful spending and save Americans money, and as president, I will re- evaluate the transportation funding process to ensure that smart growth considerations are taken into account.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, he talked the lingo of progressive minded people.  Do these statements suggest that the ideology behind his pragmatism is progressive?  </p>
<p>If the change we wanted was not to be bull shitted anymore, and the one I&#8217;m listening to is talking &#8220;change&#8221; using lingo, presenting policy plans of what I want, was I wrong to think they were talking no more bull shit?  <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/larison/2008/11/24/paying-a-price/">Are those</a> <a href="http://campaignsilo.firedoglake.com/2008/11/22/obama-and-a-paucity-of-progressives/"> talking</a> <a href="http://openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=10094">like</a> Glen Greenwald correct in that people should not be surprised with Obama&#8217;s appointments?  Maybe, but then based on the above Obama words, that would mean we (you and I) just plain have to approach our relationship with governing as suspect until proven otherwise.  Unfortunately, that means we will always be a day late and a dollar short having never known at the time of the decision if we made the correct one because you can not go by what is said. </p>
<p>Hey, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/austan-goolsbee-obamas-econ-man.html">I posted about Goolsbee</a> and even asked if bringing in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/senator-obama-chooses-jason-furman-econ.html">Jason Furman</a> was a concession to the Clinton/blue dogs, did it mean the DLC kept control of the money issues.  Does this mean that the non blog savy voter can not rely on what Obama said?  Do you understand what the answer of &#8220;yes&#8221; means?  Are those informing us that we should have known better, also saying that knowing the talk of &#8220;change&#8221; by Mc Cain et al was bull shit were not real in our understanding of what Obama was saying?  </p>
<p>Come-on already!  This is like blamming people for the down economy because of their consuming in an economy that is 75% consumption.  We&#8217;re progressives, for christ sake&#8230; We Trust.   </p>
<p>Do you know what happens to a person when they can never get a straight, no hidden agenda answer from one they count on?  They go nuts.</p>

<p>reads </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/business/23citi.html?hp=&#038;pagewanted=all">Eric Dash and Julie Creswell</a> who argue that Citibank took insane risks holding CDOs on its books, because of a failure of the fixed incomes risk management team, reckless &#8216;short termism&#8217; and two amazing mistakes.  The two alleged mistakes are that they trusted the ratings agencies and that they assumed that the national average house price would certainly not decline.  These are actually similar mistakes as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/11/liars-bond-ratings.html">at least one rating agency, S&#038;P, making the same insane assumption about house prices.</a></p>
<p>They write:</p>
<blockquote><p>when examiners from the Securities and Exchange Commission began scrutinizing Citigroup’s subprime mortgage holdings after Bear Stearns’s problems surfaced, the bank told them that the probability of those mortgages defaulting was so tiny that they excluded them from their risk analysis, according to a person briefed on the discussion who would speak only without being named.</p>
<p>Later that summer, when the credit markets began seizing up and values of various C.D.O.’s began to plummet, Mr. Maheras, Mr. Barker and Mr. Bushnell participated in a meeting to review Citigroup’s exposure.</p>
<p>The slice of mortgage-related securities held by Citigroup was “viewed by the rating agencies to have an extremely low probability of default (less than .01%),” according to Citigroup slides used at the meeting and reviewed by The New York Times. </p></blockquote>
<p>and </p>
<blockquote><p>C.D.O.’s were complex, and even experienced managers like Mr. Maheras and Mr. Barker underestimated the risks they posed, according to people with direct knowledge of Citigroup’s business. Because of that, they put blind faith in the passing grades that major credit-rating agencies bestowed on the debt.</p></blockquote>
<p>and finally </p>
<blockquote><p>To make matters worse, Citigroup’s risk models never accounted for the possibility of a national housing downturn, this person [who worked in the CDO group] said,</p></blockquote>
<p>This is amazing.  It&#8217;s not as if no one with an Op-Ed column in the New York Times was discussing the possibility of a national housing downturn.  I can&#8217;t believe that this was an honest oversight.  The anonymous source doesn&#8217;t say either &#8220;“I just think senior managers got addicted to the revenues and arrogant about the risks they were running. As long as you could grow revenues, you could keep your bonus growing.”</p>
<p>Wow.  </p>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/11/le-citi-toujour.html">Brad Delong argues</a> that 43 billion is a small part of Citibanks problems.  He is talking about market capitalization not book equity which matters given capital requirements.  I mean also not a tiny part, and 43 billion here 43 billion there and soon your talking real money.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/11/23/extra-credit-saturday-edition?tid=true">Felix</a>, we discover Joe Nocera at the NYT reporting that <a href="http://executivesuite.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/what-securitization-problem-the-fdic-weighs-in/">securitization professionals are not as stupid as they would have had us believe</a>:<br />
<blockquote>What [the FDIC] has discovered, said [Michael H. Krimminger, the F.D.I.C.’s special adviser to the chairman for policy], is that the contracts are rarely as constricting as investors and servicers have been portraying them. They do not allow principal reduction, for sure, but they almost never disallow interest rate reduction — or delaying principal payments for a short time. What’s more, Mr. Krimminger said, the servicer agreement simply says that the servicer’s job is to maximize the investment — which often means avoiding foreclosure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Buyers of a security want the best return they can get.  Foreclosure stops that cash flow, and bankruptcy procedures—at their best—impede those flows.</p>
<p>This is the rational position.  So what had Nocera written that caused Bair and Krimminger to call him?:<br />
<blockquote>I have quoted a number of experts and people in the securitization business who have told me repeatedly that it is nearly impossible to modify mortgages that are trapped in toxic mortgage-backed securities. The contracts, they say, don’t really have provisions for preventing foreclosures. And the servicers face terrible conflicts if they try to modify mortgages, because inevitable some of the bond investors will do better than others — depending on where they stand along the risk continuum — and under those same contracts, servicers are obliged to treat all investors alike. Finally, I’ve heard, servicers have been unwilling to lift a finger for homeowners because they have no financial incentive to do so — and they face the prospect of being sued by one of their investors if they do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Servicers have been unwilling to lift a finger, and as such are not following the fiduciary responsibility of ensuring investors an appropriate return.</p>
<p>And it takes the bloody Chair of the FDIC—not the Treasury Secretary, whose former firm made piles of money for him with such securitization procedures—to understand the situation and tell the truth.</p>
<p>Apparently, we have to wait for some large investor and/or hedge funds whose bonds have gone into the default to sue their servicer before someone outside of the FDIC understands that investors prefer receiving some money to none.</p>
<p>Update:  I see, via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/11/why-sheila-bair.html">Mark Thoma</a>, that John Hempton is being stupid.  Is this a unique situation, or is he selling something?  It <a href="http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2008/11/tax-benefits-wells-and-wachovia.html">appears to be the latter</a>.</p>

This article reminds us that even though the Doha rounds are done, the WTO structure is in place.</p>
<blockquote><p>A U.S.-triggered spate of global carmaker-bailout proposals may spark trade disputes over whether the Americans are unfairly trying to subsidize their industry or just making up for state aid that foreign rivals already enjoy.</p>
<p>As the U.S. considers a lifeline for its auto companies, officials in Europe, Canada and Asia are considering their own aid packages &#8212; even as the European Union threatens to lodge a complaint against any U.S. bailout to protect manufacturers from Renault SA in France to Fiat SpA in Italy.</p>
<p>China also may complain, though the government is considering helping SAIC Motor Corp. and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co.</p>
<p>Any World Trade Organization complaints may open a Pandora’s Box, bringing to a head a long-simmering dispute over policies that U.S.-based General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC say unfairly aid rivals, including state-financed health-care and retirement benefits, and currency policies.</p>
<p>“Frankly, it’s stones and glass houses,” said Garel Rhys, professor of automotive economics at Cardiff Business School in Wales. “Everybody has been at this game for their own interests; nobody is pure.”</p>
<p>Neelie Kroes, the European Union’s antitrust chief, weighed in on the debate yesterday, urging the bloc’s 27 nations to avoid the “costly trap of a subsidy race” that would give some countries unfair advantages.</p>
<p>Greater ‘Temptation’</p>
<p>“The temptation may be greater now for member states to give subsidies that can result in their economic problems being exported to their neighbors but that would only worsen the economic difficulties,” Kroes said at a conference in Brussels.</p>
<p>“The European economy and European taxpayers will be better off if politicians choose another, more effective, route,” Kroes added. She pointed to EU rules allowing limited aid that doesn’t distort competition, including grants for entrepreneurs, research, education and environmental projects.</p>
<p>The U.S. kicked off the bailout war. Congress is trying to reach a compromise on giving automakers $25 billion the companies say they need to survive the next year, either by speeding up the use of funds already approved to develop more fuel-saving technologies and models or by providing a new source of funds. President-elect Barack Obama, who complained during the campaign that South Korea created disadvantages for American carmakers, supports helping the industry.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2008/11/22/braindead_microphone/index.html?source=newsletter">David Sirota at Salon</a> has reflected my take on media and says it much better than I.  And <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/blog-entry/2008114721/study-shows-center-right-nation-narrative-spiked-immediately-after-election-da">here</a> in addition to the first link.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’re having trouble remembering what the recent election was all about, rest easy: You’re probably not going senile — you’re likely experiencing the momentary effects of brainwashing.</p>
<p>For weeks, your television, newspaper and radio have been telling you that America is a &#8220;center-right nation&#8221; that elected Barack Obama to crush his fellow &#8220;socialist&#8221; hippies, discard the agenda he campaigned on, and meet the policy demands of electorally humiliated Republicans.</p>
<p>This is the usual post-election nonsense from the Braindead Megaphone, as author George Saunders famously calls our political and media noise machine. When George W. Bush wins by 3 million votes, the megaphone blares announcements about a conservative mandate that Democrats must respect. When Obama wins by twice as much, the same megaphone roars about Democrats having no mandate to do anything other than appease conservatives.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s confusing, isn&#8217;t it? We hazily recall backing Obama and his progressive platform. Yet, the megaphone&#8217;s re-educative shock treatment aims to wipe away that memory and conjure eternal conservatism from our spotless minds.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have polling to maintain our sanity.</p>
<p>Public opinion surveys show that most Obama voters knew the Illinois senator was a progressive when they cast their ballots — and that those votes for him weren&#8217;t just anti-Bush protests; they were ideological. According to a post-election poll by my colleagues at the Campaign for America&#8217;s Future, 70 percent of Americans say they want conservatives to help this progressive president enact his decidedly progressive agenda.</p></blockquote>
<p>But we have a possible 1 trillion dollar federal budget deficit:</p>
<p>*<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;A trillion-dollar deficit is not only something you wouldn&#8217;t have seen in an economic textbook, it is something that even a science fiction writer would not dare mention,&#8221; said Stan Collender, one of the nation&#8217;s most respected budget analysts, who was a budget staffer for both the House and Senate and now works for a Washington corporate communications company.</p></blockquote>
<p>A serious problem with Medicare expenditures and a growing burden of using increasing % of income for health care, shrinking state and local government revenue for services, a trade imbalance that makes recovery seriously difficult for most Americans, and some economically oriented ideologies that can only claim purity and offers &#8216;if only&#8217;, &#8216;other factors all being equal&#8217; (slipping past the need for an answer), and platitudes about &#8216;the force&#8217; taking care of things come what may, externalities not being important.  </p>
<p>Spinners are pretty much bankrupt walking that talk&#8230;(then the flip side accusation is communism and 100% government.  That kind of argument has nothing to do with thinking, but simple personality structure&#8230;nuanced being not understood).  So the blathering is part of needing to publish something every day instead of saying &#8216;I don&#8217;t know&#8217;, &#8216;I need some time to think on it&#8217;, &#8216;Watch carefully to match intent and behavior&#8217;. &#8216;oops.&#8217;  Can voters handle nuance.  Not many I know.  Quite a quandary, yes?</p>

                                <p>Late Working-Age Suicides Rising:  Study</p>
<p>Noni Mausa</p>
<p>This study from the American Journal Of Preventive Medicine offers troubling statistics – between 1999 and 2005, there has been roughly a 5% increase in suicide rates.  But all that increase is confined to one demographic &#8212; whites aged 40 to 64.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-suicide21-2008oct21,0,838216.story">L. A. Times story</a> today reports:<br />
<blockquote>A new six-year analysis in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that the U.S. suicide rate rose to 11 per 100,000 people in 2005, from 10.5 per 100,000 in 1999, an increase of just under 5%.</p>
<p>The report found that virtually all of the increase was attributable to a nearly 16% jump in suicides among people ages 40 to 64, a group not commonly seen as high-risk. The rate for that age group rose to 15.6 per 100,000 in 2005, from 13.5 per 100,000 in 1999.</p>
<p>Susan P. Baker, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health and an author of the study, said she was baffled by the findings. Sociological studies have found that middle age is generally a time of relative security and emotional well-being, she said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Guoqing Hu, PhDab, Holly C. Wilcox, PhDd, Lawrence Wissow, MD, MPHc, Susan P. Baker, MPHbCorresponding Author Informationemail address</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The overall suicide rate in the U.S. increased by 6% between 1981 and 1986 and declined by 18% between 1986 and 1999. Detailed descriptions of recent trends in suicide are lacking, especially with regard to the method of suicide. Information is needed on the major changes in rates of suicide in specific population groups in recent years (1999–2005).</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Mortality data came from the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System. Suicide trends during 1981–2005 were analyzed by age, race, gender, and method, with an emphasis on increases between 1999 and 2005. Linear regression was used to examine the significance of trends in suicide mortality. The annual percentage change in rates was employed to measure the linear trend in suicide mortality.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>The suicide rate increased after 1999, due primarily to an increase in suicide among whites aged 40–64 years, whose rate of completed suicide between 1999 and 2005 rose by 2.7% annually for men and by 3.9% annually for women, with increases of 6.3% and 2.3% for hanging/suffocation, 2.8% and 19.3% for poisoning, and 1.5% and 1.9% for firearms for men and women, respectively. Rates did not increase for other age or racial groups.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>The differential increases by age, race, gender, and method underscore a change in the epidemiology of suicide. Whites aged 40–64 years have recently emerged as a new high-risk group for suicide. Although firearms remain the most common method of suicide, the notable increases in suicide by hanging/suffocation in men and by poisoning in women deserve preventive attention.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what to make of this, though it would be easy to say that the members of the previously secure age group have since 1999 been hitting the wall like warblers in migration time.  The numbers in this study only take us up to 2005 &#8212; I wonder what;s been happening since then?</p>

<p>Matthey Yglesias <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/11/interesting_reading.php#comment-859726">points</a> to <a href="http://mediamatters.org/progmaj/report">an old mediamatters.com report</a> which attempts to demolish the center right nation claim.  I think the report is a precious resource as it collects the relevant data.  Previously I found myself wasting a lot of time searching pollingreport.com.</p>
<p>I have some thoughts on the report after the jump.</p>
<p>update: also my effort to find the relevant definition of the center.</p>
<p>    Ah, I thought, a challenge—can I interpret “center right nation” so that it makes sense to warn Democrats that the USA is a center right nation ? I must find a definition of a center which isn’t well to the left of any point to which the Democrats might overstretch.<br />    OK how about the point X where the fraction of Republican representatives to the left of X is equal to the fraction of Democratic representatives to the right of X ? Not ideal. By that definition the center moved right in 2006 and 2008 as moderate Democrats beat moderate Republicans in swing districts, but it will do well enough to make the claim “America is a center right nation” even wrong.</p>
<p>    The claim then becomes that more US citizens self identify as Democrats than as Republicans, their views on policy are to the right of X. I am quite sure that this is not true—on tax progressivity, the minimum wage, universal health insurance, environmental protection, the war in Iraq, should government do more, and does the government have a responsibility to take care of people most citizens are to the left of X. On the death penalty (if you assume that Democrats who claim to support it are lying) and AFDC (if you remember what it was and who was President when it became TANF), due process rights and overwhelmingly creationism vs natural selection most US citizens are to the right of X. In other words, if the Democrats abandone decades old policy positions, they might end up too far left for the median voter.</p>
<p>    By my definition the USA was a center left country from at the latest 1996 through the present except maybe for a year or two after 9/11. However, I thought, with great effort and in a spirit of bipartisanship, I can interpret Republicans claims so they are meaningful albeit false.</p>
<p>    Then I read this<br />    http://thinkprogress.org/2008/11/20/boehner-center-right/</p>
<p>    BOEHNER: … I think the Congress is still a center-right Congress.</p>
<p>    OK back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>Now my report on the report</p>
<p>The report is excellent and shows that the authors put a huge amount of work in it.  In contrast this comment is off the top of my head.  I will try to get the relatively interesting stuff up here at the top.  </p>
<p>When asserting the bogosity of the center right nation claim, I have repeatedly found myself wasting time scrolling past irrelevant data at pollingreport.com looking for the relevant poll which shows that adult Americans have progressive views on the key issue under dispute.  The report, which I just hotlisted, is a precious resource getting the relevant data in one place and not mixing it with ten times as many polls on whether you approve of how George Bush is handling an issue.</p>
<p>However the mass of data presented is considerable less than the mass of relevant data.  In particular, media matters has cherry picked.  On abortion, for example, there is a huge amount of polling data.  Polls on &#8220;If a woman should be allowed to have an abortion if chooses to have one for the following reason (list of reasons) show only a minority saying yes for all reasons.  This shows that there are people who must have contradictory views &#8212; who support Roe vs Wade in the abstract but disagree with it when the questions get specific http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm.  </p>
<p>I think what is needed is for conservatives with integrity (not as rare as flying pigs) to attempt a counter-report following the outline of the media matters report, but picking different polls with slightly different wording for each issue heading.  Then, comparing the reports, interested readers could decide who had made a more convincing case.  I don&#8217;t doubt that I personally would conclude that media matters is right and if the center is half way between Dems and Reps the US is a center left to left nation.  But, you know, debate is really useful.  Pity there are so few reality based conservatives with whom mediamatters et al can debate.</p>
<p>[there should be another &#8220;There&#8217;s more&#8221; jump here but I don&#8217;t know how to nest them.</p>
<p>As a regular reader of pollingreport.com and also of liberal blogs, I can&#8217;t say I was generally surprised by the data reported by mediamatters.  I was surprised by the results on crime and punishment.  </p>
<p>Nor am I generally surprised by pundits making claims about what Americans think which are inconsistent with polling data, although I thought everyone knew that a majority supports gun control (which majority loses to the minority which includes many people who care passionately and are organized by the NRA as well as reality based critics claims for the effectiveness of gun control such as you and &#8230; birds chirp &#8230; well you must know some others).</p>
<p>I did object to the text above the data on protectionism.  I was going to comment dilating on the theme &#8220;What&#8217;s progressive about nationalist xenophobic hostility to the interests of workers in poor countries&#8221; until I got to the paragraph after the data which noted that opposition to free trade is not necessarily based on progressive motives.  I am still pissed that one of those ideology self tests said I was socially liberal but not egalitarian, because my views on trade are based on concern for the interests of the poorest people in the world who sure aren&#8217;t US workers.</p>

<p>PGL raises and answers this question over at Econospeak <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/11/healthcare-debate-so-this-is-why.html">Health Care Debate: So This is Why Conservatives Hate Social Security</a>. Or rather he allows Conservatives in the person of Michael Cannon at Cato admit the fundamental truth: successful government social programs fatally undercut future political success for the Right. Cannon: <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2008/11/13/blocking-obamas-health-plan-is-key-to-the-gops-survival">Blocking Obama&#8217;s Health Plan is Key to the GOP&#8217;s Survival</a></p>
<p>PGL sums it up as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Truth be told – this is a major reason why conservatives want to undermine the Social Security program. Yes – they do try to tell us it’s some sort of Ponzi scheme, which of course, is just blatant dishonesty. But the real reason that they hate Social Security is that it is popular – as well as good policy from the perspective of those who care at least as much about the working class as the investor class.</p></blockquote>
<p> Another way of saying this is that the debate over Social Security is not and never really has been about the best way to insure retirement security for workers, opponents simply don&#8217;t care that their numbers don&#8217;t add up, when indeed they use numbers at all. Instead they approach the subject from two conjoined perspectives: one that Social Security (and Universal Health Care coverage) is Socialism and/or two that Social Security (and Universal Health Care) if perceived to be successful are political winners for the Democrats for possibly decades to come.</p>
<p>In practice it is hard to separate out the Hayekians who believe that all of this is just the first steps on the <a href="http://www.mises.org/books/TRTS/">Road to Serfdom</a> from the Rovians who believe that successful social programs are instead the Road to Political Oblivian for the Republican Party from the Sheep who simply know what they have been told. And of course these groups all to a degree cross-cut, it is difficult to reliably differentiate knave from fool. But no one who cares about Social Security or Universal Health Care coverage should assume that the opposition they encounter are solely motivated by data about program effectiveness and relative costs, that you are going to get through to these people by explaining how small the problem is in the case of Social Security or how honest cross-country cost/outcome numbers show that other developing countries get more bang for their health care buck, that is to make the simple mistake that political discourse on these topics is fundamentally Reality Based instead of being what it really is: driven by ideology on one hand and political outcomes on the other.</p>
<p>For many, many people the claim &#8220;There is no Crisis&#8221; is not the answer to a specific problem, instead it IS the problem. Without &#8216;Crisis&#8217; they got nothing. And the smarter, better informed ones know it (hence the whiff of panic floating around the halls of Cato).</p>
