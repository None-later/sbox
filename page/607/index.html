                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/07/07/1184635.aspx">FirstRead</a> does a nice job of first laying out what the McCain camp tried to claim and then getting to the facts.  Let’s start with some bogus claim from someone who has never had an ounce of credibility on fiscal matters:</p>
<blockquote><p>This gets to Obama’s “credibility,” Forbes said on a conference call with reporters, and cited it as an example of the Illinois senator “saying one thing and doing another.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Next the Democratic response to this garbage:</p>
<blockquote><p>The DNC issued this response, in part: &#8220;On a conference call with reporters today, Steve Forbes and Doug Holtz-Eakin showed how far the McCain is willing to go to deflect attention away from McCain’s promise of a third Bush term on the economy. First, Forbes falsely claimed that John McCain has never voted for a tax increase—a claim that prompted a rebuke from the Club for Growth during the primaries. In fact, McCain has support tax increases on everything from vaccines to phone cards.  &#8220;Then, Doug Holtz-Eakin tried to explain how John McCain plans to make the Bush tax cuts he once opposed permanent and still balance the budget by 2013.  His recipe: cutting discretionary spending and promoting growth.  Not only does McCain’s math not even come close to adding up, but Holtz-Eakin himself said it would be impossible to cut enough spending to balance the budget.  Plus, before he reversed himself to pander to the right wing of his party, McCain used to reject the idea that we can grow our way out of budget-busting tax cuts.  The new McCain, however, is promising four more years of George Bush’s borrow and spend budgeting.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Next – some fact checking by Ken Strickland of NBC:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was no vote during the budget resolution process to actually raise taxes.  Simply put, there was not a vote which in effect said, &#8220;let&#8217;s raise taxes by 3% on certain tax brackets.&#8221; So Obama did not vote to raise taxes per se. BUT&#8230; The overall budget resolution does assume the BUSH 2001/2003 tax cuts will expire (or have to be offset by new spending.) And if they expire, taxes in the 25, 28, and 33 percent tax brackets would increase 3% as Holtz-Eakin suggests. (Democrats are happy to remind folks that McCain was against those tax cuts, before he was for them.)  &#8211; Also noteworthy: The budget resolution is NOT/NOT a law, NOT binding. (The President of the United States doesn&#8217;t even sign it.) Instead, it&#8217;s a blueprint of sorts that gives guidance to how congressional tax writers write tax laws in the Finance Committee. That panel is not bound to what the budget says, and often votes to &#8220;waive&#8221; budget rules.  Bottom line: While it may be a bit of a stretch to say Obama voted to raise taxes, it is accurate to suggest that Obama&#8217;s support for the budget resolution indicates a willingness to let the tax cuts expire&#8211;thus potentially causing a tax increase.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, let’s turn the microphone over to <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/07/douglas-holtz-e.html">Brad DeLong</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Douglas Holtz-Eakin gained a lot of credibility working to stop the budget insanity first inside the Bush White House and then as Director of the Congressional Budget Office. He is now burning that credibility very rapidly &#8230; This is, I think, a bad mistake for Doug Holtz-Eakin. If McCain wins in November, Holtz-Eakin will need credibility with Democratic as well as Republican senators. And if McCain doesn&#8217;t win in November, Holtz-Eakin will need credibility with Democratic as well as Republican economists.</p></blockquote>

<p>As I thought about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/nominal-v-real-did-luskin-learn.html">this post</a> on real wages, it struck me that I have not been providing my usual graphs of BLS data when discussing the labor market.  So my first graph shows a real wage series from January 2002 to May 2008 indicating that the real wages of nonsupervisory workers was the same during May 2008 as it was during January 2002 – something that Donald Luskin seems to not know even if Paul Krugman and Brad DeLong do.  I would hope by now that most of our readers also know how to check BLS data.  </p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/but-unemployment-did-not-increase.html">Last Thursday</a>, I noted that the employment-population (EP) ratio:</p>
<blockquote><p>was 63.0% as of June 2007, was 62.6% as of May 2008, and now stands at 62.4%. So why didn’t the unemployment rate rise? It seems the labor force participation rate fell from 66.2% as of May 2008 to 66.1% as of June 2008. Then again – it was 66.1% as of June 2007. The unemployment rate last June 2007 was only 4.6%. With the labor force participation rate over the past year being unchanged, the rise in the unemployment rates just happens to track the drop in the employment-population rate quite well. And the news is really bad indeed. In fact, when we compare the employment-population ratio as of December 2006, which was 63.4%, to the 62.4% as of last month &#8211; things look dreadful.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our second graph takes the EP ratio and the labor force participation rate (LFP) back to January 2001.  Notice that the EP ratio is currently a lot lower than it was back in January 2001 and that LFP is also lower.  One could (or was that should) complain that our current 5.5 percent unemployment rate is higher than it was when George W. Bush took office but even that masks the dramatic decline in the percent of adults who are employed.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://blogs.ft.com/undercover/2008/07/field-centipedes-and-the-perils-of-rationality/">Tim Harford</a> (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/07/links-for-200-6.html">Mark Thoma</a>) presents the old trade-off between Rationality and Cooperation, with a curious parenthetic:<br />
<blockquote>Except, nobody really thinks this is the way players would behave in reality. The optimal strategy seems sociopathic; isn’t it worth playing cooperatively in the hope that the other player will do the same thing? (Unlike much real human interaction, standard game theory does not accomodate the “hope” that someone else will play suboptimally: optimal play is to be expected at all times. )</p>
<p>But Ignacio Palacios-Huerta&#8230;and Oscar Volij gave the centipede game to skilled chess players. They found that the chess players were far more likely to play optimally; grandmasters always played optimally and took the $4. Hyper-rationality can be a disadvantage. (Or did the experiment discover something else: that chess grandmasters are sociopaths?) Palacios-Huerta and Volij don’t speculate. My guess is that they have discovered something about the rationality rather than morality or empathy of chess players, but I may be wrong. [emphasis mine; parenthetic link about real football omitted]</p></blockquote>
<p>They should run the same experiment with <a href="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2007/09/freakiology-yes-folks-its-part-4-of.html">Tour de France riders</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The U.S. had 28 million immigrants _ legal and illegal _ age 16 and older in 2000, an increase of 61 percent from 1990. By 2004, there were 32 million.</p>
<p>Immigrants tend to be younger and have less education than American workers. The study, however, found &#8220;no apparent relationship between the growth of foreign workers with less education and the employment outcome of native workers with the same low level of education.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The PEW study did not look at impact on wages. I wonder what predisposes us to first think of &#8216;too lazy&#8217; versus &#8216;low wages&#8217; or such as first thought? And given the lack of popular research, why policy seems uninformed? <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/immigration-debate-labor-shortages-and.html">Lazy millionaires</a> ?</p>
<p>A lot of examples of how immigrants gain work is taken from day labor or migrant labor. Then there is a claim that educated Americans do not take jobs as in high tech areas by another set of businesses.   How can this be framed in some more accurate way?</p>

                                <p>If anyone has had to endure Lawrence Kudlow’s cheerleading as to how wages have continued to grow, I would at least hope that you recognized that this National Review nitwit was talking about nominal wages and not real wages.  Well, it seems that his good buddy &#8211; <a href="http://www.poorandstupid.com/2008_06_01_chronArchive.asp#8731350295144373516">Donald Luskin</a> is similarly challenged about this incredibly basic economic concept:</p>
<blockquote><p>From the Krugman column yesterday: “In fact, wage growth actually seems to be slowing” Hasn’t he been telling us for 7 years that wages have been going down? How then is wage growth suddenly slowing?</p></blockquote>
<p>Time to turn the microphone over to <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/07/yes-it-is-donal.html">Brad DeLong</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The answer, of course, is simple: Measured real wages&#8211;that is, the number of dollars you have paid divided by the price level&#8211;have been at best flat or falling for almost this entire decade. That is because measured nominal wages&#8211;how many dollars you get paid&#8211;have been growing more slowly than prices. And just now the rate of nominal wage growth has been falling.  If you understand that real wages and nominal wages are two different things, you don&#8217;t get confused.  Does Luskin understand this? I think not. I remember a similar mistake from the past: Luskin&#8217;s attempt to compute the real exchange rate</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll let you check out the rest – but tell me something.  Why does anyone bother to listen to either village idiot (Kudlow or Luskin)?</p>

                                <p>UPDATE:  NYT Obituary <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/08/books/08disch.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin&#038;ref=obituaries&#038;pagewanted=print">here</a>.  Some book cover images added.
<p>Two years ago at <a href="http://www.readercon.org/">Readercon</a>, I found myself doing some hero-worship in the Green Room.</p>
<p>Friday, we had discovered that my piece on Jorge Luis Borges was the first of the appreciations of that year&#8217;s Memorial Guest of Honor.  (I assume this was because of its length.)  Saturday, Shira and I had interviewed living GoH <a href="http://www.jamesmorrow.net/">Jim Morrow</a>.  Sunday afternoon was going to be for seeing old friends.</p>
<p>Sunday morning, I came out of a panel, and there was Tom Disch, sitting alone in the Green Room.*</p>
<p>So I got five minutes—maybe ten—of getting to bubble over about &#8220;The Cardinal Detoxes&#8221; and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wings-Song-Thomas-M-Disch/dp/0312584660/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1215391714&#038;sr=1-4">On Wings of Song</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Alice-Thom-Demijohn/dp/0112575226/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1215391767&#038;sr=1-1">Black Alice</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Castle-Indolence-Poetry-Poets-Poetasters/dp/0312145594/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1215391677&#038;sr=8-1">The Castle of Indolence</a></em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SHQJi1BkBGI/AAAAAAAAAIg/myWt3Lc9ejk/s1600-h/OnWingsofSong0001.gif"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SHQJi1BkBGI/AAAAAAAAAIg/myWt3Lc9ejk/s400/OnWingsofSong0001.gif" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And he asked about why I was there, and I mumbled something, and Shira pointed out that I had written reviews for The Washington Post—to this man who had been the best reason to read <em>The Nation</em> for much of my early adult life.</p>
<p>And I asked about the rumors that he had stopped writing due to depression over his partner&#8217;s death (possibly not that directly), and he said he was still writing, and a few week&#8217;s later I found that he did indeed have some works scheduled to come out.  And I believed him.</p>
<p>But apparently, that <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/010413.html">stopped being true</a>.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m at all qualified to have the politics of an Angry Bear, <em>On Wings of Song</em> should get much of the credit. (The excesses are mine.)</p>

<p>*We had seen him on Friday night, having a pleasant dinner with Pamela Zoline, but that&#8217;s not a conversation one interrupts to hero-worship, even if you&#8217;re not trying to ride herd over two children in a dark bar.</p>

At that point we see Social Security geek Webb jumping in excitement (being one of the few people in history to get excited over Social Security financials). What is the source of this rather odd behavior? Well it came from an examination of the following number series.<br />1996&#8212;2029<br />1997&#8212;2029<br />1998&#8212;2032<br />1999&#8212;2034<br />2000&#8212;2037<br />Now when the Report was released in March 2000 it was certainly plausible that the next January would see the swearing in of President Gore. At that point no one had really heard of hanging chads or Diebold. Anyway it was reasonable to consider the long term implications of these dates.</p>
<p>The first column is Report Year, the second column projected Trust Fund Depletion, at that point in time the standard measure for &#8216;Crisis&#8217;. Now you can look at this series as being an improvement of eight years over a four year period (March 1996 to March 2000) which gives you an improvement rate of 2 years per year, or you can push the envelope and date the improvement over three years (March 1997 to March 2000) which gives you a rate of 2 2/3 per year, but it really doesn&#8217;t matter for our purposes. Because an event that retreats out on average at even one year per year is an event that never comes, if that rate is doubled that event rapidly recedes over the event horizon. Okay lets imagine President Gore approaching the end of his second term in 2008 having overseen a similar improvement at the 2 year per year rate in Depletion date. This would put depletion in the year 2053. A little calculation and we can see that Boomers would be ranging in age from 89 to 107, a point in time in which the mortality tables suggest more than half of our youngest cohort (the birth class of 64) will be dead. The suggestion that Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217;, at least as it was defined in 2000, as being caused by Boomer Retirement would be just as dead.</p>
<p>Okay remembering we are still in the year 2000, under a Democratic President committed to &#8216;Save Social Security First&#8217; and a Presidential Candidate committed to the same goal (though using the ultimately misleading metaphor of &#8216;Lock Box), what should have been the response to that number series? Well I&#8217;ll tell you, two questions should have been asked:</p>
<p>1) What caused the dates to change in the way they did? and<br />2) Can whatever caused the changes go on?</p>
<p>But I can tell you from experience that hardly anyone in a position of influence was asking that question, if fact if you separate out Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot that number starts approaching zero. Which is why Baker and Weisbrot called their 1999 book <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a>. If you follow me below the fold I am going to make a stab at answering the question of why these questions were not asked and then offer some answers to both.</p>
<p>Well the kindest answer is that after all those numbers were not in fact in the bag and that we should just defer to the professional judgement of the staff of the Office of the Chief Actuary as signed off by the Trustees of Social Security. After all in 2037 the Boomers would be ranging in age from 73 to 91 and would still be projected to having a major though declining impact on Social Security.</p>
<p>A more cynical answer is that Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; was in 2000 an advantage to both the Democratic Administration and its Republican opposition. For Clinton &#038; Gore &#8216;crisis&#8217; was largely defensive. Their argument was that tax cuts in the face of this impending crunch were reckless, and that far better would be to maintain budget restraint and pay down debt held by the public (which is what &#8216;Lock Box&#8217; actually boils down to operationally). On the other hand for the Republicans crisis was an advantage in three ways. One it was a nice poster child for their overall &#8216;Big Government is the Problem&#8217; narrative. Two its existence allowed them to push their then 64 year dream of killing Social Security in play. The third advantage was a little more subtle. Under their Supply Side theory the only real way to finance Social Security long term was to grow the economy through tax cuts, in their topsy-turvy world cutting taxes for the rich was simply a means to help out future elderly poor. Unfortunately their theory ran into trouble when it encountered our reality.</p>
<p>In the event asking those questions was not particularly convenient for either side at the time. Of course in the end the Republicans won the near term battle, they got to keep &#8216;crisis&#8217; in play and get their tax cuts anyway. Alright! Back in the Way Back Machine and lets take a trip forward to Nov. 2004. How has our number series held up? Well pretty good.<br />2000&#8212;2037<br />2001&#8212;2038<br />2002&#8212;2041<br />2003&#8212;2042<br />2004&#8212;2042<br />The rate of improvement certainly had slowed down, but still we had a total of five years of improvement over a four year period, moreover we got those pesky Boomers a little bit older and more out of the way. In 2042 they would be 78 to 96 and generally shuffling off the Buffalo and points beyond.</p>
<p>By 2004 those questions should have been being asked loudly and often:<br />1) What caused the dates to change in the way they did? and<br />2) Can whatever caused the changes go on?<br />Instead BushCo simply maintained the same stance they did back before 2000, they needed Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; in order to achieve their agenda, and their response was to cover their ears and shout &#8220;Wah, wah, wah. We can&#8217;t hear you!!&#8221;. Which didn&#8217;t save them during the &#8216;There is no Crisis&#8217; fight of 2005. But also didn&#8217;t make them give up their long term goals.</p>
<p>So what are the answers to the questions? Well lets dispose of the first typical answer, the dates of depletion did not change year over year because of changes in demographic assumptions. Those assumptions remained relatively stable over the period of Report years in question. There is no doubt that demography is hugely important in determining the long term outlook, but it has little impact on year to year reporting because generally speaking the fertility and mortality numbers were already baked into the cake.</p>
<p>Nope in examining the Reports year over year to see what changed from say 1999 to 2000 to cause a three year improvement in a single ear and the answer is clear: the economy did much, much better than projected. Moreover as Prof. Rosser and I have demonstrated in the past, the response in the Reporting was odd. In the face of continual underestimates of current year performance the reaction of the actuaries was to actually lower their projections going forward in what for the world looked like a pure effort to maintain &#8216;crisis&#8217;. This was particularly notable in the 2003 and 2004 Reports (see Tables V.B1 and V.B2). In particular rather inexplicable carving away at second year numbers went along with a milder slicing of current year numbers. The result as I showed in my Nov. 2004 post <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2004/11/what-is-low-cost-alternative-what-does.html">What is the Low Cost Alternative?</a>,  was Low Cost always returning the same operational result, Social Security funded but not over funded, a result which stayed constant through the 2007 Report year. (2008 shows Low Cost actually overfunding Social Security). So much for the first question: what changed? Economic growth numbers.</p>
<p>The answer to the second question is pretty easy, at least taken from when it was asked in 2000. Can this process continue? Absolutely because it did. The outlook for Social Security improved steadily from 2000 to 2003 because numbers on the whole came in better than expected. Now it is true that progress stalled in 2004 and actually went backwards in 2005 and 2006 only to improve again in 2007 and 2008 and we can if you like explore each of those Report years separately to see why that happened, but the general answer is that productivity stalled in such a way as to bring numbers more in line with Intermediate Cost than had been typical of the 1997 to 2003 period when outcomes closer or better than Low Cost. </p>
<p>(But all that goes to show you is that the idea that cutting taxes on the wealthy serves to boost investment and so productivity and so ultimately real wages for workers is not in fact supported by the actual numbers since the actual tax cut. But that would be to cut in on Spencer&#8217;s turf.)</p>
<p>Can productivity (or GDP or real wage or whatever interrelated measure you like) improve in ways that come in better than Intermediate Cost and so continue the longer range trend that would have Depletion (and so &#8216;crisis&#8217;) continue to move out in time. Well opinions vary. All I can say is that the people who were dismissive of Low Cost in the 1997 to 2003 period were all by the numbers proved to be wrong. When those same people insist that I just don&#8217;t get how ridiculous those assumptions are, I just have to ask &#8220;Well where were you when I was asking this question back in 2000?&#8221;</p>

                                <p>This year&#8217;s Olympics may well be a symbol or metaphor for rapid globalization. Sailing waters are choked with algae, a result of the chemical pollution; flotillas of boats are at work attempting to clear it so that sailors have at least a chance of moving off the starting line. As Bejiing grows, its water table continues to plummet. Attempts to supply the city with water may ultimately fail in the long term, according to <a href="http://redorbit.com/news/science/1454685/beijing_may_be_running_out_of_water/index.html">some</a>.</p>
<p>Chinese officials recently announced that tap water is now potable; the first city in China to receive that accolade. Some <a href="http://lioninoil.blogspot.com/2007/05/2008-beijing-olympics-bring-your-own.html">wags</a> are suggesting that you bring your own, just in case.</p>
<p>And then there is the air; we have all seen the pictures of people on the street with protective masks. <a href="http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=52585&#038;cat=6">Transworld News</a> has a cheery piece covering much of this as well as the questionable food.</p>
<p>Thus globalization proceeds apace under the watchful, environmentally conscious WTO.</p>
