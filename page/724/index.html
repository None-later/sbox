<p>1. Too big to fail, which may be true, but stay with the same management?</p>
<p>2. DolB can sell discounted flowers to all the readership using their on-line names and persona&#8217;s, and accept our thanks and promises, but next month no money? It is our fault? Morally, yes, but as a businessman he can yell at us all he wants, but it is his business. So then he can borrow from a guy from Dubai to make things right by letting him in on a percentage of his business. Duh&#8230;</p>
<p>3. OldVet&#8217;s post on Japan is another marker.</p>
<p>Anyway, is it time to say whatever the stated philosophy was, the real practice has made a mess of the world-wide econonomy?  No bailouts by the fed is replaced by soveriegn funds?  Are they big enough?</p>

<blockquote><p>Background Evidence-based medicine is valuable to the extent that the evidence base is complete and unbiased. Selective publication of clinical trials — and the outcomes within those trials — can lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent risk–benefit ratio.<br />Methods We obtained reviews from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for studies of 12 antidepressant agents involving 12,564 patients. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify matching publications. For trials that were reported in the literature, we compared the published outcomes with the FDA outcomes. We also compared the effect size derived from the published reports with the effect size derived from the entire FDA data set.<br />Results Among 74 FDA-registered studies, 31%, accounting for 3449 study participants, were not published. Whether and how the studies were published were associated with the study outcome. A total of 37 studies viewed by the FDA as having positive results were published; 1 study viewed as positive was not published. Studies viewed by the FDA as having negative or questionable results were, with 3 exceptions, either not published (22 studies) or published in a way that, in our opinion, conveyed a positive outcome (11 studies). According to the published literature, it appeared that 94% of the trials conducted were positive. By contrast, the FDA analysis showed that 51% were positive. Separate meta-analyses of the FDA and journal data sets showed that the increase in effect size ranged from 11 to 69% for individual drugs and was 32% overall.<br />Conclusions We cannot determine whether the bias observed resulted from a failure to submit manuscripts on the part of authors and sponsors, from decisions by journal editors and reviewers not to publish, or both. Selective reporting of clinical trial results may have adverse consequences for researchers, study participants, health care professionals, and patients.</p></blockquote>
<p>This may be good for sales, but witholding limitations from doctors at least in theory is bad medicine. Of course, there are other difficulties.</p>

<blockquote><p>The cultivation of opium poppies whose product is turned into heroin is spreading rapidly across Iraq as farmers find they can no longer make a living through growing traditional crops.</p>
<p>Afghan with experience in planting poppies have been helping farmers switch to producing opium in fertile parts of Diyala province, once famous for its oranges and pomegranates, north- east of Baghdad.</p>
<p>At a heavily guarded farm near the town of Buhriz, south of the provincial capital Baquba, poppies are grown between the orange trees in order to hide them, according to a local source.</p>
<p>The shift by Iraqi farmers to producing opium was first revealed by The Independent last May and is a very recent development. The first poppy fields, funded by drug smugglers who previously supplied Saudi Arabia and the Gulf with heroin from Afghanistan, were close to the city of Diwaniyah in southern Iraq. The growing of poppies has now spread to Diyala, which is one of the places in Iraq where al-Qa&#8217;ida is still resisting US and Iraqi government forces. It is also deeply divided between Sunni, Shia and Kurd and the extreme violence means that local security men have little time to deal with the drugs trade. The speed with which farmers are turning to poppies is confirmed by the Iraqi news agency al-Malaf Press, which says that opium is now being produced around the towns of Khalis, Sa&#8217;adiya, Dain&#8217;ya and south of Baladruz, pointing out that these are all areas where al-Qa&#8217;ida is strong.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The move of local warlords, both Sunni and Shia, into opium farming is a menacing development in Iraq, where local political leaders are often allied to gangsters. The theft of fuel, smuggling and control of government facilities such as ports means that gangs are often very rich. It is they, rather than impoverished farmers, who have taken the lead in financing and organising opium production in Iraq.</p>
<p>Initial planting in fertile land west and south of Diwaniya around the towns of Ash Shamiyah, al-Ghammas and Shinafiyah were said to have faced problems because of the extreme heat and humidity. Al-Malaf Press says that it has learnt that the experiments with opium poppy-growing in Diyala have been successful.</p>
<p>Although opium has not been grown in many of these areas in Iraq in recent history, some of the earliest written references to opium come from ancient Iraq. It was known to the ancient Sumerians as early as 3400BC as the &#8220;Hul Gil&#8221; or &#8220;joy plant&#8221; and there are mentions of it on clay tablets found in excavations at the city of Nippur just east of Diwaniyah.</p></blockquote>
<p>Warlords growing opium.  If this is accurate, its just another way Iraq is following in the Afghanistan mold.</p>

<p>While reading about days gone by, I ran across this account, from which I have filed off the serial numbers for the purpose of more clarity:</p>
<blockquote><p>The crash followed a speculative boom &#8230; which had led hundred of thousands of Americans to invest heavily &#8230; a significant number even borrowing money to buy more&#8230;  brokers were routinely lending small investors more than 2/3 of the face value &#8230;</p>
<p>The rising … prices encouraged more people to invest; people hoped the … prices would rise further. Speculation thus fueled further rises and created an economic bubble.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>… the market finally turned down, and panic selling started&#8230;</p>
<p>… Congress … mandated a separation between commercial banks, which take deposits and extend loans, and investment banks, which underwrite, issue, and distribute stocks, bonds, and other securities.</p>
<p>The … crash had a major impact on the U.S. and world economy… The crash marked the beginning of widespread and long-lasting consequences for the United States.</p>
<p>The decline in … prices caused bankruptcies and severe macroeconomic difficulties including business closures, firing of workers and other economic repression measures. The resultant rise of mass unemployment and the depression is seen as a direct result of the crash … it is usually seen as having the greatest impact on the events that followed.</p>
<p>Therefore [it] is widely regarded as signaling the downward economic slide &#8230;</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>According to the economist Milton Friedman … the Federal Reserve in the immediate aftermath of the crash did not sufficiently expand the money supply and so turned the recession into a depression.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>This post is by Coberly, and was written for inclusion in the upcoming <a href="http://www.facingup.org/">Facing Up</a> blog carnival on Social Security.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The idea that Something Needs To Be Done About Social Security is rooted in three fundamental misunderstandings.  A misunderstanding about the very nature of Social Security, a misunderstanding about what the Trust Fund is, and a misunderstanding about the numbers:  how big they are and what they mean.</p>
<p>It’s as if your doctor, your boss, and your financial planner all came into your office and announced they had good news and they had bad news.  Your doctor says he is going to extend your life expectancy by six years.  Your boss says he is going to give you a 300 dollar per week raise. </p>
<p>“So what’s the bad news?”  </p>
<p>Your financial planner tells you that you are going to have to save an extra 20 dollars a week in order to pay for that extra six years in retirement.<br />Of course this is not usually the way the news is presented.  Instead a nice man in a suit tells you he is a “non partisan expert” and “SOCIAL SECURITY IS GOING BROKE! FLAT BUST! IT’S GOING TO BE A CRUSHING BURDEN ON YOUR CHILDREN!”</p>
<p>The source of this misunderstanding is that most people don’t read, can’t read, or deliberately misread the Social Security Trustees Report.   [The 2007 Annual Report of the Trustees of the Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds.  A web copy can be found <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR07/trTOC.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the facts: The Social Security Trustees report a projected deficit in Social Security finances of 4.7 Trillion Dollars over the next seventy five years [Trustees Report, page 2].  A good place to begin understanding what this means is to make a rough calculation of approximately what it might mean to you:  There are about 200 million taxpayers in America, so 4.7 Trillion divided by 200 million is 23,500 dollars per taxpayer, divided by 75 years is 313 dollars per taxpayer per year, or about six dollars a week.</p>
<p>This is just back of the envelope, but it should give you a sense of the scale of the problem:  not very big.  The Trustees do the hard arithmetic, using &#8220;present value” and all the right details about timing and interest rates, and&#8230;  tell you what the answer is: An immediate increase in the combined payroll tax of 1.95% would close the deficit [Trustees Report, p 3]. But that&#8217;s combined. What you would see is about 1% for you and 1% for your boss.  Average pay is about 37,000 dollars per year, or about 700 dollars per week.  1% of 700 dollars is 7 dollars per week.</p>
<p>However, the Trustees know we can&#8217;t start paying for the projected deficit right away because, well, because it hasn&#8217;t happened yet.  And paying more now would just increase the amount of the national debt&#8230;  those “worthless iou&#8217;s” in the Trust Fund are debt, after all.  So they dolefully point out [p 16 of the report] that if we wait until the money actually comes due, in about 2040, it would require an increase in the combined payroll tax of about 4% &#8230;  or 2% (about 14 dollars a week) for you, and 2% for your boss.  They don&#8217;t point out, but you can find it  if you are a careful reader, that by 2040, assuming, as they do [p 87], an increase in real income of 1.1% per year over that time, the average real wage will have increased by 300 dollars a week (to about 1000 dollars per week, or 50,000 per year)&#8230;.and of course the tax on the larger income will be bigger&#8230; about 20 dollars per week. So there&#8217;s your crisis:  30 years from now a 20 dollar per week increase in the tax on an income that is 300 dollars per week larger.</p>
<p>And that money, those extra 20 dollars per week, is not thrown into a government black hole:  You get it back, with enough effective interest to cover inflation (and more, depending on the rise in real wages) when you need it most.  The reason for the raise in the tax is that you are going to be living longer, spending a larger percent of your life retired, so you will need to save a larger percent of your income.  But that &#8220;larger&#8221; is 2%, not 50%, not 100%, not “the value of all the property in America” as Peter Peterson likes to say.</p>
<p>Another way to look at this:  The Trustees say that by 2041 under current tax rates they will only be able to meet 75% of promised benefits [p16].  This means taxes would have to be raised 33% to meet all promised benefits.  But that is 33% of a 6.2% tax. or about 2.1% of payroll.  2% of 700 dollars is 14 dollars per week.  But by then you will be making 1000 dollars/week.  2% of 1000 dollars is 20 dollars.</p>
<p>I am repeating this because I want to be sure you get it.  We are talking about a twenty dollar per week tax increase&#8230; on an income that is 300 dollars more per week than you have today&#8230; in order to pay for your own longer retirement. This is not a crisis.  It is not even a problem.</p>
<p>The Trustees suggest that instead of paying the 2% tax increase, we could cut benefits by 25% [p 16].  But benefits are about 1000 dollars per month.  Cutting them by 25% would leave you trying to get by on 750 dollars per month. No fun. <br />Ask your financial planner what makes more sense&#8230;  raising your tax by 60 dollars per month (using today’s values) out of an income of 3000 dollars per month, or cutting your benefits 250 dollars per month out of a pension of 1000 dollars per month?</p>
<p>Some say we should raise the retirement age.  That&#8217;s easy to say when you are young, or have a really good job.  But the fact is that most people, when they have a choice, choose to retire early rather than late, even if it means getting less money.  And it  conveniently ignores the fact that these old people WILL HAVE PAID FOR THEIR OWN RETIREMENT.</p>
<p>These are the choices, but the fast talking man in the suit isn&#8217;t going to give you a chance to think about them. Once you have got the SIZE of the problem fixed in your mind, you are ready to think about the other two fundamental misunderstandings.</p>
<p>The first of these is the Trust Fund.  The Trust Fund is NOT Social Security.  When Bush tells you that Social Security will be “broke, flat bust,” he is lying.   The current Trust Fund was created so the Baby Boomers could pay in advance for their own retirement.  The Trust Fund was always intended to run out of money&#8230; go &#8220;broke&#8221;&#8230;at about the time the last of the Boomers were dying off. It looks like it will have done its job by about 2040. When the Trust Fund is fully paid out, Social Security returns to pay as you go. It can never run out of money&#8230;as long as America stands, as long as the workers want a safe way to save for their own retirement.</p>
<p>In fact, the Trust Fund doesn&#8217;t matter very much.  The cost of paying it off will amount to a tax raise of ONE DOLLAR PER WEEK each year from 2016 to about 2036 [p 44 TableIV.B1.],  during a time when the average wage is increasing TEN dollars per week each year.</p>
<p>The last fundamental misunderstanding is the nature of Social Security itself.  Social Security is not welfare.  The rich do not pay for the poor.  The young do not pay for the old.  It is not “government money.”</p>
<p>There is a certain magic to pay as you go with wage indexing that only the Federal government can accomplish.  The government can guarantee you get your money back safe from inflation, safe from market gyrations, safe from illness or theft.  It can even insure you against failing to make enough money over a lifetime to have saved enough for basic needs in retirement. But no one pays any more into Social Security than they expect to get back.</p>
<p>Pay as you go is fundamentally no different from  putting your money into the bank or buying a stock.  The day you put your money in, it goes right out the back door to pay for someone else&#8217;s expenses.  And when you are ready to take your money out&#8230;  it has to come in the front door from someone else who is buying your stock, or buying your company&#8217;s products so the company can pay you dividends. </p>
<p>Under ANY retirement plan it is always “the young” that pay for “the old.”  The young do it because they know that it is a good deal for them:  one day they will be &#8220;the old.&#8221;</p>

<p>And here’s why Gold fell yesterday and today, and FX currencies incl Swiss Francs and even Yen this morning – from head of International trading at Everbank:</p>
<p>“Anyway&#8230; All this led to a very strong currency rally, only to see the trap door spring on the rally mid-morning&#8230; What was once some lofty levels, soon turned south&#8230; I searched and searched for a reason, but there was nothing to be found&#8230; So&#8230; Turning on my years of experience with currencies, I said&#8230; This must be: A. profit taking B. technical correction or C. selling to get money to pay for margin calls.</p>
<p>Yes, those dreaded margin calls which must be flying off the desks of margin clerks these days&#8230; Stocks sold off 200 points from the get go&#8230; And I then looked at the Dow Jones Industrial Avg. and in the last two months, it is off about 1,000 points, from 13,500 to 12,500&#8230; OUCH!</p>
<p>Did I ever tell you that long ago in a far away galaxy, I worked as a margin clerk, and eventually the Margin Manager? We used to have to call people when extra margin was needed and I hated those calls&#8230; I had a margin clerk that worked for me that once called a dentist, and told him that his account had a huge cavity, and needed to be filled immediately or he&#8217;d have to pull it&#8230; We all laughed hysterically, but the poor dentist didn&#8217;t think it was so funny&#8230; “</p>
<p>Why get margin calls?  Because speculators were Long (owned shares) in risky Emerging Market and other export-dependent countries which fell like a stone yesterday, and may do the same from time to time for the next couple of months, at least.</p>
<p>I knew there was some kind of explanation.  Looks like the entire Japanese stock market got a margin call.</p>

<blockquote><p>Consumer prices rose in 2007 at the fastest pace in 17 years as motorists paid a lot more for gasoline and grocery shoppers paid higher food bills. However, falling prices for clothing and new cars offset some of those gains.</p>
<p>The Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose by 4.1 percent for all of 2007, up sharply from a 2.5 percent increase in 2006. Both energy and food prices jumped by the largest amount since 1990.</p>
<p>Prices were also up sharply for health care, housing and education. However, these gains were offset somewhat by falling prices for clothing, new cars and computers.</p>
<p>Workers&#8217; wages failed to keep up with the higher inflation. Average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, dropped by 0.9 percent in 2007, the fourth decline in the past five years. The lagging wage gains are cited as a chief reason many workers have growing anxiety about their economic futures.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Providing further evidence of a slowing economy, the Fed reported that output at the nation&#8217;s factories was flat in December, the worst showing since an outright decline of 0.5 percent in October. Economists said that poor reading confirmed their view that the manufacturing sector has slipped into a recession.</p>
<p>In a separate report, the Fed said its latest survey of economic conditions around the country showed the economy was losing momentum heading into 2008 although seven of the 12 Fed regions did report slight increases in activity.</p>
<p>The mounting signs of economic weakness have greatly raised concerns that the economy could be slipping into a recession. Unemployment jumped from 4.7 percent in November to 5 percent in December, the biggest one-month increase since the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks. Many of the nation&#8217;s biggest financial institutions have been reporting billions of dollars in losses, reflecting the meltdown in the subprime mortgage market that was triggered by a two-year long slump in housing.</p>
<p>The December weakness in industrial production reflected flat output at U.S. factories. For the year, output at auto plants fell by 4.1 percent as Detroit continues to struggle with falling demand in the face of soaring gasoline prices. Industries connected to the troubled housing sector including wood products and furniture also suffered big declines for the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that today&#8217;s report confirms that manufacturing is in a recession,&#8221; said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI. &#8220;General growth in exports and a few bright spots in aerospace, high tech and medical equipment cannot mitigate weak consumer spending and increasingly slow and cautious business investment activity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, people who don&#8217;t ask <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/why-is-economy-in-trouble-seriously-why.html">this question</a> will suggest tax cuts as the perennial solution to everything&#8230;</p>

Actually, it does propose an idea, but I left that out. To quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;During his speech at the Union League Club of Chicago on Jan. 7, Bush reiterated the importance of continuing his current policies to address what he calls recent economic &#8220;challenges.&#8221; However, he emphasized that new initiatives are unnecessary to address the damage from the housing and financial crises. Bush called for extending his first-term tax cuts, few of which, if any, would have any impact on current economic signals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Paulson, in his speech before the New York Society of Security Analysts, Inc., said the administration would consider an economic stimulus package but would not provide any details. This is why some speculated that Bush might announce something during the State of Union address.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>It is important that policy makers ignore calls for a repetition of the failed 2001-2003 Bush tax cuts and adhere to sound economic principles as described by Summers and Orszag. Even worse would be calls for extension of those same tax cuts as a short-term solution for current fiscal problems. Permanent tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations would do little to immediately stimulate the economy or direct economic aid to those most affected by an economic slump while ultimately putting a drag on the economy in the long term through sustained budget deficits.<br />&#8230;</p>
<p>(The views expressed are those of mine alone and should not be attributed to the trustees, officers, or staff of the Brookings Institution or the Tax Policy Center. Much of this talk draws upon joint work with William Gale of Brookings, Robert Greenstein and Richard Kogan of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Robert Rubin of Citigroup, and Allen Sinai of Decision Economics, Inc. I also thank Robert Cumby of Georgetown University, Peter Diamond of MIT, Doug Elmendorf and David Wilcox of the Federal Reserve, Robert Bixby of the Concord Coalition, and Maya MacGuineas of the New America Foundation for helpful discussions.)</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Here is some <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGVkMzEwYzQ2ZmUyM2VmMTA1MzVhMmVhMGY3OGM1YWQ=">Sowellizing</a> at the National Review:</p>
<blockquote><p>But these runaway housing prices in California did not just happen, for no reason.</p>
<p>Prior to 1970, California housing prices were very similar to housing prices in the rest of the country. In more recent times, it has not been uncommon for California homes to cost three times what homes cost nationwide.</p>
<p>What happened in the 1970s was that severe government restrictions on building became common in coastal California. With supply restricted and demand not restricted, it was inevitable that prices would soar beyond many people’s ability to pay.</p>
<p>The main impetus behind severe restrictions on building is environmentalist zealots who demand that vast amounts of land be set aside as “open space” on which nothing can be built.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Behind much of the lofty and pretty talk are some ugly and selfish realities.</p>
<p>People who already own their homes in an upscale community pay no price for making it hard for others to move into their community. On the contrary, the value of the homes they already own shoots up when they restrict the supply of new homes.</p>
<p>In other words, they can keep out the less affluent people — or, as they put it, “preserve the character of the community” — while benefiting themselves economically in the name of green idealism.</p>
<p>“Open space” laws are just one of the weapons in their arsenal. Other legal impediments to building include so-called “smart growth” policies, historical preservation laws, and zoning boards and coastal commissions with arbitrary powers to limit or forbid building.</p></blockquote>
<p>I did a quick google search and found  <a href="http://www.clevelandfed.org/Research/Commentary/2007/0707.cfm">a paper</a> at the Fed of Cleveland&#8217;s site, which produces this graph:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R435QNumL-I/AAAAAAAAA9U/0coKU3iz2xU/s1600-h/national+house+and+land+price+indexes.gif"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R435QNumL-I/AAAAAAAAA9U/0coKU3iz2xU/s320/national+house+and+land+price+indexes.gif" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>FWIW, it seems that prices took off not just in CA but across the country in the 1970s.  That doesn&#8217;t mean a disparity didn&#8217;t occur between CA prices and the rest of the nation &#8211; but it would imply that at least some of what was happening in CA in the 1970s was also happening elsewhere in the country (assuming these indexes (indices?) took into account inflation).</p>
<p>I was hoping to find year by year historical pricing data on CA and the US to see exactly when prices in CA started to take off relative to the US&#8230;  but after a few minutes I gave up.  If anyone has the data, I&#8217;ll be happy to go into this a bit more on a later post.</p>
<p>But I would like to point out there&#8217;s one thing that has helped push up home prices in CA quite a bit that Sowell doesn&#8217;t mention&#8230;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_13_(1978)">Proposition 13</a>, which passed in 1978, put a cap on property taxes.  Considering the high inflation at the time, it wouldn&#8217;t take long to push up the benefits of not selling or moving to many home-owners.  As an example, if my mother were to rent out her home&#8230; the monthly rent would be at least twice her yearly property tax. If she moves&#8230; even to an equivalent home, her property taxes will go up several times.  And she will tell you, if you ask &#8211; one of the reasons she will not move is because of her property taxes.</p>
<p>Put another way&#8230;  Proposition 13 serves the same function for home-owners as rent control serves for those who rent apartments.  It makes winners of those who are already in, and penalizes those who are out by reducing the incentives of those who are in from moving and raising the prices of existing property.  But this is a measure that a) involves tax avoidance and b) benefits the haves at the expense of the have-nots.  So of course, a guy like Sowell would never mention this as one of the issues driving up home prices.  </p>
<p>As he states as he closes his piece:  &#8220;Apparently it all depends on whose ox is gored.&#8221;  And Sowell is not one to gore an ox that belongs to people who have a lot of  &#8217;em.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update&#8230; added the words &#8220;that Sowell doesn&#8217;t mention&#8221; to one of the sentences for clarity of meaning.</p>

<p>It has come to my attention that the DoD is thinking about using propranolol as a prophylactic to help reduce ptsd symptoms during conflict and after. I had found <a href="http://www.alternet.org/healthwellness/72956/">this article</a>from a wife of a soldier who had killed himself, and who had testified in a Dec. 12, 2007 congressional hearing on suicide among veterans that is apparently on the rise.  She has a strong and passionate viewpoint, but that is not for the post.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propranolol">Propranolol</a> (brand name Inde by Wyeth) is used for a number of diagnosis not related to ptsd.  In addition it is used in the psychological Anxiety area as a beta blocker among other uses,  for example for rape victims  ptsd to help defuse the intensity of the experience in order to work in therapy.  Its efficacy is still experimental and not encouraging.</p>
<p>Failing to locate such information, I am wondering if readers may have leads.  While an econ blog, many here are also veterans.  Thanks.  Further information is coming if warranted.  I have e-mailed relevant experts that I know.</p>
