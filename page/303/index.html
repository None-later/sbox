<p>Senators Brown (R-MA), Snowe (R-ME) and Collins (R-ME) have indicated that they will support the financial reform package.  Along with Maria Cantwell, who had hesitated because of the bill&#8217;s relative weakness at correcting the key problems that caused the financial crisis, it appears the bill is headed to passage by the Senate this week.  See Financial Times, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/a6f8daf0-8ddf-11df-9153-00144feab49a,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Fa6f8daf0-8ddf-11df-9153-00144feab49a.html&#038;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fataxingmatter.blogs.com%2Ftax%2F2010%2F07%2Fdoddfrank-bill-closer-to-passage-as-republicans-sign-on.html">Wall Street Reform Proposal Wins Key Support</a>, July 12, 2010.</p>
<p>Perhaps the weakest part of the bill is its failure to definitively wean big banks from the risky (but lucrative, as long as the US picks up their losses) derivatives business and investments in hedge funds and similar entities.  Naked credit default swaps, the critical derivatives that permitted banks to become interconnected casinos gambling on ups and downs in companies without owning a cent of their equity or bonds (an insurance product without insurance regulation to prevent moral hazard), are essentially unregulated in the conference report agreement.  The Fed will have the power to regulate them, but the Fed has long been in bed with the banks and has insufficient independence to recognize the depth of the problem.  Moving most derivatives into subsidiaries is not the same as spinning them off entirely into separate entities.  The banks won on this one, and this was the most important stake in the bundle.</p>
<p>While the consumer protection agency is much needed, it is weaker than it should be.  It is under the Fed, which can veto rules if the Fed thinks they pose a risk for banks.  Since banks always say that any rule that limits their profits poses a risk, this will be a constant worry for consumer protection rules.  Further, auto dealers&#8211;one of the primary issuers of credits to ordinary consumers&#8211;lobbied for and won exemption from the agency&#8217;s rules.  Of course, every Congressman has auto dealers in his or her district, but you&#8217;d think that the thousands of car buyers in each district who will fall prey to any shucksterism from auto dealers would garner more of the reps/ attention.</p>
<p>Finally, Brown&#8217;s vote was a costly one.  He was one who fought to permit banks to own hedge funds&#8211;essentially a decision to allow them to continue to gamble with other people&#8217;s money.  And he nixed the proposal to have the banks pay for the cost of increased regulation due to their risky behavior.  Why in the world shouldn&#8217;t the banks pay?  I suppose they must have contributed a good deal to Brown&#8217;s campaign chest.  There&#8217;s no other reason for failing to assess the banks their fair share of the added monitoring costs.</p>
<p>What convinces me that this bill is much too weak is that the banks are satisfied that they won sufficiently to keep doing business as usual.</p>

<p><strong>Why conservative lies_spread_and what progressives can do to fight them</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Fit matters. The brain is a &#8220;best-fit&#8221; system. The better a new frame &#8220;fits&#8221; existing frames, the more effective it will be; that is, the more people will think, and make decisions, using that frame</p>
<p>For important domains of thought, like morality, religion, and politics, it is commonplace for people to have two inconsistent frame systems that inhibit each other&#8230; When you can shift back and forth on an issue, you are bi-conceptual on that issue. That is, you can frame the issue in two ways, using inconsistent higher-level frame systems.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The more the language of frame is repeated, the stronger the frame gets, along with the system the frame is in. And the weaker the frames of the contradictory system gets. The stronger high-level frames are, the more effective frames that fit them will be. And the less effective frames that contradict them will be.<br />&#8230;<br />Frames are conceptual; they are the elements of thought. Most thought is unconscious. Words activate frames. We are rarely conscious of the frames that are activated by the words we hear. Yet those frames are there in our brain circuitry, and more we hear the words, the stronger the frames get, even though we aren&#8217;t aware of it.<br />&#8230;<br />Framing is the establishment of permanent (or long-term) high-level frames and systems of frames with the brains of voters&#8230;<br />&#8230;<br />An important part of framing is the establishment of prototypes: social stereotypes, prototypes (typical case, ideals, nightmares, salient exemplars). Stereotypes are used in automatic reasoning and decision-making.<br />&#8230;<br />This messaging system has existed and has been extended and strengthened over many years. Democrats have a few of these elements, but they are relatively ineffective, since they tend to view messaging as short-term and issue-based, rather than long-term and morally based. Democrats tend not to understand how framing works, and often confuse framing (which is deep, long-term, systematic, morality-based, and conceptual) with messaging (which is shallow, short-term, ad hoc, policy-based, and linguistic).</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<a name="more"></a><br />Democrats have a few of these elements, but they are relatively ineffective, since they tend to view messaging as short-term and issue-based, rather than long-term and morally based. Democrats tend not to understand how framing works, and often confuse framing (which is deep, long-term, systematic, morality-based, and conceptual) with messaging (which is shallow, short-term, ad hoc, policy-based, and linguistic).<br />&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>The &#8220;evidence&#8221; comes from polls and focus groups that test the normal &#8220;mainstream&#8221; language and logic, versus language and logic that is not &#8220;mainstream.&#8221; This is, naturally, conservative language and logic, because the conservative messaging system has systematically made it that way patiently over years. The pollsters therefore report that the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; of Americans prefer the conservative language and logic, and the policies that go with them. The pollsters then suggest moving to right to go to where the public is. They then construct and test messages that move enough to right to satisfy the &#8220;mainstream.&#8221; They also construct &#8220;good arguments.&#8221; If the &#8220;good arguments&#8221; activate the conservative worldview, the conservative position will just get stronger in the brains of the voters.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote> To work long-term, progressive messaging must be sincere and direct, must reflect progressive moral values, and must be repeated. Progressive framing is about saying what you believe, telling the truth, and activating the progressive worldview already present in the minds of those who are partly conservative and partly progressive.</p>
<p>Framing is, of course, about policy, more than about messaging. What you say should go hand-in-hand with what you think and do.</p>
<p>And, of course, the best messaging requires an excellent communications system, or it won&#8217;t be heard. Progressives have the money to build such a system. The question is whether they understand the desperate need for such a system, and whether they have the will to build it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course the comments on the post settled nothing.  The post is long on intellectual type of thought and short on examples.  But it is instructive to note that the energy behind a belief is not something that ebbs and flows simply by vote counts, it is something enduring demanding resources and effort on a daily basis by bearing witness in big and small ways. </p>
<p>And the confusion between &#8216;frame&#8217; and &#8216;message&#8217; is constantly displayed in comments when it comes to political messaging&#8230;especially in a forced two party system.  </p>
<p>To illustrate, allowing the labels &#8216;pro-life&#8217; and &#8216;pro-choice&#8217; to define the abortion issue was a major mistake from my point of view.  &#8216;Anti-choice&#8217; keeps the label to the issue and does not allow &#8216;pro-life&#8217; groups kudos for things not included in their agenda.</p>
<p>Lakoff uses the immigration debate as an illustration, but I wish he would develop better stories.  The use of the term &#8216;illegals&#8217; is a pejorative, but even Mitt Romney trusted illegals to come into his house in MA to take advantage of their work ethic.  Americans often invite illegals into their homes and even leave them to walk around unattended, and ask them to care for their children, or cook their meals.  There are some bad apples, but crime is down despite this invasion.</p>
<p>More to come.</p>

<p>(My God, can we get any more jargony and wonkish? Well &#8220;Si, Si, Puede!&#8221;)</p>
<p>When the Greenspan Commission was convened back in 1982 Social Security scoring started and stopped with the SSA Office of the Chief Actuary who are also tasked with researching, compiling and presenting the Annual Report for review and signing by the Trustees, many of whom may not have any relevant training. OACT is by statute and tradition a professional and non-partisan group of technocrats. Sometime after 1983 the role of scoring Social Security started being shared with the Congressional Budget Office, also by statute and tradition a professional and non-partisan group of technocrats. What is more CBO formally agrees to accept OACT demographic projections. So you would expect the top line numbers of both to come in pretty close alignment in regards to Trust Fund Depletion. Well you would be wrong, CBO and OACT have in the past seen pretty wide variations in dates of TF depletion and total actuarial gap. Now in the past decade or so this didn&#8217;t matter much because even the Bush push for Social Security reform never made it as far as the legislative process, to my knowledge no bills were submitted, meaning no official CBO scoring. Moreover in the normal course of events there was enough lag between the reporting by SSA and CBO that the divergence between them could go unnoticed since neither stayed in the news past a news cycle or two anyway.</p>
<p>Well this year is different. We have a presidential Deficit Commission which has already announced a focus on &#8216;Entitlements&#8217;, including Social Security, and are prepared to make a recommendation in December, which recommendation if passed through the Senate was last week guaranteed a vote by the House. Meaning that this year the question of scoring is going to come to the fore, in selecting a package of SS &#8216;reforms&#8217; whose score is going to have the final say? I put this question to a panel of experts with decades of experience and while some gave me pretty definitive answers the consensus was &#8220;Bruce, that is an awfully good question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Report geekery below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The two main sources of Social Security scoring are the Annual Reports of the Trustees of Social Security, normally released on March 31st and available <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html">here</a>, and CBOs Long Term Projection for Social Security, normally released in August and available <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/publications/bysubject.cfm?cat=11">here</a>. This five month gap normally results in SSA numbers being internalized in the MSM, with few reporters or columnists noting the difference, with a major exception of Dean Baker, who for a variety of reasons tends to go with CBO numbers.</p>
<p>Well a funny thing happened this year, the Social Security Report did not come out on March 31st, it didn&#8217;t even come out on the semi-official revised date of June 30th, and Treasury refuses to commit to a firm date even now, with the best guesses on Capitol Hill suggesting sometime in August. Now there is no reason to suggest that CBO will experience a similar delay they came out with their Long Term Budget Outlook (which has a Social Security component) on time and also released a scoring of thirty different <a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=1142">Social Security Policy Options</a> on July 1st. So best available information as of this minute is that we will have two dueling Reports coming out head to head right in time to inform the decision making of the Deficit Commission.</p>
<p>So which one rules? Well we got an interesting hint in an article (interesting in itself) detailing some internal strife in SSA between Commissioner Astrue and Chief Actuary Steve Goss published in the NYT on July 11: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/us/politics/11benefits.html?_r=1&#038;hpw">Lawmakers Defend Social Security’s Chief Actuary in Clash With Commissioner</a>. The following two sentences jumped out at me (bolding mine):<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Goss’s responsibilities have suddenly increased. Leaders of a presidential commission seeking ways to reduce the federal budget deficit said they would rely exclusively on his estimates to measure the financial effects of proposals to overhaul Social Security</p></blockquote>
<p> Which suggests that for the Commission&#8217;s purposes when it comes to Social Security and  Medicare CBO is locked out. But can they equally lock out CBO when it comes time to other spending and tax suggestions? Can they just agree to look at one part of a data table while ignoring another that mentions Social Security?</p>
<p>And  whatever the Commission decides what happens when the package hits Congress? In 1983 there was no CBO long term scoring of Social Security, and a Congressional staffer who worked on the legislative package confirmed to me that at least House Ways and Means and probably Senate Finance relied exclusively on OACT. Then again they didn&#8217;t have a lot of choice. But in 2010 we know from observation of the Stimulus and HCR legislative process that budget bills BY RULE live or die based on CBO scoring.</p>
<p>To which some people will suggest that it doesn&#8217;t matter much, after all the 2009 Social Security Report put the long-term gap at 0.7% of GDP while the most recent CBO scoring puts it at 0.6% of GDP. On the other hand the gap between the 2009 SS Report and the 2010 looks to have stretched out by 15 months (May 13th to mid-August) and performance of Social Security, particularly on the Disability Insurance side, was MUCH more miserable than expected, we can expect OACT to bump that 0.7% up a bit. Moreover each 0.1% of GDP represents maybe 0.3% of covered payroll, no one should be surprised to see CBO scoring the 75 year gap at 1.6% of payroll and OACT at 2.2%, this would simply mirror the similar gaps we saw in the respective 2008 and 2009 reporting.</p>
<p>Why is this gap important? Because a lot of the options on the table score right in that .2 of GDP/.6% of payroll gap between CBO and probable SSA, a package of three fixes designed to meet SSA scoring could be revised to two fixes and still meet the requirements of CBO, a seemingly balanced package coming out of the Commission could be transferred to an unbalanced, and based on history even more worker-unfriendly one, by Congress using CBO numbers to say strip out a cap increase proposal in favor of one focusing entirely on benefit cuts.</p>
<p>There may be little in this world more geekish than focusing on the fine points of CBO vs OACT scoring. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it is not important. Your future retirement may rest on which way this one leans.</p>

<p><strong>HEALTH CARE: Can Mom Live Forever?</strong></p>
<p>Many of us have had the experience of losing a parent. It is a life passage that is impossible to completely prepare for.</p>
<p>Problem is, mom is not going to live forever, and at some point aggressive care makes no sense &#8211; except to some of the children.</p>
<p>This puts the hospital, nursing home, doctors and nurses in tough predicaments. And it puts Medicare in a position to finance the care.</p>
<p>Physicians often take the path of least resistance &#8211; do what the family wants. Too often the patient is ping-ponged between the hospital and nursing home. Medicare may eventually slow down the revolving transfers by cutting payments, which leaves the doctors and nurses to face the family.</p>
<p>Withholding care can result in unnecessary suffering. Providing too much care may result in unnecessary suffering. </p>
<p>Talk to your parents if they are older. Try to get some agreement among siblings about possible scenarios. Face reality yourself if you are older. Consider a living will.</p>
<p>And even then you cannot anticipate the exact course of anyone&#8217;s life.   </p>

<p>CR notes that<br />
<blockquote>Many of the originators of the PLS mortgages are no longer in business (New Century, etc.), however most of the PLS issuers still exist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update:  From the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/12/AR2010071205164.html">The Washington Post</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Fannie and Freddie together own about $255 billion in private-label securities. These securities included subprime loans, which were extended to people with thin or weak credit histories, as well as exotic loans such as adjustable-rate mortgages known as option ARMs. Option ARMs allowed borrowers to treat their mortgages as credit accounts, paying a small minimum payment each month while their balance grew to an unsustainable size. </p>
<p>Later analysis has shown that these types of loans were sometimes made on fraudulent grounds &#8212; and that the companies that packaged the loans and sold them to investors didn&#8217;t perform the appropriate oversight to ensure they were on the up-and-up. </p>
<p>Freddie said in a recent regulatory filing that lenders owe it $4.8 billion, up 26 percent from three months earlier. The company said a third of its demands to lenders for compensation have gone unfulfilled for three months. Fannie doesn&#8217;t disclose similar numbers.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Went to Massacghusetts for the weekend, where I learned that Martha Coakley supports child rapists* and Scott Brown (R-MA Sen.) is a decent legislator who stands by his convictions, including his opposition to the Financial Services Reform Act, which principled action he takes because the act institutionalizes Too Big to Fail.  (This is also Russ Feingold&#8217;s argument against the bill, I believe.)</p>
<p>Up until then, the only thing I had heard about Mr. Brown&#8217;s opinion of the bill was that the $19 billion in taxes on TBTF institutions—which would be a drop in the bucket, but at least a marginal disincentive to some &#8220;Great Recession&#8221;-causing activities—was removed to make it more palatable to him.</p>
<p>If, instead, it were true that Mr. Brown&#8217;s opposition was principles, he would stand by his conviction that the bill would do more harm to the economy than good, instead of accepting a reduced cost to BofA and a greater if-a-crisis-occurs cost for MA taxpayers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/38206969">Oops.</a></p>
<p>Ah, well. Martha Coakley railroaded Louise Woodward** and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fells_Acres_Day_Care_Center_preschool_trial#Post_trial">reached a similar type of agreement with Cheryl Amirault LeFave</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Linda Beale, in a post that will eventually appears here as well, <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/07/doddfrank-bill-closer-to-passage-as-republicans-sign-on.html">sums up the reality of Brown&#8217;s position</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Brown&#8217;s vote was a costly one.  He was one who fought to permit banks to own hedge funds&#8211;essentially a decision to allow them to continue to gamble with other people&#8217;s money.  And he nixed the proposal to have the banks pay for the cost of increased regulation due to their risky behavior.  Why in the world shouldn&#8217;t the banks pay?  I suppose they must have contributed a good deal to Brown&#8217;s campaign chest.  There&#8217;s no other reason for failing to assess the banks their fair share of the added monitoring costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brown (Senator-<s>BofA</s>State Street [correction h/t <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/06/financial-regulation-bank-lobbies-won-on-derivatives-auto-dealer-lobbies-got-special-treatment.html">Linda Beale</a>]) it is.</p>
<p>*This is apparently because the grand jury she empaneled <a href="http://www.boston.com/yourtown/melrose/articles/2010/01/06/some_saw_coakley_as_lax_on_05_rape_case?mode=PF">chose not to indict Keith Winfield</a>, at the time a police officer in Somerville.</p>
<p>**Oops. Sorry.  This was not an objection raised by my correspondent. Whether the evidence of innocence is rather clearer here than in the Amirault cases is left as an exercise.</p>

Currently obesity is a problem for more of us than we care to admit, and most worrisome for kids.</p>
<blockquote><p>More recently, my wife [filmmaker Lori Silverbush] started mentoring a young girl from Brooklyn and she would come to the house and she would eat and then she’d say “Oh, I’m full. Can I bring this home?” And we realized what she was doing; she was bringing it home for her siblings.</p>
<p>When food stamps run out halfway through the month, these kids are hungry. And they’re fed sweetened juice water, just to put something in their stomach; it’s not nice.</p>
<p>…We had a Major General who testified that forty percent of new recruits going into the service fail out because they’re obese. It’s not from overfeeding. This is what people don’t understand: obesity is a symptom of poverty. It’s not a lifestyle choice where people are just eating and not exercising. It’s because kids – and this is the problem with school lunch right now – are getting sugar, fat, empty calories – lots of calories – but no nutrition.</p>
<p>…And they’re hungry, they’re eating more cheap food.</p></blockquote>

<p>In 2003 CBO published an Issue Brief illustrating the relative contribution of Aging and Real Benefit Growth to future Social Security spending called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/43xx/doc4380/07-01-SocSecAging.pdf">The Future Growth of Social Security: It’s Not Just Society’s Aging</a> with results graphed above:.</p>
<p>Discussion under the fold. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Approximately 55 percent of the higher spending is due to an expected increase in the number of beneficiaries, as the number of new claimants grows and as life expectancy rises. The Social Security trustees estimate that the population age 65 or older will increase from 37 million today to 75 million in 2035 and to 95 million in 2075. <br />Life expectancy for people currently age 65 is estimated to be 83 years. In 2035, it is estimated to be 85 years, and in 2075, 87 years. <br />The remaining 45 percent of the rise in spending is due to a projected increase in the real value of Social Security benefit checks. Under the trustees’ assumptions, the purchasing power of the average earner’s benefits at retirement is expected to nearly double between now and 2075.Source: Congressional Budget Office. </p></blockquote>
<p>This increase in purchasing power is the result of adjusting initial retirement benefits by real wage increases over the worker&#8217;s lifetime. The end result is that retirees share in both the upside and downside of economic growth, if Real Wage for workers is stagnant so do will be initial benefits, if on the other hand workers gain Real Wage increases in line with the traditional relation found between Productivity and Wage (something that broke down some the last decade) then the rising tide really will lift all boats.</p>
<p>A couple of further notes. If retirement benefits are projected to increase in real terms by close to 100% over the next 75 years, then a projected cut of 20-25% on Trust Fund exhaustion would STILL see those future workers with larger baskets of goods than similarly situated retirees (this is what we call &#8216;Rosser&#8217;s Equation&#8217;).</p>
<p>But this real term increase doesn&#8217;t come at the expense of younger workers still in the work force, at least not without some forced special pleading. The goal clearly shown in Fig 2 is to keep overall replacement values steady with each future generation just able to hold onto its share of the overall societal increase. This seems fair to me.</p>
<p>There are some that insist that if you &#8216;really&#8217; look at the numbers you will see that Social Security was simply too generous to earlier generations. How you reconcile this with these graphs showing that each generation will be able to afford a bigger basket of goods than their predessessor would seem difficult. Because arguments from ROI (but I could have had EVEN MORE, and screw Grandma) seem pretty hard-hearted and selfish. But perhaps someone can make the moral case in comments.</p>

<p><strong>How Changes in State &#038; Local Tax Burdens Affect Growth in Per Capita Income</strong></p>
<p>Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=105">Presimetrics Blog</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve had a number of posts recently looking at the effect of reductions in the tax burden during Presidential administrations or during (or just following) recessions and how those affected subsequent growth.  In each case, cutting the tax burden did not lead to faster growth.  In fact, the data shows that, contrary to theory, real economic growth tends to be slower following cuts in the tax burden than following hikes in the tax burden.  </p>
<p>As noted in <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=92"> my last post </a>, one common criticism, that there aren’t enough observations, is mooted by the fact that state and local level data seems to show the same thing.  But it occurs to me that I haven’t done this sort of an analysis at the state and local data in a while, so that’s what I’m going to do in this post.</p>
<p>The data I’m going to use in this post comes from the <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/"> Tax Foundation</a>.    Here’s how the Tax Foundation describes itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>The mission of the Tax Foundation is to educate taxpayers about sound tax policy and the size of the tax burden borne by Americans at all levels of government. From its founding in 1937, the Tax Foundation has been grounded in the belief that the dissemination of basic information about government finance is the foundation of sound policy in a free society. </p></blockquote>
<p>I would add to that – from what I can tell, their primary goal seems to be to convince people that lower taxes produce faster economic growth, which is something that contradicts all the data I’ve looked at so far.  Thus, though I don’t normally use data from advocacy groups, I figure it adds an interesting dimension to the analysis in this case.  </p>
<p>Anyway, the data I will use comes from <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sl_burden_1977-2008-200808072.xls"> this file </a>, and it shows the state &#038; local tax burdens and the per capita income for every state plus the District of Columbia for every year from 1977 to 2008.  Despite my trepidation, I’m going to trust the data.  </p>
<p>Now, showing results that involve three decades of data for all 50 states and the D of C (henceforth “the states”) graphically – which is what Michael Kanell and I tried to do in Presimetrics &#8211; isn’t easy.  Here is what I did in this case.  For every year for every state, I computed the change in the state &#038; local burden for the two subsequent years, and the growth rate in per capita income for the six years after that.  (Per capita income is not adjusted for inflation, but for the purposes I’m using it, that doesn’t matter.)  Thus, in 1977, I computed the change in the state &#038; tax burden for Alabama between 1977 and 1979, and the annualized change in per capita income from 1979 to 1985.  The same thing was done for every state, and for each state, it was performed for every year for which data was available.   Regular readers will recognize that I’ve used the 2 years of tax changes followed by 6 years of growth in the past when looking at data at the Presidential level.</p>
<p>Now, in some years, tax cutting was the norm.  In other years, most states hiked taxes.  So the trick is to compare relative performances.  If the tax cutting proponents are right, in general, the states that reduced tax burdens the most (or increased them by the least) in any given two year period should have the fastest growth in per capita income in the next six year period.   To check that, in each year, I divided states into three buckets with 17 states each.  The 17 biggest tax cutters over the next two years are placed in one bucket, the next 17 appear in the next bucket, and the last 17 are placed in the next bucket.  Obviously, a state won’t be in the same bucket every year.  The median growth rate in per capita income in the subsequent six years is computed for each bucket, and buckets are ranked according to whether they produced the fastest, second fastest, or third fastest growth rates in per capita income.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />For example… from 1977 to 1979, most states were in tax cutting mode.  The 17 states that cut taxes the most are placed in the “biggest tax cutters” group, the next 17 states are placed in the “medium tax cutters” group, and the 17 remaining states (including the D of C) are placed in the “smallest tax cutting” group.  Now, the biggest tax cutters produced a median annualized growth rate in per capita income from 1979 to 1985 of 7.8%.  By contrast, the median tax cutters from 1977 to 1979 enjoyed a median annualized growth of per capita income from 1979 to 1985 of 7.9%.  On the other hand, the smallest tax cutters produced a median growth in per capita income of 8.3% from 1979 to 1985.  Thus, for the 1977 year, we rank the smallest tax cutters as first, the median tax cutters as second, and the biggest tax cutters as third.</p>
<p>The following graph summarizes our results for all the years available:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDo_3S12LHI/AAAAAAAAAUQ/4Pu-nqIVX80/s1600/bucket1.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDo_3S12LHI/AAAAAAAAAUQ/4Pu-nqIVX80/s320/bucket1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>The table is interpreted as follows:  the smallest tax cutters (i.e., those who cut taxes the least or raised them the most in any given year) produced the fastest economic growth about 42% of the time, second about 29% of the time, and third 29% of the time.  By contrast, the middle group came in first in one third of all occasions.  The ”tax cuttingest” group came in first place a mere quarter of the time; in half of all years, it came in last place.</p>
<p>Many conclusions are reasonable from this.  However, concluding that states that cut taxes have produced the fastest growth rate in per capita income is not one of them.  After all, in general, the states that cut tax burdens in a two year period have, as often as not, turned in the worst performance when it comes to growth in per capita income in the following six years.  </p>
<p>Tying everything back to the work I’ve been showing in recent months (and which supports our findings in Presimetrics) – looking at data over the length of Presidential administrations since 1929 (when national accounts data became available), those Presidents that cut tax burdens in the early years tended to have worse real economic performance in later years than those that raised tax burdens.  Similarly cutting tax burdens during or just following a recession produces slower, shorter recoveries.  Now we find that cutting tax burdens isn’t the prescription at the state level either.    </p>
<p>I’ll repeat something I’ve noted before – any economic theory for which just about every observation is a special case is wrong.</p>

                                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/07/a-presidency-in-peril.html">Mark Thoma</a> hosted Robert Kuttner at <a target="_blank" href="http://firedoglake.com/2010/07/10/fdl-book-salon-welcomes-robert-kuttner-a-presidency-in-peril/#comments">Firedoglake</a>, the introduction begins with these words:</p>
<blockquote><p> It&#8217;s possible to give two very different interpretations of the Obama presidency so far. The first is a relatively positive interpretation. Proponents of this view argue that even though Obama has faced a united GOP willing and able to use filibusters to thwart initiatives, and even though he has had opposition within his own party to progressive initiatives, he has still managed to rack up an impressive list of achievements. Take health care as an example. The health care legislation wasn&#8217;t all that progressives wanted, not by a long shot. But the legislation is an impressive start and, importantly, it leaves the door open to further change. Though people forget, programs such as Social Security or Medicare weren&#8217;t perfect at first, but were improved substantially over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rdan here&#8230;I think two interpretations makes for a framing of the issue which is okay for a limited format and begins a conversation.  The HCA example was an early effort that does not quite define the problem, however, in that a case could be made for HCA as a reasonable first step, but still does not address the political methods used. Eventhough the result might be defensible at least to some, how does that accrue to the process and message that was also produced, which appeared to be more closely aligned to Pres. Obama&#8217;s policy stance to start? </p>
<blockquote><p>Proponents of this view also argue that a more aggressive posture would not have done any good, and it may have even been harmful&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Rdan..Some might argue this, but I think many held their concern in check more in confusion over the strategy and hopeful expectation in the beginning.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Obama doesn&#8217;t have FDR&#8217;s filibuster proof majority&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Rdan&#8230;Hmmmm&#8230;don&#8217;t buy this at all if it is indeed an argument&#8230;I believe it is an impression that is encouraged by DC, but choices were made.  There were early indications of the direction Pres. Obama had in mind by his choices for advisors.     </p>
<blockquote><p>The negative view, and this is the view taken in <strong>Robert Kuttner&#8217;s book</strong>, sees the last year and half very differently.</p>
<p>But &#8230; this hopeful scenario is not the way Barack Obama&#8217;s first year unfolded. Instead of making a radical break with Wall Street&#8230;This book is an exploration of why Obama did not rise to seize a Roosevelt moment. </p></blockquote>
<p>Mark Thoma notes:</p>
<blockquote><p> There doesn&#8217;t seem to be an urge to fight toe to toe and to take the case directly to the public in Reganesque style as a means of putting pressure on legislators to support the administration&#8217;s policy intitiatives. Instead, we get backroom deals that compromise away core principles. And all of this in the search of bipartisanship that turns out, in the end, to be nothing but Lucy and the football.</p></blockquote>
<p>Comments at Firedoglake were more varied than I expected, and comments at Economist View are worth a read.  However, the comments indicate a need to come to terms not only with issues but how to proceed with the situation as it stands.</p>
