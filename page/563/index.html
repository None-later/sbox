                                <p>Hat tip to vtcodger for this catch:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/09/central-banks-anticipate-mother-of-year.html">Naked Capitalism</a> makes a comment and uses Bloomberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>We noted a few weeks ago that between large amounts of short term financial firm debt maturing in the third and fourth quarters, banks still leery of lending to each other, and liquidity always lower at year end (banks pull back from the market to square off their books), this November-Decemeber looks to be even worse than last year, which was bad enough to lead to emergency intervention.</p>
<p>From Bloomberg:</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve may have to increase the cash it provides to banks and brokers, already a record, to help them balance their books at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Six bank failures in the past two months and rising concern about Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s capital levels pushed lenders&#8217; borrowing costs to near a four-month high yesterday. They may climb further as companies rush for cash to settle trades and buttress their balance sheets at year-end.</p>
<p>&#8220;This could be the mother of year-ends,&#8221; said Brian Sack, vice president of Macroeconomic Advisers LLC in Washington, who used to serve as head of monetary and financial market analysis at the Fed. &#8220;The markets will need extraordinary actions to get through it.&#8221;</p>
<p>One option is for banks and brokers to increase the loans they take out directly with the Fed; the central bank reports on the figures today. Officials could also offer options on its biweekly loan auctions or introduce special repurchase agreements to straddle the end of the year, economists said.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/09/mccains-integri.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> shares his thoughts on McCain:</p>
<blockquote><p>Editor&#8217;s Note: Historically a John McCain supporter, conservative journalist and blogger Andrew Sullivan takes on the issue of John McCain&#8217;s integrity as he strives to win the presidency. &#8211; vh/TO </p>
<p>    For me, this surreal moment &#8211; like the entire surrealism of the past ten days &#8211; is not really about Sarah Palin or Barack Obama or pigs or fish or lipstick. It&#8217;s about John McCain. The one thing I always thought I knew about him is that he is a decent and honest person. When he knows, as every sane person must, that Obama did not in any conceivable sense mean that Sarah Palin is a pig, what did he do? Did he come out and say so and end this charade? Or did he acquiesce in and thereby enable the mindless Rovianism that is now the core feature of his campaign? </p>
<p>    So far, he has let us all down. My guess is he will continue to do so. And that decision, for my part, ends whatever respect I once had for him. On core moral issues, where this man knew what the right thing was, and had to pick between good and evil, he chose evil. When he knew that George W. Bush&#8217;s war in Iraq was a fiasco and catastrophe, and before Donald Rumsfeld quit, McCain endorsed George W. Bush against his fellow Vietnam vet, John Kerry in 2004. By that decision, McCain lost any credibility that he can ever put country first. He put party first and his own career first ahead of what he knew was best for the country. </p>
<p>    And when the Senate and House voted overwhelmingly to condemn and end the torture regime of Bush and Cheney in 2006, McCain again had a clear choice between good and evil, and chose evil. </p>
<p>    He capitulated and enshrined torture as the policy of the United States, by allowing the CIA to use techniques as bad as and worse than the torture inflicted on him in Vietnam. He gave the war criminals in the White House retroactive immunity against the prosecution they so richly deserve. The enormity of this moral betrayal, this betrayal of his country&#8217;s honor, has yet to sink in. But for my part, it now makes much more sense. He is not the man I thought he was. </p>
<p>    And when he had the chance to engage in a real and substantive debate against the most talented politician of the next generation in a fall campaign where vital issues are at stake, what did McCain do? He began his general campaign with a series of grotesque, trivial and absurd MTV-style attacks on Obama&#8217;s virtues and implied disgusting things about his opponent&#8217;s patriotism. </p>
<p>    And then, because he could see he was going to lose, ten days ago, he threw caution to the wind and with no vetting whatsoever, picked a woman who, by her decision to endure her own eight-month pregnancy of a Down Syndrome child in public, that he was going to reignite the culture war as a last stand against Obama. That&#8217;s all that is happening right now: a massive bump in the enthusiasm of the Christianist base. This is pure Rove. </p>
<p>    Yes, McCain made a decision that revealed many appalling things about him. In the end, his final concern is not national security. No one who cares about national security would pick as vice-president someone who knows nothing about it as his replacement. No one who cares about this country&#8217;s safety would gamble the security of the world on a total unknown because she polled well with the Christianist base. No person who truly believed that the surge was integral to this country&#8217;s national security would pick as his veep candidate a woman who, so far as we can tell anything, opposed it at the time. </p>
<p>    McCain has demonstrated in the last two months that he does not have the character to be president of the United States. And that is why it is more important than ever to ensure that Barack Obama is the next president. The alternative is now unthinkable. And McCain &#8211; no one else &#8211; has proved it.</p></blockquote>

<p>rdan_How does one frame the condition of the economy rather than just financials to us kids in the back of the class who tend to throw spitballs??  Economy is growing for instance, according to some.  What is going on?</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Quit Doling Out That Bad-Economy Line</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/3tff3x"><br />By Donald Luskin</a>  Wapo<br />Sunday, September 14, 2008; B01</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the worst of times, and it was the worst of times.&#8221;</p>
<p>I imagine that&#8217;s what Charles Dickens would conclude about the current condition of the U.S. economy, based on the relentless drumbeat of pessimism in the media and on the campaign trail. In the past two months, this newspaper alone has written no fewer than nine times, in news stories, columns and op-eds, that key elements of the economy are the worst they&#8217;ve been &#8220;since the Great Depression.&#8221; That diagnosis has been applied twice to the housing &#8220;slump&#8221; and once to the housing &#8220;crisis,&#8221; to the &#8220;severe&#8221; decline in home prices, to the &#8220;spike&#8221; in mortgage foreclosures, to the &#8220;change&#8221; in the mortgage market and the &#8220;turmoil&#8221; in debt markets, and to the &#8220;crisis&#8221; or &#8220;meltdown&#8221; in financial markets.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a virus &#8212; and it&#8217;s spreading. Do a Google News search for &#8220;since the Great Depression,&#8221; and you come up with more than 4,500 examples of the phrase&#8217;s use in just the past month.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t make any of it true. Things today just aren&#8217;t that bad. Sure, there are trouble spots in the economy, as the government takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and jitters about Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers, amply demonstrate. And unemployment figures are up a bit, too. None of this, however, is cause for depression &#8212; or exaggerated Depression comparisons.</p>
<p>Overall, the pessimists are up against an insurmountable reality: In the last reported quarter, the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, adjusted for inflation. That&#8217;s virtually the same as the 3.4 percent average growth rate since &#8212; yes &#8212; the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Why, then, does the public appear to agree with the media? A recent Zogby poll shows that 66 percent of likely voters believe that &#8220;the entire world is either now locked in a global economic recession or soon will be.&#8221; Actually, that&#8217;s a major clue to what started this thought-contagion about everything being the worst it has been &#8220;since the Great Depression&#8221;: Politics.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Patient zero in this epidemic is the Democratic candidate for president. As it would be for any challenger, it&#8217;s in his interest to portray the incumbent party&#8217;s economic performance in the grimmest possible terms. Barack Obama has frequently used the Depression exaggeration, including during a campaign speech in June, when he said that the &#8220;percentage of homes in foreclosure and late mortgage payments is the highest since the Great Depression.&#8221; At best, this statement is a good guess. To be really true, it would have to be heavily qualified with words such as &#8220;maybe&#8221; or &#8220;probably.&#8221; According to economist David C. Wheelock of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who has studied the history of mortgage markets for the Fed, &#8220;there are no consistent data on foreclosure or delinquency going all the way back to the Depression.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) database, which allows rigorous apples-to-apples comparisons, only goes back to 1979. It shows that today&#8217;s delinquency rate is only a little higher than the level seen in 1985. As to the foreclosure rate, it was setting records for the day &#8212; the highest since the Great Depression, one supposes &#8212; in 1999, at the peak of the Clinton-era prosperity that Obama celebrated in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention late last month. I don&#8217;t recall hearing any Democratic politicians complaining back then.</p>
<p>Even if Obama is right that the foreclosure rate is the worst since the Great Depression, it&#8217;s spurious to evoke memories of that great national calamity when talking about today &#8212; it&#8217;s akin to equating a sore throat with stomach cancer. According to the MBA, 6.4 percent of mortgages are delinquent to some extent, and 2.75 percent are in foreclosure. During the Great Depression, according to Wheelock&#8217;s research, more than 50 percent of home loans were in default.</p>
<p>Moreover, MBA data show that today&#8217;s foreclosures are concentrated in that small fraction of U.S. homes financed by subprime mortgages. Such homes make up only 12 percent of all mortgages, yet account for 52 percent of foreclosures. This suggests that today&#8217;s mortgage difficulties are probably a side effect of the otherwise happy fact that&#8230;.. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>The game goes on… for now</p>
<p>The first round of musical chairs ended earlier this year when Bear Stearns was the one left standing when the music stopped. Poor little BSC ate too much subprime candy, got too fat and slow, and couldn’t make it to a chair fast enough. JP Morgan Chase got to eat what was left of BSC’s candy, and the US taxpayers got to clean up the wrappers.</p>
<p>Apparently the second round ended yesterday, and Lehman was left without a chair. Lehman didn’t eat too much subprime but apparently had quite the sweet tooth for Alt-A. The other kids are going to be forced to clean up the mess that LEH made, but I think it remains to be seen if the US taxpayers will have to do another good scrubbing.</p>
<p>But it seems two other chairs were pulled from the game this time. Lucky Merrill gets to sit on the lap of Bank of America for the time being (though that lap is getting quite crowded with Countrywide and all). And AIG is begging “Big Mama Fed” for one more chance.</p>
<p>Next few days should be very interesting…</p>

                                <p>Let&#8217;s stipulate what &#8220;everybody knows&#8221;:
<ol>
<li>There are some assets in the capital markets, many of which are mortgage-related, that were seriously overvalued over the past several years.</p>
</li>
<li>Many of the others are Credit-related (CDS and CDOs and the like).
<ol>
<li>Most of the two asset types listed above are reasonable concepts that, if they are commoditized, appear more liquid than they are. (Ask any homeseller in the current market.)</li>
<li>Multiple sequences, while they don&#8217;t increase the total systemic risk (algebraically impossible), can have a distorting effect on risk, and</li>
<li>Leveraging assets that are not so liquid can lead to cash flow mismatches in the best of circumstances.</li>
</ol>
<p></li>
<li>Attempting to arbitrage a perceived opportunity between a long-term obligation and a similar short-term obligation depends very much on funding, carry considerations, and liquidity.  (Not certain if everyone knows that one—but everyone who does risk management should.)
</li>
<li>The Fed fears a &#8220;contagion effect&#8221; that will do more damage to the financial system than the &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; that accompanies &#8220;saving&#8221; any given firm.
</li>
<li>The Fed &#8220;saved&#8221; Bear Stearns (a.k.a., The Old Firm, or BS for short), to extent that they guaranteed the second through thirty-first billion dollars in losses that JPMC may (or may not) realise from having bought the firm.
</li>
<li>The Fed &#8220;saved&#8221; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the stupidest way possible, ending their forty years in the desert as semi-private entities.
<ol>
<li>The leaders who drove Fannie and Freddie into the Fed&#8217;s arms were rewarded handsomely for their not-so-creative destruction of their firms, most especially <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/18/AR2008081802111_pf.html">Daniel &#8220;acted-like-Harry&#8221; Mudd</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p></li>
<li>On the surface, a Fed that saved BS should be likely to save LEH. (See <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/roubini-and-bail-in-this-weekend.html">rdan&#8217;s post below</a>, citing Nouriel Roubini discussing the similarities.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The center of Roubini&#8217;s argument seems to be this:<br />
<blockquote>But then if on Monday no deal is done Lehman collapses and goes into Chapter 11 court and you have the beginning of a systemic financial meltdown as the run on the other broker dealers will start. Thus, what Fed and Treasury are trying to do this weekend is another 1998 LTCM bailin or Korea 1997 bailin, i.e. trying to convince all the major institutions to either support a purchase of Lehman or maintain their exposure to Lehman if no buyers is found. </p></blockquote>
<p>The Chapter 11 filing <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/lehman-to-file-for-bankruptcy-protection/">appears to be what is about to happen</a>. The rest is, perhaps, <a href="http://www.fleurdelis.com/desiderata.htm">unfolding as it should</a>.</p>
<p>What Roubini is talking about is, basically, the same thing as the &#8220;contagion effect&#8221;  referenced in bullet (4) above.  If Lehmann gets protection, many of its obligations will be reduced.  So if LEH owes you $100 million, you may only get some fraction of that amount, or nothing, depending on the value of the assets and how secured a creditor you are.  So if that $100 million exposure to LEH is essential to your operations, and you haven&#8217;t been able to take actions to mitigate it in the past six months, you may fail.  Etc., <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/turtles/eleanor_20242050.html">as the Turtles once said</a>.</p>
<p>So, yes, there will probably be some businesses that—despite <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/03/15-years-investment-in-place-lost-in.html">almost six months of warning</a>, since Bear and Lehmann were spoken of in the same breath, and had approximately the same leverage, when BS was purchased—who will suffer, and probably a few will go out of business.</p>
<p>But the effect of LEH going out of business would <em><strong>not</strong></em> be so severe as the effect of BS going out of business for one reason that Roubini, for some reason, appears not to have mentioned.</p>
<p><em>Lehmann has no clearing business.</em></p>
<p>Had Bear gone out of business, about 30% of the hedge funds in the country would not have been able to execute virtually <em>any</em> transaction for the following thirty days.  Not a payment.  Not a redemption.  Not a trade on a listed exchange.  Not a receipt.  Not a de-leveraging.  Not a swap payment, not a CDS payment, not fulfilling an option exercised against them.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not just a &#8220;maybe&#8221; about financial collapse in such a scenario; P probably well in excess of 0.9944.  $30 billion is a &#8220;bargain&#8221; in such a situation.</p>
<p>LEH has been on the ropes for at least six months, probably longer.*  They were given a &#8220;word of confidence&#8221; by Goldman at the same time the Street was conspicuously silent about the prospects for BS.***  Anyone who has been looking at their risk positions without looking at their LEH exposure over the past six months doesn&#8217;t belong in the risk management business.  As <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/10/a-battered-lehman-fights-for-survival/">DealBook noted last Wednesday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Financial institutions have been closely measuring their exposure to Lehman. On Tuesday, commercial and investment banks said they continued to do business with Lehman, and hedge funds did not appear to be pulling their accounts with the firm, events that helped precipitate the fall of Bear Stearns.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a brilliant moment in Janet Tavakoli&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.booksamillion.com/product/9780471412663?id=4214424925428">Credit Derivatives and Synthetic Structures</a></em>:<br />
<blockquote>[B]efore the fall 1997 [Korean banking] crisis, I took a call from a trader at a securities firm&#8230;.The trader told me that several Korean banks were willing to offer credit default protection on other Korean names. In order to bolster up their own credit perception, they were willing to post 30 to 40 percent of the notional amount with G7&#8230;collateral&#8230;.The trader then went on to tell me that Commercial Bank of Korea would sell credit default protection on bonds issued by the Commercial Bank of Korea.<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s very interesting,&#8221; I countered, &#8220;but the credit default option is worthless.&#8221;<br />&#8220;But people are doing it,&#8221; persisted the trader.<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing,&#8221; I affirmed. &#8220;The correlation between Commercial Bank of Korea and itself is 100 percent. I would pay nothing for that credit protection. It is worthless for this purpose.&#8221;<br />The trader mustered his best grammar, chilliest tone, and most authoritative voice: &#8220;There are those who would disagree with you.&#8221; (p. 85)</p></blockquote>
<p>Several months later, those people were, presumably, downsized.  Eleven years after that, no one in the market today would make the mistake of not considering the risk of the guarantor as well as the guaranteed.</p>
<p>LEH will file bankruptcy, but the market has largely priced that into its current market valuations.  There will be failures, and there will be many stories about <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/for-lehman-employees-the-collapse-is-personal/">the suffering of former LEH employees</a>, and the occasional counterparty without another option close at hand.</p>
<p>But its failure would not have a contagion effect, and any Fed support should be not to save the firm itself but, in the manner of the SBA&#8217;s efforts in NYC seven years ago, small loans to ensure that as few of those counterparties whose businesses are impaired by the LEH bankruptcy are unable to find other sources of capital.</p>
<p>As for the other firms—MER, AIG, etc.—those that can be saved are already <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/bank-of-america-in-talks-to-buy-merrill-lynch/">taking</a> <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/aig-to-plan-massive-restructuring/">action</a>, if they still can.</p>
<p>After a necessary saving of BS, and an ill-timed, ill-considered <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/deprivatization/">deprivatization</a> (h/t <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/calling-things.html">Brad DeLong</a>) of Fannie and Freddie, letting LEH declare bankruptcy—assuming it remains necessary through the night—is the best choice.</p>
<p>Even if Alan Greenspan <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aMXXouFNfC4I&#038;refer=home">does agree with it</a>.</p>
<p>*If you look at the debt market, they knew BS was a junk or near-junk credit in August of 2007 (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aFbRONWfpjU8">5-yr notes at 245 over</a>), when the stock was still trading at levels well north of 100.** LEH debt at the time was priced significantly higher (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aFbRONWfpjU8">10-year notes in July 2007 ca. 140 over</a> [same as Bear link]). &#8220;Lehman&#8217;s credit-default swaps [then] carr[ied] an implied rating of Ba1, according to Moody&#8217;s.&#8221;  And no one believes things go better since then.<br />**There is a reason everyone agrees that fixed income is more difficult to price than equity.  Accordingly, FI people dig a lot deeper in their evaluations.

<p>If John McCain wins the November election and becomes president of the<br />United States, it is likely that he will continue to support Supply side<br />policies that have placed the government so precariously in debt. With<br />debt levels already too high, the effects of the Fannie and Freddie<br />bailout, along with declining tax revenue due to a recession, any<br />incumbent president must make difficult choices in 2009.</p>
<p>The only way to return the US government to a fiscally sound position is<br />to either increase taxes or cut spending or have some combination of the<br />two. Because of the sheer size of the possible 2009 deficit, cutting<br />military spending seems to be the only real solution.</p>
<p>If McCain and Palin win the White House in 2009, it is unlikely that<br />they would support either a rise in taxes or a cut in military spending.<br />Any other form of spending cuts are unlikely to reduce the deficit,<br />which means that a McCain presidency is more likely to exacerbate the<br />fiscal situation than solve it.</p>
<p>In 1984 Walter Mondale lost the election because he promised to increase<br />taxes to pay back Reagan&#8217;s deficits. Now his promise is coming back to<br />haunt the Republican party and the memory of Reagan.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2008/09/mccain-money-and-mondale.html<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />Quotes:<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />The problem is that, for the last 25 years, the Republican Party has<br />been dominated more or less by Supply-side economics, a form of &#8220;voodoo<br />economics&#8221; which believes that tax cuts fund themselves by stimulating<br />economic growth and generating more tax revenue. While there is some<br />truth to be found in the more intellectual corners of this economic<br />system, it has resulted in a simplistic and effective myth &#8211;  that the<br />government should just keep cutting taxes.</p>
<p>After 25 or more years, popular supply-side economics has resulted in<br />nothing but large federal government deficits. Ronald Reagan&#8217;s big tax<br />cuts in the 1980s were followed by increased tax revenue but also a<br />corresponding increase in public debt. It was not until George H.W. Bush<br />raised taxes after his &#8220;read my lips&#8221; promise that Supply side economics<br />began to lose its influence. But by that stage, the damage had been done<br />and the US government was deeply in debt.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />So, fiscal irresponsibility + Fannie and Freddie Bailout + recession<br />equals a federal government with a massive debt burden that will most<br />likely exceed any comparative level of net debt in peacetime US history.</p>
<p>Of course, for regular readers, this warning of mine is nothing new. So<br />why am I repeating the fiscal alarm all over again? It is because I<br />believe that a McCain/Palin administration will continue the fiscal<br />irresponsibility started under Bush. Moreover, the inaction of the<br />Democratic-party dominated congress (elected in 2006) has allowed the<br />situation to deteriorate. If the White House continues to be Republican,<br />there is little chance that a Democratic Congress will have the<br />testicular fortitude to stand up to him and pass economically sensible<br />bills.</p>
<p>The only real chance for fiscal responsibility to return to Washington<br />is for a Democratically controlled Congress and White House. Republicans<br />have proven themselves too attached to Supply side economics for the<br />past 25 years (with the notable exception of the Gingrich years) while<br />the Democrats have not.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />Which brings to mind the prophetic words of 1984 Democratic presidential<br />candidate Walter Mondale. When discussing the Reagan tax cuts and the<br />deficits that had resulted from them, Mondale said these fateful words:</p>
<p>&#8220;By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by<br />two-thirds. Let&#8217;s tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr.<br />Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won&#8217;t tell you. I just did.&#8221;<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />It was over ten years ago that The Simpsons episode &#8220;Trash of the<br />Titans&#8221; was aired. In that episode, Homer becomes Springfield&#8217;s<br />sanitation commissioner, defeating the incumbent Ray Patterson (voiced<br />by Steve Martin), and promises a lot of crazy things for the people of<br />Springfield. Homer&#8217;s policies soon end up bankrupting his department and<br />completely ruining the city. When Ray Patterson is unanimously voted<br />back in as sanitation commissioner, he gives this wonderfully short speech:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh gosh. You know, I&#8217;m not much on speeches, but, it&#8217;s so gratifying to<br />leave you wallowing in the mess you&#8217;ve made. You&#8217;re screwed, thank you,<br />bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but think of comparing Walter Mondale to Ray Patterson<br />here. Twenty-four years after his abysmal failure in the 1984<br />presidential election, Mondale could probably be justified in repeating<br />Ray Patterson&#8217;s short speech.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />by One Salient Oversight</p>

<blockquote><p>Nouriel Roubini | Sep 13, 2008 </p>
<p>It is now clear that we are again – as we were in mid- March at the time of the Bear Stearns collapse – an epsilon away from a generalized run on most of the shadow banking system, especially the other major independent broker dealers (Lehman, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs). If Lehman does not find a buyer over the weekend and the counterparties of Lehman withdraw their credit lines on Monday (as they all will in the absence of a deal) you will have not only a collapse of Lehman but also the beginning of a run on the other independent broker dealers (Merrill Lynch first but also in sequence Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and possibly even those broker dealers that are part of a larger commercial bank, I.e. JP Morgan and Citigroup). Then this run would lead to a massive systemic meltdown of the financial system. That is the reason why the Fed has convened in emergency meetings the heads of all major Wall Street firms on Friday and again today to convince them not to pull the plug on Lehman and maintain their exposure to this distressed broker dealer.</p>
<p>Let me elaborate in much detail on these issues…</p>
<p>This bail-in of investors is the opposite of a bailout of investors like the one that was done in the case of Bear Stearns and Fannie and Freddie. It is thus akin to the bail-in of investors that was done in the case of LTCM in the summer of 1998 and the bail-in of the interbank creditors of Korean banks in the winter of 1997. I wrote in 2004 with Brad Setser an entire book titled “Bailouts versus Bailins: Responding to Financial Crises in Emerging Markets” that discusses these policy tradeoffs in financial crises where you have runs on the liquid liabilities of either illiquid and/or insolvent countries. Those were the international equivalent of the banks runs and financial crises that we are now seeing in the cases of Bear Stearns, Lehman and Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p>Since government bailouts put at risk public money and create moral hazard Treasury and the Fed decided that they need to draw a line somewhere after the bailouts of Bear Stearns creditors, of Fannie and Freddie and all the other actions aimed at backstopping the financial system. These actions have included the creation of the TAF, TSLF, PDCF, the use of the FHLBs to provide liquidity to distressed mortgage lenders, the provision of Treasury liquidity to the FHLBs, the outright purchase of agency MBS by the Treasury, the swapping of two thirds of the safe Treasuries of the Fed for toxic illiquid securities of banks and non banks, etc. So after having created the mother of all moral hazard with their actions (including the biggest bailout of all, i.e. the rescue of Fannie and Freddie) the Fed and Treasury are playing a chicken game with the financial system. Tim Geithner told clearly to the heads of all the major Wall Street firms that if they pull the plug on Lehman and Lehman collapses they are next in line for a run on their institutions. So if a buyer for Lehman is not found (or even if it is found and the counterparty lines are still pulled) not only Lehman will collapse but the run will extend to all of the other major broker dealers and banks that are the counterparties of Lehman.</p>
<p>The Fed may delude itself in thinking – as its stress models suggest – that the systemic risk of a collapse of Lehman are less serious than those of Bear Stearns: afterall Lehman is less involved into CDSs than Bear was and now both Lehman and the other major broker dealers have access to the discount window with the PDCF. A collapse of Lehman instead will have as much of a systemic effect as the collapse of Bear for many reasons: Lehman is larger than Bear was; Lehman is a major player in a variety of key financial markets; all the other major Wall Street institutions are interconnected with Lehman in dozens of different types of counterparty activities; the PDCF support of the Fed is neither unlimited nor unconditional, i.e. investors cannot assume that Lehman or any other broker dealer can borrow unlimited amounts with no conditions from the discount window. Thus, a collapse of Lehman would trigger a panic and a potential run on all sort of other broker dealers and also on other distressed financial institutions like banks (WaMu) and insurance companies (AIG) and smaller member of the shadow financial system (distressed and highly leveraged hedge funds, etc.).</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>The reason why Lehman is having a hard time to find a buyer is that it is most likely insolvent. If you had to mark to market the value of it illiquid and toxic assets (the $40 billion of commercial real estate assets, its remaining residential MBS and CDOs, its holdings of real estate private equity funds) Lehman is most likely insolvent (i.e. has negative net worth with liabilities well above its impaired assets). So leaving aside the potential and now dubious value of its franchise (an option to the value of a much slimmed down financial institution) no financial institution should be paying even a single penny to buy an insolvent firm. That is why all the potential suitors of Lehman (such as Bank of America and others) are waiting for the government to provide another sleazy Bear Stearns deal where the government would buy at higher than market value the toxic assets of Lehman (the commercial real estate assets for example) so as to make the net worth of the remaining institution positive and worth buying. But such action – borderline illegal in the case of Bear as pointed out by Paul Volcker – would be a scandal in the case of Lehman and severely exacerbate the moral hazard problem.</p>
<p>But here lies the conundrum of this Lehman crisis: no one seems to want to buy for a positive price Lehman unless there is a public subsidy (taking off their toxic assets off the firms’ balance sheet). The government cannot afford to provide the subsidy as the moral hazard problems are becoming severe. But then if on Monday no deal is done Lehman collapses and goes into Chapter 11 court and you have the beginning of a systemic financial meltdown as the run on the other broker dealers will start. Thus, what Fed and Treasury are trying to do this weekend is another 1998 LTCM bailin or Korea 1997 bailin, i.e. trying to convince all the major institutions to either support a purchase of Lehman or maintain their exposure to Lehman if no buyers is found. Can this bail-in work? It is not clear as there is a major collective action problem: you can’t only convince half a dozen major Wall Street firms to maintain their exposure to Lehman. You need also to convince all the other counterparties of Lehman (including the hedge funds and the other broker dealers and banks) not to roll off their claims and credit to Lehman. This is a much more messy collective action problem and coordination game than in the case of LTCM and Korea where the number of involved counterparties was more limited (less than 20 in each case).</p>
<p>Paulson and Bernanke and Geithner (the troika managing this financial crisis) have all made public statements in the last few month to the necessity of finding an orderly way to close down – rather than bailout – a major and systemically important non bank financial institutions: the embarrassment and losses for the Fed that the bailout of the creditors of Bear led made it paramount to avoid another Bear like bailout. That is why they are now playing tough with Lehman and its creditors. But in this game of chicken the Fed and the Treasury may end up being the ones to blink. Faced with the risk of a generalized run on the other broker dealers they may decide that greasing again a deal for the purchase of Lehman may be less costly and less risky than testing whether the system can orderly work out a collapse of Lehman (something that is highly uncertain). Even in the case of the Bank of America purchase of Countrywide such public subsidy was significant (the FHLB of Atlanta lent to Countrywide over $50 billion and Bank of America has most likely received plenty of tacit forbearance from the Fed to support its takeover of an insolvent Countrywide). So implicitly or explicitly the Fed and the Treasury may decide – however reckless and moral hazard laden that choice may be – to provide some explicit or implicit subsidy to a private purchase of Lehman.</p>
<p>The trouble is that, in spite of all public statements regarding the need to provide an orderly demise of large broker dealers, the Fed and the Treasury have done nothing to create such insolvency regime for such broker dealers. So the only option for Lehman – if a buyer is not found &#8211; will be the one of ending up in Chapter 11 and trigger massive losses on its counterparties that will in turn trigger a run on such counterparties.</p>
<p>In February of 2008 I predicted – in my “12 Steps to a Financial Disaster” – that one or two major broker dealers would go bankrupt. A month later Bear Stearns went bust and the collapse of the other ones was avoided for a time by the most radical change in monetary policy since the Great Depression, i.e. the creation of the PDCF that extended the lender of last resort (LOLR) role of the Fed to non-bank systemically important broker dealers (i.e. all of the bank and non bank primary dealers of the Fed).</p>
<p>I next argued in June that such action would not prevent a run on other broker dealers such Lehman as to avoid a run you need both deposit insurance and unlimited and unconditional access to the Fed LOLR support. I also discussed why Lehman was next in line for a collapse and why the PDCF would not prevent a run on Lehman.</p>
<p>I also argued in follow-up pieces that, in a matter of two years, no one of the remaining independent broker dealers (Lehman, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs) would survive as: 1. their business model is now impaired (securitization is semi-dead); 2. they will need to be regulated like banks given the PDCF support and thus have lower leverage, higher liquidity and more capital that will erode their profitability; 3. Their severe maturity mismatch – borrowing very short term and liquid, leveraging a lot and lending and investing in more long term and illiquid ways – makes them very fragile – in the absence of deposit insurance and in the presence of only limited LOLR support by a central bank – to bank like run that are destructive even of illiquid but otherwise solvent institutions. Thus all such broker dealers need to merge with larger financial institutions that have a commercial banking arm and thus access to stable and insured deposits and to true LOLR Fed support. That process of unraveling of independent broker dealers started with Bear Stearns; now it is moved to Lehman; tomorrow Merrill Lynch will be on line; and Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will be next. No one of them can and will survive as independent entities. So, the Fed and Treasury should advise them all to start finding a large international partner (international as almost no domestic partner is now sound to take them over) and merge with such partner before we get another Bear or Lehman disaster.</p>
<p>The step by step, ad hoc and non-holistic approach of Fed and Treasury to crisis management has been a failure so far as plugging and filling one hole at the time is useless when the entire system of levies is collapsing in the perfect financial storm of the century. A much more radical, holistic and systemic approach to crisis management is now necessary.</p>
<p>What we are facing now if the beginning of the unraveling and collapse of the entire shadow financial system, a system of institutions (broker dealers, hedge funds, private equity funds, SIVs, conduits, etc.) that look like banks (as they borrow short, are highly leveraged and lend and invest long and in illiquid ways) and thus are highly vulnerable to bank like runs; but unlike banks they are not properly regulated and supervised, they don’t have access to deposit insurance and don’t have access to the lender of last resort support of the central bank (with now only a small group of them having access to the limited and conditional and thus fragile support of the Fed). So no wonder that this shadow banking system is now collapsing. The entire conduits/SIV system has already collapsed with the roll-off of their ABCP financing; next is the collapse of the broker dealers (Bear, Lehman and soon enough the other ones) that rely mostly on unstable overnight repos and other very short term funding for their financing; next will be hundreds of poorly managed hedge funds that will face a tsunami of redemptions; and finally runs on money market funds that are not supported by a large financial institutions or other smaller member of the shadow banking system as well as highly leveraged and distressed private equity funds cannot be ruled out either.</p>
<p>This is indeed the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression and occurring at a time when the US is falling in a now severe consumer led recession. The vicious interaction between a systemic financial and banking crisis and a severe economic contraction will get much worse before there is any bottom to it. We are only in the third inning of a nine innings economic and financial crisis. And the only light at the end of the tunnel is the one of the incoming train wreck.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>&#8220;As the market falls aggressively, we find that there are further developments from authorities that act as ST supports for the Dow. But the real concern is that each crisis has been followed by a bigger crisis and this just does not feel like the “capitulation blow out”&#8221;</p>

<p>Also here are some observations from Barry Ritholtz about the Fannie and Freddie nationalization:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Six observations/questions/takeaways from the past of weekend rescues history:</p>
<p>1. A strong rally lasts for a while, but it eventually fades and makes a new lower low;<br />2. Each &#8220;rescue rally&#8221; has been shorter in duration and weaker in intensity than the immediately prior one;<br />3. Friday&#8217;s close becomes your new line in the sand; If and when that is breached, look out below.<br />4. The pre-Asian open news pattern reveals the Asset price focus is a large part of these issues; It also speaks to our overseas creditors/Overlords;<br />5. What form of free markets have we evolved into? It is not Capitalism, it is not Socialism, it is not intelligent regulation. WTF is this?!?<br />6. During the prior 5 interventions, the VIX was at cyclical record highs. This time, the VIX was at a much more modest level (22)</p>

<p>Militarism and Oil</p>
<p>I have been on the web figuring out what is going on with Palin, who has not had much experience with the North Atlantic, and seems to want Georgia and Ukraine to gain membership in NATO.  So I did some googling on Caspian Sea pipelines.  Interesting stuff.   Seems both Russia and Iran have interests in Caspian Sea oil exports.  Seems the larger producers of oil on the sea are Azerbaijan (bordering Georgia) and Kazakhstan on the west coast.  Viewing a map the Caspian Sea has not rivers flowing out and no connection by water to other maritime routes.  Getting oil and gas from the area is by pipeline.</p>
<p>Russia and Iran have significant issue with Kazakh oil and gas crossing the Caspian via submerged pipeline.  So Kazakh product will go east and south, making Afghanistan an interesting place for pipeline development as well as Iran.  So, why NOT make war on Iran?  The carbon swelling products need to get to China, India and Japan.</p>
<p>A more interesting issue is; what about Georgia?  There are several routes for Azerbaijan/Baku oil.  One is to a Russian republic port on the Black Sea, one is to a Georgian port on the Black Sea, and a third planned route is through Georgia and Turkey (1800 km) to a port in Turkey on the Mediterranean Sea.  Using Georgian pipelines denies Russian revenues for pipeline tariffs and maintenance.</p>
<p>For some reason Israel wants the Mediterranean-Georgian pipeline and since Israel receives much of its security funding from the US it has served as a US surrogate providing about a thousand advisors to Georgia preparing them for their escapade into Ossetia on 8 Aug 08.</p>
<p>The Russians responded defending Ossetia with their &#8220;peacekeepers&#8221; and sending the signal that Georgian pipelines are not secure and can be cut.  That does not support US oil to invest in Georgia?</p>
<p>Similarly, pipelines run through Ukraine which delivers Russian petroleum products to west Europe.</p>
<p>Considering pipeline security and the ability of the Russians to control oil and gas flow, NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia means NATO would establish defense of US interests in pipelines and energy supplies for US pipeline companies who sell to Europe.</p>
<p>This is vastly expensive military response to externalities from oil consumption.  Response that is too expensive and counter productive.</p>
<p>More oil cowboy world affairs from Palin and Mc Cain.  When will the US need to commit two aircraft carriers to the Black Sea?<br />_________________</p>
