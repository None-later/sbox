It seems they’ll miss Rick Santorum but hope Robert Menéndez will be a key ally in the new Senate.  So which freshman Senators do Big Pharma fear?<br />
<blockquote>The defeat of Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) &#8220;creates a big hole we will need to fill,&#8221; the e-mail says. Sen.-elect Jon Tester (D-Mont.) &#8220;is expected to be a problem,&#8221; it says, and the elevation to the Senate of Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) &#8220;will strengthen his ability to challenge us.&#8221; </p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Let’s start off with a civil exchange of thoughts from <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2006/11/look-whos-talking-about-social.html">Andrew Samwick</a> and <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/11/no_precondition.html">Mark Thoma</a>.   Andrew writes:<br />
<blockquote>The President used to go around the country making speeches of the form, &#8220;Social Security is in financial trouble. We need voluntary personal accounts.&#8221; The speeches made no sense, as many people (like Mark) rightly pointed out. There is no connection between restoring solvency and voluntary personal accounts … Okay, it&#8217;s a new day, with new leadership in Congress. The Administration cannot now presume to dictate the terms of the debate. The Administration essentially has to win one key point about the goals of the debate: that the standard for reform should be that under current projections, the final product achieve &#8220;sustainable solvency&#8221; for the system: a positive and rising Trust Fund balance at the end of the projection period … The message to Democrats is as follows: go find a plan that achieves sustainable solvency without personal accounts and then we can talk.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fair enough, but <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/11/post_editorializes_against_soc.html#014613">Dean Baker</a> might suggest that the size of the benefits cuts needed for long-run solvency are not that large.  But why on earth do we have the get the usually gentle <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002694.html">Max Sawicky</a> cursing at <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112101520.html">this lady</a>: <br />
<blockquote>It also means that the White House is willing to listen to other ideas, administration officials said, including personal savings accounts that do not involve diverting Social Security taxes, as well higher payroll taxes to help cover a projected explosion in Social Security costs after members of the baby boom generation begin to retire in 2008 … The big three entitlement programs eat up 8 percent of the country&#8217;s total economic output and are projected to double in cost over the next 50 years, creating a budget hole that must be shrunk by cutting benefits or filled by raising taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>When Max wasn’t cursing at Lori Montgomery, he managed to draw a neat graph showing “costs” as a percent of GDP (slowly rising) and “the drain on the non-Social Security budget” also as a percent of GDP, which actually starts off with non-interest surpluses from now until 2018.  But pay close attention to Max’s green line, which he calls the “money legally owed to the program”.  It seems the Social Security Trust Fund continues to grow and best yet – earns interest.  OK – after a while, it starts to decline as the baby boomers take the retirement benefits out that they’ve been putting into the program for decades.  </p>
<p>I trust Lori Montgomery does not like to be cursed at by gentlemen, but until she understands this issue – could she cease and desist from writing such garbage in the Washington Post?  Sorry to include such this turkey amongst some good contributions from Andrew, Dean, Mark, and Max.  Happy a nice Thanksgiving Day.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Lately, there have been a slew of articles about Milton Friedman.  Most of those articles discuss Friedman’s importance in terms of promulgating monetarism, but they don’t actually provide a definition of monetarism.</p>
<p>I’ve heard several definitions of monetarism and monetarists.  Perhaps the broadest is that a monetarist is someone who thinks that changes in the money supply affect the economy.  But by that definition, just about everyone is a monetarist.  Most of us, whether we have an economic education or not, can noodle out that if you increase the money supply by enough, you will have runaway inflation, and if you shrink it by enough, you will have liquidity problems. </p>
<p>A better definition might be that a monetarist is one who believes in the monetarist rule.  The monetarist rule states that the Federal Reserve should increase the money supply by a slow steady rate every year.  This prevents disruptions due to too much or too little money sloshing around, and also prevents people from trying to game the system.  Friedman put the desired rate of increase at about 3% or 5% a year.  (The increase is necessary to accommodate both increasing population and the increasing complexity of the economy.  More people need more money, but each person also engages in more transactions now than, say, 100 years ago.)  </p>
<p>So has the Fed been following these policies?  The table below shows the average percentage rate of growth of M1 and M2 since 1960, by presidency (through 2005):<br />_______________M1_______M2<br />Ike_____________-1.1%____2.9%<br />JFK_____________2.5%____7.8%<br />LBJ_____________4.8%____7.6%<br />Nixon___________6.1%____8.4%<br />Ford____________5.0%____10.7%<br />Carter___________7.0%_____9.0%<br />Reagan__________9.1%_____8.5%<br />GHW___________5.1%_____3.7%<br />Clinton__________1.9%_____4.3%<br />GW_____________4.6%_____6.5%</p>
<p>1960 – 1980______5.0%______8.0%<br />1980-2005_______5.0%______5.7%</p>
<p>(BTW… since I keep messing up when I do this, its worth pointing out I think I got it right this time…  M1 in 1980 was 387.3….  then 387.3*[(1+0.05)^26] = 1377.12.  Actual M1 in 2005 was 1382… the difference is due to rounding… when don’t round off the percentage I get the 2005 figure, spot on.) </p>
<p>Clearly, neither M1 nor M2 is increasing at a slow, steady rate.  But…  perhaps after adjusting for inflation and population growth?</p>
<p>________real M1 per cap_______real M2 per cap<br />Ike_____________-4.7%____-0.9%<br />JFK____________-0.1%_____5.0%<br />LBJ_____________1.0%____3.6%<br />Nixon___________-0.9%____1.3%<br />Ford____________-3.2%____2.1%<br />Carter___________-3.5%___-1.7%<br />Reagan__________3.3%_____2.8%<br />GHW___________-0.4%____-1.8%<br />Clinton__________-1.9%____0.5%<br />GW_____________1.0%_____2.8%</p>
<p>1960 – 1980_____-1.1%______1.8%<br />1980-2005_______0.6%______1.2%</p>
<p>Adjusting for inflation and population growth, it doesn’t seem like M1 or M2 became any slower or more stable as the sample progressed.  The Fed may have done many things, but it doesn’t seem to have pursued anything resembling the monetarist rule.</p>
<p>Is there anything we can learn about the Fed behavior?  I dunno… all I get this from this is that since 1980, the Fed has seemed to be rooting for the practitioners of what GHW once called Voodoo economics, since those boys sure seemed to get the Fed wind at their backs.  Anyone surprised?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.examiner.com/a-411803~Romney___I_m_a_conservative_Republican_.html">Bill Sammon</a> reports on some of the thoughts from Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney opening with a sentiment that I tend to agree with:<br />
<blockquote>Eager to position himself as the most conservative GOP presidential hopeful, Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney accused Sen. John McCain Monday of being “disingenuous” on gay marriage … Romney was less charitable to McCain, who on Sunday told ABC News: “I believe that the issue of gay marriage should be decided by the states.” McCain also said, “I believe that gay marriage should not be legal.” Romney seized on the remarks. “That’s his position, and in my opinion, it’s disingenuous,” he said. “Look, if somebody says they’re in favor of gay marriage, I respect that view. If someone says &#8211; like I do &#8211; that I oppose same–sex marriage, I respect that view. But those who try and pretend to have it both ways, I find it to be disingenuous.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Why does anyone think John McCain deserves to be referred to as the “straight talk express” given that he has been disingenuous about a lot of things?  Whether McCain is a conservative, moderate, or even a liberal is not the point.  We have suffered through incredible dishonesty from the White House for the past six years and will likely see even more for the rest of Bush’s term.  We don’t need another dishonest President so if Romney wants to be honest with the voters – great.  But then we get this:<br />
<blockquote>In an interview with The Examiner, Romney described himself as more conservative than Republican rivals McCain, R-Ariz., and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani on a variety of issues. “We’re in a different place on immigration; we’re in a different place on campaign reform; we’re in a different place on same–sex marriage; we’re in a different place on the president’s policy on interrogation of detainees,” Romney said.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I were a conservative, I would be insulted to be associated with disdain for people from other nations and disdain for gays and lesbians.  But it does seem that a prerequisite for the GOP nomination is to show a sufficient level of hate for one’s fellow man.  Oh well – at least the Grand Old Party still has all those free lunches of spending more as they pretend to “give you your money back” with all those tax cuts.</p>

                                <p>In <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_11/010275.php">back</a> to <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_11/010274.php">back</a> posts, Kevin Drum may be onto something where “liberal” Nancy Pelosi may actually find a way to pay for those tax cuts.  Today’s offering points to a story where Pelosi intends to <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/11/22/MNGJAMHNT61.DTL">get to work immediately</a>.  Yesterday’s offering noted how the Hastert led Congress <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061121/ap_on_go_co/cluttered_congress">dropped the ball</a> in terms of passing various spending bills:<br />
<blockquote>Republicans vacating the Capitol are dumping a big spring cleaning job on Democrats moving in. GOP leaders have opted to leave behind almost a half-trillion-dollar clutter of unfinished spending bills. There&#8217;s also no guarantee that Republicans will pass a multibillion-dollar measure to prevent a cut in fees to doctors treating Medicare patients. The bulging workload that a Republican-led Congress was supposed to complete this year but is instead punting to 2007 promises to consume time and energy that Democrats had hoped to devote to their own agenda upon taking control of Congress in January for the first time in a dozen years. The decision to drop so much unfinished work in Democrats&#8217; laps demonstrates both division within Republicans ranks and the difficulty in resolving so many knotty questions in so short a time. GOP leaders promised their House and Senate members the December lame duck session would last no more than two weeks, or until Dec. 16 at the latest.  Now, with the agenda shrinking, a session that will be the last for 45 retiring or defeated House members and senators should be wrapped up by Dec. 8. That could work against efforts to forestall a cut in physicians&#8217; Medicare payments. Under a formula dating back to 1997, Medicare payments to doctors for office visits will drop an average 5 percent on Jan. 1 &#8211; unless Congress steps in. Keeping them the same for another year would be expensive, about $10.8 billion, and chances are mixed at best for the doctors&#8217; lobby. Driving the decision to quit and go home rather than finish the remaining budget work is a determined effort by a group of conservative Republicans to prevent putting a GOP stamp on spending bills covering 13 Cabinet Departments — and loaded with thousands of homestate projects derided as &#8220;pork&#8221; by critics. Some Republicans on Capitol Hill would rather complete this year&#8217;s budget work and have the GOP&#8217;s imprint rather than a Democratic one on how federal agencies will be spending their money through next September. However, conservatives such as Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., fear doing that would leave as the GOP&#8217;s legacy a foot-tall bill containing thousands of parochial projects. Last week they seized the upper hand by employing delaying tactics to drag the budget process to a halt in the Senate. &#8220;The last thing Republicans need is an end-of-Congress spending spree as our last parting shot as we walk out the door,&#8221; said DeMint spokesman Wesley Denton.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a way, I’m glad Hastert&#038;Co. abdicated responsibility.  The sooner this corrupt bunch of hypocrites leave town – the better.  I’m just hoping Pelosi decides to pull together the true fiscal conservatives like Jeff Flake and the Blue Dog Democrats and deletes a lot of the pork this past Congress has so gleefully increased.  While President Bush loves to talk about tax cuts as if he’s giving us our money back – we have not seen a shred of fiscal leadership from the White House in six years and should not expect any for the next two years.  So Nancy – it’s up to you.</p>

<blockquote>NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) &#8211; The U.S. economy should experience slower growth than originally anticipated for the remainder of the year and in 2007, the White House said Tuesday. The President&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisers projected that economic growth would be slower than forecasted last June, with real gross domestic product growing 3.1 percent for all of 2006, down from June projections of 3.6 percent pace. In 2007, the White House expects the economy to expand at a pace of 2.9 percent, lower than earlier predictions of 3.3 percent. &#8220;The economic forecast clearly reflects the fact that the U.S. economy is moderating to more sustainable growth levels, firmer labor markets and steady inflation rates,&#8221; Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in accompanying remarks.</p></blockquote>
<p>More sustainable growth and firmer labor markets?  Now, that is putting a happy face on a rather sour forecast.  Over the past six years, average real GDP growth has been a mere 2.5% per year and yet we heard the Bush cheerleaders crying this is the greatest economy ever.  Whenever some private forecaster suggest that weakening housing demand would lead to slower economic growth – the same cheerleaders attacked.  </p>
<p>Now I HOPE the economy exceeds expectations, but can we once and for all put a rest to the free lunch nonsense from the supply-siders that tax cuts are the magic cure all for long-term growth?  Then again – Dick Cheney was uttering the “R-word” back in December of 2000 to make the case for the first Bush tax cut.  I’m sensing a repeat performance.</p>

<p><a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2006/11/drafting-with-charlie-rangel.html">Andrew Samwick</a> continues the debate over Charles Rangel’s proposal to bring back the draft:  <br />
<blockquote>To my mind, the largest problem with the draft is that it puts a lot of untrained people not just in a position to get themselves killed but in areas where they might compromise the safety and mission of the well trained armed forces who would still do most of the work … The fundamental issue is not a draft but a mass mobilization of the population. In the wake of 9/11, much of the population was willing to be mobilized. Manpower applied to homeland security and the &#8220;War on Terror&#8221; could have been increased substantially without conscription. We would be five years ahead of where we are now in terms of training the citizenry to resist or respond to attack and to match them to the areas where they could help the most. During these five years, there as been a frustrating absence of Presidential rhetoric about how citizens can participate meaningfully. If militant Islam is now such a threat to our existence as a society, then why are we not encouraged to change our way of life as a society to meet it? Is our patriotic duty as a citizenry really just to keep the economy humming along, so that tax revenues are generated to pay for the military budget? There&#8217;s little outlet for patriotism in going to the office or the mall. To channel the patriotic fervor into something constructive, we need people to engage in something new, not something routine.</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrew was motivated by a comment made to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/draft-charles-rangel-milton-friedman.html">my earlier post</a> from <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/116399060125375959/#568097">k harris</a>. I took the liberty of firing off one of my frustrations with how neither George W. Bush nor LBJ had the courage to raise taxes to finance their war efforts.  From a macroeconomic stabilization perspective, had we had fiscal restraint during these two periods, it would have relieved the pressure on the Federal Reserve as to using monetary restraint to avoid inflation.  </p>
<p>Robert Barro might view this issue differently as he did in his <a href="http://econ161.berkeley.edu/teaching_Folder/Econ_202b_F2000/papers/Barro,_Determination_Debt.pdf">On the Determination of the Public Debt</a>. Barro assumes the Ricardian Equivalence proposition asking what is the optimal timing of tax collections?  His model assumes the long-run budget constraint that the present value of taxes should equal the present value of expected future government spending plus any accumulated debt.  His primary hypotheses are: (1) temporary increases in government spending (e.g., from a war) would be financed mainly from debt creation and not tax increases; and (2) the temporary losses of tax revenues from recessions would not be offset by tax rate increases.  While the title of Barro’s paper included the term “public debt”, we have graphed both the public debt to GDP ratio and the larger total Federal debt to GDP ratio (after all, much of the accumulated total Federal debt is supposed to be financing the future retirement benefits of the baby boomers).  </p>
<p>The spike in the debt to GDP ratio during World War II is consistent with Barro’s hypothesis as is the modest increases in the debt to GDP ratio from past recessions.  During the Korean and Vietnam Wars, however, the debt to GDP ratio continued to fall.  One might reason that these wars were not as dramatic as World War II.  Note also that we did not see shifts toward fiscal restraint during either one of those wars.  </p>
<p>There were two periods since World War II where the debt to GDP ratio rose.  One was the period following the 1981 tax cut.  While the Reagan worshipers might argue they were fighting the Cold War, the increase in defense spending was relatively minor.  Besides – if government spending even temporarily rises – shouldn’t we see at least a tiny increase in the tax burden on the current generation so future generations don’t have to face a much larger burden?  </p>
<p>The other period is the current one.  Without question, the fiscal fiasco of George W. Burden is shifting the tax burden away from us elders onto the kids.  Yet, it is the kids who are fighting the George W. Bush wars that will pay the taxes so we don&#8217;t have to.  After all, telling the voters that this war would be costly would have cost Karl Rove&#8217;s clients some votes in 2004.  Perhaps some increase in the debt to GDP ratio should have been expected as a result of the 2001 recession and the 2003 invasion of Iraq (as idiotic as that decision on March 19, 2003 happened to be).  But the current Administration seems hell bent on making sure as much of the tax burden is shifted to the future as possible.  So even if the kids returning from Iraq are lucky enough to have a productive future in the U.S. economy, they have been saddled with a guarantee that their tax burden will rise as a result of the failed fiscal policies of their Commander-in-Chief.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/11/rolling_back_th.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes a challenge to the small government conservatives issued by <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-op-chait19nov19,0,1777895.column?coll=la-news-comment-opinions">Jonathan Chait</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Republicans, on the other hand, pretty much never change. They&#8217;re like a Terminator machine (and unlike the governor who played the Terminator and who has dramatically recast his ideology). Crush them in a machine press, or freeze them and blow them into tiny pieces, and they&#8217;ll just regroup and keep lurching forward, cutting taxes for the rich and jacking up defense spending. Ever wonder why that is? It&#8217;s because conservatives have an apparatus in place to interpret every election. If Republicans win, it&#8217;s because they were conservative. If they lose, it&#8217;s because they weren&#8217;t. No matter what the facts may be, they will always conclude that the answer is to run further to the right.  But exactly how have Republicans overspent? The largest spending increases under Bush, by far, have come in defense and homeland security, which conservatives support. The next biggest item is the Medicare bill. Horribly designed though it was, you can&#8217;t say it was unpopular. Poll results indicate that about 90% of the public support adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare. McCain blamed the GOP loss on &#8220;the massive programs such as Medicare prescription drug program … our failure to address their priorities as opposed to our own, and there was obviously a reaction to it.&#8221; But the Medicare bill was the public&#8217;s priority. If Republicans really want to recommit to smaller government, they can run on a simple platform of rolling back the Bush spending hikes. Go ahead, Republicans, I dare you: Promise to slash the Pentagon, eliminate homeland security and take away everybody&#8217;s Medicare drug coverage. Of course, they won&#8217;t really do that. What they&#8217;ll do is promise unspecified spending cuts that they&#8217;ll never carry out, along with lots of specified tax cuts that they will carry out. Conservatives are in a perpetual vice, squeezed between their vision for the country and the voters&#8217; vision for the country. They&#8217;ll never reduce government to the size they&#8217;d like, but they&#8217;re too fanatical to admit that they can&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Chait thinks few conservatives will have the courage to take his challenge, we can only hope someone on the right will rise to the occasion.  So does <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTUzYzQzOWFmOTQ3MzZmZjYwY2E1MTdkNGZlODZmMDg=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> rise to the challenge:<br />
<blockquote>The single-best thing the lame-duck GOP Congress can do is vote in a spending-limitation bill with balanced-budget targets for the next couple of years. This would be a spending-cap pay-as-you-go, which means that any increased spending must be offset by lower spending in other parts of the budget. Not higher taxes. Reduced spending. This policy action would send a clear message to disaffected Republicans and independents (think Ross Perot voters) that the GOP is moving to regain the high ground on limited government and budgetary restraint. The era of big-government conservatism must come to an end. And right now. In the new Congress next year, Democrats will push a revenue paygo. This means any new spending initiatives could be financed through higher taxes. And Democrats want to spend. Just take a look at their wish list: student loan subsidies, a major expansion of No Child Left Behind, more money to fill so-called “doughnut hole” (Medicare Part D) prescription-drug assistance, and an expansion of health care for the uninsured on the way to universal health coverage. We could be talking hundreds of billions of dollars of budget increases that under a revenue paygo system would require higher tax rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Kudlow babbles on – he does not provide a single example of where he would cut spending.  Now – all he does is to repeat his nonsense about revenue paygo v. spending paygo.  Maybe he’s not aware of how large the current fiscal gap is but to suggest it is the Democrats who want more spending is a lie.  The Democrats would to cut the special interest goodies passed out by the Hastert led Congress of corruption.  They would also find the funds to fill that Medicare Part D doughnut hole by allowing for Medicare to negotiate with Big Pharma – hopefully providing more benefits to patients with less long-run cost to the Treasury.  </p>
<p>You know for all the time Kudlow spends dishonestly bashing Democrats – you’d think he’d find just one place where he’d advocate specific cuts to government spending.  Kudlow once again makes a clown out of himself – and seems to confirm Chait’s cynicism.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>When the new Congress is sworn in, GW will have had 6 years in which he’s controlled the Presidency, his allies and supporters control the Congress, conservatives control the Supreme Court, and the head of the Fed has been a friendly.  In other words, he’s had six years in which he’s had more opportunity to shape the world than any President in recent memory – certainly a lot more than, say, Reagan, GHW, or Clinton.  Which means that more any other recent President, GW owns his record.  He, and his supporters, should get the credit for what has been accomplished, and the blame for the failures.</p>
<p>And yet… what has he accomplished?  Well, he’s cut taxes.  He’s invaded two countries.  But are these strictly accomplishments, or are they merely actions?  An accomplishment is something that turned out well, not just something that you happened to do.  </p>
<p>Consider the tax cuts… they were going to spur the economy, leading to increased tax receipts and a booming economy (not to mention paying off the debt).  But even cherry picking starting dates, economic growth hasn’t been all that impressive, and even nominal tax receipts actually fell for a few years.  As to paying off the debt… well, now the goal seems to be cut the deficit GW himself created in half.</p>
<p>What about the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq?  Well, in terms of decisiveness, they’re nothing special.  I remember Reagan, GHW, and Clinton each having their own military actions.  While there were failures (Beirut, Somalia), the signature pieces under Reagan, GHW, and Clinton (I would imagine these are Grenada, Panama, Gulf War 1, and Kosovo) all led to outcomes that a few years on appeared more successful than those in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>All of which is to say… GW was given a free hand to do what he pleased, and at least to me, it seems he failed.</p>
<p>Which raises a few questions:</p>
<p>1.  Am I wrong about this?  Has he succeeded with the tax cuts and with the wars and I (and many others) just don’t see it?<br />2.  Has he succeeded at something else?  He must have done something well – what?  Its coming up on six years… what are his actual accomplishments?<br />3.  If he truly has failed at all the big things, can he not see it himself?  And if he can, if he is truly patriotic, wouldn’t he step aside and let someone with less of a proven record of incompetence take over?<br />4.  Of course, GW hasn’t done it all alone.  There have been plenty of cheerleaders and supporters.  Should questions 1 – 3 apply to them?</p>
<p>I’m sure there are other questions I’m also missing.  Any thoughts?</p>

                                <p>Charles Rangel appeared on Face the Nation just three days after the unfortunate passing of Milton Friedman and advocated the reinstatement of the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/19/rangel.draft.ap/index.html">military draft</a>: <br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8211; Americans would have to sign up for a new military draft after turning 18 if the incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee has his way.  New York Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel said Sunday he sees his idea as a way to deter politicians from launching wars. He believes a draft would bolster U.S. troop levels that are currently insufficient to cover potential future action in Iran, North Korea and Iraq. &#8220;There&#8217;s no question in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress, if indeed we had a draft, and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm&#8217;s way,&#8221; Rangel said. Rangel, a veteran of the Korean War who has unsuccessfully sponsored legislation on conscription in the past, said he will propose a measure early next year. In 2003, he proposed a draft covering people age 18 to 26. This year, he offered a plan to mandate military service for men and women between age 18 and 42. It went nowhere in the Republican-led Congress. Democrats will control the House and Senate come January because of their victories in the November 7 mid-term election. At a time when some lawmakers are urging the military to send more troops to Iraq, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how anyone can support the war and not support the draft,&#8221; said Rangel. He also proposed a draft in January 2003, before the U.S. invasion of Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>We could only wish that Milton Friedman could have renewed his infamous debate with General William Westmoreland as recalled by <a href="http://www.davidrhenderson.com/articles/0199_thankyou.html">David Henderson</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Of course, Meckling wasn&#8217;t the only hero. Milton Friedman was very persuasive. One of Meckling&#8217;s favorite stories, which his widow, Becky, recalled in a recent interview, was of an exchange between Mr. Friedman and General William Westmoreland, then commander of all U.S. troops in Vietnam. In his testimony before the commission, Mr. Westmoreland said he did not want to command an army of mercenaries. Mr. Friedman interrupted, &#8220;General, would you rather command an army of slaves?&#8221; Mr. Westmoreland replied, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to hear our patriotic draftees referred to as slaves.&#8221; Mr. Friedman then retorted, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to hear our patriotic volunteers referred to as mercenaries. If they are mercenaries, then I, sir, am a mercenary professor, and you, sir, are a mercenary general; we are served by mercenary physicians, we use a mercenary lawyer, and we get our meat from a mercenary butcher.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Look – I have tremendous represent for Charles Rangel as I understand his point.  I guess Rangel might have coolly fired back that we pay our soldiers, but this is why I linked to David Henderson’s tribute to William Meckling:<br />
<blockquote>Bill Meckling didn&#8217;t think that was right, and not just because the Vietnam War was so reckless. He had been drafted into the army in World War II and witnessed the government&#8217;s incredibly wasteful use of manpower when it could pay below-market wages. He tucked that lesson away and would use it 25 years later. Meckling went on to become an economist. In 1962 he was named the first dean of the University of Rochester&#8217;s new business school, where he continued until 1983. Meanwhile, a 31-year-old economist named Martin Anderson joined Richard Nixon&#8217;s campaign for president in 1967. One of Mr. Anderson&#8217;s main goals was to persuade Nixon to end the draft, and he wrote the antidraft campaign speech that Nixon gave in 1968. Mr. Anderson then worked, as one of the new president&#8217;s advisers, to end the draft. He helped put together the President&#8217;s Commission on an All-Volunteer Force, whose 15 members included 2 former generals; 3 economists (Milton Friedman, Alan Greenspan, and W. Allen Wallis); 2 civil rights leaders; 1 student; and some businessmen and university presidents. It was chaired by Thomas Gates, who had been secretary of defense under President Eisenhower. When the commission was created, in 1969, the members were not unanimous on ending the draft. In his recent coauthored book, Two Lucky People, Mr. Friedman writes that 5 of the 15 commissioners &#8211; including himself, Mr. Greenspan, and Mr. Wallis &#8211; were against the draft to begin with. Five members were undecided, and 5 were prodraft. Yet when the commission&#8217;s report came out less than a year later and became a paperback book, all 15 members favored ending the draft. What happened in between? That&#8217;s where Bill Meckling comes in.</p></blockquote>
<p>Henderson continues with how the minority on the committee persuaded the rest of the committee to support its advocacy of ending the draft.  Should we reinstate the draft given the apparent need to encourage more soldiers to join the military?  I’m not sure which side I agree with but I do fear that budget cutting politicians would be all too tempted to use the draft to pay below market wages – even as I doubt that is not the intent of Charles Rangel.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2006/11/milton_friedman.html">Richard Posner</a> poses a possible rebuttal to Dr. Friedman:<br />
<blockquote>The smaller the armed forces and the less risk of death or serious injury in military service, the more efficient a volunteer army is relative to a conscript one. These conditions are not satisfied in a general war in which a significant fraction of the young adult population is needed for the proper conduct of the war and the risk of death or serious injury is substantial &#8211; the situation in World War II. For then the government&#8217;s heavy demand for military labor, coupled with the high cost of military service to soldiers at significant risk, would drive the market wage rate for such service through the roof. Very heavy taxes would be required to defray the expense of a volunteer army in these circumstances and those taxes would have misallocative effects that might well exceed the misallocative effects of conscription.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/11/richard_posner_.html">Brad DeLong</a> counters:<br />
<blockquote>Let me channel Uncle Milton on one point: replacing a volunteer army with conscription does not get around the &#8220;very heavy taxes&#8221; with their enormous &#8220;misallocative effects&#8221; needed to man a wartime army. It simply loads those taxes onto a small group: young adult men (and these days women). It leaves the rest of us scot-free. But it is a redistribution away from the draftees &#8211; not an improvement in efficiency.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m listening to CNN discuss this issue in terms of the enormous cost of returning to a draft.  It’s good to hear costs being discussed in terms beyond those that appear in the DoD budget.</p>
