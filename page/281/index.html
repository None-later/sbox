                                                                    </div>

<p>I am generally reluctant to make predictions.  However, I am willing to predict that the cost of TARP will be less than forecast by the CBO.  I should point out that forecasts of the cost have declined.</p>
<p>The reason is that the CBO values TARP assets at &#8220;fair market value&#8221; which means the value for which they could be sold.  It assumes that risky assets are not systematically worth much more to the Treasury than to private investors.  Thus the cost is the cost if the Treasury liquidiated its portfolio (without considering the huge market pressure and reputational effects).  It is not equal to the expected value of additional debt due to TARP &#8212; it is assumed that variance in returns on assets (which by definition doesn&#8217;t affect the expected value of those returns) increases the cost to the Treasury.</p>
<p>I think this is backwards.  It is good for the country for the Treasury to bear risk, so the risky returns act as automatic stabilizers.  </p>
<p>After the jump, I quote <a href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=1422">Doug Elmendorf explaining </a>what they do (and indirectly noting that Barney Frank objected).   Barney Frank is an excellent congressman.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>In its August 2010 baseline projections, CBO included an estimated $53 billion in costs for new mortgage guarantees that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will make over the 2011–2020 period. That estimate was made using a so-called “fair-value” basis of accounting, which differs from the way most federal credit programs are reflected in the budget. In a letter sent today to Congressman Barney Frank, CBO discusses that estimate and compares it with the budgetary impact that would be estimated using the procedures specified in the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA), which governs the accounting for most federal direct loans and loan guarantees. CBO estimates that on a FCRA basis, Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s new mortgage guarantees made over the 2011–2020 period would generate total budgetary savings of $44 billion.</p>
<p>[skip]</p>
<p>FCRA estimates are based on Treasury rates (which are generally viewed as risk-free), whereas fair-value estimates employ discount rates that are adjusted to match the risk of the specific credit obligation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is the appropriate adjusment for risk a higher required return not a lower required return ? Elmendorf doesn&#8217;t say.  He does make it clear that TARP costs are calculated in a way no other costs are calculated (just think what the expected cost of invading Iraq would have been if it were assumed that financial risk must be rewarded).  Notice the little correction of $ 97 billion dollars.  That is (part of) the difference between the reported expected &#8220;cost&#8221; of bailing out the GSEs and the expected effect of that bailout on national debt in 2020 (assuming they aren&#8217;t reprivatized in which case the national debt will be higher in expected value).</p>
<p>I think that answer is that using standard FCRA accounting for Treasury purchases of risky assets would imply that the Treasury should buy risky assets even when there isn&#8217;t a crisis and we just can&#8217;t have that.  That would be socialism.  The standard accounting would still be conservative given the desirability of automatic stabilizers (deficits in downturns and surpluses in expansions).  If the numbers weren&#8217;t calculated with non standard rules, socialism would look sensible, and that just can&#8217;t possibly be allowed.</p>

<p>Worthwhile Canadian point.  <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2010/09/poor-sales-minus-quality-of-labour.html">Nick Rowe </a>looks at Catherine Rampell&#8217;s graph, which everyone has been talking about, and notes the dog that didn&#8217;t bark.  Very few small businessmen are complaining about the quality of labor.  This basically proves that the argument that the incerase in unemployment is due to missmatch is wrong.  If the problem were too many construction workers and no workers in other fields, than firms in other sectors would be complaining about trouble finding qualified workers.</p>
<p>I add that they might also complain about the cost of labor.  These are really the same problem if the minimum wage and contracts negotiated with unions aren&#8217;t binding.  Firms can always hire quality labor if they offer one million and hour.</p>
<p>Fortunately the graph has the fraction describing quality of labor and cost of labor as the number one problem one on top of the other and both shaded blue.  The graph shows the fraction of small business men with the blues declining sharply. </p>
<p><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/?action=view&#038;current=blues.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/blues.jpg" border="0" alt="blues"></a></p>
<p>I am kicking myself for not blogging about this before (I noticed the fact in the graph really I did).  I try to make up for lost time after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Worthwhile US initiative.</p>
<p>And get a load of those yellow employers terrified by insurance companies.  There was a sudden sharp drop in the fraction listing insurance as teh worse problem just about November 2008.  Now part of this (as with the blues) is low sales driving other problems out of first place.  Still the decline is very very dramatic.  There is no similar decline in complaints about taxes (is there ever ?).  </p>
<p>I think that small businessmen were naively optimistic about health care reform&#8217;s chances in congress and counted on HCR eliminating their problem buying insurance for newly hired workers so soon that it was worth hiring and paying through the nose for a year &#8212; oops in the event 6 years, but, hey, too late now employers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the graph shows fairly strong evidence that HCR caused increased hiring by small firms.  Now it might have reduced hiring by large firms (which feared a mandate which turned out to be fairly feeble).  </p>
<p>For both the issue of the blues and the yellow, I&#8217;d like to see a graph of the fraction of small businesses naming something an important problem not just the most important problem.  That way the numbers would not have to add up to 100% and one could really tell to what extent concerns about insurance, the quality of labor and the cost of labor declined and to what extent they were driven out of first place by collapsing sales.</p>

                                <p>The point of the <strong>first</strong> chart, I believe, is that as our navel power decreases Chinese navel power increases.  But that aspect needs to be described carefully as the chart does not explain the differences in navies between the two countries.</p>

<p>The point of the <strong>second</strong> chart is to demonstrate the conundrum of manpower expenses and the rising costs of technology that outstrip resources&#8230;ie getting fewer units for a lot more cost.</p>
<p><strong>Augustine&#8217;s law</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>third</strong> and last piece is to discuss a response to the unexplained comments regarding the equations:</p>
<blockquote><p>That you are not speaking German = FDR, U.S. military forces, and the U.S. defense industry.   </p>
<p>That you are not speaking Japanese = FDR, U.S. military forces, and the U.S. defense industry</p></blockquote>
<p>The fourth aspect is the losing strategy of our lack of cohesive trade policy in  some form of national self-interest, which I believe is at odds with the current views of free trade enthusiasts for little federal intervention and reliance on the good graces of multi-national companies and equilibrium theory of some economists.  But that is for another post.</p>

<blockquote><p>The chronic problem of exorbitantly expensive weapons is becoming acute.</p>
<p>Robert Gates, America&#8217;s defence secretary, has ordered that production of the F-22 should end this year, capping the fleet at 187—a final cull for the Raptor, whose numbers were once supposed to reach about 750. In Europe orders for the Typhoon—a fighter made by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain—will fall. And on both sides of the Atlantic the rising cost of the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter means its order book could shrink sharply.</p>
<p>Mr Gates wants the Pentagon to save 1-2% a year in overheads. A study of defence bureaucracies by McKinsey, a global management consultancy, suggests that American forces, though the most potent in the world, are among the least efficient, at least in terms of the &#8220;tooth-to-tail&#8221; ratio, the proportion of fighting forces to support personnel (the best were Norway, Kuwait and the Netherlands). American forces deploy and fight globally, so need more support than those only defending national borders. Nevertheless, the study suggests there is flab to be trimmed.</p>
<p>Manpower in all-volunteer armies, as most Western ones are these days, is expensive. Pay has to be competitive. In America, moreover, a big burden is the cost of health-care programmes for current and former servicemen, and their families. &#8220;Health-care costs are eating the defence department alive,&#8221; complains Mr Gates. Yet he has a hard time restraining Congress&#8217;s generosity to soldiers and veterans.</p>
<p>One response to high manpower costs is to rely on technology. But that does not come cheap. Study after study shows that the price of combat aircraft has been rising substantially faster than inflation, often faster than GDP. The same is true of warships. In a book published in 1983, Norman Augustine, a luminary of the aerospace industry, drafted a series of lighthearted &#8220;laws&#8221;. In one aphorism, he plotted the exponential growth of unit cost for fighter aircraft since 1910, and extrapolated it to its absurd conclusion:</p>
<p>Nearly three decades on, Mr Augustine says, &#8220;we are right on target. Unfortunately nothing has changed.&#8221; These days Raptors go for $160m apiece ($350m including the cost of developing the jet), compared with $50m-60m for the venerable F-16. In the long run, high unit costs must limit numbers. Since 1970 America&#8217;s fleets of combat aircraft and major warships have shrunk, even as defence spending rose.</p>
<p>Repeated reforms have failed to break this dire cycle. According to the last full report by America&#8217;s Government Accountability Office (GAO), the cost of 96 of America&#8217;s biggest weapons programmes in 2008 had risen on average by 25%, incurring an average delay of 22 months.</p></blockquote>

<p>With President Obama’s announced July 2011 drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan in mind, the Pentagon has already:</p>
<p>a. Begun organizing an orderly early 2011 withdrawal of troops from combat outposts and forward operating bases to larger facilities to facilitate the president’s plan. </p>
<p>b. Launched a new U.S. base-building binge in Afghanistan, including contracts for three $100 million facilities not to be completed, no less completely occupied, until late 2011. </p>
<p>c. Announced plans to shut down Kandahar Air Base’s covered boardwalk, including a TGI Friday’s, a Kentucky Fried Chicken, and a Mamma Mia’s Pizzeria, and cancelled the opening of a Nathan’s Famous Hot Dogs as part of its preparations for an American drawdown.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Answer is b.</p>
<p>According to Walter Pincus of the Washington Post, construction is slated to begin on at least <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/22/AR2010082201670_pf.html">three $100 million air base projects</a> &#8212; “a $100 million area at Shindand Air Base for Special Operations helicopters and unmanned intelligence and surveillance aircraft”; another $100 million to expand the airfield at Camp Dwyer, a Marine base in Helmand Province, also to support Special Operations forces; and a final $100 million for expanded air facilities at Mazar-e Sharif in northern Afghanistan.  None of these projects are to be completed until well after July 2011. “[R]equests for $1.3 billion in additional fiscal 2011 funds for multiyear construction of military facilities in Afghanistan are pending before Congress.”   And fear not, there are no indications that the fast-food joints at Kandahar are going anywhere.</p>

<p>Matthew Yglesias has a post on poverty which is, shall we say, very different from my post on severe poverty below.  In particular <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/09/the-shifting-demographics-of-poverty/#comments">he wrote </a></p>
<blockquote><p>We then had a giant reduction in poverty among this group [female-headed households without husbands] in the 1990s which was a combination of strong economic performance, “welfare reform,” and also the fact that the Clinton administration really wanted to make welfare reform work so threw lots of stuff—EITC expansion, SCHIP, etc.—at making it work. Then we saw a slow, steady erosion of that progress. </p></blockquote>
<p>I totally absolutely utterly disagree as I explain after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say how strongly I disagree with you about welfare reform.  </p>
<p>I note that welfare is still reformed. I think it is possible to distinguish the effects of welfare reform and the booming late 90s by looking at the 00s when we had the reformed welfare system (and SCHIP and expanded EITC).  It seems to me that in 2000 one might wonder if the improvement were due to the tight labor market, to welfare reform or to a combination (as you very confidently assert).  By 2007, it was obvious that the improvement was due to the tight labor market with (just eyeballing the graph) zero help from welfare reform.  Also note the improvement in poverty under Clinton but before Welfare reform.  </p>
<p>More importantly, the poverty rate is a very poor measure of total suffering due to poverty.  to use the poverty rate as a welfare measure you must assum that someone just slightly below the poverty line suffers just as much as someone below half the poverty line.  Obviously you don&#8217;t think anything that silly.  Instead, you must be assuming that similar patterns are found in counts of sever poverty (below half the poverty line) near poverty (poverty line to 1.5 poverty line) etc.  I think you are assuming this.</p>
<p>This assumption is totally utterly false.  No one who wishes to consider poverty in the USA can stop after looking at the poverty rate and the poverty rate by demographic group as you did.  The time series of the severe poverty rate is completely different from the time series of the poverty rate.  It has increased enormously since 1975 (the trough of a recession).  You can&#8217;t possible see the direct benefits of welfare looking the poverty rate as AFDC and TANF benefits were and are below the poverty line.  </p>
<p>If you look at the poverty rate only, you would conclude that no harm was done if people on AFDC instead had zero income and starved after the reform (actually if they really starved the poverty rate would go down).  Of course that didn&#8217;t happen, but the fraction of the population in severe poverty is now the highest in the Census time series (which only goes back to 75).  Oh just go look at my post http://tinyurl.com/267hec4 .</p>
<p>An aside, you make a plainly false claim. You assert that the EITC expansion was part of the Clinton administration&#8217;s effort to make sure that welfare reform worked.  This assertion is utter is nonsense.  The EITC expansion was enacted into law in 1993 long before welfare reform.  </p>
<p>You should have just mentioned SCHIP.  Even in that case, you act as if Clinton was making policy which was actually made by the Republican controlled congress.  Also, just to mind read, I would guess SCHIP was trying to win at least some health care reform and wasn&#8217;t even related to welfare reform in Clinton&#8217;s mind (not that that matters).</p>

                                <p><strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> posts on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/09/17/fighting-protect-consumers">The White House Blog</a> on her new job:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past several weeks, the President and I have had extensive conversations about the vital importance of consumer financial protection.</p>
<p>The President asked me, and I enthusiastically agreed, to serve as an Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  He has also asked me to take on the job to get the new CFPB started—right now.  The President and I are committed to the same vision on CFPB, and I am confident that I will have the tools I need to get the job done.</p>
<p>President Obama understands the importance of leveling the playing field again for families and creating protections that work not just for the wealthy or connected, but for every American. The new consumer bureau is based on a pretty simple idea:  people ought to be able to read their credit card and mortgage contracts and know the deal.  They shouldn’t learn about an unfair rule or practice only when it bites them—way too late for them to do anything about it.  The new law creates a chance to put a tough cop on the beat and provide real accountability and oversight of the consumer credit market.  The time for hiding tricks and traps in the fine print is over.  This new bureau is based on the simple idea that if the playing field is level and families can see what’s going on, they will have better tools to make better choices.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>If the CFPB can succeed at leveling the playing field,  we can go a long way toward repairing a gaping hole in the budgets of millions of families.  But nobody has ever thought or argued that the consumer bureau can fix everything.  Lost jobs, stagnant incomes, rising costs for college, dwindling retirement savings—there’s a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p>When she was 16, my grandmother, Hannie Reed, drove a wagon in the Oklahoma land rush.  Her mother had died, so she was up front with her little brothers and sisters bouncing around in the back.  When I was growing up, she talked about life on the prairie, about marrying my grandfather and making a living building one-room schoolhouses, about getting wiped out in the Great Depression.  She was hit with hard challenges throughout her life, but the moral of her stories was always the same:  she would solve her problems one at a time by pulling up her socks and getting to work.</p>
<p>It’s time for all of us to pull up our socks and get to work.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>NEW YORK — FedEx says its fiscal first-quarter earnings doubled and the company will cut 1,700 jobs as it consolidates its trucking operations to save money.</p>
<p>The company is also boosting its quarterly per share outlook to between $1.15 and $1.35, from $1.05 to $1.25.</p>
<p>The Memphis, Tenn., company earned $380 million, or $1.20 per share, compared with $181 million, or 58 cents per share a year ago.</p>
<p>Revenue rose 18 percent to $9.46 billion.</p>
<p>FedEx will combine its FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations on Jan. 30, closing 100 facilities and cutting 1,700 workers. FedEx Corp. says the move, along with other cost cuts, will ensure it&#8217;s profitable next year.</p></blockquote>
