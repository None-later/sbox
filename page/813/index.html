<p>But they also talk about state and local control as being a good thing – the idea is that the more decisions that get made closer to home and farther from Washington, the better those decisions will be.  So this post looks at the share of federal dollars that are provided as grants to state and local governments – in other words, money in the hands of the federal budget that it decides to turn over to state and local control.  Now, this is not something Democrats claim to care about, so one would assume Republicans will score very high at this, and Democrats will score very poorly.</p>
<p>Below are two graphs… the first shows grants to state and local as a percent of total federal outlays and the second shows grants to state and local as a percent of total GDP.  (Data comes from the White House’s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist12z1.xls">Office of Management of Budget Table 12.1</a>.)</p>

<p>Now, maybe its me and all, but I’m just not seeing Ronald the Reagan as being the patron saint of state and local control here.  Ike, yup.  Nixon/Ford… uh huh.  Even Bush the elder seems to fit the mold of how most Republicans see themselves.  But Reagan is the Washington establishment President.  Perhaps its military spending, but then, one can spend on the military through the National Guard.  I note that GW is safely ensconced in Democrat territory (pity its not also true of economic growth rates!), which makes him most similar to Reagan among Republicans in this regard.   Also, if the last few years are any indication, GW’s emulation of Reagan is only increasing.</p>
<p>Next…  I’m still looking for data on welfare… hopefully that’s the next post in the series.</p>

                                <p>I was going to do this post as another Rudy is babbling segment with Rudy’s latest being something about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/01/us/politics/01giuliani.html?ex=1343620800&#038;en=b1cf8ab80a36338e&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">socialist health care</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rudolph W. Giuliani on Tuesday called for transforming the way health care coverage is provided in the United States, advocating a voluntary move from the current employer-based system to one that would grant substantial tax benefits to people who buy their own insurance.  In his speech here, he excoriated Democrats for advocating a “socialist” solution to solving the problem of the nation’s 44.8 million uninsured, saying the party’s candidates encouraged a “nanny government” by proposing a greater government role in health care &#8230; Mr. Giuliani cited horror stories and selective statistics about health care in foreign countries that provide universal coverage. Mr. Giuliani said that a “socialist” model would bankrupt the government.  “That is where Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards are taking you,” he said. “You have got to see the trap. Otherwise we are in for a disaster. We are in for Canadian health care, French health care, British health care.” But Mr. Giuliani’s speech offered very little in the way of specifics. He said his goal was to outline his “vision,” with more details to come in the fall.</p></blockquote>
<p>A bunch of rightwing buzzwords (e.g. socialist and nanny government) but no specifics on his proposal to fix our currently very inefficient health care system.  But boy did he hit a home run with the crack about Canada, France, and the UK.  Oh wait, <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=08&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=senator_edwards_presents_plans#017457">Dean Baker</a> is calling this strike three on Mr. Giuliani:</p>
<blockquote><p>It would have been helpful to readers to point out that by a wide variety of outcome measures, including life expectancy and infant mortality rates, these countries&#8217; health care systems do as well or better than the United States. Mr. Giuliani is either ignorant of the performance of these health care systems or trying to mislead his audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>I call this strike three as we have seen the same kind of stupidity and/or mendacity from Mr. Giuliani on foreign policy and on fiscal policy.  One has to wonder if his policy wonk is <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/should-national-review-nitwits-be.html">Jonah Goldberg</a>.  But speaking of National Review nitwits, let’s check out what <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MWZlODc2NzFhODZlODg0OWE1Yjg3ODI3NWUzYTc4YzE=">Senator Coburn and Regina Herzlinger</a> wrote for them with respect to the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP):</p>
<blockquote><p>The SCHIP battle is not about whether to insure poor children. The debate is about how to insure them: Via the government or private insurers? This debate has not only pitted Democrats against Republicans but has also sundered the Republican coalition. Some Democrats wanted SCHIP expanded by $50 billion dollars so that even families earning about $81,000 a year who have eligible children were included. (The 2005 U.S. median household income was $46,000.) A resolution with the Republicans who hold minority leadership roles led to a compromise, costing only $35 billion, which allowed coverage for those earning up to $60,000.  A fundamental problem with this compromise is that the same amount of coverage for children within SCHIP costs $1,000 more per child than under private insurance &#8230; Senators Richard Burr (R., N.C.), Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) and others want to refigure the tax code so that we could buy health insurance with tax-sheltered money, a right currently reserved solely for our employers. If we purchased our own health insurance with tax-protected funds, we could keep these arrogant behemoths in check, just as we do in the other sectors of the American economy. The Swiss universal-coverage, consumer-driven system requires people, not employers or governments, to buy health insurance. (The poor primarily receive funds to purchase insurance just like everybody else.) This consumer control enables the Swiss to enjoy an excellent quality of care without the social inequality of single-payer countries at costs that are a third lower than ours.  SCHIP is not merely a debate about yet another mystifying government program. It is all about free-market principles versus government mandates. Giving taxpayers the freedom to choose and buy their own health care would unleash powerful market forces that have been subdued by third-party bureaucracies for the last 60 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately for us, the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/80xx/doc8092/05-10-SCHIP.pdf">Congressional Budget Office</a> analyzed this issue a couple of months ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>States have considerable flexibility in designing their eligibility requirements and policies for SCHIP.  In 2006, 26 states set their eligibility thresholds at 200 percent of the federal poverty level, 15 states had thresholds above 200 percent of the poverty level, and 9 had thresholds below.2 (The federal poverty level for a family of three in 2007 is $17,170.) The lowest eligibility threshold in a state was 140 percent of the poverty level and the highest was 350 percent &#8230; Although SCHIP has significantly reduced the number of uninsured children in low-income families, the net effect on the extent of coverage is smaller than the number of children who have been enrolled in public coverage as a result of SCHIP because the increase in public coverage has been partially offset by a reduction in private coverage.</p></blockquote>
<p>200 percent of the poverty level is less than $35,000 not this $81,000 figure used by Senator Coburn.  And it appears that families have the choice as to whether to sign up for SCHIP coverage or not.  Senator Coburn wants us to believe that the government is forcing insurance on people who would prefer to use their rent and food money to purchase private insurance.  But that is not how I read how CBO is describing the program at all.  Now you might think that the GOP proposal to spend $35 billion (per year) is a lot of assistance, but there is something omitted from what Senator Coburn wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>If annual funding for the program continued at $5 billion (the level incorporated in CBO’s baseline spending projections) and current eligibility rules and benefits were unchanged, by 2017, 43 states would have projected spending outstrip available funds by $8.9 billion. With that level of funding, enrollment would fall from 7.4 million in 2007 to 3.5 million in 2017, CBO estimates … CBO estimates, the net additional federal cost to maintain current programs under SCHIP would be $8 billion over the 2007–2012 period and $28 billion over the 2007–2017 period, relative to baseline spending levels. With those additional funds, enrollment (at any time during the year) would grow from the 8.1 million people in 2007 to 8.8 million in 2012 and 9.4 million in 2017</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put, Coburn is talking spending over the decade – not per annum spending.  You know – making the time frame clear is easy to do as well as being critical if you wish to inform your reading.  Then again – this was a National Review piece, which means it was designed to mislead people.  Let’s be clear – the GOP proposal would either reduce real spending per person or make several working poor families with children not longer eligible for SCHIP assistance.  If that is the intention of the GOP – could they at least be honest enough to say so?</p>

                                <p>The biggest threat to American healthcare may be the nursing shortage, specifically Registered Nurses (RN).</p>
<p>The nursing shortage is unique, I cannot find anyone in the US who disagrees about the nature and extent of the problem.</p>
<p>The shortage is also interesting because despite the agreement on the problem, very little was has been done.</p>
<p>The feds passed a nurse reinvestment act a few years ago (Hillary and Dubya had a love fest) but the total funds were like spitting the in the ocean.</p>
<p>There are many small state and local initiatives, but nothing seems to working.</p>
<p>Besides working with hundreds of nurses, I am married to the world’s greatest nurse, who is now retired at age 55. This is a part of the problem,  the physical beating has taken a toll and her days of pounding the floor are probably over.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Forty years ago women who wanted to work had limited choices; teachers, nurses, secretaries. This guaranteed a steady supply of young nurses, to take the place of those who quit or retired.  How the world has changed.</p>
<p>Now women have all sorts of choices, and men only represent about 4% of nurses (despite numerous outreach programs for a couple of decades).</p>
<p>The average age of nurses is very high, which is a problem. Very few nurses “work the floor” until age 65, which compounds the problem. About 32% of nurses were under the age of 40 in 2004, and only about 60% of licensed RNs  at any given time are working full time.</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>Many Americans need better jobs, so why the shortage?</p>
<p>Nursing requires a skill set many people can not master, and an emotional maturity many people do not have.</p>
<p>The hours are lousy, work includes holidays and weekends, injury rates are high, patients and families can be psycho, physicians can be temperamental and abusive, the pay is ok but not spectacular compared with other professions, and nurses suffer physical and emotional wear-and-tear.</p>
<p>Strategies: Number 1 – create replacements positions</p>
<p>We have LPNs, Medical Assistants, surgical technicians, casting technicians, imaging technicians, cardio technicians, and etc., but we still have a shortage of RNs, because RNs have unique skill sets and everyone else fills other necessary positions.</p>
<p>Strategies: Number 2 – steal nurses from overseas</p>
<p>American hospitals make an organized effort to import nurses. The Philippines actually trains nurses as an export commodity.  Sometimes we steal nurses from Europe and South Africa, and then those country steal nurses from poorer countries. We pass around the shortage.</p>
<p>And the US still has a shortage, and it is getting worse.</p>

<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/too-uninformed-.html">Mark Thoma</a> reads my hometown newpaper – the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-goldberg31jul31,0,5010759.column?coll=la-opinion-rightrail">Los Angeles Times</a> &#8211; so we don’t have to.  Now, I hated to say this as I like the Los Angeles Times, but we are talking about Jonah Goldberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, the point isn&#8217;t to say that the American people are stupid, which is the typical knee-jerk reaction of self- absorbed political junkies. Rather, it&#8217;s that millions of Americans just don&#8217;t care about politics, much the same way that I don&#8217;t care about cricket … Instead of making it easier to vote, maybe we should be making it harder. Why not test people about the basic functions of government?</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark calls this GOP elitism and fires back:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we are going to go this route, why not test for knowledge of the issues too, not just the functions of government?</p></blockquote>
<p>I have only a couple of questions.  One question is why didn’t Mark provide more examples of Jonah Goldberg’s serial stupidity?  OK, so many examples, so little time.  Besides, Mark wanted to point out some stupid statements from other Republicans.  But there is a difference between making an occasional stupid statement versus being a general know-nothing.  But we should give Mark credit for finding a <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=YTVkNGExOTUzZTQ0ZDc1NjAwMmM4MTE2N2QzODllYWM=">real doosie</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economics makes my brain itch. When I was a young policy wonk and had to spend my days deflating constant dollars and reading the Federal budget, I would often give myself paper cuts all over my face just to remind me I was alive. When I was writing for The Street.com I would often wake up in the morning re-enacting the Martin Sheen freak-out scene from Apocalypse Now. Still, I am so baffled by the debate over the surplus that I feel I must wade into those unfriendly waters. For over a year Al Gore has been saying, in one form or another, that Governor Bush endorses a &#8220;huge risky tax scheme that would completely blow the surplus.&#8221; If you search Nexis, you will find dozens of such examples. According to Gore, the Republicans want to &#8220;squander,&#8221; &#8220;give away,&#8221; and &#8220;waste&#8221; the extra dollars in the U.S. Treasury. The media usually let the assumption &#8211; i.e., that having a surplus is inherently a good thing, and not having one is inherently bad &#8211; just fly over the plate. Of course, I have no desire to actually dissect the real numbers being put out there by either side.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s interrupt this August 23, 2000 NRO rant to simply make the point writing three paragraphs saying one does not care about the topic of the op-ed is really bad writing.  But Goldberg does this a lot.  In most of his rants, you have no clue what his point is until you are almost done with the op-ed assuming he even has a point.  So let me try to provide a summary of what he was trying to say in his own words:</p>
<p>The government is not a business &#8230; the surplus is not a &#8220;profit&#8221; &#8230; The government didn&#8217;t earn the surplus (it didn&#8217;t even earn its normal revenues) and is not entitled to blow it on shiny new toys. It&#8217;s your money &#8230; Clinton once said. And he&#8217;s right, alas. But invariably what the government is &#8220;investing&#8221; in are programs that will perpetuate the need for more and higher taxes. They claim to be investing in &#8220;our&#8221; future, when they really mean they are investing in the government&#8217;s future. That&#8217;s why, by the way, they constantly suggest that if you don&#8217;t have a surplus you will have a deficit. This is real &#8220;do not pass go&#8221; thinking. The budget isn&#8217;t a light switch with only two settings. There&#8217;s also this thing called a balanced budget, but that&#8217;s a different story. When Gore and Clinton talk about tax cuts they say cuts will &#8220;cost&#8221; too much. Cost whom? Not you or me; we make money from tax cuts. It wouldn&#8217;t even cost the government anything in terms of things it&#8217;s doing right now, because a surplus is, by definition, extra money. No, the only cost is to government-types, people who want to spend it on new things.</p>
<p>No wonder his brain itches.  Goldberg did not have a clue that governments have a long-run budget constraint.  In fact, he didn’t have a clue about a lot of things back then.  To assist the incredibly ignorant pundit (BTW – he claims to have been a policy wonk at one point in his life, which is really scary), we’ve draw a graph of both the total Federal debt (TFD) relative to GDP and debt held by the public (DHP) relative to GDP.  Before the Kemp-Roth tax “cut”, TFD relative to GDP had managed to fall to 32.6 percent.  But the Reagan era was not one of limited government.  Rather, it was a period of tax deferral with TFD relative to GDP rising to 67.3 percent.  </p>
<p>The reason that President Clinton had the 1993 tax increase passed was not that he wanted a bigger government.  The reason, which anyone remotely familiar with fiscal policy issues knew, was that we wanted to reverse the explosion of the Federal debt relative to GDP.  </p>
<p>Most of us realized in 2000 that the unified surplus was really a Trust Fund surplus, that is, accumulating things like Social Security Trust Fund reserves.  Al Gore talked about this a lot in 2000.  Something about a “lock box”.  How could Mr. Goldberg have missed this?  </p>
<p>Finally, George W. Bush was not talking about a smaller government back in 2000.  He was talking about spending “your money” even as he promised to give it back.  For those really listening to George W. Bush, he was promising to put us back on the fiscal train wreck that we saw during the 1980’s.  And judging from our graph, he delivered on that promise – big time.</p>
<p>But Jonah Goldberg was too stupid to understand this.  Judging from what he’s written over the past seven years, he is still just as stupid.  Which brings me to my main question, which is directed to my hometown newspaper?  Why on earth do you give this idiot an op-ed column?  I guess one could argue that the <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/opinion/24brooks.html&#038;OQ=_rQ3D1Q26hp&#038;OP=202a54b5Q2F)Q5Dwu)FQ3DeQ7BQ7BF)Q25xx6)x6)Q25,)Q7B84p4Q7Bp)Q25,ueQ7BQ7BoQ3DAfF2G">New York Times</a> allows <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/on-the-editoria.html">David Brooks</a> to write nonsense for them.  But as a resident of Los Angeles, is it too much to ask that we not see ourselves as being no better than New York.  Simply because the New York Times makes the mistake of allowing David Brooks to babble on its editorial pages, why on earth would the Los Angeles Times allow a village idiot like Jonah Goldberg to spoil its editorial pages?</p>

                                <p>This post looks at farm subsidies over time.  At least I think it does.  I’m using line 351 of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist03z2.xls">Office of Management of Budget Table 3.2</a>, “Farm income stabilization.”  (I’ve tried finding data on the USDA site – it seems to be designed specifically not to provide data on farm subsidies.  I’ve also e-mailed folks from the USDA with no response – I note that to my recollection, this is the first time I’ve ever e-mailed a government agency and not gotten a response in a week.)  </p>
<p>Here’s a graph of farm income stabilization payments as a percentage of the budget, and another with farm income stabilization payments as a percent of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z2.xls">GDP</a>.</p>

<p>(It occurs to me I probably should have left in an additional place after the decimal point on these graphs&#8230;  running too low on time to correct it right now.  Sorry.)</p>
<p>So what do we get out of this?  Well, this particular series is not as, um, trendy (to misapply a word) as other series I’ve looked at so far.  At this point, I should state straight up – I never paid much attention to agricultural issues, so my conjecture is likely to be flawed.  (Hopefully readers will chime in and correct me.)  My guess is that some of the spikes in the graph are related to various incarnations of the Freedom to Farm or similar acts.  The 1996 Freedom to Farm Act seems to be followed (a year later) by an increase in Farm Income payments as a percent of the budget, and two years later by Farm Income payments as a percent of GDP.  I don’t know enough to comment about events during the Reagan admin, though I do recall there was something of a farm crisis and the large payments to farmers were probably related to that.</p>
<p>Note… Republicans (much to my surprise) are not as big into farm subsidies as Dems.  If one runs a means test where the null hypothesis is that the Reps and Dems have the same policies on farm subsidies, that null hypothesis is rejected (P-value of less than .07 for both series).  </p>
<p>The only other thing I can say about farm subsidies comes courtesy of Reader Dan, who sent me a link to this <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07818.pdf">GAO report</a> showing that not only do a lot of farmers get subsidies, but a lot of them continue to (improperly) receive them long after they’re dead. </p>
<p>Anyway, given that I can’t really add anything, I can only hope you got something from the graphs.</p>

                                <p>This post is by reader Noni Mausa&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Myths and legends are not mere entertainment &#8212; instead, they can be viewed as concentrated and abstracted wisdom, offering us insight on human nature and our problems.</p>
<p>Case in point: In the legendary days of pre-Christian Britain, one of the early kings was called Bran the Blessed, who held court together with his brothers and their beautiful sister Branwen.</p>
<p>The legend tells that two of these siblings were twins &#8212; Nysien and Efnysien. Nysien was a kindly lad, whose very presence brought harmony to any room he might enter, even if the worst of enemies were there. And his brother Efnysien was just the opposite &#8212; he would raise discord between the firmest of friends or between bride and groom.</p>
<p>Efnysien was a proud and savage man, and his overweening pride led him to a series of atrocities when the King of Ireland came to visit. Because of Efnysien, a war arose between the British and the Irish, leading in the end to disaster for both nations &#8212; the poisoning of the Irish land and to the death of all but seven of the British warriors.</p>
<p>Of course this is just a legend (one clue is the Bran the Blessed was so large that when his nation went to war he could gather the anchor ropes of his whole fleet and cross the channel dragging them behind). But legends are useful for telling us things we already know. The spirit of Efnysien is still around, powerful in its ability to drag international discourse downwards into atrocity, savagery and hatred.</p>
<p>The Efnysien Effect is currently finding its expression through what is being called international terrorism. So, the question facing responsible international players is, how to deal with the Efnysien Effect and avoiding their atrocities to reduce all participants to the same level of barbarism?</p>
<p>Atrocity unilaterally redefines the context within which the social parties will act. As such, atrocity (if you lack moral barriers to doing it) is one of the most powerful tactics, if you want to prevent concord, rational and genial interaction, and abstract planning and thought. Efnysien was completely free of scruples, to the detriment of Ireland and his own country.</p>
<p>However, Efnysien needed more than lack of scruples in order to have the effect that he did. In addition, he had a social position which dictated he be treated with respect. As a prince of the royal family, he could not be imprisoned, exiled, or otherwise punished. Instead, his kindly and farseeing elder brother the King offered apologies over and over again to the Irish, seeking civility and dealing generously.</p>
<p>What came of it according to legend was not reconciliation but disaster. the King acted with civility, and that did not work. Then the king and his nation went to war, and that did not work either &#8212; all because of his inability to deal with his royal brother.</p>
<p>Our modern Efnysiens have both these necessary qualities &#8212; a willingness to commit atrocity, and some sort of protection or legitimacy. Their ability to drag international relationships willy-nilly into war seems to be built into our nature as social animals. Their legitimacy, whether family, religion, nation or other, prevents us from addressing the atrocity&#8211; it destroys or neuters our nature as rational and spiritual animals.</p>
<p>Knowing this, the real question we face when dealing with terrorism is; how do we prevent the Efnysiens of the world from setting the agenda unilaterally?</p>

                                <p>What on earth is <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070730/ap_on_el_pr/giuliani_democrats">Rudy</a> babbling about now:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani on Monday accused Democrats of favoring a controlling &#8220;nanny government&#8221; as he continued his bashing of the rival party.  The former New York mayor, opening a two-day campaign trip in the first primary state, also claimed that Democrats would raise taxes between 20 percent to 30 percent. He offered no specifics to back up those figures.</p></blockquote>
<p>No specifics to back up his claims is about right.  I get really tired of the spend and spend and borrow and borrow free lunch freaks in the GOP bashing us Democrats over taxes since all these massive deficits that their tax shifts in disguise of tax “cuts: amount to deferred taxation.  But that’s not what ticks me off with respect to the latest babbling from Rudy.  This is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It looks like they&#8217;re going to raise taxes anywhere between 20 to 30 percent. John Edwards just said he&#8217;s going to raise the capital gains tax double that. Last time we did that, we lost 40 percent in revenue. The last time we did what John Edwards is discussing, the United States lost revenue by basically discouraging people from making investments.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Two problems here.  John Edwards is not proposing a 60 percent tax on capital gains (double of 30 percent).  The bigger problem is that Rudy has no evidence that treating capital gains like any other form of capital income with respect to taxation discourages investment.  </p>
<p>I know Rudy wants to sound like a rightwing in the tradition of Donald Luskin or Rush Limbaugh.  On that score – he is succeeding wonderfully as this babbling is either really stupid or really dishonest, if not both.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2007/07/26/analyst_counters_bush_on_al_qaeda/?page=full">The Boston Globe reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A day after President Bush sought to present evidence showing that Iraq is now the main battlefront against Al Qaeda, the chief US intelligence analyst for international terrorism told Congress that the network&#8217;s growing ranks in Pakistan and Afghanistan pose a more immediate threat to the United States.</p>
<p>In rare testimony before two House committees, Edward Gistaro, the national intelligence officer for transnational threats, said that Al Qaeda terrorists operating in South Asia are better equipped to attack the United States than the network&#8217;s followers in Iraq are.<br />Asked which arm of Al Qaeda concerned him the most, Gistaro told a joint session of the House armed services and intelligence panels that it was South Asia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The primary concern is in Al Qaeda in South Asia organizing its own plots against the United States,&#8221; he said. Al Qaeda planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks from its bases in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The top leaders of the terrorist network, Gistaro added, are &#8220;able to exploit the comfort zone in the tribal areas&#8221; of Pakistan and Afghanistan and are &#8220;bringing people in to train for Western operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We see increased efforts on the part of Al Qaeda to try and find, train, and deploy people who could get into this country,&#8221; he testified.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a top US general in Afghanistan told Pentagon reporters in a video teleconference that the number of Al Qaeda foot soldiers traveling to South Asia has increased up to 60 percent over the past year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s increased probably 50 to 60 percent over what it was last year . . . and they come from multiple areas in the Middle East,&#8221; said Army Major General David Rodriguez, commander of the 82d Airborne Division.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is the purpose of the President&#8217;s rhetoric?  </p>

                                <p>Questions about establishing rates for Medicare Service can be approached in at least two ways according to <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/22/6/68">this article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>These payment differences raise important questions about how Medicare should pay for the same procedure offered in different settings. Should payment rates vary based on cost differences between sites of care, or should they be uniform across settings? One option is to allow the rate to vary between sites of care and to base the setting-specific rate on the costs incurred by efficient providers in that setting. This is similar to Medicare’s current payment approach.11 A second option is to pay the same amount for the same service regardless of the setting, adjusting for the mix of patients. A uniform rate could be based on the cost of providing the service in the most efficient setting. Whichever option is chosen, it is important to understand how the health status of patients treated in each setting differs. <br />Basing payment on underlying costs. Under the first payment approach, payment variations by setting should reflect underlying cost differences among settings, such as differences in the mix of patients or providers’ cost structure. However, there is the potential for payment variations to instead be related to the separate development of each reimbursement system. Payment variations that are unrelated to differences in underlying costs could mean that the service is more profitable in one setting than another. Varying profitability could create financial incentives to shift services between settings, which might increase costs to Medicare and its beneficiaries.12 </p>
<p>Because of the potential for differences in profitability, it is important to investigate whether payment variations reflect cost differences between the settings. Such an analysis would ideally be based on recent data on the costs incurred by efficient providers in each setting. In many cases, however, recent cost data are incomplete or unavailable. In the ASC setting, for instance, the most recent data on facility costs are from a survey conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS, then known as HCFA) in 1994. Thus, indirect measures of costliness also should be considered. Factors that affect the cost of providing care include regulatory requirements, productivity, infrastructure and medical equipment, staffing levels, types of procedures provided, and patients’ health status. It is presumably more costly to provide care to patients with more health problems. For example, surgical patients with comorbidities could require additional time in the operating and recovery rooms and more sophisticated monitoring during the surgery. </p>
<p>Basing payment on the most efficient setting. Even if payment reflects cost in each setting, one setting might be able to provide a given set of services more efficiently—at lower cost with equal or better outcomes. If so, Medicare might wish to pay a uniform rate across settings based on the costs of the most efficient setting. This policy would provide a financial incentive for services to shift to the most desirable setting while encouraging providers in other settings to become more efficient.13 If this approach were to be pursued, policymakers would need better data on the costs of care, treatment outcomes, and patients’ health status to determine the most efficient setting. Because patients’ prior health status affects both costs and outcomes, it is important to control for this variable when comparing costs and outcomes between settings.</p></blockquote>
