<p>Corporations Don&#8217;t Need More Tax Breaks</p>
<p>If you listen to the corporate lobbyists, and the right-wingers who plead their cases for them in Congress and in the media, you&#8217;d think that corporations are so heavily taxed that it is threatening their ability to continue to conduct business and be competitive in world markets. But is that really the case? This blog has often pointed out two obvious shortcomings in the corporate whine: first, the corporate statutory rate of 35% is honored in the breach&#8211;most corporations pay actual tax rates so significantly lower than 35% that the statutory rate is an illusion; and second, as far as global competitiveness is concerned, the corporate tax rate is the only significant tax that US corporations pay, whereas most other countries have both corporate income taxes and VAT taxes, often paid at each transactional stage of production.</p>
<p>A site called &#8220;NerdWallet&#8221; provides considerable information based on analysis of the financial statements of companies, providing greater transparency for investors and, lucky for us, for those of us interested in tax facts.   See, e.g., the NerdWallet study, <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/markets/2012/corporate-taxes-only-9-percent/">Top Companies Paid 9% Tax Rate </a>(July 24, 2012).<br />
<blockquote>Because tax provision includes both domestic and foreign, current and deferred taxes, NerdWallet researched further to find how much was actually paid by these American companies to the U.S. federal government in the most recent tax year.  By dividing the current portion of federal taxes by pre-tax income, NerdWallet was able to calculate the percentage of these companies’ earnings that was paid to the U.S. government. <strong>For the ten American companies with highest earnings in the most recent fiscal year, this number averaged 9%. NerdWallet Study (emphasis added).</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>A press release about the study notes just how much corporate taxation has shrunk as a source of revenue in the US, as corporations pay lower rates than ordinary Americans.<br />
<blockquote>A new <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/markets/2012/corporate-taxes-only-9-percent/">NerdWallet study</a> found the 10 most profitable U.S. companies paid an average of just 9% in federal taxes last year. These low rates are particularly shocking given that the official tax rate is 35%. The study also revealed that more than half of the 500 largest U.S. companies <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/markets/2012/individual-vs-corporate-taxes/">paid a lower tax rate</a> than the average American.  NerdWallet press release (July 30 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>NerdWallet also has a very useful tool for seeing what each major corporation of the top 500 actually pays in taxes, available <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/markets/corporate-taxes/general-electric-co">here</a>. You can scroll through a list of corporations to select a particular one of interest, and the tool will show the actual rate of taxes paid to the U.S. government, the compensation paid to the CEO, and the average compensation for the company&#8217;s employees, as well as the multiple of the CEO compensation to the average employee compensation. For example, the tool provides the following information for several of the largest of the 500 corporations.<br />
<blockquote>1. Exxon Mobil Pre-tax Earnings: $73.3 Billion Actual Taxes Paid: $1.5 Billion (2%)<br />2. Chevron Pre-tax Earnings: $46.6 Billion Actual Taxes Paid: $1.9 Billion (4%)<br />3. Apple Pre-tax Earnings: $34.2 Billion Actual Taxes Paid $3.9 Billion (11%)<br />4. Microsoft Pre-tax Earnings: $28.1 Billion Actual Taxes Paid: $3.1 Billion (11%)<br />5. JPMorgan Chase &#038; Co Pre-tax Earnings: $26.7 Billion Actual Taxes Paid $3.7 Billion (14%)</p></blockquote>

                                <p>
<div>Romney released a new middle class economic plan [today].  [The] plan is called: “Mitt Romney’s new plan for a stronger middle class.” It contains ideas we’ve heard before: more access to domestic energy resources; cutting taxes and capping spending; repealing Obamacare.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Mark Hopkins at Moody’s Analytics tells me that it is mostly a set of assertions about <i>outcomes</i> Romney wants, rather than a set of policies on how to achieve them.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“There aren’t enough specifics here to evaluate the plan,” Hopkins said. “It’s not clear in most cases what specific policies underlie the assertions of outcomes he wants.”
</p>
</div>
<div>&#8212; Greg Sargent, Washington Post, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/the-obama-campaigns-real-game-plan/2012/08/02/gJQA2vC8RX_blog.html?hpid=z2">today</a>
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Indeed.  Hopefully Obama and more members of the media will point out the distinction between a stated <i>plan</i> and a mere statement of claimed outcomes of an unspecified plan.  Romney and his wife say that the public has all the information it “needs” about his finances in order to take his word for it that his finances have all been on the up-and-up, and he makes essentially the same claim about his planned economic policies: All the public needs to know is, Romney says so.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>Which in a way is true—if you get my point.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the Middle Class, Stupid! (Review)</p>
<p>When I saw that James Carville and Stan Greenberg had just published <i>It&#8217;s the Middle Class, Stupid!</i> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Middle-Class-Stupid-James-Carville/dp/0399160396">Blue Rider Press</a>), I knew that I would want to read it. I had always liked Carville&#8217;s <i>We&#8217;re Right, They&#8217;re Wrong</i> and wanted to know his take on approaching the declining fortunes of the middle class.<br />    <br />While this book includes some diagnosis of the problems and has a very detailed and very good set of policy proposals, primarily it is a work on political strategy. Based on polling and focus groups the authors have conducted over the last several years (as well as their long experience running campaigns and polling), Carville and Greenberg analyze what they consider some of the political failures of the Obama Administration, particularly with regards to messaging.<br />     <br />For example, they argue that Americans are not persuaded by Team Obama&#8217;s continuing emphasis on the fact that the President inherited a mess from the Bush Administration (Chapter 11). Although voters place much of the blame for the Great Recession on President Bush, Greenberg reports that his focus groups reacted very negatively to President Obama&#8217;s car-in-the-ditch metaphor (&#8220;I&#8217;m still in the ditch!&#8221; many told Greenberg) and the participants expressed strong opinions that we needed to look forward, not backward.    </p>
<p>As one said, &#8220;[Obama] is trying to say things are turning around, but the numbers are still bad.&#8221; The premature declaration of victory by the Administration described here has been strongly criticized by <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/was-failure-inevitable/">Paul Krugman</a>, among others. Economically effective policy is the best talking point. Carville and Greenberg also give a compelling litany of sophisticated responses to even &#8220;good&#8221; job creation news on pp. 103-7.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The second big, non-obvious, point is that Americans really are concerned about the deficit and debt (Chapter 8). Again, even though they recognize the role of the Bush tax cuts and unfunded wars in creating that debt, they are still leery about the possibility of spending our way to more economic growth, though not by huge majorities. Too many of them are convinced of the false analogy between households and governments, although Paul Krugman is doing his best to convince them with his new book, <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/978-0-393-08877-9/"><i>End This Depression Now!</i></a> The framing the authors found most persuasive to middle class voters was an emphasis on &#8220;investments that will get our country back on track.&#8221; Tellingly, as Carville and Greenberg note, their respondents did not see the debt as a reason to cut Social Security or Medicare.<br />    <br />Third, but more obvious, middle class voters don&#8217;t see government as the solution because they consider it to be captured by elite interests. The focus groups showed that this view led to some tendency to paralysis and disengagement from politics. It is from this point that Carville and Greenberg pivot to their most important policy recommendation: Amend the Constitution or obtain a Supreme Court that will overturn <i>Citizens United</i> and end corporate personhood. In addition, they call for public financing of elections, disclosure of campaign contributions, requiring broadcasters to cut the price of political ads, and ending the revolving door of office holders and lobbyists. All this is in support of a politics that makes rebuilding the middle class Job 1 for government, and for a consistent framing of all issues (including foreign policy) in terms of their impact on the middle class.<br />    <br />Not everything in the book is persuasive. At one point Greenberg says the popularity of raising taxes on the rich &#8220;is as close to an absolute truth you can have in polling&#8221; (p. 144). I have two problems with this. First, you could say the same thing for other industrialized democracies. <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Taxation_and_Democracy.html?id=gAML_smYeHIC">Sven Steinmo</a>, writing in the early 1990s, has cited polling results for the U.S., U.K., and Sweden, all of which showed publics that thought the rich should pay more taxes, yet in none of these cases has that been the direction of policy over the last 30 years. To me, this suggests there is an international dimension that helped make government capture possible, but the book does not address globalization very much at all.<br />    <br />Second, the book devotes relatively little attention to another issue that also is overwhelmingly supported in <a href="http://nelpaction.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/bloomberg-calls-to-raise-new-yorks-minimum-wage-reaffirming-political-economic-popularity-of-wage-increase/">poll after poll</a>: raising the minimum wage. Yes, making work pay is an important theme in the book and the authors acknowledge that increasing the minimum wage is part of that, but they say nothing about how putting the issue on many state ballots helped increase Democratic turnout in 2006. In Missouri, for example, the minimum wage <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Missouri_Minimum_Wage_Act,_Proposition_B_%282006%29">Proposition B passed by a 76-24 margin</a>, helping Claire McCaskill squeak out a U.S. Senate win with less than 50% of the vote.<br />    <br />The other weakness of the book is that the authors are too close to President Clinton to give a completely objective view of his Presidency. While they make a single parenthetical reference about how NAFTA may not have been such a great idea for the middle class after all, they say nothing about how &#8220;ending welfare as we know it&#8221; was bad for the middle class. This can best be seen by thinking about income determination as a massive bargaining situation. Anything that takes away one side&#8217;s options reduces its bargaining power, and the 1996 welfare reform did just that. In addition, they seem blind to the fact that income inequality (top 1% vs. the 20th-80th percentiles) took off during the Clinton Administration far in excess of what had been seen under President Reagan, as a glance at their chart on p. 52 shows.<br />    <br />Finally, the book has no index, which is very annoying when you have 296 pages of text and 25 pages of endnotes.<br />    <br />Those caveats aside, this is a very good book that deserves a careful reading by progressive activists. I certainly learned something from it, and I&#8217;m sure you will, too.</p>

                                <h3>Evidence of Hampered Monetary Policy Transmission Channel in the Euro Area</h3>
<p>by <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a> </p>
<p>Mario Draghi cautioned on the ‘hampered’ transmission channel of monetary policy in his now famous <a href="http://www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2012/html/sp120726.en.html">London speech last week</a>:<br />
<blockquote><em>To the extent that the size of these sovereign premia hampers the functioning of the monetary policy transmission channel, they come within our mandate.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I referred to the clogging of rates policy <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/2012/04/04/ecb-rates-policy-is-clogged-in-key-periphery-markets/">back in April </a>via evidence from mortgage lending rates.<br />
<blockquote><em>I address Draghi’s point that the ECB 1% refi rate will support economic activity through the lens of the mortgage market. Specifically, I find that the interest rate channel is clogged in the economies that are in most desperate need of lower rates: Spain, Portugal, and Italy.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Here I show that on a relative basis, while the household lending rate is quietly trending down for key periphery markets, the real problem lies in the non-financial corporate rates transmission channel. Specifically, rates in Portugal, Italy, and Spain have seriously diverged from both the trend in the refi rate (ECB policy rate) and those of other countries in the Euro area.</p>
<p><strong>The trend in key periphery household mortgage rates is consistent with the ECB rate cuts: down</strong><br /><em>Note: All ECB refi rate data is through June 2012, so the latest rate cut to 75 bps is not included in the charts.</em><br /><em><br /></em><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/cross_hh_rates.jpg"><img alt="" height="395" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/cross_hh_rates.jpg" width="578"></a><br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong></strong><br /><a name="more"></a><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>The magnitude still favors the core</strong> – the drop in German mortgage rates is 91 basis points since the max mortgage rate of the Euro area as a whole in August 2011 – <strong>but the trend is down for all countries</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/hh_change.jpg"><img alt="" height="395" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/hh_change.jpg" width="537"></a><br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>In stark contrast to the trend in household mortgages relative to the ECB refi rate, non-financial corporate lending rates in Portugal, Spain, and Italy diverged from the other country trends.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/cross_nfc.jpg"><img alt="" height="395" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/cross_nfc.jpg" width="578"></a></p>
<p>If the ECB means business on improving the monetary transmission channel, they’ll need to attack the price of corporate loans in the Periphery markets.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rebecca Wilder</em></strong><br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong><br /><strong>Data Note:</strong> All non-financial corporate AAR lending rates is the annualized agreed rate on new business loans with a maturity of greater than 5 years and amount between €0.25 bn and €1 bn. Irish data is not available in Ireland and the Greek data is too sporadic.</p>

                                <p>Yesterday I compared real private GDP in cycles.</p>
<p>Today I would like to look at  real business fixed investment. </p>
<p>If you listened to CNBC &#8212; otherwise known as the Republican Propaganda Channel &#8212; or the campaign claims you would think that all the uncertainty created by Obama was destroying business confidence and that real business fixed investment was collapsing.</p>
<p>But the data shows a different story.  Three years from the economic bottom  real business fixed investment is up some 18.0%, or about the same as during the Clinton years.  In contrast, during  the<br />&#8220;Bush Investment lead Boom&#8221; it was up only up 6.9%, or about a third of the current cyclical rise.</p>

                                <p>Mitt Romney proposes reducing tax brackets by 20% and cutting the estate tax (to zero IIRC).  He will keep or expand favored treatment of capital gains and dividends. He claims that he doesn&#8217;t plan to cut taxes for the rich.  He claims that he will avoid such cuts by eliminating deductions, credits and exclusions.  One of his claims must be false as they are arithmentically inconsistent.</p>
<p>update:  Beyond parody.  Romney aid Lanhee Chen says that the Tax Policy Center conclusion that Romney&#8217;s proposal is gives to the rich is &#8220;biased&#8221; because it ignores Romney&#8217;s proposed corporate income tax cuts</p>
<p>“The study analyzes only half of Governor Romney’s tax program, ignoring the reforms that would make America’s corporations more competitive by moving from the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world to one that is comparable to our trading partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yep that&#8217;s the way to convince the public.  Note that, in addition to tax cuts for rich people, there are tax cuts for corporations.  Importantly Chen does not deny that Romney lied when he said he didn&#8217;t seek tax cuts for the rich.  Chen&#8217;s line is the usual supply side trickle down line that tax cuts for the rich and for corporations will help the non rich by causing greater growth.  I know of no evidence which supports this claim.</p>
<p>I almost feel sorry for the Romney campaign.</p>
<p><a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2012/08/01/13077416-links-for-the-81-trms?lite">In other breaking news (from 2002) Romney claimed he was resident in Utah in 1999 and 2000 before he claimed he was resident in Massachusetts in 1999 and 2000.</a></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t keep track of his lies (hell Steve Benen has trouble).  Wouldn&#8217;t it be easier to keep track of his non-lies ?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2012/08/01-tax-reform-brown-gale-looney">A new report</a> from the Brookings Institution and the Tax Policy Center includes the following.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>The key intuition behind our central result is that, because the total value of the available tax expenditures (once tax expenditures for capital income are excluded) going to high-income taxpayers is smaller than the tax cuts that would accrue to high-income taxpayers, high-income taxpayers must necessarily face a lower net tax burden. As a result, maintaining revenue neutrality mathematically necessitates a shift in the tax burden of at least $86 billion away from high-income taxpayers onto lower- and middle-income taxpayers. This is true even under the assumption that the maximum amount of revenue possible is obtained from cutting tax expenditures for high-income households.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazingly, even if they accept Greg Mankiw&#8217;s estimates of the effect of rate cuts on growth (which assumes no increase in the deficit even in the short run).  They still conclude that a Romney claim must be false.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nevertheless, even if one were to use the model from Mankiw and Weinzierl (2006) and assume that after five years 15 percent of the $360 billion tax cut is paid for through higher economic growth, the available tax expenditures would still need to be cut by 56 percent; on net lower- and middle-income taxpayers would still need to pay higher taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>This analysis will come as a complete shock to exactly zero Angrybear readers (including the conservatives) but might stimulate discussion in comments.</p>
<p>* Title corrected.  The Tax Policy Center is a joint center of the Brookings Institute and the Urban Institute not a separate entity.</p>

<p>Does the Tea Party support Tax Dodgers?</p>
<p>Andrew Leonard&#8217;s July 27 article in Salon, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/07/27/tea_party_shields_tax_dodgers/">Tea Party Shields Tax Dodgers</a>, looks at the way Jim DeMint and Rand Paul are carrying water for the big banks&#8211;suggesting that Treasury shouldn&#8217;t be implementing the &#8220;FATCA&#8221; legislation passed as part of the HIRE act because it might cost the big banks some paperwork they&#8217;d rather not do.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the issue with FATCA. It requires banks to report on substantial accounts held abroad&#8211;more than $50,000 for individuals or more than $250,000 for entities.</p>
<p>The Treasury believes it can generate almost $9 billion in additional tax revenues through the implementation of FATCA over the next ten years. But Paul, DeMint and other right-wingers have complained about the cost to banks to carry out the law.</p>
<p> As Leonard puts it,</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>FATCA isn’t about making life hard for expatriates. It is targeted at big players who are moving huge amounts of cash overseas for the specific purpose of avoiding their U.S. tax obligations. And Rand Paul and Jim DeMint are defending these upstanding members of the 1 percent by carrying water for banks who want to avoid the paperwork costs involved in ferreting out the tax dodgers. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Is that how the Tea Party wants this country to be run — in the best interests of the richest Americans and the banks?</p></blockquote>

<div>Romney&#8217;s plan calls for linking the Pentagon&#8217;s base budget to Gross Domestic Product, and allowing the military to spend at least $4 dollars out of every $100 the American economy produces.”
</p>
</div>
<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/10/news/economy/romney-defense-spending/index.htm">Defense spending to spike $2.1 trillion under Romney</a></i>, CNN Money, May 10, 2012.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>In a post here two weeks ago I noted that peculiar proposal of Romney’s, and also mentioned my dismay that neither the Obama campaign nor (to my knowledge) any other mainstream-media outlet had mentioned it.  I titled the post <i><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/07/crony-capitalism-and-its-variety-of.html">Crony Capitalism and Its Variety of Flavors</a></i>.  The occasion for the post was the Romney campaign’s then-newly-invigorated “crony capitalism” schtik featuring, of course, Solyndra. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I said in the post that, given Romney’s open (if unnoticed) proposal to untether actual national-security <i>needs</i> from national-security <i>spending</i>and attaching it instead to GDP, its purpose is utterly unrelated to national security.  It’s unabashedly “a stunningly perverse pinstriped-patronage version of Keynsian economics,” I said. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>My post got about as much attention as the May 10 CNNMoney report.  But now the Obama campaign<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2012/08/obama_s_ad_against_military_spending_have_polls_shifted_on_the_defense_budget_.html"> has a new ad out</a> highlighting the absurdity of Romney’s plan to <i>increase</i> defense spending—presumably (although the ad doesn’t say this) so that we’ll be prepared when Romney clumsily gets us into an unnecessary war.  (Current candidates as enemies: Britain and the Palestinians, in addition to Iran.)  The ad is excellent.  But it would be even better if it mentioned that Romney’s spending plan doesn’t even <i>purport</i>to be tied to defense <i>needs</i>, but instead to, um, GDP.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It really should point this out and should note the only possible explanation for that.  So should Obama himself.</div>

<p><strong>Cosma Shalizi</strong></p>
<p>I recently was hugely flattered by <a href="http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/925.html">my friend Cosma Shalizi’s articulate argument</a> against <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2011/10/04/data-science-tools-vs-craft/">my position that data science distinguishes itself from statistics</a> in various ways.</p>
<p>Cosma is a well-read broadly educated guy, and a role model for what a statistician can be, not that every statistician lives up to his standard. I’ve enjoyed talking to him about data, big data, and working in industry, and <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2012/01/22/bad-statistics-debunked/">I’ve blogged about his blogposts</a> as well.</p>
<p>That’s not to say I agree with absolutely everything Cosma says <a href="http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/925.html">in his post</a>: in particular, there’s a difference between being a master at visualizations for the statistics audience and being able to put together a power point presentation for a board meeting, which some data scientists in the internet start-up scene definitely need to do (mostly this is a study in how to dumb stuff down without letting it become vapid, and in reading other people’s minds in advance to see what they find sexy).</p>
<p>And communications skills are a funny thing; my experience is communicating with an academic or a quant is a different kettle of fish than communicating with the Head of Product. Each audience has its own dialect.<br />But I totally believe that any statistician who willingly gets a job entitled “Data Scientist” would be able to do these things, it’s a self-selection process after all.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><strong>Statistics and Data Science are on the same team</strong><br />I think that casting statistics as the enemy of data science is a straw man play. The truth is, an earnest, well-trained and careful statistician in a data scientist role would adapt very quickly to it and flourish as well, if he or she could learn to stomach the business-speak and hype (which changes depending on the role, and for certain data science jobs is really not a big part of it, but for others may be).</p>
<p>It would be a petty argument indeed to try to make this into a real fight. As long as academic statisticians are willing to admit they don’t <em>typically</em> spend just as much time (which isn’t to say they never spend as much time) worrying about how long it will take to train a model as they do wondering about the exact conditions under which a paper will be published, and as long as data scientists admit that they mostly just redo linear regression in weirder and weirder ways, then there’s no need for a heated debate at all.<br />Let’s once and for all shake hands and agree that we’re here together, and it’s cool, and we each have something to learn from the other.</p>
<p><strong>Posers</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br />What I <em>really</em> want to rant about today though is something else, namely posers. There are far too many posers out there in the land of data scientists, and it’s getting to the point where I’m starting to regret throwing my hat into that ring.</p>
<p>Without naming names, I’d like to characterize problematic pseudo-mathematical behavior that I witness often enough that I’m consistently riled up. I’ll put aside hyped-up, bullshit publicity stunts and generalized political maneuvering because I believe that stuff speaks for itself.</p>
<p>My basic mathematical complaint is that it’s <strong>not enough to just know how to run a black box algorithm</strong>. You actually need to know how and why it works, so that when it doesn’t work, you can adjust. Let me explain this a bit by analogy with respect to the Rubik’s cube, which <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2012/07/18/hcssim-workshop-day-14/">I taught my beloved math nerd high school students to solve using group theory just last week</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rubiks</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br />First we solved the “position problem” for the 3-by-3-by-3 cube using 3-cycles, and proved it worked, by exhibiting the group acting on the cube, understanding it as a subgroup of <img alt="S_8 \times S_{12}," src="http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_8+%5Ctimes+S_%7B12%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0" title="S_8 \times S_{12},"> and thinking hard about things like the sign of basic actions to prove we’d thought of and resolved everything that could happen. We solved the “orientation problem” similarly, with 3-cycles.</p>
<p>I did this three times, with the three classes, and each time a student would ask me if the algorithm is efficient. No, it’s not efficient, it takes about 4 minutes, and other people can solve it way faster, I’d explain. But the great thing about this algorithm is that it seamlessly generalizes to other problems. Using similar sign arguments and basic 3-cycle moves, you can solve the 7-by-7-by-7 (or any of them actually) and many other shaped Rubik’s-like puzzles as well, which none of the “efficient” algorithms can do.</p>
<p>Something I could have mentioned but didn’t is that the efficient algorithms are <em>memorized</em> by their users, are basically black-box algorithms. I don’t think people understand to any degree why they work. And when they are confronted with a new puzzle, some of those tricks generalize but not all of them, and they need new tricks to deal with centers that get scrambled with “invisible orientations”. And it’s not at all clear they can solve a tetrahedron puzzle, for example, with any success.</p>
<p><strong>Democratizing algorithms: good and bad</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br />Back to data science. It’s a <em>good thing</em> that data algorithms are getting democratized, and I’m all for there being packages in <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a> that let people run clustering algorithms or steepest descent.</p>
<p>But, contrary to the message sent by much of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Andrew Ng’s class on machine learning</a>, you actually <em>do</em> need to understand how to invert a matrix at some point in your life if you want to be a data scientist. And, I’d add, if you’re not smart enough to understand the underlying math, then you’re not smart enough to be a data scientist.</p>
<p>I’m not being a snob. I’m not saying this because I want people to work hard. It’s not a laziness thing, it’s a matter of knowing your shit and being for real. If your model fails, you want to be able to figure out <em>why</em> it failed. The only way to do that is to know how it works to begin with. Even if it worked in a given situation, when you train on slightly different data you might run into something that throws it for a loop, and you’d better be able to figure out what that is. That’s your job.</p>
<p>As I see it, there are three problems with the democratization of algorithms:

<li>As described already, it lets people who can load data and press a button describe themselves as data scientists. </li>
<li>It tempts companies to never hire anyone who actually <em>knows</em> how these things work, because they don’t see the point. This is a mistake, and could have dire consequences, both for the company and for the world, depending on how widely their crappy models get used. </li>
<li>Businesses might think they have awesome data scientists when they don’t. That’s not an easy problem to fix from the business side: posers can be fantastically successful exactly because non-data scientists who hire data scientists in business, i.e. business people, don’t know how to test for real understanding.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How do we purge the posers?</strong><br />We need to come up with a plan to purge the posers, they are annoying and making a bad name for data science.</p>
<p>One thing that will be helpful in this direction is <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/STAT/W4242-20123-001/">Rachel Schutt’s Data Science class at Columbia</a> next semester, which is going to be a much-needed bullshit free zone. Note there’s been a time change that hasn’t been reflected on the announcement yet, namely it’s going to be once a week, Wednesdays for three hours starting at 6:15pm. I’m looking forward to blogging on the contents of these lectures.</p>

<p>I thought it would be interesting to post this chart of real private GDP in recoveries.</p>
<p>It clearly shows that since the great moderation we have experienced three recoveries that compared to previous recoveries were very weak.  Whether this is the new norm is open to debate.</p>
<p>But interestingly, at this point in the recovery this measure of real private GDP is exactly the same as it was in the last cycle under Bush that Larry Kudlow called the &#8220;Goldilocks&#8221; recovery.</p>
