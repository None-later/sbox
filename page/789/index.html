<blockquote><p>&#8230;not only is Blackwater immunized from liability under any Iraqi law, but the State Department has allowed it to operate under less restrictive rules of engagement than any other private military company. As a result, the State Department bears responsibility for the culture of impunity that resulted.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year, Congress passed a law placing contractors under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the law that establishes legal conduct for U.S. forces. Little follow-on work has established what exactly that means for private security companies, however. While the Pentagon has issued a number of so-called fragmentary orders seeking to regulate the private security firms, Blackwater is exempt, since its contracts are with the State Department and CIA. Blackwater isn&#8217;t required to keep the U.S. military command informed of its operations or file incident reports to it.</p></blockquote>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Anyone who says, as I did a few times, that the Surge doesn&#8217;t seem to be working gets asked some variation of the same question&#8230;  &#8220;Why should I believe you rather than David Petraeus, the top military officer in Iraq?&#8221;</p>
<p>Its a fair question.  After all, presumably Petraeus has access to more and better information, and as a military guy, on the ground, he has more familiarity and a better feel for what is going on.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing.  Some of us pointed out back in January that the Surge wasn&#8217;t going to produce results.  Now, if you think the Surge is working, that means nothing.  But we can go farther back..  Some of us have been pointing out for a while that things were getting worse&#8230; while those that were at that time the military commanders in Iraq were saying otherwise.   Some of us even expected things to become a mess in Iraq in 2003 based on what we had seen our leaders do in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>So perhaps the relevant question is not&#8230;  what right do these doubters have to question the wisdom of David Petraues, but rather&#8230; why should we take the word of a guy who is saying the same things as the folks who have been wrong all along over the opinion of people who have been right so far?  What makes Petraeus different than his predecessors?  The administration, and those who have been wrong on everything so far, tell us he is more brilliant than his predecessors.  But if they are capable of seeing this difference&#8230; why were his predecessors given the job before him?  I recognize there are seniority issues, but still?  Also, if he is that good, shouldn&#8217;t the tasks he was in charge of earlier have borne fruit &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t the Iraqi military be doing a good job given he was in charge of training them?</p>
<p>Now, someone might ask me&#8230;  &#8220;Well, you consider yourself an expert in a few things.  How would you feel if complete amateur questioned you on what you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, here&#8217;s the thing&#8230;  I try to play down how much I trade on being an expert.  My business cards don&#8217;t have the letters &#8220;Ph.D.&#8221; on them.  Anywhere.  On some occasions, for some purposes, I have allowed those letters to appear after my name, but I generally avoid it.  And I don&#8217;t tend to argue based on the fact that I have worked on something for years.  (I do try to trade on my past results and what I think I can deliver going forward, which is a bit different.) Sometimes its useful or even necessary for marketing purposes &#8211; as shorthand or signal to indicate where the discussion can start &#8211; but I&#8217;m always suspicious of anyone who argues any point based on their own authority.</p>
<p>Additionally, generally (not always, but generally), one can more easily argue one&#8217;s point by being open and transparent and arguing and presenting the data that is available.  Those who keep information squirreled away usually have a reason for behaving squirrelly.  (E.g., including in one&#8217;s data points the &#8220;Great Tax Hike of 2005&#8221; (y&#8217;all remember how triumphantly GW and Tom DeLay were in the signing statement for that one, being all fiscally responsible and rubbing it in on the Dems who so wanted lower tax rates for Paris Hilton?) and the big tax increase in 1982, characterized, as only an increase can be, by a huge drop in the top marginal rate, as well as drops in the bottom marginal rate and the cap gains rate.)  </p>
<p>And there&#8217;s one more problem sign &#8211; does the person admit mistakes.  A true expert generally does, and generally does so early.  One reason is that a true expert realizes how obvious the outcome is going to be very soon to those who are informed.  Another is a true expert in a field got that way by learning, and the only way to learn is to change your opinion when you&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>So yeah&#8230; I&#8217;m perfectly comfortable with people arguing with me about topics in which I think I&#8217;m an expert and they will readily admit no expertise at all.  In fact, I&#8217;m used to it.  And part of what I have to do, on a daily basis, is to try to make the point I&#8217;m making both in a way that makes sense to others who think they&#8217;re experts and to those who don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re experts.  I don&#8217;t always succeed, of course, but I like to think I do succeed reasonably often when both sides are arguing in good faith.  So why should I not be comfortable questioning experts in other fields?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0709/20/ldt.01.html">Lori Wallach</a> of Global Trade Watch had an interesting twist on the dangerous products coming out of developing countries, especially China, a twist that I have been interested in for the last few years: Everything goes back to our trade agreements, or more pointedly, to how entry into the WTO has been structured.</p>
<p>Because of cheap labor, little in the way of environmental or product regulations, and great tax breaks (remember: FDI companies in China paid 15% taxation, while indigenous firms, 30%), manufacturing firms fled the U.S. to third world countries. China was and still is the new economic nirvana.</p>
<p>With NAFTA, firms went to Mexico. Then came China&#8217;s entry into the WTO. China is far bigger than Mexico with a huge, disciplined labor force. (Mexico is now feeling the pressure of China&#8217;s competition.)</p>
<p>Wallach points out that companies like Mattel &#8220;pushes its suppliers, its manufacturers, its subcontractors in China to cut costs&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, we should remember that <i>Mattel is the primary manufacturer of these toys</i>. They may outsource, subcontract, call it what you will, but they are the manufacturer. Mattel makes the toys. Period. Mattel is in the business of making toys, just as Fisher-Price was. (Mattel bought Fisher-Price.)</p>
<p>If you want to trace the problem back to its roots, try it this way. Mattel, seeking the cheapest place to make its toys and to increase its profits, goes to those countries offering the greatest benefit. When the WTO welcomed China into its fold&#8211;despite the fact that there was absolutely no effective environmental or product regulatory body, no effective protection of labor standards or conditions, the WTO set the wheels in motion that led eventually to the shoddy products now issuing from China. Mattel is, of course, horrified. It&#8217;s all the fault of those careless Chinese. Bullshit.</p>
<p>Mattel is passing the buck. Mattel, I repeat, is the manufacturer. The workers in those Chinese factories make peanuts. The real pig on the block is Mattel. And who fattened this pig? WTO trade policy.</p>
<p>Who pushed for China&#8217;s entry into the WTO before China was ready? Why, our own corporations, of course. China has become an export platform before it was ready to become one.</p>
<p>Trade agreements are made for corporations, not workers or the environment, or finally not even the consumers, although the last is where the consumer finally starts to pay attention. Take a look at worker conditions and environmental conditions in the maquiladoras, a direct result of NAFTA.</p>
<p>At some point we are going to have to lay all these problems at the feet of our trade policies and, of course, the WTO.</p>
<p>Most economists refuse to look at the source of the problem: How trade policy is fashioned. Yes, they occasionally complain about how third world countries are screwed with their agricultural products or how protectionists measures are built into the agreements favoring large corporations.</p>
<p>What economists refuse to do is to look at how the game has been structured. Labor arbitrage and environmental arbitrage do not matter. Those are natural advantages that a country can offer, they would say.</p>
<p>I say they do matter&#8230;. a lot.</p>
<p>If a country despoils its environment, that despoilment affects us all. Lest you forget, China is slated this year to become the number one emitter of CO2. China&#8217;s non-CO2-pollution-clouds now have world wide reach; they are visible from outer space, great brown splotches. (The Olympics will be quite interesting.) And I have not mentioned the poisoned rivers or lands. Who profits? We do, of course: cheap products. And, of course, our companies&#8211;Intel, Mattel, Apple, etc. do. Sometimes they are directly responsible; often they simply profit indirectly: If a country pays little attention to the environment, it can afford to tax less, making doing business much cheaper.</p>
<p>If a country does not protect its workers, or does not allow them to bargain collectively, that affects every other worker in the world.</p>
<p>There are ways to globalize, to pull countries into real trade agreements that will test and reward ingenuity and hardwork.</p>
<p>Insist that the environment be protected. Insist that workers be protected. Insisting on these conditions is not being protectionist. It is acknowledging that some kinds of regulations and protections benefit of us all, Chinese as well as Americans.</p>
<p>Protectionism has never been the real issue. It&#8217;s a strawman, erected by those who do not want to discuss how trade agreements are structured.</p>

<blockquote><p>The surge is working so well that our own CIA agents &#8212; trained for months at &#8220;The Farm&#8221; in Virginia to learn how to kill a man with a ballpoint pen, and that sort of thing &#8212; are now afraid to walk out the front door without a bevy of allegedly trigger-happy men toting machine guns and firing indiscriminately?</p></blockquote>
<p>As I&#8217;ve asked on other posts&#8230; what are the signs that the Surge is working?  In particular, what are the signs that the Surge is working that are distinguishable from the signs that the Surge is not working?</p>

                                <p>In my Comparing Presidents series, I’ve looked at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-receipts-outlays.html">tax revenues, federal outlays, and the surplus and/or deficit</a> as a percentage of GDP.  But I was thinking of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/bush-rebuts-greenspans-critique-of.html">PGL’s post</a> in which we learn that according to GW, “cutting taxes… made a significant difference in dealing with the deficit because the growing economy yielded more tax revenues.”  I trust everyone reading this post knows GW is wrong about increased tax revenues.  I want to show, though, just how wrong by looking at real tax collections per capita since 1952, and also at real spending per capita over the same time period.  Not just to poke fun at GW – it seems there are a lot of misinformed people out there and I figured a picture or two are always nice in a situation like this</p>
<p>Data for this post is as follows:<br />1.  Real receipts and outlays come from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z3.xls">OMB table 1.3</a><br />2.  Population comes from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  I used the population for the quarter in which the fiscal year came to an end…  the second quarter until 1976, and the third quarter thereafter.  </p>
<p>Here’s a graph of tax receipts per capita. </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvHTvK3oXaI/AAAAAAAAAsw/W_98Wgdh3Eg/s1600-h/Tax+Receipts+-+Real+Tax+Receipts+per+Capita+(2000+dollars).jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvHTvK3oXaI/AAAAAAAAAsw/W_98Wgdh3Eg/s320/Tax+Receipts+-+Real+Tax+Receipts+per+Capita+(2000+dollars).jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Hmmmm… Looks like there was, if anything, a drop in real tax revenues per capita.  Sure, since revenues bottomed out in 2003, real revenues per person have risen sharply… but in 2006, the last year for which we have data, they still were less than they had been in 2000, and 2001.  Now, GW would blame the recession, but that ended in November of 2001.  Presumably if the recession was at fault, the bottom would have been in 2001 or 2002 (depending on whether wage earners or those who pay their taxes quarterly got hit the hardest).  Regardless, it wouldn’t have been in 2003.  Ditto using 9/11 as an excuse.  In fact, the most obvious reason why tax receipts stopped falling in 2004 is that 2004 is also the year in which <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/tax-rates-and-economic-growth-look-at.html">tax rates stopped falling</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of the percentage change…</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvHTpq3oXZI/AAAAAAAAAso/EsuTWrMdzaQ/s1600-h/Tax+Receipts+-+Annualized+Growth+in+Real+Tax+Receipts+per+Capita.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvHTpq3oXZI/AAAAAAAAAso/EsuTWrMdzaQ/s320/Tax+Receipts+-+Annualized+Growth+in+Real+Tax+Receipts+per+Capita.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>One doesn’t even need color coding to spot the difference between Dems and Reps.  Now, one might say… well, Reps don’t think collecting more in taxes is a good thing.  There are three problems with this…  the first is that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-receipts-outlays.html">in most years in this sample, there was a deficit</a> and in every year of the sample, there was a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-national-debt.html">national debt</a>.  Big one, too.  Now, one could discount this if the group collecting taxes – i.e., Republicans – also produced faster growth as a result.  Problem two is that they don’t – in fact, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">economic growth is slower</a> among those that collect less in tax revenue.  And then there’s problem 3 – a number of Republican Presidents (not mention Republican candidates) have promised that cutting taxes would (or, as per the growth above did) lead to faster growth and more taxes being collected.  </p>
<p>And so we come back to GW and others who insist over and over and over that cutting tax rates leads to increased tax collections…  some are liars, some are buffoonishly ignorant about the topic, and some are both.  But every one of them fits into one of these three categories.  I don&#8217;t see any other options.  Do you?</p>

I knew there was an unscheduled meeting on 4/18/2001 where the FED cut interest rates by 0.5% but it  turns out that the 1/31/2001 meeting where they did the same was also unscheduled.  It would seem that the FED in 2001 was acting proactively to shore up aggregate demand.  </p>

<p>It is a very rare day that <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=09&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=fed_cuts_rates_by_half_point_a">Dean Baker</a> makes a mistake but we have him on a minor one:</p>
<blockquote><p>The coverage of the Fed&#8217;s half point cut in interest rates yesterday highlighted the enthusiastic response of the markets. According to much of the coverage, the markets soared yesterday because they are now confident that Bernanke will move aggressively to try to counteract a recession. A bit of history would have been useful to include in this context. As some articles noted, this cut bears a resemblance to the Fed&#8217;s 0.5 percentage point cut in January of 2001 at an unscheduled emergency meeting. That cut also led to a very enthusiastic response from Wall Street. The Dow rose 2.8 percent following that cut and the Nasdaq jumped by a record 14.2 percent. In reporting on the significance of the cut, the NYT quoted Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch: &#8220;there&#8217;s a simple message, the Fed will do whatever it takes to keep the U.S. economy from going down the tubes.&#8221;  Mr. Steinberg may have been right about the Fed&#8217;s intentions. It did continue to cut interest rates, lowering the federal funds rate by a total of 5.5 percentage points to 1.0 percent, the lowest rate since the mid-fifties. However, this rate cutting did not prevent the economy from falling into a recession. It began to lose jobs just a month after the January rate cut. In spite of the Fed&#8217;s aggressive rate cutting, the economy remained so weak that it took four full years to once again reach the employment levels of February 2001.  The lesson from the 2001 experience is that cutting interest rates is not necessarily a very effective tool in counteracting the impact of a collapsing asset bubble.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean’s larger point is right so you may have missed the minor point.  Fortunately, we have an April 18, 2001 by <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article/0,1902,23789,00.html">Anya Schiffrin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stock investors are cheering the Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision to cut interest rates at a surprise meeting Wednesday, but it doesn&#8217;t appear that Alan Greenspan &#038; Co. were talking to them. The Fed, which slashed the federal funds rate to a seven-year low of 4.5% from 5%, and the discount rate to 4% from 4.5%, seems to have been intent on spurring investment by U.S. companies. Getting companies to continue spending is key if the economy is to grow, and the Fed said in its statement that it is worried that capital investment has &#8220;continued to soften.&#8221; This softening, combined with slow growth overseas and the effect of layoffs and the declining stock market on consumer spending &#8220;threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems Dean’s larger point is borne out even if he had the date of this surprise 0.5 percent decline off by a few months.  Back then – as is the case now – the fear is that the IS curve has shifted inwards.  Lower interest rates are supposed to move us along the IS curve back to full employment but if the inward shift of the IS curve is large enough and if the interest elasticity of the IS curve is small enough, aggregate demand might still decline. </p>
<p>Now you might ask – wouldn’t a large decline in interest rates still reverse the decline in aggregate demand?  Maybe but check out our graph of the Federal funds rate from early 2001 to late 2004.  The FED did massively lower interest rates and we did eventually see a reversal of weak aggregate demand.  But as we noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/anatomy-of-recovery-delong-smack-down.html">here</a>, John Cassidy’s claim that we had a robust recovery in 2002 is flat wrong.  I wonder if <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/09/kpcc-radio-fede.html">Brad DeLong</a> got this across to Mr. Cassidy when they appeared on Larry Mantle’s radio show?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: On January 31, 2001, the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/2001/20010131">FED met</a> and cut the target rate from 6 percent to 5.5 percent and expressed confidence that we would avoid a recession:</p>
<blockquote><p>Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer purchasing power and press on business profit margins. Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably. In response, manufacturing production has been cut back sharply, with new technologies appearing to have accelerated the response of production and demand to potential excesses in the stock of inventories and capital equipment. Taken together, and with inflation contained, these circumstances have called for a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy. The longer-term advances in technology and accompanying gains in productivity, however, exhibit few signs of abating and these gains, along with the lower interest rates, should support growth of the economy over time. Nonetheless, the Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FED statement after that surprise decision on April 18, 2001 can be found <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/2001/20010418">here</a> and its tone was less optimistic than the tone back on January 31, 2001.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post_group/ObamaHQ/CWrm">Obama ‘08</a> calls his new proposal “tax fairness”.  It does have a few tax cuts for the average Joe, but <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_09/012095.php">Kevin Drum</a> is not exactly impressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know that it&#8217;s unfair to expect Obama to live up to his own hype every day. Not every proposal from his campaign is really going to be bold and innovative, even if he says it is. But really, if he&#8217;s planning to campaign as the guy with fresh ideas, he&#8217;s going to have to do better than this.</p></blockquote>
<p>I see the Republicans topping the modest tax cuts that Senator Obama is proposing by promsing larger tax cuts for everyone.  But that’s the problem.  The GOP is all about Spend&#038;Spend and Borrow&#038;Borrow, which simply means deferring the tax bite.  I don’t want Democrats promising voters that money grows on trees.  So I read down to see where Senator Obama might try to actually increase tax revenues and found this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama would pay for his tax reform plan by closing corporate loopholes, cracking down on international tax havens, closing the carried interest loophole, and increasing the dividends and capital gains rate for the top bracket.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope he means it and he finds a way that we can better enforce the current tax laws – including enforcement of section 482.  The current Administration doesn’t seem so interested in insuring that U.S. based multinationals don’t shift income to the tax havens.  So good for the Senator for proposing the obvious.  But let’s not get too carried away as to how easy this will be or how much in revenues this will raise.</p>

                                <p>Some problems are intractable; they simply must play themselves to the bitter end.  In today’s New York Times, I see two:</p>
<p>The first lays out the problems for Iraqi partition; the second comments on the latest Fed move, cutting interest rates by 50 bps.</p>
<p>The Iraq disaster, which we own and must acknowledge, has no easy fix.  Tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of Iraqi’s are displaced, impoverished, killed or wounded. The U.S. worries about its dead and wounded, or the financial burden of the war.  Our losses pale before Iraqi<a href="http://icasualties.org/oif/"> losses</a>.  Total U.S. and UK casualties are under 5000.</p>
<p>As of March, 2005, <a href="http://icasualties.org/oif/IraqiDeaths.aspx">&#8220;official&#8221;</a> count of Iraqi civilian casualties is 37,551.  Remember the war begin in March, 2003. Officially, we have no count for two years.</p>
<p>There are many places to go to make the comparison.  Whatever numbers you choose, Iraqi’s have suffered enormously compared to coalition forces.  And we have not begun to measure Iraqi refugees, which certainly exceed a million or more. Nor have we begun to begun to measure the financial cost to Iraq.  </p>
<p>The immorality and stupidity of the invasion remain intractable no matter what we do now: Leave or surge.  Perhaps an apology and jail time should be required of those who led us into the war.  That alone might help.</p>
<p>The second problem is, of course, the sub prime carnage, which is indicative of a deeper issue: Living well beyond our means.  After 2001, the Fed lowered interest rates.  Meanwhile, industry after industry fled abroad to make easier bucks through labor, tax, and environmental arbitrage.  Easy credit allowed not only the housing boom but allowed consumers to use MEW (mortgage equity withdrawal) and easy credit in general to spend at an accelerated pace, even as our trade balance fell and our debt, personal and public, rose.  We primed the pump; we really primed the pump.  Priming did not improve our investment at home; it had no bearing on our trade deficit—and it should have had.</p>
<p>Now, once again, the Fed is coming to the rescue with easier credit; &#8220;Prime it again,&#8221; Sam.  Bills have to be paid; the piper will have his due, now or later.  And he charges interest.  One way or another, this problem will play itself through to the bitter end.  </p>
<p>Behind these two problems, lies two more, far more intractable: Energy and Global Warming.</p>
<p>Oil is becoming more expensive in real terms even as the dollar weakens.  The weakening dollar only exacerbates the cost of oil, which is inflationary, of course.  (The Fed is between a rock and a hard place on this one. Ease up the credit to alleviate the credit crunch; meanwhile, the cost of energy will be inflationary.)  Like it or not, we are approaching peak oil; use whatever definition you want for this one. It is a limited resource.  I prefer thinking of it this way: Demand approaches the capacity of the spigot.</p>
<p>Global Warming and all its associated ills?  You all have heard enough from me on this one.  Global warming is not yet at our front door, nor will it be for a couple of years.  But when it comes, we will rue the day we were so cavalier at its approach.</p>

                                <p>We have been discussing a lot of economics through the political viewer lately. And I certainly have laid my point of view out there, but I also like the theory discussion. I like to think and know how stuff works or how someone interprets what they see. I believe discussing theories leads to better political discussion. With that, I hope this might inspire some tangent topics into the political here at AB.</p>
<p>This is a paper out of France by <a href="http://www.iea.org/Textbase/work/2004/eewp/Ayres-paper1.pdf">Robert U Ayres &#038; Benjamin Warr </a>titled: Accounting for Growth: The role of physical work</p>
<p>They suggest the increasing extraction of work from energy do to the increasing development of energy use is the missing factor that explains our growth.<br />
<blockquote>“However the major result of the paper is that it is not `raw’ energy (exergy) as an input, but exergy converted to useful (physical) work that – along with capital and(human)labor – really explains output and drives long-term economic growth.” “However, if we replace raw energy as an input by `useful work’ (the sum total of all types of physical work by animals, prime movers and heat transfer systems) as a factor of production, the historical growth path of the US is reproduced with high accuracy from 1900 until the mid 1970s, without any residual except during brief periods of economic dislocation, and with fairly high accuracy since then.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There key concept is the definition of exergy.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The formal definition of exergy is the maximum work that could theoretically be done by a system as it approaches thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings, reversibly. Thus exergy is effectively equivalent to potential work. There is an important distinction between potential work and actual work done by animals or machines. The conversion efficiency between exergy (potential work), as an input, and actual work done, as an output, is also an important concept in thermodynamics. The notion of thermodynamic efficiency plays a key role in this paper.<br />To summarize: the technical definition of exergy is the maximum work that a subsystem can do as it approaches thermodynamic equilibrium (reversibly) with its surroundings.” </p></blockquote>
<p>This summarizes their theories development:</p>
<blockquote><p>The supposed link between factor payments and factor productivities gives the national accounts a direct and fundamental (but spurious) role in production theory. In reality, however, (as noted in the introduction) the economy produces final products from a chain of intermediates, not directly from raw materials or, still less, from labor and capital without material inputs. In the simple single sector model used to `prove’ the relationship between factor productivity and factor payments, this crucial fact is neglected. Allowing for the omission of intermediates (by introducing even a two-sector or three-sector production process) the picture changes completely. In effect, downstream value-added stages act as productivity multipliers. This enables a factor receiving a very small share of the national income directly, to contribute a much larger effective share of the value of aggregate production, i.e. to be much more productive than its share of overall labor and capital would seem to imply if the simple theory of income allocation were applicable [Ayres 2001a].</p></blockquote>
<p>If this is true, then we have a bigger problem concerning how to keep this boat floating than subprime lending and fed rates. We have a policy problem. And that speaks to all the work Cactus has done about presidents.</p>
<p>Related to Cactus&#8217; work, this chart from the this paper is interesting. It is the unexplained portion of growth by their theory.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RvFd-TN21tI/AAAAAAAAAEE/6Xmt5OvRtiQ/s1600-h/Accounting+for+Growth+Chart+1.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RvFd-TN21tI/AAAAAAAAAEE/6Xmt5OvRtiQ/s320/Accounting+for+Growth+Chart+1.JPG" border="0"></a>
<div>Note that this phenomenon begins right about where we see the lowest point of the top 1% share of income, just after we see the split of productivity from wages and the beginnings of the supplyside policies and a change to a net debtor nation. The authors suggest some of this is do to conservation.</div>
<p>
<blockquote>“We conjecture that a kind of phase-change or structural shift took place at that time, triggered perhaps by the so-called energy crisis, precipitated by the OPEC blockade. Higher energy prices induced significant investments in energy conservation and systems optimization.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
<div>They further refine the explanation with:</div>
<p>
<blockquote>“The marginal productivity of capital has started to increase whereas the marginal productivity of physical work – resulting from increases in the efficiency of energy conversion – has declined slightly.”</p></blockquote>
<div>Could this marginal capital productivity increase be a result of our policy focus on capital as the driver of growth? Money from money? Are we seeing in their explanation that part of our growth that is borrowed from our future, thus artificially created? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I read this paper it made me think about the European economies who have been focusing on alternative energy development, wind in Denmark, solar in Germany, (Japan), wave generation in England and northern parts, geothermal in Iceland/Greenland. This paper to me suggests that this coming election has at the core of all our topical issues (health care, war, inflation) energy. As the authors conclude keeping in mind peak production issues and the declining output of Saudi&#8217;s fields: </div>
<div>
<blockquote>“From a long-term sustainability viewpoint, this conclusion carries a powerful implication. If economic growth is to continue without proportional increases in fossil fuel consumption, it is vitally important to exploit new ways of generating value added without doing more work. But it is also essential to develop ways of reducing fossil fuel exergy inputs per unit of physical work output (i.e. increasing conversion efficiency). In other words, energy (exergy) conservation is probably the main key to long term environmental sustainability.”</p></blockquote>

<p>[note from cactus &#8211; apologies for the delay in posting this which makes the timing off, I&#8217;ve been traveling]</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>For some time aficionados of financial markets have been jabbering about “Black Swans” and “triggering events” and things like that in order to try and predict what’s going to be the ultimate result of the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US .  Risky US mortgages were packaged and sold around the world as “mortgage backed securities.”  A major German bank has had to be rescued after buying this crap, and 157 US mortgage lending intuitions have failed as home buyers failed to pay their debts on time.  In the course of investigating different sources of information and opinion, we note this morning that the Bank of England is declaring some very broad and very public guarantees to depositors of Northern Rock savings and loan society in England, where they’ve had crowds lining up to pull out their deposits.  We also note this morning that the Russian stock market has fallen 10% in the last month or so, largely on foreign investors withdrawing their money. </p>
<p>Likewise we’ve been thinking that a crisis in one mortgage and real estate market like the US may not be isolated, because the housing “bubble” in prices is universal and not local to the US .  Ireland, Spain, China, and India for example, have all seen pure price inflation of housing much greater than in the US .  Does that mean they have pockets of rot in their lending institutions?  Are their mortgage markets and credit practices prudent?   Are they also, like the US , vulnerable to major corrections in housing prices with real economic effects to follow?  Based on the UK experience, outlined in gory detail below, we know there are pockets of rot.  Maybe not in every single market, but in enough to have follow-on consequences in world stock and currency markets.</p>
<p>In this light, and with a major US Federal Reserve Board meeting likely to cut US interest rates a bit this afternoon, we wonder just how much good a rate cut or two will do at this stage of the game?  Are such cuts trivial in a global sense?  After all, it’s not “liquidity” in the banking sectors of the world that are the problem, but risky loans made to poor credit risk home buyers and businesses.  If you can’t pay a million bucks for a house, it won’t matter what the interest rate is or is not, will it? </p>
