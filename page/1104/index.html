                                <p>Brad DeLong gives us <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004-2_archives/000503.html">an excellent discussion of some fiscal policy possibilities</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we were going to get concrete, and, say, take the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 and try to assess their dynamic supply-side effects within a model in which the government budget constraint is satisfied as it will be satisfied, what would we have to do? I believe that we would have to model the satisfaction of the government budget constraint as a probabilistic combination of three different possibilities:
<ol>
<li>Recognize that there is a chance that the tax cut will be reversed. Perhaps once again, as in the early 1990s, an unwillingness to cut spending combined with mounting debt and debt servicing costs changes the complexion of politics. I would have said that the chances of this are high given the 7% of GDP long-run fiscal deficit that America appears to have, and the unwillingness of any politician to propose cuts in the growth rates of Medicare and Social Security spending. But the chances of this have dropped since Kerry reached his peak bubble value of 80% on the Iowa Electronic Markets Tuesday afternoon. </p>
</li>
<li>Recognize that there is a chance that there will be a long period of rising debt and debt burdens accompanied by cutbacks in spending shares as various institutional mechanisms force the legislature to face and try to meet the government budget constraint. We know what George W. Bush thinks of the pay-as-you-go mechanisms that restrained Congressional action so effectively in the 1990s: he thinks they are a joke: &#8220;You know what pay-go means? It means you pay&#8211;and [Kerry] goes and spends!&#8221; I would say that the chances of this have also dropped since Tuesday afternoon.
</li>
<li>Last, there is the remaining possibility: that the government budget constraint itself will take its own non-policy steps to make sure that it is met, and generate an Argentina-style meltdown. By the principle that probabilities sum to one, I conclude that the chances of this have risen since Tuesday afternoon.</li>
</ol>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A few economists think that <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B89A90FE9-702C-4974-94DF-7BB8CED8A1E9%7D&#038;siteid=mktw">he actually might</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) &#8212; He never felt the need to recite his father&#8217;s infamous &#8220;no new taxes&#8221; pledge, and yet President Bush ran for re-election on a tacit promise to extend the tax cuts he lobbied so hard to pass in his first term.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, say some analysts, the reality of wartime spending and other obligations make it increasingly likely that Washington will be forced to consider tax increases, rather than cuts.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Bush is very much against raising taxes,&#8221; said Alan Auerbach, an economist at U.C. Berkeley who worked on the Kerry campaign. &#8220;On the other hand, he&#8217;s got a war. He just asked for an additional appropriation for that. Expenditures on large entitlement programs are going up every year. That is not a sustainable path. He&#8217;s going to have to do something.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t say he&#8217;s painted himself into a corner but he&#8217;s made it pretty clear he wants to make his tax cuts permanent. He&#8217;s also made it clear he&#8217;s not in the mood to introduce new taxes. It&#8217;s not clear how he&#8217;s going to accomplish this.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8230;&#8221;Within the next six months or so, (Bush) is more than likely going to be forced into a major budget deal that will include a significant element of higher taxes,&#8221; said Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research group.</p>
<p>Some economists, including Bartlett, say there are a variety of economic triggers that could push Congress to move fast to restrain the deficit through higher taxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is going to be forced onto Congress by the markets,&#8221; Bartlett said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d like to think that Auerbach and Bartlett are right, but I&#8217;m quite sceptical.  Given the well-established track record of ideology trumping sound policy in the Bush administration, I think that even when the financial markets start sending clear signals that the budget deficits are hurting the economy, Bush will choose not to see those signals.  Economic growth will suffer, but Bush will refuse to believe that the budget deficit is the cause.  After all, according to Bush&#8217;s way of thinking, when things don&#8217;t go well it&#8217;s never his fault&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Well, Kash is certainly taking <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/11/dont-despair.html">the optimistic high road</a>, and in a few more days I&#8217;ll likely come to agree with him (in fact, I already do agree with his statement that, &#8220;The nation will survive, and recover from the Bush presidency &#8230; We’ve already survived four years of more-or-less complete Republican control in Washington.) But for now I&#8217;m still angry, and I&#8217;m particularly angered by the role bigotry parading as concern over &#8220;Moral Values&#8221; played in turning the tide in Bush&#8217;s favor.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled. &#8220;<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/11/03/60II/main653593.shtml">Moral Values</a>&#8221; is a code phrase, at least among a subset of the population, for a <a href="http://www.thepoorman.net/archives/003425.html">set of bigoted beliefs</a> rooted in fear, hatred, and ignorance. Fear of all Muslims. Hatred of gays. Ignorance of, well, many things ranging from the economic risks of soaring deficits to the <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/pressingissues_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000619251">lack of WMD in Iraq</a>. And it turns out that there&#8217;s more of them than there are of us. Writing at Altercation, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3449870/">Charles Pierce explains</a>:<br />
<br /><strong></strong><br />
<blockquote>Let’s face it. It’s not Kerry’s fault. It’s not Nader’s fault (this time). It’s not the media’s fault (though they do bear a heavy responsibility for much of what ails our political system). It’s not “our” fault either. The problem is just this: Slightly more than half of the citizens of this country simply do not care about what those of us in the “reality-based community” say or believe about anything.</p>
<p>They don’t care that Iraq is turning into murderous quicksand and a killing field for our children. They don’t care that the Bush presidency has made us less safe by creating more terrorists, inspiring more anti-American hatred and refusing to engage in the hard work that would be necessary to make a meaningful dent in our myriad vulnerabilities at home. They don’t care that he has mortgaged our children’s future to give trillions to the wealthiest among us. They don’t care that the economy continues to hemorrhage well-paying jobs and replace them with Wal-Mart; that the number without health insurance is over forty million and rising. They don’t care that Medicare premiums are rising to fund the coffers of pharmaceutical companies. They don’t care that the air they breathe and the water they drink is being slowly poisoned and though they call themselves conservatives, they even don’t care that the size of the government and its share of our national income has increased by roughly a quarter in just four years. This is not a world of rational debate and issue preference. </p></blockquote>
<p>Well said. It was this very realization that inspired my first post-election post, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/11/karl-rove-is-evil-genius.html">Karl Rove Is an Evil Genius</a>, in which I basically advocated a mini-secession by the Blue states. Well, not so much a secession as an extreme form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism">federalism</a> in which the wealthy states (i.e., Blue) stop <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/RedvBlue.gif">subsidizing</a> the poor states (guess which color), and then spend the savings in a way consistent with their own priorities and values. I think it actually could be done to some extent; all the Democrats have to do is embrace the Republican&#8217;s rhetoric and turn it, judo style, against them. In the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/app/Actually,%20it%20will%20be%20relatively%20easy%20to%20cut%20off%20the%20spigot%20to%20the%20Red%20states.%20Simply%20stop%20resisting%20the%20reactionary%20tax%20cuts%20Bush%20wants.%20Do%20you%20think%20the%20cut%20on%20dividend%20taxes%20flowed%20Red?%20No%20way%20--%20Krugman%20had%20an%20op%20ed%20piece%20comparing%20how%20that%20cut%20brought%20money%20into%20New%20Jersey%20and%20away%20from%20Mississippi.">comments to the earlier post</a>, Roger (who also <a href="http://www.limitedinc.blogspot.com/">has a blog</a>) gave a great example of what I mean:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Actually, it will be relatively easy to cut off the spigot to the Red states. Simply stop resisting the reactionary tax cuts Bush wants. Do you think the cut on dividend taxes flowed Red? No way &#8212; Krugman had an op ed piece comparing how that cut brought money into New Jersey and away from Mississippi.</p>
<p>The investors simply live in the Blue states. The argument against cutting taxes for investors was a class based one &#8212; but if the Southern working poor vote for their own impoverishment just so they can punish infidels, well &#8212; it might be time to let them get what they have so devoutly wished for.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another measure Blue states could take is to abolish sales taxes and replace them with income taxes, which are deducted from federal taxable income. Is this really a good idea? In an ideal world, or even just a reality-based one, I don&#8217;t think so. But if the alternative is more of what we&#8217;ve had the last four years and will have for at least the next four, then it just might be <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/s.html">second-best</a>, which is a term economists use for &#8220;the optimal policy when the true optimum (the first best) is unavailable due to constraints on policy choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as Kash points out, life does go on and I&#8217;ve got a conference to get ready for. I&#8217;m going to give this some more thought.</p>

                                <p>I think <a href="http://www.mydd.com/story/2004/11/3/175014/911">Chris Bowers</a> has it (almost) exactly right:</p>
<blockquote><p>The solution to our problems, the only solution that actually addresses our problems rather than criticizes us for not doing well at tasks where we actually excel, is to increase the number of liberals in this country at a more rapid pace than the number of conservatives are increasing. We must grow liberalism. </p>
<p>&#8230;We have to define liberalism according to positive semiotic frames. We have to be willing to take these frames to every corner of the nation, and run candidates in every single race in every single district (preparation for which begins today). We have to be willing to spend tens of millions of dollars not to win elections, not to help &#8220;worthy causes,&#8221; but simply to sell liberalism. </p>
<p>&#8230;Our growing activist strength was a sight to behold this time around, and I will write more about it in part two of this &#8220;memo.&#8221; However, in 2008, we could become even more active and do even better on the ground, but still lose because we have kept shrinking. We have to grow the left wing. We have to sell liberalism. We must crush conservatism itself. This will [not] be accomplished by activism alone. This will not be accomplished by &#8220;moving to the center.&#8221; In fact, this will not even be accomplished by the combination of the two. Instead, we can only win by moving the country itself to the left.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like the way the election turned out, then as far as I&#8217;m concerned, that should be your assignment for the next several years.</p>

                                <p>Sorry for this, but I have to get preachy one last time today.  The number of distraught calls, emails, and people visiting me today for consolation has taken me by surprise, I must admit.  People, tens of millions of people (no they haven&#8217;t all emailed me yet), are crushed by this election result in a way that is striking and probably unprecedented over the past 30 years – because they care passionately about this country and about making it a better place.  In a way, it’s good to see.</p>
<p>But don’t get too depressed.  At some point you need to gather yourself up and look forward.  So for those who need them, here are some thoughts to buoy your spirits:
<ul>
<li>The nation will survive, and recover from the Bush presidency.  This country has survived a lot of bad events and a lot of bad policy throughout its history.  We’ve already survived four years of more-or-less complete Republican control in Washington.  Nothing in that regard has changed with this election; now we just face a couple more years of the same.  If we could make it this far, we can make it the rest of the way.</p>
</li>
<li>Instead of Kerry taking the blame for Bush’s poor decisions, Bush will now reap what he has sown: tremendous fiscal problems, intractable problems in Iraq and the rest of the middle east, international ill-will, a brewing financial crisis, a weak economy, nuclear proliferation among foes of the US, non-state terrorist enemies who are strong and getting stronger…  And in four years, instead of Kerry being blamed for these problems, the blame will rightly go to the Republicans.
</li>
<li>Despite the conventional wisdom, I think that Bush is likely to be weaker in his second term than he was in his first.  Why?  First of all, because of a high probability of some serious <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0409.drum.html">scandals</a> in Bush’s second term.  Secondly, because his goals for a second term are likely to be far more ambitious and politically difficult to accomplish than his first-term goals were; reforming social security and overhauling the tax code are far more difficult to do than simply passing tax cuts.  Third, because Republican party discipline will increasingly fray as numerous Republicans have the incentive to compete for power with Bush as they consider political life after the lame-duck Bush.
</li>
<li>The expanding size of the Republican electorate that was evident in this election will further convince Republicans that they can win without appealing to moderates.  The party will continue to move right, leaving the center of the electorate increasingly open for Democratic candidates to appeal to.
</li>
<li>This loss will hopefully convince millions of people on the left that they need to become and remain politically active if they want things to change.  This will help to build the base needed to sustain a new left for more than just a single election.  In opposition, the left will continue to learn to focus, strengthen, shape the debate, and build the infrastructure necessary to reclaim the nation’s rhetoric and agenda.  As I wrote this morning, we’ve already made a good start in that direction; who would have thought a couple of years ago that a “liberal senator from Massachusetts” could win 46% of the vote in Missouri or 49% of the vote in Ohio?</li>
</ul>
<p>Believe me; I understand as well as anyone the potential hurtful and otherwise bad policies that are likely to happen with four more years of one-party Republican rule in Washington.  But there are silver linings to this election result.  So when you’re ready to do something to make this country better, realize that the world is not going to come to an end, that things will get better, and get to work.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Does Lawrence Kudlow just make stuff up or what?  Read <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200411031343.asp">his latest</a> on why the Evangelicals came out in large number for Bush yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who would have thought that lying exit polls, socially conservative Democrats, and Evangelical Christians would have dwarfed traditional issues like national security and economic prosperity on Election Day 2004&#8230;But in the end the evidence points to the Evangelicals as Bush’s primary engine of victory. It’s still a rumor, but if Team Kerry leaked phony exit-poll numbers they may have actually increased the Christian turnout, rather than depressing it. </p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow does not even tell us where this alleged rumor comes from and he provides no basis for the line “lying exit polls”.  But in his odd little way, he confirms what AB said earlier:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;voters showing up to vote against gay marriage &#8212; the four million evangelical voters oft-mentioned by Rove. Ignorance. Fear. Hate. Victory.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what truly amazes me is how Kudlow ends his explanation for Bush’s victory:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the Bush-led conservative majority keeps its promises on a strong defense, on spreading peace-inducing freedom and democracy around the world, on limited government and lower tax rates to promote economic growth at home, on the pro-consumer, pro-investor, ownership-society, reformist conservative agenda for Social Security, healthcare, and education, and on the social values of protecting the unborn and preserving traditional marriage, then the 2004 election outcome will represent a huge step in the right direction for this great country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Limited government?  Does Kudlow even know government spending has risen in the past four years – and not just defense spending?  So with less taxes and more consumption, we will have less investment and long-term growth – assuming the law of scarcity still exists.  But then the economics editor of the National Review does not believe in the law of scarcity, I guess.  As far as “reformist conservative agenda for Social Security, healthcare, and education”, it would have been nice if Kudlow told us what that agenda really was – since Bush never has articulated it honestly.  </p>
<p>It seems the next four years will likley be like the last four years – more lies from the National Review as it carries the water for this Administration.<br /></p>

                                <p>Numerous commenters (e.g. <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2004/11/index.html#004691">Matt Yglesias</a>) have remarked on the lack of a significant increase in youth turnout.  While turnout of the under-30 crowd increased somewhat, it was no different from the increase in turnout more generally.  We won&#8217;t know for sure for a little while, but at this point is seems that the substantial efforts of ACT, MoveOn, Rock the Vote, etc. to bring new voters to the polls had little effect.  Note that this fizzle is similar to the one illustrated by Howard Dean&#8217;s inability to bring out new primary voters during the Democratic primary.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m now a firm convert to the unfortunate wisdom contained in these words by democratic strategist James Carville: &#8220;You know what they call a candidate who&#8217;s counting on a lot of new voters? A loser.&#8221;  </p>

                                <p>Congratulations to the GOP for getting their vote out and winning what appears to be basically a clean election.  Of course, now you have to govern with no excuses that we Democrats are obstructing whatever your agenda may be.  </p>
<p>The pundits last night were wondering about the future of the Democratic Party and why we supposedly have lost the value debate.  Pardon me for asking this – but what values are they talking about?  </p>
<p>Personally, I’m a faithful Christian married to a lovely women who values tolerance of others.  Neither one of us would encourage abortions but neither would use the government to coerce choices nor discriminate against Andrew Sullivan because of his choices in life – even if we find a few of his op-eds rather objectionable.  And many Democrats share similar values and life styles to that of my wife and myself.    </p>
<p>So what values do those in the GOP think they have a monopoly over?  Is it fear-mongering, hate, or the dishonesty portrayed so often by supporters of Bush-Cheney?  But in my church, fear, hate, and dishonesty are not considered Christian values.  </p>
<p>No, we Democrats do not have a value deficit.  Rather, we have not been entirely effective in noting that the GOP’s incessant desire to spend more and tax less – aka deficit financing – is bad economic management.  But more on the future course of fiscal policy later.  </p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Via <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/">Amy Sullivan</a> and <a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com/">Andrew Sullivan</a> we get this garbage from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/bennett200411031109.asp">Bill Bennett</a>:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Ethics and moral values were ascendant last night &#8211; on voters minds, in Americans&#8217; hearts. To be sure, every anthropologist loves his own tribe, and I have long advocated a stronger tie between politics and the virtues. Last night it was evident that the American people agree… Having restored decency to the White House, President Bush now has a mandate to affect policy that will promote a more decent society, through both politics and law.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the ethically and morally Bill Bennett would wish to use “politics and law” to impose his sense of morality on the rest of us.  And these fellows talk about “limited government”!<br /></p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Over the coming days and weeks we&#8217;ll be hearing about lots and lots and lots of lessons (many of which will probably be contradictory) that each side should take from the election.  Here&#8217;s my first stab at one: forget the middle and go for your base.  In other words, Rove was right.  </p>
<p>If you take a look at how Ds, Rs, and independents voted yesterday (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/president/">CNN&#8217;s website</a> has a handy way of quickly seeing this), in state after state the same pattern emerges: roughly 5-10% of Republicans voted for Kerry, roughly 10-15% of Democrats voted for Bush, and in every state that I looked at, a significant majority of independents voted for Kerry.  Bush received the vote of just 40% of independents in PA, 41% of independents in FL, 40% of independents in OH, 45% of independents in WI, and 45% of independents in IA. Even in AZ Bush managed to capture the vote of only 46% of independents.</p>
<p>Yet Bush won most of these states because more Republicans turned out and because Republicans more consistently voted for Bush than Democrats did for Kerry.  The lesson?  If you lock up your base, you don&#8217;t need to worry much about independents. I expect both parties to pay much less attention to independents in coming years.</p>
