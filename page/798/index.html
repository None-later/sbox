                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Nouriel Roubini&#8217;s excellent blog touched upon a subject that is sure to become more prominent as time goes by: <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/213189">Soverign Wealth Funds.</a></p>
<p>While we may think that SWF&#8217;s are merely big piggy banks out to buy foreign assets (think China-Blackstone), they can also be national companies themselves. Implicit in Nouriel&#8217;s definition of SWF&#8217;s are publically owned companies such as CNOC and Dubai Ports. These are nationally owned companies, created, financed, and protected by governments.</p>
<p>Nourel states that SWF’s need to allow their currencies to float so that do not need to buy (or create?) such assets. Focusing merely on the currency issue may preclude us from seeing a deeper rationale for the need to purchase or create such as assets. Following are some possibilities:
<ol>
<li>SWF’s are national responses to privately own multinationals. For weak or small or developing countries, they provide the capital focus to accomplish what their own privately owned firms cannot. With such focus they can compete with the multinationals.</li>
<li>Some countries view capitalistic endeavors as an extension of national and political interests. China certainly fits this description, as does Russia. Just as all countries view their armies as a means of extending power, so these countries view their national companies as an extension of economic power.
<p>(As an aside, not all these countries have fixed currencies. Brazil’s Vale do Rio Doce, for example, just bought Inco in Sudbury, Ontario—a huge nickel mine. Vale do Rio is a publically own company; Brazil has a floating exchange rate.)</p>
</li>
<li>As the battle for resources intensifies, these companies will become pivotal in protecting national interests and needs, not private ones. Markets at that point may not function as western economists have been taught to expect. Some customers or buyers may be “more equal” than others.</li>
</ol>
<p>I see the growth of SWF’s as a natural response to America’s economic domination. Size and financial muscle are necessary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, not all countries share our vision of “private” ownership. And, yes, in the case of a number of public companies, CVRD, for example, foreign interests are allowed to own a share, a modest share. But, these companies are not for sale or takeover. They will remain national companies—unless they fail miserably.</p>
<p>Of course, pegged currencies are a means of subsidizing such companies. Laws limiting foreign ownership of more than a fractional share are a means of ensuring these companies serve national, not private, interests.</p>
<p>As they become larger and more influential players on the global stage, I see them as possible inheritors of our version of capitalism. Unlike our companies, these companies will directly serve national interests and goals.</p>

<blockquote><p>GENEVA (AP) &#8211; American workers stay longer in the office, at the factory or on the farm than their counterparts in Europe and most other rich nations, and they produce more per person over the year.  They also get more done per hour than everyone but the Norwegians, according to a U.N. report released Monday, which said the United States &#8220;leads the world in labor productivity.&#8221; The average U.S. worker produces $63,885 of wealth per year, more than their counterparts in all other countries, the International Labor Organization said in its report. Ireland comes in second at $55,986, followed by Luxembourg at $55,641, Belgium at $55,235 and France at $54,609.  The productivity figure is found by dividing the country&#8217;s gross domestic product by the number of people employed. The U.N. report is based on 2006 figures for many countries, or the most recent available. Only part of the U.S. productivity growth, which has outpaced that of many other developed economies, can be explained by the longer hours Americans are putting in, the ILO said. The U.S., according to the report, also beats all 27 nations in the European Union, Japan and Switzerland in the amount of wealth created per hour of work &#8211; a second key measure of productivity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Twice this story used “wealth” (a stock) when referring to GDP, which is income flows.  Shouldn’t those who report on economic matters know the distinction?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;For example, we know that in type 1 diabetes, metabolic control can reduce the risk of microvascular complications. On the other hand, the two largest randomized, placebo-controlled trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study and the University Group Diabetes Program, failed to find a significant reduction in cardiovascular events even with excellent glucose control.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#R2">2</a> Moreover, we are facing a troubling paradox: preliminary data that were presented at the meeting and published by Gerrits et al.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#R3">3</a> suggest that among the thiazolidinediones — a class of drugs that has been shown to improve metabolic control — rosiglitazone may increase cardiovascular risk whereas pioglitazone may reduce it. Until we have a better grasp of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes, it will be difficult to design therapies to prevent this complication or even to determine how the currently available agents that act at multiple sites may affect clinical outcomes in very different ways.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, glycemic control has been the centerpiece of therapeutic interventions in type 2 diabetes for many years. Within the past decade, several new drugs that result in &#8220;glycemic durability&#8221; — a reduction in the glycated hemoglobin level — have been approved by the FDA. However, change in the glycated hemoglobin level is a relatively poor surrogate for cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes, accounting for only 5 to 15% of the variation in ischemic risk.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#R2">2</a> This finding represents a major dilemma for practitioners, regulatory agencies, and patients who seek the newest and best treatments for this disease.<br />&#8230;</p>
<p>The controversy surrounding biochemical surrogates versus clinical outcomes was also highlighted at the FDA meeting when the advisory committee reviewed one of the largest randomized trials of rosiglitazone, A Diabetes Outcome Prevention Trial, or ADOPT. In that study, the percentage decrease in glycated hemoglobin was greater with rosiglitazone than with metformin or sulfonylureas, yet the risks of congestive heart failure and cardiovascular ischemia were higher.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#R4">4</a> These data suggest that we urgently need to change the regulatory pathway for drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes to make clinical outcomes, not surrogates, the primary end points. This is not a radical proposal: 20 years ago, the FDA shifted its primary efficacy end point for osteoporosis drugs from bone mineral density (a reasonable surrogate for the risk of fracture) to fractures themselves. Without a regulatory sea change with regard to diabetes drugs, we are certain to be in the same position 5 years from now that we are in now: we will again find ourselves in possession of a new wonder drug that is designed to treat a devastating chronic disease but that may do more harm than good.<br />&#8230; </p>
<p>Drugs are approved or removed from the market on the basis of evidence from randomized, controlled trials. In the FDA hearing on rosiglitazone, several meta-analyses (see <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#T1">Table 1</a>) revealed a significant increase in the risk of myocardial ischemic events among patients taking rosiglitazone. However, an interim analysis of the ongoing Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of Glycaemia in Diabetes (RECORD) trial, which was designed specifically to assess cardiovascular risk among patients receiving rosiglitazone, failed to demonstrate a similar risk.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#R5">5</a> In addition, two large observational studies, one conducted by Tricare for the Department of Defense and one conducted by WellPoint (the largest health insurer in the United States), noted no appreciable signal of increased cardiovascular risk with either of the available thiazolidinediones (see <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#T2">Table 2</a>). The contrasts among the levels of evidence and the results regarding the safety of rosiglitazone raised new questions about relative and absolute risks but also highlighted the weaknesses of observational studies examining events that are common and whose rates are likely to be increased only slightly by a given drug, even in a large cohort (such as that used by WellPoint, which comprised 160,000 patient records).<br />&#8230;</p>
<p>This issue led to an interesting sidelight at the meeting. Recently, there have been calls for the FDA to fund and oversee phase 4 postmarketing studies as a means of determining the safety of newly approved drugs. The two observational studies on thiazolidinediones whose results were presented at our meeting had been performed independently of the manufacturers and the FDA. The indeterminacy of their results, due to the inevitable effects of the many confounding variables inherent in such studies, illustrates why this approach alone will neither solve the overriding problems of drug safety nor ultimately help a chronically underfunded federal agency. There is no doubt that it will be costly to undertake true safety and efficacy studies of new drugs using clinical outcomes as primary measures, but in the long run, these efforts will save time, energy, and money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such reading is difficult for non-medical, but the thought is clear. The same theme is presented that proper testing is severely deficient and apt to get false negatives for safety as part of the design. It is unlikely that companies would furnish or finish appropriate testing for followup safety concerns that have NO longitudinal studies done. There is a growing share of the market that is tweaking current medications for the sake of patent production and sales but reveal little improvement in efficacy and actual concern of harm.</p>
<p>The gardasil vaccine is innovative and has been approved of course, but the immense pressure to get to market before a rival company predisposes companies to push increasingly more quickly and with greater &#8216;advertising&#8217; (a governor advocating mandatory vaccination!) that turns the market into a medical experiment of large proportion.</p>

                                <p>A big hat tip to AB reader Ken Melvin who reminds me I should read <a href="http://www.mahablog.com/2007/08/31/the-road-to-serfdom">Mahablog</a> more often.  In light if the clown show from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/turning-their-backs-on-nola.html">Kudlow</a>, we should all read what <a href="http://welcome-to-pottersville.blogspot.com/2007/08/paul-krugman-katrina-all-time.html">Paul Krugman</a> has to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, much of the Gulf Coast remains in ruins. Less than half the federal money set aside for rebuilding, as opposed to emergency relief, has actually been spent, in part because the Bush administration refused to waive the requirement that local governments put up matching funds for recovery projects — an impossible burden for communities whose tax bases have literally been washed away. On the other hand, generous investment tax breaks, supposedly designed to spur recovery in the disaster area, have been used to build luxury condominiums near the University of Alabama’s football stadium in Tuscaloosa, 200 miles inland.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tax-free enterprise zones – my arse.  This is something seriously wrong with this Administration and those National Review cheerleaders for this garbage</p>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NTdhN2QyM2JiYWQ4NTViMDRmNjhjNDI1ZDE3MzFiODA=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> has probably written even more pathetic op-eds over at the National Review, but I’m at a lost to remember anything as low as this: </p>
<blockquote><p>How much money has Uncle Sam spent on New Orleans and the Gulf region since Hurricane Katrina ripped the place apart?  I’ll give you the answer because you’ll never guess it. The grand total is $127 billion (including tax relief). That’s right: a monstrous $127 billion. Of course, not a single media story has highlighted this gargantuan government-spending figure. But that number came straight from the White House in a fact sheet subtitled, “The Federal Government Is Fulfilling Its Commitment to Help the People of the Gulf Coast Rebuild.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, the press has been covering this issue and reports that the other state in the Gulf region is being treated better than Louisiana.  But Kudlow can’t even begin to tell you that his statistic includes Mississippi.  </p>
<p>Kudlow wants his readers to believe that the fact that Louisiana is still not rebuilt despite the fact that PART of this $127 billion went to the state is a “quintessential failure of that liberal vision.  I guess Larry never figured out how much damage was done by Hurricane Katrina and the failure of the Bush Administration to act quickly.  No – Kudlow wants to attack the War on Poverty as he endorses the wonders of tax-free enterprise zones.  Incidentally, his <a href="http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=46294">own source</a> admits that the actual spending is far below this $127 billion: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Federal Government Has Provided More Than $114 Billion In Resources – $127 Billion Including Tax Relief – To The Gulf Region. Over $96 Billion Of The $114 Billion (84 Percent) Either Has Been Disbursed Or Is Available For States To Draw From.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the disaster in New Orleans were not so tragic, the stupidity and mendacity of Mr. Kudlow would be comical.  But is he pushing so new GOP agenda – which is usually his excuse for lying to his readers?  <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/052096.php">Steven Benen</a> is on this story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apparently, on the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina ravaging the Gulf Coast, conservatives have decided they&#8217;ve grown tired of the topic &#8230; That would be the same federal government, of course, that neglected the victims before the storm hit, as the storm hit, after the storm hit, and for the two subsequent years that followed. Indeed, for all the rhetoric we&#8217;ve heard, as of this week, &#8220;none of the 115 &#8216;critical priority projects&#8217; identified by city officials&#8221; for publicly funded rebuilding efforts &#8220;has been completed.&#8221; Of the $34 billion &#8220;earmarked for long-term rebuilding,&#8221; less than half &#8220;has made its way through federal checks and balances to reach municipal projects.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Whoops – a few facts Kudlow forgot to mention! Steve links to comments from <a href="http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/tancredo-slams-katrina-spending-2007-08-31.html">Tom Tancredo</a> and <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/JohnHawkins/2007/08/31/its_time_to_get_over_katrina_already?page=full&#038;comments=true">John Hawkins</a>.  There does seem to be an orchestrated effort to trash the victims of Hurricane Katrina.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>One test of truthiness of the change in Iraq is the left&#8217;s question whether there is any place in Iraq where a western foreigner can go without armor? Well, we have this from Martin Fletcher, an embedded London Times reporter in of all places Ramadi, Iraq, until recently the most dangerous city in the world &#8212; for westerners.<br />
<blockquote>In Ramadi last weekend I did things unthinkable almost anywhere else in this violent country. I walked through the main souk without body armour, talking to ordinary Iraqis. Late one evening I strolled into the brightly lit Jamiah district of the city with Lieutenant-Colonel Roger Turner, the tobacco-chewing US marine in charge of central Ramadi, to buy kebabs from an outdoor restaurant – “It’s safer than London or New York,” Colonel Turner assured me.</p></blockquote>
<p> Read the rest <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article2358061.ece">here.</a></p>
<p>It is a good memorial to an American hero.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Cactus here. Normally, I&#8217;d put my response in comments. But I guess this is in response to my comment the other day about reporters not being able to walk around unarmed and unescorted in Iraq, so I figure its OK if I put my 2 cents in given its a direct challenge. Its certainly a step toward proving me wrong&#8230; the reporter said he walked around with no body armor, and we can assume he was unarmed. Unescorted&#8230; not so much. </p>
<p>But let us say that this next step is achieved. So what we have in Ramadi is the Sunnis have now allied themselves with the US against Al Qaeda&#8230; but are there any Shia left in the city? Has the US allied itself with the folks who completely and totally ethnically cleansed their town, and who now see no need to stand with Al Qaeda because there are no Shia left to wipe out?</p>
<p>And perhaps we can achieve some semblance of peace in other areas by walling them off and <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/08/fallujah-pics.html#more">denying entry to anyone who doesn&#8217;t pass biometric tests</a>. </p>
<p>If the violence finally ebbs when most of Iraq has been turned into ethnically pure enclaves, do we really want to be in the position, a little way down the road, of being the enforcers of the conditions of this type of peace? Note that maintaining this sort of peace means keeping refugees and other survivors of ethnic cleansing from returning to their homes. It may be realpolitik, but I&#8217;m not sure I like the idea of American lives and treasure being spent protecting ethnic cleansers from the ethnic cleansees. I don&#8217;t remember that being one of the reasons GW gave for this little exercise in the first place.</p>

                                <p>If I understand the Bush mortgage bailout plan, it would bail out the mortgage companies and leave the homeowner with a new mortgage that may not be affordable anyway. Nice for the mortgage companies.</p>
<p>Please correct me if I have this wrong.</p>
<p>Case: I buy a house for $300,000 and finance $280,000. My rates adjust, I can’t afford the payments, and the FMV of the house falls to $240,000. I am in foreclosure.</p>
<p>Under the Bush plan I get a new $280,000 mortgage and the mortgage company walks scot free.</p>
<p>I have a counter-proposal.</p>
<p>The fed issues a new mortgage of 80% of the FMV and the mortgage company eats the difference. If the mortgage company doesn’t like the deal, the company can foreclose and eat the big one, so to speak.</p>
<p>Make any sense?</p>
<p>On other notes, what happens to the folks who already lost their homes during the Bush boom? Will the DOJ and/or the state AGs prosecute all of the fraud we are hearing about? Should the government stay out of this?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>AB readers – please indulge me for a moment.  Just imagine a situation where Tucker Carlson tried to make the moves on one <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/177719/aka_karate_girl">Chloe Bruce</a>.  Yes, this attractive young woman is quite the martial arts expert and it would be such a joy if she were so offended that she kicked the stuffing out of Mr. Carlson.  Something tells me, however, that Ms. Bruce would simply brush off the advance and not waste one second of her life with this bow tie twit. </p>
<p>I raise this only in light of <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200708290003?f=h_top">this interview</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>CARLSON: Let me &#8211; let me put it this way. Whether he&#8217;s gay or not actually is not our business, and I do think it&#8217;s indefensible that the newspaper in Idaho spent a year interviewing 300 people to answer the question, Is he gay? That&#8217;s none of your business. Having sex in a public men&#8217;s room is outrageous. It&#8217;s also really common. I&#8217;ve been bothered in men&#8217;s rooms. I think people who do &#8230; <br />ABRAMS: Tucker, what did you do, by the way? What did you do when he did that? We got to know.<br />CARLSON: I went back with someone I knew and grabbed the guy by the &#8211; you know, and grabbed him, and &#8211; and –<br />ABRAMS: And did what?<br />CARLSON: Hit him against the stall with his head, actually!<br />[laughter]<br />CARLSON: And then the cops came and arrested him. But let me say that I&#8217;m the least anti-gay right-winger you&#8217;ll ever meet <br />[laughter]</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s disgusting that this crew was laughing about the fact that the little coward known as Tucker Carlson went and found another person to help beat up the person who approached him in the restroom.  Assaulting another person is funny?  </p>
<p>But back to my hypothetical.  Why is it OK for guys to beat up on other guys for this stuff and yet it is considered manly when a guy decides to hit upon a woman.  Is it because the woman will not strike back?  </p>
<p>Come to think about it – some women would certainly have the ability to do so and any one of them wouldn’t need to go find any assistance.  <a href="http://www.cynthiarothrock.org/">Other</a> <a href="http://www.karatediva.com/">gals</a> <a href="http://www.usadojo.com/biographies/june-castro.htm">Tucker</a> <a href="http://www.debipurcell.com/">shouldn’t</a> <a href="http://dougchurchill.com/michele_krasnoo_directory.htm">hit</a> <a href="http://www.johnstutz.com/image.asp?fit_girls,shiva_bagheri,1">upon</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Gwadar port is on the Arabian Sea at the mouth of the Gulf through which 30% of the world&#8217;s daily oil supply passes.<br />Officials say the port will benefit Balochistan. That is disputed by Baloch militants fighting the government.<br />The current estimated cost of the port project is nearly $1bn. Much of the funding has come from China.<br />&#8230;</p>
<p>While inaugurating the port, President Musharraf described the occasion as &#8220;a historic moment&#8221; for Pakistan.<br />A high-level Chinese delegation, led by Minister for Communications Li Shenglin, was in attendance.<br />Gen Musharraf also announced that a modern airport would be built near the port with Chinese assistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same Chinese friends will build an airport here for us, where the best aircraft will come,&#8221; Musharraf said according to AFP news agency.<br />Gwadar is expected to provide strategic storage and transport facilities, as well as road and rail links to China.<br />The port is seen by observers as China&#8217;s first foothold in the Middle East.<br />&#8230; </p>
<p>China&#8217;s involvement has been viewed with hostility and suspicion not just in Pakistan, but also internationally.<br />The port is said to be part of Chinese naval expansion along the Asian and African coasts called the &#8216;string of pearls&#8217; initiative, according to a US Department of Defense report.<br />It entails the maintenance of ports and bases at strategic places in the region.<br />Observers say that United States as well as the Gulf countries have major reservations at the &#8216;overwhelming&#8217; Chinese involvement in the project.<br />The Gwadar port is situated right next to the strategic Straits of Hormuz and its busy oil shipping lanes.<br />The surrounding region is home to around two-thirds of the world&#8217;s oil reserves.<br />It is also on the shortest route to the oil rich Central Asian states through land-locked Afghanistan.</p>

<p>What do we learn from this? First, only three administrations – JFK/LBJ, Reagan, and GW increased the size of the active duty military… and GW did so by a smidge. Given Republican complaints about Clinton shrinking the military (and he sat in the middle of the pack in that regard), you’d think GW would have tried to increase the size of the active duty military quite a bit. Looks like at this rate, they’ll be able to continue criticizing Clinton for shrinking the military for administrations to come. (In fairness to GW, my guess is that the active duty military is now a much smaller part of the fighting force – all the two-weekend-a-month-folks doing 15 months in the Sandbox and stoplossed so they’ll do it again can attest to that, plus there are all the military contractors. The really big shrinkage in the military took place after the end of Vietnam, and in Ike’s term (i.e., after Korea). JFK/LBJ’s ramp-up makes sense – Vietnam was a proxy war against the Soviets. Reagan’s ramp-up… well, there was the Cold War posturing, the cutting and running in Beirut, and Grenada. </p>
<p>By the numbers, one would think GHW did a good job if you value the military. He managed to do a pretty successful job in Panama and defending our friendly despots in Kuwait against Saddam in Gulf War 1 while still shrinking the size of the military and cutting spending. Contrast that with GW… the biggest spending increases by far (twice Reagan’s, in fact, as a percentage of GDP). Clearly ill-defined badly-planned missions with tap-dancing goals are costly. That said, as a share of the budget (and of GDP), spending on the military is still much lower than in the tail end of WW2 &#038; Korea years.</p>
