<p>Putting People in Boxes – Pandora’s Solution is Grating My Nerves</p>
<p>Is a political “liberal” somebody who wants to play Robin Hood with other people’s money, or a “conservative” somebody who wants to stick his nose in your bedroom and listen to you whisper on your phone?  We have commercial businesses who sell beer through advertisements using talking frogs, and liqueurs through sultry dancing girls at a disco. </p>
<p>Labels, boxes, categories, &#8211; are these harmless shortcuts or are they obnoxious assumptions designed to produce conformity?  Our political parties and media pundits are happy with putting people in boxes, like the proverbial crippled Spanish-surname woman or the bible thumping black-hating redneck.  Whole campaigns are built around putting you in a box, or a political tribe, and appealing to your assumed prejudices. </p>
<p>I find it obnoxious, even if it works.  Since I’m closer to Democrats than Republicans this year, let me pick on the Democratic Party first.  I’m repelled by the ethnic and tribal categorization of Americans under the disguised battle cry of “multiculturalism” and “pluralistic politics.”  It’s Democrats who have introduced the idea of the “hyphenated American.”  African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, Irish-Americans, Jewish-Americans, working class-Americans, and so on and so on and so on.  This is one of the most divisive tactics that exists.  It splinters the very concept of the “united states” and the sense of a shared destiny and political ethos.</p>
<p>Republicans couch it a little differently, but aim to do the same thing.  Pro-life-Americans, never-surrender-Americans, patriotic-Americans, free-market-Americans, small-government-Americans.  And so on and so on.  These are terms that don’t merely describe, but which over time have trained Republicans and all Americans to have strong visceral reactions.  Competitors have been turned into enemies.  Old women spit out their hatred of “liberals” as they wait in doctors offices for treatments paid by Medicare.  I’ve heard them here in Tennessee.</p>
<p>After decades of constant efforts to splinter our society into “Us” or “Them”, and drive voters into unthinking tribal loyalty to one party or the other, is it any wonder that political debate has become a matter of irrational statements and slogans?  I have a theory.  My theory is that the fastest growing set of registered voters in the United States are listing themselves as Independent.  They’re sick of being taken for granted because of their color, or income, or gender, or religion, or for any other reason.  Otherwise why would John McCain and Barack Obama be such strong candidates this year?  They’re the two candidates who are LESS easily put into a standard box with the standard political labels slapped on them.</p>
<p>If you think that micro-targeting and micro-pandering to voters in the U.S. is a good idea, think about the other ethnic or religious tribal societies in the news today.  Afghanistan, Rwanda, Kenya, Iraq, Pakistan, Northern Ireland, Israel.  We keep on this same divisive path, we’ll have to take our machetes down to the polling place in November and chop our way into the voting booth.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>A little industry has arisen whose primary purpose is to throw gray dust into the facts surrounding global warming. I say &#8220;gray dust&#8221; purposively. It does not fool the thousands of scientists who are actually in the field, but it is enough to fool those with neither the time nor the ability to do any serious research.</p>
<p>Everyday, I read about these gnats; everyday I look at some of their stuff. In fact, I have a Google alert on climate change, a.k.a. global warming. The station survey is one of these gnats.</p>
<p>As I said in response to Co Rev&#8217;s piece, some adventurous souls are trying to diligently locate all the U.S. ground surface stations, especially those located near heat sinks.</p>
<p>Having lived in rural America&#8211;and Canada&#8211;, I know that if you tell one of the locals an anecdote about a temperature station being located on a tarmac or near an oven, he will delight in displaying his superior knowledge over all those high brow scientists. &#8220;Damn fools,&#8221; he will croak. &#8220;They couldn&#8217;t tell the difference between a tail and a teat.&#8221; He will be pleased with himself, of course.</p>
<p>He will also want to rant a bit about the government funding all those silly research projects. &#8220;Damn, who wants to know about bear genes, unless they plan on dating a bear.&#8221; Of course, politicians love those kind of quips. They play well. If a study does not put food on the table, it must be idiotic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those quips serve the purposes of the big boys&#8211;coal and oil and others&#8211;who have some serious money on the line. If I have learned anything from reading as ecletically as I have it is this: All things are connected. Study the ant you may understand how swarms function in nature&#8230;and maybe in economics. No politician would ever fund a study that examined the size of finch beaks over a period of time. Yet that study of the beaks of the Galapogos finch gave us profound insight into how populations evolve as resources change. All things are connected. Unless you truly understand the nature of the study and its purpose, hold your fire.</p>
<p>When I read the station survey, I noticed that it did not include the oceans, the polar regions, the other continents. It was just a map of the contiguous U.S. Hell, most Americans think all those other places totally irrelevant anyway. But they are busy in Utah and elsewhere hunting down the stations. And, of course, the myriad weather balloons are totally discounted; anything out in the ocean they can&#8217;t swim to. I didn&#8217;t have to think much. No wonder when I Googled &#8220;surface station survey&#8221; I came up with very few hits. (Be sure to enclose the phrase in quotation marks.)<br />I do have a simple question for these fellows to chaw on: Are we measuring the polar regions accurately? Scientists do claim that the poles, especially the Arctic, have warmed much faster than the temperate latitudes. (That they have makes sense even to me: After all, global heat will dispersed. Heat will move north and south, heating those areas more rapidly.)</p>
<p>There has also been some movement of the deserts north. Flora and fauna are on the move. How about doing some studies of these? Put these energetic folk to work.</p>
<p>And what about the Arctic ice melt? Must be volcanoes acting up&#8230;or maybe aliens have planted giant heaters. I would love to see the people who hunt for flawed stations move to the Arctic and do some serious looking for flawed stations there.</p>
<p>When these issues are raised, deniers have a number of fall back positions: It&#8217;s the sun; it&#8217;s the Milanovitch cycles (they really should look at that one more closely); it&#8217;s water vapor, its hidden volcanic activity; the weather is colder today or this year. (&#8220;Damn we had a bad winter&#8230;and they talk about global warming! Stupid, scientists. They would milk a bull. And the government pays these guys to do this stuff. Damn rip off, I say!&#8221;)</p>
<p>They&#8217;re penultimate fallback position is the geological record. They talk about the Pleistocene, the Little Warming, or the Cretaceous as if they were old buddies. That really loses most everyone, except those scientists that actually do the studies. Some actually try to hold their own with scientists. I have watched them overplay their hand time and time again in RealClimate.</p>
<p>Their ultimate defense is the small handful of scientists that try to hold the line against global warming, Pielke Sr. for example. He is reputable. But are the exchanges between him and his numerous colleagues on the other side ever reported? Nope. Have they read those exchanges. Hmmmmm that might be asking for too much, eh? They&#8217;ve picked their racehorse and will stay with him through thick and thin.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the real problem: Knowledge. Most of us, including me, have limited in-depth knowledge with which to seriously add to the discussion. Yup, I am a rube, too&#8211;a local yokel. I do read a mite more&#8211;but there is so much to absorb that I know I would never pass a introductory college exam in any of the pertinent fields. I cannot remember that much.</p>
<p>I try to follow what the Chinese are up to; try to understand monolines and subprimes; I keep watching the WTO; I look under the covers to understand the connection among lobbyists, the government, and the military.</p>
<p>I try to follow the peak oil debate, the water shortage debate, the gasification of coal debate. I try to understand glacier melt (Himalayan,for example) and resulting flooding then desertification.</p>
<p>I try understand fish farming and its effects on wild fish. I read studies on the nitty gritty of pollution or the depletion of biodiversity, studies on how how warming will affect habitat (is it doing so already?)&#8230;there is simply no end to it. What about the principles of exponential growth in terms of energy? In terms of population? In terms of available resources? What about the economic principles about which we talk so much? How much in-depth knowledge of everything must I have in order to claim to know anything more than the tiniest sliver of how the world functions?</p>
<p>Remembering everything I read I cannot do. I go too fast. What I try to do is to read and evaluate critically&#8211;gather into my brain some working principles, some things that strike me as profoundly logical or true.I forget the details. If the study makes sense, especially in terms of others I have read, something in me is reinforced, made stronger.</p>
<p>What I want is an informed opinion, even if I can not remember all the details that went into forming that opinion.</p>
<p>If I really have to, I will go back and fill in those details. But I am not going to do that for the local rube or farm boy. I am certainly not going to do it for anyone who is not willing to do a modicum of research.</p>
<p>At times I have to rely on my innate intelligence, as limited as that may be. For example, that the polar regions should warm faster than the temperate zones strikes me as eminently reasonable. They are doing just that .I have read no serious studies contradicting that central fact.</p>
<p>That ice everywhere would be the first to go strikes me again as eminently reasonable. Yes, there may be places where ice or snow may be accumulating&#8211;but the global direction seems clear: Ice is disappearing.</p>
<p>Yes, I would expect the Himalayas to melt. And yes they are melting. That we are overfishing the oceans strikes me as a sane comment&#8211;especially when I see the size of those oceanic factories and when I know the hunger the growing billions of us have.</p>
<p>Yes, we are not paying attention to the pollution we leave in our wakes. That I have seen with my own eyes as well as having read about it in serious studies. We seem to be crazy housekeepers, running madly around after the fact, trying to clean up messes we made ten years ago instead of thinking ahead and planning.</p>
<p>Yes, there is no really effective market place without transparency and some kind of regulations. Transparency and regulations are Siamese twins: One comes with the other. I watched the subprime fiasco, the Enron joke. Yup, the principle is correct. Let&#8217;s grant the principle and argue the details.</p>
<p>Yes, the principle of evolution is not debatable. I have read enough on that score. (Yup, I do think the creationists are idiots in their denial. I am not going to be silent for fear of offending their god or religion. If they kept their silliness to themselves, I would have no problem. But that is not their purpose. The fact that our President and many other politicians share their belief is a sad commentary on the state of science, to say nothing about the level of our political discourse.)</p>
<p>Yes, I do think Malthus was correct; the principle is correct; the timing is the issue.</p>
<p>Yes, China does have a game plan for industrialization. Yes, the SWF&#8217;s do play a role; so does the currency peg; so does the suppression of labor reform. All of it makes sense in terms of China&#8217;s timetable.</p>
<p>And so it goes. I try not to be a rube and think local. I try not to be parachoial or to allow my wishes or my friends or my religion or my political affiliations to color my conclusions. In the end, I hope I am on the right track.</p>
<p>When pressed, I will acknowledge that I know little, that like all of us, I struggle with the candle I have and the limited time I have to hold it.   In the final analysis, the difference between me and the other rubes is marginal indeed.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>CoRev sends a link to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080203/COMMENTARY/586773713/1012">this commentary</a> by Richard W. Rahn in the Washington Times.  The whole thing is a mess &#8211; what would you expect, it came out in the Washington Times?</p>
<p>Early on, Rahn states:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. economy performed very well during both the Clinton and Reagan years. In fact, total economic growth was almost identical, averaging about 4 percent per year, with Reagan edging out Mr. Clinton by less than 1 percentage point for the total eight-year period. (Note: all the data in the accompanying table and in this commentary are derived from official U.S. government sources.) Actually, Mr. Clinton partially adopted Reagan&#8217;s policies — remember his State of the Union address in which he said: &#8220;The era of big government is over&#8221; and where he partially reversed his 1993 tax increase by cutting the capital-gains tax in 1996.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, the accompanying table doesn&#8217;t appear on-line, so I went looking for the data.  I&#8217;m not sure what data he used, but I figure &#8220;economic growth&#8221; could mean the annualized change in GDP, real GDP, GDP per capita, or real GDP per capita.  The graph below shows the annualized change in these four series. </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R6ZxIDoR7YI/AAAAAAAAA-k/Ea5iBMVqPck/s1600-h/Economic+Growth,+Reagan+and+Clinton.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R6ZxIDoR7YI/AAAAAAAAA-k/Ea5iBMVqPck/s320/Economic+Growth,+Reagan+and+Clinton.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t for the life of me figure out what I can do to arrive at the conclusion that &#8220;total economic growth was almost identical, averaging about 4 percent per year, with Reagan edging out Mr. Clinton by less than 1 percentage point for the total eight-year period.&#8221;   What I can say is that Reagan produced faster nominal growth, Clinton did better if you take into account inflation.  But I&#8217;ve included the data, and links to the  Bureau of Economic Analysis websites from where I pulled the data, <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p_ax_fywYILh7FxfuhGZuBg">here</a>, made available through Google Docs.  Feel free to try it yourself. </p>
<p>Rahn goes on&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Employment growth was very strong during both the Reagan and Clinton years, but in terms of percentage change in the total number of jobs, Reagan beat out Mr. Clinton by 3 points. (Total jobs increased slightly more under Mr. Clinton, but the size of the work force and population was sufficiently larger to make his performance a bit less impressive than Reagan&#8217;s).</p></blockquote>
<p>I would note&#8230; if you look at the employment to population ratio, which I guess is the way to account for &#8220;size of the work force and population,&#8221; you find that yes, Reagan did marginally better than Clinton.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-employment-to.html">Carter did better than both of them</a> by this measure, and it wasn&#8217;t even close. </p>
<p>More from Rahn&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>It is important to note that despite the very big swings in marginal tax rates during the last quarter-century, federal tax revenues as a percentage of GDP have varied relatively little. This shows that people substantially change their behavior in response to changes in tax rates — which is bad news for those who hope to get more revenue from tax rate increases, and good news for those who favor tax rate cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, what it shows is what anyone who looks at <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175814,00.html">IRS data</a> knows &#8211; the percentage of your income you pay in taxes is not your marginal tax rate.  Nowhere close, in fact.  As the table shows, in 2000, total income tax as a percentage of personal income reached its highest point ever in the year 2000&#8230; at 11.6%. </p>
<blockquote><p>The irony for Mr. Clinton is that the data show that he almost certainly would have achieved an economy that outperformed Reagan if only he had not raised income tax rates in his first term. He was too much a prisoner of left-wing orthodoxy to follow the empirical evidence of Reagan&#8217;s success.</p></blockquote>
<p>One thing Rahn does not look is the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-national-debt.html">change in the national debt</a>.  Mr. Rahn apparently is unaware that government spending is a component of GDP.  This means that a president can boost GDP a lot&#8230; by borrowing huge sums and spending them.  But since incurring debt means taking on obligations to make interest and principal payments in the future, boosting growth this way is a way of increasing growth now at the expense of lower growth in the future.  </p>
<p>So&#8230; Reagan&#8217;s growth rates came at the expense of growth under GHW Bush, Clinton, GW Bush, and GW&#8217;s successor&#8230;  Think 30 year bonds, and think rolling them over.  (Of course, GHW and GW Bush also increased the debt so don&#8217;t cry for them.)  But that means that Rahn is right&#8230;  Clinton could have increased growth rates in the short run by pulling a Reagan&#8230; and imagine what growth rates would look like now.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=02&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=the_post_misreports_the_budget">Dean Baker</a> reads the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/02/AR2008020202042.html">Washington Post</a> and just wants to scream:</p>
<blockquote><p>Okay, lets&#8217; start at the beginning. You don&#8217;t have to be an &#8220;administration ally&#8221; to say that a budget deficit of $400 billion matters less in 2009 than a deficit of this size in 2004, you just have to be a believer in arithmetic. The economy will be almost 30 percent larger in 2009 than it was in 2004, which means that the same deficit in nominal terms is 30 percent less important, given the size of the economy. This adjustment is also necessary in accessing the &#8220;record&#8221; $412 billion deficit in 2004. This deficit was equal to 3.6 percent of GDP. It is dwarfed by the deficit in 1983, which was equal to 6.0 percent of GDP. In fact, the deficits were larger relative to GDP in all but three years between 1982 and 1993.</p></blockquote>
<p>At this point, I wanted to scream something about those Social Security surpluses but Dean anticipated part of what I was thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even adding in the money borrowed from Social Security, the deficit in 2004 would only come to 4.9 percent of GDP.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks Dean but we should note that the Social Security surplus for 2009 will likely be about $100 billion more than it was for 2004.  While the General Fund deficit was about $594 billion for 2004, it could be over $700 billion for 2009.  OK, that would represent an increase that is just under 20% as compared to the 30% increase in nominal GDP so Dean is still right: the General Fund deficit as a share of GDP for 2009 is likely to be less than it was in 2004.  But we are not exactly talking about fiscal responsibility either – even if you’ll hear otherwise from certain members of the Republican Party.</p>

                                <p>As regular readers know, I&#8217;m all in favor of market economies with only a slight bit of regulation &#8211; I think markets should be regulated just enough to prevent most negative externalities and fraud from occurring.  But I found the following juxtaposition by the Skeptical Optimist to be quite (unintentionally) funny.</p>
<p>Here he tells us about <a href="http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2008/02/bad-bug-in-micr.html">his recent experience using Excel</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sorry, I have to postpone the usual GDP and Employment analyses and charts.  I am dead in the water, because of a formatting bug in MS Office Excel 2008 for Mac. </p>
<p>Apparently, Microsoft did not test their new 2008 software on Excel models saved in the Excel 2004 format prior to releasing their new version.  I am now blind in all those analytical models until Microsoft fixes their goof and issues a software update.</p></blockquote>
<p>His next post, put up the following day, is just <a href="http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2008/02/fq0805-favorite.html">this quote from Alan Greenspan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no denying capitalism’s record. Market economies have succeeded over the centuries by thoroughly weeding out the inefficient and poorly equipped, and by granting rewards, to those who anticipate consumer demand and meet it with the most efficient use of labor and capital resources. Newer technologies increasingly drive this unforgiving capitalist process on a global scale. To the extent that governments &#8220;protect&#8221; portions of their populations from what they perceive as harsh competitive pressures, they achieve a lower overall material standard of living for their people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes he did.  He put up one post one day, and the other the next. So I&#8217;d like to comment a bit on that&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not that old, but I&#8217;ve used VisiCalc (I was too young to use it for anything useful), Lotus, and for the past quite a while, I&#8217;ve been using Excel.  Its the industry standard &#8211; there really isn&#8217;t much choice these days.  Now Excel does have some nice features.   But I use a version of Excel about a decade old.  I may be forced to upgrade soon &#8211; people I work with have a later version, and people they work with have later versions still.   The reason Microsoft gets rewarded for coming out with new versions of Excel that eventually get bought by the rest of us has nothing to do with anticipating consumer demand and meeting it efficiently.  There isn&#8217;t any demand for bugs and failures. </p>
<p>The reason Microsoft get rewarded is that there are enough people out there who will buy new versions products that turn out to be infested with bugs despite the fact that all the old versions were also infested with bugs when they came out and for quite a while afterwards.   Eventually, though, enough people who simply are incapable of learning have bought the new buggy product with its backward compatibility issues for a tipping point to be reached, at which point the rest of us have to buy it, bugs and all.  </p>
<p>So why does it reach this point?  Who are the early adapters of bugs and failures, these people who get pissed on time and time and again and keep coming back for more?  Worse, those people who insist on dragging the rest of us over for the same treatment?  They&#8217;re easy to identify &#8211; most of them are happy to tell you about how they get pissed on time and again and still come back for more, and they follow it up by telling you about how beautifully markets work.  Oh yeah&#8230; and most of them consider themselves to be skeptical.</p>

<p><a href="http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/ushcn-crn-qualityplot2.png"><img src="http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/ushcn-crn-qualityplot2.png" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://www.surfacestations.org/images/CRN-rating-482.png"><img src="http://www.surfacestations.org/images/CRN-rating-482.png" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Wow is an understatement!  Fully 87% of the US Historic Climatology Network (USHCN) can not maintain measurements consistently within 1 degree centigrade.  That&#8217;s a real data quality issue.  You can find the most recent survey results and their quality rankings at <a href="http://www.surfacestations.org/">surface stations survey. <br /></a></p>
<p>Tell me again how much the temperature has risen in the past century?  Can we use data from these stations to show even a reliable historical record?  Some questions?  Sure!  But not for the United Nations.  The United Nations can make predictions, and tell us what will happen, with ranges and probabilities:<br />
<blockquote>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said temperatures were probably going to increase by 1.8-4C (3.2-7.2F) by the end of the century.</p></blockquote>
<p>   From <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6321351.stm">here.</a></p>
<p>So, if we are confirming model results from ground station measurements of dubious quality, then what can we say of the quality of the model results?  Moreover, if over 56% of those ground stations are not consistent to within 5 degrees CENTIGRADE (9 degrees F), what can we expect from estimates using their data?  How can we even adjust their readings for quality?</p>
<p>Why ask the last question?  Because the group surveying the stations is a volunteer group.  One formed after it was realized that those so important ground stations had not been surveyed  for years, if ever.  What is even more important is that in the first few station surveys findings showed some absolutely horrible locations, conditions and resultant readings.</p>
<p>The stations are monitored and reported by the National Climatic Data Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  They have been their &#8220;Official&#8221; stations for over a century in many locations. </p>
<p>If you find it hard to believe that these stations could be in such poor locations/conditions, and no one ever questioned it, a sampling of the early findings of the survey can be found <a href="http://www.surfacestations.org/odd_sites.htmhttp://">here.</a>   No matter your feelings and understanding of Anthropogenic Global Warming, it is REALLY REALLY hard to deny the findings from this volunteer group.</p>
<p>Sometimes a little skepticism can be helpful.  I still don&#8217;t know the impact man has had on the global warming issue, but I do know that there are questions (in fact man questions) over the quality of the current findings.  If the findings are questioned, should we not question the recommendations derived from them?</p>

<p>My response&#8230;  we can throw out astronomy too because 150 years ago, astronomers, many of them amateurs, would make their observations from inside big cities like NY or London.  Nowadays, light pollution makes that impossible.  But you say &#8211; well, these days most telescopes are out in the middle of nowhere, and some are actually in orbit.  </p>
<p>Turns out climatology works the same way.  Satellites are able to spot big reductions in the ice over both the <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/09/060914-arctic-ice.html">North Pole</a> and the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/02/AR2006030201712.html">South Pole</a>.  And then there is the little matter of former ice floes becoming <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/04/AR2006110401173.html">shipping lanes</a>. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not qualified to have an opinion on global warming.  Perhaps the warming being observed is cyclical.  Perhaps not.  But it seems to me that insisting that everything that is observed is a fake because some of the measurements are poor while ignoring much better measurements that show the same thing makes no sense.  Especially when it comes from folks who still tell you that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">lower taxes produce faster growth</a> or that tax cuts <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/in-my-opinion-thomas-sowell-is-hack.html">raise revenues</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>the league is not protecting intellectual property, but want parishioners to go to bars instead of churches on Sunday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ms. Alter writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>One unlikely match-up Sunday pits two powerhouse opponents against each other: the National Football League and the Christian church.  On one side are church-sponsored Super Bowl parties with big-screen TVs, soft drinks and some soul-saving talk at halftime. On the other are NFL lawyers threatening to crack down on unauthorized use of the game. The league, which owns both the Super Bowl name and the broadcast, has restrictions that limit TV screens to 55 inches at public viewings, except at venues like bars and restaurants that regularly broadcast sporting events. Airing the game at events that promote a message, including a religious message, is forbidden.  Churches have long used the Super Bowl to draw newcomers and build fellowship among congregants.</p></blockquote>
<p>I did not know that churches even threw Super Bowl parties.  Good for them.  Not to pick on the Governor of Arkansas as he may have even that much interest in this game between the team from Boston and the team from New York but I’m sure he has an opinion over the NFL favoring drinking beer over worshipping God.  </p>
<p>I just learned that there is a bar on the Upper East Side of Manhattan called Brady’s that has renamed itself Eli’s (my mistake &#8211; the name will be Manning&#8217;s) for today only.  Now that’s getting into the spirit!  I’m torn on this game.  While I’d love to see the Patriots to eclipse that 1972 “perfect season” of the Miami Dolphins, my fellow New Yorkers are really getting into tonight’s game.  No offense to Governor Huckabee, but maybe I’ll watch the game from an NYC bar and at least pretend I’m cheering for the Giants.  I certainly be hoping for a close game.</p>

                                <p>It would seem that the Corner Kids have been basically ignoring the news that the reported employment per the payroll survey fell last month – except for <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjM5NzhlNzg3Njg3ZDc2NTAxY2VjMjQ5ZWIzZDE4Zjk=">Ramesh Ponnuru</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Seems to me that everyone is making too big a deal out of the January jobs report. My local paper&#8217;s top story was the estimate that the total number of jobs fell by 17,000. If that estimate is revised later, to look better, I&#8217;m guessing it won&#8217;t be the top story. And such a revision is very possible. We supposedly had a decline in the number of jobs in August &#8211; later erased after revisions. The December estimate has been revised upward by more than 60,000 jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>There you have it.  As long as the reported employment change is positive, all must be great.  During the second half of 2007, average employment growth was a mere 82 thousand per month.  I guess the nitwits at the National Review thought the labor market was roaring even as the employment to population ratio continued to fall.  </p>
<p>I really cannot believe Ponnuru is this stupid.  But I guess the operative assumption at the National Review that the readers are incredibly stupid still holds.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/02/federal-spending-mythology">Paul Krugman</a> certainly understands more about economics that John McCain does and he’s a whole lot better at looking at the raw data:</p>
<blockquote><p>One thing I’ve written about a number of times, but becomes especially worth emphasizing now that John McCain is the presumptive Republican nominee, is the myth of runaway federal spending under the Bush administration. McCain has said on a number of occasions that he doesn’t know much about economics &#8211;  although, straight-talker that he is, he has also denied having ever said such a thing. But one thing he thinks he knows is that the Bush administration has been spending like a drunken sailor. Has it?  Consider the actual record of spending. Never mind dollar figures, which grow because of inflation, population growth, and other normal factors. A better guide is spending as a percentage of GDP. And this has increased, from 18.5% in fiscal 2001 to 20% in fiscal 2007.  But where did that increase come from? Three words: defense, Medicare, Medicaid. That’s the whole story. Defense up from 3 to 4% of GDP; Medicare and Medicaid up from 3.4% to 4.6%, partially offset by increased payments for Part B and stuff. Aside from that, there’s been no major movement.  Behind these increases are the obvious things: the war McCain wants to fight for the next century, the general issue of excess cost growth in health care, and the prescription drug benefit. So the next time Mr. McCain or anyone else promises to rein in runaway spending, they should be asked which of these things they intend to reverse. Are they talking about pulling out of Iraq? Denying seniors the latest medical treatments? Canceling the drug benefit? If not, what are they talking about?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/02/the-myth-of-run.html">Mark Thoma</a> provides graphs of various Federal spending categories relative to GDP from 1962 to 2007 as well as from 2001 to 2007.   If the combination of defense, Medicare, and Medicaid rose by more than the increase in overall spending (as shares of GDP) – then the rest of the budget is not running away as McCain would have it.</p>
<p>Also note that the increase in the deficit has been larger than this increase in Federal spending as BEA reports that the tax revenue to GDP ratio, which was 20.9% in 2000, had declined to only 18.9% by 2006 (BEA has yet complete its accounting of tax revenue for 2007).  McCain wants us to believe that the Bush tax cuts led to more tax revenues.  But the facts say otherwise.</p>
<p>So what are to make of McCain’s misstatements?  Is he really this stupid?  If so, why should we elect him to be the next President of the United States?  Or is he as dishonest as George W. Bush and Dick Cheney?  After all, Bush-Cheney won in 2000 and in 2004 by lying to us.  If we as voters continue to be equally stupid as we were in the last two Presidential election, maybe the McCain strategy will work.</p>

He noted that not long ago, he was working on some technology that is considered so sensitive that he was not allowed (and is not allowed) to work on it offsite.  His company is now selling that technology, with the permission of our government, to China.  He is pretty disgusted about it.  </p>
<p>(Another small comment for those who live in that world&#8230; I wasn&#8217;t a party to that conversation, but I got the impression during another conversation I had with him a few years ago, that the project he was working on was the sort of thing that would have been funded either by a certain TLA based in Chantilly or another former TLA in Lackland.  Just a guess, mind you.)</p>
