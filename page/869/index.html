                                <p><a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/capitalcommerce/070409/the_capital_commerce_debate_ro.htm">James Pethokoukis</a> covers a discussion between Barry Ritholtz and Donald Luskin.  Luskin managed to say something both incredibly stupid and funny at the same time:</p>
<blockquote><p>The housing sector has been very weak. It&#8217;s been in decline for the last five quarters. In the most recently reported quarter, the fourth quarter of 2006, the decline reached its worst level so far &#8211; a decline of 19.8 percent on a quarter-over-quarter basis, annualized. Overall in that same quarter, real gross domestic product grew at a ho-hum 2.5 percent rate. But if it hadn&#8217;t been for the big drop in housing, real gross domestic product would have been up a whopping 3.7 percent. The same pattern happened in every quarter of 2006. Every single time, housing dragged overall growth down &#8211; while the rest of the economy turned in spectacular results.</p></blockquote>
<p>Taking out declining sectors and saying the economy sine those sectors is doing just great strikes me as really stupid.  But here is the funny part.  The average real GDP growth rate has averaged about 2.5% or as Luskin said was “ho-hum”.  Real GDP growth during the Clinton Administration averaged 3.7%, which Luskin said represented “spectacular results”. </p>
<p>Now for some insights from a real economist.  <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/bafflingly-weak-recovery.html">Kash</a> is surprised that the combination of expansionary fiscal policy and easy money has not produced a stronger <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/bafflingly-weak-recovery-part-2.html">recovery</a>.</p>

                                <p>What if…..</p>
<p>we solved global warming and then discovered it was not the threat we thought it was?</p>
<p>What would be gained, what would be lost?</p>
<p>There would be costs to many industries, and adjustments in consumer habits and lifestyles.</p>
<p>The payoff would likely be in better fuels and more efficient transportation. We might even grab the brass ring and make progress on hydrogen fuels.</p>
<p>Why do I ask? There is not a complete consensus on the issue, and even those convinced of the problem are not completely in agreement about the scope of the problem.</p>
<p>So what do we have to win or lose by assuming there is a problem and attacking it?</p>
<p>One of the issues is the proverbial “whose ox gets gored?” Do we focus on the auto industry, do we  mount a broader effort, do we attack this as a U.S. problem, do we try to lead, what do we do with those who lose economically due to our strategies, and what if a few make windfalls?  Do we buy into Kyoto?  Are we buying into a recession?</p>
<p>What do you all think?</p>

Oh wait, Genevieve Wood thinks the voters were hoping that this Congress would slash entitlements such as Social Security benefits.  Gee, I never realized that.  I also did not realize that cutting “nondefense discretionary spending” could so dramatically reduce the deficit.  After all, <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N#S3">BEA</a> tells me that total nondefense purchases were only 2.3% of GDP in 2006.  No one would be so stupid to buy this nonsense from Genevieve Wood!

                                <p>Bruce Bartlett on occasion has some very smart things to say.  But it seems he says only really stupid things when he writes for the <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MjcxNWFhZTBkYmM2NDE1N2E3ZTRmOTcwMTMwMTY1OWY=">National Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2005, the federal government took $2.4 trillion out of the pockets of the American people. To put this number into context, it is about the same as the size of the entire U.S. economy in 1959 in inflation-adjusted terms &#8230; Contrary to popular belief, the vast bulk of federal taxes are paid by the wealthy. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, in 2006, 53.7 percent of all federal income taxes were paid by those with incomes over $200,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>These were the highlights.  Real GDP was 4.1 times higher in 2005 than it was in 1959.  Part of this increase came from higher income per person and part of this came from an increase in population.  Comparing tax revenues in 2005 to real GDP in 1959 is not putting things in context.  </p>
<p>As we look at the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">BEA</a> for calendar year 2005 (see table 3.2), we see $2246.8 billion in total Federal revenue of which $855.3 billion came from contributions for government social insurance.  If the wealthy paid 53.7% of federal income taxes, that represented about 33% of total Federal taxes.  Since when is 33% considered the “vast bulk”?  </p>
<p>There is not a single contribution in Bruce’s NRO op-ed.  I guess had there been a legitimate contribution, Rich Lowry and Jonah Goldberg would have refused to let Bruce submit an op-ed.  But why does someone who is usually quite sensible need to write for a rag like the National Review?</p>

                                <p>Hoisted from comments, Brad deLong style.  Reader Cascadian write:</p>
<p>The way to stop abuses of undocumented workers is to document them, bring them into the light, and demand that employers give them the same rights as everyone else. That&#8217;s done by granting work visas to any immigrants capable and willing to work, indefinitely renewable absent criminal acts or other actions worthy of deportation, and not tied to a single employer. (That is, if an immigrant loses his job but his current work visa is still active, he can seek another job until his visa runs out.)</p>
<p>Without the ability to exploit these workers with threats of deportation, many of the economic advantages to employers of using them disappear. That also increases the competitiveness of citizen workers, who have many advantages over immigrants in the absence of exploitative practices. </p>
<p>In the case of economic redevelopment by government contract, as with Katrina, the policy should be to hire local unemployed and underemployed citizens to do the work, so that the money stays in the community that is being helped. To deal with structural unemployment in some communities of citizens (such as the African American community), the government should invest in public works projects that favor hiring of people in these communities. I&#8217;m partial to reinvestment in the national rail network, with workers hired locally along each line.</p>
<p>If the government actually took a proactive stance on unemployment, it could expose the current false choice of immigrant workers vs. low-wage citizen workers. It&#8217;s possible to provide opportunities for both, while also helping the overall economy.</p>

                                <p>Robert Rector has been peddling <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Welfare/sr12.cfm">this paper</a> to argue illegal immigration adds $400 billion per year to the deficits of the various U.S. governments (Federal, state, and local).  <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTUyZjY3NzExYjIxODU0NmVmYWE4MTAxNTZlOWJkNDk=">Byron York</a> gives this paper a favorable review.  I’m glad he did as his review inadvertently underscores what this Heritage analysis is misleading.  The title gives us the first clue:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fiscal Cost of Low-Skill Households to the U.S. Taxpayer</p></blockquote>
<p>York summarizes:</p>
<blockquote><p>He takes the most detailed look yet at the economics of the 17.7 million American households made up of people without a high-school degree &#8230; Against that, Rector found that low-skill households paid an average of $9,689 in taxes. (The biggest chunk of that was the Social Security tax — $2,509 — followed by state and local taxes, consumption taxes, property taxes, and federal income taxes, but Rector counted everything, including highway levies and lottery purchases.) In the final calculation, he found, the average low-skill household received $22,449 more in benefits than it paid in taxes</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice what this 17.7 million American households both includes and excludes.  It excludes immigrants who have decent to high incomes.  Immigrant households with decent to high incomes turn out to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits.  But more importantly, it includes much more than illegal immigrants as Rector has included not only legal immigrants but also American citizens.  If we someone tossed all illegal immigrants out the nation, we would not save $400 billion per year as Rector and York would have us believe.  Of course, the agenda of the Heritage Foundation and the National Review just might be to cut all poor people off from transfer payments.  I’m not sure if that’s true so let these two speak for themselves.  If they are not suggesting that governments should be so draconian, then this $400 billion figure is just stupid.  </p>
<p>Having grossly overstated the cost of illegal immigrants, York continues to pile with even more stupidity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rector excluded from that figure the cost of public goods and interest; with those included, he says, each low-skill household receives an average of $43,084.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is he kidding me?  Rector excludes the average cost of public goods as the marginal cost of letting one more person use a park is zero.  Not allowing illegal immigrants to live here would not materially reduce the cost of providing public goods.  York continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>At a cost of $22,449 per household per year — well, multiply that by an adult lifespan of 50 years and you have an average lifetime cost to the taxpayer of $1.1 million per unskilled worker. Increase that population with a wave of unskilled immigrants, and you’re talking a lot of money.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rector takes a snapshot and York wants to extrapolate this by assuming that a person with low income today will always have low income.  But wasn’t the whole argument behind those consumption inequality measures the premise that current income is not always a good proxy for lifetime income?</p>

                                <p>Since I had a post earlier today touching obliquely on the Iran Contra scandal, let me quote <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10463.html">Steve Benen</a> on an Iran Contra-ish activity by the current administration:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he Bush administration had specifically insisted that North Korea not be able to sell these arms, right up until U.S. officials decided the opposite.</p>
<p>The administration can’t sell arms to Ethiopia, in part because of trade restrictions, and it can’t let North Korea get money from arms deals, because of sanctions. But when push came to shove, the White House could allow both.</p>
<p>It sends an ideal message to any country facing trade sanctions — the United States means what it says, unless we find practical reasons to let secret arms deals go through. The sanctions we demand are apparently flexible — even after we implement them.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_04/011105.php">Kevin Drum</a> also has a post about Iran Contra-ish activity&#8230; it seems the administration may be funneling money to one terrorist organization (Jundullah) and providing military support to another (Mujahedeen-e-Khalq).</p>
<p>I can see the &#8220;thought process&#8221; now:  why leave the training and financing of terrorist organizations to the Pakistanis and Saudis when we can do it ourselves?</p>

<p>Let’s be honest – any debate over the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/unemployment-rate-clinton-v-bush43.html">unemployment rate</a> during the Clinton “boom” versus the Bush43 anemic recovery has to be goofy for several reasons.  First of all, the recovery from the Bush41 recession began during the second quarter of 1991.   Secondly, the fall in the labor force participation rate that followed the 2001 recession makes the unemployment rate a suspect measure of the health of the labor market.  For that reason, we have graphed the employment-population rate from January 1991 to March 2007.  The bottom during Bush41’s term was 61.2% and this occurred at the end of 1991.  The bottom during Bush43’s term was 62.1%, which occurred during July 2003.</p>
<p>Several simple lessons can be drawn from this.  One is that the labor market under Bush43 never got quite as bad as the labor market was in 1991.  Secondly, the labor market continued to deteriorate during 2002 and early 2003 even as real GDP slowly increased, which is why the Bush43 recovery was initially referred to as the jobless recovery.  But let’s go back to the recovery that started in 1991.  The employment-population ratio was only 61.4% as we entered 1993.  The anemic nature of the Bush41 recession was a major reason Clinton beat Bush41 during the 1992 election.  John Kerry tried to make the anemic nature of the Bush43 recovery an issue during the 2004 elections.  I guess the Karl Rove fear and smear tactics drowned out the message.  But if one compares what happened to the employment-population ratio during Clinton’s Administration to what happened to it under either the Bush41 or Bush43 Administrations, you’ll likely make a few wingnuts quite angry.</p>

                                <p>This is a continuation of my previous post on what to do to help out Michigan and Ohio. (or the rest of the nation for that matter). I suggested that there is plenty of money in this country, we just need to find a way to reduce a trend that has lead to the top 1% gaining a larger percentage. Currently at almost 22%, up from 8.8%. We have been living under the theory that high tax rates (personal or otherwise) have harmed the entrepreneurial spirit and thus harmed growth. We as a nation have prided our self on the free spirit industrialness of our character. We bragged about the small business being the engine of our economy. Jobs, jobs, jobs is the answer we&#8217;re told. But consider this by <a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1061&#038;context=iir">Harold L. Wilensky</a>, U of C , Berkeley, written in July of 1991:<br /><em><br />
<blockquote><em>“Not only is job creation unconnected to unemployment but it is<br />unrelated to economic performance generally. Take real GDP growth per capita<br />for 18 countries (exclude Israel):<br />In the pre-shock period, the more job creation, the less growth but the relationship is insignificant (r &#8211; -.14).<br />In 1974-79, the relationship is positive but insignificant (r = .33).<br />Only in 1980-84 is job creation significantly and positively related to real growth (r = .57); the more job creation the more growth. But in the three years after that the relationship disappears (r = -.07 for job creation 1985-87 and growth 1985-88).<br />Further evidence of the ambiguous meaning of job creation is the absence of any relationship to inflation (r = -.23 in the pre-shock period; r = .13 for 1975-79;r= .13 for 1980-84; r = .13 for 1985-88).<br />The statistical picture for 18 countries from 1965 to 1988 is consistent. There are no statistically significant correlations between job creation and the index of economic performance for any period.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p></em>Dr. Wilensky at the end of his paper writes: <em>If employment is expanded by the rapid creation of low-paid service jobs, an increasing number of them part-time or temporary jobs taken by people looking for fulltime work; a steady drop in real wages; and increases in the rate of family breakup (forcing single parents to work with grossly inadequate childcare arrangements), while productivity increases fade and international competitiveness and trade balances deteriorate, we can ask, &#8220;Is this progress?&#8221;<br /></em>He then goes on to predict based on the resultant low wages: <em>we incur all the costs of mass insecurity, industrial conflict, ungovernability, and unproductive welfare spending evident in my analysis of economic performance and party decline&#8230;<br /></em>And here we are in 2007!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the job issue. Concern about the types of jobs are always voiced when we discuss the numbers. I believe Cr. Wilensky has qualified that concern. We need to consider what we are creating. But, what about the actual creation that has gone on? Is there more entrepreneurial activity if we free up the money? We have allowed faster depreciation, cut corporate taxes and the top income tax rates along with capital gains tax. All things that effect the upper income earners. Using <a href="http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/saez/">Piketty and Saez </a>data which looks at the top 10% of income earners and then breaks out the subgroups within, I have graphed three groups: 90 to 95, 95 to 99 and 99 to 100. This posting is looking at each of the three groups make up of income. I will post each type of income in the next posting.</p>
<p>At AB we look at GDP over time and job growth as indicators of how well one time is doing compared to another. I did not think there was a need to post graphs of these, especially considering the above. But, we are trying to determine if all this freedom from taxes has benefited us. Is the money going back into the country in a manor that raises all boats? So, lets also look at capacity utilization (BEA does not go back further than 1967 for this number).<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RhuHehgw4gI/AAAAAAAAABU/mCspGb_OAfU/s1600-h/Capacity+Utilization+Graph.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RhuHehgw4gI/AAAAAAAAABU/mCspGb_OAfU/s320/Capacity+Utilization+Graph.JPG" border="0"></a> And Net Non-Residential Investment
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RhuHZxgw4fI/AAAAAAAAABM/gmq8DlEyNDY/s1600-h/Net+Non-Residential+Investment.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RhuHZxgw4fI/AAAAAAAAABM/gmq8DlEyNDY/s320/Net+Non-Residential+Investment.JPG" border="0"></a> And Export % Change
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RhuHWBgw4eI/AAAAAAAAABE/QtFEqPQhTdo/s1600-h/Export+%25+Change.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RhuHWBgw4eI/AAAAAAAAABE/QtFEqPQhTdo/s320/Export+%25+Change.JPG" border="0"></a><br />What follows are the 3 graphs of subfractions of the top 10%. The income for each group is:<br />90 to 95% $110,424<br />95 to 99% $176,925<br />99 to 100% $812,497<br />At 90% $96536, at 95% $130,373 at 99% $310,062.<br />It appears that the lower part of the top 10% is not much out of the range for what would be middle class had wages kept pace with GDP and productivity. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>     Note that each group is benefiting from rising wages and not so much from the passive incomes of interest, dividends and rents. Interestingly, interest income starts to decline after 1930 and doesn&#8217;t see a real bump until the 80&#8217;s ending in the mid 90&#8217;s. The largest increases in share of income from wages is the 95 to 100% crowd.  Rent&#8217;s and dividends just seem to be going down. But the real line to look at is entrepreneurial income (self-employment, small businesses, partnerships).  Is this what is referred to in the supply side theory/ownership society? Every time this line is going up, income from wages is going down.  Only the top 5% are showing any real initiative.  Yet, before the big crash, even the lower half of the top 10% had an increasing share of their income from personal initiative. Some say that the Clinton years were do to the luck of the computer age reaching a critical mass. When you look at the entrepreneurial lines, there appears good reason to believe so. The only other time when everyone was rushing to be an entrepreneur was WW2. Funny that we are in a “war footing” now and entrepreneurship is rising? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>     The first graph is what I would expect considering the income levels. Is not the middle class looked at as being the class who goes to work every day for the business owners?</div>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RhuHLRgw4dI/AAAAAAAAAA8/E9jgmTGBVqk/s1600-h/90+to+95+graph.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RhuHLRgw4dI/AAAAAAAAAA8/E9jgmTGBVqk/s320/90+to+95+graph.JPG" border="0"></a> </div>
<div>The second graph suggest that this is the level of income at which people will consider moving toward self sufficiency. What we would expect from our upper middle class?

<p>The third chart is where the big payday is. If the theory is correct would we see a somewhat similar curve in the rise of entrepreneurship as we see in wages? Is this what we would expect from the supply side, tax cutting crowd?

We sense that it is about quality of jobs and not quantity and have correlations from 1991 that suggest such. We seen a decline in capacity utilization over time, a peak in net non-residential investment that coincides with the computer age along with similar peaks in entrepreneurship. But, non of it shows the activity of WW2. And, none of it puts a dent in the fact that everyone is basically just going to work and earning a living. With these charts, the better the quality of the job, the better the income. I don&#8217;t think these charts support that we need to keep freeing up capital. They certainly do not bode well for the idea that everyone is independent and just needs to apply themselves to get be more financially secure. Instead it is more like that feeling that everyone just wants a “good” job that will allow them to have the American dream. A home, couple cars (used even), college for the kids, vacation and freedom from fear of financial ruin. The charts suggest to me that our economy needs a real, new to the human race event to spur growth via investments. Like say an industrial revolution, or a war or electronics revolution. Something where an existing core technology reaches a critical point in development that then creates a new sector of an economy. Something where there are no established players (think the failure of Tucker, DeLoraine, Bricklin, etc). I would say maybe energy could be the next biggy. Certainly anything related to environment; like getting rid of garbage.</p>

                                <p>I didn&#8217;t write anything about the Iranian seizure of British sailors and marines until now. Its an old game the Iranians play &#8211; think of the American embassy seizure in Teheran. And why not do it &#8211; there haven&#8217;t exactly been consequences for seizing the American embassy. Carter tried and failed to effect a rescue, and to this day its not exactly clear what the deal was between Reagan and the Iranians in 1980. (We do know there was a later deal involving missiles and a bible and a cake for the Ayatollah, but that doesn&#8217;t exactly qualify as punishment either &#8211; not for the Iranians and not for the Americans that were involved.) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, at one point, at least with respect to the Iranian activities of this kind, we (a broad we: Anglo-Americans) had something of a moral authority. But it gradually went away. I recall how the US violated international law by sending soldiers into the Nicaraguan embassy during the Panama invasion and trucked away whatever they found, just as an example. But my ambivalence to the story is best described by three <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/letters/la-le-tuesday10.3apr10,0,3858866.story?coll=la-news-comment-letters">letters to the editor in today&#8217;s LA Times</a>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Re &#8220;Freed British sailors say their confessions were coerced,&#8221; April 7</p>
<p>The British sailors captured by Iran say they were &#8220;put up against a wall, hands bound, blindfolded, and there were people cocking weapons in the background.&#8221; They were also kept in isolation for a few days and threatened with seven-year prison sentences. </p>
<p>American officials capture a large number of terrorism suspects, keep them in isolation for years, waterboard them, strip them naked, coerce confessions and never tell them when they will be freed. They are never charged or allowed to have a fair trial. I think I&#8217;d rather be captured by the Iranians any day.</p>
<p>MATT FARRELL</p>

<blockquote><p>The next time the U.S. government boasts about &#8220;confessions&#8221; made by detainees held at Guantanamo Bay for several years, remember the &#8220;confessions&#8221; made by the British sailors after only a few days in custody in Iran.</p>
<p>STEPHEN ROHDE</p>

<blockquote><p>There was a time when the Iranians&#8217; treatment of the captured British sailors would have caused American outrage. Now, thanks to President Bush, our response to tales of solitary confinement is, &#8220;What, no waterboarding?&#8221;</p>
