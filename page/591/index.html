                                <p>An article in <a href="http://www.wired.com/print/science/space/news/2008/07/NASA_next50">Wired</a> reminds us that space science can (and should) be relevant to terrestrial issues (*):<br />
<blockquote>There is a new challenge, however, that could ensure NASA remains relevant over its next 50 years: global environmental change, primarily human-induced global warming.</p>
<p>Jonathan Trent of the NASA Ames Green Team, a research group trying to bring NASA&#8217;s expertise to bear on energy and environmental problems on Earth, put it poetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the crew of a spaceship we don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; Ames [sic] said. &#8220;The radical technology we need is not just for us, but the life forms on Earth with us.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This seemed oddly familiar.  To the <s>way-back machine</s> NYT archives!<br />
<blockquote>WHEN President Bush outlined his vision of America&#8217;s future in space last week, Mars and the Moon outshone another initiative that the President said was critical to the space program: a 25-year effort using a new network of satellites to understand how the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, seas and living creatures function as a global system.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s President George H. W. Bush, and the <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DC173BF936A15754C0A96F948260">story</a> appeared on July 25, 1989.  This was called &#8220;Mission to Planet Earth&#8221; at the time, though in the Clinton era it became the <i>très</i>-New Democrat &#8220;Earth Science Enterprise&#8221; and what did those diabolical Clintonistas do?  Let&#8217;s jump ahead to <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E1DA163FF934A25751C0A96E958260&#038;sec=&#038;spon=&#038;pagewanted=print">1998</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The craft&#8217;s surveillance target is not some distant world, but rather the home planet of those who built it. AM-1 is to be the flagship of a new generation of earth satellites called the Earth Observing System, or EOS, which in turn is the centerpiece of what until recently has been called Mission to Planet Earth: a 15-year effort to subject the interlinked workings of the atmosphere, oceans and land surfaces to detailed scrutiny from space. </p></blockquote>
<p>It should be easy to guess at the gestational difficulties for the project:
</p>
<blockquote><p>As conceived at the start of the 1990&#8217;s, EOS was to consist of an elaborate array of six 15-ton satellites, each carrying 12 sensing instruments&#8230; to be launched over a 12-year period beginning in 1998. A complementary series of smaller satellites was to be sent into orbit starting somewhat earlier. The cost of the program, including operational expenses, was projected at $17 billion by 2000 and $30 billion by 2020. </p>
<p>But the project never found solid support. When Mr. Goldin became the NASA Administrator, he set out to make the space agency&#8217;s programs &#8221;smaller, cheaper, faster, better,&#8221; and EOS was a prime target of his intended reforms&#8230;</p>
<p>[T]he program came under attack from Congressional Republicans who charged that its purpose was to push a global-warming agenda. </p>
</p>
<p>EOS survived that challenge, but was redesigned in accordance with Mr. Goldin&#8217;s philosophy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then comes the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/15/AR2007011501049_pf.html">other George Bush</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The two-year study by the National Academy of Sciences, released yesterday, determined that NASA&#8217;s earth science budget has declined 30 percent since 2000. It stands to fall further as funding shifts to plans for a manned mission to the moon and Mars. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, meanwhile, has experienced enormous cost overruns and schedule delays with its premier weather and climate mission.</p>
<p>As a result, the panel said, the United States will not have the scientific information it needs in the years ahead to analyze severe storms and changes in Earth&#8217;s climate unless programs are restored and funding made available.</p>
<p>&#8220;NASA&#8217;s budget has taken a major hit at the same time that NOAA&#8217;s program has fallen off the rails,&#8221; said panel co-chairman Berrien Moore III of the University of New Hampshire. &#8220;This combination is very, very disturbing, and it&#8217;s coming at the very time that we need the information most.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all, it isn&#8217;t as if the Bush Administration has ever sought to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bush+administration+censor+climate+information">suppress politically inconvenient information</a>.</p>
<p>(*) Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with space science for its own sake.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The new game in town is &#8220;covered bonds,&#8221; Paulson&#8217;s latest attempt to rescue financial firms now mired in the toxic swamp they created. How exactly these bonds will work&#8211;and whether they will work&#8211;is a hot debate. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/jul2008/db20080729_334483.htm">Business Week</a> offers the following description of these new instruments:<br />
<blockquote>A covered bond is kind of bond back by mortgages.</p></blockquote>
<p>with the following provisions: Banks must hold onto the mortgages, paying the &#8220;bondholders out of their own cash flow, not from the proceeds of the mortgages.&#8221; Additionally,<br />
<blockquote>Covered bonds are considered safe investments because they must meet numerous standards. The loan-to-value ratio of the mortgages cannot exceed 80%, and borrowers must have documented income, according to the Treasury Dept.&#8217;s guidelines. In addition, no more than 20% of the underlying loans can be from one metropolitan area. </p></blockquote>
<p>The catch is:<br />
<blockquote>In lieu of a law spelling out the requirements of a covered bond, the Treasury and FDIC have issued guidelines. Banks can issue covered bonds with whatever specifications they want, but if they want the government&#8217;s stamp of approval—which they presumably will—they will stick to the guidelines.</p></blockquote>
<p>The devil is always in the details:
<ul>
<li>What counts as borrower documentation? </li>
<li>Why not a law governing requirements? </li>
<li>What kind of regulatory frame will be in place?</li>
</ul>
<p>Somehow, guidelines do not do it for me. I wonder why? Are we supposed to trust the bank specifications. Methinks the print will be very fine. And if a bank does indeed say it is following Treasury and FDIC guidelines, just how loose will those guidelines be?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1014335.shtml">Peter Morici</a> sees the initial problem as one of trust: Why should we trust banks when their compensation schemes encourage:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;bank executives to make risky bets that allow them to profit when things go well and to push the losses on bond and stockholders when things go sour. Upon taking over Merrill Lynch, John Thain increased executive bonuses, but established a risk management scheme. That hasn’t worked.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I would agree with Morici that it is becoming increasingly difficult to trust the fat cats who always seem to land in the honey even as they shed employees and turn to the government for help, would it not be wise&#8211;just once&#8211;to put some regulatory teeth&#8211;not guidelines&#8211;into the whole business?</p>
<p>Paulson continues to admire financial innovation, but so far those who pushed us over the edge have yet to pay a real price. CEO&#8217;s hiding behind &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; should be, by law, required to cough up a goodly portion of their own assets instead of sitting on their golden thrones, requiring the tax payer to foot the entire bill.</p>

<blockquote>Despite trade ministers&#8217; hopes for a last-minute deal, World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations collapsed yet again today, and observers at the talks in Geneva say that the failure is not surprising, given the reluctance of India and other developing nations to sacrifice food security measures in the wake of the recent global spike in food prices.</p>
<p>    Given President Bush&#8217;s lame duck status, negotiators had been called to Geneva to try to push through a last-minute deal before Bush left office. Because negotiators need about six months after a deal on the major issues to complete the details of the agreement, this possibility has now evaporated.</p>
<p>    &#8220;Given what&#8217;s been on the table, no deal is better than a bad deal. A Doha conclusion would have had major negative impacts for workers and farmers in developing countries. The tariff cuts demanded of developing countries would have caused massive job loss, and countries would have lost the ability to protect farmers from dumping, further impoverishing millions on the verge of survival,&#8221; said Deborah James, Director of International Programs for the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who has been observing the talks in Geneva. </p>

<blockquote><p>As Igor Volsky documents in the Wonk Room, McCain has gone back and forth a number of times on the issue of increasing the payroll tax. The truth is that lifting the current cap is the fairest way to help shore up the finances of Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed it is telling that John McCain has considered only increases in the payroll tax as he also endorses reductions in tax rates on capital income.  But hasn’t this always been the GOP agenda?  And even if these rightwingers get their way – no explicit tax rate increases combined with slashes in Social Security benefits – isn’t that a backdoor employment tax increases?  After all, we were told in 1983 that the increase in the payroll tax rate was supposed to help fund Social Security benefits for the future.  Little did we know – all this Reagan reform would eventually become is just the means for paying for all those reductions in capital income taxation.  Now that’s class warfare!</p>

                                <p>Remember all the Bush hoop-la about a new Middle East Peace initiative? Let&#8217;s see: There was a Two-State solution in 2003; the last was the Annapolis plan. Like the subprime bubble, they have been exposed as shams, conjured up by right-wingers in the U.S. and their rabid Lakud brothers in Israel. &#8220;How so,&#8221; you ask?</p>
<p>Consider the issue concerning the settlements. A a now-disclosed secret deal permits more settlements.</p>
<p>Last April, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/23/AR2008042303128_pf.html">Washington Post</a> ran a story about a letter between Bush and Sharon, giving the Israel permission to expand the West Bank settlements.</p>
<blockquote><p>A letter that President Bush personally delivered to then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon four years ago has emerged as a significant obstacle to the president&#8217;s efforts to forge a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians during his last year in office.<br />Ehud Olmert the current Israeli prime minister, said this week that Bush&#8217;s letter gave the Jewish state permission to expand the West Bank settlements that it hopes to retain in a final peace deal, even though Bush&#8217;s peace plan officially calls for a freeze of Israeli settlements across Palestinian territories on the West Bank. In an interview this week, Sharon&#8217;s chief of staff, Dov Weissglas, said Secretary of State Condolezza Rice reaffirmed this understanding in a secret agreement reached between Israel and the United States in the spring of 2005, just before Israel withdrew from Gaza.</p></blockquote>
<p>(The texts of the letters in question can be found <a href="http://www2.blogger.com/" listsrc="Y" subcontrassid="1&#038;sbSubContrassID=" itemno="415475&#038;contrassID=">here</a>.)</p>

It reinforces just how tightly wrapped Bush was around their fingers and makes it that much more difficult for Bush to bring into being that Palestinian state which he and Sharon worked so assiduously to prevent. A truly crafty, devious Machiavellian, Weissglas is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the rise of Likud&#8211;and the after the assassination of the great Yitzhak Rabin by a right-wing radical&#8211;, honest discussion about the Israeli-Palestinian issue has been all but impossible in the U.S. Indeed, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/25/AR2008072503490.html?hpid=topnews">right-wing American Jewish groups</a> have provided substantial monetary support for Likud&#8217;s efforts to stay in power. I would not doubt that these same groups provide similar support to some here, which is in itself not illegal. But it is always nice to know who is buttering whose toast. Eh, Leiberman?</p>
<p>For a full explantion of the kind of argument now swirling around Rice, Bush, Powell, and Israeli leaders, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/23/AR2008042303128.html?hpid=sec-world">Glen Kessler</a> of the Washington Post presents a good picture.</p>
<p>Would any presidential candidate actually address this problem, I wondered? Are they all now captive to Lakud spin? McCain certainly is. Is Obama?</p>
<p>Apparently, Obama has decided that Jerusalem will be the new Israeli capital. I thought that issue was still on the table. That tidbit was a pleasant sop tossed Lakud&#8217;s way. Needless to say, his remark caused quite a stir in the Arab world.</p>
<p>It certainly looks like Obama is cow-towing to the Likud hard-line lobby&#8211;at least on the issue of Jerusalem. (The <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2008/01/barack_obama_and_israel.html">American Thinker</a> has an interesting take on Obama&#8217;s Israeli bona fides. (For the <i>American Thinker</i>, unquestioning support of any Lakud policy is an absolute requirement.)</p>
<p>For a refreshing take on one presidential candidate&#8217;s take on the whole issue, try Nader&#8217;s<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23319215/page/2/">Nader:</a></p>
<p>
<blockquote>And I give you the example, the Palestinian-Israeli issue, which is a real off the table issue for the candidates. So don&#8217;t touch that, even though it&#8217;s central to our security and to, to the situation in the Middle East. He [Obama] was pro-Palestinian when he was in Illinois before he ran for the state Senate&#8230;. Now he&#8217;s, he&#8217;s supporting the Israeli destruction of the tiny section called Gaza with a million and a half people. He doesn&#8217;t have any sympathy for a civilian death ratio of about 300-to-1; 300 Palestinians to one Israeli. He&#8217;s not taking a leadership position in supporting the Israeli peace movement, which represents former Cabinet ministers, people in the Knesset, former generals, former security officials, in addition to mayors and leading intellectuals. One would think he would at least say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a hearing for the Israeli peace movement in the Congress,&#8221; so we don&#8217;t just have a monotone support of the Israeli government&#8217;s attitude toward the Palestinians and their illegal occupation of Palestine.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nader&#8217;s criticism of Obama may sound harsh; certainly Obama is not taking a leadership position in openly supporting the Israeli peace movement. Jerusalem will be the capital of Israel? Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?c=JPArticle&#038;cid=1203847465591&#038;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">handlers</a> did not like Nader&#8217;s reminding voters about Obama&#8217;s old positions:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Barack Obama&#8217;s longstanding support for Israel&#8217;s security is rooted in his belief that no civilians should have to live with the threat of terrorism,&#8221; the campaign statement said. &#8220;In Gaza, Hamas continues to fire rockets indiscriminately at Israeli civilians every day, and that&#8217;s why it is long past time that Hamas renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel&#8217;s right to exist and abides by past agreements.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>That kind of remark is standard no-think fare, a cover for Israeli brutality and duplicity. More and more, Nader seems to have a point. No mention is made of Israeli brutality&#8230;or of Israeli settlements. Who is noticing? Mention a new settlement, defenders of Israeli policies cite the standard line: Palestinians have to stop protesting, i.e., sending in rockets.</p>
<p>While Obama was not asked about the settlements, he certainly seemed to be toeing the official Israeli line&#8211;and the official line of our own right-wingers.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I read again <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/24/AR2008072403463.html?hpid=moreheadlines">that Israeli</a></p>
<blockquote><p>officials on Thursday revived plans to construct a new settlement in the occupied West Bank, two years after U.S. pressure forced Israel to shelve the idea. </p></blockquote>
<p>And, of course, pouring new Israelis into old settlements has not abated:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The new settlement would be the first in a decade and would contribute to a wave of building going on across the West Bank, as Israel adds thousands of new homes to existing settlements despite international calls to halt construction. An estimated 260,000 to 280,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank, not including those who live in parts of East Jerusalem that Israel has annexed, a move not recognized internationally.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting slant, especially when we consider that letter between Sharon and Bush four years ago. Doesn&#8217;t &#8220;Machiavellian charade&#8221; describe the whole &#8220;peace&#8221; process? And we wonder why the Palestinians and other Arabs do not trust us, and why, God forbid, they may actually hate us.</p>
<p>As Americans, we are all too willing to look the other way, to complain loudly at the insanity of suicide bombers, to acknowledge politely that the Wall does cause some inconvenience, and to tsk tsk when people throw rocks at tanks and expect not to get hurt. What, Rachel Corrie, a young American woman, protesting Israeli occupation in Gaza was crushed when she confronted an Israeli bullozer? Guess she should have know better. Officially, We studiously ignored her sacrifice. Ho hum.</p>
<p>Often Americans will simply throw up their hands, saying the whole thing is too circular: action-reaction: Violence begets violence. This kind of thinking Israeli right-wingers will indulge; it does not call into question their policies. It does not look at the tanks, the bulldozers, soldiers, and warplanes that move with impunity across Palestine. It does not look at the systematic and economic violence being done to an impoverished people.</p>
<p>Think about it: Three hundred Palestinians to one Israeli. Houses bulldozed; new settlements popping up, checkpoints established, roads controlled. Ask yourself: What if a Moslem country had the power to divide up America in this fashion. Would you, protest? Toss a few rockets? Maybe even, if despair seized you, tie a bomb to your waist and march forward? Take the analogy a bit further. Suppose Russia was the powerful arbiter of a presumed peace process between you and that Moslem country. And suppose you knew that Russia and that Moslem country were in cahoots. How would you feel about Russia? How would you feel about that Moslem country? Sorry, you don&#8217;t get any nukes with which to play.</p>
<p>This kind of analogy may seem extreme, but consider it a task for the imagination.</p>
<p>Now, again, there are more settlements. There has not been an honest peace process.</p>
<p>To Arabs, the Palestinian plight has been &#8220;our calling card&#8221; and their rallying cry.</p>
<p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is &#8220;central to our security.&#8221; Ignore it and we continue to radicalize other Arabs, with the possible result, of war&#8230;right where the oil is. Ignore it and we will continue to fret about our security, spending untold billions. Ignore it and we will continue to abandon our freedoms as we shudder in fear about the next attack. Ignore it and we risk our safety, our wealth, and our identity. We are better than this, fairer than this. Guantanamo is an extension of this conflict.</p>
<p>We risk everything in not demanding parties talk without preconditions&#8230;that means Israel must agree to talk with Hamas without preconditions. That means that all parties must obey the rules&#8230;and that includes Israel, especially Israel because it is demonstrably the more powerful of the two. Israeli power requires that Israel act with real restraint. No more settlements means not only <i>no more settlements</i>, but no settlements at all. Further, there can be no private and secret arrangements between the U.S. and Israel on the shape of things to come. If we cannot stand up to Lakud and the right-wing radicals in Israel, , we will give the radical Ben Ladens of the world more power.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, we are not Israelis, nor are we Palestinians. We are Americans: Our interest comes before Israel&#8217;s. Roll back all the settlements, now. No settlement should stand. All must go. We cannot allow each new settlement to be a new bargaining chip at the peace table. No debate here. Such an action is in our best interest. It will demonstrate that we are indeed honorable.</p>
<p>Thus the sting is drawn from the Ben Ladens of the world.</p>

<blockquote><p>I buy the basic Obama defense of his decision not to visit Landstuhl. I don&#8217;t think he was deliberately snubbing wounded troops. So I think the McCain ad is unfair, but it hits on a key vulnerability of Obama—the sense that he&#8217;s above-it-all and entirely too grand for his own good. I think Jay Cost pretty much nails it here. If Obama&#8217;s trip proves to have been a mild negative it will be because it reinforced this sense of him.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_07/014190.php">Kevin Drum</a> comments on Lowry:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shorter Lowry: Yeah, he was lying, but that just makes the ad even more awesome!  OK, now I&#8217;m being unfair. But considering how scurrilous this accusation was, couldn&#8217;t Lowry muster up just a slightly stronger condemnation than &#8220;but it makes a good point anyway&#8221;?</p></blockquote>
<p>But was it unfair for Kevin to suggest that Lowry endorses brazen dishonesty.  After all – the National Review routinely lies to its readers!</p>

Claiming the payments requires filing an income tax return, but some otherwise eligible individuals — notably seniors and disabled veterans — have total incomes too low to require filing a return under normal circumstances.  It&#8217;s hard not to think of low-income pensioners as having a high marginal utility of $600.  They have until October 15 to file.</p>
<p>Now, 5 million returns might not seem like a lot relative to the 134 million individual income tax returns filed in 2005 (the latest year in the Statistics of Income data).  However, according to IRS data graciously provided by the CBPP, it&#8217;s 28% of the population of Social Security and VA beneficiaries needing to file.  The geographical variations are pretty interesting, too:<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_dAYXCP-wxFE/SI9cijgMGfI/AAAAAAAAABE/xHkC2XChXfw/s1600-h/unfiled-stimulus.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_dAYXCP-wxFE/SI9cijgMGfI/AAAAAAAAABE/xHkC2XChXfw/s400/unfiled-stimulus.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>

<p>Somehow I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s easier to be on a low fixed income in the Northeast or West Coast states than it is in Iowa or South Dakota.  Perhaps it&#8217;s harder to reach the target population among the urban poor?  More outreach appears to be in order.</p>

                                <p>OSO writes from down under:</p>
<p><a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2008/07/monetary-policy-and-economic-shocks.html">Monetary Policy and Economic Shocks</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Poor Ben Bernanke. You gotta feel for the poor guy. Faced with a whole bunch of economic problems all occurring at once he took the only option that seemed to be open to him &#8211; which was to create more money and postpone the inevitable.</p>
<p>In my famous (at least famous to me) 2005 &#8220;Perfect Storm&#8221; prediction, I gave four reasons why the US economy was heading for disaster:</p>
<p>1) Higher oil prices caused by Peak Oil.<br />2) An asset price bubble in the housing market that will pop and devastate the housing market.<br />3) A high current account deficit caused by an overvalued US dollar that will eventually fall.<br />4) High levels of Federal government debt caused by budget deficits.</p>
<p>With all these shocks hitting the US at once, what could have been done in the last 12 months to soften the blow? Would there have been any fiscal or monetary policy that would have worked?</p>
<p>No &#8211; not in my opinion. Moreover there is no point trying to limit the damage because the tools at our disposal to limit the damage can&#8217;t handle the current crisis. We are in a crisis similar to that of the 1970s &#8211; whichever solution we choose the result will be bad.</p>
<p>One of the big problems with these four crises hitting now (and they will continue to hit for years to come) is that their effect upon monetary conditions is not uniform. Consider:</p>
<p>Peak Oil &#8211; inflationary<br />Housing Bubble &#8211; deflationary<br />US Dollar devaluation &#8211; inflationary<br />Public Debt &#8211; inflationary</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>If we were able to remove the housing bubble from the equation, then the solution to the crisis looks very much like raising interest rates &#8211; yet the housing bubble is very much the issue currently destroying wealth in the US. The other problems are certainly present, but their impact is not as strong. Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>Yet it might be tempting for people to argue that &#8220;well, if the housing bubble popping is deflationary, the surely the inflationary effects of high oil prices will actually help&#8221;.</p>
<p>But, as Milton Friedman told us, &#8220;Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.&#8221; If one economic shock causes inflation and another economic shock causes deflation, the fact that each cancels out the other&#8217;s monetary effects really means nothing &#8211; it just means the economy collapses without any inflationary or deflationary effects at all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to scour my mind for an image or an illustration that explains this. This is the only one that has come to mind:</p>
<p>Imagine you own a house on a flood plain. One day, your house catches on fire. At exactly the same moment, a massive rainstorm hits upriver and causes a flood. You look at your burning house and think &#8220;Thank goodness, some water to put the fire out&#8221;. But the flood is only one metre deep &#8211; enough to cause major damage to the bottom half of your house. Meanwhile the top half of your house burns away and no fire engine can get to you to put it out. So the top half of your house burns up while the bottom half rots away underwater.</p>
<p>The fact that the housing bubble is deflationary does not mean that inflation caused by high oil prices fixes it. After all, it is quite possible that house prices will fall greatly while everything else in an economy rises horribly. No, instead we have multiple shocks hitting the economy and no way of mitigating them. The property bubble popping may have flooded your house, but the high oil prices are burning up the roof.</p>
<p>Many econ-bloggers have firm opinions of what is going on. Mish argues for a deflationary hit and pooh-poohs the idea of a stagflationary environment. Not many others seem to adhere to an inflationary or stagflationary point of view. The deflationists (such as Mish and PGL at Angry Bear) argue for standard monetary and fiscal stimulation.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve spent time discussing the problem of monetary policy, I should also make a few points about fiscal policy and its limits. If the US government (under Congress and Bush) had actually been fiscally prudent since 2001, any fiscal stimulation plan would have some teeth to it. But since net public debt is now so high in the US (60% of GDP if I remember rightly), any attempt to run even larger deficits by the federal government will be met with even higher interest rates over the medium term, along with more current account blowouts which will shake even further the confidence that investors have in the US Dollar. That is why I have labelled &#8220;Public Debt&#8221; as having an inflationary effect earlier in this article.</p>
<p>Think back to the 1970s and the problems we had with inflation back then. Ian Macfarlane, the former governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, helpfully pointed out in a series of lectures that inflation was starting to be a problem far earlier than popularly thought. He pointed out that inflation became a problem in the mid 1960s and was not caused by the oil shocks that hit the world economy in the 1970s. This, of course, is meaningful, because it shows that inflationary pressures were being generated by an overheating world economy and were thus what we would identify now as a normal part of the business cycle (high growth, low unemployment, rising inflation). Of course, when the oil shocks hit, they destabilised most industrialised nations. By themselves they caused an economic downturn along with higher levels of unemployment. But, as all former lovers of the Phillips Curve lament, the inflationary effect of the shock confused policy makers in trying to work out the best solution. In the end, fifteen years of inflation and multiple recessions was brought to a very painful close by Volcker&#8217;s interest rate hammer.</p>
<p>As I pointed out back in 2005, the &#8220;Perfect Storm&#8221; which is now happening is likely to plunge America &#8211; and the world &#8211; into a protracted recession. There is a chance that this may be the worst economic downturn since the great depression. Yet I would argue that the problem will not be the quickly rising unemployment rates, nor quarterly GDP in minus figures, nor losses reported by corporations, nor plunging share prices &#8211; all those things will happen, but they happen in all recessions. What will typify this particular recession will be felt not now nor in the next 6-12 months but in the next 3-5 years. It will be felt in the rise of long term unemployed, it will be felt in stagnant GDP growth quarter after quarter, it will be felt in corporations releasing less than impressive balance sheets and in share prices sitting around doing nothing. It will, in the words of Paul Krugman, end up being an &#8220;L-ish&#8221; phenomena rather than a &#8220;V&#8221; shaped recovery.</p>
<p>With this before us, what can we do? Monetary and fiscal tools are pretty much powerless to stop the downturn or even limit it. Moreover, if Bernanke and Congress use them unwisely they may make things worse. In the end, therefore, the only thing I think is a viable solution is for monetary policy to be used simply to control inflation and not be concerned much with economic growth &#8211; which will, by ignoring it, be the best thing to help promote it. Using monetary policy to stimulate the economy because a recession is underway is no excuse when inflation is already too high. For fiscal policy the only real solution is to limit the deficit in the short term and erase it in the medium-long term. This won&#8217;t help now &#8211; but it will help to make things better later. This, of course, is counter-intuitive, but I would argue that to increase public debt when debt levels are already unsustainable will make things worse over the long run.</p></blockquote>
