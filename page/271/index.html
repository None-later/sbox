                                <p>I took a couple of days to let life interfere with blogging, but none of the standard politics/economics bloggers seems to have highlighted this note from the Lex column of last Wednesday’s (13 October 2010) FT (again, no link; feel free to provide in comments) under the heading “Defence M&#038;A”:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Lockheed has two small services businesses on the block. [These] in particular appear vulnerable as Robert Gates, secretary of defence, <em>looks for back-office savings to fund operational spending.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s pretty much a fair description of the reason for the existence of <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1469749" target="_blank">MERS</a>.* If there is an area of the U.S. economy that it <strike>is more corrupt</strike> has poorer incentive-alignment than FIRE, it is Defense Spending.  Mr. Gates’s willingness to encourage that by removing processing controls does not bode well for long-term budgetary value.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*Well, the other reason, after tax evasion.</p>

                                <p>When the question is asked whether the Obama Administration are fools or liars—and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MayorEmanuel" target="_blank">a certain Chicago mayoral candidate</a> is often nominated as both—you can be certain discussion of “the public option” will come up.</p>
<p>It doesn’t come up directly in today’s FT (page 4 of the print edition; no link; I get the paper edition, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/oct/17/newspaper-abcs-websites-internet-news" target="_blank">there’s no relationship between the two</a>*), but it certainly abides in the plan put forth by Paul Ryan (R-<a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/ryan-predictions/" target="_blank">Innumeracy</a>) to de-reform health care reform:</p>
<blockquote><p>Congressman Paul Ryan…says he believes an arcane budgetary procedure known as reconciliation could be a vital tool for his party to scale back funding for some of the administration’s policies. Under congressional rules, bills passed under reconciliation—which must be related to budgetary issues—need only 51 votes to pass in the Senate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s that self-same “arcane budgetary procedure ” that provided an opportunity to pass an initial health care reform bill with “<a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2010/02/22/landrieu-open-to-reconciliation-two-more-for-public-option/" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2009/09/25/howard-dean-reconciliation-will-cause-public-option-to-be-available-sooner/" target="_blank">public</a> <a href="http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2010/01/21/public-option-resurrected-from-near-death-thanks-to-special-election-reconciliation/" target="_blank">option</a>.” Strangely—feel free to Google for evidence—the Republican opposition to using reconciliation was varied and loud.  Now, it’s about to be their touchstone for dealing with health care budgeting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/05/public_option" target="_blank">Glenn Greenwald</a> and <a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2010/10/05/the-deal-with-the-hospital-industry-to-kill-the-public-option/" target="_blank">D-Day</a> have made the case that the Obama Administration were liars, not fools, when they declared they couldn’t pass the public option during the reconciliation process.  On the off chance we still believe they were only fools, it will be interesting—or, for some of us, horrifying—to see their reaction to an open declaration that the reconciliation process is fair game when used to reach Republican goals.</p>

                                <p>Industrial production is clearly slowing as total output and manufacturing output fell 0.2% in September&#8211; the difference between total and manufacturing output is utilities and mining and mining includes oil and gas production.  The slowdown was widespread as output of oil dirlling and the information technology sectors both fell.  About the only increase was an expansion of auto and light truck production from  7.75 to 7.84 million units. As the chart below shows after rebounding strongly in the early stage of the recovery industrial output is starting to closely followed the pattern displayed in weak recoveries.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TLx3Tj-j2mI/AAAAAAAABYQ/pa0X2ntz_XY/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TLx3Tj-j2mI/AAAAAAAABYQ/pa0X2ntz_XY/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>My estimate of monthly productivity growth in manufacturing is also weakening sharply as the smoothed year over growth has slowed to 3.4% versus a peak rate of 9.0% in January of this year.  Moreover, the smoothed three month growth rate and the unsmoothed monthly increase of only 0.1% in September implies that the slowing of productivity growth is not quickly reversing.  Weaker productivity growth is bad for profits growth that historically leads income and  employment growth.  Weak productivity could  imply that manufacturing employment growth was improving.  However, the index of  manufacturing aggregate hours worked peaked in May  at 78.0 as compared to its September reading of 77.3.  So on balance, prospects for continued manufacturing employment growth do not look encouraging.</p>

<p>Discouraging Greg Mankiw From Working Would be Good for the Economy, Part 2: <strong> Why the Correlation Between Top Marginal Rates and Real Economic Growth is Positive</strong>Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=200">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>I had a post the other day noting that the correlation between top marginal rates and real GDP per capita is positive.  Depending on how you look at it (i.e., growth over several years, growth over one year, going back to 1929, focusing only on the period since Reagan took office, etc) that correlation might be small or it might go above 50%, but it is positive.  That is to say, higher top marginal income tax rates have not caused with slower real economic growth in this country.   Not the message you&#8217;ll get from most economists, but the data says what the data says, and where economists disagree with the data, its a sign that something is seriously wrong with the profession, not the data.  (Note &#8211; the post appeared at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=195">Presimetrics blog</a> and at <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/10/discouraging-greg-mankiw-from-working.html#comments">Angry Bear</a>, and was in response to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/business/economy/10view.html?_r=1&#038;scp=1&#038;sq=greg%20mankiw&#038;st=cse">an op ed piece by Greg Mankiw</a> noting that higher marginal income tax rates would dissuade him from working.)</p>
<p>Now, in that post I didn&#8217;t explain why higher top marginal income tax rates haven&#8217;t reduced growth, and may have, at times, dare I say it, actually been a force for faster real economic growth.  So I&#8217;m going to cover that here.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>To start with, there is no question that if you tax someone&#8217;s efforts enough, they will reduce their efforts.  Any answer that is true will have to be consistent with both that statement and the facts (i.e., the positive correlation between top marginal income tax rates and real GDP per capita growth).  I can think of several such answers, and I believe all are true to some extent.   Now, before I lay out these answers, there is something I should note.  I&#8217;ve listed these answers in order, from more believable and less important to less believable and more important.  The reason I think most people will find the most relevant explanations most believable is that they don&#8217;t quite believe that pesky fact, that the correlation between top marginal income tax rates and real GDP per capita is positive.  With that warning, here goes:</p>
<p>1.  Top marginal tax rates are simply not high enough to induce people who pay it to reduce their efforts.   That&#8217;s an answer a number of bloggers (<a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/10/ego-or-money.html">Mark Thoma is a good example</a>) gave in response to Mankiw; raising the top marginal tax rate from 35% to 39.6% shouldn&#8217;t change Mankiw&#8217;s behavior much at all as the difference probably amounts to peanuts for Mankiw.  That may be true, but it does nothing to explain why growth rates were highest during periods when marginal tax rates were in the 70% range and up.  </p>
<p>2.  Dissuading people from putting in certain efforts doesn&#8217;t prevent others from putting in the same efforts.  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/10/greg-mankiws-anti-tax-arguments.html#more">Linda Beale</a> is one of several bloggers to note that others might happily step in to do Mankiw&#8217;s job should he choose.  I&#8217;m sure this is not what Linda Beale had in mind when she wrote it, but finding people willing to give policy advice that contradicts the known facts and results in sub-part growth shouldn&#8217;t be all that difficult, frankly.  </p>
<p>3.  Rising top marginal tax rates may dissuade some people from working, but generally won&#8217;t dissuade those doing productive work.  This is related to explanation 2, but it is subtly and importantly different.  Simply put, most people are easily replaceable.  Charles De Gaulle famously said &#8220;The cemeteries of the world are full of indispensable men.&#8221;  By that, I imagine he meant that in general, most people are easily replaceable. That holds even for folks who are deemed irreplaceable; I suspect if you replaced almost everyone working for the Fortune 100 or the Ivy League tomorrow, the change would be un-noticeable pretty quickly.  (An exception appears below.)  Now, there are some people that genuinely are irreplaceable, that genuinely do change things, but there aren&#8217;t many of these people, and beyond a certain point, they aren&#8217;t motivated by money.  Heck, most of them don&#8217;t end up all that wealthy despite being irreplaceable, and those few unique innovators that do accumulate vast fortunes (Steve Jobs would probably be an example) would happily do what they as long as they were making enough to meet some relatively basic needs.  The few people who can&#8217;t be replaced if they upped and quit because the big bad gubmint raised their taxes aren&#8217;t the sort of people to go Galt in the first place.</p>
<p>4.  A substantial percentage (and no, I don&#8217;t know what percentage that is) of people who are motivated enough by money that they might reduce their output in the face of even small changes to the top marginal rates are engaged in activities that are not good for society.  For example, they might be Harvard professors who peddle theories that are 180 degrees opposed to reality.  Or perhaps they develop or implement financial instruments that help bring down the world economy.  There is a bit of a self-selection bias at play; people who care enough about money to become <ital>homo universitus of chicagus</ital> are also the kind of people willing to generate massive negative externalities with nary a thought to the victims (except perhaps to call them &#8220;losers&#8221;).  Loss of their services is to be encouraged, not decried.</p>
<p>5.  At the margin, the gov&#8217;t can be more efficient with resources than many people whose needs are sated.  The primary motivation for such folks may be not risking what they accumulated and paying as little in taxes as possible.   The result, in many cases, is paying vast sums to accountants and keeping the money parked or hidden rather than in productive use.  </p>
<p>Anyhow, that&#8217;s what I came up.  Your thoughts?</p>

                                <p>by Dale Coberly<br />An Op-ed</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s no way out of here said the Joker to the Thief</strong> <br />&#8230; or is there? </p>
<p>This essay grew by strange turns from an argument I was having with another Bear, with whom I agree about all important things. </p>
<p>A long time ago I went with some civil rights workers to visit a migrant labor camp for sugar harvesters near Belleglade and Pahokee in way south Florida by the Everglades. </p>
<p>What I saw there left no doubt that these people were underpaid and treated badly, and that there was a dangerous level of race-based hate among the poor whites in the neighborhood. </p>
<p>But what we saw there could be understood in another way. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The farmer-supplied &#8220;rest rooms&#8221; were non functional and the sinks were filled with feces. </p>
<p>Almost all of the farmer-supplied &#8220;housing&#8221; was filthy with the filth of poverty. </p>
<p>But one young woman showed us her home, and it was cleaner and better kept than my own home. </p>
<p>So I wondered why ALL the houses could not at least be kept clean. And why the community rest rooms had to be so filthy. Even poor people ought to be able to manage public sanitation..even if its only a trench dug new each day and covered &#8220;as you go.&#8221; </p>
<p>And this is why I don&#8217;t think the answer to &#8220;poverty&#8221; is welfare checks alone. </p>
<p>What I think these people needed was someone to help organize the community to at least manage public sanitation, and negotiations with the farmer to maintain his own facilities in return for a reasonable level of care on the part of the tenants. </p>
<p>I think they needed someone to know enough about their lives to be able to, for example, help the woman who cleaned her house find a way to better her lot in life. </p>
<p>And they needed someone they could bring complaints of oppression and abuse&#8230; someone who would take them seriously and act on them. By negotiation if possible, by police action if needed. </p>
<p>Does any of this apply to &#8220;inner cities&#8221; or inner city schools? I think it does. &#8220;Liberals&#8221; cannot just throw tax transfers at people and expect magical results. Every community succeeds according to how well it is organized to meet the challenges it faces. The government&#8230; which has a critical interest in &#8220;solving&#8221; the poverty problem&#8230; needs to invest in community organization which will enable the people to solve their own problems&#8230; from repairing the schools, to monitoring how school taxes are spent. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is already being done. But I don&#8217;t hear about it, and I should if it is. If the big O was a &#8220;community organizer,&#8221; what did he organize? What did they achieve? </p>
<p>And, oh yes, what ARE they teaching in the schools nowadays?</p>

<blockquote><p>Request for original mortgage note and additional information</p>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>This is a qualified written request under Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).  I own the property at the address listed above, and your bank services my mortgage.  </p>
<p>Over the last several weeks there have been many stories documenting the problem that banks are foreclosing on homes without proof that they own the loan.  I have learned that in many cases, banks like yours do not even know who owns the loans you service.  Employees at several leading banks have admitted to rubber stamping tens of thousands of foreclosures every month, without even checking to make sure that the bank had a legal right to proceed with foreclosure.  In some cases, banks allegedly falsified mortgage documents to cover up their mistakes.  There have been reports of two banks trying to foreclose on the same home, banks foreclosing on homeowners who were current on their payments, and even of a bank foreclosing on a home where the homeowner had never taken out a mortgage to begin with.  This is not merely a &#8220;technical problem&#8221;&#8211;it is the difference between having a warm bed at night and being out on the street.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />To protect myself and my family, I need to know who owns my mortgage.  Within sixty days, I would like to know the name, address, and phone number of the bank or investor that owns my mortgage.  Furthermore, in light of the recent allegations of foreclosure fraud, I demand to see the original mortgage note proving ownership over my home loan.  If you fail to produce a mortgage note proving that you have a right to collect my mortgage payments, I will be forced to consider all options available to me to ensure that my family and my home are protected.</p>
<p>I ask that I receive my response in writing.  I understand that under Section 6 of RESPA you are legally required to acknowledge my request within twenty business days and must try to resolve the issue within sixty days.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also see Denninger&#8217;s piece on a an alternative to a general suspension of foreclsure activity, and a way to address concerns on proper &#8216;title to property&#8217; for any house owner.  Remember that while chances are small, there is at least one owner with NO mortgage who wound up in foreclosure proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care: Leave the gun, take the cannolis</strong></p>
<p>A few months ago I posted about the changing face of health care fraud, and especially about fraud committed by non-providers &#8211; such as non-existent durable medical equipment shops.</p>
<p>These groups often combine computer hacking, identity theft and bill-and-run phony front offices.</p>
<p>Today (13th) the federal government arrest 73 people charged with racketeering for creating more than 100 phony clinics in more than a dozen states and billing Medicare and Medicaid something like $163 million. The crooks, allegedly with an Armenian &#8220;godfather&#8221; in charge, stole the identities of both doctors and patients before blitzing the feds with phony billings from non-existent clinics. The &#8220;godfather&#8221; is in lockup today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the feds are auditing legitimate providers with contract auditors and cranking up requirements for compliance work. Maybe the feds should pay more attention to internal controls before paying crooks?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/10/14/us/politics/AP-US-Social-Security-No-COLA.html?_r=1&#038;hp" target="_blank">NYT reports</a> No Social Security Increase Next Year:</p>
<p><strong>One feeling reported was this</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I just hope there is some way to reconsider that decision (on the COLA) because it is going to affect so many people,&#8221; Edelman said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand why the Congress hasn&#8217;t seen that there&#8217;s been an increase in everything.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The explanation offered here</strong>:<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>More than 58 million retirees and disabled Americans will get no increase in Social Security benefits next year, the second year in a row without a raise.</p>
<p>The Social Security Administration said Friday inflation has been too low since the last increase in 2009 to warrant an increase for 2011. The announcement marks only the second year without an increase since automatic adjustments for inflation were adopted in 1975. The first year was this year.</p>
<p>The cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, are automatically set each year by an inflation measure that was adopted by Congress back in the 1970s.<br />&#8230;<br />A little more than 58.7 million retirees and disabled Americans receive Social Security or Supplemental Security Income. Social Security was the primary source of income for 64 percent of retirees who got benefits in 2008.</p>
<p>The average Social Security benefit: $1,072 a month.<br />&#8230;<br />The last increase in benefits came in 2009, when payments went up by 5.8 percent, the largest increase in 27 years. The big increase was caused by a sharp but short-lived spike in energy prices in 2008.</p>
<p>Gasoline prices topped $4 a gallon in the summer of 2008, jolting the inflation rate and resulting in the high COLA for 2009. When the price of gasoline subsequently fell below $2 a gallon, so did the overall inflation rate. Seniors, however, kept the high COLA for 2009. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The reality of how it is determined</strong> from <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2010/10/social-security-freeze.html" target="_blank">Econospeak and PGL</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There has been no recent decision by lawmakers to freeze nominal Social Security benefits. As our graph shows, the consumer price index for August 2010 is actually lower than it was in July 2008. So if CPI properly measures the cost of living – then seniors have received a slight increase in real income. Some prices may have increased while others have decreased. And perhaps food and utility for some seniors carry a higher weight in their own budgets than the typical consumer.<br />&#8230;<br />According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, energy prices have dropped dramatically over this period. It is true that the food price index has increased slightly. Over the same period, the housing price index has declined slightly. The medical price index, however, has increased by 6.8 percent. OK, seniors who budgets are heavily weighted towards the cost of medicine may have to make cutbacks.<br />&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to Econospeak reader <strong>JWMason who asks us to check the CPI-E</strong>, which is discussed here:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also calculates an experimental price index for Americans 62 years of age or older (often called the CPI-E). This article reviews price changes seen in the experimental CPI-E from December 1997 through December 2009 and reiterates the methods, sources of data, and limitations of the experimental index described in earlier articles. Over the 12-year period from December 1997 through December 2009, the experimental CPI-E rose 36.1 percent. This compares to increases of 33.9 and 33.8 percent for the CPI-U and CPI-W, respectively … The relative importance data for the CPI-E and the CPI-U and CPI-W populations show that older Americans devote a substantially larger share of their total budgets to medical care (see Table 1). In addition, for each population group, medical care prices rose more rapidly than the overall (all items) index during each of the eight years studied. For this reason, the medical care component accounts for a significant portion of the difference between the higher rate of increase measured for the CPI-E relative to the two official population groups during the 1998-2009 period … The CPI-E, reweighted to incorporate the spending patterns of older consumers, behaved more like the CPI-U than the CPI-W. This was expected, because the CPI-U includes the expenditures of all urban consumers, including those 62 years of age and over. The CPI-W, however, is limited to the spending patterns of wage-earner and clerical families and, therefore, specifically excludes the experience of families whose primary source of income is from retirement pensions. Finally, the medical care component of the CPI has a substantially larger relative weight in the experimental population compared to the CPI-U or CPI-W. As a result, the medical care component tends to have a larger effect on the elderly population than it does on the other two indexes. Other differences also play an important role, however, such as the greater weight of homeownership in the CPI-E.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our own <strong>Bruce Webb</strong> also leaves a comment at Econospeak:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The closing of the Medicare Part D donut hole via the ACA should have the effect of closing much of the gap between CPI-U and CPI-E. Or at least someone should run the numbers before we chase our tails arguing about indexes. Even if I believed CPI-E could possibly capture the true COL of seniors. My state and even my city offer a wide range of direct and discounted services to people over 55, something certainly not uniformly done across the country. But just about every place has something, even if it is as simple as the Early Bird Special at the local cafe. Trying to quantify for that and things like the variable opportunity costs for bargain shopping between current workers and retirees being pretty difficult, or so I would think.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which leads us back to where? Who, like reader CreativeGeneration on a different thread regarding proprietary trading and his lack of knowing, will grit their teeth to learn the outline of what is being discussed and try to find out? And does it matter to someone age 83 living on $1,029/month, or Greg Mankiw&#8217;s feelings on his extra $1000 and a marginal tax?</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/10/misleading-tax-and-spend-rhetoric-public-worker-overcompensation-and-too-high-pensions.html"><strong>Misleading tax and spend rhetoric&#8211;public worker &#8220;overcompensation&#8221; and &#8220;too-high pensions&#8221;</strong></a><br />crossposted with <strong>Ataxingmatter</strong></p>
<p>In <a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/10/the-cancer-of-distoring-tax-discussions.html">my earlier ataxingmatter post on how tax rhetoric is used in political campaigning and think tank propaganda</a>, I noted that our nation is threatened by an epidemic of misleading tax rhetoric.  The GOP for four decades has made tax cuts its primary (if not only) answer to every problem, as well as its first-choice tool to achieve their proclaimed goal of decreasing the size of government.  (I say &#8220;proclaimed&#8221; since they are notorious, when in office, of actually increasing the size of government by significant increments while cutting revenues through tax changes especially favorable to corporations and the wealthy.) </p>
<p>The advent of the tea party, sponsored in large part by groups run by GOP operatives such as Dick Armey and Karl Rove with lots of corporate funding, has obfuscated matters even further.  We are all familiar with the irony of tea partiers decrying government activities and federal taxes as evil while  chanting that the government should &#8220;stay out of&#8221; their federally administered and tax-funded Medicare benefits.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But one of the most noxious forms in which the anti-government, anti-tax screed has thrived is the anti-public servant rhetoric, which suggests that taxes are wasted when they pay decent wages to government employees, which seem to be uniformly assumed to be corrupt and lazy bums who do nothing to deserve their pay, and that pensions for public employees are just another form of welfare entitlements that should be cut in half so that taxes don&#8217;t need to be raised on wealthy constituents&#8211;whether in the form of the graduated income tax much needed in Michigan or allowing the Bush cuts for the rich to expire as the GOP scheduled them to do without enacting a new tax cut to duplicate them.</p>
<p>The problem with that rhetoric, as I noted in the last post, is at root a misrepresentation of the bargain between employer and employee.  Public employees by and large are paid less than they could be in private positions requiring similar competencies.  I pulled in about $300,000 my last year at a Wall Street law firm associate, but I left because I wanted to teach&#8211;at a significantly lower salary&#8211;at a public law school.  That story is repeated endlessly for public employees, whether at educational or research institutions, regulatory agencies, high or low level bureaucrats.  Part of the way that has been made possible is through collective bargaining&#8211;many public employees are unionized and have bargained for decent &#8211;not extravagant but decent&#8211;pension and health care benefits, in part to make up for the acceptance of lower salaries than they might earn in the private sector. </p>
<p>Yet the rhetoric continues, apparently because those on the right with a ready media voice (either as journalists or think tank operatives) have found that it triggers an expected negative response in the public at large that hears only the fact that government employees have decent pensions that have been underfunded and so will cost taxpayers now to fund them, and fails to hear the other side.  That side would include the relentless attack on workers and unions carried out by the likes of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers.  Unions are depicted as uberpowerful and a cause of all the problems that businesses face because of demanding too-high wages, when in fact the problem is the uberpowerful employers that have retained productivity gains for themselves and left workers&#8217; wages to stagnate or decline.  What the rhetoric about pensions and taxation glosses over is the fact that many private sector employers could and should have funded similarly decent pensions for their workers out of the substantial profits they&#8217;ve made from gains in worker productivity, but they didn&#8217;t do so.  Or that others promised to pay decent pensions and got workers to work for less salary than they would otherwise have done, and then through acquisitions and restructurings used the employer-friendly laws to renege on those promises and keep all the profits for managers and owners.  Or that the laws, beginning with Taft-Hartley labor &#8220;reform&#8221; and continuing with the refusal of Congress to let union formation have a level playing field (through the refusal to enact a card act, through allowing employers like Wal-Mart have unilateral access to workers to disseminate employer-friendly views about unions, etc.) have consistently weakened the ability of workers to form unions to fight for better pension and health care through the collective bargaining process.</p>
<p>For more on the issue of public sector employees and whether they are overpaid, and David Brooks&#8217; complaint that unions are to blame, see Mark Thoma&#8217;s excerpts from Dean Baker&#8217;s response, at <a target="_blank" href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/10/are-public-sector-workers-and-david-brooks-overpaid.html">Are Public Sector Workers and David Brooks Overpaid?</a>, Economist&#8217;s View, Oct. 14, 2010, which references John Schmitt, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/wage-penalty-state-local-gov-employees/">The Wage Penalty for State and Local Government Employees</a>, Center for Economic and Policy Research, May 2010 (noting that some conservatives blame public employee pay for the strain facing local government budgets, rather than acknowleding the recession and the lower tax revenues/higher social service needs that are the real cause).</p>
<p>Ultimately, the rhetoric around cutting public employee pension benefits and pay in order to cut taxes or continue existing tax policy benefitting taxpayers generally or the better-off especially is similar to the rhetoric around privatization of Social Security.  The argument is that some unworthy group is getting an &#8220;entitlement&#8221; at the cost of ordinary taxpayers, and that ordinary taxpayers should get angry over it and make sure that those people&#8217;s entitlements are cut before they are taxed another dime.  The problem with the argument, both in the case of Social Security and in the case of public employee pay and pensions, is that (i) those who receive the benefits have already paid for them and (ii) taxpayers should get angry instead at the politicians who constantly tell them that every problem can be solved by cutting taxes (especially for the rich) even more than already done.</p>
