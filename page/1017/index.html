                                <p>Given my call to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/cals-propositions-just-say-no.html">Just Say No</a> to ARNOLD’s propositions, the news reported by <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_11/007474.php">Kevin Drum</a> warms my heart that my state will not fall for the replacement governor’s spin.  But that’s only Propositions 74 to 77.  Proposition 73 is a call to the “right to life” (better put anti-choice) crowd to come help ARNOLD at the polls and will likely fail.  Proposition 78 reminds me of Bush’s Rx bill – and I’m not so sure about whether we are ready to really pay for the Proposition 79 alternative.  </p>
<p>Proposition 80 is another attempt by my state to regulate the provision of electricity.  Our last experiments with re-regulation have not worked so well so I was wondering if there was any wisdom on this new one.  <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/10/proposition_80.html">James Hamilton</a> comes through:<br />
<blockquote>California law AB 1890 forced the major California utilities to divest their fossil-fuel generating capacity, created the California Power Exchange to run wholesale auctions of electricity, and mandated a reduction in retail electricity prices. By 2000, California had reached a situation in which electrical generating capacity was close to demand on peak usage days. Because of the way in which wholesale prices were determined by the bids from power producers, in periods when there was the least spare capacity, it turned out to be in the financial interests of producers to have as much of their production off-line as possible in order to be able to sell at a nearly unlimited price. One of the key things that made this market manipulation possible was the fact that retail demand was by construction completely unresponsive to daily market conditions. Proposition 80 would repeal sections of AB 1890, and replace them with an outright ban on users making new arrangements to purchase electricity directly from producers. The proposition would further prohibit time-differentiated rate schedules for small users, unless the users give affirmative written consent.</p></blockquote>
<p>He continues as to why we should vote no on this proposal.  I’m convinced – it’s no on everything.  Now, I don’t know what makes me more angry.  That our replacement governor decided to waste our monies and time with these propositions – or that his minions are on TV with such brazen dishonesty trying to get us to vote yes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile – back to energy issues and my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/did-alex-rodriguez-reduce-ticket.html">latest post</a>.  My Tamny should visit the blog of <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/10/oil_company_pro.html">James Hamilton</a> before opining on oil profits.  I certainly intend to.</p>

<blockquote>To the media, it doesn&#8217;t matter that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence says Wilson lied about what he did and with whom he met while investigating Iraqi attempts to purchase &#8220;yellowcake&#8221; uranium. To the media, it doesn&#8217;t matter that the CIA says what Wilson did actually find supported that Iraq was attempting to buy the uranium &#8211; a direct contradiction to Wilson&#8217;s public claims. To the media, it doesn&#8217;t matter that he claimed the vice president assigned him to the uranium investigation when we all know now it was his wife.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do these seem like the same old excuses we’ve heard for over two years?  Well read on and see what Miller wants to do to alleged traitors like Valerie Plame.  Miller’s rant is based on the usual pack of lies from the rightwing apologists for Libby, Rove, and perhaps other partisan hacks in the White House.  No – Mr. Wilson did not lie.  It is the apologists for this White House who are lying.</p>
<p>But even if Mr. Wilson did say something that was not 100% accurate.  It doesn’t matter.  What Libby, Rove, and et al. did is inexcusable.  </p>
<p>Shame on the Atlanta Journal &#038; Constitution for even running this op-ed.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Today the BLS released its preliminary estimates of third quarter <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/prod2.nr0.htm">productivity and worker compensation</a>.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Productivity increased 4.8 percent in the business sector, as output grew 4.3 percent and hours declined 0.4 percent.  The 4.1-percent rise in nonfarm business productivity occurred as output rose 4.2 percent and hours rose 0.1 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>These productivity numbers are good; after all, it&#8217;s impossible to generate sustained increases in living standards without greater productivity.  However, the compensation that workers earned did not fare so well: real compensation actually fell for the second quarter in a row.</p>
<p>This is both good and bad.  Real compensation growth that is below productivity growth means that unit labor costs fell during the quarter.  That&#8217;s good news for the US&#8217;s inflation prospects; if unit labor costs were rising, the pressures on inflation would rise as well.</p>
<p>But obviously, this is bad in terms of income and demand.  If the compensation that workers are earning is not rising in real terms, then it will be hard for spending to rise, which in turn could spell trouble for the economy, as I mentioned in a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/slowing-growth.html">previous post</a>.</p>
<p>The following chart shows the trends in these variables over the past several years.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/prod_comp2.jpg"></p>
<p>One unfortunate feature of the labor market since the recession of 2001 is that workers have seen their compensation lag behind the increased productivity that they have generated.  This is somewhat unusual; over the past 50 years, the link between productivity and compensation has been pretty good, and deviations between the two have rarely lasted for long.  Last year it appeared that compensation was finally starting to catch up a bit to higher productivity, but now it turns out that that was only a temporary improvement; over the past year productivity is up 2.9%, while real compensation only grew by 1.9%.</p>
<p>To me, this suggests that the labor market is still quite weak.  And while good news on the inflation front, that could spell trouble for economic growth.</p>

                                <p>Iraq&#8217;s government has decided to reverse a decision made by the Bush administration that was by all accounts a disastrous mistake.  From today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/03/international/worldspecial/03iraq.html?hp&#038;ex=1131080400&#038;en=12731b9569603e0c&#038;ei=5094&#038;partner=homepage">NYTimes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>BAGHDAD, Iraq, Nov. 2 &#8211; The Iraqi government called Wednesday for the return of junior officers from the disbanded army of Saddam Hussein, openly reversing an American directive issued in 2003. </p>
<p>&#8230;Many American commanders and military analysts have said the dissolution of the 400,000-member Iraqi Army in May 2003 drove many thousands of Sunni Arab soldiers and officers into the insurgency while depriving the country of a force that could help restore order. American and Iraqi officials now say a core part of the Sunni-led insurgency is made up of former members of Mr. Hussein&#8217;s military.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, perhaps this admission and attempted rectification of a major Bush administration mistake will make it easier for Bush to answer the following question, posed to him during a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/04/20040413-20.html">press conference</a> in April 2004:<br />
<blockquote>QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. In the last campaign, you were asked a question about the biggest mistake you&#8217;d made in your life, and you used to like to joke that it was trading Sammy Sosa. You&#8217;ve looked back before 9/11 for what mistakes might have been made. After 9/11, what would your biggest mistake be, would you say, and what lessons have you learned from it? </p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: [Hmmm&#8230;] I wish you would have given me this written question ahead of time, so I could plan for it.</p>
<p>[Uhhh&#8230;] John, I&#8217;m sure historians will look back and say, gosh, he could have done it better this way, or that way. [Uhhh&#8230;] You know, I just [uhhh&#8230;.] &#8212; I&#8217;m sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to come up with an answer, but it hadn&#8217;t yet. </p>
<p>&#8230;[General musings on how all of his major decisions have been right, not wrong.]</p>
<p>I hope I &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to sound like I&#8217;ve made no mistakes. I&#8217;m confident I have. I just haven&#8217;t &#8212; you just put me under the spot here, and maybe I&#8217;m not as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or if he can&#8217;t answer that one, maybe now he can answer this question, posed to him during one of the <a href="http://www.debates.org/pages/trans2004c.html">Presidential debates</a> last year:<br />
<blockquote>LINDA GRABEL: President Bush, during the last four years, you have made thousands of decisions that have affected millions of lives. Please give three instances in which you came to realize you had made a wrong decision, and what you did to correct it. Thank you.</p>
<p>BUSH: I have made a lot of decisions, and some of them little, like appointments to boards you never heard of, and some of them big. </p>
<p>&#8230;[General musings on how all of his major decisions have been right, not wrong.]</p>
<p>Now, you asked what mistakes. I made some mistakes in appointing people, but I&#8217;m not going to name them. I don&#8217;t want to hurt their feelings on national TV.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>On second thought, perhaps this news from Iraq doesn&#8217;t help Bush to answer Ms. Grabel&#8217;s question.  After all, it is clearly the Iraqi government that has realized that Bush made a wrong decision, and it is clearly the Iraqi government that is taking steps to correct the mistake.  So Bush may still be as stuck as ever when asked if he&#8217;s ever made any mistakes as president.  Of course, we&#8217;ll have to wait until someone actually asks him this question again before we know for sure&#8230;</p>
<p>On a side note: it&#8217;s interesting to reflect on the fact that the only mistake that Bush has ever admitted to, albeit in very unspecific terms, is that he may have occasionally appointed the wrong people&#8230;</p>

                                <p>One of my favorite details in the reporting about the closed-door session of the Senate that Harry Reid called yesterday was this one from the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051102/ap_on_go_co/senate_iraq;_ylt=AmEmjy3KTeV_n6__16aOc3ys0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3OXIzMDMzBHNlYwM3MDM-">AP version</a> of the story: &#8220;[Lott] said Reid&#8217;s move violated the Senate&#8217;s tradition of courtesy and consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>It actually made me laugh out loud when I read that Lott was complaining that Reid was violating a tradition of courtesy in the Senate.  One of the defining features of the current Republican majority is that it has demonstrated a great willingness to revoke traditional practice, and has ignored courtesy and consent whenever it has suited them.  </p>
<p>For example, in the past four years the Republicans have ended the following practices:
<ul>
<li>The traditional courtesy that a home-state senator of a judicial nominee could put a hold on the nomination;</li>
<li>The tradition of anonymous floor holds on judicial appointments; </li>
<li>The traditional courtesy that at least one minority-party member of the Judiciary Committee should agree to move a nominee out of committee;</li>
<li>The traditional courtesy of allowing the minority party to request information about the progress of a Senate investigation, such as the one into the failures of pre-war Iraq intelligence;</li>
<li>The traditional courtesy that the President discusses Supreme Court nominations with the minority-party leadership before making a nomination.</li>
<li>And last but not least, of course, the Republican majority has made it clear that they are perfectly willing to change long-standing Senate rules regarding the filibuster, if the use of the filibuster by the minority party is inconvenient to them. </li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that this is just a partial list, by the way; feel free to add more.</p>
<p>Given this, I can&#8217;t say that I feel the slightest bit sorry for the Republican majority in the Senate for Harry Reid&#8217;s bold procedural move.  Most importantly, though, the move resulted in the Republicans agreeing to take some concrete steps toward investigating the intelligence failures that led the country into war.  Knowing more about what happened regarding pre-war intelligence can only be a good thing; it&#8217;s a shame that Republicans have been so reluctant to help increase our understanding.</p>
<p>As usual, however, for the best reaction to this maneuver see Giblet&#8217;s outrage on <a href="http://fafblog.blogspot.com/2005/11/stunt-stunt-stunt-stunty-mcstunt.html">Fafblog</a>.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Almost five years ago, the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/columns/stark_jayson/940014.html">Texas Rangers</a> offered one player about $25 million per year over ten years.  Some might claim that these contracts increase the price of tickets, but I’d rather suggest that it is our demand for the sport that creates economic rent for quality players.  OK, A-rod plays for the Yankees now and I’ve never been much of a fan of their team.  </p>
<p>The reason that I raise economic rents is the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200511010853.asp">John Tamny</a>: <br />
<blockquote>But ExxonMobil’s profits, and the rise in its stock price since oil hit a low of $10 in 1998, indicates very clearly that the markets are aggressively solving the existing oil shortage through the reallocation of investment toward the oil industry. To stifle or tax earnings would be to distort the process by which expensive oil will in time become cheaper. Back in 1980, in the midst of the last era of expensive oil, oil companies represented 28 percent of the S&#038;P 500’s value. This investment boom stimulated exploration and led to an oil “glut” in the 1980s and ’90s. In this new environment, cheaper oil and lower oil-company profits meant that investment moved elsewhere, and with this asset redeployment, oil-company share of the S&#038;P 500 fell to 7 percent. </p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, no.  There is a large difference between oil prices and the cost of producing oil, which is called economic rent.  Large rents do not create more oil in the Middle East.  And much of the swings in oil prices come from changes in the demand schedule – not outward movements along a very inelastic supply schedule.  But won’t very high oil prices encourage more exploration.  Tamny points to one example:<br />
<blockquote>Also, record profits attract imitators and innovators. Canadian oil company Suncor Energy is an example of innovation at work. It has devised a way to extract crude from oil sands, and the consensus is that this process will greatly expand the amount of proven reserves around the world. Happily, investors have rewarded Suncor; its stock is up 400 percent over the last five years, a timeframe in which the Dow has been flat while the S&#038;P 500 and Nasdaq have been down. </p></blockquote>
<p>Suncor Energy’s 40-F filing notes that it for, acquire, develop, produce and market crude oil and natural gas, transport and refine crude oil and market petroleum and petrochemical products. Its Project Millennium doubled its capacity to approximately 225 thousand barrels of oil per day.  Its proved and probable reserves of oil fell from 1.83 billion barrels to around 1.79 billion as extraction of oil reduced the estimated amount the company had in its oil sands mining reserves.  Certainly high oil prices induce companies with high production costs to start providing oil when the price rises above production costs and creates economic rent.

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>During his press conference last week, I thought I heard Patrick Fitzgerald says “It’s Not Over” in reference to his investigation.  Did I only imagine the word “not”?  It seems some on the right must have heard him declare “It’s Over”.  At least, many of the talking heads on the Sunday talk shows seemed to believe that the only indictments that will ever come out of PlameGate were the five perjury and obstruction of justice charges levied against Scooter Libby.</p>
<p>Case in point was Senator Lindsey Graham on Face the Nation declaring there was almost no possibility that Karl Rove would be indicted.  Another case in point comes from those guardians of justice and national security at the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/editorial/editors200510281820.asp">National Review</a>: <br />
<blockquote>This long-hyped, two-year investigation appears to come down, in other words, to one man&#8217;s alleged dishonesty when investigators came knocking. This is not Watergate or Iran-Contra, but neither is it a trifle … We don&#8217;t know all the facts and until we do, his acts are open to dueling interpretations. It seemed unfair for him to talk at his press conference of Libby damaging national security by revealing classified information, when Libby wasn&#8217;t charged with that … Two years later, we still don&#8217;t know important facts. Was Plame covert? Fitzgerald can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t say. Who is “Official A” (although we can all guess)? Who were the other unnamed officials?</p></blockquote>
<p>Excuse me for saying this but this op-ed is all over the map and ripe with contradictions.  Number one, the op-ed seems to say all that went wrong was that someone lied about something not particularly important.  But what did Libby lie about and what was he covering up?  And yes we do know that Ms. Plame was covert at the time – even if Cliff May keeps saying otherwise.  As far as the other officials, the indictment seems to be spending a lot of ink on the role of the Office of the Vice President in the smearing of Ambassador Wilson.  </p>
<p>Consider the information about the role of the Office of the Vice President presented by <a href="http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2005/1030nj1.htm">Murray Waas and Paul Singer</a> to the assertions of fact in the indictment from Fitzgerald.  It strikes me that the Special Prosecutor was laying much more than a case for perjury and obstruction of justice.  </p>
<p>As far as the identity of Mr. A, check out what <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/31/AR2005103101494.html?sub=AR">this story</a> has to say about Karl Rove:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fitzgerald appeared prepared to indict Rove heading into last week for making false statements, according to three people close to the probe. But that changed during a private meeting last Tuesday between Fitzgerald and Rove&#8217;s attorney, Robert Luskin. It&#8217;s not clear precisely what happened in that meeting, but two sources briefed on it said Luskin discussed new information that gave Fitzgerald &#8220;pause.&#8221; That evening, Fitzgerald&#8217;s investigative team called Adam Levine, a member of the White House communications team at the time of the leak. An investigator questioned Levine about an e-mail Rove had sent Levine on July 11, 2003 &#8212; the same day Rove discussed Plame with Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper, according to Dan French, Levine&#8217;s attorney. The e-mail, which did not mention Plame, ended with Rove telling Levine to come see him. The investigator wanted details of that conversation, which took place within an hour or so of the Cooper-Rove chat, according to a person familiar with the situation. Levine told investigators they did not discuss Plame. Part of Rove&#8217;s defense has been that he was very busy man who simply forgot to tell investigators about his conversation with Cooper. If the e-mail &#8220;was exculpatory at all, it was most likely a small piece of a much larger mosaic of information,&#8221; French said. A source familiar with the discussion between Rove and Fitzgerald said the Tuesday meeting was about a lot more than &#8220;just an e-mail from Levine.&#8221; He would not elaborate. Rove remains a focus of the CIA leak probe. He has told friends it is possible he still will be indicted for providing false statements to the grand jury. &#8220;Everyone thinks it is over for Karl and they are wrong,&#8221; a source close to Rove said. The strategist&#8217;s legal and political advisers &#8220;by no means think the part of the investigation concerning Karl is closed.&#8221; Cooper&#8217;s attorney, Dick Sauber, said Fitzgerald certainly meant it when he told Luskin last week that Rove remains in legal jeopardy and under investigation. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me knowing how careful he is and how much he doesn&#8217;t want to be seen as trigger-happy, that he is going through each of those things [that Rove presented] and seeing if they can be verified or not,&#8221; Sauber said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe the new information that gave Fitzgerald pause was less exculpatory than suggesting that Rove might be able to help the Special Prosecutor go after bigger fish than Libby or Rove.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/lowry/lowry200511010819.asp">Rich Lowry</a> tells us that no one on the right dismissed the serious of the PlameGate investigations:<br />
<blockquote>With the exception of a feint by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, which she immediately regretted, and few other wobbles, at least conservatives haven’t contradicted their core contention from the 1990s that lying under oath is a serious crime. In this, they finally have some company from liberals, who also have a strange, newfound affection for relentlessly truth-seeking prosecutors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rich would never lie to us – would he?  Maybe we’ll chalk this up to a faulty memory – so could everyone please help Rich out on this score.</p>

                                <p>Republicans on Capitol Hill are going ahead with their plans to trim the budget.  Despite Tom Delay&#8217;s assurances that there remains no fat in the federal budget after several years of Republican rule in Washington, they have bravely identified cuts totaling $50bn &#8211; over five years &#8211; in health care and food assistance to the poor.</p>
<p>Needless to say, these cuts are tiny relative to the overall budget, but will have a huge impact on the poverty-stricken individuals affected.  As Jonathan Weisman puts it in today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/31/AR2005103101497.html">Washington Post</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Even $50 billion is just a 0.6 percent nick out of the $7.8 trillion in federal entitlement spending expected over the next five years. At $844 million over five years, the embattled food-stamp cuts account for less than half a percent of the total food-stamp budget over that time, said House Agriculture Committee Chairman Robert W. Goodlatte (R-Va.).</p></blockquote>
<p>Weisman is good enough to provide a bit of context for this tiny cut in food assistance:<br />
<blockquote>On Friday, as the Agriculture Committee was drafting budget-cutting legislation that could knock 295,000 people off food stamps, the Agriculture Department released findings that 529,000 more Americans went hungry last year than in 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, given the apparent Republican sentiment that a 0.5% reduction in a program is negligible, and that they are desperately trying to reach the paltry goal of $10bn per year in budget cuts, let me pose a question to House Republicans: why not make an equally negligible cut in the defense budget?  A cut of only half a percent in the defense budget would yield budget savings of around $12 bn &#8211; compared to the $844 million that would be saved by denying food assistance to hundreds of thousands of this nation&#8217;s most impoverished people.  </p>
<p>Would a cut of 0.5% of the defense budget &#8211; which Republicans argue is such a small cut as to be irrelevant when it comes to food assistance for the poor &#8211; have any noticeable impact on national security?  Unless you can persuade me that the answer to this question is yes, I am forced to conclude that focusing budget cuts almost exclusively on programs that help the poor, despite the inconsequential budget savings that such cuts would yield, is not really about reducing the budget deficit, and instead is just plain mean-spirited.</p>

                                <p>Having watched the various pundits on Sunday morning’s talk shows, I wanted to pass along a couple of the items I learned from the rightwing masters of spin as well as provide a graph.  Alas, I’m not sure how to graph Fitzmas so that will have to await until tomorrow, but I was able to find an excuse to provide a graph of retail prices for regular gasoline (my <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/wrgp/mogas_history.html">source</a>). </p>

<p>My excuse was George Will’s comment on This Week yesterday that we Democrats are really dumb.  His example of our stupidity was a comment a couple of weeks ago by Senator Reid that gasoline prices were quite high.  Will claimed that at the time the Senator had made this speech, we had just witnessed a record decline in prices.  It would seem that prices have come down since then too – but would you call them low?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader Eclaire makes an excellent point – my series is in nominal terms so a careful analysis would adjust for inflation.  Back in August 1990, a nominal price of $1.20 translates into today’s dollar into an inflation-adjusted price of $1.65.  In the spring of 2001, the nominal price was $1.70, which translates into an inflation-adjusted price of $1.87.  Of course, it costs about $2.50 a gallon for regular gasoline today, which is not as bad as $3 a gallon in early September.  But then the September 2005 price was about twice what we were paying in late 2003 – even inflation-adjusted.  So wouldn’t one expect prices to have fallen from their September 2005 levels?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The latest data regarding the personal income received by Americans has me slightly worried.  The headlines of stories about today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/newsrelarchive/2005/pi0905.htm">BEA news release</a> have been along the lines of &#8220;<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B63276A77-A1A6-4B3B-BC79-D0C6FA9B738E%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">Real spending falls 2 months in a row</a>&#8220;.  But I&#8217;m actually more concerned about real income growth.</p>
<p>Take a look at the following picture.  It shows the 12-month growth in real disposable personal income.  After two years of pretty good income growth, this year has seen a decided slowdown in such growth.  Over the past 12 months real income grew by just 1.5%.  Meanwhile, the savings rate was actually negative for the full third quarter &#8211; the first negative quarterly savings rate on record. </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/income_savings1.jpg"></p>
<p>A negative savings rate is only sustainable for a short period of time, and depends on rapidly rising asset prices. If you add together slowing income growth with the fact that the savings rate will almost certainly rise as the housing bubble slows (or pops), the likely conclusion is that consumption spending will slow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/gdp-and-housing.html">Calculated Risk</a> has outlined how the economy is likely to respond to the apparent slowdown in the housing market.  Furthermore, business spending is showing some signs of gradual cooling (as I mentioned <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/new-gdp-figures.html">last week</a>), and in general the economy seems to be slowing slightly from its 2004 pace.  Finally, the risk of a coming <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/more-on-missing-inflation.html">upturn in the core rate</a> of inflation seems real.</p>
<p>Add all of these trends together, and I&#8217;m starting to worry about the economic outlook for 2006.  Slowing growth, with possibly higher core inflation&#8230;  Ben Bernanke may start his tenure as Fed chair with some tricky monetary policy management to do.</p>
