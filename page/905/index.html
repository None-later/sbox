                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A while back, shortly after his identity was made public, Atrios wrote about the difference, or rather, the lack of difference, between writing as Atrios and writing as Duncan Black.  (I wish I could find that post.  Unfortunately, I have to work from my memory, which isn’t always that great.)  He noted that if he wrote a lot of nonsense and signed it Duncan Black, Duncan Black would lose all credibility.  If he wrote a lot of nonsense and signed it Atrios, Atrios would lose all credibility.  As a result, writing anonymously though with a recognizable handle didn’t somehow give him license to write a lot of nonsense.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this yesterday… when someone spoofed my handle on one of the comment threads.  Now, I’m not Atrios.  Angry Bear is a not a high traffic site, its somewhat specialized, and I am only one of its writers.  <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/">Eschaton</a>, Atrios’ site, on the other hand, is one of the big boys (we’re talking orders of magnitude difference in hits), Atrios looks at all sorts of news, and he’s the only poster (except when he’s out of the office).  But one thing we have in common – just as Duncan Black took care of the name Atrios, I try to ensure that what goes out signed by cactus is accurate.  </p>
<p>Now, cactus is not entirely anonymous.  I’ve provided enough information about myself to allow a regular reader with a good memory of that information to track down my “secret identity” within five minutes or so, provided they had access to Google or Yahoo.  I do think (and I don’t think Atrios mentioned this, but again, I don’t remember that post) cactus is slightly different from, well, me.  The two are very similar, of course.  Former students have written to cactus inquiring whether cactus was the guy who used to teach econ.  But there are some differences in personality…  If I’m going to be honest, cactus is probably a little more confrontational, a bit more judgmental, and takes himself a bit more seriously than my real life persona.  But the resemblance is remarkable.  </p>
<p>So why care about the cactus persona?  Well, I’m still anonymous, but even some bloggers who are not – much bigger names like Atrios and TBogg identities are known – still use their pseudonyms.  Perhaps its because they’re used to it.  In my case… well, I still haven’t figured out what I want to do with my life.  Who knows, maybe one day I’ll be come a Republican.  (Heh heh heh.)  Regardless, I am not wealthy, independently or otherwise, and for the short run, I don’t want to limit my options.</p>
<p>Anyway, I doubt any of that matters to the person who spoofed my handle.  I have no idea if it will happen again.  But I wouldn’t be surprised.  I guess I hit a nerve.  The spoofer doesn’t like what I write.  But they can’t find a way to argue and prove me wrong.  That’s not to say I am not sometimes wrong, as regular readers can attest.  But clearly, on the things that matter to the spoofer, the spoofer is unable to do it, unwilling to change his or her mind when presented with facts contrary to his/her perspective, and unwilling to walk away.  Unable, or more likely, unwilling to recognize its because of his or her own feeble arguments and inferior reasoning skills, he or she strikes in the only way he can – like a child.  So to the spoofer – I can’t stop you, so do whatever makes you feel big.  Knock yourself out.  And feel very proud.</p>
<p>Update.<br />In comments, Nicholas Weaver makes a good point:  &#8220;Its not ANONYMITY anyway, its stable PSEUDONYMs. Theres a huge difference.&#8221;  Put another, for those who follow this blog, cactus has been imbued with an identity and a character.  Only a handful of people would recognize my &#8220;real name&#8221; if they saw it, so for all practical purpses, the identity I have in matters related to economics is cactus.</p>

<div>I sometimes pity <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Y2Y2Y2NiNzA3ZWZiODZkNmNiZjkyMjU5MjMyYzczZjE=">Jonah Goldberg</a>. He reads some nonsense from Jeopardy champion <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/capitalcommerce/070131/is_the_unemployment_rate_about.htm">James Pethokoukis</a> and sees the names Michael Darda and immediately thinks this fellow has the Nobel Prize winning caliber of a Lawrence Kudlow (hint to Goldberg – that’s a joke):</div>
<p>
<blockquote>I am starting to lend more personal credence to the theory that a combination of strong growth, fat corporate profits, and already tight labor market might push the unemployment rate to lows we have not seen since the 1960s.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The current unemployment rate is 4.5%, which matches the unemployment rate for October 1998. The unemployment rate continued to fall until it dropped to 4% as of December 1999 where it stayed for the rest of Clinton’s term in office. Darda, Goldberg, and Pethokoukis seem to be as unaware of this fact as they are of the fact that the civilian labor force participation rate (LFP) was higher during the late 1990’s than it is today. I made this simple for the National Review know-nothings by graphing LFP from 1997 to 2006. I also graphed the employment to population rate (EP), which was around 64% or more for most of Clinton’s second term. Today, it is only 63.4%. Given that the National Review know nothings probably don’t have a clue why I graph these two together, let me just point out for their benefit that the unemployment rate represents the difference between LFP and EP. So Corner Kids – please follow this carefully as it has two important parts: (a) the unemployment rate (the difference between LFP and EP) is actually wider than it was in 2000; and (b) LFP is also lower than it was in 2000. Combine these two facts and you can understand why the employment to population rate is lower than when it was during the late 1990’s. Is this so hard for these folks to understand. </p>
<p>
<div>OK &#8211; I would not expect a National Review nitwit to know anything about the labor market. But could someone be so kind to tell Mr. Goldberg that Lawrence Kudlow knows nothing about economics either &#8211; and that one should not trust the spin from Michael Darda? Then again – given the fact that Jonah Goldberg neither has a clue about anything related to economics and his is also clueless who to turn to for insights – why on earth does he bother to write his incessant nonsense about economic matters. Couldn’t he stick to something he does understand (albeit that might be an empty set)? </div>

                                <p>I&#8217;m getting a lot of mail from readers.  Seems Riedl&#8217;s post has stirred up a hornet&#8217;s nest.   I will be happy to post some replies from our readers.   I didn&#8217;t intend to post any that covered more than one Riedl myth at a time, but this one seems to do it well&#8230;</p>
<p>Reader alkali19 (e-mail &#8211; his/her name, plus a g-mail period com) sends this, adapted from some comments he/she posted at <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/2007/01/hilarious/#comment">Matthew Yglesia&#8217;s site</a> site.  </p>
<p>Myth #2: The Bush tax cuts substantially reduced 2006 revenues and expanded the budget deficit.<br />Fact: Nearly all of the 2006 budget deficit resulted from additional spending above the baseline.</p>
<p>Riedl explains:</p>
<p>&#8220;The best way to measure the swing from surplus to deficit is by comparing the pre–tax cut budget baseline of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) with what actually happened. &#8230; [In 2006,] 90 percent of the swing from surplus to deficit resulted from higher-than-projected spending, and only 10 percent resulted from lower-than-projected revenues.&#8221; </p>
<p>That result also appears to be unique to 2006. Here is that same analysis presented over all of 2002-2006. (The first column is the percentage of change from baseline resulting from higher spending, the second is the percentage resulting from lower revenues.) </p>
<p>2002 34% 66%<br />2003 35% 65%<br />2004 42% 58%<br />2005 65% 35%<br />2006 90% 10%<br />Total 54% 46%</p>
<p>In short, if you don&#8217;t look at just 2006, it&#8217;s clear that revenue shortfalls are responsible (under Riedl&#8217;s metric) for just under half of the deficits versus baseline.</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity, I stripped out Iraq war spending for 2003 through 2006 and re-ran the analysis for those years:</p>
<p>2003 29% 71%<br />2004 34% 66%<br />2005 58% 42%<br />2006 88% 12%<br />Total 50% 50%</p>
<p>Note: here is a <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=ppLpMo0_CLrp3hH4GJvuTYw">spreadsheet</a>  showing my calculations.</p>
<p>Comment re: Myth 4</p>
<p>Myth #4: Capital gains tax cuts do not pay for themselves.<br />Fact: Capital gains tax revenues doubled following the 2003 tax cut.</p>
<p>That result depends on the the unusual variability of capital gains tax receipts.  Here are capital gains tax revenues for 2006 and the last 10 years (in billions, per CBO):</p>
<p>1996 54<br />1997 72<br />1998 84<br />1999 99<br />2000 119<br />2001 100<br />2002 58<br />2003 50*<br />2004 61<br />2005 84<br />2006 103*</p>
<p>(Riedl&#8217;s analysis appears to be based on the figures with asterisks.)</p>
<p>We know that the economy did not double in size between 2003 and 2006 &#8212; it grew at about 2.5% per year in real dollars. So what we are seeing here is mostly the fact that capital gains taxes vary a lot by reason of the business cycle, not any great macroeconomic lesson about how capital gains taxes supposedly pay for themselves. There&#8217;s no reason to think that if capital gains taxes had been left alone in 2003, capital gains tax receipts in 2006 wouldn&#8217;t have been something more like $134b. </p>
<p>(Amusingly, this Myth #4 immediately follows Myth #3: Supply-side economics assumes that all tax cuts immediately pay for themselves. Fact: It assumes replenishment of some but not necessarily all lost revenues. Alas, the supply-siders just can&#8217;t resist the temptation.)</p>

                                <p>PGL has had a number of posts in which he notes that cutting tax rates without cutting spending is little more than defering taxes.  Reader T-bone (reachable at tim of mars, all one word, at gmail) sends some additional thoughts:</p>
<p>Regarding looming deficit, it seems Bush has given tax breaks but without decreasing spending. This seems like having your cake and eating it too regarding economic growth. Shouldn&#8217;t we be booming with economic growth with this unsustainable policy? When people point to minor inprovements in growth to support this policy, all I can think is &#8220;You expected worse???&#8221;. So this current economic policy answers the question of what is better, spending increases or tax breaks, with the answer: BOTH! </p>
<p>I would bet if we had to substitute some spending to pay for the bush tax cuts to keep a balanced budget, the economic growth would decline compared to no cuts and keeping the spending. Though to prove why spending is generally more efficient would require another in depth analysis that strays from this topic. But the short answer is that spending tends to employ new people either who had no income or who now give up their previous jobs to someone who had no income, which is similar to a tax break for the poorest. I&#8217;ve also argued elsewhere that the spending habits of the people with less money tends to instantly create demand when given more money, whereas wealthier people tend to store the money in a banks/investments, which increases investment availability, not demand. </p>
<p>Regarding the relevance to the actual needs of the country, I also have some theories on the &#8220;quality&#8221; of the growth of GDP that comes from tax breaks for the wealthiest.</p>
<p>For example, what added benefit would we get if a wealthy person uses his newfound wealth to get a custom made car that takes 15 times the effort and personel to create compared to the production-line stamped-out lexus he would have bought without the tax cut? Or what if he just hired a few more servants to wipe his butt? The only real benefit is that it employed a few people for a while. And this is only in cases where the wealthy person has spent the money rather than saved it. </p>
<p>How is that end result different from if the government employed some people to sit around all day. Money still gets to the people who will spend it on the more efficiently created goods, except now the wealthy guy has to wipe his own butt. And imagine if those government employees actually were employed to serve the public in ways that do not compete with private sector goods and services.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know, for all this talk about recession, (with some pundits calling for a recession just about every year &#8211; Paul Krugman comes to mind), the reality is that economic growth has been steady and strong following the 2001-2002 recession. Think lower marginal tax rates, implemented in 2003 to strengthen work incentives, and significantly increase after-tax investment rewards.  This is Goldilocks plus. It is called free market, Milton Friedman capitalism &#8211; with a strong dose of supply-side guru Art Laffer.</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, Paul Krugman does not “call for a recession” every year.  Secondly, while Kudlow’s 3.5% overall real GDP growth claim was borne out this morning, he really should have waited for the details before he claimed investment demand would be strong.  Overall, fixed investment demand seems to be falling at an 11% annualized rate.  This is mainly due to declining residential investment but also due to a slip in business investment.  So it was left to a growth in net exports, consumption growth being at a 4.4% clip, and government purchase growth being at a 3.7% clip.  As far as Federal government purchases, it seems nondefense purchases fell while the DoD is spending growth is strong.  So Larry can cheer about all those new defense expenditures as national savings continues to decline.  Not exactly the free market that Milton Friedman envisioned.</p>

<blockquote>When people across the world look at America&#8217;s economy what they see is low inflation, low unemployment, and the fastest growth of any major industrialized nation. The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in the United States. There is one undisputed leader in the world in terms of economy, and that&#8217;s the United States of America &#8230; Our economic leadership also depends on sensible, pro-growth tax policies. To help bring our economy out of a recession and recover from September the 11th, we cut taxes on the American people. We cut taxes on everybody who pays income taxes. We doubled the child tax credit. We reduced the marriage penalty. We cut taxes on small businesses. And we cut taxes on dividends and capital gains. There&#8217;s a lot of political debate about these tax cuts. But here are some of the facts: Since we enacted major tax relief into law in 2003, our economy has created nearly 7.2 million new jobs. Our economy has expanded by more than 13 percent. That expansion is roughly the size of the entire Canadian economy. This economic growth has led to record tax revenues, which has helped us cut the deficit in half three years ahead of schedule. One fact should be clear when you look at the statistics: The fastest way to kill a recovery would be to raise taxes on the people who created it. Now is not the time for the federal government to be raising taxes on the American people.  We must ensure that the money you send to Washington is spent wisely. Next Monday, I&#8217;m going to submit to Congress a budget that will eliminate the deficit by 2012. In order to do so, we need to set priorities in Washington. You can&#8217;t try to be all things to all people when it comes to spending your money if you want to keep taxes low, keep the economy growing, and balance the budget. </p></blockquote>
<p>Pardon my interruption but President Bush has been “all things to all people” with his Spend&#038;Spend and Borrow&#038;Borrow fiscal policy.  Now the President babbles on as to how he wants to cut spending and reduce trade barriers, but then I have to wonder-  who was that fellow acting as President over the past six years?   There was also a long discussion as to health care policy followed by his desire to spending more taxpayer money to develop sources of energy other than imported oil.  Oh yea – back to the trade protectionist big spending we used to know as our President.  Bush also says we should spend more funds on education and resource.  You see – a “Big Government Conservative” never has to choose between spending more versus taxing less.  After all – that promise to balance the budget.  It’s all smoke and mirrors funded by the Social Security Trust Fund reserves.</p>

<div></div>
<p>
<div>When <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/brian-riedls-first-myth.html">Cactus</a> commented on the first myth from <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg2001.cfm#_ftn1">Brian Riedl</a> &#8211; for a moment I thought we’d discovered the true identity of the troll who calls himself Patrick R. Sullivan (or was it Roland Patrick or the host of other names he uses to attack the comment box of Brad DeLong’s blog). Riedl writes:</p>
<p></div>
<blockquote><p>Tax revenues in 2006 were 18.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), which is<br />actually above the 20-year, 40-year, and 60-year historical aver­ages … While revenues as a percentage of GDP have not fully returned to pre-recession levels (20.9 percent in 2000), it is now clear that the pre-recession level was a major historical anomaly caused by a tempo­rary stock market bubble.</p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Our favorite troll makes the same claims as he tries to argue that it’s not possible to have taxes be more than 19% of GDP for a sustained period of time. Our graph shows the ratio of taxes to GDP as well as the ratio of Federal spending to GDP from 1946 to 2005. While it is true that the average tax to GDP ratio for this 60-year period is just over 18%, which was the tax to GDP ratio for 2005, there are several problems with this abuse of a 60-year average. First of all, the tax to GDP ratio was very close to 20% during both the late 1960’s and in 1981 (before the Reagan tax cut and Reagan recession) so this anomaly claim is just false. We should also note that the tax to GDP ratio exceeded 19% for the six year period from 1995 to 2001.</p>
<p>Also notice that until the 1970’s, Federal spending as a share of GDP typically was below 19%. In fact, it was typically below 17% of GDP during the late 1940’s and during the 1950’s. While the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations wanted to pay down the Federal debt accumulated during World War II, they didn’t need taxes to be 20% of GDP in order to do so.</p></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>What Riedl also fails to admit is that the reductions in the taxes collected relative to GDP after 1981 and after 2001 have led to increases in Federal debt, which are deferred taxes. Riedl wants us to believe that Federal spending as a share of GDP is high relative to historical standards. Well – if by historical standards include the 1920’s and the 1950’s, he’s right. But if he is referring to the period since 1970, he’s is not correct.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Finally, Riedl forgets to mention the change in the composition of Federal tax revenues. Over the past 20 years, we&#8217;ve collected more in the form of payroll contributions that in part were supposed to be establishing a Social Security Trust Fund reserve to pay for those retirement benefits of the Baby Boomers. Alas, we have been collecting less in the form of income taxes. I would expect a rightwing troll to admit this &#8211; but someone who works for the Heritage Foundation should. So why didn&#8217;t Mr. Riedl acknowledge any of this? </div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002819.html">Max Sawicky</a> comments on Riedl’s 10 myths by first saying it is one of the dumbest things he has seen coming out of Heritage and then this:</div>
<div>
<blockquote>The real myth is that anyone over there knows what the hell they are talking<br />about. One reason it is stupid, apart from the economic misinformation, is the<br />assumption that the reader is stupid &#8211; that he cannot see through the transparent weasel logic.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>In other words, it’s like most of garbage put forth by the National Review. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/2007/01/hilarious">Matthew Yglesias</a> nails this one:<br />
<blockquote>wonder, did they calculate the average dating back to independence in 1776 or only back to the constitution taking effect in 1789? In related developments, a twelve inch black and white television has better picture quality than a player piano and our troops in Iraq are only insufficiently equipped if you forget that the historical average indicates that soldiers typically rely on horse-drawn<br />transportation. </p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Reader Steve Miller pointed me to an <a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2007/01/ten_myths_of_th.html">Andrew Sullivan post</a>.  Sullivan states:  “Some things the left won’t tell you” and then produces some quotes taken from this, um, <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg2001.cfm#_ftn1">write-up</a> by Brian M. Riedl at the Heritage Foundation entitled “Ten Myths About the Bush Tax Cuts.”  I don’t have time to look at all of these now, but I’ll start with “Myth 1” and cover other “myths” in later dates.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/pdf/hist.pdf">this document</a> and tells us to reference OMB Table 1.3 to make a point.  Note to Riedl – its easier to work with the data when its not in PDF format – look <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z3.xls">here</a> instead.</p>
<p>So, without further ado… <br />“Myth #1: Tax revenues remain low.<br />Fact: Tax revenues are above the historical average, even after the tax cuts.”</p>
<p>Riedl goes on… “Tax revenues in 2006 were 18.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), which is actually above the 20-year, 40-year, and 60-year historical averages.”  </p>
<p>Now, he links to this document <br /><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/pdf/hist.pdf">this document</a> and tells us to reference OMB Table 1.3 to make a point.  Note to Riedl – its easier to work with the data when its not in PDF format – look <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z3.xls">here</a> instead.  Anyway, wherever you check, this morning OMB Table 1.3 shows estimated tax revenues for 2006 to be 17.5 percent.  Now, I wouldn’t trust the estimated figures, especially when coming out of this White House, but Riedl is not getting his figure from where he tells us he’s getting his figure.  18.4% is not 17.5%.  Perhaps 18.4% is an 11th myth he forgot to number?</p>
<p>Continuing… when I take the average 20 year receipts (1986 to 2005), they are in fact 18.4%, which is higher than the receipts in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and the estimated receipts in 2006 (17.9%, 16.5%, 16.3%, 17.5%, and 17.5% respectively).  40 year receipts – 18.3%, were also higher than for each year since 2002.  60 year receipts were at 17.9% &#8211; now we’re getting somewhere.  GW actually managed to equal the 60 year average… in 2002 before the worst effects of his tax cuts really took hold.  </p>
<p>Even if it turns out that receipts do rise in 2006 to 18.4% &#8211; I wouldn’t be crowing about a single outlier year if I were Riedl, or Sullivan for that matter, but then, I’m neither one, for which I am very thankful.  When I have time, I’ll look at the other “myths” Riedl wrote about.  I’d suggest Riedl do the same, but then again, he works for the Heritage Foundation, and no doubt he wants to keep that gig.  Its easier than looking at what the data actually says.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Update&#8230;  Reader Rana suggests that the data comes from the CBO.  <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/77xx/doc7731/01-24-BudgetOutlook.pdf">CBO Table 1-3</a> does indeed show tax receipts at 18.4% of GDP, so Riedl&#8217;s figure for 2006 is correct, even if the source he gives is wrong.  </p>
<p>Comparing the CBO figures to data from previous years at <br /><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/%20sheets/hist02z3.xls">OMB Table 2.3</a>, we find that individual tax receipts are up &#8230; almost to the point they were in 2002.  Corporate tax collections are at 2.3 percent – they haven’t been above 2 percent since the year 2000.  As I noted in other posts, this probably has more to do, paradoxically, with the IRS willingness to forgive past tax evasion in exchange for some amount of current payment.  “Other” is also at quite a high – apparently some sort of hidden taxes &#8211; things like fees and so forth.</p>
<p>So… a second look at this myth… Riedl is partly right… tax receipts are once again, after several awful years, back at their 20 and 40 year averages.  If they remain this way, at least for two or three years, when it comes to tax collection, the last few years of GW&#8217;s term will be, well, average.  That is… if they remain this way.  Considering GW&#8217;s performance in other areas, I can see why Riedl is excited.</p>

I note that in many ways, buying a stolen item is similar to buying shares of Enron while the storyline is still good.  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_E._White">You may recall that GW bought the storyline, on behalf of the country, with disastrous results.</a>)</p>
<p>In the end, the buyer, or the last buyer, holds the bag.  The last buyer may get a small amount of compensation from some of the perpetrators, but for the most part, buyers get hosed.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As a follow up to my post on Monday about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/measuring-instability.html">measuring instability</a>, let&#8217;s say one wants to measure the potential for democracy or &#8220;democratic reform.&#8221;  Consider&#8230; the US has for a long time had good relations with Saudi Arabia.  In many ways, the relationship has gotten, well, gooder, under GW.  Signs of this range from our President <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&#038;q=bush%20abdullah&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;oe=UTF-8&#038;sa=N&#038;tab=wi">holding hands with Abdullah</a> (my suspicion is that GW has never held hands with any man since he was three, and if one were to say he was respecting Abdullah&#8217;s culture, well, in many parts of the world men greet each other with a kiss &#8211; and we haven&#8217;t see GW do that at all) to Cheney&#8217;s getting called on the Saudi carpet when some idiots in the administration were contemplating the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/30/AR2006113001710.html">&#8220;20 percent solution&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The US relationship with Pakistan has also gotten significantly gooder under GW.  I&#8217;m just thinking of how small the price has been for Pakistan to pay for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Qadeer_Khan">Khan&#8217;s transfer of WMD technology to rogue states</a>.  I&#8217;m thinking that since it was all accomplished on official Pakistani aircraft, and since Pakistan won&#8217;t let US agents talk to him, the Pakistani government must have been more involved than the official story.  I also think about how its general knowledge that at a very minimum, elements in the Pakistani security services are helping the Taliban.  </p>
<p>So the question&#8230; why is the US being so friendly these and other states run by people that hate us and do what they can to hurt us.  Let&#8217;s leave out conspiracy theories, and take GW at his word.  He claims he&#8217;s all for supporting the forces of democracy.  Let us assume he believes these countries are becoming more democratic. </p>
<p>Now, leaving GW out of this, how would one objectively quantify whether a leader of a country, or even the country as a whole, is ready to become more democratic?</p>
