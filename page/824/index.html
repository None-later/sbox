<p>Big news in the auto industry.</p>
<p>(After this post I am going to start a series on healthcare and leave the auto industry alone, well, except that the first healthcare post will deal with a major development in the auto industry regarding healthcare. If any of you have any topics you want addressed let me know below.)</p>
<p>Chrysler, in the midst of a private equity buyout, has done a deal with a Chinese manufacturer to manufacture cars for the US market.</p>
<p>Neither the Big 2+1 or the foreign brands (Toyota, Honda, etc.) will be able to compete with labor which will likely cost $10 &#8211; $20 per worker per day.</p>
<p>This will not be an overnight phenomena, but I fear this is one more nail in the coffin of US manufacturing in general, not just the auto sector.</p>
<p>Update: Delphi is not going to offshore 80% of  blue collar jobs immediately. Delphi is going to offshore <strong>90%</strong> of blue collar jobs as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In the next 10 years or so most auto parts manufacturing jobs will be gone, chasing cheaper labor. Within 20 years many of the auto assembly jobs could be gone.</p>
<p>So what do the workers do?  Can they all work at Wal-Mart and Home Depot?  What happens to blue collar America? Will income inequality continue to grow? How will this impact retirements and healthcare? More questions than answers.</p>
<p>Economists love to talk about comparative advantage and creative destruction, but there are real people at the end of those policies.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>

                                <p>Reader Dan points to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/06/AR2007070601993.html?nav=rss_print/outlook">outsourcing of the CIA</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our national security is being outsourced.</p>
<p>The most intriguing secrets of the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; have nothing to do with al-Qaeda and its fellow travelers. They&#8217;re about the mammoth private spying industry that all but runs U.S. intelligence operations today.</p>
<p>Surprised? No wonder. In April, Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell was poised to publicize a year-long examination of outsourcing by U.S. intelligence agencies. But the report was inexplicably delayed &#8212; and suddenly classified a national secret. What McConnell doesn&#8217;t want you to know is that the private spy industry has succeeded where no foreign government has: It has penetrated the CIA and is running the show.</p>
<p>Over the past five years (some say almost a decade), there has been a revolution in the intelligence community toward wide-scale outsourcing. Private companies now perform key intelligence-agency functions, to the tune, I&#8217;m told, of more than $42 billion a year. Intelligence professionals tell me that more than 50 percent of the National Clandestine Service (NCS) &#8212; the heart, brains and soul of the CIA &#8212; has been outsourced to private firms such as Abraxas, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.</p>
<p>These firms recruit spies, create non-official cover identities and control the movements of CIA case officers. They also provide case officers and watch officers at crisis centers and regional desk officers who control clandestine operations worldwide. As the Los Angeles Times first reported last October, more than half the workforce in two key CIA stations in the fight against terrorism &#8212; Baghdad and Islamabad, Pakistan &#8212; is made up of industrial contractors, or &#8220;green badgers,&#8221; in CIA parlance.</p>
<p>Intelligence insiders say that entire branches of the NCS have been outsourced to private industry. These branches are still managed by U.S. government employees (&#8220;blue badgers&#8221;) who are accountable to the agency&#8217;s chain of command. But beneath them, insiders say, is a supervisory structure that&#8217;s controlled entirely by contractors; in some cases, green badgers are managing green badgers from other corporations.</p></blockquote>

I was going to post something yesterday, but I was unable to place my cursor in the box that says &#8220;Title&#8221; in blogger.  In other words, I can&#8217;t put a title on posts. </p>
<p>I seem to still be able to place by cursor anywhere else.  This is really, really strange.  </p>
<p>Anyone have any idea what this is about?  Or am I destined to become an untitled blogger?</p>

<p>Update&#8230; Thanks to reader wufnik I&#8217;ve managed to stick a title at the top of this post&#8230;  but it does seem to have been a bit of luck.  Not sure I can replicate it&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Reader Dan asks questions about sustained combat operations&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=background.view&#038;backgroundid=00192">General Odom</a> writes about our troops for the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University concerning how today&#8217;s combat is different than in other conflicts:</p>
<blockquote><p>No U.S. forces have ever been compelled to stay in sustained combat conditions for as long as the Army units have in Iraq. In World War II, soldiers were considered combat-exhausted after about 180 days in the line. They were withdrawn for rest periods. Moreover, for weeks at a time, large sectors of the front were quiet, giving them time for both physical and psychological rehabilitation. During some periods of the Korean War, units had to fight steadily for fairly long periods but not for a year at a time. In Vietnam, tours were one year in length, and combat was intermittent with significant break periods.<br />    In Iraq, combat units take over an area of operations and patrol it daily, making soldiers face the prospect of death from an IED or small arms fire or mortar fire several hours each day. Day in and day out for a full year, with only a single two-week break, they confront the prospect of death, losing limbs or eyes, or suffering other serious wounds. Although total losses in Iraq have been relatively small compared to most previous conflicts, the individual soldier is risking death or serious injury day after day for a year. The impact on the psyche accumulates, eventually producing what is now called &#8220;post-traumatic stress disorders.&#8221; In other words, they are combat-exhausted to the point of losing effectiveness. The occasional willful killing of civilians in a few cases is probably indicative of such loss of effectiveness. These incidents don&#8217;t seem to occur during the first half of a unit&#8217;s deployment in Iraq.</p>
<p>    After the first year, following a few months back home, these same soldiers are sent back for a second year, then a third year, and now, many are facing a fourth deployment! Little wonder more and more soldiers and veterans are psychologically disabled. </p>
<p>    And the damage is not just to enlisted soldiers. Many officers are suffering serious post-traumatic stress disorders but are hesitant to report it &#8211; with good reason. An officer who needs psychiatric care and lets it appear on his medical records has most probably ended his career. He will be considered not sufficiently stable to lead troops. Thus officers are strongly inclined to avoid treatment and to hide their problems.</p>
<p>    There are only two ways to fix this problem, both of which the president stubbornly rejects. Instead, his recent &#8220;surge&#8221; tactic has compelled the secretary of defense to extend Army tours to 15 months! (The Marines have been allowed to retain their six-month deployment policy and, not surprisingly, have fewer cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The General continues by saying we can support our troops by doubling or tripling the manpower or by beginning withdrawal as soon as and as secure as possible. </p>
<p>Is this picture accurate?</p>
<p>If the privately employed manpower were regular military service, could combat time be reduced in some way to help alleviate this daily exposure, given that privately contracted personnel cannot substitute for any regular military?  Or is it not an issue?</p>

<p>Under our discussion of Friday’s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/june-employment-increase.html">employment report</a> AB reader Sebastian Holsclaw asked a reasonable question as to whether the aging of the baby boomers might be putting a downward trend to both the labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio.  Well &#8211; <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=07&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=jobs_report_sagging_employment">Dean Baker</a> came through for us:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the unemployment rate stands at a relatively low 4.5 percent, the employment rate, the percentage of the population with jobs, has been inching lower. This is not a demographic story. The declining employment rate [EPOP] is being driven by prime age workers. The employment rate for workers ages 25 to 54 has fallen from 80.3 percent in January to 80.0 percent in June.</p></blockquote>
<p>I promised to graph the labor force participation rate not only in terms of the overall rate, but also the rates for the young ones (16 to 24), the old ones (55 and up), and the rest of us (25 to 54).  The graph goes back to 2000.  From December 2000 to December 2003 – we witnessed the following:</p>
<p>The overall rate dropped from 67.0% to 66.0%<br />The rate for the 16 to 24 crowd plummeted from 65.9% to 60.5%<br />The rate for the 25 to 54 crowd fell from 83.9% to 82.8%<br />The rate for the 55 plus crowd rose from 32.6% to 36.0%</p>
<p>Then we had the recovery so from December 2003 to December 2006 – we witnessed the following:</p>
<p>The overall rate rose from 66.0% to 66.4%<br />The rate for the 16 to 24 crowd rose from 60.5% to 60.9%<br />The rate for the 25 to 54 crowd rose from 82.8% to 83.2%<br />The rate for the 55 plus crowd rose from 36.0% to 38.5%</p>
<p>Oh happy days – well, sort of.  But let’s look at what Dean is telling us.  From December 2006 to June 2007 &#8211; we witnessed the following:</p>
<p>The overall rate dropped from 66.4% to 66.1%<br />The rate for the 16 to 24 crowd fell from 60.9% to 59.6%<br />The rate for the 25 to 54 crowd fell from 83.2% to 82.9%<br />The rate for the 55 plus crowd rose from 38.5% to 38.6%</p>
<p>This isn’t looking good and is not entirely attributable to the elders retiring.</p>

                                <p>William Kristol Hearts Machiavellian Presidency</p>
<p>When did Faux News decide to slip truth serum into the coffee served to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/07/08/kristol-machiavellian">Bill Kristol</a>? </p>
<blockquote><p>This morning, the Weekly Standard’s Bill Kristol &#8211; who accurately predicted the President’s decision to commute Libby’s sentence &#8211; suggested the order was timed to provide political cover for the decision by attacking President Clinton. “Here’s why the president acted the way he did. He knew Bill Clinton was joining Hillary in Iowa on July 4th. No, I’m serious,” Kristol said. “So on July 2d, Ed Gillespie, who’s a very canny Republican operator, said, Let’s pardon Libby. Clinton will rise to the bait, and we could spend the last half of the week debating the unbelievable Clinton pardons against the defensible Bush pardon.” Kristol concluded, “I regard this as an extremely clever Machiavellian move by the president. It cheers me up about the Bush White House, and I’m really heartened.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s recall how <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipd/A0524702.html">Machiavellian</a> is usually defined:</p>
<blockquote><p>being or acting in accordance with the principles of government analyzed in Machiavelli&#8217;s The Prince, in which political expediency is placed above morality and the use of craft and deceit to maintain the authority and carry out the policies of a ruler is described. </p>
<p>characterized by subtle or unscrupulous cunning, deception, expediency, or dishonesty.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep – this White House is Machiavellian.  One has to admire Kristol’s admission, but might we suggest a true conservative would never be heartened that the government has turned Machiavellian.</p>

                                <p>It seems that Jim Lehrer choose to endure David Brooks on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/july-dec07/sblibby_07-06.html">News Hour</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And my rationale was this &#8211; and I think it was the same as the president&#8217;s &#8211; that Scooter Libby did lie. He did commit perjury. And, so, he deserves to be punished. He deserved the past two years of disgrace, and maybe he deserved six months in prison.  But this &#8211; that crime was surrounded by a vast circus of hypocrisy and partisan dishonesty</p></blockquote>
<p>What?  David Brooks is about to blast the right for their circus of hypocrisy and partisan dishonesty?  Oh no, I interrupted him in the middle of his sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>starting with the original case, which was allegedly about outing a CIA agent, when it was never really about that, because, once it turned out that was Richard Armitage, nobody cared anymore, and then the hypocrisy over whether somebody should go to jail for perjury, with Democrats saying one thing with Clinton, another thing with Libby</p></blockquote>
<p>Couldn’t someone tell Mr. Brooks that a CIA agent WAS outed?  And that Richard Armitage blundered himself into the middle of Dick Cheney’s scheme is irrelevant.  Of course, Bill Clinton was not involved with PlameGate but David has to go to the standard rightwing well. </p>
<p>It also seems that <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2007/jul/06/letter_to_a_neighbor">Larry Johnson</a> has to endure the fact that David Brooks moved into his neighbor.  I suspect Larry was rather angry at a recent oped by <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/2007/07/03/opinion/03brooks.html&#038;OQ=_rQ3D1Q26nQ3DTopQ252fOpinionQ252fEditorialsQ2520andQ2520OpQ252dEdQ252fOpQ252dEdQ252fColumnistsQ252fDavidQ2520Brooks&#038;OP=4e285a96Q2FQ27LXQ5DQ27myF88mQ27Q2FeecQ27ecQ27eGQ278Q51Q22Q7BQ228Q7BQ27eGQ5DF887y,qmgY">David Brooks</a> until he read the suggested edits from <a href="http://www.davidcorn.com/archives/2007/07/a_memo_for_davi.php">David Corn</a>. Check out Larry’s letter to his new neighbor.  In case, you are wondering about the title of this post, Larry <a href="http://noquarter.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/07/bobos-mailbox.html">explains</a>. </p>
<p>One of the claims that Mr. Brooks made – which is another rightwing favorite talking point – is how Joe Wilson lied in his NY Times oped.  Just in case you missed out this claim has been thoroughly debunked &#8211; <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/014985.php">Josh Marshall</a> goes over this one more time.  For all his smiling and soft talk – it has been well established that David Brooks is as dishonest as the rest of these water carriers for this corrupt White House.  So why on earth does PBS invite this hack on their shows?  Maybe they feel sorry for him as he can’t even get a decent mail box without help from a neighbor.</p>

Kraemer and Jason Dedrick</a> of UC-Irvine, who strive to figure out where the value-added from the iPod is created.  Varian notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who makes the Apple iPod Here’s a hint: It is not Apple. The company outsources the entire manufacture of the device to a number of Asian enterprises, among them Asustek, Inventec Appliances and Foxconn.  But this list of companies isn’t a satisfactory answer either: They only do final assembly. What about the 451 parts that go into the iPod? Where are they made and by whom?</p></blockquote>
<p>What is really interesting is that only $144 of the value-added goes to the manufacturers so when you paid $299, $155 of the value-added went either to the distributors who sold the iPods for Apple or to Apple itself for the designer of this device.  The authors estimate that about 25% of the retail price was captured by the distributors with Apple getting $80 per iPod:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on these values, Apple’s gross profit on those units would be $80, which is 36% of the $224 estimated wholesale price. This $80 profit is greater than the price of any single input, so it is definitely greater than the value added for any of its partners.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Dark Matter types should love this paper.  Others who might find it interesting are transfer pricing geeks as well as accountants.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: This iPod accounting got me thinking about that old rule of thumb popularized by Robert Goldscheider.  <a href="http://ip-updates.blogspot.com/2004/08/ip-law-business-goldscheiders-25-rule.html">IP Updates</a> explains what it is and where it came from:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Robert Goldscheider arrived at this now-famous calculation in 1959 when one of his clients, Philco Corporation, had about 18 European licensees for its radio and phonograph patents. Goldscheider calculated that Philco&#8217;s licensees assumed the major risk of commercializing their products, about 75 percent. That left 25 percent of the risk to licensor Philco, reflected in a 25/75 percent split of pretax profits.</p></blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that in these particular deals, system profits were about 20% of sales with the royalty rate being about 5% of sales.  Many IP economists have criticized the use of this rule of thumb especially for sectors where profit margins were very high.  If one thinks about the $80 per iPod that Apple gets as a percentage of either wholesale prices or even retail prices, it exceeds 25% of revenues.  The authors of this paper note that much of the value-added for the manufacturers and distributors is likely captured by wages rather than profits.  So as a percent of system profits, Apple’s take is much higher than 25%.</p>

                                <p>Andrew Samwick offers us <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/07/how-to-advise-on-fiscal-policy.html">How to Advice on Fiscal Policy</a>.  While the whole post is worth a read, let me offer some highlights:</p>
<blockquote><p>The overriding problem in conducting fiscal policy is that politicians, in both the executive and legislative branches, face electoral pressure to please their current constituencies. It is extremely tempting for them to boost spending or lower taxes today, handing out windfalls to today&#8217;s voters and leaving an unrepresented constituency &#8211; future taxpayers &#8211; to foot the bill.  It takes an enormous amount of energy to resist that temptation. That energy has to come from the politician&#8217;s advisers &#8230; There are other advisers with a central role to play in fiscal policy, however, who are Presidential nominees who undergo Senate confirmation and who can be called to testify to Congress on the President&#8217;s policies. We should expect them to be the ones who look at the larger picture, who take a longer horizon into their policy discussions, and who do the heavy lifting to help the politician resist the temptation to use future generations&#8217; resources to buy votes today. On fiscal policy, the three main advisers are the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.  To address the overriding problem, these three advisers must insist on an explicit budget target &#8230; The standard can be that simple, and it isn&#8217;t as austere as I&#8217;m trying to make it sound. It doesn&#8217;t rule out cutting taxes during the weak part of a business cycle, for example, but it does rule out cutting taxes to run a deficit that the Administration has no intention of paying back during the strong part of a business cycle. As a corollary, it does rule out passing tax cuts with explicit sunset provisions and then arguing to extend them with the budget not in balance … Twice a year, the Administration makes an economic forecast to underlie the budget or its mid-session review. I&#8217;d be surprised if you ever see such a forecast that predicts an upcoming recession. That means that every budget or mid-session review should be projecting on-budget surpluses or their quick resumption if we are just coming out of a recession. As I&#8217;ve discussed elsewhere, the &#8220;cut the deficit in half in five years&#8221; policy was at variance with this standard … Taxing someone in 2020 to pay for our spending binge in 2003 violates my notions of fairness, and that is a substantially more salient issue here than any additional concerns about efficiency.</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, the actual fiscal policy stances of the Bush Administration are not consistent with how Dr. Samwick would have advised the President.  Perhaps the internal advice that Glenn Hubbard and Greg Mankiw gave President Bush were roughly consistent with how Andrew Samwick would have advised the President.  If so, the President clearly ignored his CEA.  Which raises the question as to why these two gentlemen did not resign sooner? </p>
<p>One note to Andrew Samwick on this excellent post &#8211; I suspect the sources you link are very good ones, but when I tried to reference them, the links were not working properly.</p>

                                <p>The latest from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 132,000 in June, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.5 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Employment rose in several service-providing industries, while manufacturing employment continued to decline. Average hourly earnings rose by 6 cents, or 0.3 percent, over the month.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Household Survey actually reports an employment increase equal to 197,000, which increased the employment to population ratio from 63% to 63.1% &#8211; which kept the unemployment rate steady even as the labor force participation rate edged up.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=07&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=decent_job_growth_bad_producti">Dean Baker</a> reports a few details:</p>
<blockquote><p>The June jobs numbers came in somewhat better than expected largely due to the government adding 40,000 jobs. The health care sector accounted for 42,300 of the 92,000 jobs created by the private sector. Over the last three months the health care sector has accounted for 131,000 of the 345,000 jobs created by the private sector or 38 percent. The better than expected job growth implies another quarter of weak productivity growth. With hours growing at a 2.3 percent annual rate, productivity for the quarter will be approximately 1.0 percent if GDP comes in near the consensus forecast. That means that we will have had three full years with average productivity growth of less than 1.5 percent. This has to raise serious questions about whether the post-1995 productivity upturn has come to an end.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2007/07/june-employment-report.html">CalculatedRisk</a> looks at employment growth since President Bush took office as well as employment in the residential construction and retail employment sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19630959">AP</a> covers the latest from the BLS and wants you to believe that wages are rising:</p>
<blockquote><p>The latest picture of the nation’s employment climate, released by the Labor Department on Friday, also showed that workers saw solid gains in their wages last month &#8230; Workers saw modest wage gains in June.  Average hourly earning rose to $17.38, a 0.3 percent increase from May. That matched the rise anticipated by economists. Over the last 12 months, wages grew by 3.9 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>So were these “solid gains” or “modest wage gains”?  A 3.9 percent increase over a year might sound nice until one realizes that AP is talking about nominal increases.  Our graph shows average hourly earnings of production workers in constant dollar (1982) terms, that is, in real terms.  Notice something.  In May 2007, the real wage was $8.26 – which was the same as the real wage as of September 2002.  Over this period, real wages have varied. During periods when inflation exceeded nominal wages increases, the reported real wage declined.  For other periods, the nominal wage increase actually did exceed inflation so the reported real wage increased.  So with real wages so a lot of variability but no particular trend, why is AP trying to convince us workers are better off.  Did they outsource their reporting to Lawrence Kudlow?  </p>

<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2007/07/06/fed-may-be-questioning-labor-market-tightness">Greg Ip</a> cites Janet Yellen and a few other smart folks suggesting that the labor market is not all that tight:</p>
<blockquote><p>But there are signs the labor market isn’t as tight as the low unemployment rate suggests. One reason is the absence of a notable acceleration in wage growth. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in June from May and were up 3.9% from a year earlier, in line with the rate of growth for the past year. The more comprehensive employment cost index grew 3.5% from the previous year in the first quarter, in the range of the past several years. Broader measures of compensation accelerated in the first quarter, but that may reflect the vagaries of employee stock options and one-time bonuses &#8230; Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Janet Yellen, in a speech delivered via video conference to the Risk Management Institute of Singapore early Friday local time, said, it’s possible “labor markets may not actually be particularly tight,” citing the restrained growth in employment costs &#8230; The low unemployment rate reflects in part a recent drop in the “participation rate” &#8211; the share of working-age people either on the job or looking for work &#8211; from 66.4% in December to 66% in May. It edged back to 66.1% in June. Much of the drop in the participation rate has been among teenagers; contrary to the Fed’s expectation, the participation rate of older workers has actually risen. Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, noted the participation rate has fallen especially sharply for young people, blacks and Hispanics, groups who are “especially sensitive to the economy’s ups and downs.” If those missing workers were reported as unemployed, the jobless rate would be 5% instead of 4.5%, he said in a report.</p></blockquote>
<p>We should note that the discussion of labor compensation was in terms of nominal growth with real growth being near zero.  We should also that the employment-population ratio 64.4% at the end of 2006 and is only 63.1% now.  Finally, we should give hat tips to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/labor-force-par.html">Mark Thoma</a> and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/how-close-are-w.html">Brad DeLong</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update III</strong>:  Go figure &#8211; <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZGQzNzg4YjNhNGU1OThmMzhjMzdjNWFhYjQ2ZjViOGQ=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> thinks the labor market is great:</p>
<blockquote><p>Year-to-year wages for non-management workers increased 3.9 percent. Comparing that with the 2.3 percent increase in the headline inflation personal consumer deflator (for May, the latest month) leaves about 1.5 percent improvement in real wages. The unemployment rate remains at a historically low 4.5 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Kudlow does not realize that the employment to population ratio has declined over the past six months – but that labor force participation rate has also declined.  Incidentally, could someone tell this National Review nitwit that the unemployment rate has been much lower than 4.5%?  Heck &#8211; it was below 4% towards the end of the Clinton years.  And that wasn&#8217;t even near the historical low.  </p>
<p>Sure real wages in May 2007 were higher than that really low $8.17 (1982$) figure for May 2006.  But real wages in May 2007 were no higher than they were as of September 2002.  Leave it Kudlow the Klown to confuse what is noise with what is NOT an upward trend.</p>
<p><strong>Update IV</strong>: <a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-commerce/2007/7/6/economy-booming-so-what-might-start-the-next-recession.html">James Pethokoukis</a> outdoes even Kudlow for dumbest comment on wages:</p>
<blockquote><p>Real wages for workers &#8211; not managers &#8211; increased by 3.9 percent, year over year. Deflate by the core May inflation rate of 2.3 percent &#8211; the latest numbers available &#8211; and you get real wage growth of 1.6 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Real wage growth minus inflation equals real wage growth.  James?  That is really stupid.  No, nominal wages grew by 3.9%.  The rest seems to be a cut and paste from Kudlow’s Korner Krap.  Both of you – consumer prices from May to May grew by over 2.6%.  I checked the BLS data for the period from July 1979 to July 1980.  Nominal wages during the year rose by 7.86% but consumer prices rose by 13.13% over the same period.  But here’s the rub.  Consumer prices did not change from June 1980 to July 1980.  So this Kudlow-Pethokoukis calculus would have suggested a large real wage increase for a period where real wages fell. <em>Brilliant!</em></p>
