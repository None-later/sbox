                                <p>An article about famine in the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/maude-barlow/africa-drought_b_936262.html" target="_blank">Horn of Africa by Maude Barlow</a> appeared today. It is worth your consideration. (h/t coberly)  My own response is in comments.  Following are excerpts:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<br />Most Westerners see the crisis in the Horn of Africa as a combination of a large population, chronic poverty, corruption on the part of African government officials, failed states and no rain, and that none of this will ever change so giving money to this self perpetuating crisis is throwing it away. But I offered another narrative that I believe is closer to the truth.</p>
<p>I believe the water and food crises in the Horn of Africa are the direct result of old-fashioned colonial exploitation: land grabs by foreign hedge and investment funds and wealthy countries setting up large foreign-based agribusinesses that are guzzling the lion&#8217;s share of the water resources and using them to grow crops and biofuels for export and drive up speculation.<br />
<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<br />&#8230;<br />
<br />Foreign acquisitions are forcing small farmers and peasants off the land depriving them of access to food and water. The food and water of the region is being used for export for profit and not being used for local people. As a result, food prices in the region have gone up 200 per cent in less than a year and the price of water has risen 300 per cent. The foreign minister of Ethiopia defends his government&#8217;s actions with the neo-liberal explanation that these foreign &#8220;investments&#8221; will make the country wealthy enough that it can stop producing food and start buying it on the world market.<br />
<br />&#8230;<br />
<br />But exactly the opposite is happening when you drain the land of its water, as is being done by this agribusiness industry, and the rains stop coming. The drought is directly related to both climate change and the resulting desertification of a land stripped of its water sources. Here is what is essential to know: deserts can arise because humans treat land and water badly.<br />
<br />&#8230;<br />
<br />Desertification is taking place in over 100 countries in the world, as we strip the land of land-based water from aquifers and rivers, sending it to thirsty mega-cities (who dump it untreated into oceans), or using it to grow food and other goods for the world market, where it is transported out of local watersheds in the form of &#8220;virtual water exports.&#8221; </p></blockquote>

<div></div>
<div>A while ago (an understatement) I posted on the question of what is rich. The <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/04/define-rich.html">first dealt</a> with what issues to consider in defining rich. The <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/05/define-rich-part-ii-rat-race-and.html">second</a> was looking at the issue of getting rich if that is even what one wants to do. The “rat race”. I don&#8217;t believe most people really want to be rich. I believe most people when thinking about being rich are thinking about what it would take to remove the fears of events that would make one&#8217;s life either very difficult in a world that requires money to remove risk or drastically different from what one&#8217;s life was. I&#8217;m thinking things like losing a job, debilitating injury or illness possibly resulting in physical disability or Louis Winthorpe III. </div>
<div></div>
<div>This all ties into “The American Dream”. The “Dream” is not just an ideology of governance and social philosophy. It is also a life style and thus requires a specific level of income. I have posted on this issue also and noted just how high in income we have driven this “Dream” such that two people with bachelor’s degrees just starting life together may not be able to have it. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Now that we have entered a period where taxes are on everyone&#8217;s minds such that there is serious consensus to raising taxes, maybe we need to see what we had in the past to know what we need now. I am sure most readers are aware of Mike&#8217;s work defining what rates appear to effect economic growth the best. If I recall correctly the number for the top 1% was around 65%. I have also suggested that there is a range as to how large a share of the income the top 1% should have. That number for the top 1% is not to be above 15% and not to much below 10%. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I should also <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/opus-1-discussion-on-taxation.html">mention my postings</a> on <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/01/opus-1-second-movement-on-taxation.html">taxation’s purpose</a>. Specifically I looked at taxing from the perspective of the legal profession as oppose to the economic profession. The conclusion was that there was one main reason for taxing. It is to fulfill the directive of our constitution: equality of power. It is to assure the concept of one voice one vote. If there was ever a time in our history to raise taxes in order to assure this directive it is now in the age of the Citizens United ruling. President FDR referred to the issue and those with the one voice multiple votes do to their monied power as “economic royalty”. I like that phrase and I wonder why it is not used as are retort to those who use “class warfare” as a guilt trip.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s get started.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />I have constructed 4 sets of data using the tax rates of 1936/37, 1945/46, 1965/67 and 2010. I chose 1936 because it is a tax rate increase after the economy had turned north based on Mikes posting. I chose 1945/46 because it is another adjustment that happens right after after WWII. I chose 1965/67 because it is the decrease often spoken of fondly. Of course 2010 is because that is where we are at. 
<div></div>
<div>This posting would be hugely long if I post on all 4 periods at once, so I have broken it up. Let me first and I think most importantly note that we people today have no idea just how much we were willing to tax ourselves to have the society that we now refer to as “the good old days”. Not only did we have the tax tables of 1936, that table eventually had a 10% surcharge added to pay for the war. Yes, another reason to consider the generation that fought the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> world wars the greatest generation. There was a 7% surcharge for the Vietnam war, though that number became less as time passed. Still, we knew that if we wanted to do exceptional things, we had to tax ourselves exceptionally. Also, the early taxation made no distinction for single or married, never mind filing joint or separate. Everyone paid the same rate. Most interestingly, with the current table, the people who comparatively get screwed are those who are married and file separately. All the rates kick in at a lower income than even those who are single. The other thing we don&#8217;t seem to understand is that all the tax rhetoric we have been hearing since Reagan <a href="http://taxhistory.tax.org/www/website.nsf/Web/THM1901?OpenDocument">we&#8217;ve heard before virtually to the word.</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>Andrew Mellon, Treasury Secretary 1921 to 1932 :</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Generally speaking, Mellon argued that tax burdens were too high. Steep rates, he insisted, served only to stifle incentive and foster tax evasion. “Any man of energy and initiative in this country can get what he wants out of life,” he wrote. <em>“But when initiative is crippled by legislation or by a tax system which denies him the right to receive a reasonable share of his earnings, then he will no longer exert himself and the country will be deprived of the energy on which its continued greatness depends.”</em></div>
<div></div>
<div>Worse yet, Mellon argued, high rates didn’t even raise money. By encouraging both legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion, they eroded the tax base and reduced overall revenue. <em>Lower rates, he said, would actually raise money by spurring economic growth and reducing the incentive for tax avoidance. “It seems difficult for some to understand,” he complained, “that high rates of taxation do not necessarily mean large revenue to the government, and that more revenue may actually be obtained by lower rates.”</em> In particular, Mellon insisted that high rates distorted investment decisions, boosting the popularity of tax-free state and local government bonds. Indeed, Mellon made these tax-free bonds a regular target of his reform attempts, but Congress resisted his plans to eliminate them.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Atlas Shrugged wasn&#8217;t even written then!  What we don&#8217;t hear much of are the original concerns and reasoning for progressive taxation. Teddy Roosevelt:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>1906&#8230;<strong>We should discriminate in the sharpest way between fortunes well-won and fortunes ill-won; between those gained as an incident to performing great services to the community as a whole, and those gained in evil fashion by keeping just within the limits of mere law-honesty.</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>1907 regarding an income tax:&#8230;while in addition it is a difficult tax to administer in its practical working, and great care would have to be exercised to see that it was not evaded by the very men whom it was most desirable to have taxed, for if so evaded it would, of course, be worse than no tax at all; <strong>as the least desirable of all taxes is the tax which bears heavily upon the honest as compared with the dishonest man. </strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>No advantage comes either to the country as a whole or to the individuals inheriting the money by permitting the transmission in their entirety of the enormous fortunes which would be affected by such a tax; and as an incident to its function of revenue raising, such a tax would help to preserve a measurable equality of opportunity for the people of the generations growing to manhood.</strong> We have not the slightest sympathy with that socialistic idea which would try to put laziness, thriftlessness and inefficiency on a par with industry, thrift and efficiency; which would strive to break up not merely private property, but what is far more important, the home, the chief prop upon which our whole civilization stands. Such a theory, if ever adopted, would mean the ruin of the entire country&#8211;a ruin  which would bear heaviest upon the weakest, upon those least able to shift for themselves.</div>

<div>At this moment, I want to mention corporate taxes. There are lessons to be learned from it&#8217;s history. I think it is a factor in understand more completely the issue Mike is focusing on: taxation and GDP growth. <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=203">Wrap your minds around the fact</a> that from 1936 to 1943 there were 6 years that corporate tax collections were greater than personal income tax collections. 1943 was the best year for this as personal income tax collections were 68.1% of the corporate tax collections. Just one year later it flips to corporate tax collections being 75.3% of personal income tax collections. In 1944 $34,543 million in total for the two taxes was collected vs 1943 $16,062 million in total.  <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=204">In fact, personal income taxes</a> remain in the mid to high 40 percent of total revenue collections from 1944 to present. The corporate share of total revenue peaks in 1943 at 39.8% and declines to hover around the 10% level with a few ventures into the single digits. Most notably 1983 the corporate share was 6.2% and 2009 it was 6.6%. </div>
<div>First up is our current tax table. I used the “married filling jointly” as that would be consistent with the other tables. One big rule of this series of postings: DO NOT concern yourself or me about the deductions that exist. They do not matter for this presentation and for all intent and purposes we can consider the income to have already gone through the deduction calculator and is now ready to have the tax table applied. This is because, these tables only apply to adjusted gross income.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lX4293efG5Y/Tl_Efh3ab1I/AAAAAAAAARc/W7X0lIr0Ki0/s1600/2010+Tax+table+Define+Rich+3.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="211" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lX4293efG5Y/Tl_Efh3ab1I/AAAAAAAAARc/W7X0lIr0Ki0/s320/2010+Tax+table+Define+Rich+3.JPG" width="320" xaa="true"></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>You will notice that the table is calculated out to $,1,000,000 of income. I did this in order to keep all the tables going to the same income level. The 1936 table actually has rates for incomes up to $8 million. That is $8 million in 1936. (Using my <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/compare/">favorite money converter</a> that would be $301,000,000 in unskilled labor or $573,000,000 in GDP/capita.) Going to $1,000,000 in income also allows one to see what happens at the top when the rate no longer rises. </div>
<div></div>
<div>A very important concept to understand is that not every dollar is taxed at the single percentage rate as you go up the income ladder. Thus, there are two columns in my charts. The “Marginal Tax” is the additional money paid at the top of the bracket for the corresponding rate. The “Total tax” is the actual money paid up to that level. It is the “effective rate”. In simple terms, if you are at the 35% level, you  </div>
<div>are not paying 35% on all that you earn. Instead you are paying the amount based on your income being divided up into the number of brackets that exist. For 2010, there are 6 brackets, thus you have six different incomes so to speak. </div>
<div></div>
<div>This is what it looks like as a graph.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OCqtKMLzE3A/Tl_Ejt_NFtI/AAAAAAAAARg/bwU8IixjaGc/s1600/2010+Tax+rate+graph+Define+Rich+3.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OCqtKMLzE3A/Tl_Ejt_NFtI/AAAAAAAAARg/bwU8IixjaGc/s320/2010+Tax+rate+graph+Define+Rich+3.JPG" width="320" xaa="true"></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>When the rate maxed out, I divided the range to $1 million into even parts so that the tax paid for each additional income level is the same. For the 1945/46 and 1965/67 data sets I converted the net income to 2010 dollars. I used the “unskilled labor” and GDP/cap as those are the 2 factors suggested as being the best for knowing what income equivalents are over time. The 1936 data set is converted to 1967 dollar because the numbers just get crazy. For example, a net income of $3840 is $145,000 in unskilled labor and $275,000 in GDP/cap. Though it is only $60,400 via the CPI. Which doesn&#8217;t say much for today&#8217;s median family income. It also gives us a clue as to just how much money is considered “rich”.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Next posting, I will start presenting the historical data sets. I&#8217;m still thinking about the best way to do it as what is important is the comparison among the data sets.  Maybe post just the data charts and later the graphs or maybe one data set and it&#8217;s graphs at a time.  </div>

                                <p>Busy day on several fronts, but these should be discussed and I&#8217;ve already <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/sheer-idiocy-european-and-american.html">posted one rant</a> this week, so a riff on the second piece would be overkill. Sort of an Open Thread, with four topics.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tyler Cowen argues that, instead of giving out stimulus monies, <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/08/how-ineffective-was-the-stimulus-really.html">the government should just hire people directly</a>. No, really:<br />

<p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s say seventy percent of the stimulus gets spent on labor at all, and only forty-two percent of that gets spent on unemployed labor&#8230;.That’s less than thirty percent of the initial expenditure being spent on unemployed labor and that is before any other problems with the expenditures kick in.  It’s hard for me to see that as a triumph of the program (NB: we are only talking about one part of ARRA here); would direct government employment have overhead costs that high?</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<br />UPDATE: Matt Yglesias <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/08/31/309145/mercatus-study-confirms-arras-success/">comes the same conclusion I did</a>: that the Jones and Rothschild study advocates &#8220;a targeted make-work program for unemployed people.&#8221;  And Mike Konczal does the definitive takedown of pretending the study reads as anything other than that <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/did-the-arra-hire-the-unemployed-or-just-shift-jobs-around-the-employed/">ARRA was successful and too small</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>Anyone who thinks that S&#038;P will be in business five years from now should <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-31/subprime-mortgage-bonds-getting-aaa-rating-s-p-denies-to-u-s-treasuries.html">read this piece</a>.  Not even the market is stupid enough to believe that house prices cannot decline 5%, or that the costs of payment delays and the like will not eat the &#8220;value&#8221; of these securities.  That&#8217;s not unique; what has changed is that investors <em>are saying so</em>.
</li>
<li>Marshall Auerback suggests that <a href="http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2011/08/tale-of-three-germanys-is-germany.html">Germany may be preparing to exit the Euro</a>.  My rough sketches suggest that&#8217;s a bad idea for their banks, but it might do their companies some good.  As he notes, &#8220;[his] <a href="http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2011/05/to-save-euro-germany-has-to-quit.html">view</a>, which was once considered borderline crazy, is now getting more serious consideration.&#8221;
</li>
<li>Everyone who claimed that Jon Huntsman is a &#8220;sensible, sane Republican&#8221; <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2011/08/31/309249/huntsman-taxes-rich/">owes the rest of us a sackcloth-and-ashes level apology</a>. Anyone who still does it is a pawn or an idiot.</li>

                                <p>It&#8217;s rare to see <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-30/european-banking-group-seeks-to-scale-back-basel-capital-surcharge-plans.html">theft described so directly</a>:<br />
 <br />
<blockquote>Proposals made in July by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision should be redrafted to allow banks to use so-called contingent capital to meet the obligations, the European Banking Federation said in a letter seen by Bloomberg News. They should also be changed so <strong><em>lenders that can’t meet the requirements don’t immediately face restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and bonuses</em></strong>, the EBF said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stringing up a few EBF bankers is seeming more and more like a calm, rational approach to solving their issues. Especially when even <em>investors</em> are <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/08/30/uk-eba-idUKTRE77T29V20110830">calling out their lies</a>:<br />
 <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;European banks are in the deepest hole of all. Over the past five years, the European financial sector has shed 900 billion euros in capitalisation and two thirds of its value,&#8221; said Jacques Chahine, chairman of European investment firm J.Chahine Capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the sector has raised 450 billion euros in capital over the same period, this has clearly been inadequate to cover increased risk on sovereign debt. We believe banks will have to be recapitalised by an additional 450 billion euros to cover that risk,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The response from the European Banking Authority is less than encouraging:<br />
 <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The stress test recently conducted by the EBA showed that EU banks have significantly strengthened their capital positions and are able to withstand adverse macroeconomic scenarios, a view not changed by the additional disclosure of sovereign exposures,&#8221; it said&#8230;.<br />
 <br /><a name="more"></a><br />
 <br />&#8220;The main EU banks have significantly strengthened their liquidity buffers, lengthened the maturity profile of their liabilities and covered most of their funding needs for 2011. However, going forward <strong>it will be important that normal access to medium and long-term funding markets is restored</strong>,&#8221; the EBA said. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, so long as it&#8217;s not an <em>immediate</em> crisis, everything is hunky-dory. Ignore <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2011/082711.htm">that woman running the IMF</a>.</p>
<p>Lest you think I&#8217;m only bashing Europeans—a role usually left to <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/">Rebecca</a>, who uses their data, not their words—let&#8217;s <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/banking-budgeting/article/110218/the-biggest-lie-about-us-companies">also look at the glories of U.S. corporations</a>. I&#8217;m taking the more delicate quotes here, just so you don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve gone all <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/">Mish</a>:<br />
 <br />
<blockquote>Central bank and Commerce Department data reveal that gross domestic debts of nonfinancial corporations now amount to 50% of GDP. That&#8217;s a postwar record. In 1945, it was just 20%. Even at the credit-bubble peaks in the late 1980s and 2005-06, it was only around 45%.</p>
<p>The Fed data &#8220;underline the poor state of the U.S. private sector&#8217;s balance sheets,&#8221; reports financial analyst Andrew Smithers, who&#8217;s also the author of &#8220;Wall Street Revalued: Imperfect Markets and Inept Central Bankers,&#8221; and chairman of Smithers &#038; Co. in London.</p>
<p>&#8220;While this is generally recognized for households,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it is often denied with regard to corporations. <strong>These denials are without merit and depend on looking at cash assets and ignoring liabilities.</strong> Cash assets have risen recently, in response to the fall in inventories, but nonfinancials&#8217; corporate debt, whether measured gross or after netting off bank deposits and other interest-bearing assets, is at peak levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>By Smithers&#8217; analysis, net leverage is nearly 50% of corporate net worth, a modern record. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>This should come as no surprise. The lie coming out of KocherlakotaLand in early 2008 was that since companies drawing down on previously-unneeded-and-therefore-unused lines of credit was evidence <a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp666.pdf">that we were not in a recession</a> [warning: PDF the reading of which will damage your brain; superstitious Christians should note the Working Paper Number].</p>
<p>Now, those same borrowings, along with capital market moves, are being used to show that companies have &#8220;record cash holdings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Borrowing money without having a use for it is good in two circumstances: (1) if you are paying down higher-cost debt [oops, that&#8217;s a use] and (2) if the carry is positive (that is, if you can earn more than you are being charged in interest&#8211;oops, that&#8217;s a use, too).</p>
<p>If families worked like European banks, we would all be taking vacations and spending like there is no tomorrow. If they worked like American corporations, they would be borrowing money and boasting about how much cash they have on hand.</p>
<p>Can we now stuff the sh*t about how &#8220;governments have to work like families&#8221;? Corporations—and most especially financial services intermediaries—certainly do not.</p>

                                <p>Yesterday the <a href="http://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm">Conference Board released</a> its measure of consumer confidence, which dropped to 44.5 in August. This brings the Conference Board measure of confidence in line with the <a href="http://thomsonreuters.com/content/financial/pdf/i_and_a/438965/economic_downturn_expected_by_consumers.jpg">Reuters/University of Michigan</a> measure of consumer sentiment. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-30/u-s-consumer-confidence-drops-to-lowest-since-09-as-index-slumps-to-44-5.html">Bloomberg </a>summarizes the Conference Board results.</p>
<p>Confidence is important, since consumer spending accounts for the lion&#8217;s-share of aggregate spending. Consumer confidence measures are highly correlated with the annual growth in real personal consumption expenditures &#8211; the correlation coefficients are 75% and 67% for the University of Michigan Sentiment index and the Conference Board&#8217;s Confidence index, respectively.</p>

<br />To date, while July real wages and salaries (deflated using the CPI) fell on the month, the 3-month average continues its ascent. Clearly the sluggish climb in real wages and salaries is not enough to spark a surge in confidence and spending. Neither will consumers draw down saving, as was the case over the last decade amid debt-financed consumption. In fact, <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?s%5B1%5D%5Bid%5D=PSAVERT">saving is more likely to rise as a share of income</a> than fall as the balance sheet repair process furthers.</p>
<p>Jobs and incomes will drive consumption.</p>
<p>To be sure, measures of confidence <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/06/frbsf-consumer.html">are &#8220;better&#8221; predictors of economic activity when the economy is fragile</a>. We know that the economy is now <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/q2-us-gdp-report-just-terrible.html">much more fragile than previously thought</a>. Weak confidence plus meager real wage and salary growth is, unfortunately, a harbinger of further &#8216;weak&#8217; economic activity.<br /></p>

                                <p>Since Sunday noon till about Tuesday 6 pm had no power.  The live high voltage wire downed along with two trees prevented cars coming or going for the duration of days, so helped spur reflection on neighbors, basic water needs and food stuffs, and in some cases emergencies (not our area).  Still, fire and ambulance vehicle access was blocked because going around was not possible.</p>
<p>You would be amazed that people&#8217;s catchphrases for home wifi are forgotten, including where the printed version was hidden.  Even the local starbucks and wifi was down.  Ken could fill us in the the lack of running water I believe.  </p>

<p>This post is the third in a series that looks at the relationship between real economic growth and the top individual marginal tax rate.  The first looked at the period from 1901 to 1928, the second from 1929 to 1940.  This one will look at the period from 1940 to 1950.  </p>
<p>Before I begin, a quick recap&#8230;  both the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1901 &#8211; 1928 period</a> and the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_22.html">1929 &#8211; 1940</a> [link fixed] failed to show the textbook relationship between taxes and growth.  In fact, it seems that for both those periods, there was at least a bit of support for the notion that growth was faster in periods of rising tax rates than in periods when tax rates were coming down.  There were also a few other findings that might be surprising &#8211; the so-called Roaring 20s were a period in which the economy was often in recession.  The New Deal era, on the other hand, coincided with some of the fastest economic growth rates this country has seen since reliable data has been kept.  As we will see in this post, the period from 1940 to 1950, encompassing WW2 as well as the immediate post-war recovery, also is subject to a lot of popular misconceptions. </p>
<p>Real GDP figures used in this post come from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis.</a>  Top individual marginal tax rate figures used in this post come from the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a>.  As in previous posts, I’m using growth rate from one year to the next (e.g., the 1980 figure shows growth from 1980 to 1981) to avoid “what leads what” questions. If there is a causal relationship between the tax rate and the growth rate, the growth rate from 1980 to 1981 cannot be causing the 1980 tax rate.<br />
<br />The following graph shows the growth rate in real GDP from one year to the next (black line) and the top marginal tax rate (gray bars) for the period from 1940 to 1950.<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
<br />Finally, in the fourth decade we looked at in this series so far, we see a graph that doesn&#8217;t contradict textbook economics:  growth seems to slow down as tax rates rise, reaching its lowest point (on the graph) when tax rates peaked.  Then, after tax rates begin to fall, growth picks up again.   So why do we see this negative correlation between tax rates and subsequent growth rates during the 1940 to 1950 period when we saw the opposite in the previous periods? </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Well, as I&#8217;ve pointed out many times in the past, there is a quadratic relationship between tax rates and subsequent growth rates (kind of like the Laffer curve, but with real GDP growth taking the place of tax collections), and the fastest growth tends to occur when the top marginal rate is <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/optimal-tax-rates-for-generating.html">somewhere around 65%</a>.  (At this juncture I have to point out things can be true whether we like them or not.  If you&#8217;re looking for a micro-foundations reason why raising tax rates can create faster economic growth, try <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/simple-explanation-for-strange-paradox.html">this</a>.)  </p>
<p>In any case, tax rates in 1940 were at 79%, and they reached a high of 94% in 1944 and 1945.  Clearly, at 79% the top marginal tax rates were already above optimum, and raising them simply moved them even farther away from the optimum growth rate.  Conversely, cutting tax rates down to the low 80% following the end of WW2 moved tax rates closer to optimum.</p>
<p>But growth does not live by tax rates alone and the graph above hints at a few other misconceptions.  Let&#8217;s start with a big one shared by folks on the left and the right, namely that World War 2 led to faster economic growth.  In fact, many folks go so far as to say the economy suffered very slow growth until the outbreak of WW2, which as we saw in the last post in the series, is a comical claim.   The graph below shows growth rates from 1938 to 1944.  (Remember &#8211; for our purposes, growth is from t to t+1&#8230; thus, growth in 1938 is the percentage change between the 1938 real GDP and the 1939 real GDP.)  As with Figure 2 in the previous post, the best ever year of the Reagan administration is also included for comparison purposes.<br />
</p>
<p>
<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BSznfwpPjUg/TlvZjpm0CPI/AAAAAAAAAg4/bah0HtIGSyo/s1600/Figure%2B2%2B-%2B1940%2B-%2B1950.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BSznfwpPjUg/TlvZjpm0CPI/AAAAAAAAAg4/bah0HtIGSyo/s320/Figure%2B2%2B-%2B1940%2B-%2B1950.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />
</p>
<p>
<br />Notice&#8230;  growth was already fairly quick from 1938 to 1939, and from 1939 to 1940&#8230; and then it really jumped from 1940 to 1941.  Pearl Harbor was December 7, 1941, so most of that latter jump came before the American entry into the war.  Now, one might say that somewhere around 1938 was the beginning of US involvement in WW2, what with Liberty Ships and the Arsenal of Democracy and all.  Put another way, that big jump in growth came before the US was in the war, but as an administration whose policies had already generated several years of very rapid growth since 1933 took an increasing role in the economy.  Apparently the economic policies followed were good enough to overcome even tax rates that were significantly above optimum.</p>
<p>Growth peaked between 1941 and 1942 and then began to shrink.  In part, as we saw, that was because tax rates got too far above optimum.  In part, on the other hand, it is because too much of the country&#8217;s labor pool was shipped abroad to fight in the war.   But regardless&#8230; if the war had been a catalyst for jumpstarting the economy, the peak would not have occurred when it did&#8230; and growth would not have started accelerating so many years before the country&#8217;s entry into the war..  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s one more myth that is worth tackling.  That myth is that there was some sort of stupendous economic boom following WW2.  And it only makes sense that there would be such a boom &#8211; the GIs came home, tax rates were cut in 1946 and again in 1948, government spending dropped, and rationing and price controls went by the wayside.  And as Figure 1 shows, real GDP had a post-war nadir (I always wanted to use that word!!!) in 1947, and recovered after that.  But it is important to put that recovery into context.  </p>
<p>The graph below shows the rate of growth from 1947 (the bottom) to 1950 &#8211; the post-war miracle, as it were &#8211; and it compares it to the rate of growth from 1933 (the bottom of the Great Depression) to 1936, the heart of the New Deal.<br />
</p>
<p>
<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PuRXzVhsmcQ/TlvZxhmzTYI/AAAAAAAAAhA/J3YLvvrIp8c/s1600/Figure%2B3%2B-%2B1940%2B-%2B1950.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PuRXzVhsmcQ/TlvZxhmzTYI/AAAAAAAAAhA/J3YLvvrIp8c/s320/Figure%2B3%2B-%2B1940%2B-%2B1950.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />
</p>
<p>
<br />As Figure 3 shows, there really is no comparison between the two recoveries.  Whereas during the post war recovery, the economy grew almost 13% over three years following the bottom, it grew almost three times faster following the bottom in 1933.  And from the previous post, we saw what happened during the rest of the 1930s.  We&#8217;ll see what followed the post-War recovery in the next post on this series. </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/sunday-review/dissecting-why-the-fed-does-what-it-does.html?pagewanted=2&#038;_r=2&#038;ref=opinion">This article</a> by David Leonhardt in the New York Times is getting a lot of attention.</p>
<p>Leonhardt argues that there is an active debate in the economics profession between inflation hawks, moderates and doves and that only the position of hawks and moderates are represented on the Fed open market committee (FOMC).  He guesses that Perry&#8217;s equating dovishness with treason (now for monetary policy too) might be part of the problem.</p>
<p>I personally have a strong objection to Leonhardt&#8217;s article.  He lumps together people who think that the Fed should not cause higher inflation with people who think that the Fed can&#8217;t cause higher inflation.  </p>
<blockquote><p>IF you were to conduct a survey of the country’s top economists, you would find a fair number who did not believe that the Federal Reserve should be taking more aggressive steps to help the economy. Some would worry that injecting more money into the economy might unnerve global investors or set off uncontrollable inflation. Others would wonder whether, with interest rates already so low, the Fed even had much power to lift economic growth.</p>
<p>But you would also find a sizable group of economists who thought the Fed could and should do far more than it was doing. This group, known as doves, tilts liberal, though it includes conservatives as well. If anything, it can probably claim a larger number of big-name economists — J. Bradford DeLong, Paul Krugman (an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times), Christina D. Romer, Scott Sumner and Mark Thoma, among others — than the camp that believes the Fed has done too much.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that the group that think that the Fed doesn&#8217;t have much power to lift economic growth are lost somewhere between the two paragraphs.  Leonhardt goes on to present the debate between DeLong et al on one side and FOMC hawks &#8220;Richard W. Fisher of Dallas, Narayana R. Kocherlakota of Minneapolis and Charles I. Plosser of Philadelphia.&#8221; with the moderates such as Bernanke in the mushy middle.  </p>
<p>The hawks and those who doubt that the Fed can cause higher inflation absolutely disagree.  The hawks say there is a risk of higher inflation.  DeLong says higher inflation is possible and would be good.  They agree on the first question and then disagree about the effects of inflation and the relative importance of economic catastrophe and whatever costs 4% inflation would have (small to minimal according to top conservative academics like uh Kocherlakota).</p>
<p>I<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/can-the-fed-increase-inflation/2011/08/26/gIQA1iEIgJ_blog.html?wprss=ezra-klein">t is just not true that no prominent FOMC nominee Nobel Laureate has expressed doubt as to whether the Fed can cause higher inflation</a>.  Leonhardt seems to have decided that Peter Diamond just doesn&#8217;t exist (or to agree with Sen Shelby that he doesn&#8217;t know about money &#8212; I might add that top academic N. Kocherlakota&#8217;s research on money is all based on Peter Diamond&#8217;s search model).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the sense that Romer and Krugman firmly disagree with those who think the Fed can&#8217;t do much more.  They call for more more more, but don&#8217;t IIRC express confidence that anything the Fed might do would have a really big effect.  Conflating the questions of should the Fed try to cause higher inflation and can the Fed achieve it makes them definitely doves.  That&#8217;s why I object to the conflation.</p>
<p>Before the jump I note (again) that I think the Fed could do more which would be useful &#8212; buy risky assets (via Maiden Lane III if necessary).  But that means I absolutely don&#8217;t agree with people who call for QEIII and look at the quantity and not the quality or who think that saying more inflation would be nice would have much effect or who call for targeting nominal GDP (why not jut &#8220;target&#8221; real GDP and cut out the middle man ?).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>By the way Leonhardt forgets about Diamond also when making the obligatory claim that both parties share blame &#8220;The Obama administration has also been slow to fill some Fed openings. At least one of the 12 seats has been vacant since Mr. Obama took office, and two are now.&#8221; as Leonhardt knows perfectly well, the Obama administration can&#8217;t fill Fed openings if Republican senators filibuster votes on nominees.  Obama is not the reason that there are two vacancies, Shelby is.  <a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/2011/08/28/eternal-vigilance-2/">Hat tip Tom Levenson</a></p>
<p>On the other hand the article does contain news for anyone who thinks that Scott Sumner is reality based.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Sumner has become so dispirited by the Fed that, before leaving on a trip for Italy last week, he left a post on his well-read blog, The Money Illusion, under the headline, &#8220;Not enough.&#8221; The headline, he wrote, &#8220;refers to my reaction if the Fed does something while I&#8217;m gone.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sumner just wrote that he doesn&#8217;t bother to wait to learn the facts, because he already knows the answer.  I knew that was true of him (in general) but you aren&#8217;t supposed to say so.</p>

<p>Tyler Cowen has a post on <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/08/claims-about-north-dakota.html">truck driving jobs in North Dakota</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>My poking around showed that some of them start at 75k a year, though with raises for good performance. </p></blockquote>
<p>The implication, of course &#8211; why don&#8217;t unemployed people move to North Dakota and drive trucks for good wages rather than stick around and collect unemployment?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a theory:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SrYYFirCoRQ/TlpM-7ff9VI/AAAAAAAAAsM/uhQdntf7mxI/s1600/wages.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SrYYFirCoRQ/TlpM-7ff9VI/AAAAAAAAAsM/uhQdntf7mxI/s320/wages.jpg"></a>Figure 1<br />
<br />Screenshot from <a href="http://www.ndworkforceconnection.com/occprofiledata.asp?1=2&#038;ff_occprofile_section_controls=1&#038;ff_occprofile_display_type_numeric=1&#038;context=incontextlmi&#038;session=jobmarkettrends&#038;geo=3801000000&#038;geotype=&#038;city=&#038;zip=&#038;radius=&#038;onetcode=53303200">Job Service North Dakota</a>, run by the State Gov&#8217;t of North Dakota.</p>
<p>Advertised wages for light truck drivers are quite a bit lower ($21,736 for entry level).<br />
<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<br />More generally, I imagine there is a reason why unemployed relatively unskilled people, in, say, Lincoln, Nebraska don&#8217;t go through the expense of moving their families to Bismark and taking the coursework needed to get certified in order to get a job paying $32K a year or to do the equivalent to become a roughneck at a gas boomtown, even ignoring the fact that the jobs pay less than outsiders believe and the costs of taking them are greater. See&#8230; we&#8217;ve been through this before many times. </p>
<p>The boom in the new skillset often ends before the new entrants can recoup their investment in gaining the skillset. And not just for the unskilled. Ask the folks who flocked to Silicon Valley in the 1990s for those great jobs as programmers. I&#8217;m sure you can find someone who drove out to Palo Alto in 1996 who is still programming and making north of $175K to boot but I&#8217;m guessing those people are huge outliers, not the trendline.</p>
<p>Disclosure. I&#8217;m now currently looking for a full time job. Given the severance package I accepted from my previous employer and since I have some consulting work to do, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m neither eligible for unemployment benefits nor able to move to North Dakota to train for an exciting new career hauling cargo.<br /></p>

                                <p>As Rusty presents his short &#8216;thoughts&#8217; on the administrative end of the national healthcare reform process, I noticed some readers have taken the problems he notes as indicative that the whole process is flawed and destructive.  I do believe that is a wrong tack to take and will not serve to learn more of what is happening in the process. The US public has only begun to take note of the growing necessity of deciding not only public spending but the huge costs to the current private system.  Changes are happening in that area as well.</p>
<p>The steadily increasing complexity of insurance billing and particular contracts with groups is simply bypassed in macro discussions but has profound effects on delivery of services and costs.  We glibly point to general &#8216;benefits&#8217; sections of insurance as the &#8216;worth&#8217; of plans and that justify the &#8216;premium&#8217; schedules&#8230;.not the real contracts on the other side of service delivery. Many general public discussions ignore the trends in the private sector. The overall costs of the system itself as the &#8216;cost curve&#8217; bends downward without much general scrutiny will impact more than the handy medicaid and elderly targets in the political discourse..   </p>
<p><strong>Health Care Thoughts:  Regulations Gone Wild</strong></p>
<p>My favorite nurse has been attending in-services and doing some computer seminars on long-term care nursing. She is not happy.<br />
<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<br />She sat down the other evening and put together a list of 15 major regulatory driven changes in procedures and/or documentation. In reviewing the list, she determined that 2 or maybe 3 of the changes will improve the quality of care or the safety of residents.</p>
<p>So what about the rest?</p>
<p>She doubts that changing a 16 step process for administering sterile eye drops to an 18 step process will have much value. If she uses the 16 step process in the presence of a state or federal surveyor the facility would be cited for inadequate care, even though the care is perfect.</p>
<p>And the triplicate procedures for verifying narcotics are ever expanding into four and five step processes repeated multiple times each day (the DEA, having won the war on drugs, has been hounding nursing  homes on paperwork).</p>
<p>Keep in mind a nursing home has much more extensive documentation rules that even an acute care hospital, with less staff. </p>
<p>When business and professional people complain about federal regulations, many academics and left leaning politicians pooh-pooh them as greedy whiners, but in the real world there are real impacts of regulations, not all positive.</p>
