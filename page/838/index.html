                                <p>So how did Chris and Ben Affleck get <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19110556">this one</a> right?</p>
<blockquote><p>AFFLECK:  Giuliani, without a doubt.  Giuliani is by far their toughest candidate.  Giuliani is—I thought he did great in the debate.  I think he has—because he—if he can get through the primaries with some of those liberal views, it‘s harder to pain him as an extremist socially.  I think he‘s well-spoken.  He‘s assertive.  I think he knows how to play to his strength, which is being the kind of—the daddy that protects you when times are hard.  Unfortunately, the way that he does that is by kind of engendering fear in the audience.  But it‘s an extremely effective political tactic, and he‘s very good at it.</p>
<p>MATTHEWS:  I agree. And he never lets us forget 9/11 and never lets us forget the possibility of another terrorist attack, does he.  Ever.</p>
<p>AFFLECK:  No.  And I don‘t think it‘s—frankly, I object to it, but I think just from the macro point of view, it‘s excellent politics.  And if he‘s the only one I think that—from a totally amateur man on the road, what do I know, I‘m just a dumb actor point of view&#8230;</p>
<p>MATTHEWS:  I know.</p>
<p>AFFLECK:  &#8230; I think he‘s the only one who‘s got a shot at it.</p>
<p>MATTHEWS:  And by the way, I disagree with you about you being an amateur.  But I‘ll tell you one thing.  I agree with what Fareed Zakaria wrote in “Newsweek” this week, which is terrorism isn‘t explosions and death, terrorism is when you change your society because of those explosions and you become fearful to the point where you shut out immigration, you shut out student exchanges, you shut people out of buildings, you begin to act in an almost fascist manner because you‘re afraid of what might happen to you.  That‘s when terrorism becomes real and frighteningly successful.  That‘s what I believe, and that‘s why I question the way Giuliani has raised this issue.  He raises it as a specter.  In a weird way, he helps the bad guys.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rudy is a lot like George W. Bush in his spreading fear to justify “daddy government”.  Neither one of them is a conservative in the sense of supporting a limited government.</p>

<blockquote><p>The NYT has a very nice feature in today&#8217;s paper, a calculator that allows you to see how wages have grown over the last four decades. You can make comparisons for a wide variety of demographic characteristics, occupations, and industries. You can even plus your own info in and see how you&#8217;re doing compared to your peers. This is nice,  it&#8217;s giving people real information. That&#8217;s what newspapers are supposed to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree but I have one nitpick with the title which talks about “wealth” whereas the calculator graphs real salaries.  Their instructions continue the error in terminology by calling this salary calculator a “wealth calculator”.  Could someone let the New York Times know that stocks and flows are different concepts.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/06/profit_theory_i.html">Mark Thoma</a> has an interesting post that links to other interesting posts on one aspect of the debate between the neoclassical v. heterodox economics crediting <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2007/06/07/profits-and-loss">Daniel Davies</a> for raising the question noted in my title:</p>
<blockquote><p>The anomaly I’m talking about is that neoclassical economics, in both macro and micro forms, nearly invariably works on the basis of models in which there are no profits.  Since in general, companies do earn profits, I think this is a pretty big problem. Let me add a couple of caveats. Neoclassical economics does allow for “normal profits”, meaning a sufficient surplus of income over expense to repay the cost of financial capital. But this isn’t really profit at all, and it doesn’t describe economic behaviour at all well &#8211; firms which are merely earning their cost of capital certainly don’t in general think that they’re doing as well as can be expected with no room for improvement.  Neoclassical economics also allows for monopoly profits to be earned in situations in which there are legal or practical barriers to entry into industries.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/06/profits.html">Alex Tabarrok</a> brings up the national income accounts and the capital share:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of gross domestic income is wages, about 56%.   Proprietor&#8217;s income and corporate profits are together about 17% but most of proprietor&#8217;s income is really labor income and a good chunk of corporate profits is interest and a return to capital.  In a generous accounting true profits might be 5-10% of gross domestic income &#8211; not zero but not very large either.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alex is referring to table 1.11 of the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">BEA accounts</a>.  Table 1.12 is entitled National Income by Type of Income.  Adding proprietors&#8217; income to compensation of employees – these two items represent 72.3% of national income.  So if Alex is right about proprietors&#8217; income being labor income, the capital share is just over 25% of national income.  How much of this could be explained by the neoclassical model depends on what the model says about the capital to output ratio and the return to capital.  If we assume that the capital to output ratio is around 3 and the return to capital is around 8%, then the neoclassical model would predict a capital share of 24%.  So maybe there is a little bit of an anomaly to explain, but let’s not get too carried away.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Certain Senate Republicans seem to be annoyed when Senate Democrats want to offer <a href="http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=116&#038;sid=1160423">amendments</a> to the immigration reform bill:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senators had been debating a contentious immigration overhaul for hours when Obama &#8211; the Illinois Democrat running for president &#8211; introduced an amendment that would end a key provision after five years rather than 14.  His target was a proposed point system that would make it easier for would-be immigrants to obtain visas based on their education levels or work skills rather than on having close relatives already living in the United States. &#8220;We can&#8217;t weaken the essence of what America is by turning our backs on immigrants who want to reunite with their family members,&#8221; Obama said in his speech. The amendment infuriated Graham, a South Carolina Republican with close ties to another presidential hopeful, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Pacing the Senate floor and waving Obama&#8217;s amendment, Graham loudly accused Obama of undermining a delicate agreement whose advocates have shown political courage.</p></blockquote>
<p>But when Harry Reid decided to move this bill towards a Senate vote, Mitch McConnell stuck a knife in the back of the majority leader as reported <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/06/07/congress.immigration.ap/index.html">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A broad immigration bill to legalize millions of people unlawfully in the United States failed a crucial test vote in the Senate Thursday, a stunning setback that could spell its defeat for the year.  The vote was 45-50 against limiting debate on the bill, 15 short of the 60 that the bill&#8217;s supporters needed to prevail. Most Republicans voted to block Democrats&#8217; efforts to bring the bill to a final vote … Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nevada, who had made no secret of his distaste for parts of the bill, said he would withdraw it but keep working toward eventual passage.  &#8220;I, even though disappointed, look forward to passing this bill,&#8221; Reid said. But he said he needs help from the White House. &#8220;This is the president&#8217;s bill,&#8221; Reid said. &#8220;&#8230; We can&#8217;t do it alone over here. We need some help.&#8221; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, urged Reid not to give up on the legislation, but allow debate on amendments to continue in order to resolve the objections of conservative senators. &#8220;This is a complicated bill, but the key to passage is not complicated,&#8221; McConnell said.  McConnell said all that&#8217;s needed is a &#8220;reasonable number of additional roll-call votes&#8221; on amendments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me get this straight.  When Senator Obama wants to offer an amendment to this bill – he gets attacked by Lindsey Graham.  But when Senator Reid wants to move this bill to a vote, the GOP leadership submarines the effort as they want more debate on new amendments.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_06/011461.php">Kevin Drum</a> provides a nice summary of the politics in the Senate:</p>
<blockquote><p>Look at the numbers. This was a bipartisan bill sponsored by Ted Kennedy and John McCain and supported by George Bush. Democrats voted 37-11 in favor of moving forward to a final vote. Republicans voted 38-7 against it. In the end, the Democratic leadership delivered nearly 80% of its votes. Bush couldn&#8217;t even get 20% of his party to go along. All I can say is: if it was extremists that killed this bill, then 80% of the Republican Party is made up of extremists.</p></blockquote>
<p>I truly abhor for Mitch McConnell to the degree that I would never turn my back on here knowing he just loves to stab Democrats in the back.  The minority leader is not to be trusted.  But Senator McConnell usually goes along with whatever President Bush wants.  In his Saturday morning radio address, the President pleaded that this bill should go forward.  If he was serious about this please, he would have Senator McConnell work in good faith with Senator Reid.</p>

                                <p>On one level, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTJmNWMxZGMyNDI1Y2YzODE2ZTRiMjhiZTk2N2E0OGQ=">William Buckley</a> admits to the obvious:</p>
<blockquote><p>The evidence appears to have been overwhelming that he lied to the FBI, and that in so doing he hindered the execution of justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before you begin to think that Mr. Buckley has decided to rise about the partisan liars known as the Corner Kids, read on:</p>
<blockquote><p>What he did was to involve himself in a security matter of no consequence. It was of no consequence at the time Libby figured in the proceedings because the nature of Joseph Wilson’s mission to Niger had already been revealed in the press, and his wife, Valerie Plame, was already moving out of the covert branch of the CIA &#8230; What he did was to involve himself in a security matter of no consequence. It was of no consequence at the time Libby figured in the proceedings because the nature of Joseph Wilson’s mission to Niger had already been revealed in the press, and his wife, Valerie Plame, was already moving out of the covert branch of the CIA &#8230; In the present case, Mrs. Wilson had already been assigned to non-covert work in the CIA &#8230; The reason to give thought to the triviality of Libby’s offense is precisely to unburden Bush of any sense of collaboration with true crime if he uses his pardoning power.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Buckley is not so stupid to think doing non-convert work during one month necessarily means one will not be doing covert work during the next.  Despite all the lies from his National Review colleagues purporting Ms. Plame was no longer a covert agent, the public record now clearly shows she was.  Mr. Buckley cannot stand behind a premise that is clearly false.  So why does he think the outing of a CIA agent to be a trivial matter?  Or for that matter – obstruction of justice seems to also be a trivial matter to Mr. Buckley as well.  How can he even begin to make such a statement?  Oh yea – he writes for the National Review.  Never mind.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post is going to look like a post on income inequality by presidential administration.  It even has a nice picture showing data going back to 1953.  I&#8217;ll start by describing what I did, and then explain why its not a post on income inequality.  </p>
<p>I was hoping data on the distribution of income per person.  The IRS has data on idnvidual income, but it has several problems, not the least of which it doesn&#8217;t go back before 1987.  (That&#8217;s OK, but not if other data is available.)  The Census unfortunately only computes median and mean income for individuals.  If you want to know how the income was distributed (e.g., bottom 20% get X, top 20% get Y, etc.) you have to make do with data on families or households.  </p>
<p>So I decided OK, let&#8217;s go with families.  See what it looks like.  Well&#8230; the Census also goes ahead and computes the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f04.html">Gini Ratio</a> for families in time series form.  Basically&#8230; the closer to 0, the more equality, the closer to 1, the more inequality.  (More information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">on Gini</a> here.)  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RmrEbJumj9I/AAAAAAAAAPI/WSKlqW3WtdU/s1600-h/gini,+families.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RmrEbJumj9I/AAAAAAAAAPI/WSKlqW3WtdU/s320/gini,+families.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>For the most part, the data fits with my intuition.  But there&#8217;s a problem&#8230; a huge jump between the last year of GHW&#8217;s term and the start of Clinton&#8217;s.  The same huge jump seems to exist with other series (e.g., percentage of income going to the top 5% jumps a lot, and we see the same thing with household data).  </p>
<p>To me, that speaks for a break&#8230; a change in how the series was computed.  Am I wrong about this?  Did income distribution jump that much between GHW&#8217;s term and Clinton&#8217;s, or is something wrong with the data?</p>

<blockquote><p>People often suppose or imply that free-market economists constitute a significant portion of all economists. We surveyed American Economic Association members and asked their views on 18 specific forms of government activism. We find that about 8 percent of AEA members can be considered supporters of free-market principles, and that less than 3 percent may be called strong upporters.</p></blockquote>
<p>They go on to suggest reasons why Economists tend to have the reputation for being free market types, one of the big ones being that they are&#8230; relative to other social science practitioners.</p>

                                <p>As I have said many times, when it comes to off-shoring, the domino effect prevails. Once a developing country&#8217;s manufacturing costs start to rise, global corporations look to the next country in the list. Most of us are aware that whole chains of production&#8211;including R&#038;D&#8211;have been moving to China. Well, one of the next stops is Vietnam. Here, according to <a href="http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=14302">Alex Bryant</a> in <i>Industry Week</i>, are the advantages of the new Asian newcomer:
<ul>
<li>In comparison to many of its Asian neighbors, Vietnam has a relatively inexpensive labor rate. For factory operators, the average salary is $200.00/month while key managers and senior engineers are paid $1,500.00/month. Vietnam has a 48 hour work week and the government-mandated social programs are approximately 25% of the salary costs. In comparison, China has a 40 hour work week and social costs are 50-60% of the operator&#8217;s salary.</p>
</li>
<li>The Vietnamese workforce is well-educated and hungry. The average age of an operator is 24 and a growing percentage of the workforce has a comfort zone with English as a second language due in large part to the availability of English language centers.
</li>
<li>The government has implemented an aggressive program of corporate income tax incentives. This program involves up to 4 years of tax holiday following (and including) the first year of &#8216;carried forward&#8217; profitability. Thereafter, the tax rate is 1/2 of the nominal tax rate for a period of up to 7 years, with a total application period of up to 15 years. The nominal tax rate can be 10%, 15%, or 20% &#8212; depending on the industry sector, investment classification and location. The standard tax rate is 28%.
</li>
<li>There are also duty free programs for the importation of capital goods (new and refurbished).
</li>
<li>While behind China, the Vietnamese government is committed to developing infrastructural balance, especially electricity and water supply, seaport services and telecom. Bilateral lenders and grants continue to be plentiful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Economists would do well to read industry magazines and those directly involved in globalization. They know how globalization works.</p>
<p>In conjunction with this piece of good news for the likes of Intel&#8211;which is investing one billion dollars in Ho Ching Ming City (an investment Intel&#8217;s suppliers will surely supplement as they move to Vietnam as well)&#8211;, economists are now finally arguing over the effect of all this offshoring on U.S. GDP. (Read <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_25/b4039001.htm">Business Week</a>.) Money is certainly pouring into the U.S. in the form of profits and upper management salaries. For the rest of us who have not been invited to the party, keep a tight grip on whatever benefits you presently have. We have a bifurcated economy.</p>
<p>Eventually, this game will end&#8230;and not happily. If we follow its logic, country after country will be squeezed. As soon as it the costs in one country start to rise, as soon as wages, for example go up, capital will move on to the next country. Following the logic further, each time a developing country tries to create a consuming, widespread, middle class, it and the U.S. will experience inflationary pressures as companies try to maintain profits or scramble to find more fertile cheap labor and other benefits.</p>
<p>Countries do not suddenly develop middle classes. Imagine that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007_05_01_angrybear_archive.html">poor Ipod</a> worker in China. Suppose his salary doubles from sixty cents an hour to $1.20/hour. That is inflationary. But is he now ready to step forward as a consumer? Not really. We have doubled the wage cost of the very goods we expect him to buy, but doubling his salary does not remotely begin to put him in middle class range. Globalization has been profoundly deflationary, both in services and goods, offsetting the rise in the price of energy. Many measure it as &#8220;efficiency.&#8221; This &#8220;efficiency&#8221; is an illusion and will come at a future cost. Cheap labor is efficient when it remains cheap&#8211;or gets cheaper.</p>
<p>And what will the Fed do as inflationary pressures rise, as the cost of goods rise, or as the dollar slumps against other countries, or as the price of energy increases? Raise rates?</p>
<p>The transition to a consuming society, assuming we get that far, will be very, very bumpy. The discrepancies between the West and developing countries are simply too vast. China&#8217;s real consumption so far has been in amazing infrastructure development, not in consumer goods. When the WTO ignored labor, it created a mechanism that cannot succeed. The models are too simplistic. Free trade between impoverished and wealthy nations cannot work as designed. We have created a complex mosaic of falling dominoes. Eventually, everyone will be flattened.</p>

                                <p>Governor Terminator of California wants to set his own auto emissions standards for his state. I assume he thinks this will drive the other states to follow (I believe 11 other states are now involved). Both the Big 3 and some of the foreign carmakers are less than thrilled with this concept.</p>
<p>Ignoring legal and regulatory problems for a moment, could this backfire on the Terminator?</p>
<p>The easiest way to meet this standard would be to limit the types of vehicles sold in California. Companies could limit sales to Corolla size and under, and refuse to sell pickup trucks, vans, or SUVs in the land of fruits and nuts. This would limit consumer choice and hurt auto industry profits (foreign and domestic).</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment operating a construction company with Chevy Aveos or<br />Toyota Matrixs.</p>
<p>The business response would have to be to upsize to commercial vehicles that are in different categories and probably pollute more. The obvious replacement for a construction company pickup would be a 1 ton flatbed, for example.</p>
<p>This would also be an incentive to keep older vehicles running past the normal service life.</p>
<p>Imagine the Oscar’s with celebrities arriving in Toyota Corollas. Imagine the screams of indignation from the celebrity crowd.</p>
<p>Imagine Paris Hilton in a Prius!</p>
<p>Rep. John Dingell (D., Michigan) is working to push through a compromise bill in Congress that would provide something for every interest group and shut down the Terminator.</p>
<p>Can this be a win-win? or are we headed for a lose-lose?</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write <a href="http://sideshow.me.uk/sjun07.htm#06080230">this post</a> for a while now.  But Avedon Carol actually did write it, and much better than I could have written it.  Its really very, very good:</p>
<blockquote><p>[S]ome conservatives have noticed that he [GW] hasn&#8217;t exactly upheld the alleged principles of conservatism.</p>
<p>The problem of course, is that Bush has upheld the principles of the conservative movement, and all of these so-called conservatives who are suddenly so disappointed in him had been cheering him on all along while he did all these things they supposedly didn&#8217;t like. And the thing is, they still haven&#8217;t repudiated the actual policies &#8211; just the outcome.</p>
<p>For example, none of these people are complaining about the fact that he lowered taxes in wartime, an unprecedented policy in all of history. They can complain all they like that he hasn&#8217;t been &#8220;fiscally conservative&#8221;, but they not only supported his war and his tax cuts, but they refused to so much as question the fact that he ran it in the most expensive way imaginable &#8211; not just pseudo-privatizing the functions of the armed services, but actually giving the private companies they outsourced to incentives to overspend and generally waste resources. (And they let him force them to pass the drug-benefit bill with a clause forbidding negotiations to keep prices down.)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>And then they did things like spend amazing amounts of money to have schools tell kids not to have sex. Now, you can cancel all sex education, or you can have real sex education, but why on earth would you need to pay strangers to tell kids not to have sex when they can hear it for free from their own parents, just as we always have? Can you say, &#8220;Waste of money&#8221;? I thought you could. Did you hear conservatives say it? Rarely, if it all.</p>
<p>Bush has not been spending all that money alone &#8211; he had the help of the entire Republican leadership and almost every Republican in Congress, as well as the rest of the conservative base, who never raised a whisper against this behavior.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more good stuff there.  Well worth a read.</p>

<p>Update&#8230;</p>
<p>It occurs to me that I did had a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/gws-accomplishments.html">post</a> a while back looking back noting that GW and the Republican Congress had their way with policies, but aren&#8217;t happy about the outcomes.  What they refuse to accept is that the policies, not just incompetence and random luck, have been largely to blame for these outcomes.</p>
