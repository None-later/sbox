<p>is commenting on a comment at Mark Thoma&#8217;s blog.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/06/links-for-2010-06-05.html#tpe-action-resize-400">The comment</a><br />  NotMarkT ha detto&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the difficulties with model selection for assessing tail probabilities is that the empirical data often can&#8217;t distinguish among light (e.g., normal) or heavy tailed (e.g., pareto) distributions. The model selection problem then becomes a question of optimism or pessimism in the face of uncertainty. By convention, optimism has won.</p></blockquote>
<p>(note that firefox speaks to me in Italian.) </p>
<p>My reply after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I think you are absolutely right.  However, the victory of optimism is odd, and, I think, impossible to reconcile with Bayesian rationality.  </p>
<p>First.  If we don&#8217;t know if distributions have thin or thick tails and the undeniably relevant data aren&#8217;t very informative (because we are talking about tails of distributions) then we should have a diffuse posterior.  Yet people repeatedly assume that they know for sure that a distribution is normal and the only uncertainty concerns means variances and covariances.  Acting as if you know something for sure, just because the data can&#8217;t prove you are wrong is not rational at all.</p>
<p>Note the key word &#8220;undeniably&#8221; in the paragraph above.  Since well before Gauss, firms and people have suffered because they assumed thin tails.  Financiers know this.  They all convince themselves that they stress test.  Then they all convince themselves that this time its different.  The lack of sufficient relevant data is based on the assumption that a whole lot of data is irrelevant.</p>
<p>I think that lack of sufficient undeniably relevant data is important, but it can&#8217;t be the whole explanation.  I think there are three other factors at work.  </p>
<p>First there are agency problems.  Traders who are allowed to cash out short horizon mark to market returns are rationally risk loving and can snow the top managers who are supposed to keep them from running too much risk.</p>
<p>Second there is self selection of the subjectively over confident.  If rational people know that they don&#8217;t know much of anything, then only irrational people will take massive positions and trade actively.  This means that the people who most affect asset prices underestimate variances of their forecast errors, but it also especially means that the people who matter over-estimate the probability that their preferred parametric specification is very close to reality.</p>
<p>Third there is selection of the people who take on lots of tail risk.  Some will get burned by tail risk and be fired.  The others will have high sample average returns with low sample variance and get promoted.  Promotion can mean a tenfold increase in their allowed gross long position.  This is irrational.  The top managers mistake luck for skill.  Obviously, their self esteem is based on assuming that what matters is skill not luck.</p>
<p>Finally, last but not least, as you note,  optimism is more fun and people don&#8217;t like to listen to Cassandras.</p>

<blockquote><p>Finance ministers from the world’s leading economies ripped up their support for fiscal stimulus on Saturday, recognising that financial market concerns over sovereign debt had forced a much greater focus on deficit reduction.</p>
<p>The meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Busan, South Korea, also dropped proposals for a global banking levy, instead giving countries leeway to do what they thought best for their domestic circumstances.</p>
<p>The communiqué of the meeting made it clear that the G20 no longer thought that expansionary fiscal policy was sustainable or effective in fostering an economic recovery because investors were no longer confident about some countries’ public finances. “The recent events highlight the importance of sustainable public finances and the need for our countries to put in place credible, growth-friendly measures, to deliver fiscal sustainability,” the communiqué stated&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Financial market concerns&#8221; are what?  The economy, which is ultimately Main Street?  Or profit for the industry?  And how do you help your Congressman and Senator see the differences enough to help your own situation with making enough to live somewhat comfortably?</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://politicalcorrection.org/blog/201006040005">John Boehner</a> uses Twitter to claim that economists think reductions in government spending will lead to an economic recovery. He has cited <a target="_blank" href="http://gopleader.gov/UploadedFiles/12-16-09_Economist_Policy_Statement.pdf">this letter</a> signed by 222 economists as the basis for his absurd claim. Let’s just say this is an opportunity for each of the 222 economists to either distance himself from Congressman Boehner’s absurd remark or to explain why they think the multiplier is negative.</p>

<blockquote><p> videos show more clearly than ever how BP, with little resistance from the Coast Guard or other federal agencies, kept the public in the dark about just how bad things were beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p>With an apparently complicit Coast Guard, BP held oil spill videos for weeks.</p>
<p>More PhotosOn May 1, 11 days after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, and nine days after oil began spilling into the Gulf, the Coast Guard had still only released a single image of oil leaking a mile beneath the surface &#8212; a fuzzy photograph of a broken pipe spewing oil. </p>
<p>But inside the unified command center, where BP and federal agencies were orchestrating the spill response, video monitors had already displayed hours of footage they did not make public. The images showed a far more dire situation unfolding underwater. The footage filmed by submarines showed three separate leaks, including one that was unleashing a torrent of oil into the Gulf. </p>
<p>BP officials said they made all the video available to federal officials. </p>
<p>&#8220;The video has been available to the unified command from the very beginning,&#8221; said Mark Proegler, a BP spokesman. &#8220;It&#8217;s always been here from the beginning. They had it.&#8221; </p>
<p>Coast Guard officials told ABC News that BP refused to allow them to release the more startling images, arguing they were proprietary. But at the time, the agency was doing little to convey to the world what the images were showing. Coast Guard Admiral Mary Landry was sticking with estimates, calculated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which put the spill&#8217;s size at about 5,000 barrels a day for several weeks. Coast Guard officials said they were focused on the response, and advised the public not to worry about just how much oil was pouring into the water.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure&#8230;the less we know and verify the better off we are.</p>

<p>High on the list of tasks mandated of the Obama Deficit Commission is to get the deficit down to 3% of GDP by 2015. Unfortunately for them they have set up a situation where they can&#8217;t move that number via cuts to Social Security, if anything such cuts more one of their metrics the wrong way. To understand why we need to revisit old friends including &#8216;Leninist Strategy&#8217;, &#8216;CSSS&#8217;, &#8216;deficit&#8217;, &#8216;debt&#8217; and &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217;.</p>
<p>It was well understood as far back as the publication of Butler and Germanis&#8217; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2.html">Leninist Strategy (11th article here)</a> in 1983 that cutting benefits in the near term for existing retirees and even for newly approaching retirees was both politically deadly and deeply inequitable, these people simply didn&#8217;t have time to do alternative planning through Personal Retirement Accounts or anything else. This reality was explicitly recognized by Bush&#8217;s 2001 Commission to Strengthen Social Security where it was established as Guiding Principle no 1 of 6 <a target="_blank" href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/csss/index.htm">CSSS</a>. Now how long this grace period should be and whether it would be permanent for that class of retirees, or whether they would ultimately share in whatever index changes were adopted vary across plans. What doesn&#8217;t vary is the fact that no plan entirely based  on benefit cuts can move that 2015 target number.</p>
<p>The why and how of this below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The first problem is that Social Security &#8216;reformers&#8217; continually confuse &#8216;deficit&#8217;, &#8216;debt&#8217; and &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217;. They implicitly assume that current year deficits sum into ten year debt increases which in turn equate to long-term unfunded liabilities. And if we were just talking about General Fund spending this would largely be so. But Social Security throws some wrinkles in.</p>
<p>Lets take the extreme case, one where benefit cuts happen right away from Day One. Well if big enough they would put Social Security back in cash-flow positive  territory (CBO&#8217;s &#8216;Primary Surplus&#8217;) and so score as a reduction in deficits compared to the baseline, so far so good. But by forestalling the need to pay a portion of the interest accruing on the Trust Fund in cash those cuts equally serve to pad the bottom line of Trust Fund balances, which for this purpose score as a part of total Public Debt. To make it worse interest not paid out in cash gets transformed into new principal which itself starts drawing interest and so boosting Trust Fund Balances compared to the baseline. Exactly how are you creating &#8216;intergenerational equity&#8217; and relieving your children and grand-children when the net effect of short term cuts is a boost in long-term debt. (I know this sounds goofy, but that  is the way the numbers run).</p>
<p>So the Commission is already in a trap, they can improve the short term deficit position by cutting benefits and in so doing also have positive effects on 75 year and Infinite Future actuarial gaps but only at the cost of actually increasing Public Debt over the medium term. But it gets worse, because they have already ruled out short term benefit cuts.</p>
<p>The strictest plan being floated right now is that of co-Chairman Alan Simpson. He would reduce the grace period so that it only cover people 60 and older. But this means that you simply don&#8217;t see any savings at all until people now aged 59 reach Full Retirement Age which in practice means 2017. Meaning you don&#8217;t move the number in the target year of 2015 AT ALL. And unless you quickly phase in those benefit cuts in a big way in 2017 you end up with no real impact on your standard CBO Ten Year score.</p>
<p>And the Ryan Roadmap makes this worse, he would exempt people 55 and older which means your very first savings come in 2022 and so outside the 10 Year scoring window altogether. And  then you have people like Bachmann vaguely  proposing to &#8216;wean&#8217; people under 50 off Social Security, which puts any savings off until 2027. Which is fine if your real goal is to eliminate Social Security over the long run, but not particularly compelling when you are trying to sell this as a deficit and debt reduction measure sparked by short term Obama spending. It literally does not compute.</p>
<p>The current public line being taken by most of the Commissioners is that they have to tackle Social Security to show the bond market that they are serious. But since it is doubtful they have the cojones to cut  benefits in the short term and even if they do won&#8217;t have the effect they need on either their Public Debt or Debt Held by the Public metrics, how is that supposed to reassure the bond markets of anything?</p>
<p>Now the Commission has a tiny exit hole. If they can keep the focus entirely on reducing the 75 year and Infinite Future actuarial gap and keep the public in the dark about the actual effect of their proposals on ten year deficits and twenty year debt levels they might escape the trap. But their political need in the here and now to make unpopular future cuts to Social Security somehow forced on them by current deficits makes it difficult for them to pull the bait and switch, over the last year the  informed public has been trained to look at the CBO score and in that regard the Commission has nothing.</p>

Private employment only increased 41,000, significantly less than in the previous few months.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAkCUsIRXTI/AAAAAAAABKY/ht4vRFl4IAc/s1600/Clipboard04-PAYROLL.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAkCUsIRXTI/AAAAAAAABKY/ht4vRFl4IAc/s320/Clipboard04-PAYROLL.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The unemployment rate fell, but  that was just as much a result of a rise in discouraged workers as a rise in employment as measured by the household survey.</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAkCv-Iy4hI/AAAAAAAABKo/d2jZS6IDdxo/s1600/Clipboard02-emp+diff.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAkCv-Iy4hI/AAAAAAAABKo/d2jZS6IDdxo/s320/Clipboard02-emp+diff.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>As in previous months the rise in aggregate hours worked rose nicely even though it was only up 0.3% as compared to 0.4% in the last few months.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAkERK8vTHI/AAAAAAAABK4/tT8irBmVXVs/s1600/Clipboard07-HOURS.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAkERK8vTHI/AAAAAAAABK4/tT8irBmVXVs/s320/Clipboard07-HOURS.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Wage gains were also moderate as average hourly earnings rose 0.3% and were up only 1.9% over the last 12 months.  But because of the gains in hours worked average weekly earnings continued to improve.</p>

<p>Help!!!!</p>
<p>The publisher has put together some <ital>Advance Reading Copies</ital> of <ital>Presimetrics</ital>.  They&#8217;re bound-up versions of the book usually sent out to media for an advance read on the book.</p>
<p>Obviously, they&#8217;d like my co-author and I to get them into the hands of the most influential people possible for them to review &#8217;em.  Anyone have any contacts?  I&#8217;d be very grateful for any assistance.</p>
<p>If so, please e-mail me at &#8220;mikekimel&#8221; with a period between the mike and the kimel &#8220;@&#8221; gmail. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p><strong>Federal Government Stupidity &#8211; Part 2</strong><br />Part 2 of an occasional series</p>
<p>When Verizon wanted to merge with Alltel the feds allowed the merger but created a bizarre and weird system that disallowed most Verizon stores from servicing Verizon customers. How this increases competition eludes me.</p>
<p>So my son is traveling and goes to a Verizon store for service on his Verizon cell phone, and is told he cannot get Verizon service at a Verizon store because the feds will not allow it.</p>
<p>Huh? Excerpts from a Verizon email.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. xxxxx, when Verizon Wireless acquired Alltel and its markets, one of the stipulations from the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Comission, was that where overlap in markets existed between the two providers, Verizon Wireless would have to divest itself from these markets and sell operations to another wireless provider.  You should have received a letter to this effect.  You are in one of those markets.   </p>
<p>Much as we would like to keep long-time customers such as yourself, it is not an option.  This is why the store personnel no longer have access to your account information.  Certainly, if you need support we will be glad to provide it.  Simply send us an e-mail, or you may contact Customer Service at 800-922-0204.  The store will not have your records.  I do apologize for any further inconvenience this may cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duh. We still have a Verizon account, we just cannot get service at a Verizon store.</p>

<p>“The only good news from the oil spill is that when catastrophe strikes, even some hard-line conservatives, like Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, start begging for the federal government to act, and act big. It’s the crunch moment for government to make its case — as Obama belatedly started to do on Thursday. But words are no match for results. As long as the stain washes up on shore, the hole in BP’s pipe will serve the right as a gaping hole in the president’s argument for expanded government supervision of, for starters, Big Oil and big banks. It’s not just the gulf that could suffer for decades to come.”<br />—Frank Rich, New York Times, Sunday </p>
<p>I love Frank Rich.  I agree with him almost always, and am thrilled that someone whose commentary will be read by millions, among them people who, well, matter, actually says what I would say if I wrote a column that is read by millions—among them people who matter.  </p>
<p>And Sunday’s column was no exception.  Well, except for that second-last sentence in what is the final paragraph of the column.  </p>
<p>Rich is one of the few political commentators who recognize rote conventional wisdom for what it is: mechanical, formulaic, and often out-of-date pronouncements that echo from one to another to another pundit, without questioning, without independent analysis.  So I was surprised that he accepts unquestioningly the presumption that the federal government’s failure to stem the tide of oil pouring into the Gulf is good news for the Tea Partiers and the more traditional “pro small-government/pro large-corporation” Republicans.  There is, after all, a difference between a government’s inability to pull off an engineering feat of a perhaps-impossible nature after a crisis has arisen and the government’s ability to force the prevention of such crises in the first place.  And that difference is what this oil-spill tragedy demonstrates, in high relief.  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />The art term, not the term of art.</p>
<p>The larger tenet of Reich’s column is an accurate one: “Obama,” he says, “was elected as a progressive antidote to [Bush’s] discredited brand of governance. Of all the president’s stated goals, none may be more sweeping than his desire to prove that government is not always a hapless and intrusive bureaucratic assault on taxpayers’ patience and pocketbooks, but a potential force for good.”  But a prerequisite to government’s ability to competently act as a force for good—in this instance, a force for the prevention of immense harm to millions of people, many of them undoubtedly Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin aficionados, is that the government first be given the legal authority, the legal responsibility, and the actual means with which to do this.  <br />Yes, most big-government-versus-small-government issues lend themselves to the irrational we-want-it-both-ways (“Keep your government hands off my Medicare!”) demagoguery.  But not this one.  Which is why this one is far more likely to kill the Tea Party movement than help it.  As Rich notes, Rand Paul claimed in his victory speech after winning the Republican primary in a race for an open Senate seat in Tennessee earlier this month, his victory was a victory for the Tea Party.  </p>
<p>But because, also as Rich mentions, Paul soon attributed the BP spill to mere accident—“Accidents happen”—rather than to premeditated negligence, and because a cascade of internal BP memos leaked to the New York Times, which reported on them on Saturday, detail in jaw-dropping fashion exactly how this particular accident happened, the Tea Party movement is likely to be, rather than enhanced by this situation, fatally wounded by it. </p>
<p>The stains that wash up on shore, the destruction of the fishing industry in the Gulf and the perhaps nearly as devastating impact on tourism, even on some of Florida’s gulf coast, the death of thousands of birds, and who knows what else, cannot logically be seen as an argument for failing to dramatically strengthen government oversight over mega-corporations and mega-industries that can cause such profound, extensive, undeniable, harm—immediate and long-term—to such a huge swath of the public and to the fundamental ecosystem.  </p>
<p>The federal government is impotent to mitigate this disaster because it has not had what is should have had and what, hopefully it now will be given: a small separate agency staffed entirely with top-flight, well-paid engineers who can develop strategies that geared toward preventing such catastrophes and dealing expeditiously and proficiently with crises when they do occur.  But the federal government was powerless to prevent this crisis not because of an inherent failure of government, by its very nature, to do so but instead because of the triumph of an ideology whose very goal was to render the government powerless and the oil companies and other huge industries all-powerful to determine so much for all of us.  </p>
<p>If this calamity in the Gulf illustrates anything—and it does—it’s that libertarian ideology should not be limited to government imposition upon individual rights.  BP, which will affect the quality of life for so many individuals for a long time to come, is not a government subsidiary.  Not technically, anyway.</p>
