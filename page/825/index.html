                                <p>This post looks at the prime earning demographic and whether that can explain some of the patterns in real median income we observe in Presidential administrations since Ike. What’s the prime earning demographic? According to the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p08ar.html">Census</a>, since 1983 it has been the 45 – 54 year old cohort. Before 1982, it was the 35 – 44 year old group (with one exception, 1978, which we will disregard). </p>
<p>This is a follow-up to yesterday’s post where I looked at real median income and 45 – 54 year olds… I wrongly assumed that 45 – 54 year olds were the prime demographic through the entire post WW2 era. Apologies. </p>
<p>The point of the post is simple…if demographics are the explanation for the extremely fast increase in real median income during the JFK/LBJ and Clinton administrations noted in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/real-median-income-by-presidential.html">my post on real median income</a>, presumably we’d expect to see much more of these prime-earning folks wandering around during those administrations than at other points. Similarly, given the drops in real median observed during the Carter, GHW, Nixon/Ford, and GW administrations, we’d expect to see a lower percentage of these high earning folks during those administrations. So let’s see.</p>
<p>Demographic data from 1980 to 2005 comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0011.xls">here</a>, and demographic data going back to 1952 was obtained from <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/pre-1980/PE-11.html">here</a>. Real median income also comes from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p07ar.html">Census </a>.</p>
<p>So here’s what the prime earning population as a percentage of the total population looks like over time.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yWzb6OFI/AAAAAAAAAYo/9MKxO38eOoI/s1600-h/Prime+Demographic,+Graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yWzb6OFI/AAAAAAAAAYo/9MKxO38eOoI/s320/Prime+Demographic,+Graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Note… the big drop is the year the prime earning group changed from one cohort to another. </p>
<p>Here’s a summary…</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yRzb6OEI/AAAAAAAAAYg/I6GMWZuuZL8/s1600-h/Prime+Demographic,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yRzb6OEI/AAAAAAAAAYg/I6GMWZuuZL8/s320/Prime+Demographic,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Only 6 years of the Reagan admin was used because of the change in cohorts.) </p>
<p>Well… Clinton did have the fastest growth rate in the high earning folks… so maybe some of his real median income performance is due to that. But he was followed by GHW, Carter, and GW… under whom real median income growth was, well, not exactly growth for those of us who consider growth to be movement in a positive direction. JFK/LBJ, under whom real median income grew faster than under any other administration, actually had the biggest decrease in the prime earning demographic. So for whatever reason, it doesn’t seem like the percentage of the population in the prime earning demographic doesn’t seem like the driver of earnings in any given administration. Some figures…</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yDTb6OCI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/ZfM9QCHerFo/s1600-h/Prime+Demographic,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yDTb6OCI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/ZfM9QCHerFo/s320/Prime+Demographic,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Yes, there is a positive correlation between the change in the percentage of the population that is made up of this prime demographic and the percentage change in the real median income, but its not particularly high. Interestingly enough… the correlation hits its peak some six years out… the change in the percentage of people in the prime earning demographic in any given year is correlated with percentage changes in real median income six years later.</p>
<p>And now a graph.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yKDb6ODI/AAAAAAAAAYY/B9fc5_k74JQ/s1600-h/Prime+Demographic,+Graph+2.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yKDb6ODI/AAAAAAAAAYY/B9fc5_k74JQ/s320/Prime+Demographic,+Graph+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So… the excellent performance of the real median income during the JFK/LBJ, Clinton, and to a lesser extent Reagan years doesn’t seem to be explained the prime demographic? And as we’ve noted in earlier posts, economic performance is also not explained by the Congress, the recessions, lags, etc. Which brings us back, as always to… either its policy or its quite a coincidence, but almost all of the series we’ve looked at so far (economic or social) have JFK/LBJ and/or Clinton at the top of the heap.</p>

<p>The London Doctors and the Myth of the Suicide Bomber (Part II)</p>
<p>Michael Ledeen in National Review (please don&#8217;t stop reading) discusses terrorism as  a manifestation of man&#8217;s evil nature <br /><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/ledeen/ledeen200507190807.asp">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The evil can&#8217;t be explained by economic misery, or social alienation, or even by the doctrines adopted by the terrorists. The problem lies within us. â€œ</p>
<p>They are not misfits or sociopaths. They are people who find it fulfilling to kill us and destroy our society. As time passes, we will meet more and more of them. And, in the fullness of time, we will remember that Machiavelli warned us half a millennium ago that &#8220;man is more inclined to do evil than to do good,&#8221; and that the primary role of statesmen and other leaders is to contain the dark forces of human nature. Evil cannot be &#8220;fixed&#8221; by some social program or suitably energetic public-affairs strategy, or by &#8220;reaching out&#8221; to our misguided comrades. It must be dominated.</p>
<p>How do we contain the dark forces of  human nature?</p></blockquote>
<p>James Q Wilson in <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/html/14_1_what_makes_a_terrorist.html">What Makes a Terrorist</a> goes through the many recent terror-type movements from World War II Nazism to Communism, to abortion clinic bombings in an effort to understand and find an effective response to Islamic terror threat today.  Given that the al-Queda threat is comprised of many small groups that cross state boundaries, but united in their desire to bring Islamic rule to the West, supported by a milieu of supportive Islam society and resources.  Does it make sense to look at this as a small group problem?:</p>
<blockquote><p>While some suicide bombers have been the victims of blackmail, and some have been led to believe, wrongly, that the bombs in their trucks would go off after they had left them, my sense is that most recruitment today relies on small-group pressure and authoritative leaders. Anyone who took social-science courses in college will surely remember the famous experiments by Stanley Milgram. In the 1960s, Milgram, then a professor at Yale, recruited ordinary people through a newspaper ad offering them money to help in a project purporting to improve human memory. The improvement was to come from punishing a man who seemed unable to remember words read aloud to him. The man, a confederate of Milgram’s, was strapped in a chair with an electrode attached to his wrist. The punishment took the form of electric shocks administered by the experimental subjects from a control panel, showing a scale of shocks, from 15 to 450 volts. At the high end of the scale, clearly marked labels warned: “Danger—Severe Shock.” As the subject increased the imaginary voltage, the man who was supposed to have his memory improved screamed in pretended pain.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of the subjects Milgram had recruited went all the way to 450 volts. Only two things made a difference: the absence of a clear authority figure and the presence of rebellious peers. Without these modifications, almost everybody decided to “follow orders.” This study suggests to me that, rightly managed, a cohesive group with an authoritative leader can find people who will do almost anything.</p>
<p>Terrorist cells, whether they have heard of Stanley Milgram’s Obedience to Authority or not, understand these rules. They expose members to unchallenged authority figures and quickly weed out anyone who might be rebellious. They get rid of doubts by getting rid of the doubters.</p>
<p>This is not very different from how the military maintains morale under desperate conditions. Soldiers fight because their buddies fight. Heroism usually derives not from some deep heroic “urge” or from thoughts of Mom, apple pie, and national ideology, but from the example of others who are fighting.</p>
<p>Milgram did not train terrorists; he showed that one instinct Cynthia Ozick neglected—the instinct to be part of a team—can be as powerful as the one that tells us to be decent to other people. But suppose Milgram had been the leader of a terrorist sect and had recruited his obedient followers into his group; suppose teachings in the schools and mass propaganda supported his group. There is almost no limit to what he could have accomplished using such people. They might not have been clinically ill, but they would have been incorporated into a psychopathological movement.</p>
<p>The central fact about terrorists is not that they are deranged, but that they are not alone. Among Palestinians, they are recruited by Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, among others. In Singapore, their recruitment begins with attendance at religious schools. If ardent and compliant, they are drawn into Jemaah Islamiyah, where they associate with others like themselves. Being in the group gives each member a sense of special esteem and exclusivity, reinforced by the use of secrecy, code names, and specialized training. Then they are offered the chance to be martyrs if they die in a jihad. Everywhere, leaders strengthen the bombers’ commitment by isolating them in safe houses and by asking them to draft last testaments and make videotapes for their families, in which they say farewell.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is there a micro solution, rather than George Bush&#8217;s macro solution?</p>

<blockquote>Statistics are one way to tell the story of the approximately 1.4 million servicemen and women who’ve been to Iraq and Afghanistan. According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2004, 86 percent of soldiers in Iraq reported knowing someone who was seriously injured or killed there. Some 77 percent reported shooting at the enemy; 75 percent reported seeing women or children in imminent peril and being unable to help. Fifty-one percent reported handling or uncovering human remains; 28 percent were responsible for the death of a noncombatant. One in five Iraq veterans returns home seriously impaired by post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>Words are another way. Below are the stories of three veterans of this war, told in their voices, edited for flow and efficiency but otherwise unchanged. They bear out the statistics and suggest that even those who are not diagnosably impaired return burdened by experiences they can neither forget nor integrate into their postwar lives. They speak of the inadequacy of what the military calls reintegration counseling, of the immediacy of their worst memories, of their helplessness in battle, of the struggle to rejoin a society that seems unwilling or unable to comprehend the price of their service. Strangers to one another and to me, they nevertheless tried, sometimes through tears, to communicate what the intensity of an ambiguous war has done to them. One veteran, Sue Randolph, put it this way: “People walk up to me and say, ‘Thank you for your service.’ And I know they mean well, but I want to ask, ‘Do you know what you’re thanking me for?’” She, Rocky, and Michael Goss offer their stories here in the hope that citizens will begin to know.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their stories are in <a href="http://www.texasobserver.org/article.php?aid=2537">the article</a>.</p>

                                <p>I have to confess – I love the <em>Men in Black</em> movies.  So many really silly lines, so little time.  <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/meninblackii">Men in Black II</a> had agent K working at a post office where many of the employees just happened to be aliens.  Well, in Men Black III, we might see J &#038; K replaced with Jerry Bowyer and Neil Cavuto with one of the premises that the US health care system has been nationalized and is being run by aliens.  Or was that terrorists?  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/07/05/fox-news-universal-health-care-breeds-terrorists">Amanda</a> previews the script:</p>
<blockquote><p>A state run health care enterprise is bureaucratic, and I think the terrorists have shown over and over again, whether it’s dealing with INS or whether it’s dealing with airport security, they’re very good at gaming the system with bureaucracies. They’re very good at getting around bureaucracies.…And if one of your guys is a jihadist, if one of your doctors is spending all the time online reading Osama bin Laden fatwas, someone’s going to notice that. But the National Health Service is more like the post office, you know there’s a lot of anonymity, it’s easy to hide in the bureaucracy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Come to think of it – the producers of Men in Black are not this stupid.</p>

<blockquote><p>The day before Senate Watergate Committee minority counsel Fred Thompson made the inquiry that launched him into the national spotlight &#8211; asking an aide to President Nixon whether there was a White House taping system &#8211; he telephoned Nixon&#8217;s lawyer. Thompson tipped off the White House that the committee knew about the taping system and would be making the information public. In his all-but-forgotten Watergate memoir, &#8220;At That Point in Time,&#8221; Thompson said he acted with &#8220;no authority&#8221; in divulging the committee&#8217;s knowledge of the tapes, which provided the evidence that led to Nixon&#8217;s resignation. It was one of many Thompson leaks to the Nixon team, according to a former investigator for Democrats on the committee, Scott Armstrong , who remains upset at Thompson&#8217;s actions.  &#8220;Thompson was a mole for the White House,&#8221; Armstrong said in an interview. &#8220;Fred was working hammer and tong to defeat the investigation of finding out what happened to authorize Watergate and find out what the role of the president was.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the same fellow who thought Scooter Libby should not go to jail.  Go figure.</p>

                                <p>When I read <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/04/clinton.libby/index.html">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Former President Bill Clinton blasted his successor&#8217;s decision to spare former White House aide I. Lewis &#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby from prison, telling Iowa radio listeners that Libby&#8217;s case differed from his own administration&#8217;s pardon controversy. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to understand, this is consistent with their philosophy,&#8221; Clinton said during an interview on Des Moines news-talk station WHO.  Bush administration officials, he said, &#8220;believe that they should be able to do what they want to do, and that the law is a minor obstacle.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I figured <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/05/clinton.libby/index.html">this</a> was coming:</p>
<blockquote><p>White House spokesman Tony Snow fired back at former President Bill Clinton after Clinton charged that the Bush administration believes the law is a &#8220;minor obstacle&#8221; in the &#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby case … In an op-ed piece in USA Today on Wednesday, Snow defended Bush&#8217;s action, charging that Clinton was &#8220;in a mad rush to push through pardons with dizzying haste &#8211; 141 grants on Clinton&#8217;s final day in office, part of 211 in the final nine weeks.&#8221; &#8230; Clinton&#8217;s flurry of last-minute pardons issued as he left office in 2001 &#8211; particularly his absolution of fugitive financier Marc Rich &#8211; sparked largely partisan outrage. Critics alleged that the pardon of Rich was linked to contributions raised for Clinton&#8217;s presidential library by Rich&#8217;s ex-wife.  Libby&#8217;s defenders have pointed to Democratic support for Clinton during that period to accuse critics of Bush&#8217;s commutation order of hypocrisy. Asked by a reporter if he was asserting that &#8220;two wrongs make a right,&#8221; Snow said: &#8220;Do we feel we&#8217;ve done wrong? Do we feel we cut corners? The answer is no.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The answer to the report’s <em><strong>actual</strong></em> question was yes &#8211; that precisely was Snow&#8217;s game here.  But two wrongs do not make a right.  Tony Snow, however, made up his own questions &#8211; and then lied.  The commutation of Libby’s jail time was a continuation of the cover-up of a very serious matter.  This Administration outed a CIA agent for purely partisan purposes.  That is clearly wrong.  And the cover-up is wrong.</p>
<p>I have never excused the pardon of Marc Rich.  In my opinion, that was wrong.  But that pardon is indeed different than the outing of a CIA agent &#8211; unless Marc Rich did out a CIA agent.  Did he?  If not, Tony Snow was being his usual horse’s a$$.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Since we will have to endure the stupid comments from the water carriers of this corrupt White House as to whether there was a crime or not, let me highlight what <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/07/were_crimes_committed.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> and <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/07/distinguished.php#comment-292352">Steve </a> said.  First – the key portion from Steve’s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The real issue is what Cheney knew and when he knew it. Libby&#8217;s lies were intentionally designed to keep Fitzgerald from getting a closer look at Cheney and determining what role Cheney had in the leak campaign and whether he knew Plame was covert. That&#8217;s why the obstruction was a big deal. That&#8217;s why no one was charged; the IIPA requires that you prove knowledge and Fitzgerald couldn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now Matt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of Libby&#8217;s defenders &#8211; George W. Bush, David Brooks, etc. &#8211; don&#8217;t seem to be denying that Libby committed a crime by lying under oath to investigators. They want us to say that, rather, he deserves to be treated very leniently because there was no big deal here. The alleged absence of an underlying crime is key to that theory. The converse theory is that there was an underlying crime and the crime can&#8217;t be proven because Libby lied to investigators. If that theory is wrong &#8211; if there really was no crime &#8211; then it seems we ought to get some kind of explanation from Libby as to why he lied &#8230; He&#8217;s not even trying to convince us that he had some other reason to lie.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course he isn’t.  This is incredibly simple.  Libby knows his boss set this whole thing in motion.  In other words, he knows Cheney is guilty as charged.  But he knows as does the White House that the only path to proving this in Court is through Libby.  So we have the deal.  Libby falls on the sword and Bush promises that Libby will not spend one day in jail.  Neat trick – eh?</p>

                                <p>A while back – Bruce Bartlett was so kind to email a link to his <a href="http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_12_01_01_bartlett.pdf">“Starve the Beast” Origins and Development of a Budgetary Metaphor</a>.  Within this history behind this phrase and how it has been (ab)used by certain politicians, I’ve been meaning to argue that Starve the Beast is not he correct metaphor for the modern Republican Party.  As <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/delong_economics_only/2007/07/jared-bernstein.html">Brad DeLong</a> objected to the latest from <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/07/on-charlatons-and-cranks.html">Greg Mankiw</a> (for somewhat different reasons than <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/cea-before-1966-credit-crunch-v-cea-in.html">my objection</a>, he points to a wonderful piece from a true small government conservative &#8211; <a href="http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1143">Alex Tabarrok</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I favor a much smaller government but I do not favor the Bush tax cut. Or, to be more precise, I would support a tax cut if one had been proposed. But so far President Bush has neither proposed nor implemented a tax cut &#8211; only a tax shift. To grasp the difference between a tax cut and a tax shift, we must first understand that what ultimately drives taxes is spending. If spending increases, as it has under the current administration, then sooner or later taxes must increase (or inflation, a type of tax, will go up). Milton Friedman, the libertarian-leaning Nobel prize-winning economist, has long reminded us to be suspicious of any tax cut not matched by a spending cut. If spending isn’t cut, then less taxes today means more taxes tomorrow. Thus, the Bush tax cut plan is really a plan for future tax increases … although Bush’s tax proposal does shift taxes away from capital (which, other things equal, would promote long-run economic growth), the mismatch between the tax cuts and spending increases means a rise in government borrowing to make up the difference. Some of this borrowing will come out of capital markets, thereby draining the source of private investment. Thus, on net, I don’t expect significant gains in long-run economic growth from these tax cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Bush Administration not only gave us a bloated prescription drug benefit program but has also increased defense spending.  Outside of Ron Paul (who will not get the GOP nomination for 2008) those GOP hopefuls to replace George W. Bush all seem to be calling for even more defense spending.  This includes especially Mitt Romney who has Greg Mankiw as one of his economic advisors.  While Bruce Bartlett and Alex Tabarrok may be advocating less government spending, the political leaders of the GOP are not really listening.  Credit goes to both Bruce Bartlett and Alex Tabarrok for understanding the implication of “big government conservatism” &#8211; to use the oxymoron once used by Fred Barnes – that this means taxes must go up for someone at sometime.  OK, Fred Barnes isn’t smart enough to get this but I would trust Greg Mankiw is.  </p>
<p>But let’s go back to what Bruce wrote to suggest the size of the government really is not what is at issue here.  Rather, it’s who should pay for this government.  Some key excerpts follow:</p>
<blockquote><p>The budgetary experience of recent years, in which Congress has enacted large tax cuts and large spending increases at the same time, has caused some former supporters of the starve-the-beast idea to reconsider their view. However, the metaphor remains a powerful one. In this article, I trace the origins and development of the idea and the reasons why it rose to prominence not just among policymakers, but among professional economists as well &#8230; The earliest recent use I have seen of the precise term starve the beast as it relates to the budget appeared in a Wall Street Journal news story in 1985. Reporter Paul Blustein quoted an unnamed White House official as lamenting that not enough had been done to cut spending during the Reagan administration. “We didn’t starve the beast,” the official said. “It’s still eating quite well &#8211; by feeding off future generations” &#8230; when the next Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, took office in 1953, he strenuously resisted efforts by Republicans in Congress to cut taxes. He insisted that balancing the budget had to take precedence, even though tax rates were extraordinarily high owing to the Korean War. As Eisenhower explained at a press conference on February 17, 1953, “Whether we are ready to face the job this minute or any other time, the fact is there must be balanced budgets before we are again on a safe and sound system in our economy. That means, to my mind, that we cannot afford to reduce taxes, reduce income, until we have in sight a program of expenditures that shows that the factors of income and of outgo will be balanced.  Now that is just to my mind sheer necessity” &#8230; Richard Nixon, Eisenhower’s vice president, continued this policy of resisting tax cuts and supporting tax increases after his election as president in 1968. One of his earliest actions in 1969 was to ask Congress for extension of the 1968 surtax, despite having promised during the campaign to allow it to expire on schedule … Gerald Ford, after succeeding Nixon in 1974, similarly resisted political pressure to cut taxes permanently, supporting only a temporary tax rebate in 1975, while asking for higher taxes on individuals and corporations and allowing inflation to raise taxes automatically as taxpayers were pushed into higher tax brackets and business depreciation allowances were eroded</p></blockquote>
<p>It is true that the Republican Party from the Eisenhower Administration to the Ford Administration did adhere to long-run fiscal restraint but something changed when Ronald Reagan began campaigning for the White House:</p>
<blockquote><p>In an influential article in early 1976, Wall Street Journal editorial writer Jude Wanniski blasted Ford for timidity in cutting taxes. He argued that the nation needed each political party to be a different type of Santa Claus &#8211; the Democrats being the spending Santa Claus and the Republicans being the tax-cutting Santa Claus. By refusing to play its proper role and instead being the party of the balanced budget, Republicans had hurt not only themselves, but the nation as a whole. Declared Wanniski: “The political tension in the marketplace of ideas must be between tax reduction and spending increases, and as long as Republicans have insisted upon balanced budgets, their influence as a party has shriveled, and budgets have been unbalanced.” &#8230; Writing on the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, which often sets the Republican agenda on economic policy, columnist Irving Kristol made clear the political connection between tax cuts and government spending. Tax cuts, he explained, are essential to shrinking the size of government. Republicans and conservatives, he said, “have learned the lesson of Proposition 13, which is that tax cuts are a prerequisite for cuts in government spending. The politics of the budgetary process is such that a cut in any particular program will provoke intense opposition from a minority, and only indifference from the majority. In such a case, it is unreasonable to expect politicians to pay the high political costs involved. They can only cut when they are seen to have no alternative”.  At this point, the circle had been largely squared. Instead of being viewed as the height of fiscal irresponsibility, cutting taxes without any corresponding effort to cut spending was now seen as the epitome of conservative fiscal policy. Trying to cut spending in isolation was both doomed to failure and counterproductive because<br />focusing attention on the deficit was more likely to lead to increasing taxes and thus expanding the size of government. The only way off the treadmill of higher spending leading to higher taxes leading to still more spending was to refuse to play the game.  Just cut taxes, the conservative intelligentsia now argued, and concern about deficits will be channeled into lower spending &#8230; During the 1980 campaign, Ronald Reagan endorsed the Kemp-Roth tax cut, but he also insisted that he would sharply cut government spending. Upon taking office in 1981, he followed through on this promise and asked Congress for spending cuts as  well as tax cuts &#8230; However, Reagan was unwilling to hold his tax cuts hostage to congressional inaction on spending. In explaining why tax cuts should precede spending cuts, he said that the former would pave the way for the latter, as the starve-the-beast theory posited.</p></blockquote>
<p>We should stop right here and simply note that Federal spending did not decline during the Reagan Administration.  But let’s return to what Bruce has to say about that 1993 debate over whether to raise taxes:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Capitol Hill as well, the modified starve-the-beast theory made inroads even among moderates who had previously supported tax increases to reduce budget deficits. After taking so much political heat, many members of Congress were apparently dismayed to see that so little progress was accomplished toward permanent resolution of the deficit problem. One of these legislators was Senator Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), who during floor debate on Bill Clinton’s proposed tax increase in 1993 said: “The history of the U.S. Government is that when we increased taxes, we spent them; we did not apply it to the deficit. It does not matter that the President has stated, ‘Let us have a deficit reduction trust fund.’ We have never followed that; we instead spent it.  I predict that if we raise these new taxes, we will spend them, also. We will not cut spending. We will spend it on new programs or expansion of existing programs”</p></blockquote>
<p>OK – but Federal spending as a share of GDP actually fell during the Clinton Administration.  Fast forward to the 2000 Presidential debate:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the 2000 presidential campaign, one of George W. Bush’s major themes was the need for a tax cut to reduce the budget surplus that had been accumulated during the Clinton administration. Again echoing the starve-the-beast theory, Bush argued against the virtues of a surplus, saying that it would only fuel additional spending &#8230; Despite the lack of evidence during the George W. Bush administration that tax cuts restrain spending increases, let alone cause spending to be cut, a number of leading conservative economists continue to insist on the basic correctness of the starve-the-beast theory, including Edward Lazear, who became chairman of the CEA under President Bush in May 2006 … many on the political left have long charged that the ultimate goal of starve-the-beast advocates has been to create a deficit so massive that entitlements &#8230; will have to be cut when a fiscal crisis finally emerges. In the words of Peter Beinart, editor of The New Republic: “It’s middle-class entitlements, however, such as Medicare and Social Security, which make the federal government so big (and so popular). And the GOP’s only hope of undermining them is to create a fiscal crisis so huge that now-unpopular Republican solutions, such as privatizing Social Security and turning Medicare into a voucher program, become politically feasible. In roughly a decade,<br />when multiple Bush tax cuts and an enormous defense buildup run smack into the baby-boom retirement, they might just get their wish” &#8230; This argument would have much more plausibility, however, if George W. Bush and a Republican Congress had not massively expanded Medicare spending in 2003 by adding a new prescription drug benefit to the program. Moreover, most Republican concern about federal spending these days tends to be channeled into demands that “pork-barrel” spending on public-works projects be curtailed, even though &#8211; perhaps because &#8211; it is a trivial component of overall spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>There you have a very good summary of the fiscal debate today.  While the GOP political leadership wants you to believe we can have this prescription drug benefit, larger defense budgets, and low tax rates simply by curbing pork-barrel spending – the numbers do not add up.  Even with fuzzy math – you can’t come close to justifying this kind of Bushian nonsense.  So what is the real agenda?  While big spending necessitates big taxes, this realism does not tell us who will ultimately pay all of these taxes.  Some conservatives who favor lower taxes on capital income are honest enough to propose other forms of taxation – such as Bruce’s idea to have a national Value-Added Tax.  </p>
<p>But most of the GOP political leadership is not as honest as Bruce.  They may prefer what I’ve called a Back Door Employment Tax Increase – that is, a cut in future Social Security benefits that exceeds any proposed reduction in payroll “contributions” and the alleged long-run Social Security shortfall.  While George W. Bush claims his privatization plan will make young workers better off, but simple finance tells us that this claim is nothing more than a big fat lie.  So the GOP leadership has decided to simply package this as “entitlement reform”.  And sadly, some economists including Greg Mankiw parrot these dishonest labels.  But let’s speak plain English – a plan to abuse the Social Security Trust Fund reserves to pay for cuts in taxes on capital income is a massive shift in taxation from capital income to employment income.  To do so by deception strikes me as Grand Larceny.  Of course, to tell young workers they’ll have to continue to pay high employment taxes as they get less in Social Security benefits could cost the GOP future elections.  Then again – robbers rarely call the bank president just before they decide to rob the bank.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post looks at the population 45 – 54 and how it changes over time, and whether that can explain some of the patterns in real median income we observe in Presidential administrations since Ike. Why population 45 – 54? Well, according to the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p08ar.html">Census</a>, that’s the income group making the most money. Thus, if demographics are the explanation for the extremely fast increase in real median income during the JFK/LBJ and Clinton administrations noted in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/real-median-income-by-presidential.html">my post on real median income</a>, presumably we’d expect to see much more of these prime-earning folks wandering around during those administrations than at other points. Similarly, given the drops in real median observed during the Carter, GHW, Nixon/Ford, and GW administrations, we’d expect to see a lower percentage of these high earning folks during those administrations. Of course, that’s all a big if.</p>
<p>Demographic data from 1980 to 2005 comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0011.xls">here</a>, and demographic data going back to 1952 was obtained from <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/pre-1980/PE-11.html">here</a>. Real median income also comes from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p07ar.html">Census </a>.</p>
<p>So here’s what the prime earning population as a percentage of the total population looks like over time.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RozyOTb6OBI/AAAAAAAAAYI/8JK1Dz1fsuc/s1600-h/Pop+45+-+54,+Graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RozyOTb6OBI/AAAAAAAAAYI/8JK1Dz1fsuc/s320/Pop+45+-+54,+Graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here’s a summary…</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RozcCjb6N-I/AAAAAAAAAXw/sVe-rYsyOd4/s1600-h/Pop+45+-+54,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RozcCjb6N-I/AAAAAAAAAXw/sVe-rYsyOd4/s320/Pop+45+-+54,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Well… Clinton did have a fastest growth rate in the high earning folks… so maybe some of his real median income performance is due to that. But he was followed by the Bush boys when it comes to growth rate in that prime earning demographic… and both were underperformers when it comes to real median income growth… and just about everything else we’ve looked at so far. JFK/LBJ, who posted the fasted growth rates in real median income, and Reagan, who followed JFK/LBJ and Clinton, both had decreases in this prime demographic.</p>
<p>It makes it hard to conclude that demographics are what’s driving the difference in performance we observed in real median income. A bit more formally…</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rozb8Tb6N9I/AAAAAAAAAXo/P04pwbhDIMI/s1600-h/Pop+45+-+54,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rozb8Tb6N9I/AAAAAAAAAXo/P04pwbhDIMI/s320/Pop+45+-+54,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And now a graph.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RozcIjb6N_I/AAAAAAAAAX4/fZ-TmdEst4A/s1600-h/Pop+45+-+54,+Graph+2.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RozcIjb6N_I/AAAAAAAAAX4/fZ-TmdEst4A/s320/Pop+45+-+54,+Graph+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So… is the excellent performance on real median income growth in the JFK/LBJ, Clinton, and to a lesser extent Reagan years explained by a veritable plethora of the prime demographic? Not much. Some of the dismal performance of Carter and Nixon/Ford might be due to a decrease in this prime demographic, but the Bush boys don’t even have that excuse. And if we look at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/this-post-looks-at-disposable-income-by.html">real disposable income less the increase in a person’s share of the national debt</a>, this demographic excuse gets even more shredded… </p>
<p>Conclusion… while real median income is affected a bit by demographics, its effect seems to be at the margin&#8230; when demographic conditions are abysmal, real median income growth rate is abysmal. But the performance of most Presidents doesn&#8217;t seem explainable by demographics.</p>

                                <p>In the wake of the recent attempted car bombings on London and Glasgow, reader Sammy sends along a link to <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=1038722007">this article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]e are confronted with the uneasy reality that our cosy assumptions about who becomes a terrorist and why have once again been shattered.</p>
<p>For most of us, the profile of the suicide bomber is not particularly complex: young, male (mostly), religiously devout, alienated, angry, disenfranchised, living on the edges of normal society, poorly integrated, and as a result, socially and psychologically outcast &#8211; what we assume is the perfect recipe for vulnerability to violent radicalisation.</p>
<p>But once again, and with more cases being uncovered across the country, these simplistic attributes we can only dismiss as naive and misleading. Evidence from research at the University of St Andrews tells us that not only has no terrorist profile been found, but that it is unlikely one ever will be. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We can easily identify what I have termed predisposing risk factors for involvement in terrorism. These include:</p>
<p>• Personal experiences of victimisation (which can be real or imagined);</p>
<p>• Expectations about involvement (for instance the lures &#8211; such as excitement, mission, sense of purpose &#8211; associated with being involved in any &#8220;insider&#8221; group and its various roles);</p>
<p>• Identification with a cause, frequently associated with some victimised community;</p>
<p>• Socialisation through friends or family, or being raised in a particular environment;</p>
<p>• Opportunity for expression of interest and steps towards involvement;</p>
<p>• Access to the relevant group.</p>
<p>It must be stated that individually none of these will ever help explain why people become terrorists but, taken in combination, they do provide a powerful framework for understanding why one person might become involved in terrorism and the other does not.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sammy goes on to note&#8230;</p>
<p>On the contrary, based on every spectacular terror attack on Western soil, and according to a former CIA operative who collected the life histories of almost 400 members of the <a href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/002391.php">deadly movement</a> :</p>
<blockquote><p>The stereotype that these terrorists are poor, desperate, single young men from Third World countries, vulnerable to brainwashing, is wrong, Dr. Marc Sageman told an international terrorism conference in Washington this week.</p>
<p>Most Arab terrorists he studied were well-educated, married men from middle- or upper-class families, in their mid-20s and psychologically stable, said Sageman, a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia . Many of them knew several languages and traveled widely.</p>
<p>But when they settled in foreign countries, they became lonely, homesick and embittered, he said. They felt humiliated by the weakness and backwardness of their homelands. They formed tight cliques with fellow Arabs and drifted into mosques more for companionship than for religion. Radical preachers convinced them it was their duty to drive Americans from Muslim holy lands, killing as many as possible. â€œ<br />â€œSageman served as a CIA case officer in Afghanistan from 1987 to 1989, running agents against the Soviet occupation. In a book, &#8220;Understanding Terror Networks,&#8221; published in May, he traced the roots of the movement to a centuries-old Islamic tradition dedicated to purifying Muslim lands of &#8220;infidels&#8221; and restoring the past glories of Islam.</p>
<p>He described al-Qaida and its global allies as &#8220;a violent Islamist social movement held together by an idea: the use of violence against foreign and non-Muslim governments or populations to establish an Islamist state in the core Arab region.&#8221;<br />For its members, terrorism is &#8220;an answer to Islamic decadence &#8211; a feeling that Islam has lost its way,&#8221; he said. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is backed up by a very <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=465570&#038;in_page_id=1770">authoritative source</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was a fanatic..I know their thinking, says former radical Islamist.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>I remember when we used to laugh in celebration whenever people on TV proclaimed that the sole cause for Islamic acts of terror like 9/11, the Madrid bombings and 7/7 was Western foreign policy. They also helped to draw away any critical examination from the real engine of our violence: Islamic theology. The foundation of extremist reasoning rest upon a model of the world in which your are either a believer or an infidel</p></blockquote>
<p>George Bush&#8217;s idealistic goal in Iraq is that freedom and democracy were the antidote to this. There is some logic <a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v49/i39/39b01001.htm">here</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[T]he only variable that was consistently associated with the number of terrorist was the Freedom House index of political rights and civil liberties. Countries with more freedom were less likely to be the birthplace of international terrorists. Poverty and literacy were unrelated to the number of terrorists from a country. Think of a country like Saudi Arabia : It is wealthy but has few political and civil freedoms. Perhaps it is no coincidence that so many of the September 11 terrorist and Osama bin Laden himself came from there.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, this seems like a longshot at this point.</p>
<p>If not stopped, the terrorists will get more and more powerful weapons, culminating with nuclear. Countries will be subjugated. How do we fight them?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/07/on-charlatons-and-cranks.html">Greg Mankiw</a> reminds us of what he said back on <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/mankiw_speech_nabe_20030915.html">September 15, 2003</a> and adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking back after four years, I think this holds up pretty well.</p></blockquote>
<p>After arguing that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts had desirable short-term Keynesian aggregate demand effects, the speech goes into the alleged long-run supply-side benefits.  I was scratching my head thinking “crowding-out” and lo and behold we finally got to see this wisdom:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, the expansionary effects of the tax cuts will be offset to some degree by the effects of the budget deficits that arise from lower revenues. Deficits can raise interest rates and crowd out of investment, although I should note that the magnitude of this effect is much debated in the economics literature. The main problem now facing the U.S. economy is not high interest rates, but at some point continued deficits would matter and could impede growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we go back to what the Federal Reserve was thinking by late 2003, they were already increasing interest rates.  Why?  Because they thought we were about to have a revival of investment demand with or without the 2003 tax cuts.  We were also seeing an increase in defense spending from the Iraq debacle and were also seeing a push for a very expensive prescription drug benefit.  In a word, the fiscal triple whammy that so concerned the CEA back in late 1965.  Then it was the 1964 tax cut, Vietnam, and the Great Society.  The CEA warned President Johnson that if fiscal stimulus was not reversed, the Federal Reserve would likely raise interest rates and crowd-out investment.  But Dr. Mankiw continued in his speech with:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is why, as the President has said, spending restraint is so vital.  The Administration would prefer not to have deficits, but deficit reduction is only one of many goals. Reversing the tax cuts today, as some have suggested, would depress growth and job creation. This is a matter of priorities: In the face of a shrinking or barely growing economy, an investment slowdown, and continued job losses, the President made growth and jobs his number one economic priority. There are others who think he should make deficit management the top priority – but the Administration does not share that point of view. Deficits are worrisome, but not as worrisome as an economy that is not growing and is rapidly shedding jobs. It is also important to be aware of how these deficits arose. About half of the change in the fiscal outlook since the President took office is attributable to the weak economy, including the stock market. About a quarter is due to higher expenditures, mainly on homeland security and defense. The last quarter is due to reduced revenue from the tax cuts. And these estimates are based on static scoring, so they surely overstate the role of the tax cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounded more like drinking from the Kool Aid than stern advice to a President who seemed hell bent on fiscal irresponsibility.  In his own words, Greg Mankiw unwittingly admits that the fiscal advice in 2003 was not on par with the fiscal advice offered to President Johnson in late 1965.  Of course, that advice went largely unheeded back in the late 1960’s.</p>
