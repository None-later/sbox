                            <div class="content">
                                <div>Last week, Dan posted what had been an email message I sent him in response to a link he’d sent me to an article by Thom Hartmann on Truthout about the Supreme Court’s infamous <i>Citizens United</i> opinion.  The key (consecutive) paragraphs of Hartmann’s piece, which I quoted in my email/post, were:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Most Americans don&#8217;t realize that the idea that “corporations are people” and “money is speech” are concepts that were never, ever considered or promoted or even passed by any legislature in the history of America. Neither were they ever promoted or signed into law by any president &#8211; if anything, the opposite, with presidents from Grover Cleveland in 1887 to Barack Obama in 2010 condemning them.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And Congress and the executive branch are the two of the three branches of government that are elected by the people, and thus the only two to which the founders of this country and the framers of the Constitution gave the right to create laws.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Supreme Court is so much not supposed to create law, that Article 3, Section 2 of the Constitution even says that it must operate “under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I said there are two problems with what Hartmann’s arguments—arguments that are being made by many others as well who are appropriately outraged by <i>Citizens United</i>and earlier corporate-free-speech Supreme Court opinions. 
</p>
</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>One problem, I wrote, is that there needs to be an explicit distinction made between the idea of “corporate personhood” in law, generally, and “corporate personhood” in a constitutional-rights sense.  I said that Hartmann and the others who have adopted this position, including the drafters of the current proposed constitutional amendment to negate <i>Citizens United</i> by declaring corporations non-persons, clearly intend that this apply only to the corporate-free-speech Supreme-Court-created laws.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I said that the “corporate personhood” fiction actually was created, I believe, simply as a practical way to allow corporations to own property, and that eventually that fiction enabled corporations to sue and be sued, to be subject to criminal laws and civil regulatory law and to be charged with violations of those laws and to be fined for violations and required by court order to comply with (say) a particular environmental or securities regulation or whatever.  I noted that state statutes, which provide for the creation of corporations, and federal statutes, which recognize corporations as legal entities, do provide for these things.  And although they don’t use the term “corporate person,” these laws (e.g., tax laws, environmental laws, lawsuit procedural laws) do include corporations in the statute’s “definitions” section, in defining the term “person,” in order to make clear that the statute or regulation does apply to corporations.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I then made the point that the problem of corporate personhood is not that the law, either statutory or court-created, treats corporations as legal entities that have legal rights and obligations, but instead that the Supreme Court has pronounced corporations “persons” for purposes of First Amendment speech rights.  Constitutional rights, I explained, apply only to persons.  In order to accord corporations First Amendment rights, the Court had to declare them persons—not mere legal entities in a statutory sense (as in say, corporations can own property), but persons—in a constitutional sense.  This, I said, is a really important distinction.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And it is.  A really important distinction. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The distinction gets complicated, though, I said, when you consider that there <i>are</i> some constitutional rights that most people would think do and should pertain to corporations: the Fourth Amendment’s guarantee against warrantless searches and seizures, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments’ due and property “takings” provisions, for example.  But that’s because actual people do own direct monetary shares of corporations, and so corporate property does belong to real people, and because the constitutional protections at issue there—against warrantless searches and seizures of documents, for example—would compromise those rights of real persons (the corporation’s employees or customers, for example).
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In other words, to the extent that the corporation—or union, or nonprofit political organization (the iconic example in legal opinions being the NAACP)—has constitutional, rather than mere statutory, rights, those rights are derivatives of the rights of the organization’s human members. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The First Amendment right to advocate for a particular political candidate or party or political position, using shareholders’ money is hardly a right that logically derives from those shareholders’ own First Amendment speech rights, I said.  “The exercise of those speech rights cannot reasonably be interpreted as intentionally collective among the shareholders; the specific expenditure is not foreseeable to shareholders, and many shareholders, whose politics differ from that of the CEOs, would be horrified by it if the transparency that Justice Kennedy so vaunted in the opinion actually existed and they knew about the corporation’s political role,” I wrote.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>My post was posted prematurely.  I’d intended to edit it before it was posted.  And, as I said in a comment I posted to the post, that comment needs clarification, because it implies inaccurately that corporate management normally lacks, or at least <i>should</i> lack, the legal authority to take actions that are unforeseeable to shareholders.  What I meant is that corporate management—and, regarding the use of corporate funds for political purposes of this sort, this presumably would be the CEO—should not be able to leverage the First Amendment speech rights of unwitting shareholders in so unforeseeable a respect. What <i>Citizens</i> <i>United</i> did was authorize corporate top management to leverage shareholders’ First Amendment speech rights and shareholders’ money for political campaign expenditures.  But unlike Goldman Sachs when lending leverage to Bain Capital, these shareholder political donors are captive ones.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Of course, the Fab Five majority in <i>Citizens United</i> did pretend otherwise.  But then, as I said in another earlier post on AB, declaring clearly-false facts in order to arrive at their chosen result in that case is the very hallmark of that opinion. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the comments to my earlier post that this post clarifies, there was some discussion about whether the remedy for an objecting shareholder is to simply sell the corporate stock.  But for that to be an option even just for people who own the stock directly rather than through a pension fund or mutual fund, the corporation would have to divulge to its shareholders its intent to make that expenditure.  Suffice it to say that corporations do not divulge the specifics of these expenditures, even after they’re made, much less beforehand.  And the sale on short notice may cause the shareholder to accept a financial less on the sale, all in order to prevent the derivative use of the individual’s First Amendment speech right never foreseeably conferred in the first place. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>This particular constitutional right, by its nature, should not transfer so artificially and unintentionally.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212;-
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>For readers who didn’t see my earlier post, and who are curious, I said that the other problem with what Hartmann and others are arguing is their claim that the courts have no authority to render decisions pronouncing rules of constitutional law.  I said, accurately, that this claim is profoundly dangerous.  I said it mirrors what Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia regularly claim, except of course when they themselves are fabricating some new rule of constitutional law.  As they did in <i>Citizens United</i>.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I also said I love Thom Hartmann, but that I think his position here needs some refinement.
</p>

<p> Finance moves transportation bill&#8211;revenue sources at issue  </p>
<p>Senate Finance committee approved on a 17-6 vote the transportation financing proposal (13 Dems and 5 GOP voting yes; the GOP were Snowe, Crapo, Roberts and Thune).<br />The GOP &#8211;Jon Kyl a favorite spokesperson&#8211;claimed that the Committee&#8217;s rush had &#8220;lost the opportunity to have a truly bipartisan deal.&#8221; See BNA Daily Tax RealTime 020712. What that means is that the GOP doesn&#8217;t like the revenue provisions in the bill (surprise). In particular, they don&#8217;t like the &#8220;black liquor&#8221; provisions (see my earlier post about that) and the pension provision.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the pension provision? It is expected to raise about $4.648 billion over ten years. It provides that inherited IRAs and 401(k)s must pay out (and therefore be taxed) over a 5 year period instead of over the expected life of the beneficiary, unless the beneficiary is the account holder&#8217;s age, a child with special needs, or past 70 years old. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Those Congressmen interested in protecting fat cat privileges can be expected to boo-hoo over the poor beneficiary who inherits a windfall of cash and, gee, has to pay tax as it gets paid to him over 5 years instead of getting to defer most of it by taking it into acccount over his lifetime. But taxing that to the beneficiary up front is clearly the right answer. The beneficiary did nothing to earn it. It is funds that have been accumulating over time in the IRa without tax. If beneficiaries are allowed to keep it in the IRA and continue the tax-free growth over most of their productive lives as well, they really receive a windfall&#8211;millions of tax free accumulation. See Richard Rubin, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-07/baucus-eyes-inherited-iras-to-raise-4-6-billion-for-treasury-over-decade.html">Senate Baucus Eyes Inherited IRAs for $4.6 Billion</a>, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 7, 2012).</p>
<p>As the Bloomberg story notes, the intended purpose of IRAs is as a retirement planning tool, not a way for wealthy estate holders to pass even more of the estate to beneficiaries essentially tax free. Ending that tax bonus makes sense. Not unexpectedly, estate planners don&#8217;t like the idea: one estate planner objected that this deal would be a &#8220;non-starter&#8221; because &#8220;there&#8217;s too much invested in the whole stretch IRA concept.&#8221; In other words, wealthy people like their perks, so the Congress won&#8217;t have the guts to eliminate a provision that made no sense as a policy provision from the outset!  </p>

                                <p>Any knowledgeable economist will tell you that GDP (or GDP/capita) is a profoundly imperfect and non-inclusive measure of national well-being.<br />In particular, GDP doesn’t count any work isn’t paid for with money — painting your mom’s house, volunteering for the Rotary Club or your church (David Brooks, are you listening?), caring for your kids and your friends’ kids, cooking dinner for your family — even though that work clearly “produces” immense quantities of real human value. (Can you say “family values”?)<br />A while back <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=189">I did a rough calc</a> (based on Census time-use surveys and median hourly wage) suggesting that counting unpaid work would increase U.S. GDP by something like a third (and I think that’s an underestimate.) Since Europeans have much more free time for unpaid work, counting it would presumably increase their GDP by an even greater percentage.<br />If this thinking holds water, you’d expect to see other measures of well-being giving very different readings from the GDP/capita measure.<br />You would be right. Kentaro Toyama <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/01/should-the-united-states-be-more-like-europe/251645/">laid out out ten other measures in <em>The Atlantic</em> last month</a>, all of which show the U.S. trailing European countries — often by quite dismaying amounts:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br /><img alt="" height="246" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/kentaro1.png" title="measures 1" width="554"><br /><img alt="" height="250" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/kentaro3.png" title="measures 2" width="485"><br />(ODA is official development assistance.)<br />The U.S. only stands out by one measure (and it’s still not #1) — GDP/capita — and that only if you calculate it by purchasing power parity. (How large a basket of goods would your share of GDP buy in different countries?)<br />Conservatives constantly point to the U.S.’s high GDP/capita to “prove” that their preferred model of unfettered capitalism and stripped-down government is superior in delivering national well-being.Even if they ignore all those other measures (which conservatives are happy to do, as with any facts that contradict their faith-based beliefs), their claims for GDP superiority themselves contradict their own beliefs.<br />Think about it: PPP adjustment — the procedure that’s necessary for conservatives to claim American exceptionalism by the one measure that they cling to — by its very nature asserts that currency exchange rates are <em>wrong</em> – that they’re not being properly arbitraged by the market to represent the “true” value of the different currencies in terms of real goods.<br />So yeah: America kicks everybody else’s ass (except Norway’s) — as long as you assume that markets are imperfect.<br /><em>Cross-posted at <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=5066">Asymptosis</a>.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>That&#8217;s Baloney</i>&#8221; stated Rep. Micky Hammon, R-Decatur, Alabama; the immigration bill cosponsor, told the Huntsville Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>It&#8217;s clear the study over estimates the negative and under estimates the positive to skew the result toward an agenda</i>,&#8221; Hammon said. &#8220;<i>If 40,000 illegal workers leave the state, they free up jobs that homegrown Alabamians are happy to have.&#8221;</i> <br /> <a href="http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/01/10290742-cost-of-alabama-immigration-law-disputed" target="_blank">The Cost of Alabama Immigration Law (H.B. 56) Disputed</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Alabama has the lowest unemployment rate among seven southeastern states,&#8221;</i> the spokeswoman for Governor Robert Bentley said.</p>
<p>I recently completed a quip to Senator Levin of Michigan who was commenting on the fall of the unemployment rate in Michigan and his plan to jump on the deficit reduction bandwagon at the same time. I thought by now most states and the relative &#8220;<i>pols</i>&#8221; would know a drop in U3 state wide or nationally does not necessarily mean an increase in employment. If the Civilian Labor Force drops in numbers because people give up looking for work, than it is possible for U3 to decrease. This is precisely what has happened in Alabama.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>People are dropping off unemployment rolls because they&#8217;ve become discouraged by not being able to find a job and have stopped looking, according to an analysis by Arise Citizens&#8217; Policy Project. Alabama&#8217;s labor force shrank by more than 6,000 workers in October, and the labor force has been shrinking since June. Economists say a shrinking labor force makes it easier for a state to post an unemployment rate decline, even if job growth is small.&#8221; &#8230;</i>&#8220;<i>Analysis shows a steep drop in the state&#8217;s unemployment rate isn&#8217;t because of Alabama&#8217;s overreaching immigration law&#8221;</i><br /><a href="http://blog.al.com/birmingham-news-commentary/2011/12/our_view_analysis_shows_a_stee.html" target="_blank">Birmingham News</a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />It appears kicking the illegal immigrants out of Alabama doesn&#8217;t do much for getting people back to work. Maybe those UAW jobs which did not require more than a high school education and a good work ethic were not as bad as some Senators made them out to be?</p>

<p>It appears those students who went to Law School, shelled out $100,000 or more to get the exclusive Juris Doctorate, and as a result expected to make the big bucks. They were sadly disappointed when they could not find a job even with the best of credentials. So what does a newly minted attorney to do? Of course, sue the School of Law which they attended for false advertising.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Adam Bevelacqua graduated from Brooklyn Law School last year with $100,000 in debt but high hopes for his future. He passed the bar on his first try in New York and had internships to highlight on his resume. And, according to his research, the school’s job placement rate for new graduates was between 90 to 95 percent. But Bevelacqua, 29, is no longer as optimistic.</i></p>
<p><i>“I’ve been looking for work ever since,” Bevelacqua told msnbc.com. “The jobs aren’t really there.”</i><br /><i>On Wednesday, Bevelacqua joined 50 other law school graduates from across the country who sued their alma maters, alleging they were misled about job prospects and burdened with huge amounts of student debt.&#8221;</i><br /><i><a href="http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/02/10302339-law-schools-face-lawsuits-over-job-placement-claims" target="_blank">MSNCB News</a> Law schools face lawsuits over job-placement claims</i></p>
<p>The state of Alabama and Jefferson County are in need of good and cheap attorneys to defend the H.B. 56 law and to process Jefferson County&#8217;s bankruptcy. The going rate right now is $1 million per month or enough to fund a few attorneys. Maybe the law labour has to relocate and go to where the demand is? Any takers???</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&#038;id=2989">2.3 million</a>: The number of people, including 1.3 million children, who were kept out of poverty by the child tax credit in 2009.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2011reports/201141061fr.html">$1,800</a>: The average amount claimed in child tax credits by ITIN filers in 2010.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/FoodPlans/2011/CostofFoodNov2011.pdf">3</a>: The number of months for which a family of four with two children could put food on the table using the average child tax credit refund under the Department of Agriculture’s “Thrifty Food Plan.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economy.com/dismal/article_free.asp?cid=224641&#038;tid=F0851CC1-F571-48DE-A136-B2F622EF6FA4&#038;src=MZ">$1.38</a>: The amount of economic growth that results from every $1 spent on child tax credits. Not all tax cuts are created equal, though. The payroll tax holiday results in $1.25 of economic growth for every $1 spent, while making the Bush tax cuts permanent would result in $0.35 per dollar.</p>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2011/12/15/389244/house-republicans-target-the-american-children-of-immigrants-in-punishing-payroll-tax-bill/">4 million</a>: The number of U.S.-born children whose families would be affected by the proposed offset.</p>
<p>20 percent: The amount of the payroll tax holiday extension that would be offset by raising taxes on lower-income immigrant parents of American children. The payroll tax holiday extension is worth $120 billion. The proposed legislation to offset the tax cut, however, will, by conservatives’ own calculations, save a total of only $24 billion over 10 years.</p>
<p><a href="http://immigrationimpact.com/2011/12/13/just-in-time-for-the-holidays-congress-moves-4-million-children-closer-to-poverty/">About $100 billion</a>: The amount of payroll taxes that will be contributed by ITIN filers over the next 10 years. These taxes contribute to the trust funds for Medicare and Social Security—programs from which immigrants will never recoup benefits because of their status.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71370.html">$21,240</a>: The average household income for ITIN filers claiming additional child tax credit refunds in 2010. This is less than half of the 2010 median household income in the United States of $49,445, and would mean that a family of four with two children was living below the poverty line. Latino children are more likely to be living in poverty than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Unfounded Obsession With the Greek Minimum Wage</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_07/02/2012_426483">Greek minimum wage</a> is apparently a point of contention between the Troika (ECB/EU/IMF) and the Greek government. T<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/world/europe/papademos-greek-premier-is-tested-in-impasse-with-lenders.html">he NY Times</a> cites competitiveness gains as a rationale for the minimum wage cut:<br />
<blockquote><em><strong>The goal of any pay cuts would be to help make Greek workers, who are generally less productive than workers elsewhere in Europe, </strong>able to compete more effectively inside the euro zone, where countries share a common currency that does not allow devaluations to help even out differences in labor costs.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Huh? See below. The going line seems to be that the Greeks are lazy. They earn minimum government-negotiated wages without actually doing a whole lot because they’re uncompetitive. This is wrong; the data do not support this view.<br />First, the Greek people aren’t lazy at all. <em>In fact, Greek workers spent more hours working 2010 (in annual hours actually worked per worker) than those </em>in Chile, Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, Estonia, Turkey, Mexico, Slovak Republic, Italy, the US, New Zealand, Japan, Portugal, Canada, Finland, Iceland, Australia, Ireland, Slovenia, Spain, the UK, Sweden, Luxembourg, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands – <em>and in that order</em>. (You can <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/27/48622469.xls">download and view the data</a> from the OECD 2011 Employment Outlook.) <a href="http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2012/01/greek-german-work-hours-compared.html">Marc Chandler also highlighted </a>this fact back in January.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Sure, one could argue that the Greek workers work a lot of hours, but it’s for less output. Furthermore, labor costs have risen substantially relative to other Euro area countries, so the country’s worse off. That’s the uncompetitiveness route. If you care about productivity and relative wage gains, why not look at the drop in Greece’s relative unit labor costs?<br />The chart below illustrates the average accumulated gain/loss <em>in nominal labor costs (labor costs per hour)</em> across the EA 12 in the run-up to the crisis, 2005-2008, and then since the recession, 2009-Q32011 (Finland data unavailable). By this measure, Greece is certainly doing what the Troika want of it: relative devaluation in nominal labor costs. Since 2009, Greek labor costs have fallen 5.3%.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/ulc_chart3.jpg"><img alt="" height="500" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/ulc_chart3.jpg" width="600"></a></p>
<p>(<em>Note: <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database#">the data </a>are constructed as the percentage gain/loss of the average 2008 quarterly labor costs over the average of 2005 labor costs versus the average of Q4 2010 to Q3 2011 labor costs over the average 2009 quarterly labor costs, all working-day adjusted.</em>)</p>
<p>French and Austrian labor costs appreciated 12% and 10.7%, respectively, spanning 2005-2008, and another 5.7% and 4.0%, respectively, since 2009. In Ireland, the 1.8% average reduction in labor costs since 2009 pales in comparison to the 2005-2008 14.7% surge. Greece saw a lower accumulated gain in labor costs spanning 2005-2008 than most countries and cut labor costs since 2009. The ‘wage’ cost anger towards Greece seems to be misdirected.</p>
<p>Now I’m really wondering what is this obsession with the Greek minimum wage? True, the Greek minimum wage did rise 0.8% spanning 2010-2011 (you can <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database#">see Eurostat data here</a>). However, as a proportion of average monthly earnings, the 2010 minimum wage in Greece is roughly in line with other program countries, Ireland and Portugal, and lower than that in France, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Only in 2011 do Greece’s policies stick out when monthly minimum wage as a proportion of average monthly earnings surged to 50.1%. However, simple calculations demonstrate that for Greece the higher 2011 ratio of minimum wage to average monthly earnings was largely a function of falling average monthly earnings, -18.7%, rather than the rise in the minimum wage, +0.8%.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/min_wage_chart.jpg"><img alt="" height="500" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/min_wage_chart.jpg" width="600"></a></p>
<p>Perhaps I am not understanding things clearly here – I am sure that you all will correct me if I am not – but what’s this obsession with minimum wages? It looks to me like the fiscal austerity driven recession is indeed resulting in a reduction in Greece’s relative labor costs irrespective of minimum wage policy. Isn’t that the point?</p>

                                <p>Yesterday there was a post about the participation rate that displayed a widespread misunderstanding of what the data actually shows.</p>
<p>The labor force and the participation rate have been falling since the great recession. The following table shows that for the last three years the participation rate and the labor force have been falling when long term population growth suggest that they should grow some 1%  to 2% annually.   In 2009 and 2010 employment actually fell, so essentially all of the fall in the unemployment rate from 10% in late 2009 to 9% in mid-2011 was due to the labor force contracting.  During 2011 both employment and the labor force started growing, so that  recent declines in the unemployment rate stemmed from both growing employment  and  a growing labor force.  In January, the data was corrected to account for more recent census data that showed more rapid growth in the population and employment than had previously been estimated.  But the historic data was not changed, so the January data represent a break in the data and is not exactly comparable to earlier data.</p>

<p>But if you look at the data you can see that the participation rate  actually started falling around  the 1990 recession, so that the recent drops were just a more serious continuation of a trend that began some 20 years ago.</p>

<p>If you go back over a longer period you can see that the male participation rate has been falling from 86.6 in 1948 to 70.3 currently.  The decline in the male participation has been more severe since the great recession but it is not a new trend. Much of the decline in male participation was the changing economy where  the blue collar jobs that uneducated males traditionally filled have disappeared. Until the 1990 recession the drop in the male participation rate had  been offset by a rising female participation rate.   The recent drop in the female participation is due to both demographic factors &#8212; the baby boomers maturing &#8212; and the poor economy.  Exactly how much is due to each factor is being debated.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-95W78YL05w0/TzP34Qy4bhI/AAAAAAAAB_Q/ABpy1qp3RAQ/s1600/Clipboard01%2BB.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-95W78YL05w0/TzP34Qy4bhI/AAAAAAAAB_Q/ABpy1qp3RAQ/s320/Clipboard01%2BB.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The other way to look at the changing participation rate is to look at it by age brackets. Looked at this way there have been two major changed in the participation rate.  One is the falling rate for teens and young adults.  This has been falling since about 1980 and academic economist have been studying it for years.  The overwhelming conclusion has been  that it was due primarily to education, in that youths found the opportunity cost of working rather than improving their education and/or preparation for college was too high.  Some would say it was the minimum wage, but I find their arguments unpersuasive.  The other big change has been the rising participation of older &#8212; over 55 &#8212; workers.  This more recent development and yet to received as much attention from economist.  I  suspect that a major factor behind the increased participation of seniors is the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement packages.  As a consequence more and more seniors have found they could not afford to retire as early as previous generations had.</p>

<blockquote>This agreement is very significant in how it addresses the fraud that these banks committed against many homeowners across our state,” said ___.“ This agreement not only provides much needed relief to (STATE) [Ha ha, fill in the blank!!!] borrowers, but it also puts a stop to many of the bad [criminal] behaviors that contributed to the mortgage mess in our state and across the country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Addresses the fraud is part of the news announcement?</p>

                                <p>This article caught my attention mainly because I hadn&#8217;t heard much about the court battles on <a href="http://www.dodbuzz.com/2010/09/28/supreme-court-takes-up-a-12-case/">terminating funding for the A-12</a> because I thought it was done.  But the inability of DOD to submit documentation that might justify that the A-12 was not viable due to classified and secret information and specs made an impression on me as a catch-22 of funding for non-viable projects&#8230;making it horribly difficult to &#8216;learn from mistakes&#8217; so to speak.     </p>
<p>Here is a response from ilsm to my sending him the link:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dan,</p>
<p>The A-12 a blast from the past!     </p>
<p>I believe the Supreme Court last year decided the Navy/US Government would not be paid back “progress payments” paid prior to the termination of the A-12 sometime in the early 1990’s.     Here is an article form Feb 1999 about the case as it stood then, it kept going until 2010!     </p>
<p><a href="http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1999-02/12-legacy-it-wasnt-airplane-it-was-train-wreck">http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1999-02/12-legacy-it-wasnt-airplane-it-was-train-wreck</a></p>
<p>I had read the linked article years ago and am surprised to find it.  In the past 8 or so years I have only kept up with the A-12 headlines, when I saw them.     The A-12 was a stealthy fighter concept, a carrier based version much different [of course] to the already retired F-117.  Purportedly, the free world depends on things like the A-12.        </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />The interesting issue to me is why then Sec Def Cheney terminated the contract for “convenience”, a termination used when the service decides it does not need the equipment.     The Navy’s acquisition approach was to have Mc Donald Douglas (now owned by Boeing) build 12 of the A-12’s for test and evaluation.  The technology was risky and the specifications challenging, for example they had to keep the weight under 80,000 pounds which was the limits of the elevators on aircraft carriers and likely a big deal to beef them up (maybe the decks cannot handle the load of the landings either).</p>
<p>I am neither an expert in stealth nor an expert in aircraft carriers, mostly Air Force.  The contract type for this risky development was “fixed price”, which means Mc Donald Douglas signed up to deliver the 12 airplanes at a specification at a set time and contract price.  In order words the contractors assumed al the risk.     </p>
<p>As it happens today, and then Mc Donald Douglas promised to “name the song in 5 notes”, but needed about 20 special notes not on contract, they kept the Navy at bay, who would have done some insider contracting “magic” to raise the price until a contract auditor discovered the A-12 would not get any airplanes in the time and money Mc Donald Douglas had entered into the contract to deliver.</p>
<p>   George HW Bush was president and his advisors had some interest in cutting DoD spending [FY 91 spending had declined to 475B from 553B in 1989 a decline which was disrupted by the first Gulf war, but hit $400B in 2011 dollars in 1999] and finding new ways to do acquisition which was as much a mess as today.  </p>
<p>So, through a fair amount of trading and evading it was decided to <em>terminate for convenience</em>.  The better <em>termination was for default</em>, and I do not know why Cheney directed the type of termination, nor why a Navy contracting authority would not set him straight.     </p>
<p>Cheney could have done three things, one being convenience.  He could have terminated for “default”, which they were doing, or he could have called Mc Donald Douglas in and said:  “a contract is a bond, do the job [which is impossible given the traditional ineptitude of defense contractors].     The point in Fensler’s article, which is valid today, is that the Navy needed Mc Donald Douglas and would have (without the publicity) kept shoveling good money after bad for  the A-12, (like the AF did F-22 and now F-35).     The good thing is despite the fact the government does not get its progress payments back, the Navy has not been saddled for twenty years and likely $200B in costs to try and make the A-12 fly, a burden the USAF has successfully held up so their generals could have good jobs…</p>
<p>…     Bottom line from the Supremes:  the military industrial complex does not get real contracts, as in common law, they get paid whether they meet their promises or not.</p></blockquote>
