                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The latest on the massive General Fund deficit from <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/08/ytd-increase-in-national-debt-5116.html">CalculatedRisk</a> harkens back to the writings of by E. Cary Brown in the 1950’s where he noted that the actual deficit depends both on the state of fiscal policy and the size of the GDP gap.  During a return to full employment, it is possible for the actual deficit to decline even as the structural deficit rises.  </p>
<p>If one goes back about four years, the argument that part of the deficit was attributable to being below full employment was quite plausible.  But when I heard Robert Novak declare that we had a structural surplus during a Capital Gang episode aired late in 2002, I had to question where he got such an absurd notion.  Later I realized that Novak was relying on <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow112202.asp">The Deficit Dance</a> where Lawrence Kudlow starts with the unified deficit and then tries to estimate the GDP gap by what would have been a sensible procedure had he averaged the 6 to 7 quarters of annualized GDP gap figures rather than summed them.  For anyone to think the GDP gap was $2 trillion in 2002 is beyond dumb. Of course, the current archived version was editted to read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cumulatively, over the past two years, the loss of potential GDP comes to $1.95 trillion — a considerable amount.</p></blockquote>
<p>But even this figure is not valid as his own procedure of estimating the GDP gap would have produced a figure that was less than $400 billion per year.  Also note that Kudlow did not extend this edit down to the next paragraph as he took his 18% taxrate and multiplied it not by $1 trillion but by almost $2 trillion to get his alleged $350 billion plus per year loss in tax revenues.  </p>
<p>After one&#8217;s head stops spinning at all of this Kudlow Konfusion, let&#8217;s ask what is the GDP gap today?  Some economists argue it is zero, which would mean the structural deficit equals the current deficit.  A few of us think there is a small output gap, but that would still mean a large structural deficit that is not going to be closed by fiscal stimulus.  Now you might wonder why CalculatedRisk and I would argue for long-term fiscal restraint given the possibility of an upcoming recession.  Actually, I’m hoping for a return to the aggregate demand policies of 1993 where the fiscal authorities convinced the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates with a promise of gradual fiscal restraint.  Alas, the current macro-mix is just the opposite.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Angrybear has managed to attract as guest bloggers two Republicans who belong to the Reality Base Community and care about fiscal responsibility: <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/08/ytd-increase-in-national-debt-5116.html">CalculatedRisk</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/07/new-sound-in-echo-chamber.html">Andrew Samwick</a>.   At times, Dr. Samwick and I have agreed on issues and we both happened to be drinking beer in some pub in the British Isle when America hosted the <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2006/07/world-cup-apathy.html">World Cup</a>.   There was one difference – Dr. Samwick was enjoying a pint in a London pub, which had to lament the fact that the English team did not make the 1994 World Cup – whereas I was enjoying several pints in a Dublin pub as Ireland beat Italy in the opening game.  Dr. Samwick and may have also differed a bit on the strength of the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/07/we-used-to-call-it-underemployment.html">labor market</a> so maybe our exchanges could become scripts for the worthy opponent segments of the Colbert Report (my favorite half hour on TV).  </p>
<p>But his opening contribution to this blog had this very sensible suggestion:  <br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;ll agree and go one step further: if someone can convince me that we should have a minimum wage law, then the further argument that it should be indexed to inflation would be an easy one for me to accept.</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to take this statement a couple of steps further.  The <a href="http://www.epinet.org/issueguides/minwage/figure1.pdf">Economic Policy Institute</a> provides a nice chart of the real value of the minimum wage.  In the late 1950’s, its value represented about $6 an hour in 2006$ term – while it reached almost $8 an hour in 1968.  I’m sure liberals would love to index its value to the latter, while conservatives might prefer the former if not the current $5.15 value.  If the compromise to set the real value closer to $7 an hour – perhaps liberals should declare victory.  </p>
<p>But I have a question as to which price index should be used for the indexation.  While consumer prices today are 2.28 times what they were 25 years ago, the GDP deflator is only double its level in early 1981.  So had we indexed the minimum wage to the GDP deflator in 1981, its real value would still have declined somewhat relative to the consumer price index.  Indexing to the consumer price index, on the other hand, shifts terms of trade risk to businesses.  Given the possibility that we will have to experience a real devaluation in order to reduce the current account deficit, which index we choose may make a significant difference.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_08/009275.php">Kevin Drum</a> has some interesting “noodling” over the possibility that the COLA system of indexation has effectively been a floor for median wages.  This is certainly worth the read – even if you are like me in thinking market forces drive wages.</p>

<blockquote>Could it also be that world stock markets are rallying as Israel and its freedom agenda advances toward a Hezbollah-free Lebanese border, highlighting a significant defeat not only of the thuggish and cowardly Hezbollah murderers, but their totalitarian backers in Syria and Iran? At the close of business last Friday &#8211; after another violent week in the Middle East &#8211; Bloomberg chronicled the impressive performance of world stock markets: U.S. share prices had their best gain since November 2004; Canadian and European stocks had their top weekly performances all year; British and Brazilian equities rose for the second straight week; Asian stocks posted their strongest gain in over a month; Japan was up 3.5 percent; and India surged near 6 percent. The wartime stock market is saying that things might be better than most people believe.</p></blockquote>
<p>As you gag or scream or whatever at this blatant moral depravity, let’s review the facts at least in terms of U.S. share prices by looking at a chart of the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=%5EGSPC&#038;t=3m">S&#038;P 500</a>.  This tragedy started three weeks ago and the market has not shown any net gain.  So Kudlow’s lack of any moral center is eclipsed by his lack of knowledge of what’s happening in the market place.  </p>
<p>Even though <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002389.html">Max Sawicky</a> mocks them, the Cato crowd ranks Israel in 50th place with a 6.7 in terms of their “economic freedom scores” as compared to the U.S. 3rd place ranking with a 8.2 score and those socialist French getting a 6.9 score for ranking #38.  So I’m not sure who to believe – Kudlow who thinks Israel troops entering Lebanon is spreading freedom or that Cato “rilly scientific index”.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/theplank?pid=28207">Jonathan Chait</a> reads Kudlow and writes:<br />
<blockquote>Seriously, Kudlow really is arguing that the war is causing the markets to surge. You really need to read his whole column to get the whole flavor … I should remind the readers that Kudlow is not just some raving nut sitting in a windowless room. He writes about economics for National Review and hosts a talk show on CNBC. In other words, he&#8217;s a raving nut who enjoys prestigious platforms to disseminate his views.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why anyone would give Kudlow a platform is beyond me given the fact that the markets are not surging as well as the fact that Kudlow rarely gets anything right regarding economics or financial markets.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_08/009270.php">Kevin Drum</a> reacts to the latest speech from <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?dist=newsfinder&#038;siteid=google&#038;guid=%7BC0D131AE-7A4A-49A5-9847-491F69D619A0%7D&#038;keyword=">Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson</a>: <br />
<blockquote>We&#8217;ve had economic growth and strong productivity gains for the last 30 years or so, but we still don&#8217;t have the promised increases in take-home pay. So here&#8217;s an idea: In the same way that waiting another six months for progress in Iraq is now called a &#8220;Friedman,&#8221; perhaps another decade waiting for increases in take-home pay should be called a &#8220;Paulson.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin was reacting to this:<br />
<blockquote>Paulson said the slow growth in take-home pay was simply an economic reality &#8220;and it is neither fair nor useful to blame any political party.&#8221; &#8220;Rather than playing the blame game, we must focus on helping workers move up the economic ladder,&#8221; Paulson said. The best approach is to give people access to first-rate education so they can acquire the skills needed to advance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Except Kevin did not include the last sentence.  I think most liberals would agree with the need for better funding for first-rate education for all American children, but wouldn’t that require either a tax increase or more Federal borrowing?  Speaking of the massive Federal deficit, let’s turn to the beginning of the linked story:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I have always tried to live by the philosophy that when there is a big problem that needs fixing, you should run towards it, rather than away from it,&#8221; Paulson told the Columbia University business school, his first speech since taking office on July 10.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the General Fund deficit is a massive problem, which will require reversing the Bush tax cuts if we are also to fund education.  But what does Paulson want to discuss – Social Security.  A while back, I outsourced the responsibility for addressing the Social Security debate to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/07/were_going_to_g.html">Mark Thoma</a> who notes that John Boehner wants to get serious about something – but what?  Perhaps the GOP is getting serious about their goal of imposing <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/andrew-sullivans-backdoor-employment.html">backdoor employment tax increases</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The other fiscally responsible <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/08/paulson-no-recession.html">Republican Angrybear</a> beat me to the punch:<br />
<blockquote>Of course the major fiscal problems facing the U.S. are the structural general fund budget deficit and Medicare, not Social Security. So Paulson might be running towards the wrong problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said – CalculatedRisk!</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;m happy to report that Andrew Samwick, Dartmouth professor and proprietor of <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/">Vox Baby</a>, has agreed to periodically post here at Angry Bear. Prof. Samwick&#8217;s research focuses on finance, pensions, and Social Security, and his knowlege and interests range beyond those topics.</p>
<p>Also, as some readers may already know from visiting his blog, or divined from the title of this post, he&#8217;s also a Republican (be polite!). I respect his opinion and trust his numbers, even when I disagree with his conclusions. I think we&#8217;ll all benefit from encountering differing views, reasoning, and conclusions from time to time. Ideally, this will turn out to be a more erudite and interactive version of <a href="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/60minutes/60minutes.htm">Point-Counterpoint</a> (AB, you ignorant #$%$!).</p>
<p>So without further ado, I present the first installment of our new &#8220;View From The Right&#8221; feature, on the timely subject of raising the minimum wage.  (Here&#8217;s a quick response: we need a minimum wage in spite of, and in addition to, the EITC in large part because the former is viewed by the public as money earned whereas the latter is seen as a handout. This is related to but different from the point below about the EITC showing up as an expense on the federal budget.)</p>

<h3>      Minimum Wage Hikes        </h3>
<p>                          by <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/">Andrew Samwick</a></p>
<p>Congress is considering a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/07/28/minimumwage.ap/index.html" target="_blank">hike</a> in the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 over three years, but only if it is tied to other legislation that reduces taxes:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8212; Republican leaders are willing to allow the first minimum wage increase in a decade but only if it&#8217;s coupled with a cut in inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates, congressional aides said Friday.</p>
<p>A package GOP leaders planned to bring to a vote Friday or Saturday in the House also would renew several popular tax breaks, including a research and development credit for businesses, and deductions for college tuition and state sales taxes, said a spokesman for House Majority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/07/boudreaux-on-minimum-wage.html" target="_blank">Greg Mankiw</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/07/gop-ties-minimum-wage-hike-to-tax-cuts.html" target="_blank">Angry Bear</a>, and <a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/07/adjust-for-inflation-minimal-demand-on.html" target="_blank">Dean Baker</a> all have worthwhile posts on the issue.  I&#8217;ll take them in reverse order.</p>
<p>Dean argues that when the minimum wage is reported at two different points in time, it should be adjusted for inflation.<br />
<blockquote>This means that when an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/27/AR2006072701170.html">article</a> tells readers that a bill in Congress will raise the minimum wage to $7.15 an hour in 2007, from 5.15 an hour at present, it would be helpful to tell readers that this is equal to approximately $5.32 in 1997 dollars, the year the last minimum wage hike took full effect. This means that minimum wage workers would get about a 3.0 percent increase in real wages from 1997 to 2007, if this bill was approved.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll agree and go one step further: if someone can convince me that we should have a minimum wage law, then the further argument that it should be indexed to inflation would be an easy one for me to accept. That&#8217;s a big if, though, to which I&#8217;ll return in a moment.</p>
<p>PGL of Angry Bear is upset about the coupling of tax breaks for higher income households with the vote on the minimum wage:<br />
<blockquote>Secondly, these “tax cuts’ are nothing more than tax shifts. Someone at some point will have to pay down all these deferred tax liabilities.</p>
<p>The Democratic response is to call for “an up or down vote” (as much as I hate to quote Bill Frist) on the minimum wage proposal. There is absolutely no excuse for the continued fiscal irresponsibility of this Republican led Federal government – regardless of one’s view on the minimum wage controversy.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll agree with him in spirit but not entirely. I am repeatedly disappointed with the failure to balance the on-budget account over the business cycle. Spending (in my view) needs to be cut dramatically, and if there is no political will to do so, then revenues certainly should not be cut.</p>
<p>But there is another element here that&#8217;s worth considering. Greg Mankiw notes, and I fully agree, that even if the minimum wage doesn&#8217;t substantially reduce low-wage employment, it is a poorly targeted policy to alleviate poverty:<br />
<blockquote>What the facts show is that the minimum wage is poorly targeted as an anti-poverty program. Moreover, while the evidence is controversial, some studies find significant long-term adverse effects. As a result, most economists prefer more efficient and better targeted anti-poverty tools, such as the EITC, which has grown significantly over the past few decades.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you want to make sure that household heads are above poverty, then make a program directly for them and them alone. That&#8217;s the EITC. Compared to the minimum wage, the EITC allows us to condition on total hours worked and family status in redistributing income. By all means, argue for its expansion if you want to help low-income heads of household. (And, if you are Dean Baker, include its impact in your comparisons of after-tax income over time.)</p>
<p>Basically, I won&#8217;t support an increase in the minimum wage until I hear the explanation of why we need a minimum wage if we have an EITC.</p>
<p>One interesting note that I heard while in Washington a few years ago was that Congress used to prefer the minimum wage hike to the EITC because the minimum wage didn&#8217;t specifically cost the government any revenue in its budget forecasts but the EITC did. The story continues that one change that was implemented in the way the minimum wage legislation was discussed is that it would likely be coupled with tax reductions that softened its impact on small businesses. At the time, I thought this was enlightened policy making&#8211;there was now no budgetary reason to favor the minimum wage hike over something like the EITC.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s disappointing here to see that the tax reductions being proposed here really don&#8217;t have anything to do with small business per se, so the word &#8220;enlightened&#8221; certainly doesn&#8217;t apply. If this minimum wage hike goes through, it should be coupled with tax reductions for small businesses, and those tax reductions should be &#8220;paid for&#8221; in the budget by reductions in spending elsewhere in the budget.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>It’s sad when one has to keep turning to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underemployment#Underemployment_defined_as_underutilization_of_skills">Wikipedia</a>: <br />
<blockquote>In one usage, underemployment describes the employment workers with high skill levels in low-wage jobs that do not require such abilities. For example, someone with a college degree may be tending bar or driving a cab or being a cashier. Alternatively, a skilled machinist may be working at a fast-food outlet. This may result from the existence of unemployment, which makes workers with bills to pay (and responsibilities) take almost any jobs available, even if they do not use their full talents.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is what I thought about as I read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/31/business/31men.html?ex=1311998400&#038;en=81184a612143ae81&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">this story</a>.  <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2006/07/men-not-working.html">Andrew Samwick</a> reads this story and writes:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s hard to know if the unemployment rate is really &#8220;missing&#8221; them in measuring the strength of the labor market.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Samwick has been suggesting that at least some of the decline in the labor force participation rate is due to voluntary forces, while I have been emphasizing the alleged continued weakness in labor markets due to poor aggregate demand management.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/2006/07/post_981.html#004958">Ezra Klein</a> first noted:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s always hard to discern if the anecdotes and quotes chosen for these articles accurately reflect the trends</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, he continues:<br />
<blockquote>The basic outline is that many workers from blue or gray collar jobs who lost their positions in layoffs and bankruptcies are finding it nearly impossible to find subsequent positions offering the same level of dignity and challenge.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YjI3MzM3ZWY4YTRkYTc2NjVmZTFjOTc1NDE0NjIxNGU=">Jonah Goldberg</a> is quick to agree.  I guess it would not occur to Mr. Goldberg that we should be expecting more from our labor market.  After all, expecting more would be to suggest that George W. Bush’s economic policies are not as wonderful as Mr. Goldberg and his cronies are paid to portray.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_Razor">Wikipedia</a> has a nice discussion of Occam’s razor.  <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=Yjk4NmMwYTQyYTk3ZWM2MjlkOGIxMWE5OWE3MzY2MDE=">John Tamny</a> would have had a decent op-ed if he had applied it.  Since I’m usually quite critical of Tamny’s writings, let me start with where we agree:<br />
<blockquote>Workers are in the end capital, and along the lines of the pin factory Adam Smith described in the Wealth of Nations, an increase in the number of skilled workers will increase output, and make all of us wealthier in the end. Notably, some in favor of increasing H1-B caps engage in zero-sum thinking of a different kind. Their view is that if we refuse skilled foreign workers, we’ll fall behind countries such as China and India, which already possess high numbers of scientists and engineers. The flaw here is in the assumption that the U.S. economy is a closed one, and that innovations in other countries will make us less well off at home. If this were true, California and New York, not to mention Europe and the rest of the world, would have been impoverished for the fact that Microsoft was founded in Seattle. More realistically, Microsoft’s innovations made workers around the world more productive. Economic advances, be they scientific or technological, are almost by definition worldwide advances to the extent that countries keep their markets open and free. If a cure for cancer is found in India, we’ll all be better off. Country origin, in a free global market, is irrelevant.</p></blockquote>
<p>Agreed!  But here is where I’d apply Occam’s razor:<br />
<blockquote>The H1-B program thus should not be expanded with nationalistic concerns in mind, but for the simple fact that the U.S. remains the single best place for entrepreneurs to achieve their goals. The U.S. is a magnet for capital, perhaps because of the enlightened thinking of the average American.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether this statement is true or not – it is also irrelevant to the case Tamny is making.  Consider, for example, the life science sector where R&#038;D is being done not just in the United States, but also in Canada, Europe, and Japan.  I have no reason to believe American scientists are better at this type of R&#038;D than scientists in other nations.  And quite frankly, I don’t care.  If a Canadian or Japanese scientist finds a cure of the common cold, I can buy that cure in the global market place.  And if a scientist needs government funding for stem cell research, he’s more likely to find that funding abroad than in George Bush’s America.</p>

When I read this, I was at a lost for sensible discussion not knowing whether the laugh out loud or to scream beyond control.  So let’s give the microphone to <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/009247.php">TPM Reader DK</a>:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s not necessary to parse the substance of Rove&#8217;s fatuous comments. We all know how preposterous any of this is coming from Rove. And it&#8217;s certainly not the first time the GOP has attacked the media as a way of working the refs, which is exactly the purpose of those particular remarks. But I am struck by Rove&#8217;s remarks as another example, among many in recent months, that most of the reliable campaign themes the Republicans have employed in the last two decades are no longer viable. National security policy is in a shambles, the federal budget is a wreck, and the GOP&#8217;s reputation for bringing mature and competent managers to government may take a generation to rebuild. Thematically, only social issues still resonate. That leaves the GOP with two main tactical weapons: demonizing opponents personally and shooting the messenger. Over the next four months, we will see blistering negative attacks on Democrats of a ferocity and corrosiveness that will make Swift Boats look like the Love Boat. And we will see a continuation of what started in the spring, an unprecedented attack on journalists and journalism, using not only the rhetorical flourishes favored by Rove, but the powers of the state via investigations, subpoenas, and the invocation of state secrets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the rest if you are concerned as DK and I am about the future of our democracy.</p>

<blockquote><p>Wait a minute.  Aren&#8217;t we going just a little bit overboard here?  After all, we are talking about 2-1/2 percent growth hot on the heels of 5 percent plus.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have complained about how the Bush cheerleaders often tout one quarter’s bit of noise as proof that their free lunch supply-side silliness is serious economics.  So fair is fair.  But why focus on a period of only 0.5 years as opposed to the last 5.5 years?  Real GDP for 2006QII was about 15.15% higher than it was at the end of 2000 so growth has averaged only 2.6% per year since the beginning of this century.  Contrast that to the average 3.5% per year growth experienced during the second half of last century.  </p>
<p>Just remember to focus on the average growth rate rather than the noise the next time some goofball like <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODFkZTRjNzVmODNiMGIzNmUzZWVjODE2MzA4YWU5ZWY=">this fellow</a> tries to convince you that this is the most amazing growth ever experienced in human history:</p>
<blockquote><p>the economy hit a 4.6 percent annual growth rate in the second quarter of 2006</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right – those National Review nuts don’t even know the difference between nominal GDP growth and real GDP growth.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Given how late am I to the party in terms of discussing <a href="http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/treasurydynamicanalysisreporjjuly252006.pdf">A Dynamic Analysis of Permanent Extension of the President’s Tax Relief</a>, I’m thankful that <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/07/a_teachable_mom.html">David Altig</a> summarized the economist blog discussion on this dynamic scoring debate.  David, however, dumped on my favorite summary, which was provided by <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/07/a_syllogism_abo.html">Brad DeLong</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>What proportion of students will be able to follow the syllogism?</p>
<p>• Tax relief is good for growth only if the tax reductions are financed by spending restraint. </p>
<p>• The Bush tax reductions have been financed not by spending restraint but by borrowing.</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<p>• The Bush tax reductions have been bad for growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what is David’s rebuttal?<br />
<blockquote>I hope the answer is none, because one of the premises is irrelevant.  The question is not have the tax cuts been financed by spending cuts, but rather will they be financed by spending cuts.   Brad&#8217;s expectation may be reasonable given the politics of the situation, but you obviously cannot draw conclusions by assuming a condition that has yet to be determined.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, David may have a point – and in fact, his point is critical to the premise that tax cuts might encourage a small bit of extra growth once one actually digests the incredible bait and switch in this Treasury document.</p>
<p>For example, this document vacillates between the two contradictory explanations for the Bush tax cuts as it says on the one hand we needed the tax cuts to spur more consumption (= less savings) in order to generate an increase in Keynesian aggregate demand to rescue us from that recession, while on the other hand, it claims the tax cuts increased national savings.  OK, Lawrence Lindsey played Keynesian in 2001, while Glenn Hubbard played classical economists – and the political hacks in the White House refused to recognize that the President’s two economic advisors were contradicting each other. </p>
<p>But let’s concede that this document says over and over that the key is future reductions in government spending as it admits that if these tax cuts are really tax shifts that will necessitate future tax increases, then they will lead to less growth in the long-run.  Page 10 even utters the word foreign to the free-lunch GOP camp – <strong>CROWDING-OUT</strong>.  I only wished this document would have conceded the obvious fact that the sum of consumption and government purchases as shares of national income in 2005 was higher than it was in 2000.  </p>
<p>But let’s go back to page 5 for the ultimate bait and switch.  As it notes its assumption of a constant long-run debt to GDP ratio (I guess the authors have not noticed the increase in this ratio since George W. Bush took office), it talks about maintaining the tax rates projected for 2011 to 2016 under current law.  Excuse me – but current law has most of the Bush tax cuts expiring by 2010.  So, the document assumes we return to Clinton style tax policy.  And then it says making the Bush tax cuts permanent is pro-growth without telling us where we will get all those massive reductions in government spending in the future?  </p>
<p>David says this is a teachable moment.  He’s right.  We should teach our students to read such documents very carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/07/macroblog_an_un.html">Brad</a> replies to David:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s possible that there are huge spending cuts relative to GDP in our future. It&#8217;s not terribly likely. If I were Macroblog, I would say, instead, that the Bush tax cuts are good for growth because in response to the tax-cut magic the Growth Fairy will appear, wave her wand, and instantaneously boost labor productivity by 5%. That seems more likely than Macroblog&#8217;s scenario. There is a serious issue here: When one does policy evaluation of the proposals of an administration, does one evaluate the effects of the policies that the administration has proposed? Or does one evaluate the effects of the policies that the administration has proposed plus policies that the administration has not proposed, shows no inclination to propose, but that one wishes it would propose?</p></blockquote>
<p>Didn’t we go through this a generation ago?  Pro-growth proponents of Reagan’s 1981 tax cut – you know, the one founded on “work, save and invest” – may have hoped that Congress would slash spending.  It did not happen with the result being that national savings fell.  What makes anyone think this round will be any different?</p>
