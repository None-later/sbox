<blockquote><em>Income Inequality and Leisure Inequality: Do the 1% Work Harder Than the 99%?</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Wall Street Journal Wealth Report, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2012/04/27/do-the-wealthy-work-harder-than-the-rest/?mod=WSJBlog">Do the Wealthy Work Harder Than the Rest?</a>, by Robert Frank:</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><em>A new study [below] offers evidence that higher-educated (and therefore higher-earning)  Americans do indeed spend more time working and less time on leisure than poorer income groups. In fact, while income inequality may be growing, “leisure inequality” – time spent on enjoyment – is growing as a mirror image, with the low earners gaining leisure and the high earners losing.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em><br /></em><br />
<blockquote><em>The more surprising discovery, however, is a corresponding leisure gap has opened up between the highly-educated and less-educated. Low-educated men saw their leisure hours grow to 39.1 hours in 2003-2007, from 36.6 hours in 1985. Highly-educated men saw their leisure hours shrink to 33.2 hours from 34.4 hours. &#8230; A similar pattern emerged for women. Low-educated women saw their leisure time grow to 35.2 hours a week from 35 hours. High-educated women saw their leisure time decrease to 30.3 hours from 32.2 hours. &#8230; (The study defines leisure as time spend watching TV, socializing, playing games, talking on the phone, reading personal email, enjoying entertainment and hobbies and other activities.) &#8230;</em></p></blockquote>

                                <div>(Reuters) &#8211; Invoking Pope Benedict, Republican Representative Paul Ryan defended his budget plan on Thursday at Georgetown University, where a group of the Jesuit institution&#8217;s faculty has accused him of misusing Catholic teachings to push cuts to programs that serve the poor.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;The overarching threat to our whole society today is the exploding federal debt,&#8221; Ryan said, speaking in a Gothic, oak-paneled auditorium on the Georgetown campus.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;The Holy Father, Pope Benedict, has charged that governments, communities, and individuals running up high debt levels are &#8216;living at the expense of future generations&#8217; and &#8216;living in untruth.'&#8221;

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The overarching threat to our whole society today is the exploding federal debt?  Well, maybe. But this is an argument against raising revenues by raising taxes on the wealthy?  Or, for that matter, on anyone?<br /> <br />What’s most angering is this deliberately disorienting, gimmicky refusal by these pols—Ryan and Romney, in particular—to acknowledge that raising revenue through taxes reduces the government’s budget deficit and debt; that lowered tax rates in the last 11 years have significantly increased budget deficits and the debt (and that that also happened in the 1980s); that budget deficits and the national debt decreased during the 1990s after tax rates were raised during the G.H.W. Bush administration; and that Ryan’s and Romney’s tax-reduction plans would, according to (apparently) all projections except their own, substantially increase the national debt. <br /> <br />It’s one thing to argue for a substantial reduction or elimination of the national debt, but quite another to pretend that raising tax revenues isn’t one possible way to help do that.  <br /> <br /><a name="more"></a>These people do make Ayn Rand philosophical arguments to support their policy proposals, but the claim that the pope “has charged that governments, communities, and individuals running up high debt levels are ‘living at the expense of future generations’ and ‘living in untruth,’” is a <i>non sequitur </i>to the question of <i>how</i> we reduce the national debt.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It appears, though, that this particular bait-and-switch—Ryan’s claim that the pope supports his budget proposals because the pope has expressed concern about high debt levels of governments, communities and individuals—is causing outright revulsion among both <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/paul-ryans-faith-based-lesson/2012/04/27/gIQAH76TlT_story.html">mainstream media pundits </a>and the general public once they hear about it.  The pope as Ryan’s budget guide?  Really?  Comments posted to an article about it yesterday on Slate, titled “<a href="http://slatest.slate.com/posts/2012/04/27/paul_ryan_cites_pope_benedict_to_defend_budget.html">Paul Ryan Cites Pope In Defense of Budget Plan</a>,” almost universally express disgust and dismay at Ryan’s claim.  The pope as Ryan’s budget guide?  </p>
</div>
<div>The beauty of Ryan’s statement is that it helpfully highlights that, Romney’s insistence to the contrary, this election is not about the present and future economy—will cutting taxes for the wealthy by 20% and eliminating the EPA and banking regulations really spur the economy and lower the national debt?—but instead <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/04/romneys-radical-theory-of-fairness.html">about the very structure and purpose ofgovernment itself</a>.  And because Ryan has now invoked the pope as supposed political supporter of Ryan’s budget, the <i>real</i> Republican intent will likely gain widespread attention.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Halleluiah.  And praise the pope. 
</p>

<p>Ayn Rand v. Thomas Aquinas in Paul Ryan&#8217;s Mind</p>
<p> <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2012/04/26/471730/paul-ryan-ayn-rand/">Think Progress</a> piece on Paul Ryan.   </p>
<p>Think Progress has a post noting that though Paul Ryan used to go around telling people he got into politics because of Ayn Rand, and he required all his aides to read Atlas Shrugged, now he tells the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/297023/ryan-shrugged-robert-costa">National Review</a>:   <br />
<blockquote><bold>“I reject her philosophy,” Ryan says firmly.</bold> “It’s an atheist philosophy. It reduces human interactions down to mere contracts and it is antithetical to my worldview. If somebody is going to try to paste a person’s view on epistemology to me, then give me Thomas Aquinas,” who believed that man needs divine help in the pursuit of knowledge. “Don’t give me Ayn Rand,” he says.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d be inclined to believe him if he started handing out copies of the Summa Theologica (in the original Latin, of course) to his aides and requiring them to read them as he did with Atlas Shrugs.  But seriously, Aquinas?  On the plus side, what he wrote is free today.  (Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Y20eKOudwM0C&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;dq=summa+theologica&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=3r2aT7yYDor06AG9hK2bDw&#038;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&#038;q=summa%20theologica&#038;f=false">Summa Theologica</a>, considered his greatest work, in English.)   I&#8217;ll be honest &#8211; I tried to stumble through the Summa Theologica in my youth, but with no success.  That said, I don&#8217;t I&#8217;d pay to hear Ryan explain Aquinas&#8217;s work (provided it was a truthful and honest explanation) and how he plans to implement it to the American public.     I&#8217;d especially love to hear him explain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3078.htm#1">this</a> to the banking community:   <br />
<blockquote>Consequently, just as it is a sin against justice, to take money, by tacit or express agreement, in return for lending money or anything else that is consumed by being used, so also is it a like sin, by tacit or express agreement to receive anything whose price can be measured by money. Yet there would be no sin in receiving something of the kind, not as exacting it, nor yet as though it were due on account of some agreement tacit or expressed, but as a gratuity: since, even before lending the money, one could accept a gratuity, nor is one in a worse condition through lending.  On the other hand it is lawful to exact compensation for a loan, in respect of such things as are not appreciated by a measure of money, for instance, benevolence, and love for the lender, and so forth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, if Bank of America did start making loans simply out of benevolence or to encourage love for the lender, perhaps they&#8217;d make a lot fewer loans of the type that later require the benevolence of the Treasury and the Fed to bail them out.     </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3066.htm">the Summa Theologica</a>  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Things which are of human right cannot derogate from natural right or Divine right. Now according to the natural order established by Divine Providence, inferior things are ordained for the purpose of succoring man&#8217;s needs by their means. Wherefore the division and appropriation of things which are based on human law, do not preclude the fact that man&#8217;s needs have to be remedied by means of these very things. Hence whatever certain people have in superabundance is due, by natural law, to the purpose of succoring the poor. For this reason Ambrose [Loc. cit., 2, Objection 3] says, and his words are embodied in the Decretals (Dist. xlvii, can. Sicut ii): &#8220;It is the hungry man&#8217;s bread that you withhold, the naked man&#8217;s cloak that you store away, the money that you bury in the earth is the price of the poor man&#8217;s ransom and freedom.&#8221;   Since, however, there are many who are in need, while it is impossible for all to be succored by means of the same thing, each one is entrusted with the stewardship of his own things, so that out of them he may come to the aid of those who are in need. Nevertheless, if the need be so manifest and urgent, that it is evident that the present need must be remedied by whatever means be at hand (for instance when a person is in some imminent danger, and there is no other possible remedy), then it is lawful for a man to succor his own need by means of another&#8217;s property, by taking it either openly or secretly: nor is this properly speaking theft or robbery.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like I said, I&#8217;d love to hear Ryan explain this stuff to the American public.  But somehow I don&#8217;t think this is what Ryan had in mind when he says &#8220;give me Thomas Aquinas.&#8221;  I&#8217;d be willing to bet he read less of Aquinas than I did.   Hat tips to both <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/a-is-not-a-it-seems/">Paul Krugman</a> and <a href="http://tbogg.firedoglake.com/2012/04/26/dreamy-paul-ryan-breaks-up-with-his-special-lady-now-available/">TBogg</a> (great minds think alike?).</p>

<p>  Health care thoughts: Cross-conflicting regulations health facility edition</p>
<p>     The most recent regulatory question I had trouble answering. The situation is as follows (the state will remain nameless):     </p>
<p><em>State nursing home inspectors</em>:  certain antibiotics cannot be administered for certain conditions without a three day lab culture being done first; if the nursing home administers certain antibiotics without the three day culture the facility, administrator and nurses are subject to citations and penalties.     </p>
<p><em>State physician licensing board</em>: physicians can order the administration of medications including antibiotics within the standards of practice, failure to do so may be considered malpractice     State nurse licensing board: a nurse is to follow the orders of a licensed physician (or PA or NP supervised by a licensed physician) unless the orders fall outside the standards of practice or treatment is contraindicated (medication conflict for example);  failure to do so may be subject to disciplinary proceedings     </p>
<p><em>State nursing home inspectors</em>: failure to follow physician orders makes the facility, administrator and nurses subject to citations and penalties, and possible referral to various licensing boards     Office of the Inspector General:  treatments which violate state or federal regulations (even unintentionally) may make the billing for such treatments an act of fraud.     </p>
<p>So, a physician orders an antibiotic for a patient to be started immediately, in violation of the three day rule…….. the correct answer  is?     </p>
<p>(We did get a solution, sorta, will share that later.)</p>

                                <p>Note:  This post originally appeared, in slightly different form, at the author&#8217;s personal blog, <a href="http://brooklyndiogenes.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/rationality-of-banks/">Diogenes of Brooklyn</a>.  It appears here with that blogger&#8217;s kind permission. </p>
<p>He does talk in the third person sometimes.</p>
<p>by <a href="http://brooklyndiogenes.wordpress.com/">Diogenes of Brooklyn</a></p>
<p>Like most Americans, Diogenes knows nothing of economics and finance. But quite a lot about the ways that banks work, or don&#8217;t work, has become public knowledge.  </p>
<p>Remember when we were taught that economics was about rational markets.  Milton Friedman, patron saint of Republican economists, used to say on TV that everything is rational.  Keynes thought markets were more or less rational, except when they went nuts, the government had to step in.  Mr. Romney still says it in public:  Just a little private enterprise competency in the White House and everything will be hunky-dory, or however they say that in the language of the Harvard Business School.  It will get to be as good as it was the lasts time we had a President with a Harvard MBA (irony alert).  </p>
<p>Nowadays there is not so much rationality.  Especially about the toxic assets. The whole economy is in pretty bad shape, but the colossal failure started with the Real Estate Bubble.  A little of it was about Fannie and Freddie and the very powerful and very evil Barney Frank, but over 80 per cent of the problem was The Banks and Wall Street and good old private capital.  Wall Street had access to billions and billions of dollars that were not usefully employed.  Most of the stock market  in the doldrums, and the owners of the biggest chuck of money, the Chinese Government, could not invest the money at home for fear of distorting their very productive but fragile economy.  That enormous pile of money was invested in MBS&#8217;s and CDO&#8217;s and all the rest.  And that money in the mortgage market allowed the most enormous bubble in USA real estate.  You know the stories, whole towns in California where nobody lives, and nobody will ever live. People who bought houses at inflated prices.  Standard and Poors said when they rated the derivatives, that Real Estate prices had always gone up, they could not go down.  A lot of people lost their jobs in the Great Republican Recession, and could not sell their houses at any amount, let alone an amount that would cover the mortgage, even if they had put up 20%. It was a mess, and it remains a mess. </p>
<p>For a while Diogenes was associated with a company who told the world they had $10 billion from overseas investors, and that these investors wanted to buy the toxic assets of US Banks, at 26 cents on the dollar.  </p>
<p>Seemed like a pretty straightforward assignment, just call some large  number of banks, talk to the people responsible for unloading the things, and arrange a deal.   Not one bank that wanted to do a deal.   For a while people said this was because we let them know the price in advance.   It really was no secret how they came to the price of 26%:  When Merrill Lynch had to unload a ton of these assets in order for Bank of America to take them over, the assets sold in a hurry at that price.  </p>
<p>It was not about price.  It turns out that all of the banks preferred to let the assets get picked up by FDIC for 16%, instead of selling them privately for 26%.   HSBC turned over the assets that my associates wanted to buy at 26 cents, and gave them them up to the government at a lower price, 16%. </p>
<p>Seemed pretty stupid to me.  And some of the banks lied to me.  The VP at IndyMac told Diogenes they were selling these assets (actual foreclosed houses) one by one at 90 cents on the dollar, and would  not entertain any bulk sales of any kind.  And that they were working the portfolio down at a rate that was acceptable to the regulators.  Turned out not to be true.  David Letterman should someday be as funny as the guy from IndyMac. </p>
<p>In order to actually make a deal with investors, someone at the bank would have to take responsibility for de-valuing assets, in writing.  That is, the bank officer would have to make a decision to sell assets that were on the books for a billion dollars, and make the bank lose 740 million dollars, before the sale could take place at 260 million.  That guy would immediately lose his job and he would never be able to work in the banking business again. Let it go to FDIC, nobody has to sign off on it. As we say here in Brooklyn, Poi-fict. </p>
<p>The whole banking fiasco was based on an interlocking network of stupid rules and irrational markets. It is no wonder that if failed in a spectacular way.  It&#8217;s a good thing the Republicans have decided to end the Dodd-Frank bill, and get Big Government out of the way of the bankers who really know how to operate the money markets.  The collapse of the world economy has been so much fun, that we really ought to give them another go at it (irony alert).</p>

<blockquote><p>
<blockquote>the House Republicans on the Financial Services Committee just voted to repeal &#8220;resolution authority.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s review the history. When the crisis hit, the government bailed out many financial firms &#8212; shadow banks as they are known. That&#8217;s not what it does when an ordinary bank fails. When ordinary banks fail, the government takes over the bank, puts the good assets in one pile, the bad assets in another, then repackages the good assets into a new bank that is sold back to the private sector as soon as possible.  </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>This has many advantages, including the ability to replace managers of failed firms instead of rewarding them with a bailout. So why wasn&#8217;t this approach adopted during the financial crisis? The Treasury argues that it did not have the legal authority to take over large shadow banks &#8212; these banks fell outside of the existing regulatory umbrella (there is dispute on this point, some people claim the government regulators could have twisted existing regulation to allow this, but government regulators insist otherwise). Thus, government regulators believed there were only two (bad) choices. Let too big to fail banks fail and suffer the economic consequences, or to bail them out, including bailing out the owners and managers who had led the banks to disaster. If it had resolution authority &#8212; the ability to step in take over when banks fail &#8212; the rewards to management could have been avoided, and taxpayers could have been better protected in other ways, but limits on legal authority gave regulators only two bad options. Do nothing, or bail the banks out. </p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Social Security Hurt by Republican Jobs Obstructionism</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) published its <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/data-bytes/social-security-bytes/recession-weak-economy-behind-revision-of-social-securitys-projected-shortfall-to-2033">commentary</a> on Monday&#8217;s release of the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2012/index.html">Social Security Trustees Report</a>, which found that the Social Security trust fund would be exhausted in 2033. CEPR rightly blames the recession for the deterioration of Social Security&#8217;s finances. <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/increase-in-uninsured-rate-shows-need.html">As I argued last September</a> with regard to falling health care coverage, the new results from the Trustees show the need for a jobs agenda.</p>
<p>In fact, in just four years, the estimated trust fund exhaustion date (intermediate assumption) has gotten eight years closer. It was 2041 in the <a href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov/pressoffice/pr/trustee08-pr.htm">2008 report</a>, 2037 in the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2009/index.html">2009 report</a>, 2037 in the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2010/index.html">2010 report</a>, and 2036 in the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2011/index.html">2011 report</a>. Jared Bernstein <a href="http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/moving-exhaustion/">charts these trends</a> going back to 1985:</p>

<p>The CEPR analysis highlights just how crucial jobs are to Social Security&#8217;s solvency:<br />
<blockquote>As workers have found themselves without jobs, Social Security has received fewer contributions. The 2007 Trustees&#8217; Report projected 169.0 million workers in 2011 earning $6.5 trillion in taxable earnings. Last year, there were only 157.7 million workers earning $5.5 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, there was a $1 trillion shortfall of income in 2011 alone compared to the pre-recession baseline. If this doesn&#8217;t highlight the need for much greater action on the jobs front, nothing does.<br />   <br />Yet what is the Republican response to this situation? At the federal level, there has been universal opposition to anything that might create more jobs as long as Obama is President. At the state and local level, as Paul Krugman points out, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/opinion/krugman-the-amnesia-candidate.html?_r=1">70% of the decline in public sector jobs</a> has come in Texas and in the states where Republicans took control of government in 2010.    </p>
<p>What we see from the Trustees Report is that as jobs and income decline, Social Security is directly harmed. And I&#8217;m starting to have the feeling that for the Republicans, this is a feature, not a bug.  crossposted with <a href="http://www.blogger.com/middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Middle Class Political Economist</a></p>

<p>Reform that &#8220;high&#8221; statutory corporate tax rate? Not necessary</p>
<p>I got an interesting item pushed to me from an online-MBA website blog where today&#8217;s item was on &#8220;<a href="http://www.onlinemba.com/blog/10-big-businesses-that-barely-pay-taxes/">10 Big Businesses That Barely Pay Taxes</a>&#8220;. It looks at companies like GE, duPont, Verizon, ExxonMobil, FedEx, Boeing, Google and others that aggressively maximize the offshoring of profits and the onshoring of deductions (like the &#8220;domestic manufacturing&#8221; reduction in the tax rate, the research deduction, etc.) in order to tap out on taxes at zero or awfully close thereto. </p>
<p>The companies tend to dislike such coverage of their very low tax rates of only slightly more than 0% when they are quite loudly (and hypocritically) protesting how uncompetitive the 35% statutory rate makes them. The site notes that most of the companies have claimed that they pay a higher rate than the one noted here&#8211;usually by counting their financial statement deferred taxes as though they were already paid. Deferred taxes, however, are just an accounting way of noting the possibility of future taxes&#8211;they may never be paid (for example, if offshore profits are not repatriated, or if corporations are successful in lobbying for another very-low-tax repatriation holiday), and years of deferral can convert what appear to be substantial taxes into de minimis amounts, since that money is meanwhile invested and earning more money. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Here are some excerpts (not in the same order as in the blogpost itself):</p>
<blockquote><p>1.<strong>Boeing</strong> may own and operate factories and research facilities all over the U.S., but the mega-corporation isn’t paying much back to the government for the privilege of doing business in this country. In fact, the company hasn’t paid anything at all for three years running. Over those three years, Boeing made $9 billion in profits but didn’t pay anything in federal income taxes, actually getting back more than $178 million in tax benefits. &#8230;<br />2. &#8230; A study found that in 2008 <strong>FedEx</strong> paid no federal taxes, which the company claims is an anomaly caused by depreciation deductions. &#8230;<br />3. &#8230;<strong> Verizon </strong>hasn’t paid a cent in taxes for the past three years. &#8230;[i]t actually makes money from the government in the form of tax subsidies and is the third largest collector of these benefits in the U.S., &#8230; . Like GE, Verizon has denied these tax evasion allegations, stating that they pay billions in taxes every year, but like GE, Verizon is counting deferred taxes in these calculations. &#8230;<br />4.<strong>GE </strong>has raked in more than $81 billion during the past decade, but little of that profit has been returned to the government in the form of taxes. While the corporate tax rate has held steady at 35%, GE has paid an average of just 2.3% of its income in taxes since 2002. And that’s just an average, some years the company didn’t pay taxes at all, getting off scot-free in 2002, 2008, 2009, and 2010 &#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p><tt><strong>SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY SIMPLIFIED</strong></tt><br /><tt><strong></strong><br />The Trustees Report came out again this week.</p>
<p>And all the newspeople told us again that we are doomed.  Doomed.   <br />"Social Security is running out of money!"</p>
<p>Except it isn't.</p>
<p>And all the Professional Defenders of Social Security rushed out to  <br />tell us, "We can save Social Security: just make the rich pay for it!"</p>
<p>Except they won't.</p>
<p>And they really shouldn't.  And we shouldn't want them to.  Most  <br />workers understand that Their Social Security is Their money.  They  <br />paid for it.  They need to know that IT'S NOT WELFARE.</p>
<p>But all the paid experts and politicians, and all the high end  <br />newssources can only think in terms of welfare.  So the Bad Cop says  <br />we got to cut it.  And the Good Cop says we got to make the rich pay  <br />for it.</p>
<p>But actually all we really need to do is just pay for it ourselves...  <br />as we always have.</p>
<p>It wont cost much.  An additional 40 cents per week each year will  <br />pay for the whole "shortfall."</p>
<p>You don't have to take my word for it.  The Congressional Budget  <br />Office says the same thing.  A CBO Study:  <em><strong>Social Security Policy  <br />Options, July 2010</strong></em>,  Option <strong>2</strong> (page 17) says "Increase the Payroll  <br />Tax Rate by 2 Percentage Points Over 20 years... this option would  <br />raise the combined payroll tax rate gradually, by 0.1 percentage  <br />point (0.05 percentage points each for employers and employees) every  <br />year from 2012 to 2031... This option would extend the trust fund  <br />exhaustion date to 2083."</tt><br /><tt></tt><br /><tt></tt><br /><tt><a name="more"></a><br />Please note that while the tax would be increasing at one tenth of  <br />one percent per year... combined... wages would be increasing over  <br />one full percent per year.  So in today's terms the tax for the  <br />employee would increase by 40 cents per week (and another 40 cents  <br />for the employer), while wages are going up eight dollars per week  <br />each year.</p>
<p>CBO Option 3 would Increase the Payroll Tax Rate by 3 Percentage  <br />Points Over 60 years.  This would be a twenty cents per week increase  <br />in the tax each year for the employee and the employer.</p>
<p>With both of these Options it is likely that a similar increase would  <br />need to be enacted at the end of the twenty, or sixty, year period.  <br />This is unlikely to be a problem after people have seen that a  <br />gradual increase is not a "burden."  In fact it is unlikely they will  <br />even notice it.  Nor will the increases continue forever.  The  <br />Trustees Projection is that the need for increases will flatten and  <br />fall to essentially zero after life expectancies stabilize between  <br />2050 and 2070 or so.</p>
<p>Remember it is not a tax going into a government black hole.  It is  <br />You saving your own money, protected by "pay as you go with wage  <br />indexing,"  so that if all else fails you can retire when you need  <br />to.  You get your money back with interest in an annuity that will  <br />last the rest of your life. No matter what.</p>
<p>Now here is the hard part for you.</p>
<p>You need to think about this and make sure you understand it.  Then I  <br />am going to ask you to sign a petition.  Yes, I hate petitions too.   <br />But it's the only way I can think of to spread the word to the people  <br />that they can save their own Social Security for pennies per week.   <br />And not have to turn it into welfare by "raising the cap,"  or make  <br />it worthless as retirement insurance by cutting benefits, means  <br />testing, or raising the retirement age.</p>
<p>The petition calls for enactment of CBO Option 2 or 3.  It is not so  <br />important exactly which of these is enacted, or some variation.  What  <br />is important is that people learn how cheap it would be for them to  <br />save their own Social Security.  They won't learn it from the media,  <br />the politicians, or the experts.</p>
<p>Please visit    <a href="http://signon.org/sign/fix-social-security-with">http://signon.org/sign/fix-social-security-with</a>? <br />source=s.em.cp&r_by=4120788  and sign the petition.  Then, and I know  <br />this is an imposition,  ask your friends to read this and talk about  <br />it, and sign the petition.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br /></tt></p>
