<div>&#8212; Mitt Romney, yesterday
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sooo, Governor, about those <i>massive</i> tax cuts for the wealthy ….  You know, including the elimination of all incomes taxes on capital gains and stock dividends, which your running mate’s budget proposal includes?  <i>How</i>, exactly, do you plan to balance the budget despite that loss of revenue?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>No, no, no.  I mean, how, <i>exactly</i>, do you plan to do that?

                                <p>I associate the phrase &#8220;unconventional monetary policy&#8221; with Joe Gagnon.  Here we were in 2008 with the conventional monetary instrument &#8212; the target Federal Funds rate &#8212; pedal to the metal and the economy stalling.   Many people said it was time for fiscal stimulus (I think Gagnon agreed).  He also suggested unconventional monetary policy, by which he really meant unconventional policy by the Fed, since the point wasn&#8217;t changing the money supply but rather changing demand for other assets.  The Fed can create Fed liabilities (high powered money) and buy some assets driving up their prices.  To Gagnon the point was the assets side of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet.  His proposal was to buy a whole whole lot ($5 trillion worth).  That isn&#8217;t going to happen, so his new proposal is to buy assets which the Fed can buy which are perceived to be risky and are not close substitutes for money, that is Federal Agency issued mortgage bonds.</p>
<p>Oddly he is, as far as I can tell, the only advocate of unconventional monetary policy who focuses on which assets the Fed should buy (I don&#8217;t count myself and Brad DeLong occasionally sounds like Gagnon).  Some other economists (I am thinking of Duncan Black) propose that the Fed ignore the Federal Reserve act and do things which it is clearly not allowed to do.  Many more discuss unconventional monetary policy exactly as if it were conventional monetary policy.  </p>
<p>Why ?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I will explain then much later provide evidence.  It is agreed by all salt water economists that the Fed can normally stimulate demand in the short run by causing a price level higher than the one expected with sticky wages and prices were set.  For decades the key issue in the debate has been the problem of subgame non perfection which was renamed dynamic inconsistency (forcing those of us interested in dynamic inconsistency to call it time inconsistency so then they decided to call subgame non perfection time inconsistency).  The problem is that if price and wages setters know the monetary authority will try to cause a price level higher than the expected one, then the only subgame perfect equilibrium has socially costly inflation.  So the discussion became all about pre-commitment and credibility and expectations and such.  This always under the assumption that the Fed can get the price level it wants.</p>
<p>None of this has much to do with the current problem.  Ben Bernanke has been saying he wants higher demand for years now.  He&#8217;s practically been begging Congress for help.  In 2010 and 2011, the FOMC made huge mega gigantic efforts to stimulate the economy and nothing much happened.  Yet most salt water economists insist the the problem is that the FOMC has not decided to stimulate or has not communicated that intention.  </p>
<p>Some people are extreme and discuss the problem under the assumption that there is no difference between monetary policy with a Federal Funds rate of essentially zero and one with a rate of 10%.  They are very silly people and will not be named here.</p>
<p>Others are listed (with endorsement) by Brad DeLong (see above as the only semin Gagnonian I can think of) <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/08/a-half-written-platonic-dialogue-on-what-the-federal-reserve-is-doing-or-not-doing-right-now.html#comment-6a00e551f080038834017617446c6e970c">here</a> </p>
<p> Jan Hatzius&#8217;s proposals that the Fed buy $50 billion of long-term bonds a week until expectations of prices and of nominal spending return to their pre-2008 growth path. They are the ones who ought to be adopting Christina Romer&#8217;s proposals for price-level targeting. They are the ones who ought to be adopting Olivier Blanchard&#8217;s proposals for a long-run inflation target of 3+%/year rather than 2-%/year. They are the ones who ought to be adopting Joe Gagnon&#8217;s proposals for&#8211;since the FHFA won&#8217;t do its job and rebalance housing finance&#8211;the Federal Reserve to fund vehicles to deal with the underwater-borrower problems that beset our mortgage and housing markets and are holding back recovery.</p>
<p>(the odd grammar is because he is saying that Bernanke et al should be adopting these proposals).</p>
<p>Which one here is not like the others ?  Which one has a plan which will work even if it doesn&#8217;t affect the expectations of most economic agents ?  Which plan works through supply and demand and the assumption that if some things (RMBS) have higher prices then people will produce more of them ?  </p>
<p>I think the reason that Gagnon proposes a direct approach which does not work through the credibility of targeted expectational shifts of policy regimes is that he isn&#8217;t pathetically addicted to the decades of research which happen not to be very relevant at the moment.</p>
<p>The reliance of the others on the expected inflation imp (first cousin of the confidence fairy) is not due to the fact that only that imp can save us now.  It is just because they have been its votaries for too long to see that static supply and demand curves can tell us what the Fed needs to know now.</p>

<p>Romney&#8217;s Private Equity Magic Trick&#8211;equity manager&#8217;s gain, taxpayers&#8217; losses (Reich Video)</p>
<p>Mitt Romney claims that his business experience at Bain Capital is a superb qualification for the presidency.  He implies that this experience will carry over to his economic policies, with the suggestion that he will become a &#8220;job creator-in-chief&#8221; like all those one-percenters purportedly are in the private sector.<br />In reality, private equity experience is a recipe for disaster in the White House.  Think about what private equity firms do.  They take an ongoing business&#8211;usually one that is making decent profits and paying its workers decently&#8211;and they make it into one that can pay outsized &#8220;rent&#8221; profits to the private equity firm.  Usually, though not always, this means cutting costs and adding debt. </p>
<p>The debt is an elixir for private equity firms.  Because interest is deductible, it actually increases profits by lowering the company&#8217;s federal income taxes; yet because it isn&#8217;t required to be used by the firm to actually improve the products or services offered, it is often used instead to pay dividends to the private equity firms, paying off whatever actual investment the private equity firm made in the company. </p>
<p>Cutting costs is the way for private equity firms to extract even more gravy from their target company.  Cost cutting is most often directed at</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>firing workers and making fewer workers do the same work that more workers used to do (that&#8217;s called a &#8220;productivity&#8221; gain, garnered, of course, by the private equity firm and not by the everyday workers), and/or </li>
<li>outsourcing jobs to other countries so that labor can be paid less than a going wage in this country (that&#8217;s often coupled with step one, since workers are no longer needed in this country&#8211;sometimes the US workers are even required to train their cheaper foreign counterparts before they are let go, and of course those &#8220;effiencicy&#8221; gains are garnered by the private equity firm and not by the remaining workers), and/or </li>
<li>cutting wages and benefits for the remaining workers (and shipping those extra &#8220;savings&#8221; out as dividends to the equity firm investors), and/or </li>
<li>innovating better administrative systems (this can be a good deal&#8211;for example, putting money  that the company didn&#8217;t have until the new &#8220;investors&#8221; came in into digital record systems or improved communications systems, but it can also be a bad deal, if the firm uses its new technology to game the federal system on taxes, or Medicare reimbursements, or federal contracting or similar items)
<ul>
<li>Consider the fact that Bain and other private equity firms purchased a for-profit hospital.  One of the &#8220;improvements was to redesign the coding system for patient services to increase the reimbursements from Medicare and thus hike up the hospital system&#8217;s profits, which are garnered by the private equity firm.  Julie Creswell and Reed Adelson, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/business/hca-giant-hospital-chain-creates-a-windfall-for-private-equity.html">A Giant Hospital Chain is Blazing a Profit Trail</a>, New York Times (Aug. 15, 2012), at A1 (noting that Medicare reimbursements for the highest classifications surged to $949,000 in 2010 from $48,000 in 2006 at one hospital, in a story about Bain Capital and other equity firms&#8217;  profit improvements at HCA, where nurses and doctors express concerns about profit-making that is driving decisions that shortchange patients through understaffing and/or shortchange the government, as in the new coding system that caused the Medicare reimbursements to skyrocket); see also Steve Denning,<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2012/08/15/private-equity-wont-fix-health-care-either/">HCA: The unsustainable private equity bubble in US health care</a>, Forbes (Aug. 15, 2012). </li>
<li>As one commenter on the NY Times article noted, &#8220;To be more profitable as a healthcare facility requires &#8230; having more sick people to treat, or hav[ing] higher charges.  Both are inhumane.&#8221;  Munz, New York, NY.  And as one former HCA employee commented, &#8220;patient safety and medication safety came in a distant 2nd to conformity and [the] draconian measures to make care more efficient.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These kinds of activities go hand in hand with the increasing consolidation into mega-business enterprises (regrettably aided by the tax code&#8217;s &#8220;tax-free reorganization&#8221; provisions, that were also made much more flexible during the Bush years in order to facilitate such consolidations).  Big businesses reap the productivity gains of their workers for the few managers and significant shareholders at the top, and either buy  or compete with local and family-owned small enterprises to put those smaller and shallower-pocketed (and less well-connected) business out of the way, thus separating more and more businesses from the communities in which they are located.  All in all, not good for America, and not the kind of skills one wants in the presidency, where we need someone who can see the relationship between the stability of small businesses, viable communities, and stable workers.</p>

<div>A new Romney ad tells older voters to think of it this way: “The money <em>you</em> paid for your guaranteed health care is going to a massive new government program <em>that’s not for you.</em>”
</p>
</div>
<div>&#8212; Gail Collins, <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/opinion/collins-middle-age-blues.html">Middle-Age Blues</a></i>, New York Times, this evening
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><i>What?</i>  If current Medicare recipients, and those who will begin receiving it within the next 10 years, have already <i>paid</i> for Medicare for themselves, then—um—why does Medicare have to be saved by these two Republican saviors who will convert the system into a partial-premium-voucher system?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Oh. Wait. That very same budget plan that includes that Medicare proposal also includes a proposal to end income taxes on capital gains and on stock dividends and to reduce corporate income taxes—leaving a budget deficit of trillions of dollars.  And, well, the money for that defense-budget increase that these folks also propose has to come from <i>somewhere</i>, doesn’t it?  Other than just from the elimination of Medicaid expenditures for nursing home care for the elderly who’ve run out of savings during their nursing home stay, that is, since that alone won’t cover that huge revenue reduction, and anyway it’s good policy to force those nursing home residents to become self-reliant again.  I understand that we’re making progress in finding drugs to cure Alzheimer’s disease, but, still.  And anyway, unless a cure is found before the fiscal 2013 budget kicks in, there will be no federal money to fund continued research on it. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So that leaves as the only option saving Medicare by destroying it.  No matter that the money that those under-55 youngsters paid for <i>their</i>guaranteed healthcare will be going to a massive new program <i>that’s not for them</i>.  Well, okay, a program that’s for a few of them.  The ones who are living mainly off of capital gains and stock dividends.  A <i>very</i> few, I suspect.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212;-
</p>
</div>
<div>The entire Gail Collins column is absolutely priceless—a definite must-read.

<div>Ann Romney said in an interview airing Wednesday that her husband has no plans to release additional tax returns, saying “it’ll just give them more ammunition” and insisting that “there’s nothing we’re hiding.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“We have been very transparent to what’s legally required of us. But the more we release, the more we get attacked, the more we get questioned, the more we get pushed. And so we have done what’s legally required and there’s going to be no more, there’s going to be no more tax releases given,” she said in the interview by NBC News. “And there’s a reason for that, and that’s because of how, what happens as soon as we release anything.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney is releasing two years of his tax returns. Democrats have said what’s he hiding and demanded he make public the last 10 years or more.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ann Romney also defended Romney’s character and said the “only reason we don’t disclose more is we’ll just become a bigger target.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Mitt’s financial disclosures when he was governor are huge if people want to really look and see any question they have,” she said. “The other thing they have to understand is that Mitt is as honest — his integrity is just golden. We pay our taxes, we are absolutely — beyond paying our taxes we also give 10 percent of our income to charity.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>She also said that the couple has had a blind trust since 2002 before Romney was governor and that they don’t know what’s in it.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“There’s nothing we’re hiding,” she said, later adding: “I’ll be curious to see what’s in there too.”
</p>

<div>            &#8212; <i><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79757.html?hp=l5">Ann Romney: No more tax returns</a></i>, Tomer Ovadia, Politico, today
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>An article published recently by James B. Stewart in the New York Times titled <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/11/business/in-the-superrich-clues-to-romneys-tax-returns-common-sense.html?pagewanted=all">In Superrich, Clues to What Might Be in Romney’s Returns</a></i>, overlooked because it was published on Saturday, the day on which Romney made his Ryan announcement, explains that 2008 and 2009 were banner tax-break years for a large number of very wealthy people whose main or entire source of income comes from stock dividends and the sale of securities. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The occasion for the article was the IRS’s release last week of “data from the 400 individual income tax returns reporting the highest adjusted gross income, writes Stewart. “This elite ultrarich group,” he says, “earned on average $202 million in 2009, the latest year available.  And buried in the data is the startling disclosure that six of the 400 paid no federal income tax.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which suggestions the likelihood that the Romneys paid no, or almost no, income taxes for 2008 and 2009. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It does not take a math genius or a tax expert to recognize this.  That’s good, because I am neither.  But I am good enough in math (if barely) to know that 2006, the last year of Romney’s term as governor, ended before 2008 began. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And, thanks to the Romney tax-returns controversy, I know that in 2009 the Department of Justice entered into an agreement with UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, and other Swiss banks, in which the banks agreed to disclose to the U.S. government the identities of American holders of Swiss bank accounts, and that approximately 34,000 Americans took advantage of an amnesty program that the IRS and Justice Department offered, by which voluntary payment of back taxes and interest and penalties would remove criminal liability and public disclosure. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And I have followed the Romney tax story closely enough during the last few months to know that the Romneys’ 2010 tax returns revealed a bank account with UBS, apparently opened in 2003, was closed sometime during that year and had $3 million in it when it was closed.  And that, according to news reports, Romney did not disclose this account on his Massachusetts financial-disclosure forms—although, unless my math ability (such as it is) fails me, 2003 ended before early 2007, when Romney’s term as governor ended. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And that, also according to news reports, the 2010 returns show that the Romneys have a shell corporation in the tax haven of Bermuda into which they apparently were funneling income from overseas Bain investments, and that one day before Romney was sworn in as governor, the corporation’s shares were transferred to Ann Romney, and the corporation was not disclosed on Romney’s Massachusetts financial-disclosure forms.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So, yes, Ann, you’re hiding something.  You’re hiding whatever it is that would give your opponent ammunition, whatever it is that would make your husband a bigger target.  And that ammunition is that, whether or not you and he failed to disclose that Swiss account and any other Swiss accounts you held that were closed before 2010 until a gun was held to your heads in 2009, you and he employed tax loopholes and special tax rates that your husband and (even more so) his running mate plan to expand so as to eliminate the very need for offshore tax shelters.  They plan to make this country an overt tax shelter for the wealthy and, especially, for the <i>very</i> wealthy—that is, for people like you and your husband. They have made that central to their policy plans, while desperately trying to deflect scrutiny of those proposals. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stewart writes in his article, “Tax experts I consulted said these results almost certainly reflected aggressive use of tax-loss carry-forwards from 2008, since the stock market bottomed in March 2009 and rallied strongly during the rest of the year.”  Expressly under Paul Ryan’s plan, there will be no income tax at all on capital gains and on dividends.  <i>Every</i> year will be 2008 and 2009 for the Romneys!  Except, of course, for the need for aggressive use of tax-loss carry-forwards, and the like; no more need for that sort of thing.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>A lot of eyebrows were raised on Sunday when Ryan, sitting next to Romney in an interview, told Bob Schieffer that he wants to end the tax breaks that apply only to the wealthy.  That’s nice, but of no effect.  A seminal part of his tax-and-budget plan, passed this year by the House, is the elimination of <i>all</i> income taxes on capital gains and dividends.  And although this would mean that many very wealthy people will pay no income taxes or estate taxes, and many other very wealthy people would pay income taxes at a single-digit rate, the elimination of these taxes would apply as well to the non-wealthy who have a capital gain or receive stock dividends, however small.  And so—voila!—Ryan’s statement, made with such earnestness, does not apply to the issue of taxes on capital gains and dividends.  Nor, for that matter, to estate taxes, which his plan entirely eliminates; some non-wealthy people leave small estates, after all.  And semantics is the name of their game, the objective of which is the enabling of ever more vast accumulations of wealth, utterly unfettered by tax obligations.  Pure and simple.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>My big fear about the all-Medicare-all-the-time campaign that began last weekend with Romney’s Ryan announcement is that it allows Romney and Ryan to claim the mantle of straight talkers about what they warn is a Medicare-caused fiscal calamity that awaits.  They have yet to explain why, if they fear such a calamity, they propose to reduce federal revenue by trillions of dollars, through their tax-elimination-on-the-wealthy plan.  And when they stress, as they do again and again, that their destroy-Medicare-in-order-to-save-it plan will not end the current program for its current or relatively-imminent recipients (those who are 55 or older), maybe they’ll deign to reveal what programs will be eliminated in order to pay for Medicare for current recipients and baby boomers <i>and</i>—<i>and</i>—the trillions-of-dollars tax cuts for the wealthy.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>My suggestion: Hurricane disaster relief for the southern Atlantic and Gulf Coast states, which will vote for this ticket <i>en force</i>, and crop insurance and drought disaster relief for the plains states, which will vote for them and their budget plan in almost as large percentages. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In 2005, Ryan now-famously advised his audience when he addressed an Ayn Rand fan club that they should make no mistake: current politics is a clash between “individualism” and “collectivism.”  And indeed it is.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, let’s ensure that the public knows the specifics.

                                <p>by Rebecca Wilder</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-14082012-BP/EN/2-14082012-BP-EN.PDF">Eurostat flash estimate</a>, Euro area GDP fell by 0.2% in both the euro area and the EU27 in the second quarter of 2012. In the first quarter of 2012, growth rates were 0.0% in both zones. On balance, the Euro area is very likely in recession despite the fact that the region successfully skirted the “two negative quarters of growth” rule of recession dating having stagnated in Q1 2012 following a 0.3% contraction in Q4 2011.</p>
<p>The underlying country GDP estimates for Q2, released by the various statistical agencies, do illustrate a deep divide among the growth prospects across the 17-country Euro area in Q2 2012. Here is a select list of reported growth results (all for Q2 2012 in % Q/Q not annualized):</p>
<p>Germany, +0.3%<br />France , +0.0%<br />Netherlands, +0.2%<br />Spain, -0.4%<br />Italy, -0.7%<br />Portugal, -1.2%</p>
<p>The French flash release, in particular, caught my eye: “No growth for the third consecutive quarter” is what <a href="http://www.insee.fr/en/themes/info-rapide.asp?id=26&#038;date=20120814">INSEE titled its publication</a>. The French economy has effectively stalled. Using Eurostat data, the economy has grown just 0.09% (the unrevised numbers) since July 2011. And since Q2 2011, the economy grew just 0.3%. In all, the economy is not technically in recession but it certainly isn’t expanding. To me, the question is, will it go up or down from here?</p>
<p>Compared to history, the current expansion in France has been nothing short of pathetic. Stuck in the mud.</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wR26sdXZxmw/UCunoJtR27I/AAAAAAAAA90/QR_u3X15YE4/s1600/europe.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="231" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wR26sdXZxmw/UCunoJtR27I/AAAAAAAAA90/QR_u3X15YE4/s320/europe.png"></a></div>
<p><em>Note: In the chart above, the French dating of business cycles is taken from the OECD, which is available through the FRED database. In the legend, those dates with a (2) indicate short recoveries with an ensuing recession (1 recession and 1 expansion with the same number of quarters as the 2009-2012 expansion).

<p> Romryanomics&#8211;prosperity for the well-off fueled by austerity for the rest</p>
<p> I&#8217;ve put off writing about stilted robo-Romney&#8217;s choice of the perpetual-smily-Ryan as veep about as long as I can, I suppose.  So let me talk about it in broad terms in this post.  In the next posts, I&#8217;ll discuss more methodically the vacuous &#8220;Romney program&#8221; and the toxic &#8220;Ryan path to prosperity&#8221; with particular attention to what they have said specifically (or not, in Romney&#8217;s case) about what they want to do with the tax system. </p>
<p>Both Romney and Ryan come from well-to-do families with the privileges of financial support, status and connections that adhere thereto (see <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/20/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-he-didnt-inherit-money-his-parent/">this story</a> on Romney&#8211;by the way, a donated inheritance is still an inheritance and donations of that magnitude earn other privileges for the elite; and <a href="http://blogs.detroitnews.com/politics/2012/08/14/ryans-family-fortune-built-on-taxpayer-money/">this story </a>on Ryan&#8211;whose wife also inherited millions including oil and gas interests), yet support the neoconservative economic mythology that wealth is wholly based on merit and that the way to have a good economy is to make sure the wealthy, who are deemed to be the (mythic) &#8220;job creators&#8221; are happy.  This leads them to support austerity for the middle class and seniors coupled with deregulation, privatization, militarization and tax cuts&#8211;Romryanomics 101. </p>
<p>Key to the Romney program (or what can be derived from a description of generalities-without-specifics that can&#8217;t be scored by economists plus Romney&#8217;s statement earlier that he would sign Ryan&#8217;s budget proposal into law if passed by Congress plus his Monday statement that &#8220;his own plan for Medicare is &#8216;very similar&#8217; to Ryan&#8217;s&#8221;, per this <a href="http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/14/13282003-romney-draws-on-2010-playbook-in-medicare-offensive?lite">NBCnews.com story </a>) and the Ryan so-called &#8220;path to prosperity&#8221; (see, e.g., the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hiltzik-20120815,0,1949780.column">LA Times story</a>) is privatization of, and spending cuts to, Social Security and Medicare, along with spending cuts to everything else that serves the public good (environmental programs, parks, etc.) and vulnerable minorities in this country and isn&#8217;t part of the military-industrial-financial complex.  That is, social welfare programs that have made the difference between poverty and dignity for American seniors will be undone by some level of privatization and benefit cuts, to accomodate unmerited tax cuts for the wealthy and increased spending on the military (notice the echos of Bush&#8217;s Iraq-war buildup in the talk about being tough on Iran and extraordinarily friendly to Israel coming from the campaign). </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Of course, this program of tax cuts, militarization, and deregulation has already been tried&#8211;those are the ideas that failed to deliver a robust economy under George W. Bush, who had an anemic recovery from 2001-2004 in spite of the $1.3 trillion in tax cuts over ten years enacted in 2001 and the continuing tax cuts carried out in 2003 and 2004.  Nor did Bush&#8217;s imperialistic militarization through two preemptive wars deliver a robust economy.  Instead, the rash of financial speculation and finanialization of the economy pushed us into a deep financial crisis and the Great Recession.  Those ideas will upend the recovery from that recession that has been underway under Obama.</p>
<p>Both Romney and Ryan have personally benefited from the kind of government that recognizes the importance of public-private cooperation in institution and infrastructure building, yet pontificate that government is always less efficient than private enterprise.  That rhetoric is used to justify stifling innovative programs like supporting experiments in environmentally sound energy development, but it doesn&#8217;t come into play as far as continuing to ladle out tax-code largesse to the profitable oil and gas extractive industry or coddling financial institutions through deregulation (Romney, for example, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-14/romney-vowing-dodd-frank-repeal-hits-jpmorgan-inconvenient-truth.html">supports dismantling Dodd-Frank</a>, an already timid effort to rein in financial speculation; Ryan <a href="http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/paul-ryan-really-doesnt-dodd-frank">voted for TARP and against Dodd-Frank</a>, positions that garnered Republicans a haul of financial industry contributions).  That approach will continue the George W. Bush trend of the financialization of the economy and likely land us in another, even worse, systemic financial crisis. </p>
<p>Both had ancestors that benefited greatly (in terms of prestige and in terms of economics) from their involvement in and with government.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Romney">Romney&#8217;s father George</a>, of course, was a well-known governor of Michigan &#8211;and  a wealthy corporate CEO in the auto industry that benefited hugely from the government shift from investment in railroads to investment in roads.  Ryan&#8217;s family reaped its riches at the public trough&#8211;involved in the kind of public-private partnerships that made the transcontinental railroads possible (and built enormous wealth for the railroad builders) and the interstate highway system possible (and built enormous wealth for the highway builders).  See Libby Spencer, Ryan <a href="http://blogs.detroitnews.com/politics/2012/08/14/ryans-family-fortune-built-on-taxpayer-money/">family fortune built on taxpayer money</a>, DetroitNews.com (Aug. 14, 2012);  Sally Kohn, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/08/14/paul_ryan_didnt_build_that/">Paul Ryan didn&#8217;t build that!</a>Salon.com (Aug. 14, 2012) (noting that  the Ryan family, starting with his great-grandfather building railroads, has profited from government contracts over more than a century, including &#8220;at least 22 defense contracts &#8230; since 1996&#8221;).<br />Romney likes to think of himself as a successful businessman who can lead the country by supporting business.</p>
<p>But Romney is mainly a vulture capitalist.  His private equity firm bought companies that were doing well and providing good US jobs, loaded them up with debt so that outsize profits could be made for the Bain &#8220;investors&#8221; (himself included), and &#8211;if it helped them make even more outsize profits&#8211;enjoyed firing the &#8220;excess&#8221; workers. Private equity firms don&#8217;t produce anything.  While the right applauds the so-called &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; that tears existing companies apart to sell off the pieces for more or to enable firing the workers and breaking a union contract, those activities don&#8217;t add to a sustainable economy.  They  mostly look for companies they can take over, with no regard for the workers&#8217; lives or the communities in which the companies exist, in order to capture what economists refer to as &#8220;rent&#8221; profits, usually through loading the companies up with debt.  Some of the companies thrive or just survive, but many of the workers don&#8217;t, since cutting workers is a favored cost-cutting measure.  Some of the companies go bankrupt, leaving all the workers in the lurch and usually without promised pensions.  Some of the companies turn to outsourcing workers in order to make enough to pay off the debt.  There&#8217;s not much in vulture capitalism that bodes well for a vulture capitalist as president.</p>
<p>Ryan likes to think of himself as a principled thinker who will push for what he considers appropriate policies (no matter, apparently, their impact on vulnerable seniors or middle-class Americans).  As Ryan&#8217;s 2005 speech to <a href="http://www.atlassociety.org/outline-john-galts-speech">the Atlas Society</a>made clear, he has been an avid follower of Ayn Rand, the alpha-male praising, privileged-innovator(&#8220;producers&#8221;)-elite loving, anti-societal cooperation, anti-altruism,  radical libertarian, free-trade &#8220;objectivist&#8221; author that has been called the &#8220;Goddess of the Market&#8221; (see Jennifer Burns, Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right).  Ryan even told the Weekly Standard in 2003 that  “I give out ‘<em>Atlas Shrugged’</em> as Christmas presents, and I make all my interns read it,” he said. “Well&#8230; I try to make my interns read it.” Rachel Weiner, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/what-ayn-rand-says-about-paul-ryan/2012/08/13/fd40d574-e56d-11e1-8741-940e3f6dbf48_blog.html">What Ayn Rand says about Paul Ryan</a>, Washington Post (Aug. 13, 2012).  Lately, though, he&#8217;s been trying to distance himself from Rand, perhaps because he finally learned that her brand of radical libertarianism derived from atheism rather than theism.  Kate Sullivan, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/pageviews/2012/08/veep-nominee-paul-ryan-renounces-former-fascination-with-ayn-rand">Veep nominee Paul Ryan renounces former fascination with Ayn Rand</a>, NY Daily News (Aug. 14, 2012).</p>

                                <p>
<div></div>
<div>During the Great Recession, when many hospitals across the country were nearly brought to their knees by growing numbers of uninsured patients, one hospital system not only survived — it thrived.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">In fact, profits at the health care industry giant <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/hca-holdings-inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More information about HCA Holdings Inc">HCA</a>, which controls 163 hospitals from New Hampshire to California, <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=63489&#038;p=irol-newsArticle&#038;ID=1722510&#038;highlight=" title="Latest earnings statement. ">have soared</a>, far outpacing those of most of its competitors.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The big winners have been three <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/private_equity/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about private equity.">private equity</a> firms — including Bain Capital, co-founded by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate — that bought HCA in late 2006.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">HCA’s robust profit growth has raised the value of the firms’ holdings to nearly three and a half times their initial investment in the $33 billion deal. The financial performance has been so impressive that HCA has become a model for the industry. Its success inspired 35 buyouts of hospitals or chains of facilities in the last two and a half years by private equity firms eager to repeat that windfall.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">HCA’s emergence as a powerful leader in the hospital industry is all the more remarkable because only a decade ago the company was badly shaken by a wide-ranging <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicare/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival health news about Medicare.">Medicare</a> fraud investigation that it eventually settled for more than $1.7 billion.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">Among the secrets to HCA’s success: It figured out how to get more revenue from private insurance companies, patients and Medicare by billing much more aggressively for its services than ever before; it found ways to reduce emergency room overcrowding and expenses; and it experimented with ways to reduce the cost of medical staff, a move that sometimes led to conflicts with doctors and nurses over concerns about patient care.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">In late 2008, for instance, HCA changed the billing codes it assigned to sick and injured patients who came into the emergency rooms. Almost overnight, the numbers of patients who HCA said needed more care, which would be paid for at significantly higher levels by Medicare, surged.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">HCA, which had lagged the industry for those high-paying categories, jumped ahead of its competitors and was reimbursed accordingly. The change, which HCA’s executives said better reflected the service being provided, <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hca-reports-first-quarter-2009-results-61986062.html" title="The earnings statement.">increased operating earnings</a> by nearly $100 million in the first quarter of 2009.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">To some, HCA successfully pushed the envelope in its interpretation of existing Medicare rules. “If HCA can do it, why can’t we?” asked a hospital consulting firm, the Advisory Board Company, in a presentation to its clients.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">In one instance, HCA executives said a private insurer, which it declined to name, questioned the new billing system, forcing it to return some of the money it had collected.

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let me speculate here: Might Romney’s tax returns for the few years preceding 2010 show an interest in the Bain fund that continues to own a large share in HCA even though HCA went public last year?*  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Just asking.
</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*The New York Times article explains:
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the spring of 2011, in one of the most closely watched public offerings since the financial crisis, HCA became a public company once again. Its three buyout owners each sold another $500 million worth of stock, allowing them to recoup all their initial investment.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">Last fall, HCA agreed to buy back the stake held by Bank of America, which had purchased Merrill Lynch in 2009, for $1.5 billion, giving the bank a return of two and a half times its initial investment. And earlier this year, HCA paid out $900 million in dividends, of which $360 million went to K.K.R. and Bain.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">The 40 percent stake in HCA still held by K.K.R. and Bain is worth about $4.8 billion at current levels, giving them a potential profit, with the dividends they have received, of three and a half times their initial investment of $1.2 billion each.

<p>ID theft as basis of systemic IRS tax refund fraud problems</p>
<p>Early in 2012, the IRS and Justice Department announced a major crackdown on identity theft and enforcement efforts against tax refund fraud.  See IIRS, <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=253147,00.html?portlet=108">Identity Theft Crackdown Swweps Across the Nation: More than 200 Actions Taken in Past Week in 23 States</a>, IR-2012-13 (Jan 13, 2012).   However, the IRS, which hasn&#8217;t been a perennial favorite funding target of GOPers in Congress and has had to operate with too few staff and resources to do its job well, has continued to fail to keep up with the criminals who commit tax fraud.  A recent report by the Inspector General for Tax Administration suggests a range of problems. TIGTA, <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2012reports/201242080fr.pdf">There are Billions of Dollars in Undetected Tax REfund Fraud Resulting from Identity Theft</a> (July 19, 2012) (Ref. No. 2012-42-080). See also Richard Rubin, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-02/irs-may-lose-21-billion-in-identity-fraud-study-says.html">IRS may lose $21 billion in identity fraud, study says</a>, Bloomberg.com (Aug. 2, 2012).</p>
<p>The TIGTA report suggests that identity thieves may end up claiming as much as $21 billion in fraudulent tax refunds over the next five years. Examples include $3.3 million in refunds sent to a single address in MIchigan listed on more than 2000 different tax returns and more than 300 direct deposits totaling almost half a million sent in to a single bank account.  There was one bank account that received 590 deposits totally more than 909 thousand dollars. </p>

<p>The agency responded that it has changed its screening filters to address the issues raised and taken several steps to address tax-related identity fraud, which has been concentrated in Florida. The TIGTA report had a series of recommendations, including better use of third party information and limits on tax refunds being sent to the same bank account.</p>
<p>Bloomberg.com also reports a harsh assessment of the IRS&#8217;s effort to provide Tax Identification Numbers (TINs) to non-US residents.  See Richard Rubin, IRS <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/irs-allowed-fraud-in-rush-to-issue-id-numbers-audit-says.html">Allowed Fraud in Rust to Issue ID Numbers, Audit Says </a>(Aug. 8, 2012).  (For a similar audit report issued by the Deputy Inspector General for Audit on July 7, 2011, see<a href="http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2011reports/201141061fr.html">here</a>.) The rush to serve resulted in allowing fraud to go undetected, with examples of almost 16,000 TINs going to a single address in Phoenix and $52.5 million in refunds for nonresident TINs going to just four addresses in Atlanta. In 2011, the IRS processed almost 3 million tax returns from nonresidents and sent almost $7 billion in tax refunds in response.  But their rush to provide numbers and process returns meant they made mistakes, apparently with some supervisors actually discouraging employees from taking the time to root out fraud, according to the IRS inspector general.  The IRS has announced that it is reinforcing its procedures to ensure the integrity of the program, including a requirement that original identification documents be submitted with applications for TINs.</p>
