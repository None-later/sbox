<p>Time to pile on regarding the 300 economists for the McCain economic plan.  I thought it was pretty funny that Douglas Holtz-Eakin signed on &#8212; &#8216;look, boss, I approve of my own plan!&#8217; &#8212; and the presences of the likes of Phil Gramm, Kevin Hassett, and John R. Lott Jr. should be viewed as each constituting minus a large number of good economists, so the net number of signatories is close to zero.</p>
<p>The opportunity for confusion, as even <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/07/08/the-economic-policy-of-john-mccain?rss=true">Felix Salmon exhibits some</a>, is the presence of undeniably prominent economists on the list.  To help in evaluating the significance of there presence, here&#8217;s a prediction from quasi-Nobel laureate Gary Becker (signer of the McCain statement), current CEA chair Edward Lazear, and John Bates Clark medalist Kevin Murphy of the Chicago GSB (Lazear and Murphy did not sign):<br />
<blockquote>The evidence is clear: Cutting taxes will have beneficial effects. Tax cuts will keep government spending in check and will provide the incentives necessary to produce a highly skilled, productive work force that enables high economic growth and rising standards of living.</p></blockquote>
<p>That was from &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB106548881712135300-search.html?collection=wsjie%252F30day&#038;vql_string=becker%253Cin%253E%2528article%252Dbody%2529">The Double Benefits of Tax Cuts</a>,&#8221; published on the W$J op-ed page on October 7, 2003.  Goes to show that the line between being a real economist and a &#8220;policy entrepreneur&#8221; is a fine one. For some indications of how that has worked out, see e.g. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">here</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-fiscal.html">here</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-personal-income.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/comparing-presidents-average-real.html">here</a> from the AB archives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, leave it to the <a href="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/2008/07/in-brief-john-mccain-hateshearts.html">Rude Pundit</a> to get right to the fundamental contradiction of the list (a very extended, and actually non-rude, excerpt is required):<br />
<blockquote>So John McCain proposes a gas tax holiday and economists almost universally say it&#8217;s a stupid idea. In June, McCain, being a reasonable man, chooses to mock the economists: &#8220;If you want to call it a gimmick, fine. You know the economists? They’re the same ones that didn’t predict this housing crisis we’re now in.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Now McCain has put forth a great and mighty economic plan. Did it yesterday, less than a month after dissing the poindexters. And his campaign has released a letter from, well, who else? Economists who support it. Oodles of them. Guess they know a lot about economics, eh?</p>
<p>&#8230;[T]he Rude Pundit chose one of the names at relatively random. University of Chicago&#8217;s Gary Becker, who does a blog on, you know, economics&#8230; [B]ack in December 2007, Becker says, &#8220;The vast majority of economists, including me, were surprised by the extent of the subprime mortgage crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, to conclude: for John McCain, economists who didn&#8217;t predict the mortgage crisis don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about when it comes to a gas tax holiday, but when it comes to his entire economic plan, they&#8217;re a-ok. What fun.</p>
<p>Does that qualify as straight talk?</p></blockquote>

McCain claims the footwear called Croc was an American invention, its manufacturer employs lots of Americans, and provides us with a source of exports.  If that were all true, does McCain not understand that his promotion of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/mccains-energy-policy-and-export-led.html">dollar appreciation</a> could lead to lower export demand, which will in his own words be a barrier to our access to foreign markets and:</p>
<blockquote><p>have a devastating effect on our economy and jobs, and the prosperity of American families.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/07/08/john-mccain-what-a-croc">Nicole Belle</a> has been doing some fact checking and finds <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/blog-entry/mccains-croc-hooey">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crocs weren&#8217;t invented by &#8220;a couple of entreprenuers&#8221; in Colorado, let alone by Duke Hansen. They weren&#8217;t even invented in America. They were invented in that Great Frozen Socialist Paradise to the north. You read that right: Ugly neon-hued foam shoes are another diabolical innovation for which we can Blame Canada.  The company that invented them was subsequently bought by Hansen and two other aforementioned Colorado entrepreneurs, who added the cute name and the marketing gloss. But the shoes are still made abroad, in the original factory in Quebec, where the employees come pre-equipped with their own health insurance. Or at least, they will be for a few more weeks: in April, the company announced that they will close down the Quebec City plant in July, sending the 670 jobs there to plants in Mexico, Brazil, and beyond.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did someone say NAFTA?  But we are not done:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following a solid IPO in 2006 and a strong 2007, their sales have been off dramatically this year. The company&#8217;s published fundamentals look OK, but sell-through sucks, and their current stock price is down 82 percent from this time last year. In other words: it&#8217;s a Great American Business that&#8217;s showing signs of getting hammered in a Republican recession. Also, there are now at least three shareholder lawsuits in the offing. Evidently, some investors suspect that the owners knew more than they were telling when they dumped large quantities of their own stock late last year, just before it all went to hell. In other words: It&#8217;s a Great American Business that&#8217;s run by Republicans, who are evidently getting everything their generous donations to the GOP paid for: presidential puffery, scrupulously indifferent SEC oversight, low taxes— and a tanking economy that&#8217;s left fewer and fewer families in a position to pay $35 for a pair of kids&#8217; shoes.</p></blockquote>
<p>A “Great American Business”?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It always helps to check the SEC 10-K filings, which for Croc says in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2007, international sales accounted for approximately 48% of total revenues in 2007, compared to 32% in 2006 and 7% in 2005 &#8230; In the year ended December 31, 2007, we manufactured approximately 17% of our footwear products at our Company-operated manufacturing facilities in North America, Italy and Brazil. We obtained the remaining 83% of our footwear products from third-party manufacturers in China, Bosnia, Vietnam, Romania and the U.S. In the year ended December 31, 2007, our largest third-party supplier in China produced approximately 56% of our footwear unit volume.</p></blockquote>
<p>Domestic sales were still over half of total sales but it appears that domestic production was less than half.  So Croc is a net importer of shoes with most of their shoes made in China.  McCain is holding this company up as an example of how we can export more to the rest of the world but in truth, it is more of an example of how we purchase shoes made in places like China.  </p>

<p>From an economic, as well as a cost accounting, perspective how could anyone spend anyone else’s money without rudimentary knowledge of WHAT they could get for the MONEY?  What kind of system works without knowledge?  Where does truth come in the knowledge equation?</p>
<p>The gist of the report is that acquisition managers continuously accept less money than they need and accept the responsibility to make things happen.  Then, not being miracle workers; they have to take MUCH longer, get MUCH LESS performance and spend far MORE money than had they been given &#8220;enough&#8221; money to start with.</p>
<p>From my experience it is like the old &#8220;Name That Tune&#8221; game show.  Only in the case of defense acquisitions the acquisition manager, who will be gone before anyone realizes her mistakes, assures everyone the tune can be named in 5 notes, takes the money for the 5 notes and then after she is gone on to an ever more important assignment it is discovered that the tune needed closer to 20 notes to figure out and then a few dozen more notes to get the job done.</p>
<p>GAO notes that budgeting too little money results in more money and time to do the job.  Like weight on airplanes time drives cost as the defense establishment has lots of overhead and is often wrongfully viewed as a national asset which its mere existence, even inept, is worth the taxpayers&#8217; dough.</p>
<p>You can read the report about the need to have more knowledge of what is required and more knowledge of what the industry can do.  Neither of which are coming any time soon.</p>
<p>But not to worry, the F-35 will still be not needed when it is delivered ten years after the first acquisition managers said they could whittle that beak in 5 years for $120B.</p>
<p>All they are doing is whittling beaks…………………….<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />This one by reader ilsm</p>
<p>Rdan here:  ilsm has been using GAO reports as a vehicle to explain his experience in the industry over this series as agreed to with cactus but formed with my moderating.  There has been some concern that his explanations are too biased in particular ways, but I do not know whether this stems from this series or previous postings from last years.</p>
<p>As a confirmed conscientious objector (Navy based childhood and 1-0 exemption), I have no expertise in the matter except to help with damage from operations.  If someone has a counter-factual, send the posts.</p>

                                <p>by coberly</p>
<p>I was listening to radio for smart people the other day when they did  <br />a piece about the effect of high gas prices on the price of gas  <br />guzzling cars.</p>
<p>They followed the owner of a very high-end SUV as he drove into the  <br />used car lot and asked how much he could get for his car.  He told  <br />the radio person he just couldn&#8217;t afford the gas, and he was hoping  <br />to get about seventy thousand dollars for the car.  The appraiser  <br />came back with an offer of thirty thousand.  I am sure I heard the  <br />man wince; then he wandered off to think about it.</p>
<p>Here, the learned economist stepped up to the microphone and told the  <br />radio person that the owner of this SUV was about to make an  <br />irrational decision.</p>
<p>Look he said, last year gas was 3 dollars a gallon.  This year it is  <br />four.  So if he uses a thousand gallons a year, the difference is a  <br />thousand dollars.  And to save a thousand dollars he is about to lose  <br />40,000.</p>
<p>Well, I was thinking about the same thing myself, so I can&#8217;t be too  <br />hard on the economist;  but he sounded a little too smug for my  <br />taste, so I wondered.</p>
<p>First, I wondered if that thousand extra dollars for gas next year  <br />was just about a thousand dollars more than the man had to spend.  I  <br />don&#8217;t think economists have ever learned that a dollar is a much  <br />bigger deal to the man who has one less than he needs than it is to  <br />the man who has one more than he needs.</p>
<p>But then I imagined the man thinking:  If I sell the SUV for thirty  <br />thousand and turn around and buy a car for thirty thousand that gets  <br />30 miles to the gallon, instead of the 10 that the SUV gets, then  <br />after ten years I will have a car worth maybe ten thousand dollars,  <br />and I will have spent about 13,000 on gas.  But if I keep the SUV  <br />another ten years, even if I can get 30,000 for it then, I will have  <br />spent 40.000 on gas.  Looks to me like letting go of the SUV will  <br />cost me about 8,000 over ten years, but keeping it will cost me 10,000.</p>
<p>So the question is whether I need to have the 2600 a year between now  <br />and then more than I need the pleasure of owning that expensive car.</p>
<p>So who is right?  The hapless owner, or the learned economist?<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />This one by coberly</p>

                                <p>I don&#8217;t like talking about stocks. I believe the market is rigged, that the allocations do not favor the investor who is not also a senior executive of the company and/or a member of the Board of Directors, and that reported profits and losses on a quarterly basis is a lousy way to run a company.  And those are the moderate objections on a good day.*</p>
<p>That said, I have occasionally commented at Marginal Utility on the wisdom of investing in stocks. When not citing <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/2001/07/01/305196/index.htm">this article</a>, I often <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2006/06/interlude-1b-how-cheap-is-market.html">reprint a graphic</a> from Burton Malkiel&#8217;s <em>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</em>:
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3858/72/1600/malkiel257%20PE.0.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3858/72/400/malkiel257%20PE.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>This one is fairly easy to explain: when P/E multiples are running high in the market, mean reversion tends to happen.  No allocation requirements, no changes in attitude or latitude at the drop of a FedFunds rate: just reasonable odds of whether you will make money on the investment.</p>
<p>(Doesn&#8217;t mean you won&#8217;t make money, just means it&#8217;s &#8220;the way to bet.&#8221;)</p>
<p>So it comes as little surprise when Felix cites <a href="http://www.passionsaving.com/stock-valuation.html">&#8220;a handy tool&#8221; by Rob Bennett</a> &#8220;based on one of Robert Shiller&#8217;s favorite indicators, P/E10, or price to previous ten years&#8217; average earnings&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now, P/E10 is at about 22, which mean that stocks are expensive, by historical standards: Rob reckons that fair value, for stocks, is about 14 or 15, and that anything above 20 is &#8220;truly dangerous&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>There have been three occasions when we have gone to P/E10 levels above 20. On those three occasions, the average loss in the years that followed was 68 percent. So the general rule is to lower your stock allocation when the P/E10 level goes above 20.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Felix goes on to note several catches that amount to &#8220;past history is not necessarily a predictor of future events&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>For one thing, I just don&#8217;t think that many investors have anything like the requisite amount of patience needed &#8211; where you can happily sit back for a decade or two waiting for the P/E10 to come down to the mid-teens before going overweight equities.</p>
<p>And for another thing, I&#8217;m far from convinced that the behavior of the stock market a century ago, when both the world and corporate capital structures were very different from how they look now, can really teach us much about stock-market investing. I don&#8217;t believe that the stock-market asset class has rules which govern its long-term behavior, and I can easily believe that we will never again see the S&#038;P 500 trading on a P/E10 of less than 15. (It&#8217;s already been 20 years, and I certainly don&#8217;t believe that discount rates are likely to go back up to their 1988 levels any time soon.)</p></blockquote>
<p>But in the end, his argument comes down to the core issue of investing:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;ve worried for a while that stocks aren&#8217;t an attractive asset class any more. The problem, of course, is that there&#8217;s not very much in the way of alternatives. And in any case, according to Rob, if I put all my money in stocks today, I can expect a real return of 5.65% over the next 30 years; 4.65% would be unlucky. I&#8217;d be happy with that, I think.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you want to know why we occasionally get speculative bubbles in various markets, there may be no better explanation than that paragraph.</p>
<p>*I have no problem with the Churchillian assertion that it is &#8220;better than all others,&#8221; but taking that as a sign of encouragement requires a Pollyannaish, or at least <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/BDK-BPEA.pdf">DeLongian</a> [PDF], temperament.</p>

<p>AKA</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5257935">&#8216;Her Way&#8217;</a>; Obama Health Plan Could Go In Clinton&#8217;s Direction<br />Teddy Davis, John Santucci and Gregory Wallace  ABC News  06.29.2008</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama&#8217;s surrogate [Dr. Kavita Patel] made her comments Wednesday while representing him at a National Journal health-policy forum moderated by Ron Brownstein, the political director of Atlantic Media.</p>
<p>Patel&#8217;s individual mandate remarks were made in response to an insurance industry leader suggesting at the same forum that insurers will oppose Obama&#8217;s plan as currently structured. Insurers are worried that the Illinois Democrat has not tied an individual mandate to &#8220;guaranteed issue,&#8221; the industry&#8217;s term for requiring patients to be covered without regard to pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had the conversation about . . . guaranteed issue,&#8221; said Karen Ignagni, the president and CEO of America&#8217;s Health Insurance Plans. &#8220;But we are prepared to have that conversation in the insurance industry <bold>if</bold> the politicians are ready to stand up and say <bold>we are going to get everyone in.&#8221;</bold></p>
<p>Ignagni&#8217;s words are watched closely because the organization she heads emerged from the Health Insurance Association of America, sponsors of the &#8220;Harry and Louise&#8221; ads which played a critical role in killing Clinton&#8217;s effort to reform health-care in the 1990s.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t see that coming, but I should have. Obama&#8217;s plan has the part consumers like but has the problem that it would bankrupt the health insurance industry. Hmmm what if his plan was to terrify them into accepting universal health insurance with the public sector allowed to compete ? Current proposal sounds lovely. It would make it advantageous to the young and healthy to wait till they get sick to get insurance. The problem is that it could cause the industry to enter a death spiral.</p>
<p>But it sounds lovely. Do you want to bet your industry on your ability to stop the 46 year old African American major party nominee whose middle name is Hussein and who beat the police and the newly elected Democratic governor in a *unanimous* Illinois senate vote ? Better to deal I&#8217;d say. Maybe, just maybe, Ignagni really agrees with me that opposing Obama on a superficially appealing plan whose only fault is that it will destroy her industry is not a bright move.</p>
<p>And look at the headline from <a href="http://www.greenchange.org/"> Green Change</a>. We have Obama caving to the health insurance industry by accepting 100% universal health insurance (sort of like the time that he <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2007/11/i-agree-with-ed-kilgore-and-disagree.html">adopted Republican talking points</a> by proposing his donut social security funding huge progressive tax increase, class war, soak the rich and spread it out thin plan).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if he is is just brilliant or is also blessed.</p>

                                <p>Tyler Cowen takes <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2008/07/marriage_and_ca_1.html">a premise of Arnold Kling&#8217;s</a>:<br />
<blockquote>My guess is that most of the younger (aged 30-34) highly-educated folks are children of two highly-educated parents. My guess is that many of the older (aged 55-59) highly-educated folks are children of a college-educated father but not a college-educated mother.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we have a recipe that says, &#8220;Take a child of two non-college educated parents, add primary education ingredient X, bake, and out comes a college-capable high school graduate.&#8221; The mystery ingredient X has yet to be discovered.</p></blockquote>
<p>and <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/07/what-is-mystery.html">spins it as well as he can</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;m not sure that college education per se is the key here (and probably Arnold would agree; read his phrasing carefully).  If you can bake up some low rates of time preference, you&#8217;re coming pretty close to the real mystery ingredient.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, I&#8217;ll stick here for the answer that Kling alludes to without mentioning it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GI_Bill">The (original) G.I. Bill</a>, which is the reason many of those 55-59-year-olds had a college-educated father in the first place.</p>

<blockquote><p>From there, he authored the spending controls in the Budget Act of 1990. Those controls were ultimately responsible for the budget surpluses of the late 90s. McCain having him as an adviser is more telling than anything in this political press release.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation – we switched from deficits to surpluses because we reduced nondefense Federal spending – right?  WRONG!  We switched from deficits to surpluses for two reasons: (1) Federal taxes as a share of GDP rose from 18.6% to 20.9%; and (2) defense spending as a share of GDP fell from just over 6.4% to less than 3.8%.  While it is true that total Federal spending as a share of GDP fell, the nondefense component actually rose.  </p>
<p>Of course, we have to routinely endure another rightwing troll named FA who made this comment about what EconomistMom wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>However, the quote she is attacking says 1997, and taxes WERE cut in 1997, the Capital Gains tax was cut.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, EconomistMom knows this but she was talking about the 1993 income tax rate increase, which was the primary reason why Federal taxes as a share of GDP rose.  When this is pointed out to our resident troll, he comes back with this Laugher:</p>
<blockquote><p>taxes WERE cut and it wasn&#8217;t until after that cut that the economy had stellar growth</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC!</strong>  Of course, FA cannot point to a single economic analysis that would attribute real GDP growth exclusively or even partially to the 1997 reduction in the tax rate on capital gains.  I have to wonder how much the GOP pays these two village idiots.  Let’s hope it’s less than the minimum wage – otherwise, they are paying much more than these two dimwits are worth.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I am aware that the American Council for Capital Formation had DRI prepare something called “Capital Gains Taxes and the Economy: A Retrospective Look” back in June of 1999.  ACCF is an advocacy group so I would question whether something prepared on their behalf qualifies as an economic analysis.  But let’s go back to something from <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/9-20-01tax.htm">CBPP</a> entitled Would a Capital Gains Tax Cut Stimulate The Economy? published on September 20, 2001 when policymakers were last worried about a recession:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some Congressional leaders are promoting a proposal to reduce the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains from 20 percent to 15 percent. This reduction in the capital gains rate is being championed as a way to stimulate the economy. A reduction in the capital gains tax rate, however, is highly unlikely to provide a stimulus. In fact, it offers one of the least appropriate responses to the nation&#8217;s current economic challenges. Advocates of a capital gains tax cut have not traditionally claimed it has a stimulus effect. In the past, they have argued that it would provide long-term, rather than short-term, benefits for the economy. Even these long-run benefit arguments are weak. The Congressional Budget Office and other respected analysts have found that a capital gains tax cut would have very little impact on economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>How could anyone suggest that the 1997 reduction in capital gains tax rate was responsible for the economic boom of the 1990’s?  Oh yea – trolls are told by their political masters what to think!</p>

                                <p>UPDATE:  Brad DeLong lists some of the Usual Suspects <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/07/republican-econ.html">who are Not in the Line-up</a>.</p>
<p>John McCain&#8217;s <a href="http://johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/Read.aspx?guid=c90681b9-5dfe-4de4-8057-ceedb30c228d">300 economists</a> who support <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/mccains-claim-of-balancing-budget-dont.html">his Jobs for America Plan</a> (via Tyler Cowen, non-sociopath, who <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/07/statement-of-30.html">provides an appropriate context for the list</a>) includes one person, an Ike Brannon, whose affiliation is listed as &#8220;Department of the Treasury&#8221; and who, per <a href="http://www.treas.gov/organization/officials.html">this site</a>, is &#8220;Senior Advisor to the [Tax Policy] Assistant Secretary,&#8221; one <a href="http://www.treas.gov/organization/bios/solomon-e.html">Eric Solomon</a>.</p>
<p>My initial suspicion was that this might be a violation of the Hatch Act.  But that appears <a href="http://www.osc.gov/ha_fed.htm#may">not to be necessarily true</a>:<br />
<blockquote>These federal and D.C. employees may-</p>
<p>    * express opinions about candidates and issues<br />    * contribute money to political organizations<br />    * attend political fundraising functions<br />    * attend and be active at political rallies and meetings<br />    * join and be an active member of a political party or club<br />    * sign nominating petitions<br />    * campaign for or against candidates in partisan elections<br />    * make campaign speeches for candidates in partisan elections<br />    * distribute campaign literature in partisan elections<br />    * hold office in political clubs or parties</p></blockquote>
<p>So as long as Mr. Brannon didn&#8217;t sign the petition while &#8220;on duty [or] in a government office [or] using a government vehicle,&#8221; it appears he is clearly permitted to sign the petition.</p>
<p>Now, generally, these petitions are circulated through personal connections. So presumably someone knows Mr. Brannon and forwarded it to him at his personal e-mail address. And one would assume that Mr. Brannon, if he were enthusiastic about the petition, would forward it—in a manner not to violate the Hatch Act—to others, including co-workers.</p>
<p>And presumably those others would know that, so long as the contact was of a personal nature, they, too, could sign on to &#8220;support of John McCain&#8217;s Jobs for America economic plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The silence from the rest of the Treasury Department is deafening.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s missing the appropriate equations, so I suspect a few of the simplifying assumptions are skewed, and he doesn&#8217;t mention that the industry in question has always been at the forefront of new-technology which enabled it to reap this benefit, but the <a href="http://knzn.blogspot.com/2008/07/porn-and-transportation-are-substitutes.html">Substitution Effect discussed here</a> is almost as interesting as the <a href="http://www.sundayherald.com/international/shinternational/display.var.2381313.0.0.php">heroin/Kalishnikov exchange rate</a>.</p>
