                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/2007/10/29/071029on_onlineonly_surowiecki?currentPage=1">Tyler Cowen</a>, a link to a nice article on the Laffer Curve by <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/2007/10/29/071029on_onlineonly_surowiecki?currentPage=1">by James Surowiecki</a>.  Surowiecki notes that despite the facts and evidence, the current President, the current Vice President, and everyone vying to be the Republican nominee have all declared that cutting taxes raises revenues:</p>
<blockquote><p>This supply-side orthodoxy is striking in a couple of ways. First, it requires Republican politicians to commit themselves publicly to a position that is wrong—and wrong not as a matter of ideology or faith but as a matter of fact. Saying today that tax cuts will increase tax revenues is not like saying that bombing Iran constitutes a sensible foreign policy, or that education vouchers will wreck the public schools. It’s more like saying that the best way to treat sick people is to bleed them to let out the evil spirits. Second, despite the fact that the supply-side faith has no grounding in reality, within the Republican Party there is little room for dissent on the subject&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>And its a widespread belief.  But the danger of being able to believe in things that contradict the facts is not limited to that mistaken belief.  Someone who can avoid the facts in one area can avoid the facts in others.  And will.</p>
<p>Consider other widespread beliefs among the Republican faithful&#8230;  Republicans are the Party of Economic Growth. Or Republicans are the party of fiscal responsibility.  </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve covered all of these topics here at Angry Bear&#8230; in fact, regular readers know I&#8217;ve beaten both those topics to death, with a graphical summary of the results <a rhef="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">here</a>.  For those in a do-it yourself mood, wander over to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/hist.html">OMB Table 7.1</a>.  The last four Republican Presidential administrations &#8211; GW, GHW, Reagan, and Ford &#8211; have each increased the Federal debt held by the public (as a percentage of GDP).  In some cases (cough, Reagan, cough) by quite a bit.  By contrast, the last Democratic Party President to do so was FDR, and he was fighting WW2.  </p>
<p>Which brings us to the comment at <a href="http://betsyspage.blogspot.com/2007/10/its-about-packaging.html">Betsy&#8217;s Page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Democrats just can&#8217;t believe that sometimes, people actually like Republican ideas but must just be fooled by a deceptive message.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what happens if Republican ideas are a load of BS?  BS that sounds very good, and very appealing.  BS supported by &#8220;experts&#8221; &#8211; Harvard Professors, Business School Deans, etc. &#8211;  who provide assurance that yes, it really is true, there really is a free lunch.  </p>
<p>Who bears the blame, then, for the fact that &#8220;people actually like Republican ideas&#8221;?  To some extent, the suckers who fall for it.  But most people are busy, and don&#8217;t have time to pay attention to everything.  So they must rely on the experts.  Which means&#8230; those who have the time and wherewithal to check the facts, but instead continue selling snake oil are to blame.  The experts, but also the bloggers and reporters and editors who hide from the facts and repeat things they have to at least suspect is BS, or they&#8217;d be checking the data themselves.  And as a result, they&#8217;re to blame for a debt that is higher than it should be, for economic growth that is slower than it should be, and for the lives lost due to the lack of innovation that has resulted.</p>

David Hunt at (insert the Imperial March, aka Darth Vader&#8217;s theme) <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,304306,00.html">Fox News</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Besides, these things are of little consequence when you realize how we missed, squandered, screwed up, made a mess of and were massively risk adverse — again — when we did not kill Usama bin Laden in Afghanistan just two short months ago.</p>
<p>We know, with a 70 percent level of certainty — which is huge in the world of intelligence — that in August of 2007, bin Laden was in a convoy headed south from Tora Bora. We had his butt, on camera, on satellite. We were listening to his conversations. We had the world’s best hunters/killers — Seal Team 6 — nearby. We had the world class Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) coordinating with the CIA and other agencies. We had unmanned drones overhead with missiles on their wings; we had the best Air Force on the planet, begging to drop one on the terrorist. We had him in our sights; we had done it. Nice job again guys — now, pull the damn trigger.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, and in my opinion, criminally, we did not kill Usama bin Laden.</p>
<p>You cannot make this crap up; truth is always stranger and more telling than fiction. Our government, the current administration and yes, our military leaders included, failed to kill bin Laden for no other reason than incompetence.</p>
<p>The current “boneheads” in charge will tell you all day long that we are fighting and dying in Iraq and Afghanistan to stop terrorists there so they do not come here. Nice talk, how about — just for a moment — acting like you mean what you say? You know walk the walk. These incidents, where we displayed a total lack of guts, like the one in August, are just too prevalent. The United States of America’s political and military leadership has, on at least three separate occasions, chosen not capture or kill bin Laden or Ayman al-Zawahri. We have allowed Pakistan to become a safe haven for Al Qaeda. We have allowed Al Qaeda to reconstitute, partially because of money they (Al Qaeda in Iraq) have been sending to Al Qaeda in Pakistan.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear the details of this one.  If this isn&#8217;t just another example of someone on Fox News making up nonsense (but why make something up that makes GW look bad &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t they be putting the blame on Hillary?), my guess is that nobody was around to give the go-ahead.  GW was probably out mountain biking in the habitat of some endangered species, and Dick Cheney was in a secure location, listening in on someone&#8217;s phone conversations.  Since the Dark Lord strikes me as the kind of guy who isn&#8217;t big on his underlings taking matters into their own hands, with both he and GW out of the loop nothing can happen.  </p>
<p>Remember back in 2004 when they told us you shouldn&#8217;t change horses in the middle of a stream?  I wonder if the folks who bought that argument ever considered that the horse&#8217;s tendency to roll over onto its back in deep water wasn&#8217;t going to go away.</p>
<p>&#8212;-  </p>
<p>I think this story dovetails nicely with Dan&#8217;s post about Fox, Al Qaeda, and the fires CA.</p>

<blockquote><p>Transcript:<br />DOOCY: You’re looking live at pictures from San Diego — Santiago, CA, where the wildfires continue. We were talking earlier in today’s telecast with Adam Housley and apparently police officers in a hovering helicopter saw a guy starting one of these fires. And Allison Allison Camerota, an FBI memo from late in June of this year is popping up this morning and it is ominous.</p>
<p>CAMEROTA: This actually has happened for many years in the past as well. An FBI sent out to local law-enforcement said that an al Qaeda detainee had given them some information that the next wave of terrorism could be in the form of setting wild fires. Adam Housley said lots of people on his block were asking him about it. Obviously this is something the FBI has looked into. They will continue to investigate it.</p>
<p>CARLSON: If they have this person in custody it probably won’t take long to be able to develop a link if there is one.</p>
<p>KILMEADE: A June 25 memo from the FBI’s Denver offices reported three days ago, excuse me, five days ago, by the Arizona Republic, that is a newspaper, they have been carrying the story and they continue to expand upon it.</p>
<p>DOOCY: Brian, the plot they say, according to this detainee, and they don’t know if the detainee is telling the truth. The plot was to set three or four wildfires. But they don’t mention California. They mention Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming. We do know for a fact that a number of the fires in southern California are of a suspicious nature and they are investigating arson.</p></blockquote>
<p>I bet no one thought I could connect the two!</p>
<p>Actually, whether right or wrong, smart creative terrorists could cause havoc when required. Name some weak points not in the news. The tunnel collision linking N and S California highway systems. Computers in Utah funneling airport traffic data to coordinate national air traffic. Others?</p>

<blockquote><p>House Republicans are fuming over Democrats&#8217; decision to hold the next vote on the State Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program on Thursday &#8211; when many Republicans will be in California as President Bush tours areas hit by wildfires … At a meeting of Republican House members to discuss the revised bill, Rep. Louis Gohmert of Texas said the Democrats are &#8220;taking advantage of a disaster to loot the American treasury.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Look – John Boehner is not the Speaker.  Nancy Pelosi is.  And as the Republicans used to be fond of saying – elections have consequences.  Incidentally, my state is predominantly Democratic and as Stacey Bernards (spokesperson for Steny Hoyer) noted: “The fires aren’t partisan”.  Boehner and his ilk are on the losing side of this issue.  Their feigned anger at the timing of this vote is simply childish.  Too bad the minority leader in the House never grew up.</p>

<blockquote><p>Orders for American-made durable goods unexpectedly fell, led by a slump in military equipment that overshadowed increases in business investment.</p></blockquote>
<p>But could there be a silver lining?</p>
<blockquote><p>Demand for cars, planes and other items made to last several years fell 1.7 percent in September, the Commerce Department said today in Washington. At the same time, orders for and sales of computers and machinery, a proxy for capital spending, advanced. “Manufacturing will have slow-but-steady growth through the end of the year,” said Adam York, an economist in Charlotte, North Carolina, at Wachovia Corp., which had forecast orders would decline in September. The drop in total orders was “not quite as weak as the headline suggests.”  Record export demand will keep manufacturing growing, helping prevent the housing-market recession from sinking the broader economy, economists said. The gains in business investment prompted Morgan Stanley and Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, a St. Louis-based research group, to lift their estimates of third-quarter growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the drop in Federal defense purchases might soon be matched by increases in business investment and exports.  In other words, a rise in national savings that allows for a reverse crowding-out effect where the sum investment and net exports increase by the same amount? One can only hope!</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve been listening to the citizens of southern California pledging to rebuild their homes, again in the midst of fire and mudslide danger zones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about the risks to my homes, and the potential risks come out like this:</p>
<p>thunderstorm<br />(wind and hail)                  5%<br />sewer backup                     1%<br />blizzard                           .05%<br />flood                                .01%<br />home fire                        .01%<br />tornado                           .001%<br />hurricane                        .001%<br />earthquake                   .0001%<br />wildfire                         .0001%</p>
<p>These are not scientific numbers but I think are a good reflection of my risk profile.</p>
<p>I understand that insurance involves sharing risks, and that some have higher risks and other have lower risks.</p>
<p>However&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>At some point I&#8217;m not certain I want to share risks with people who build expensive homes in fire zones or build expensive homes on exposed beaches in hurricane areas.</p>
<p>California has too many people in places where there are high risks and a shortage of water. This is a result of 30 years of non-existant public policies on sprawl and internal migration.</p>
<p>So who pays?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Through the miracle of the intertubes, lately, when I&#8217;ve been making my breakfast, I&#8217;ve been listening to news from a radio station in Rio.  (I don&#8217;t know what they play when I&#8217;m not making breakfast, but the stream is <a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/cbn/wma/radiorj/wma.asp">here</a>.)  Anyway, its been raining heavily in Rio&#8230; and landslides have shut down a tunnel on the main artery connecting the &#8220;south&#8221; half of the city with the &#8220;north&#8221; half. </p>
<p>Each day, I learn exactly where the problems are, and what it means.  Today, in a fifteen minute stretch, there was a nice, in depth discussion about how its going to affect stores in shopping centers.  There was also an interview with a soil engineer.  I learned something from both interviews&#8230;  and not just about Rio.  And along the way, I learned precisely what to avoid if I was in Rio and was headed to work or wherever. </p>
<p>I contrasted that with my experience fiddling with the radio trying to figure out what was going on the other day when I was at my Mom&#8217;s house and we were trying to decide whether to evacuate.  The sky was black, we knew there were fires on two sides of us, but that&#8217;s about it. And the tv and the radio would only tell us about Malibu, because, well, Malibu is the only place that matters around here. </p>
<p>And unrelated to fires and rains, I realized I don&#8217;t even listen to American radio any more.  Quite simply&#8230; I haven&#8217;t found any stations where I learn anything.  And I don&#8217;t watch the news either, plus I really don&#8217;t think CNN &#8211; the version we get here in the US at least &#8211;  holds a candle to just about any station&#8217;s evening news show in Brazil or Argentina.  </p>
<p>Am I wrong about this?  And if not, why does American news suck?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/03/AR2007090300933.html?nav=emailpage">The Washington Post reports:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently issued a flier to combat myths about the flu vaccine. It recited various commonly held views and labeled them either &#8220;true&#8221; or &#8220;false.&#8221; Among those identified as false were statements such as &#8220;The side effects are worse than the flu&#8221; and &#8220;Only older people need flu vaccine.&#8221;</p>
<p>When University of Michigan social psychologist Norbert Schwarz had volunteers read the CDC flier, however, he found that within 30 minutes, older people misremembered 28 percent of the false statements as true. Three days later, they remembered 40 percent of the myths as factual.</p>
<p>Younger people did better at first, but three days later they made as many errors as older people did after 30 minutes. Most troubling was that people of all ages now felt that the source of their false beliefs was the respected CDC.</p>
<p>The psychological insights yielded by the research, which has been confirmed in a number of peer-reviewed laboratory experiments, have broad implications for public policy. The conventional response to myths and urban legends is to counter bad information with accurate information. But the new psychological studies show that denials and clarifications, for all their intuitive appeal, can paradoxically contribute to the resiliency of popular myths.</p>
<p>This phenomenon may help explain why large numbers of Americans incorrectly think that Saddam Hussein was directly involved in planning the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and that most of the Sept. 11 hijackers were Iraqi. While these beliefs likely arose because Bush administration officials have repeatedly tried to connect Iraq with Sept. 11, the experiments suggest that intelligence reports and other efforts to debunk this account may in fact help keep it alive.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have not much to add at the moment, running late. Something to keep in mind, and  truth cuts three ways most of the time.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Someone from country Xyz can immigrate to our country if they bring a couple million bucks and agree to start a business that employees fifty or more. &#8212;  Implies that such an immigrant adds to the economy, doesn’t it?  No doubt, dropping the couple million into an economy would have an effect, but starting a business that competes with an existing isn’t going to help much; might even be a negative.  Say your invitee started a business and employed illegals to make a product that an existing business employing natives was making, and competed in the same market – probably a net loss for your country, no?  Even if the invitee uses native labor to make a product that was already being made domestically, there’s no net gain to the Nation’s economy unless the invitee’s product either addresses a new domestic market, or is exported.</p>
<p>What’s America’s actual, for real, net from globalization/free trade?  On the plus side, billions and billions, maybe trillions, increased return to investors, and oodles of cheap stuff at Wal-Mart.  But, there are negatives. Suppose, for example, that more than thirty million American workers saw their wages or salaries fall behind an average of six thousand dollars per year for the past ten years?   That’s $1.8 trillion.  And, suppose, for example, that crime increased due to the reduced living standard for an additional cost to the Nation of, say, $200 billion over the ten years?</p>
<p>Where the plant stood, a plant that once &#8211; long time ago in 1980 &#8211; employed a thousand workers, now squats a better than nothing self-storage for storing all the stuff people buy that they don’t need, worth maybe $10 million.  When it was operating and profitable, the plant was a sizable asset, worth say one-half $billion.  Long since relocated to China, it’s off the Nation’s books, so the jobs.  One-thousand jobs averaging say $30 k/year over ten years represent a loss of $300 million; plus the $490 million asset loss; multiply the two by the tens of thousands of plants lost and you’re talking tens of billions of more dollars lost to the economy. </p>
<p>Wall Street loves McDonalds.  Pays dividends, provides cheap eats, and so it must be good.  What about the rest of America?   Is America better off without the waitress/waiter making union wages?  What’s the net?   Recall the fastfoodies’ hand wringing over an increase in minimum wage?  “We’re providing entry-level jobs”, they said, i.e., they were training the Nation’s youth to be good future employees.  Appears they meant the nations of Mexico and Guatemala.  Ah, but we still have choices in restaurants; McDonald’s, Burger King, Jack-in-the Box, Taco Bell, … and either Chinese or Mexican.  Again, what’s the net if a Chinese, or Mexican restaurant opens and runs the local coffee shop out of business? </p>
<p>In some cities, trains and buses always served the Airport.  Now, BART and Muni-Busses serve SFO direct.  But they didn’t for some fifty years.  Oh it wasn’t that people didn’t want such service – getting to and from SFO was a big pain, but, you see; there was this hand full of parking lot owners, jitney operators, limo-services, taxi companies, … who, ever election cycle, greased the palms of local politicians and reminded them of the extended voting families that were dependent on the status quo.  My point? The hiring of illegals in SF, too, is based on what’s best for the few vs. what’s good for the community.  While, some Chinese illegals are working off indenture, and the Mexicans, Guatemalans, … are in a race to the bottom for wages, native San Franciscan laborers, painters, gardeners, roofers, waiters/waitresses, … are out of luck.  And, ‘tis so because a few restaurants, hotels, … are greasing politicos palms while reminding them of the large Latin/Asian vote.</p>
<p>As I recall, John Kenneth Galbraith thought that a nation’s economy should serve the Nation’s populace.  If I’m right about this, he got it right.</p>
<p>Am I placing too much blame on trade and immigration?  Yes.  The problem of resources was always there, and is huge.  And, it would have been better if the Nation had had the time to adjust to automation alone and before globalization struck. </p>

                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/10/the-cost-of-the.html">Mark Thoma</a> brings us the latest estimate from the CBO.  I just read the USA Today coverage of this and Dean Baker would be happy to know that this paper translated the $2.4 trillion into $8000 per person.  Of course, Bill Kristol estimated the cost of this war to be only $20 billion back in late 2002.  Off by a factor of 120 isn’t that bad – is it?  But Bill might also remind us of all those benefits from this war.  Let’s start a list:</p>
<p>(1) The invasion of Iraq has made Iran the big battle one on the block.  More excuses for Dick Cheney’s next war.</p>
<p>(2) The invasion of Iraq has revived Al Qaeda.  More excuses for Republicans to attack Democrats as if we don’t care about the looming terrorist threat.</p>
<p>(3) The lead-up to this invasion led to a 2002 GOP victory and the actual invasion led to the reelection of Bush-Cheney in 2004.  OK, there was little setback in 2006, but notice how the GOP candidates on renewing their spin that only Republicans can save us from another 9/11 by more wars in the Middle East?  For these guys, the Iraq War seems to be the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
<p>Now I’m sure our readers can provide more “benefits” in the same manner so have fun.</p>
