I know I was surprised to read this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Non-Hispanic whites had a higher percentage of ever using cocaine or street drugs (23.5 percent) than blacks (18 percent) or Mexican-Americans (16 percent).</p></blockquote>
<p>Data might be skewed a bit by this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The survey, formally titled the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, did not include the homeless, prisons inmates or other institutionalized adults.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, I don&#8217;t think this skews the data enough to fit with the preconceptions I&#8217;ve developed over the years.</p>
<p>So what does one do when one sees information that doesn&#8217;t match one&#8217;s prior world view?  Well, one can disregard it completley &#8211; my favorite example is still <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/does-australia-exist.html">this</a>.  Or one can change one&#8217;s mind.  Or, if one is a skeptic, one can change one&#8217;s mind as a preliminary position, and hope to find more information that confirms what is going on one way or the other.</p>
<p>Anyone have any more information?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/22/us/politics/22edwards.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">Leslie Wayne</a> hoping to get a job with the National Review?</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Edwards, who reported this year that he had assets of nearly $30 million, came up with a novel solution, creating a nonprofit organization with the stated mission of fighting poverty. The organization, the Center for Promise and Opportunity, raised $1.3 million in 2005, and &#8211; unlike a sister charity he created to raise scholarship money for poor students &#8211; the main beneficiary of the center’s fund-raising was Mr. Edwards himself, tax filings show.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you had a successful career and are now rich, you cannot be truly concerned about poverty.  Am I reading some transcript from Sean Hannity’s show or what?  Leslie Wayne continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>But it was his use of a tax-exempt organization to finance his travel and employ people connected to his past and current campaigns that went beyond what most other prospective candidates have done before pursuing national office. And according to experts on nonprofit foundations, Mr. Edwards pushed at the boundaries of how far such organizations can venture into the political realm. Such entities, which are regulated under Section 501C-4 of the tax code, can engage in advocacy but cannot make partisan political activities their primary purpose without risking loss of their tax-exempt status. Because the organization is not required to disclose its donors &#8211; and the campaign declined to do so &#8211; it is not clear whether those who gave money to it did so understanding that they were supporting Mr. Edwards’s political viability as much or more than they were giving money to combat poverty.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds a lot like a Tom DeLay ploy!  But <a href="http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2007/jun/22/edwards_campaign_times_refused_to_talk_to_beneficiaries_of_his_anti_poverty_programs">Greg Sargent</a> details the Edwards side of the story including this:</p>
<blockquote><p>But we&#8217;ve just learned something new and surprising about the story. The Edwards campaign has just told us on the record that The Times refused the chance to talk to any real, live beneficiaries of Edwards&#8217; programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg continues with this review of what Leslie Warren wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>We think these lines are highly charged with innuendo in a way that&#8217;s beneath the Paper of Record. They stray into mind-reading and indulge in motive assessment. They lack factual specificity. Given how potentially damaging they are &#8211; and simultaneously how murky they are &#8211; they should not have been permitted by the editors to get onto the paper&#8217;s front page. Unless the paper&#8217;s editors no longer mind murky innuendo on A1 above the fold.  But if you are going to put such lines on your front page &#8211; if you are going to publish an enormous story alleging that a person&#8217;s antipoverty program was set up mainly to benefit the person who set it up &#8211; then basic journalistic fairness would dictate that you make a genuine effort to see how the program fulfilled its &#8220;stated&#8221; purpose of helping people. Surprisingly, no mention of how the programs actually impacted people appears until the story&#8217;s 18th paragraph &#8211; and at that point it comes from the mouth of an Edwards spokesman. There&#8217;s no indication that the reporter made any genuine independent effort at all to discover whether the programs helped anyone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg provides links to other bloggers who have condemned this op-ed dressed up as journalism.  If the NY Times does the right thing and fires this “reporter”, I’m sure the National Review will be happy to let Leslie Warren write for them.</p>

                                <p>Regular readers may recall various installments of the saga of McGinty (a.k.a. the Big Pooper).  When we found her, she was living behind a dumpster and had a horrible ear infection.  Gradually we were able to befriend her, and then get close to her.  And then we betrayed her trust by rudely shoving her in a box and dragging her off to the vet.</p>
<p>But she&#8217;s forgiving &#8211; since then she&#8217;s been acting as my personal assistant on a daily basis&#8230; she&#8217;s sitting right next to me as I type.  Indoor living and an honest job has been good for her&#8230; the ear infection is long gone (though her ear will always look like cauliflower), the fleas are no more, and she&#8217;s gone from 16 pounds to just under 21 since October.  </p>
<p>She&#8217;s also become something of a princess&#8230;  she will only drink running water.  This began when she learned of the magical properties of first the bathroom sink, and later the kitchen sink.  It wasn&#8217;t unusual to find her sitting on the toilet or the kitchen counter, waiting for someone to come by to make one of the sinks do its thing.  Eventually we had to buy one of them pet fountain thingies&#8230; </p>
<p>But even with the fountain, every so often we find her sitting on the toilet waiting, because every so often, only the sink will do&#8230;</p>

                                <p>For the past six years, we have seen so many failures from this Federal government that one has to wonder if anyone is in charge.  <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/11216.html">Steve Benen</a> brings us the latest from Dana Perino who seems to have confirmed that no one is indeed in charge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Q: What do you make of what congressman Waxman referred to as “absurd,” which was the Vice President’s contention that his office is not part of the executive branch?<br />PERINO: What I think, as I said, I think that is an interesting constitutional question that people can debate. What I think is absurd is  <br />Q: Would you agree with his contention?<br />PERINO: What I think is absurd <br />Q: Hang on a second. Do you agree with his contention?<br />PERINO: What I think is absurd is Chairman Waxman asserting some sort of authority over the president in regarding [sic] an executive order, of which he is the sole enforcer.<br />Q: Would you agree with the contention that the office of the Vice President is not part of the executive branch?<br />PERINO: What I know &#8211; and I am not a lawyer and this is an interesting legal question that legal scholars can debate and I’m sure you’ll find plenty of them inside the Beltway &#8211; is that the Vice President has a unique role in our United States government. He is not only the Vice President of the United States, but in that role he is also the President of the Senate. I will go ahead, I will let that debate be held, but what I’m answering questions on, in regards to this morning, is Chairman Waxman’s accusations about this small provision and going back and reading the E.O. and realizing that the President did not intend to have the Vice President treated any differently than himself, and remembering that the executive order is enforced solely by the president of the United States. I think this is a little bit of a non-issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steve reminds us of Article II of our Constitution.  But let’s step back for a second.  Cheney says the Vice President is not part of the Executive Branch.  And Dana says: “the President did not intend to have the Vice President treated any differently than himself”.  I guess this means President Bush is not part of the Executive Branch.  This does explain a lot about the last six years!</p>

                                <p>The news is full of stories on the tragedy at King/Harbor (fka King/Drew) Hospital.</p>
<p>A woman with a perforated bowel laid on the floor in her own vomit and died while the staff ignored or insulted her.</p>
<p>To those of us in the healthcare business, this is no surprise, because King/Drew has been a disaster area for years and years.</p>
<p>So why is it still open?</p>
<p>Politicians.</p>
<p>To be fair to the politicians, much of the impetus to keep the hospital open has been the need to keep a hospital in that geographical area. Nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>But if the hospital is to stay open someone has to have a commitment to fixing the problems and keeping them fixed. This requires daily attention for years and maybe decades.</p>
<p>Politicians are not very good at long term commitments.</p>
<p>I understand the politicians have done a good job of protecting jobs, including those of incompetent employees. There will never be quality care until that ends, but is unlikely. This is one of the failings of some politicians, especially on the labor-left.</p>
<p>So if you live in the King/Harbor area, what is your preference?</p>
<p>1) keep King/Harbor open, because a lousy hospital is better than nothing<br />2) close King/Harbor, and hope the ambulance drivers can drive really fast</p>
<p>Not much of a choice.</p>
<p>Update: The State of California has started proceedings to revoke K/H’s license.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post is on child mortality and how its changed over time in the US. Why child mortality? Well, I want a good measure of health care. I had a few posts on the topic in the past, and it seems whenever you mention mortality rates, especially in the context of international comparisons where the US doesn’t look good relative to other developed countries, someone always pipes up about how Americans make unhealthy choices, like eating greasy crud and standing in the way of rapidly moving lead. People also like to point out that Americans have inferior genetics. </p>
<p>OK. Fine. But at the other end of the spectrum, infant mortality (i.e., the death rate of children under one year of age, leaving out fetal deaths) shouldn’t be as affected by Cheetos, bullets, and a tendency toward adult-onset diabetes. So let’s go with that. </p>
<p>Data for this post comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0076.xls">Table 76 of the Statistical Abstract of the United States</a>. So here’s the graph…</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rnu1H5umkkI/AAAAAAAAAUA/vsM2zq_rvD8/s1600-h/Infant+mortality,+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rnu1H5umkkI/AAAAAAAAAUA/vsM2zq_rvD8/s320/Infant+mortality,+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Fortunately, infant mortality seems to be dropping. Unfortunately, that rate of decrease does seem to be leveling off in the last decade or so. </p>
<p>Next, we have a summary of the results.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rnu1BJumkjI/AAAAAAAAAT4/W0y5Q4i7Iq8/s1600-h/Infant+mortality,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rnu1BJumkjI/AAAAAAAAAT4/W0y5Q4i7Iq8/s320/Infant+mortality,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The summary confirms that improvements have slowed down as of late. A big drop occurred after 1996, and an even bigger one after GW took office. Interestingly enough, things were particular good under Presidents (before this one) for whom the confidence about the future wasn’t that great, such as Carter and GHW. </p>
<p>And now an international comparison… this is the data for all countries for which <a href="http://devdata.worldbank.org/hnpstats/query/default.html">The World Bank’s Health, Nutrition and Population data platform</a> has data. </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rnu05JumkiI/AAAAAAAAATw/PuOsNsLY4IU/s1600-h/Infant+mortality,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rnu05JumkiI/AAAAAAAAATw/PuOsNsLY4IU/s320/Infant+mortality,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Well, we do inch out Cuba. But if we do better than any major comparable industrialized countries I’m not seeing it right now. Now, I’m sure someone will say that different countries measure infant mortality differently. I wouldn’t mind seeing a reputable cite. I can believe the data coming out of Somalia is awful, but I find it hard to believe that the difference between us and other OECD countries that spend a lot less on health care, like Japan or Germany or France, is due to differences in counting.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="http://uanews.org/cgi-bin/WebObjects/UANews.woa/3/wa/SRStoryDetails?ArticleID=9306">According to a University of Arizona researcher</a>,  ”society is losing $2.4 billion per year because the Colorado River&#8217;s water” no longer flows all the way to the Gulf of California. </p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s the first dollar estimate of the benefits society would get from the natural functioning of a healthy Colorado River delta. </p>
<p>Functioning ecosystems provide benefits, known as ecosystem services, to humans. However, so much Colorado River water has been dammed or diverted for human uses that the river&#8217;s delta no longer works the way it used to. </p>
<p>&#8220;The day-to-day functioning of ecosystems provides benefits,&#8221; said Karl W. Flessa, a professor in UA&#8217;s department of geosciences. &#8220;What I&#8217;ve done is estimate what&#8217;s the value to society if you just leave the water in the river. Human populations are losing that value when the water is diverted for other purposes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote><p>Flessa argues that the price water users pay should reflect the cost to society. </p>
<p>&#8220;The price we pay for Colorado River water should include the cost of lost ecosystem services,&#8221; Flessa said. &#8220;Included in the price of water should be mitigation costs for the environmental consequences of diverting water.&#8221; </p>
<p>The additional amount users should pay for the water could be used for ecosystem restoration in the delta, he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>…<br />
<blockquote>Other researchers have calculated the monetary value of services provided to society by various ecosystems, including natural floodplains, natural estuaries, deserts, ocean shelf and croplands. <br />Flessa applied those figures to the land area of the Colorado River delta to get the dollar value of ecosystem services provided by the region before all the dams and water diversions. He then figured out what ecosystem services are provided by the current land use types in the delta region. The difference between the two figures is the benefit lost to society: 6 cents per 100 gallons of water diverted, or $2.4 billion annually. </p></blockquote>
<p>…<br />
<blockquote>He cautions that his analysis is limited to the environmental impacts of the changes. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to say this is a net loss. We have the cities like Phoenix and Tucson. We also have the market value of the crops raised.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The author does not advocate methods of including costs in prices, but it does bring up the notion of how economics and markets might include costs in the new world of water in the southwest and west coast that are not the usual thoughts.  Can neo-classical economics help in this matter other than saying private markets only, which will not happen.  This math is beyond my level of understanding.<br />Also he does not mention that the delta is in Mexican territory, so the loss of the delta resources is theirs as well.  My guess is the price of water using transportation like oil would become more than high enough to begin serious desalination, and thus encourage the Great Lakes area and Canada from forming their own union around water wars with the rest of the country.  The costs to trade on the lakes would be enormous as well if the lakes drop much further from (minus the 12 inch to 18 inch) levels of other years.  They may look like they live next to a big swimming pool, but be very careful about answers.  They are as tough as Texans!</p>

                                <p>On this first day of summer, <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_06_17_archive.html#7743949961927516267">Atrios reminds us</a> of a story from earlier this year:</p>
<blockquote><p>BAGHDAD, Jan 15 (Reuters) &#8211; A major U.S.-backed operation to curb militia violence in Baghdad will take at least six months and is probably the final chance for the increasingly shaky government, senior Iraqi political sources said. </p>
<p>Operations were expected to begin next week and last for as long as seven months, one source said. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and U.S. President George W. Bush have announced plans to reinforce the capital with thousands of Iraqi and U.S. troops to smother the sectarian violence that is pitching Iraq towards all-out civil war. </p>
<p>The top U.S. general in Iraq said on Monday some had already arrived. </p>
<p>Bush has said the operation will &#8220;in large part determine the outcome in Iraq&#8221; and senior Iraqi officials from the Shi&#8217;ite Islamist majority dominating the government said they believed it was a &#8220;last chance&#8221; that must be implemented thoroughly. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>U.S. General George Casey warned on Monday not to expect instant results, saying he foresaw a &#8220;gradual evolution&#8221; over two to three months and then better security by the summer. </p>
<p>The political sources said that there were only some logistics to finalise, such as bringing additional troops into Baghdad. Officials wanted to ensure the broadest possible political support for the operation, including from radical Shi&#8217;ite leaders such as young cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK. So what was the take-away? Some improvement by summer, the plan runs its course by six or seven months from a week after the article was written, say, by the end of July or August, and this was the last chance for success from the Iraqi perspective.</p>
<p>Its summer. Are we seeing some improvement? I don&#8217;t know. In some neighborhoods of Baghdad. Will the improvement remain? Who knows? And it has gotten worse in some other areas.</p>
<p>But one thing is certain&#8230; even the administration and the Generals have severely backpedaled on showing progress by then. As with everything else involving Iraq, this particular set of goalposts has already been moved a pretty good distance. And I don&#8217;t think its going out on a limb to say they will be moved again. And again.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I wrote about the surge <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/william-kristol-on-surge.html">at about the same time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But I think the bigger problem is something else. I hope GW pulls it off. If he won&#8217;t withdraw the troops, then I hope at least they manage to do something positive. But let&#8217;s be realistic. This is GW. Its not just the war that he fails at.. consider his other big promise from even earlier.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope he proves me wrong. Lives are stake. The lives of American troops, the lives of Iraqi troops and the lives of Iraqi civilians. There&#8217;s also a lot of money that could be spent elsewhere &#8211; that could be used to save lives in the US or abroad. If GW pulls it off, I&#8217;ll eat crow, and I&#8217;ll do it happily. But&#8230;</p>
<p>In six months, it will be evident to almost everything that GW has failed again. In two years, it will be evident even to Kristol. And then what? If Iraq is vital now, too vital to leave, why won&#8217;t it be too vital to leave then? Will Kristol feel we owe the troops Plan J or Plan K, both of which are virtually identical to Plans A through Plan I, differing only in how many years they get stop-lossed? Will he simply dust off this article and submit it again?</p></blockquote>
<p>I was naive. Its not evident to everyone. There are people for whom it still isn&#8217;t evident that there were no WMDs in Iraq, or that Saddam was behind 9/11, after all. So I will be wrong about that. But given all the backpedaling, it seems its already evident to the administration and the generals that what we were told is not going to happen.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/6-21-07bud.htm">Richard Kogan</a> reviews this GOP spin:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Administration has charged that these funding levels represent large, fiscally irresponsible increases in federal spending that would threaten fiscal stability and the economy.  It has threatened to veto most of the forthcoming appropriations bills.  The Administration’s sharp criticisms have been echoed by a number of Republican congressional leaders, such as Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-CA), the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee, who accused the Democratic majority of “spending lust.”  Some 147 House Republican members &#8211; more than one-third of the House membership &#8211; have pledged to sustain the anticipated vetoes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Richard says this GOP spin is at odds with the facts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some 81 percent of the $53.1 billion increase in appropriations under the emerging bills consists of increases for military and homeland security programs that the President himself requested.  (These increases are not related to Iraq and Afghanistan, which are classified as “emergency spending” and hence not included in this analysis.) This 81 percent figure climbs still higher when one takes into account the congressional increases for the State Department and international affairs that the Administration also requested. Less than one-tenth (or $5 billion) of the $53.1 billion funding increase reflected in the congressional targets for the 2008 appropriations bills is for increases for the eight domestic appropriations bills.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s review his table one that compares inflation-adjusted 2007 spending to the proposals from the White House versus Congress.  The $53.1 billion increase that Congress is proposing represents a 5.9% increase in total discretionary programs.  This breaks down into the following components:</p>
<p>Military/Homeland Security is $45.7 billion, which is an 8.9% increase.</p>
<p>International Programs is $2.4 billion, which is a 7.4% increase.</p>
<p>Domestic Spending is $5 billion, which is a 1.4% increase.  </p>
<p>The White House proposal arrives at an increase of only $29.8 billion by advocating that domestic spending be reduced by $16.4 billion.  OK, if domestic spending is supposed to be reduced in real terms, isn’t time for the GOP to fess up which specific programs get slashed?</p>

<p>As another follow-up to <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2007/06/apples-to-apple.html">David Altig</a>, let me offer a bit of evidence provided by <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2">FRED</a> (the Federal Reserve Economic Data) courtesy of the St. Louis FED.  FRED provides a quarterly series of a measure of potential GDP (GDP* in my table) from the Congressional Budget Office.  I have taken my four data points (1980QIV, 1992QIV, 2000QIV, and 2006QIV) and shown actual GDP (2000$) versus potential GDP.  The GDP gap is also calculated to be around 2.4% as of 1980IV, 1.4% as of 1992QIV, negative 1.6 percent as of 2000QIV, and 2006QIV.  From this, I compare the average annual GDP growth rates to the average annual growth rates in potential GDP.  </p>
<p>As you look at the calculated GDP gaps, you might be thinking like me – don’t they look rather small?  But suppose we add 0.6% to each figure – making our revised gap 3% when Carter left office, 2% when Bush41 left office, and around 1% now.  Of course, we would still be showing real GDP above potential GDP about the time that Dick Cheney was to replace Al Gore as the Vice President.  Didn’t Cheney say we were in a recession at the end of 2000?  Or something like that?  Whether we use the CBO gap figures or my suggested modification, the implied growth rates in potential GDP would be about the same.  </p>
<p>I need to slightly alter something from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/david-altig-schools-me-on-business.html">this post</a> with respect to this claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>My case for using this time frame to estimate long-term growth is that we were in similar situations in regards the business cycle at the beginning of my 12 year period and at the end of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>What we see in our table is that the gap was smaller just before Clinton took office than just before Reagan took office.  So the 3.04% average annual growth rate for the Reagan-Bush41 era actually slightly overstates the growth in potential GDP.  Of course, this confirms David’s point that potential GDP during the Clinton years was less than actual GDP growth, while actual growth over the past six years understates potential growth.  But notice something: 3.2% still trumps the less than 3.0% growth in potential GDP that we’ve seen from those tax deferral Administrations.  </p>
<p>So could it be – fiscal irresponsibility ala free lunch supply-side tax cuts is bad not only in terms of reducing national savings and long-term growth but also in terms of Keynesian macroeconomic stabilization policy?  The GOP predicted that the 1993 tax increase would be followed by a recession, but as David points out, we didn’t see this predicted recession.</p>
