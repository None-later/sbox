<p>Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/12/show-me-the-collateral-blogging-one-of-the-three-major-market-failures-underlying-our-current-difficulties.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal+%28Brad+DeLong%27s+Semi-Daily+Journal%29">discussed this</a> on December 21, riffing off David Wessel&#8217;s piece where he <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203686204577112172217398492.html">jumps on the bandwagon</a> with a tarted-up version of the Credit Suisse chart.</p>
<p>David Beckworth has the best <a href="http://macromarketmusings.blogspot.com/2011/12/why-global-shortage-of-safe-assets.html">commentary</a> I&#8217;ve found on the subject so far:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;many of these safe assets serve as transaction assets and thus either back or act as a medium of exchange.  AAA-rated MBS or sovereigns have served as collateral for repurchase agreements, which Gary Gorton has shown were the equivalent of a deposit account for the shadow banking system.   The disappearance of safe assets therefore means the disappearance of money for the shadow banking system. </p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine.</p>
<p>This prompts me to suggest a radical idea that I&#8217;ve been hesitant to broach for fear of revealing myself to be the internet econocrank that I am: that all financial assets are, in some very real or at least useful definitional sense, &#8220;money&#8221; &#8212; even though you can&#8217;t necessarily use them to buy a pack of gum at the corner store (you have to trade them for something currency-like first). I&#8217;ll get back to that in a future post.</p>
<p>Izabella Kaminska made a <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2011/11/29/768121/ecb-as-pawnbroker-of-last-resort-polr/">similar point</a> back in November:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;quality collateral has become the most sought over security in town. So much so, in fact, that some quality collateral is hardly circulating.</p>
<p>&#8230;the best indicator of collateral crunch intensity is instead the repo rate. The lower the rate, the greater the crunch.</p>
<p>The wider the spread between Libor and the secured (repo) rate, the greater the general distress in the market. The following chart reveals just how good an indicator of general market stress it is:</p>
<p><a href="http://av.r.ftdata.co.uk/files/2011/11/111129-Izzy-Chart.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" height="385" src="http://av.r.ftdata.co.uk/files/2011/11/111129-Izzy-Chart.jpg" title="European 3M Repo Rate over 3M Libor - Reuters" width="561"></a></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Some quality collateral is hardly circulating.&#8221; That starts to sound decidedly like a &#8220;velocity of money&#8221; argument.</p>
<p>And indeed, Cardiff Garcia frames it just this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, if you’ve read your <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp11256.pdf" target="_blank" title="Velocity of Pledged Collateral:  Analysis and Implications - IMF working paper">Manmohan Singh</a> (or your <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2011/12/01/775341/draghi-we-are-aware-of-the-scarcity-of-eligible-collateral/" target="_blank" title="Draghi: “We are aware of the scarcity of eligible collateral” - FT">Izzy Kaminska</a> or your <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/638fc5de-19c1-11e1-ba5d-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1fcHA3r47" target="_blank" title="Financial system creaks as loan lubricant dries up - FT">Tracy Alloway</a>), you’ll know that this availability is the first of two parts of the collateral shortfall effect. The other part is the shortening of “re-pledging chains”, otherwise known as a reduction in the velocity of collateral and which Singh explains thusly:</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>Intuitively, this means that collateral from a primary source takes ‘fewer steps’ to reach the ultimate client. This results from reduced supply of collateral from the primary source clients due to counterparty risk of the dealers, and the demand for higher quality collateral by the ultimate clients.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>And why does it matter? Singh again, emphasis ours:</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>The “velocity of collateral”—analogous to the concept of the “velocity of money”—indicates the liquidity impact of collateral. A security that is owned by an economic agent and can be pledged as re-usable collateral leads to chains. Thus, a shortage of acceptable collateral would have a negative cascading impact on lending similar to the impact on the money supply of a reduction in the monetary base.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Brad DeLong gives us some theory that will sound familiar to readers of my recent posts:</p>
<blockquote><p>And when an economy is short of AAA assets, it can fall into a recession &#8212; but not a monetarist or a Wicksellian recession, rather an Minskyite recession&#8211;because in the absence of long-enough collateral chains the web of banking intermediation would have to run on trust that isn&#8217;t there.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, emphasis mine.</p>
<p>The upshot: the global economy needs more <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/1998/08/babysitting_the_economy.html">babysitting scrip</a>. Since money issuers continue to labor under the gold-standard fallacy that they can&#8217;t just create money, issue more scrip like the babysitting co-op did &#8212; that they have to &#8220;borrow&#8221; it (and this stricture is inscribed in law) &#8212; the only way to create that scrip is for governments to issue more bonds. So banks can issue money using those bonds as collateral, allowing shadow banks to keep their collateralized towers from teetering.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a stunningly byzantine and dysfunctional approach to managing the supply of money to the real economy that produces human-consumable goods and services (though it works out very nicely for the bankers, personally). But it&#8217;s what we&#8217;re stuck with.</p>
<p>If this doesn&#8217;t make sense to you, try <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;ion=1#sclient=psy-ab&#038;hl=en&#038;site=webhp&#038;source=hp&#038;q=%22modern+monetary+theory%22&#038;pbx=1&#038;oq=%22modern+monetary+theory%22&#038;aq=f&#038;aqi=g4&#038;aql=&#038;gs_sm=s&#038;gs_upl=0l0l2l573l0l0l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0&#038;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&#038;fp=83f521698d4ca423&#038;ion=1&#038;biw=1279&#038;bih=679">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Some of the biggest companies in the United States have been firing workers and in some cases lobbying for rules that depress wages at the very time that jobs are needed, pay is low, and the federal budget suffers from a lack of revenue.<br />Last month Citizens for Tax Justice and an affiliate issued <a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2011/11/ctj.html">Corporate Taxpayers and Corporate Tax Dodgers 2008-10</a>. It showed that 30 brand-name companies paid a federal income tax rate of minus 6.7% on $160 billion of profit from 2008 through 2010 compared to a going corporate tax rate of 35%. All but one of those 30 companies reported lobbying expenses in Washington. Another report, by Public Campaign, <a href="http://link.reuters.com/zef65s">shows that 29 of those companies spent nearly half a billion dollars</a> over those three years lobbying in Washington for laws and rules that favor their interests. &#8230; The report – “For Hire: Lobbyists or the 99 percent” – says that while shedding jobs, the 30 companies are “spending millions of dollars on Washington lobbyists to stave off higher taxes or regulations.”<br />….<br />Company reports to shareholders show that among the 30 companies in the Public Campaign report, the 10 firms that spent the most on lobbying during the same three-year period fired more than 93,000 American workers. &#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p> So we thought we had finally created a national system of health insurance that would permit near-universal coverage for essential health benefits to every American. </p>
<p>But the Obama administration says it is not going to write rules regulating exactly what benefits must be covered.  Again bowing his head to the GOP personal responsibility/states&#8217; rights mantras, the president is willing to let states &#8220;experiment&#8221; like they do with Medicaid.  Question whether this amounts to allowing right-wing states to shift benefits to private profits and away from care for Americans?<br />This goes back to the recommendation from a panel at The National Academic of Sciences, which said that the federal government should take cost into consideration in deciding what&#8217;s essential to be provided by health insurance plans under the reform act and that new benefits should be &#8216;offset&#8217; by cost cutting elsewhere. Robert Pear, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/us/politics/panel-says-us-should-weigh-cost-in-health-coverage.html">Panel Says U.S. Should Weigh Cost in Deciding &#8216;Essential Health Benefits'&#8221;</a>, New York Times, Oct. 7, 2011, A14.<br />  <br />But a primary problem with cost-benefit analysis as typically understood is that it favors the status quo because any new benefit for which money must be expended will cost compared to the current system, and the benefit is much harder to turn into a quantitative number that will prove that the cost is worth it.  It is very hard to do truly &#8216;dynamic&#8217; cost-benefit analysis&#8211;the assumptions used tend to be a one-size-fits-all and it is hard to calculate the way that the immediate benefit builds even more substantial long-term benefits and then result in much lower costs down the road,</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>so that current costs that will have substantial long-term benefits that may not add up to significant numbers until years or decades have passed will tend to be viewed as negatives, whereas maintaining a terribly ineffective and unjust status quo will be seen as positive.  Even more killing for any cost-benefit analysis of medical reform where part of the reason for the problem is the exorbitant pricing that creates large profits for doctors and for-profit hospitals is that If &#8216;costs&#8217; take into account the fact that decent health care modeling should reduce the highest end medical provider incomes (like the excessive profits made by private nursing homes and hospitals and surgeons who do not work on salary, etc.), then of course the cost-benefit analysis will favor the status quo where those that have money get good care and those that don&#8217;t die.</p>
<p>One of the ways that the failure to adopt at least a public option or ideally a single (national) payer option for health care reform shows is that the panel suggested that the minimum coverage required should conform to what small employers provide&#8211;typically much less generous coverage than that provided by large employers.  As the October New York Times article on this noted, &#8220;This reading of the law was unexpected, but the panel said it was justified because small businesses &#8216;will be among the main customers for policies in the state-based exchanges.'&#8221;  Id.  Not surprisingly, the article also concludes that &#8220;the recommendation is likely to please employers and insurance companies and could cause concern among some advocates for consumers and patients with particular illnesses who want more expansive benefits.&#8221;  Id.  Again&#8211;just more evidence that the right option for health reform is an extension of Medicare for all, not this piece-meal attempt to appease health insurers and health providers by attempting to guarantee that they can still reap huge profits out of what should be a universally provided public good.</p>

<p> By Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus (hat tip to <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/12/10-tuesday-pm-reads-13/" target="_blank">Barry Ritholtz</a>)<br />
<blockquote>Since the high-profile <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/solyndra-energy-department-failed-to-sound-alarm-as-solar-company-sank/2011/11/04/gIQAGQgfBN_story.html">bankruptcy of Solyndra</a>, the solar company that received $535 million in federal loan guarantees, many have concluded that government efforts to promote energy technologies are doomed to fail. Critics cite the abandoned synthetic fuels program, attempts to capture carbon pollution from coal plants and next-generation nuclear reactors as further proof of this conclusion.<br />Many often point to the shale gas revolution as evidence that the private sector, in response to market forces, is better than government bureaucrats at picking technological winners. It’s a compelling story, one that pits inventive entrepreneurs against slow-moving technocrats and self-dealing politicians.<br />The problem is, it isn’t true.<br />…..<br />While details vary, the story is basically the same for nuclear power, natural gas turbines, solar panels, and wind turbines — pretty much every significant energy technology since World War II. That’s because the private sector alone cannot sustain the kind of long-term investments necessary for big technological breakthroughs in the midst of volatile energy markets and short-term pressure to produce profits.<br />No doubt, government energy innovation investments could be made more efficiently and effectively. But it would be a mistake to imagine that we’d be better off without them. </p></blockquote>

<p>The Broad Sovereign Downgrade</p>
<p>  Recently I’ve spent time thinking about global bond investors, especially those conservative investors that stick with the high-quality sovereigns. I’ve got news for them: the share of high-quality investment grade sovereigns – BBB- and above is investment grade &#8211; is shrinking. Some bullet points comparing ratings in December 2007 to December 2011:
<ul>
<li>From a sample of 76 emerging market (EM) and developed market (DM) economies, 23 sovereigns have been upgraded by S&#038;P (I use S&#038;P specifically, but the agencies usually move in lockstep at a lag). These upgrades span both EM and DM markets, but EM dominated with 19 upgrades overall.. </li>
<li>The number of high-quality investment grade sovereigns – A- and above – fell by 6. </li>
<li>The AAA universe shrank by 2 economies – more is to come with imminent downgrades in Europe.</li>
</ul>

<p>  Madoff and Mankiw and Inequality&#8211;the corporatist ideology at work</p>
<p>There are two letters to the editor in the Times today that are worth noting&#8211;as usual, the &#8216;real&#8217; analysis is hidden in the interior pages, positioned next to a huge ad (for an investment adviser, no less).<br />Chris Cannon from San Francisco notes that treating Madoff as the iconic symbol of the financial disruption caused by the credit bubble is problematic. <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Everyone agrees that Mr. Madoff broke the rules.  But the damage done by those acting as allowed by our ineffective rules cost the public much more.  &#8216;Our troubled financial times&#8217; are the product of a bubble economy fueled by cheap money, an abject failure by rating agencies, regulatory agencies that have been hamstrung by regulations written by financial lobbyists, and a laserlike focus by some bank leaders on yearly bonuses.&#8221;  Letters, New York Times, Dec. 18, 2011, at BU 7.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steven Conn, Yellow Springs Ohio, notes that Greg Mankiw (economic adviser to Republicans, and specifically to Mitt Romney) misses the boat on understanding the way that economics is burdened with ideology. <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;He seems not to understand that economists aren&#8217;t really objective and dispassionate scientists.  Economics is merely a set of tools with which we build the kind of society we want to live in.  Defining what that means is, of course, an ideological proposition, and thus all economic &#8216;theory&#8217; is freighted with ideological baggage.&#8221;  Letters, New York Times, Dec. 18, 2011, at BU 7.</p></blockquote>
<p>These two ideas are related.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p> One of the reasons that someone like Madoff could get away with a long-term, enormous economic scam is that the reigning economic ideology from 1980 to 2010 has been the neoliberal belief in unfettered markets, taking power with &#8216;reaganomics&#8217; and the acceptance of &#8216;greed is good&#8217; corporatism that took hold in 1980, in which those that are sleazy, fraudulent or just intent on having things work out a certain way can take enormous means to achieve their petty ends&#8211;like hiring just-out-of-Congress people to panhandle for them in the halls of Congress and to hobnob with regulators, drafting the rules that govern the industry.  It is the enormous expansion of this corporatist perspective that permits money to buy the rules that caused the financial crisis and that continues to pervade the policy solutions that can get through a Congress that is behoven to lobbyists and Big Money in various industries. <br />As long as we leave tax policy fundamentally to the corporatist moneybags and ideological economists, we can expect regulations to fall short of what they ought to do to protect ordinary Americans; corporations to make money out of failing to do what they ought to do to protect their workers, their customers, and their communities; tax laws that fail to exact a reasonable share of the fiscal burden from the very wealthy (such as the current trend towards decimation of the estate tax, often the only way that some extraordinarily wealthy families pay much of anything, because most of their income is in the favored form of capital gains and income on capital); and the passage of stupid laws that take away our most precious Constitutional rights&#8211;like the legislation under consideration that will permit the MILITARY TO DETAIN US CITIZENS WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. <br />And the result of these tax and economic policies will be a continuation of the trend towards a two-class society of the very rich and the rest of us that has been aided and abetted by reaganomics.  See Allegretto, <a href="http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2011/12/05/the-few-the-proud-the-very-rich/">the few, the proud, and the very rich</a>, Berkeley Blog, Dec. 2011.<br />
<blockquote>The share of wealth held by the top fifth is about 87.2 percent while the bottom four-fifths share the remaining 12.8 percent of wealth—so the <em>Occupiers </em>are correct in their assessment. And, the riches of those in the top 1 percent are about 225 times greater than that held by the typical family—it was 125 times in 1962—so, Grandma was correct too.<br />***<br />In 2007 (the most recent SCF) the cumulative wealth of the Forbes 400 was $1.54 trillion or roughly the same amount of wealth held by the entire bottom fifty percent of American families&#8230;.Upon closer inspection, the Forbes list reveals that six Waltons—all children (one daughter-in-law) of Sam or James “Bud” Walton the founders of Wal-Mart—were on the list. The combined worth of the Walton six was $69.7 billion in 2007—which equated to the total wealth of the entire bottom thirty percent!  Id.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>A much-cited paper</strong> by Stanford’s Anat Admati and colleagues &#8212; “Fallacies, Irrelevant Facts, and Myths in the Discussion of Capital Regulation: Why Bank Equity Is Not Expensive” &#8212; should have ended this debate once and for all. It <strong>dismantles the banks’ position step by painstaking step.</strong></p>
<p>The study makes <strong>the crucial distinction between the interests of bank managers, bank shareholders and the public at large</strong>. Managers are being disingenuous. They do have reasons, valid after a fashion, for opposing higher capital requirements, just not reasons they can admit. The one they emphasize &#8212; cost of funding and its effect on future lending &#8212; is fit for public use, but bogus.</p>
<p>What might their real reasons be? If banks sell more shares, it’s true that the <strong>return on equity will fall. If managers’ pay is tied to return on equity (as it often is), they will be worse off. Shareholders, on the other hand, shouldn’t mind, because the risk of their investment is reduced in proportion</strong>. Taxpayers, of course, would be better off &#8212; <strong>less likely to be stuck at some point with the cost of bailing out the bank.</strong> </p></blockquote>

<p>While everyone hyperventilates about government debt, they don&#8217;t seem to be aware of the massively greater load of private debt, and its spectacular runup compared to government debt:</p>
<p><img alt="" height="393" src="http://cdn.debtdeflation.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/121911_0526_Movementatt5.png" title="private vs govt" width="467"></p>
<p>This from Steve Keen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2011/12/19/movement-at-the-station-canadian-central-bank-governor-carney-on-the-age-of-deleveraging/">latest</a>. (It&#8217;s not very long. There are lots of pictures. It makes every kind of sense. Read the whole thing.) The blue line is publicly held debt &#8212; not including money the government owes itself (on the consolidated budget) for Social Security and Medicare.*† The red line is debt of 1. households and nonprofits, 2. nonfinancial businesses, and 3. financial businesses.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how those sectors break out:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><img alt="" height="393" src="http://cdn.debtdeflation.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/121911_0526_Movementatt7.png" title="debt by sector" width="467"></p>
<p>Again, you hear all sorts of hyperventilating from the morality-based school of economics about households/consumers going on a debt-financed spending binge, especially in the 00s. And that definitely happened. With the financial industry begging them to borrow &#8212; almost literally throwing money at them &#8212; and telling them authoritatively that it&#8217;s free because house prices always go up, it&#8217;s not surprising. Humans will be humans; who&#8217;s gonna turn down money when the powers that be &#8212; who presumably know a lot more about finance than a high-school-educated homeowner working at a lumber mill &#8212; say it&#8217;s free?</p>
<p>But that ignores the really massive runup: financial corporations&#8217; debts. Starting at a little over 10% of GDP in 1970, they hit almost 80% by 2000, and when the crash hit they were over 120% of GDP &#8212; a 10x, order-of-magnitude increase over 40 years.</p>
<p>The story explaining these pictures was told long ago &#8212; notably by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Fisher#Debt-Deflation">Irving Fisher</a> in 1933 (<em>only</em> after he had driven his Wall Street firm to ruin and lost everything, including his house, by clinging, Polyanna-like, to the kindergarten-ish Price-Is-Right! nostrums of classical economics). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyman_Minsky#Understanding_Minsky.27s_financial_instability_hypothesis">Minsky</a> told it in cogent and convincing detail.</p>
<p>The basic story is very simple. It goes like this (in my words):
<div>• Banks (and shadow banks) make money by lending. <em>Bankers</em> have every incentive to increase their loan books, even by extending questionable loans, because bankers don&#8217;t personally bear the eventual, down-the-road losses from loan defaults &#8212; they&#8217;ve gotten their money already.</div>
<div></div>
<div>• When banks run out of real, productive enterprises to lend to &#8212; enterprises that can pay back loans and interest from the production and sale of real goods that humans can consume &#8212; they start lending to speculators (gamblers) who are buying financial assets in hopes that their prices will rise.</div>
<div></div>
<div>• That lending &#8212; extra money being pumped into the system &#8212; does indeed drive up the price of financial assets, far beyond the value of the real assets that (according to most economists you listen to) supposedly underpin those financial assets&#8217; value.</div>
<div></div>
<div>• Eventually people realize that the value of financial assets far exceeds the value of real assets &#8212; and far exceeds the capacity of the real economy to service the loans that drove up those financial asset prices. Prices of financial assets plummet, borrowers default because there just ain&#8217;t enough real income to service the loans, financial-asset prices plummet some more, all in a downward spiral &#8212; with all sorts of collateral damage to the real economy.</div>
<p><i>There&#8217;s</i> your (economy-wide) Ponzi scheme. Households and nonfinancial businesses definitely participate (the financial industry makes it almost irresistible not to), but it&#8217;s driven by the financial industry, and a huge proportion of the takings go to players in the financial industry.</p>
<p>But as Keen points out, the powers that be almost completely ignore that simple story. He quotes one of Bernanke&#8217;s extraordinarily rare mentions of either Fisher or Minsky:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fisher’s idea was less influential in academic circles, though, <strong><em>because of the counterargument that debt-deflation represented no more than a redistribution from one group (debtors) to another (creditors)</em></strong>. Absent implausibly large differences in marginal spending propensities among the groups, it was suggested, pure redistributions should have no significant macro-economic effects… (Bernanke 2000, p. 24; emphasis added)</p></blockquote>
<p>The rarity &#8212; inexplicable to me, at least &#8212; speaks even more loudly and eloquently than this blithely dismissive quotation does.</p>
<p>When really smart people like Ben Bernanke constantly ignore an elegant, simple, even obvious explanation that&#8217;s been lying on the ground, ready to pick up, for at least 75 years, you gotta figure they&#8217;ve got some incentive &#8212; whether they&#8217;re conscious of it or not. That&#8217;s what I talked about <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/12/250-billion-reasons-why-fed-hates.html">the other day</a>.</p>
<p>Again, read Steve&#8217;s <a href="http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2011/12/19/movement-at-the-station-canadian-central-bank-governor-carney-on-the-age-of-deleveraging/">whole piece</a>. And if you have any interest in economics and haven&#8217;t bought the new edition of his book yet, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WBg4YgEACAAJ&#038;dq=debunking+economics&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=0MfwTtenHcibiQKknp3ADg&#038;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ">do</a>.</p>
<p>* Please <em>don&#8217;t</em> try to dismiss this by pointing to the net present value of SS/Medicare liabilities extending into the infinite future. 1. Including those intra-government debts doesn&#8217;t change this picture much at all. 2. It&#8217;s a completely separate discussion, about whether we choose to provide those services out of current GDP over future years and decades. 3. If charges by health-care providers were rising at the same rate as inflation, even that future cost would not be a terrible burden. 4. Social Security is actuarily solid <i>on a cash-flow basis </i>for decades, and beyond the foreseeable future (75 years+) if we simply Scrap The Cap on the payroll tax, requiring high earners to pay their full share.</p>
<p>† I&#8217;m not clear whether he includes bonds held by the Fed &#8212; again, money the government owes itself, if you view Treasury and Fed as both being part of the government &#8212; which total a whopping $1.6 trillion or so, more than 10% of GDP, last I checked. I don&#8217;t actually know if Fed holdings are included in &#8220;debt held by the  public.&#8221; (You gotta wonder whether the Fed counts as &#8220;the public.&#8221;) Little help, so I don&#8217;t have to go Google it up myself?</p>

<p>A Modest Forecast:  The Average Real Growth in Ireland will Exceed 10% a Year From 2012 to 2014</p>
<p> You read the title correctly:  the Irish economy will grow by more than 10% next year.  Now, hearing that, you might be asking yourself:  &#8220;Is this guy for real?  He must be nuts.&#8221;</p>
<p> Because I&#8217;ve looked around and nobody is predicting that sort of growth for Ireland for the next few years.   So let me lay out ten facts that should make it obvious to just about everyone:</p>
<p>1.  According to the <a href="http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/saveselections.asp">Central Statistics Office</a> of Ireland, real GDP (measured in 2009 Euros) peaked at 45,583 million Euros in the fourth quarter of 2007.  It bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2010 at 39,403 million Euros.  That is, real GDP fell by 13.5%.  Since then, GDP has barely budged.  So its safe to call 2011, four years after the peak, as a year when the bottom out process was ongoing.</p>
<p>2.  According to the OECD, <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/18/2506453.xls">Ireland&#8217;s all in top marginal tax rates are about 52.1%</a>.</p>
<p>3.  According to the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">BEA</a>, real GDP (measured in 2005 dollars) was 976.1 billion in 1929. It reached a nadir of 715.8 billion in 1933, amounting to a drop of 26.6%.  Note that while growth was negative in 1933 (four years after the peak), it was just a small drop.  The bulk of the decrease occurred from 1929 to 1932.   </p>
<p>4.  According to the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a>, the top Federal marginal tax rate was 63% in 1934, and it rose to 79% in 1936.  Note that this wasn&#8217;t an &#8220;all in&#8221; rate.</p>
<p>5.  According to the BEA, <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls">real economic growth in the US</a> in 1934, 1935 and 1936 was 10.9%, 8.9% and 13.1%.  The annualized rate of growth from 1933 to 1938, years which I&#8217;m cherry-picking to show some relatively poor growth, was 6.7% a year.   <br /><a name="more"></a>6.  FDR instituted a number of large scale programs.  For instance, <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/wpa/wpa_info.html">[b]y March, 1936, the WPA rolls had reached a total of more than 3,400,000 persons</a>.  For comparison,  according to the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=9&#038;step=1">NIPA Table 7.1</a>, the entire population of the US in 1936 was 128.181 million.  Thus, 2.7% of the US population was employed in the WPA alone.  Throw in the CCC, the Rural Electrification Administration, the TVA, and I think we can all agree that the Federal government was playing a big role in the economy.</p>
<p>7.  Many eminent worthies, too many to name, in fact tell us that the rapid growth in the economy from 1933 to 1940 was due to the bounce-back in the economy.  They also tell us that the economy would have recovered much more quickly if FDR had not followed socialist policies.</p>
<p>8.  Ireland doesn&#8217;t have as far to bounce back from as the US did in 1934, implying slower growth in Ireland today than in the US in 1934.</p>
<p> 9.  On the other hand, taxes are much lower in Ireland today than in the US in 1934, and nobody is accusing the Irish today of following socialist policies, implying faster economic growth in Ireland today than in the US in 1934.</p>
<p>10.  Facts 8 and 9 probably cancel each other out, leaving us to expect, on average, about the same growth rate in Ireland over the next few years as we saw in the US during the New Deal years when FDR ruined the economy.</p>
<p>As the eggheads say, QED.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s nice about this is that we will see rapid growth in other countries too.  Taxes are much lower in the US now then they were during the New Deal years, and for all the cries of socialism and whatnot, there is WPA or CCC or Rural Electrification Program.  Heck, even the Fed doesn&#8217;t seem to want to do anything about jobs and that&#8217;s part of its mandate.   Back to the eggheads for a moment.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a bunch of them who think the New Deal helped the economy, that lower taxes don&#8217;t generate faster economic growth or that its a good idea for the government go out and buy stuff to boost demand at times of economic weakness.  Boy are those folks about to be surprised by the magic of the free market and low taxes.    &#8212;  <a href="http://art-bin.com/art/omodest.html">Disclosure</a>: <br />

<blockquote>No it doesn’t. It almost never is. To pay back government debt, you have to run a budget surplus, and while there may be modest surpluses from time to time, they don’t add up to more than a minuscule fraction of all the accumulated debt. But don’t take it from me, look at the record.</p>

<p>Do you notice our progenitors&#8217; great-great-grandchildren (us) paying off our forebears&#8217; debts? Yeah, neither did I. (It did happen once, and the result was <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/does-reducing-the-federal-debt-cause-financial-collapse.html">economic catastrophe. Every depression in our nation&#8217;s history was preceded by a big decline in nominal Federal debt</a>.)</p>

<p>David Graeber, from <em>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reader will recall that the Bank of England was created when a consortium of forty London and Edinburgh merchants &#8212; mostly already creditors to the crown &#8212; offered King William III a £1.2 million loan to help finance his war against France.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>To this day, this loan has never been paid back. It cannot be. If it ever were, the entire monetary system of Great Britain would cease to exist.</p></blockquote>
<p>That loan was issued 317 years ago &#8212; in 1694.</p>
<p>Governments that issue their own money <em>don&#8217;t have to pay off their debts. </em>They actually can&#8217;t. In fact, they issue money &#8212; the money that&#8217;s necessary for a growing economy to operate &#8212; <em>by</em> deficit spending.</p>
<p>Private borrowers (and non-sovereign-currency states like Greece and Alabama) do have to pay off their debts (or default). That&#8217;s why the level of private debt, not sovereign debt, is the big management problem &#8212; a problem that neoclassical economics has not tackled, does not even have the theoretical apparatus to tackle.</p>
<p>Yes, of course: government debt and interest payments as a percentage of GDP are important issues. I&#8217;ll hand it back to Sandwichman:</p>
<blockquote><p>The debt burden depends on the ratio of debt to GDP as well as the interest cost in servicing it. The way to reduce this burden is to have a combination of real economic growth, inflation and modest interest rates. If you want to show your solicitude for the well-being of future generations, demand macroeconomic policies that will boost demand and raise inflation a bit, consistent with continued low interest rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today&#8217;s creditors will hate you. But your grandchildren will love you.</p>
<p>Update (thanks to Buffpilot for finding holes): A more precise explanation of why a sovereign-currency issuer might &#8220;have&#8221; to pay back their debt: if they have committed to redeem their money for something else. For instance Argentina (dollar-denominated debt) and whole host of others who were on a gold standard, had promised to give gold in return for their money. If they can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t do so, that&#8217;s a default on their promise. The U.S. and the U.K. (among others) do not face that situation.</p>
