                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Kind of an idle question. I read <a href="http://www.michaelyon-online.com/wp/three-marks-on-the-horizon.htm">Michael Yon&#8217;s latest dispatch</a> which says things are getting better in Iraq. I hope he&#8217;s right, but I remain skeptical. </p>
<p>I do wonder about something though&#8230; </p>
<blockquote><p>Our military has increasing moral authority in Iraq, but the same cannot be said for our government at home. In fact, it’s in moral deficit because many Iraqis are increasingly frightened we will abandon them to genocide. The Iraqis I speak with couldn’t care less what is said from Washington but large numbers of them pay close attention to what some Marine Gunny says, or what American battalion commanders all over Iraq say. Some of our commanders could probably run for local offices in Iraq, and win.</p></blockquote>
<p>And its a point Yon himself thinks is important&#8230; he ends his dispatch with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Large numbers of Iraqis detested us after the prisoner abuse stories, and some over-the-top attacks on Fallujah, for example. But through time, somehow the American military has managed to establish a moral authority in Iraq. It’s not the only authority, but the military has serious and increasing moral clout. In the beginning, our influence flowed from guns, or dropped from the wings of jets. Later it was the money. Today, the clout still is partially from the gun, and definitely the money is key, but there is an intangible and growing moral clout and it flows from an increasing respect among Iraqis for our military. Washington has no moral clout in Iraq. Washington looks like a circus act. The authority is coming from our military. The importance of this fact would be difficult to overstate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Assume he&#8217;s right. What does this mean for the future of Iraq? To me, it either means the US military must remain there for a very, very long time or there must be some way to transfer that moral authority to some Iraqi institution. If an Iraqi institution is capable of, shall we say, absorbing through osmosis some of that moral authority the US military has developed, presumably it would be the military and/or police. Leaving aside questions of how, um, ethnically cleansed branches of the military and/or police happen to be at this time, is it a healthy thing for the moral authority of the country to be invested in the military and/or police?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about Turkey, but what I&#8217;ve read seems to indicate that the military does enjoy a reputation as being the most honest institution in the country. (Is that true? Am I way off-base here?) Are there other examples where this is true? And is it a good thing in the long term? What is the best case scenario for what Iraq will look like in ten years? Twenty?</p>

                                <p><a title="http://money.aol.com/news/articles/_a/china-seeks-to-dampen-us-dollar-rumors/n20070812031609990020#cmntbgn">Aol money reports</a> that China has reassured the US it is a firm holder of US treasuries.</p>
<blockquote><p>China is a responsible investor in international financial markets, and our country&#8217;s foreign exchange reserves are managed with the operational goals of safety, liquidity and profit,&#8221; Xinhua quoted the central bank official as saying. The People&#8217;s Bank does not disclose the composition of the foreign exchange reserves, which have swelled in recent years as China&#8217;s exports surged and investors poured money into the country to profit from an economy now in its fourth straight year of double-digit growth. But the reserves have become a political issue both within China and between Beijing and Washington. As the dollar has fallen in value, the People&#8217;s Bank has come under pressure to diversify its holdings to maintain the value of the reserves and improve returns.</p>
<p><a title="http://money.aol.com/news/articles/_a/china-eases-foreign-exchange-controls/n20070814014109990001">Aol money also reports</a>:</p>
<p>China has scrapped rules that required local companies to convert a portion of their foreign earnings into Chinese currency, the government said Tuesday, in a move that could ease pressure on Beijing&#8217;s foreign exchange system. Companies now will be allowed to decide on their own how to use money earned abroad, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said on its Web site. Previous rules requiring companies to convert at least 20 percent of foreign earnings into Chinese yuan boosted demand for the currency, increasing pressure for it to rise against the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies.</p>
<p>The latest change could help to slow the growth of China&#8217;s $1.3 trillion foreign reserves accumulated by the central bank as it tries to curb pressure for prices to rise by draining money from the economy through bond sales. &#8220;This policy revision is an important reform in foreign exchange management,&#8221; the agency said on its Web site. &#8220;The implementation of the new policy will improve the autonomy and convenience of domestic companies, strengthen companies&#8217; capital management and improve the international balance of payments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until 2002, Chinese companies were required to bring home all the money they made abroad and obtain government permission to make new foreign investments. Beginning in 2002, companies were allowed to keep 20 percent of foreign revenues. That was raised to 50 percent in 2004 and 80 percent the following year.</p>

<p>Is this a quiet move to loosen reliance on US treasuries? What else does it accomplish?</p>

<p>Could I ask one favor from <a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-commerce/2007/8/10/federal-reserve-stands-pat-as-stock-market-burns.html#read_more">James Pethokoukis</a> &#8211; stop emailing me stupid stuff like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>For a more upbeat take, here is another of my favorite guys, Don Luskin of TrendMacrolytics:</p>
<p><em>The price of risk in credit markets has returned to normal levels, but for those who gorged for years on a zero price of risk, it feels like whiplash.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It’s bad enough that you cite the Stupid Man Alive on any economic issue.  When Luskin says “the price of risk” is zero, what is he babbling about?  If he is defining risk as diversifiable risk, he has finally discovered the Arbitrage Pricing Theorem.  Or is he saying the price of systematic risk is zero?  If that were the case, the expected return to stocks would equal the risk-free rate.   So much for his free lunch solution to the alleged Social Security crisis that he keeps babbling about.  No – I suspect he is referring to the price of credit risk, which in an efficient market would represent the expected losses from possible defaults on credit.  </p>
<p>So what is a normal level for something like a credit spread and has this spread been zero recently?  Well, let’s look at the difference between interest rates on BBB rated corporate bonds and the ten-year Federal bond rate as a proxy for this idea (if Luskin has a better measure, it’s a shame he failed to mention it).  It would seem that this credit spread has not been zero for the past several years.  In fact, it was higher in 2002 and 2003 than it is today.  So when Donald Luskin claims people have “gorged for years on a zero price of risk” – he has no idea what he is talking about.  And neither does James Pethokoukis.  Yet – Pethokoukis relies on Donald Luskin as some alleged subject matter expert.  Dumb and dumber!</p>

                                <p>This post is on men’s income, women’s income, and how the two compare, using data from <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p05ar.html">the Census</a> which goes back to 1953.  FWIW, I think this is something Dems care about more than Reps.  The comparison between males and females is not perfect… they may work different hours, and on different jobs.  Still, its an interesting look at how society has evolved over time.  As is my usual practice, I’m going to look at things by Presidential administration.  Does the President have much to do with?  Well, some.  The President is in charge of the Justice Department, and the Justice Department, in theory, looks into discrimination, and even can file suit if it deems necessary.  Presidents also nominate judges who may look more or less favorable at such issues.  </p>

<p>Since 1953, real median income for females has grown faster (1.83% per year) than real income for males has grown (0.87%) … thus narrowing the gap.  Not a surprise… women were virtually second class citizens in 1953.  </p>
<p>What else do we see…  real median incomes for men fared best under JFK/LBJ, Ike and Clinton, with the Bush boys bringing up the rear.  (That last part of the sentence seems to be true a lot in this series of posts, doesn’t it?)  Female median income fared best under JFK/LBJ, Reagan, and Clinton with GW and Ike at the back of the pack.   But the President who did “best” at income equality was GHW… mostly because he was in the middle of the pack for female real median income growth, while male real median income growth in his administration cratered.  JFK/LBJ, under whom both genders fared the best, falls in the middle of the pack when it comes to gender income inequality.  It seems a pretty perverse result, frankly.  Maybe this ratio is not such a good measure after all.  </p>
<p>For my next post in the series, I want to look at income in black and white, so to speak, and see if the same thing applies.</p>

                                <p>A reader who chooses to remain nameless sent me a link to this post at <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/174828">Tom Dispatch.com</a> looking at Iraq by the numbers.  I can&#8217;t really excerpt any bit of it &#8230;  its worth reading in its entirety.</p>
<p>And via <a href="http://sideshow.me.uk/saug07.htm#08131932">Avedon Carol</a>, a story at <a href="http://brilliantatbreakfast.blogspot.com/2007/08/blackout.html">Brilliant at Breakfast</a> about why recruitment is down among African Americans:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;In 2000, &#8220;Jackson reported, &#8220;23.5 percent of Army recruits were African-American.  By 2005, the percentage dropped to 13.9 percent.  National Public Radio this week quoted a Pentagon statistic that said African-American propensity to join the military had dropped to 9 percent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the phrasing of that quote is a bit off, but the conclusion is obvious:  you simply cannot trust black people to do what is right.  This dates back at least to the War of Yankee Aggression, where black people refused to stand up for States Rights like real (i.e., Southern and white) Americans even to defend their own status as three-fifths of a human being with none of the rights, which was really the only Right the States really cared about.  And now, on aggregate their behavior is equally shameful.  Given that most black people are poorer than average, it is their duty to put themselves in danger in a war whose rationale keeps shifting if only to ensure that the College Republicans can stay here and &#8220;fight the war of ideas&#8221;  (which from what I can tell means to convince the rest of us we should be out fighting in Iraq because a bunch of illiterates in Pakistan think they can make the world into caliphate or something).</p>

<blockquote><p>In study after study and in country after country, men report more, often many more, sexual partners than women.  One survey, recently reported by the federal government, concluded that men had a median of seven female sex partners. Women had a median of four male sex partners. Another study, by British researchers, stated that men had 12.7 heterosexual partners in their lifetimes and women had 6.5.<br />But there is just one problem, mathematicians say. It is logically impossible for heterosexual men to have more partners on average than heterosexual women. Those survey results cannot be correct. It is about time for mathematicians to set the record straight, said David Gale, an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. “Surveys and studies to the contrary notwithstanding, the conclusion that men have substantially more sex partners than women is not and cannot be true for purely logical reasons,” Dr. Gale said. He even provided a proof, writing in an e-mail message:</p>
<p>“By way of dramatization, we change the context slightly and will prove what will be called the High School Prom Theorem. We suppose that on the day after the prom, each girl is asked to give the number of boys she danced with. These numbers are then added up giving a number G. The same information is then obtained from the boys, giving a number B. </p>
<p>Theorem: G=B</p>
<p>Proof: Both G and B are equal to C, the number of couples who danced together at the prom. Q.E.D.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ll return to Brad who spotted a major error but let’s finish with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>One is that men are going outside the population to find partners, to prostitutes, for example, who are not part of the survey, or are having sex when they travel to other countries. Another, of course, is that men exaggerate the number of partners they have and women underestimate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this an estimation problem or is it as Brad notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our own David Gale from the tenth floor is made to look ridiculous by Gina Kolata &#8211; you see, she didn&#8217;t tell him that the survey didn&#8217;t ask about means &#8211; about averages = but about medians. Which means that she doesn&#8217;t know the difference between means and medians.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s speculate a bit.  Suppose these sample medians do capture the population medians.  That means about the half the men have 13 partners or more.  I doubt many of them have more than 15 or 20.  About half the men have 12 partners or less and some might have had only one partner in life.  Or even none.  So B’s mean is likely less than B’s median.  Now ladies – excuse me for this – but Ms. Kolata did raise the issue of prostitutes – as in a few women have lots and lots of partners, which would suggest the G’s mean exceeds its median.  </p>
<p>Now for you loyal husbands who could care less about this, hug your wife and tell you how terrific she is.  Even if both of you are “below average” by one silly measure.</p>

                                <p>Just in case you missed the tirade launched by Jim Cramer on the Federal Reserve, <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/08/the_mashup_youve_been_waiting.php">Matt Yglesias</a> brings us a humorous play on it.  Poor Jim, his speculative plays will not be bailed out by the FED.  But <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTU5ZmZkZWNkZTU2NTUwMjhhNGYwYjQyZjYyMDFmY2Q=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> is hoping Main Street will bail out Wall Street:</p>
<blockquote><p>Main Street was focused on the real economics of our nation. To this day, the American labor force is going to work, running the millions of small owner-operated companies that provide the wellspring of our prosperity. And Main Street is benefiting from an unprecedented global boom that is stocking our stores with affordable goods and creating plentiful new jobs as U.S. firms service the rise of new export markets. With a record 146 million men and women working, and the unemployment rate at a historically low 4.6 percent, the American labor force has increased its after-tax real income by a whopping $257 billion. Nominal wages for non-supervisory workers alone have sprouted by $296 billion over the past year, according to Wall Street economist David Malpass. Average compensation per hour has grown 5.2 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where to begin with Kudlow’s incessant stupidity?  Real wages for non-supervisory workers as of June 2007 were at the same level they were as of December 2002.  The employment to population ratio has declined from its 64.4 percent as of December 2006 to 64.0 percent.  The labor market is not quite as strong as Kudlow would have you believe.  </p>
<p>And I’m sure you are wondering about his claim that we are enjoying some sort of export boom.  If one compares the export to GDP ratio for 2007QII, which was 11.58 percent, to this ratio for 2000QIV, which was 11.21 percent – it does turn out that export growth has been slightly greater than GDP growth.  But average real GDP growth has been rather anemic over the past six and a half years.  Kudlow omits the fact that the import/GDP ratio has risen from 15.27 percent as of 2000QIV to 16.83 percent as of 2007QII.  To suggest that the U.S. is enjoying a net export boom, which is creating a lot of new jobs, is simply dishonest.  But hey – that’s Kudlow’s job: lie to the readers of the National Review.</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant Clay Hanna looks sick and white. Like his colleagues he does not seem to sleep. Hanna says he catches up by napping on a cot between operations in the command centre, amid the noise of radio. He is up at 6am and tries to go to sleep by 2am or 3am. But there are operations to go on, planning to be done and after-action reports that need to be written. And war interposes its own deadly agenda that requires his attention and wakes him up.<br />When he emerges from his naps there is something old and paper-thin about his skin, something sketchy about his movements as the days go by.</p>
<p>The Americans he commands, like the other men at Sullivan &#8211; a combat outpost in Zafraniya, south east Baghdad &#8211; hit their cots when they get in from operations. But even when they wake up there is something tired and groggy about them. They are on duty for five days at a time and off for two days. When they get back to the forward operating base, they do their laundry and sleep and count the days until they will get home. It is an exhaustion that accumulates over the patrols and the rotations, over the multiple deployments, until it all joins up, wiping out any memory of leave or time at home. Until life is nothing but Iraq.</p>
<p>Hanna and his men are not alone in being tired most of the time. A whole army is exhausted and worn out. You see the young soldiers washed up like driftwood at Baghdad&#8217;s international airport, waiting to go on leave or returning to their units, sleeping on their body armour on floors and in the dust.</p>
<p>Where once the war in Iraq was defined in conversations with these men by untenable ideas &#8211; bringing democracy or defeating al-Qaeda &#8211; these days the war in Iraq is defined by different ways of expressing the idea of being weary. It is a theme that is endlessly reiterated as you travel around Iraq. &#8216;The army is worn out. We are just keeping people in theatre who are exhausted,&#8217; says a soldier working for the US army public affairs office who is supposed to be telling me how well things have been going since the &#8216;surge&#8217; in Baghdad began.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>They are not supposed to talk like this. We are driving and another of the public affairs team adds bitterly: &#8216;We should just be allowed to tell the media what is happening here. Let them know that people are worn out. So that their families know back home. But it&#8217;s like we&#8217;ve become no more than numbers now.&#8217;</p>
<p>The first soldier starts in again. &#8216;My husband was injured here. He hit an improvised explosive device. He already had a spinal injury. The blast shook out the plates. He&#8217;s home now and has serious issues adapting. But I&#8217;m not allowed to go back home to see him. If I wanted to see him I&#8217;d have to take leave time (two weeks). And the army counts it.&#8217;</p>
<p>A week later, in the northern city of Mosul, an officer talks privately. &#8216;We&#8217;re plodding through this,&#8217; he says after another patrol and another ambush in the city centre. &#8216;I don&#8217;t know how much more plodding we&#8217;ve got left in us.&#8217;</p>
<p>When the soldiers talk like this there is resignation. There is a corrosive anger, too, that bubbles out, like the words pouring unbidden from a chaplain&#8217;s assistant who has come to bless a patrol. &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you tell the truth? Why don&#8217;t you journalists write that this army is exhausted?&#8217;</p>
<p>But the exhaustion of the US army emerges most powerfully in the details of these soldiers&#8217; frayed and worn-out lives. Everywhere you go you hear the same complaints: soldiers talk about divorces, or problems with the girlfriends that they don&#8217;t see, or about the children who have been born and who are growing up largely without them.</p>
<p>&#8216;I counted it the other day,&#8217; says a major whose partner is also a soldier. &#8216;We have been married for five years. We added up the days. Because of Iraq and Afghanistan we have been together for just seven months. Seven months &#8230; We are in a bad place. I don&#8217;t know whether this marriage can survive it.&#8217;</p>
<p>The anecdotal evidence on the ground confirms what others &#8211; prominent among them General Colin Powell, the former US Secretary of State &#8211; have been insisting for months now: that the US army is &#8216;about broken&#8217;. Only a third of the regular army&#8217;s brigades now qualify as combat-ready. Officers educated at the elite West Point academy are leaving at a rate not seen in 30 years, with the consequence that the US army has a shortfall of 3,000 commissioned officers &#8211; and the problem is expected to worsen.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>And it is not only the soldiers that are worn out. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have led to the destruction, or wearing out, of 40 per cent of the US army&#8217;s equipment, totalling at a recent count $212bn (£105bn).</p>
<p>But it is in the soldiers themselves &#8211; and in the ordinary stories they tell &#8211; that the exhaustion of the US military is most obvious, coming amid warnings that soldiers serving multiple Iraq deployments, now amounting to several years, are 50 per cent more likely than those with one tour to suffer from acute combat stress.</p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have said this is a different sort of war and was taking a much heavier toll on our troops than admitted by the powers that be. Fourth generation warfare demands re-thinking some of our priorities, especially by proponents of global conflict and defense who demand sacrifice. Especially before next April when desparation becomes the rule of the day.</p>
<p>Karl Rove gets to go home now to salvage his family from the long haul. And Mitt&#8217;s boys are hard at work in Iowa, keeping us safe from the Dems. My worry is for the citizens.</p>

                                <p>Colleges fail to curb nursing shortage<br />Too few teachers means half of applicants turned away</p>
<p>Karen Bouffard / The Detroit News</p>
<p>WYANDOTTE &#8212; A faculty shortage and lack of money have Michigan&#8217;s 53 nursing schools turning away half of their applicants, exacerbating a looming shortage that some fear could close operating rooms in the next few years.</p>
<p>Amid high unemployment and a drive to re-educate the state&#8217;s work force, nursing school applications in Michigan nearly doubled to 16,000 in the past three years. But roughly half are denied or put on waiting lists for up to two years, as state officials scramble to avoid a shortage of 18,000 nurses predicted by 2015.</p>
<p>The crunch has some sounding alarms about the quality of health care as baby boomers reach retirement.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re short 18,000, that&#8217;s an absolute crisis,&#8221; said Jeanette Klemczak, the state&#8217;s first chief nurse executive, appointed by Gov. Jennifer Granholm in 2004 to develop a plan to stop the shortage. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t have those nurses, we&#8217;re going be in a dire situation. We&#8217;ll find ourselves with closed operating rooms and less hospital beds available to patients. It will slow down the whole delivery of the health care process.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is nationwide, but the crunch is acute in Metro Detroit. Wayne County Community College has 933 students on waiting lists, while Oakland Community College turned away 300. At Henry Ford Community College, 7,000 students list nursing as majors but the school can only admit 340 per year……………………  [see www.detnews.com for the full article].</p>
<p>*          *          *          *          *          *</p>
<p>This problem has been obvious for more than a decade, but our (nationwide) university system, and especially our state-funded schools, are busy cranking out majors for which there are no jobs. This is a major resource allocation problem.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/08/rove-and-mythology.html">Andrew Samwick</a> greets the departure of Karl Rove with some frank discussions of Bush’s fiscal failures:</p>
<blockquote><p>Medicare Part D was a betrayal of conservatism. Conservatives are supposed to see fiscal responsibility as their friend, precisely because the need to pay for what the government does should constrain the overall size of that government. This Administration let go of fiscal responsibility early in its first term and has been undermined by its absence ever since. (With the current budget target, weak as it is, we are essentially in a pay-as-you-go situation, so it&#8217;s not quite so bad.)</p>
<p>The President&#8217;s attempt at Social Security reform was the first casualty. The reason to reform Social Security is its long-term fiscal imbalance. The President understood that, even if his rhetoric was at times hyperbolic or misleading. The President lost all credibility on using that as a motivation for reform when he decided that the short-term non-entitlement budget imbalances &#8220;don&#8217;t matter&#8221; and when he passed a Medicare expansion whose unfunded obligations were larger than those in Social Security. That was contradiction number one … </p>
<p>Contradiction number two came from the President&#8217;s statements that he wanted to &#8220;strengthen&#8221; the system. It is reasonable to believe that strengthening an entitlement program means putting more resources into it. There was no plan put forward by the Administration, even in the form of a trial balloon, that tried to strengthen the system with new resources. That doesn&#8217;t mean the proposals were bad ideas, but it does mean that the honest description of what his plans due is to pare back projected future spending so that it is balanced by projected future revenues. The President&#8217;s intentions here were both conservative and (to use Rove&#8217;s word) ambitious. They just weren&#8217;t presented coherently, and so they got nowhere.</p>
<p>This notion that the President&#8217;s legacy on matters of fiscal policy &#8211; which will be written by historians (and bloggers!) that Rove can&#8217;t spin &#8211; will be anything but a severe and harsh critique is what I consider the Myth of Rove.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Andrew did work for this Administration for a while, I sense he never drank the Kool Aid.  I hope more conservatives can speak up as to how this White House has utterly failed us on fiscal policy.</p>
