                                <p>In an effort to appear balanced on Global Warming, many journalists give disproportionate weight to pseudo-scientific arguments.  This ABC report on Global Warming gets it right:  <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2119971&#038;page=1">A Perfect Storm Descends on the Nation&#8217;s Capital</a><br />
<blockquote>&#8216;The President — as far as the extensive and repeated researches of this and many other professional journalists, as well as all scientists credible on [Global Warming], can find — is wrong on one crucial and no doubt explosive issue. When he said — as he also did a few weeks ago — that &#8220;There&#8217;s a debate over whether it&#8217;s manmade or naturally caused&#8221; &#8230; well, there really is no such debate.</p>
<p>At least none above what is proverbially called &#8220;the flat earth society level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not one scientist of any credibility on this subject has presented any evidence for some years now that counters the massive and repeated evidence — gathered over decades and come at in dozens of ways by all kinds of professional scientists around the world — that the burning of fossil fuels is raising the world&#8217;s average temperature.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>  <strong>Exactly.</strong>  </p>
<p>Meteorologist Dr. Jeff Masters answered readers&#8217; questions on the same subject a few days ago: <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=385&#038;tstamp=200606">The Climate Change Consensus</a>.  His entire response is worth reading &#8211; here is his conclusion:<br />
<blockquote>In summary, there is an overwhelming level of scientific consensus on human-caused climate change. &#8230; I would like to see the media sharply reduce their coverage of the contrary views of such think tanks as the Competitive Enterprise Institute, George C. Marshall Foundation, and scientists such as S. Fred Singer of SEPP. Getting one&#8217;s climate science information from these sources it similar to getting one&#8217;s news from a tabloid newspaper. Sure, some of the stories are true, but a lot of the material is of questionable quality, to say the least. The media should focus on getting their scientific information from leading scientists who regularly publish in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.</p></blockquote>
<p>  I&#8217;m not optimistic that any progress will be made on Global Warming until 2009, but accurate reporting is a step in the right direction.</p>

                                <p>An AB reader sent me a delightful email after reading <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/indiana-toll-road-efficiency-gains.html">this</a> and an article suggesting that Governor Daniels thinks Indiana voters are not that bright when it comes to economics.  <a href="http://southbendtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060625/Opinion05/606250606/-1/OPINION/CAT=Opinion05">William O’Rourke</a> writing for the <em>South Bend Tribune</em>:<br />
<blockquote>Now that the former Eli Lilly executive has put most of the state on Eastern Standard Time&#8217;s daylight-saving time (Eli Lilly time!), and Hoosier parents experience the fun of trying to put their children to bed while it&#8217;s still light out, Daniels gets to boast to the readers of The New York Times how he was able to privatize the Toll Road despite the misguided objections of more than half of his fellow citizens: &#8220;public sentiment&#8221; ran &#8220;almost two to one against the deal,&#8221; Daniels wrote. He goes on to say, &#8220;&#8230; the animosity in Indiana was as genuinely grassroots as it gets. Many Hoosiers convinced themselves either that our proposal borrowed from the future, or that it gave away a part of America to &#8216;foreigners.&#8217; But Mitch showed the benighted the way, while not taking too much offense at the mob&#8217;s obtuseness: &#8220;Their hearts were in the right place, but not their logic.&#8221; Daniels extols the wonders of privatization: &#8220;The economic case is ironclad: Indiana has scored a multibillion-dollar financial gain.&#8221; He does admit, humbly, that he should have done more to educate the uneducated: &#8220;As governor, I should have done much more than I did to walk Indiana through, in advance, both the business case and the realities of today&#8217;s global economic competition.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that I had concerns similar to these Indiana residents, is Mitch Daniels questioning my knowledge of economics as well?  William O’Rourke continues:<br />
<blockquote>But what is &#8220;ironclad&#8221; is that the Toll Road takeover is a triumph of ideology over economics. The money behind the Spanish-Australian consortium Cintra-Macquarie&#8217;s purchase came from some of the same capital sources as a lot of American capital: from workers&#8217; pension funds, in this case the Australians. But Daniels wouldn&#8217;t let the Indiana Public Employees Retirement Fund buy the Toll Road &#8211; however sound a deal it would be. It would still involve government and the people as owner if he had. Privatizers see profit, whereas the public sees taxes. Not raising the tolls on the Toll Road, as Daniels talks about in his op-ed piece, came about &#8220;because it was run by politicians, who are rarely businesslike and deathly afraid to annoy anyone.&#8221; Now, Daniels is certainly businesslike and not afraid to annoy people, so why didn&#8217;t he have the courage to present a sensible schedule of toll increases? Well, not because he is a politician, but because he is an evangelizer for privatization. As Daniels notes in his Times piece, &#8220;As clear as the business case was, politics intruded; in fact, Indiana very nearly tore up its equivalent of a Powerball check. &#8230;&#8221; It&#8217;s an apt comparison, echoing the casino capitalism Daniels is so proud of. Some make good bets, others make bad ones. The short term brings big money to Indiana, but not just to the state. As in the stock market era of irrational exuberance, those who are in on the IPO, the beginning of things, profit mightily. There are large transaction profits to be spread around to the financiers who arrange the deal, all friends of the governor, or soon-to-be friends of the governor. This sort of casino capitalism has winners and losers. And Daniels was certainly a winner in 2001 when he sold his $1.45 million in Indiana Power &#038; Light Company stock just before the stock tanked. The business case that is so ironclad is the same one that has seen the salaries of CEOs balloon so obscenely over the last decade. Many copy it. In fact, Daniels couldn&#8217;t have railroaded through the privatizing of the Toll Road if Chicago&#8217;s Mayor Richard Daley hadn&#8217;t sold off the Skyway to the same foreign capital consortium. If a toll road is a public good, an example of public wealth, the responsibility for it remains with the people. When public goods become the source of private wealth the nature of society changes. It&#8217;s a change Daniels desires. In the old days plutocrats like Andrew Carnegie used to give the public libraries, museums and other benefits; these days the transfer goes the other way: The rich sell what the people own for their personal benefit and that of their friends.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting – Mr. O’Rourke seemingly suggests that Governor Daniels is pulling a financial fraud on Indiana taxpayers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: I should say thank you to Patrick R. Sullivan aka <a href="http://flyunderthebridge.blogspot.com/2006/06/more-wailing-and-gnashing-of-teeth.html">Roland Patrick</a> for <a href="http://illinoisissues.uis.edu/features/2006june/public.html">this</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Daley secured a landmark $1.8 billion lease of the Chicago Skyway in late 2004, and now he&#8217;s considering handing control of Midway Airport over to private operators. Likewise, state officials soon could be presented with an offer to privatize the Illinois tollway they simply can&#8217;t refuse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some would argue these deals are based on efficiency gains where the private firms and taxpayers both win.  Others – like yours truly – wonder if they may be some political favoritism going on where taxpayer assets are being sold below their true value.  I know this is Daley the Junior but when a Republican is asked about political corruption in the Democratic Party, the name Richard Daley is always on the tips of their tongues.</p>

                                <p>The National Review is angry at the New York Times for revealing the story about the secret program that examines banking records of Americans and others in a vast international database.  But it would seem <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YjAzN2E4NmQyMjJkYWUxNjExZDQxMDhlZWIyNTQxOWM=">KLo</a> resorts to rehashing spin from <a href="http://www.scrappleface.com/?p=2284">Scrappleface </a>:<br />
<blockquote>A secret New York Times program for fighting ‘the war on the war on terror’ represents a “radical expansion of executive editor authority” according to a legal analyst who studied the parameters of the “intel sifting and sharing program” that the Times uses to disseminate U.S. national security information to international terror groups</p></blockquote>
<p>I thought the debate was about President Bush’s claim that his authority includes covertly examining bank records with no judicial or Congressional oversight so I checked Scrappleface’s <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060624/ap_on_go_pr_wh/presidential_authority">link</a>.  </p>
<p>Maybe I’m missing something about I saw no reference to a radical expansion of executive editor authority.  I did see these references to the Administration: <br />
<blockquote>A secret CIA-Treasury program to track financial records of millions of Americans is the latest installment in an expansion of executive authority in the name of fighting terrorism &#8230; Still, Bush&#8217;s war on terrorism is an open-ended one. Constitutional scholars suggest there are limits. &#8220;At some point, the Constitution can&#8217;t bear the kind of continued strains that are being imposed by the demands of the fight on terrorism,&#8221; said Harold J. Krent, dean and professor of law at Kent College of Law in Chicago., &#8220;What I am worried about is that there is a potential for amassing huge databases of individuals &#8211; linked by phone records, linked by financial records &#8211; that can be kept and used without any kind of real oversight. It&#8217;s frightening,&#8221; Krent said.</p></blockquote>
<p>KLo once again finds some rightwinger who flat out lied – and she repeats the lie.  Why am I not surprised?</p>

                                <p>I was listening the CNN TV coverage of Republicans rehashing their same old talking points when I read <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/06/24/iraq.main/index.html">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) &#8211; U.S. forces released a revered 70-year-old Sunni cleric on Saturday hours after detaining him, Iraqi officials said. rowds earlier gathered to denounce the early morning raid on the Tikrit home of Sheikh Jamal Abdul Karim al-Dabban, which was described as &#8220;outrageous&#8221; by a key political party. .S. forces told Iraqi authorities that bad intelligence led to the raid and detention of al-Dabban and two of his sons, officials from Salaheddin province said.</p>
<p>The officials told CNN that the U.S. military apologized to al-Dabban and to the provincial governor and the head of the provincial council. arlier the largest and most powerful Sunni Arab political party issued a statement attacking the raid in Tikrit, the hometown of Saddam Hussein, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Baghdad. The foolishness of U.S. troops has reached its limit,&#8221; the Iraqi Islamic Party said. These outrageous violations are only going to worsen the security situation in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hundreds of people responded to calls over mosque loudspeakers to gather in front of the governor&#8217;s office to protest the detention, said local official Sheikh Yahya Ibrahim al-Atwani, The Associated Press reported. fficials later told CNN that a banquet would be held at the Tikrit Grand Mosque on Saturday evening to celebrate the sheikh&#8217;s release.  Te deputy governor of Salaheddin province, Abdullah Hussein Ajbara, said earlier that the Salaheddin provincial council and other government institutions suspended work to protest the detention. He is against terrorism and sectarianism,&#8221; Ajbara said of al-Dabban, whom he described as a very revered, moderate senior leader of Iraq&#8217;s Sunni Muslim community. &#8220;There was no reason for U.S. forces to detain him.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Our soldiers have been put in an impossible position.  It’s is time to bring them home or at least redeploy them as John Murtha suggests.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/000974.php">Josh Marshall</a> provides the interview between John King of CNN and Vice President Cheney:<br />
<blockquote>They&#8217;ve stood up a brand new government under a new constitution for the first time ever. We&#8217;ve got a quarter of a million Iraqis now in uniform, equipped, trained, in the fight.</p></blockquote>
<p>President Bush’s mantra has been that when they stand up, we stand down.  Cheney says the Iraqis have stood up – but he criticizes Senate Democrats who call for us to stand down.  This White House contradicts itself – again!</p>
<p>But here is where the Republicans have it all backwards:<br />
<blockquote>You got to remember that the Osama bin Laden types, the al Qaeda types, the Zarqawi types that have been active in Iraq are betting that ultimately they can break the United States&#8217; will. There&#8217;s no way they can defeat us militarily. But their whole strategy &#8212; if you look at what bin Laden has been saying for 10 years &#8212; is they believe they can, in fact, force us to quit, that ultimately we&#8217;ll get tired of the fight, that we don&#8217;t have the stomach for a long, tough battle, and that we&#8217;ll pack it in and go home. If we were to do that, it would be devastating from the standpoint of the global war on terror. It would affect what happens in Afghanistan. </p></blockquote>
<p>Had we finished the Delenda plan in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda would have been crushed.  But Bush and Cheney decided to divert resources to Iraq.  Of course, Osama bin Laden had no backup plan once his 9/11 strategy failed to deliver the intended results – as <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/_/2006/06/whos_winning_the_great_war_on_terror.php">James Wimberley</a> ably explains:<br />
<blockquote>I found the half-baked rhetoric of the preamble at least as interesting, for it shows the depths of confusion into which US policy has fallen; and, by the same token, the extent of Osama bin Laden&#8217;s strategic victory. He started from a very difficult position. Most jihadi Muslims, including the Taliban, Chechen autonomists, Hamas, and al-Zarqawi follow the fairly realistic &#8220;near enemy&#8221; strategy aimed at &#8220;liberating&#8221; Muslim majority populations into the delights of fundamentalist rule. He leads a small minority group of jihadis espousing an apparently insane &#8220;far enemy&#8221; strategy directed at the United States as the ultimate guarantor of the vile régimes all jihadis want to overthrow: secular, corrupt rulers of Muslim countries and of course Israel. Consider his objectives. As I understand them, these are:<br />1. To provoke the USA into a crusade against Muslims in general, a conflict of civilisations.<br />2. To provoke the USA into revealing the shallowness of its pretended values, in contrast to the authentic ones of Islam; and to show its true colours of exploitative greed, imperial power-lust and Zionist colonialism.<br />3. Aided by 1 and 2, to persuade the umma of Muslims to rally to a global jihad led by himself.</p></blockquote>
<p>After the fall of the Taliban, Osama bin Laden needed what he called a “gift from God” and President Bush’s incredibly stupid decision on March 19, 2003 to invade Iraq gave bin Laden just that.  I hate to say this – but we are ruled by idiots.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: CNN has a nice picture of Cheney looking like a scared kitten as he utters <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/22/cheney/index.html">this line</a>: <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;If we pull out, they&#8217;ll follow us,&#8221; Vice President Cheney said of terrorists in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s like Cheney is scared of his own shadow!  Our young men and women are putting their lives on the line – and for what?  Neo-McCarthyites who dodged the Vietnam War and have no clue what they are doing in the war on terror.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2006/06/privatizing_the.html">Richard Posner</a> argues efficiency gains.  As you might remember – I have <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/indiana-toll-road-efficiency-gains.html">my doubts</a> as to whether this argument was the driving force behind the deal:<br />
<blockquote>The idea of privatizing toll roads is an attractive one from an economic standpoint. Private companies are more efficient than public ones, at least in the limited sense of economizing on costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Posner provides a discussion of the complex deal that was a lot clearer than even the Crowe Chizek discussion and he also notes the following:<br />
<blockquote>I call this sense of efficiency &#8220;limited&#8221; because there are other dimensions of efficiency, for example the allocative; a monopolist might be very effective in limiting his costs, but by charging a monopoly price he would distort the allocation of resources. Some of his customers would be induced by the high price to switch to substitutes that cost more to make than the monopolistâ€™s product but that, being priced at the competitive rather than the monopoly price, seemed cheaper to consumers. (This is the standard economic objection to monopoly.) &#8230; There is, however, in the toll-road setting another source of allocative inefficiency, and that is monopoly, which I have mentioned already. Drivers who do not have good alternatives to using the Indiana Toll Road can be made to pay tolls that exceed wear and tear, congestion effects, social costs of pollution, and other costs of the road, engendering inefficient substitutions by drivers unwilling to pay those tolls. To an extent, the toll-road operator may be able to discourage substitution by price discrimination, but this is unlikely to be fully effective and indeed can actually increase the allocative inefficiency of the monopoly.  The monopoly issue raises the question: what exactly was Indiana selling when it leased the toll road for $3.8 billion? The higher the tolls and the greater the lessee&#8217;s freedom to raise the tolls in the future, the higher the price that the state can command for the lease. If the lease placed no limitations on tolls, the state would be selling an unregulated monopoly. If the lease could constrain the lessee to charge tolls just equal to the cost of operating the toll road (including maintenance, repairs, snow removal, lighting, and the collection of the tolls), the market price of the lease would be significantly lower. To the extent that the state wants to maximize its take from the lease, it will be creating allocative inefficiency by conferring monopoly power on the lessee. It is difficult to determine whether the $3.8 billion price tag for the Indiana Toll Road is closer to the competitive or the monopoly price level.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2006/06/on_privatizing_1.html">Gary Becker</a> continues the discussion and on balance is for privatization.  While I may be neither as enthusiastic about this deal as Becker and Posner are nor as trusting as the motives of Governor Daniels, I appreciate the fact that both go well beyond the corporate finance aspects of this deal.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Bruce Bartlett pens an op-ed for the <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MjYyYmZiYjlmMzQ0Mjc2MGFlYThiMDc0NjhjOTQ5ZGI=">National Review</a>, which seems to make two arguments.  His closing argument seems to be in line with <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/pick-your-effective-estate-tax-rate.html">something</a> I claimed: <br />
<blockquote>Finally, I often hear that repeal of the estate tax is unnecessary because proper estate planning can reduce or even eliminate it no matter how rich one is. On June 12, one estate-tax supporter had a letter in the New York Times saying that the tax was basically optional. “So repeal is unnecessary except for the uninformed, the unfocused or those people who are unwilling to pay their financial planning team a little more to make the tax go away or be reduced,” he wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>Almost all forms of taxation have elements of tax avoidance.  If we are going to continue to have an expensive government, doesn’t it make more sense to close to the loopholes than to make tax rates zero?<br />AB reader Cactus objects to this:<br />
<blockquote>Let us remember that before the repeal effort got going, the top rate on estates was 55 percent and all estates larger than $600,000 were subject to a tax of at least 18 percent.  The top rate applied to those larger than $3 million. It is simply absurd to believe, as estate-tax supporters implicitly argue, that people with such modest levels of wealth are rich in any meaningful sense of the term.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cactus was not sure where Bruce got the 18% figure, but the table provided by <a href="http://www.ctj.org/html/estate.htm">Citizens for Tax Justice</a> is helpful.  When Bruce talks about this 18% tax rate, that’s the marginal rate not the average rate.  So under the old tax regime – if the estate was valued at $610,000, the tax bill would be $1800 not $109,800.  </p>
<p>Also consider these sentences:<br />
<blockquote>Indeed, financial advisers today tell middle-class couples that they will need at least $1 million in financial assets to live comfortably in retirement. And with the big run-up in housing prices in recent years, it is not at all uncommon for middle-class families to live in $600,000 homes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where to begin?  First, why is Bruce comparing today’s nominal values to nominal exemptions under an old tax regime?  I’ll all for indexing the exemption as I’m for indexing the minimum wage.  If a liberal wanted to play Bruce’s game here, he could relate the $1.60 minimum wage of 1968 to prices of goods today even though the price-level is above 5 times higher today than it was in 1968 (and yes, the inflation-adjusted 1968 minimum wage was $8 per hour in today’s dollars).  </p>
<p>He is correct about middle-class families owning $600,000 if he is talking my neighborhood, which is in Los Angeles.  Most of my neighbors also tend to have mortgages so the equity in their homes is nowhere close to $600,000.  I’m sure Bruce is aware that if I died today, my kids would get the house only if they assumed the mortgage.  And if I’m thrifty enough to have $1 million in a 401(K) when I retire, I hope to consume most of that wealth.  So I seriously doubt my kids will have to worry about estate taxes.  </p>
<p>No – claiming the middle class will be hit by estate taxation is beneath Bruce’s usual standards.  But I can understand his problem here.  If he wants to publish something for the National Review, he has to meet its editor’s standards of rightwing malarkey.  Which is why he might consider not publishing for Rich Lowry’s rag.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Via <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002305.html">Max Sawicky</a> comes <a href="http://www.brook.edu/views/op-ed/20060531rogers.htm">Diane Lim Rogers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8216;Death Tax&#8217; Repeal Unfair to Those Who Owe &#8216;Birth Tax&#8217;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>That’s her title.  Here is a summary of the rest:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem is that there is no such thing as a free tax cut, unless — ironically in this case — you die before the bill comes due &#8230; This &#8220;birth tax&#8221; is a true cost imposed on all American babies. It cannot be repealed, no matter how upset Americans eventually get about it. Through the harmful effects of deficits on national saving, these future adults will be less likely to have the means to pay off these debts and are in danger of facing a lower standard of living than adult Americans today. So repealing the estate tax would swap a &#8220;death tax,&#8221; which affects hardly anyone and has been found to have little effect on economic decisions, for a higher &#8220;birth tax,&#8221; which would be universal and seriously detrimental to future economic growth.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>If you owned a business that you thought was worth at most $2 billion and someone offered you $4 billion – you’d likely take the offer.  Economists might also see the difference in the offer price and your reservation price as the efficiency gain of having your assets being combined with the assets of the acquisition firm.  Following-up on my earlier discussion of the proposed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/privatized-toll-roads-ii-did-mitch.html">Indiana Toll Road</a> deal, I took a close look at the analysis from <a href="http://www.in.gov/ifa/TollRoadFinancialAnalysis.pdf">Crowe Chizek</a>, which had been prepared for the State of Indiana.   Crowe Chizek’s assertion that these rights are worth only half what Cintra and Macquarie offered is why Governor Daniels is able to push this deal through – even as <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2138950/?nav=fo">Daniel Gross</a> argues that these private firms are ripping off the taxpayers:<br />
<blockquote>What&#8217;s in it for the foreign companies? Huge potential profits. Gigantic, steady profits. Toll roads are an incredible asset class. They&#8217;re often monopolies. They can support debt, since they provide a recurring guaranteed revenue stream that is likely to rise over time, as more people take to the roads and tolls increase. According to Cintra, the Indiana Toll Road generated $96 million in revenues in 2005, and Cintra expects a 12.5 percent internal rate of return on its investment. The heavy lifting has already been done: The state or federal governments have acquired the land and rights of way, built the roads and maintained them for years, and enacted toll increases. All the private companies have to do is deliver cash upfront, maintain the roads, and collect the windfall. The buyers can also increase their profits by making toll roads run more efficiently with technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the state could also run the toll roads more efficiently with technology.  But isn’t it evident that there has been a huge efficiency gain when the private firms can offer double the state’s reservation price as established by the Crowe Chisek discounted cash flow model?  After all, Cintra and Macquarie are still expecting an internal rate of return that is twice the 6% discount rate that Crowe Chisek is sensibly using.  The alleged efficiency gain would have to come from Cintra and Macquarie being able to run the toll roads not only more cheaply than the government but also more cheaply than the other bidders if this were a truly competitive auction.  Interestingly, Gross is suggesting that private entities expect a fairly high risk premium, which seems to go along with Brad DeLong’s risk arbitrage thinking in regards Social Security reform ideas – to which he might have a good laugh at this Bear’s expense as I have paid little attention to such risk arbitrage thinking.</p>
<p>No, that Cintra and Macquarie can get an internal rate of return that is double a reasonable discount rate by offering more than twice what Governor Daniels saw as his reservation price is hard to explain simply on the grounds of efficiency gains.  If this is not a gigantic efficiency gain, what explains the substantial difference between the Crowe Chisek DCF model and what Cintra and Macquarie seem to be modeling?  </p>
<p>There are four other possible explanations: (a) the Cintra and Macquarie discounted cash flow model is the kind of insane analysis that Andrew Fastow used to justify bad deals for Enron, which would mean Governor Daniels did snooker these firms;  (b) the Crowe Chisek analysis was insane; (c) the toll increases contemplated by Cintra and Macquarie exceed the toll increases contemplated by Crowe Chisek; or (d) some of the costs of running the Indiana Toll Road will still be borne by the government. </p>
<p>I’m afraid that explanation (b) is a real possibility as the Crowe Chisek is a real mess.  Its present value calculations don’t seem to follow from its (poorly explained) modeling assumptions.  And its modeling assumptions strike me as grossly understating the cash flows.  First of all, the write-up fails to tell us what the expected growth of revenues is, but it appears to be 4.3% per year.  The write-up also tells us that they are assuming general operating costs are expected to rise by 5.1% per year, but their tables appear to assume general operating costs rise by 6.1% per year.  I tried to replicate their model by assuming revenues in 2006 were $170 million with 4.3% growth through 2081, general operating costs in 2006 were $45 million with 6.1% growth through 2081, and repairs and maintenance costs in 2006 were $55 million with 2.5% growth through 2081.  My attempt to replicate their model estimates the value to be $2.3 billion, which exceeds their $1.9 billion as Crowe Chisek tossed in an interest expense deduction with no explanation as to why one would both deduct interest expenses from cash flows and also discount cash flows.  Notice something, however – general operating expenses start at 26.5% of revenues and rise to more than 90% of revenues by the end of the lease term.  Crowe Chisek offers no explanation for what appears to be an incredibly biased assumption.<br />I re-ran their model a couple of ways.  The first assumes both revenues and general operating expenses both increase by 5% per year.  Under these assumptions, the rights are worth almost $5 billion. Now one might wonder why Crowe Chisek assumed repairs and maintenance costs would grow at a lower rate than revenues and other costs.  Add to that the offsetting problem that Crowe Chisek assumed 2006 total costs were $100 million versus total costs in 2005 that were less than $70 million.  So my alternative model starts with total costs being $70 million but letting all costs rise by 5% per year.  This version has the estimated value being in excess of $5 billion.</p>
<p>So the Governor – aided by what appears to be a faulty Crowe Chizek analysis are selling assets that may be worth $5 billion to private investors for only $3.8 billion.  One could argue that I’m being very hard on Crowe Chizek.  But I would have hoped senior management would have spotted what appear to be flawed assumptions assuming they were asked to do a truly independent analysis.  Maybe they can explain their conclusions, but one would have thought they would have written a better report.  Then again – one might wonder of the Governor asked them to lowball the reservation price.  In other words, is this some form of financial fraud imposed upon the taxpayers?  Why would any responsible Governor be engaged in this kind of behavior?  Oh but – we are talking about George W. Bush’s first OMB director.  <br />As far as possible explanations (a), (c), and (d) – I have not seen the analysis that Cintra and Macquarie relied upon, so I would not be able to comment further.  If Daniel Gross has and if he is reading this post – we’d love to hear your insights.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://flyunderthebridge.blogspot.com/2006/06/it-tolls-for-thee-reputations-fellas.html">Roland Patrick</a> (aka Patrick R. Sullivan) attacks Max Sawicky (his name does not include mad except when referring to Patrick’s incessant nonsense) and then Patrick claims that <a href="http://signsofchaos.blogspot.com/2006/04/indiana-toll-road-once-again.html">Don Coffin</a> argued I was wrong with this statement:<br />
<blockquote>Cintra is paying $3.85 BILLION up front for this lease. And they expect a 12.5% internal rate of return. If I can still do arithmetic, that&#8217;s more than $400 MILLION per year in net income from the lease.. From a toll road currently generating only $96 MILLION in REVENUE (before any costs). And Cintra will be responsible for the operating costs, maintenance, and at least some expansion costs. The more I look at the numbers, the more I think it&#8217;s a better deal for the state of Indiana than I originally thought.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice the date of Don’s post – April 3, 2006.  Max and I only recently made our posts and if you read enough of what Don has said, Don has been thinking in terms of what might explain why Cintra would pay so much for something whose past profits were so modest.  The answer is obvious to anyone who understands finance – value depends on expected FUTURE cash flows.  Then again – Patrick first claimed Crowe Chizek was examining past performance when it is clear their (possibly flawed) DCF model was offering some spin on expected future cash flows.</p>
<p>And it would seem Mr. Patrick claims to have discovered <a href="http://flyunderthebridge.blogspot.com/2006/06/career-breaker.html">auction markets</a> as he refuses to believe that a politician might game the system.  And I thought he distrusted politicians – or is it that no GOP politician would game the system.  I see.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>We noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/renaming-laffer-curve.html">earlier</a> a rather dubious claim from Alan Reynolds: <br />
<blockquote>No economist ever claimed all taxes are so distortionary that increasing any tax rate would reduce revenue. Art Laffer never said that. Bob Mundell never said that. Larry Lindsey, Larry Kudlow, Paul Craig Roberts, Steve Entin and Bruce Bartlett never said that. I never said that.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would seem that <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTk5YTk0OWRiMjIxODdmNTQyNDdhYTJhZjlmNDc5YmQ=">Rich Lowry</a> is not an economist:<br />
<blockquote>Who says you can’t cut taxes, increase spending, and reduce the federal budget deficit all at the same time? That’s what the Bush administration has managed to do. Two decades after then-presidential candidate George H.W. Bush characterized Ronald Reagan’s idea that tax cuts would spur revenue-generating economic growth as “voodoo economics,” the witch doctor is again at work … The 2004 deficit had been projected to hit $521 billion, or 4.5 percent of gross domestic product.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Mr. Lowry did not read <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/budget-deficit-forecasts-and-cold.html">this</a>.  Lowry concludes:<br />
<blockquote>In light of that, we should be maintaining a high-growth, low-tax economy to reap all the benefits of growth, but dutifully restraining entitlements. That’s not sorcery, but just good sense.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, notice that Lowry never mentions what real GDP growth has been over the past five years.  I wonder if that’s because he realizes that the average annual growth rate has been anemic.  But this simple fact undermines his whole spin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: A few readers have suggested that Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Lowry are not contradicting each other, which prompts me to remind folks what <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~nroubini/SUPPLY.HTM">Voodoo Economics</a> means:  <br />
<blockquote>So why &#8220;voodoo&#8221; economics? There is some question about the magnitude of these effects, and the theory was way oversold at the time. Many &#8220;supply siders&#8221; argued that the incentive effects were so large that a reduction in tax rates would actually raise tax revenue, since the tax base would grow so much. There&#8217;s no sign that this happened, and indeed most economists were pretty skeptical of this prediction at the time. Quite to the contrary, the budget deficits exploded in the 1980s after tax rates were cut by Reagan in 1981. The response of private savings and labor supply to the Reagan tax cuts was minimal: the labor supply did not increase and the effect on private savings was swamped by the reduction in public savings (the increase in the budget deficit). Since labor supply and savings increased only marginally, government revenues did not increase (relative to GDP) and the budget deficit became very large. The Laffer curve hypothesis was was flatly contradicted. Moreover, the 1980s tax cuts did not increase the rate of growth of GDP and productivity, nor the investment and savings rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think Alan Reynolds understands all of this but it’s clear that Rich Lowry does not.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/06/the_effective_e.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes an analysis of the effective estate tax rate by <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/6-14-06tax.htm">Aviva Aron-Dine and Joel Friedman</a>:<br />
<blockquote>At the current $2 million exemption level ($4 million per couple) only one in every 200 people who die in 2006 will owe any estate tax at all.  Among the few estates that do pay the tax, the “effective” tax rate &#8211; that is, the percentage of the estate that is actually paid in taxes &#8211; will be much lower than the top estate tax rate, which is currently set at 46 percent.  According to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, the average effective estate tax rate on estates that owe any estate tax at all will stand at only 19 percent in 2006 … Why is the effective tax rate so much lower than the top tax rate established in law?  First, estate taxes are due only on the portion of an estate’s value that exceeds the exemption level, not on the entire estate … Second, a large portion of the estate’s remaining value can be shielded through available deductions (for charitable bequests and state estate taxes paid, for instance).  Additional options to mitigate the impact of the estate tax are available to family-owned businesses and farms, which can take advantage of special “valuation discounts” and can spread their estate tax payments over 14 years.  Further, many large estates employ planning devices (such as insurance trusts) to shrink the size of the taxable estate </p></blockquote>
<p>The first reason is simply the fact that average rates tend to be below marginal rates when there are exemptions ($4 million for a couple).  I’d like to expand on the third reason labeled special “valuation discounts” by considering an elderly couple who wish to leave the family business to their four heirs.  The business tends to generate $10 million per year in profits and if we reasonably assume a 10% cost of capital, this business is worth $100 million.  While the kids are eagerly hoping to get a 25% share of this business and keep $2.5 million per year in income, the estate attorney has calculated that 46% of $96 million (the $100 million minus the $4 million exemption) means the tax man would be looking to be $44.16 million.  Oh my – how will the kids deal with this?  After all – borrowing to pay the tax man means they’ll have to collectively pay $2.2 million in interest expenses to the banks.  Wait a second &#8211; each kid will still have $1.95 million in income each year.  How will they survive?</p>
<p>But back to the estate attorney who has a Rolodex of appraisers who will give him any whore answer for the right fee.  The appraiser/whore that is chosen to evaluate the fair market value of the business has three tricks up his (her) sleeve.  First, let’s assume that this S corporation (which pays no income taxes) has to become a C corporation (which of course is hogwash) so we can assume a phantom 40% income tax rate reducing $10 million to $6 million.  Next, let’s use some “build-up” approach (aka junk science) to assert a 20% cost of capital putting forth a value estimate of only $30 million.  Wow – magic, but we are not done.  Remember those “valuation discounts” for fictitious matters like minority owner discount (after all, the parents were all about cheating the kids) – which means we take an arbitrary 30% to 35% discount.  So now the business is appraised at $20 million and with the $4 million exemption, the tax bill is only $7.36 million.  Wow – an effective estate tax rate less than 8%.  But then the kids will have to borrow, which means each has to pay the bank around $90,000 a year in interest out of their $2.5 million per year in operating profits.  </p>
<p>Does this seem too easy?  Doesn’t the IRS have their own appraisers that can effectively rebut the bogus valuation reports commissioned by the estate attorney?  One would think so – but read most of the Tax Court decisions in this area and realize that even the National Review looks smart and honest by comparison. </p>
<p>Aviva Aron-Dine and Joel Friedman are suggesting relatively modest effective estate tax rates are observed in practice.  My guess is that they have likely overestimating these effective rates.  But when folks like Senator Kyl claim that people have to turn over half of their company to the government or the estate tax forces people to sell the family farm – they are either horribly ignorant or just telling you a pack of lies.</p>
