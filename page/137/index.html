<blockquote>Welcome to the Future—It’s Just Starting Now Like many of you, I have had a queasy feeling about the loss of privacy in the digital era.  Every online transaction and communication is out there for monitoring, profiling, packaging and retailing, and no promise by a company or government is going to change this.  The commercial implications are troubling enough, but what about the future?  What happens when a really bad government comes along and uses this information for outright repression?  Well, the future is now.  Read this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/a-high-tech-war-on-leaks.html" target="_blank">chilling report</a> on the use of new surveillance technologies to control what you can read about such matters as state-sponsored torture (the Kiriakou case) and corrupt insider contracts in the “war on terror” (Sterling).  If it had been Obama and not Google that campaigned on the slogan “Don’t be evil”, we could accuse him of breaking a promise. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>(hat tip David Zetland) for this informal note on the question of &#8220;Where are the investigative journalists?&#8221;.  This comment is from a reddit thread and is a beginning to thoughts of how to take personal responsibility for change.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Eslader writes on reddit in response to the question of &#8216;Where are the investigative journalists?&#8221;:  know? Ex-journo here. I&#8217;ll tell ya, if you have a minute or three.<br />
<blockquote>Exposes, dirt digging, etc, is expensive, both in money and in time spent by a reporter working on a single story over the course of several days, weeks, or months. Journalism these days has devolved to &#8220;at least one story per day&#8221; out of most reporters. In TV news, where I worked, you got 2-4 (sometimes more) stories handed to you in the morning meeting, and you had to have something turned by 4 &#8211; and that means shot, written, voiced, and edited which boils down to &#8220;you&#8217;d better be back in the station by 2 at the latest or you&#8217;re not going to make air, and if you don&#8217;t get back until 2, you have to write very quickly.&#8221; So basically, counting travel time, you have maybe 4 hours to research a story, interview the subjects, get your video, and drive back. That&#8217;s not much time at all for investigative work. It&#8217;s a lot cheaper and easier to just parrot whatever the guy says. The theory is that if he&#8217;s lying, his opponent will say he is, and then you can report what his opponent says and that he-said-she-said reporting is &#8220;balanced journalism.&#8221; And so you have an industry full of watercooler gossip mongers who are publishing stories at a prodigious rate, but managing to give us almost no real information at all.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Newspapers have it a little better, sort of, except that, as with most mainstream journalism shops, they&#8217;ve had cutbacks, salary freezes, etc. You have people in journalism making less than shift managers at McDonalds , </p>
<p>but who are supposed to be smart, sharp and savvy, and the math just doesn&#8217;t add up. If you&#8217;re smart, sharp, and savvy, you&#8217;re going to look at the student loan debt you will accumulate to get your journalism degree, and then you will look at the $17k or less starting salary, and the fact that you will probably lose your job several times over your career due to downsizing or straight out elimination of news departments, and you&#8217;ll say &#8220;screw that, it&#8217;s not worth it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Journalism has always been pretty low-pay unless you were a TV anchor at a large market station, but it managed to attract some good people because they were dedicated to the craft &#8211; to making a difference, and were willing to sacrifice the money in order to do that. Now that the &#8220;craft&#8221; has devolved into &#8220;news managers want the latest celebrity gossip a whole lot more than they want real news,&#8221; the craftsmen are leaving the business in droves. Of the people I worked with in my first job, only one is still in the profession, and he&#8217;s put up with more bullshit than I could ever think of dealing with unless I was getting compensated at the level of a CEO.</p>
<p>If Watergate happened today, Nixon would never have resigned. Woodward and Bernstein were very lucky &#8211; not only that Deep Throat pointed the way, but also that the Washington Post let them run with the story, even though it meant they&#8217;d be chasing it for years. You&#8217;d almost never find that today, because that would mean those reporters aren&#8217;t turning stories for today. Shop managers (many of whom rose up through the ranks from marketing rather than news) would rather 10 stories about what celebrity cheated on their wife than 1 story about political shenanigans that actually affects their readers.</p>
<p>Since journalists have very little time to become thoroughly grounded in their story&#8217;s subject, and news managers have very little interest in going in depth anyway, you end up with general-assignment reporters at political press conferences who may or may not know anything about politics. They have to get a story up ridiculously fast &#8211; often these days they&#8217;re supposed to tweet updates from the press conference while it&#8217;s still going on, which means they&#8217;re paying attention to tapping on a smart phone rather than thinking about what the guy is saying so that they can ask thoughtful questions. There&#8217;s simply no time to get into the hard-hitting journalism, even if there were still people left with the expertise to do it, which there aren&#8217;t because we&#8217;ve either quit like I did, or been canned because kids fresh out of college who have no news chops work cheaper than the 20 year veteran who knows what he&#8217;s doing.</p></blockquote>

Colonel Daniel Davis, a 17-year Army veteran recently returned from a second tour in Afghanistan. According to the Times, the 48-year-old Davis had written an 84-page unclassified report, as well as a classified report, offering his assessment of the decade-long war. That assessment is essentially that the war has been a disaster and the military&#8217;s top brass has not leveled with the American public about just how badly it’s been going.</p></blockquote>

<p>Levin proposed carried interest bill (HR 4016) </p>
<p>Sander Levin has proposed <a href="http://democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/media/pdf/112/LEVIN_Carried_Interest.pdf">H.R. 4016</a>, which would characterize allocation of partnership profits in respect of a &#8220;profits interest&#8221; received for services&#8211;i.e., carried interest compensation&#8211; of investment fund managers as ordinary income subject to employment taxes rather than allowing it to be treated as a share of the profits of a partnership, often garnering capital gains treatment if the partnership has mostly capital gains items. The <a href="http://democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/media/pdf/112/Description_of_Carried_Interest_Fairness_Act_Feb_14_Levin.pdf">technical description </a>provides both a good brief description of the issue and the way this bill addresses it. <br />
<blockquote>There is absolutely no reason why income earned for managing other people&#8217;s money shouldn&#8217;t be taxed in the same way as income earned teaching or working in a factory. This loophole for years has unfairly enabled some of the highest-paid individuals in the country to sharply reduce their tax bills and it is time to close it once and for all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Partnerships that hold investments assets or real estate held for rental or investment would be covered.<br />Let&#8217;s hope Congress does the right thing here. </p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <div>An article in yesterday’s New York Times, which I think deserves much more notice than it seems to be getting,  says that last week, “Mr. Romney’s campaign held <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/09/romney-holds-a-policy-round-table-but-attendees-must-raise-10000/" title="Times Caucus blog.">an elaborate “policy round table” fund-raiser</a> at a Washington hotel, featuring panel discussions run by lobbyists [who are] former cabinet officials or members of Congress.”</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Today in the Detroit News, that very same Mr. Romney has an op-ed piece complaining that the GM and Chrysler bailouts were “crony capitalism on a grand scale.”  The reason for the epithet?  That by prior agreement heading into the managed bankruptcies of those companies—bankruptcies that in fact were “managed” ones rather than just plain bankruptcies, and that therefore allowed the companies to emerge from bankruptcy and continue operating—union jobs received more protection than non-union jobs, and because Chrysler’s secured creditors were not protected. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Okay, well actually, he doesn’t acknowledge that the two companies did file for bankruptcy, and instead claims that they should have been forced to do so.  To file for &#8220;managed bankruptcy,&#8221; that is.  At least if I understand him correctly.  And actually, he claims (again, if I understand him correctly) that GM’s secured creditors will, by fiat of the Obama administration, not be repaid in full.  And he says that were it not for the bailouts, the companies would have survived without layoffs, or without as many layoffs, or without non-union layoffs … or ….
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>What?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In fact, as every Michigander (and Ohioan) knows, both companies filed for bankruptcy, the bankruptcies were &#8220;managed,&#8221; and both emerged from it much-downsized but still employing many thousands of people directly or via their suppliers.  And, as they also know, neither company would have emerged from bankruptcy at all without the government’s financial assistance.  Which is why the government agreed to the bailout.  
</p>
</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>And, according to a comment to the op-ed, GM&#8217;s secured creditors in fact were promised that they would be repaid in full, and expect to be. </div>
<div></div>
<p>So what’s Romney’s point? Best as I can tell, adding the actual facts to the op-ed, it’s that Chrysler’s secured creditors, who would have been paid virtually nothing had the company dissolved, weren’t privileged over the employees, in the restructuring.  This doesn’t sound to me like a serious plea for votes.  Not from employees—even laid-off ones—anyway.  And, since most of Chrysler’s secured creditors probably don’t vote in Michigan, not from the secured creditors either.  But maybe they’ll attend his next fundraiser, to meet those lobbyists whom Romney will delegate his policymaking to. </p>

                                <div>What if Eisenhower’s budget were your (grandparents’) family’s? What if Kennedy’s were? How about LBJ’s?  Nixon’s? What if Reagan&#8217;s were your parents&#8217; or your own family&#8217;s? How about G.H.W. Bush’s? Clinton’s? G.W. Bush’s?</div>
<div></div>
<div>One of my pet peeves is the use by political reporters and pundits of sophistic or downright imbecilic supposed analogies.  (Like last week’s classic from Politco’s Jim VandeHei, analogizing Obama’s justification for agreeing to team up with a Super PAC, notwithstanding his opposition to the <i>Citizens United</i> decision, to a teenager’s refrain that he wants to what “everyone else” is doing—as if what the teen’s friends are doing would have a profound effect on the teenager and others unless that teenager went along.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>So this morning when I clicked on the Yahoo News page, my opening page for one of the web browsers I use, and saw that one of the featured videos was a clip from last night’s ABC Nightly News broadcast, titled “What if Obama&#8217;s Budget Were Your Family&#8217;s?”, I shook my head in dismay at the sheer persistence of this ridiculously false analogy. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The clip begins with Diane Sawyer introducing a piece by ABC’s White House correspondent Jake Tapper purporting to explain Obama’s submitted budget by reducing the basic amounts of money—the budget total, the deficit in the budget, and the amount of debt already owed—by lopping off eight zeroes at the end, so that $38 trillion becomes $38,000 (a plausible middle-class annual expenditure), for example.  In this analogy, the family’s annual deficit is about $9,000, because this is a so-called working-class family whose annual income is $29,000. The $9,000 deficit will be added to the family’s already-existing “credit card” debt of $153,000.  Or something.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The clip then shows Tapper at Jay Carney’s press briefing yesterday asking whether, given the increase in amount of debt after one year, this isn’t irresponsible.  Tapper then moves to a Feb. 2009 clip of Obama promising to reduce the deficit his administration inherited, by one-half.  Tapper says Obama’s budget breaks this promise.<i>
</p>
<p></i></div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>Which it does, assuming that the promise wasn’t based partly on a proposal to end most of the Bush tax cuts.  The clip is, well, clipped, so its context is missing.  But since Obama’s attempts to end enough of the Bush tax cuts to substantially lower the deficit have been blocked by the Republicans, any reference to this broken promise should give Obama the opportunity to point this out.  All he has to do is actually take that opportunity to do that.  Which, with Obama, is problematic.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But as for the tiresome family-budget analogy, Obama himself is partly to blame for its persistence, having (stupefyingly) adopted it, repeatedly, himself rather than explaining the easily explainable: that the analogy is false and destructive.  Basic Keynesian economics is really not very hard to explain, so why make false representations of economic fact that undermine your policy positions, rather than bother to explain it?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But even just taking the analogy on its own terms, I’m wondering why all of that working-class family’s current $153,000 debt is described as credit card debt rather than, say, mortgage debt, or student-loan debt, or car-purchase debt owed as monthly car payments (and necessary for the family breadwinners to get to work).  Or why the credit card debt might not reflect necessary purchases such as food and gas, or, say, a furnace or roof replacement for the home.  Is their income too low for them to own a home?  Have a car?  Take out college loans?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And this is not even to mention that families cannot raise their annual income by deciding to do so, as governments can by, say, increasing tax receipts. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which brings me to the point in the title of this post: What if Eisenhower’s budget were your (grandparents’ or parents&#8217;) family’s? <i>Really</i> were?  What would the country be like now if it had been?  What if Kennedy’s were? How about LBJ’s?  Nixon’s?  How about Reagan’s?  G.H.W. Bush’s? Clinton’s? G.W. Bush’s?  And what if the current budget, and revenue-raising options, <i>really </i>were like your family&#8217;s?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Any takers?  Jake Tapper?

It also reflects many of the notions I suggested I’d implement <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/new-years-tax-wishes-if-i-was-dictator-of-america.html">if I was the Dictator of America</a>.<br />The basic problem with this and all comprehensive tax reforms, of course, is that the political system doesn’t work this way, can’t work this way, never has worked this way. We only move forward, improve the system, over centuries — with fitful, stumbling, fumbling steps, forward and backward, never addressing the whole economic ecosystem.<br />It makes biological evolution look downright intentional and speedy, by comparison.<br />All that said, I like this proposal. See what you think.
<div>1. Federal Income Tax:</div>
<div>All income and compensation is taxed at a 20% rate except:</div>
<div>&#8211; Income under a realistic poverty line (eg $15,000 for a single person), which is taxed at 2% instead</div>
<div>&#8211; Income used to pay for large medical expenses (>10% of income) is tax-free</div>
<div>&#8211; Income placed into tax-free education-retirement savings account (with modest caps)</div>
<div>&#8211; No other adjustments, deductions, or exemptions</div>
<div>Effective rates: 10% on $60,000;  15% on $160,000;  19% on $1,000,000.</div>
<div>Totals about 65% of federal revenue.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2. Federal Net-Worth Tax:</div>
<div>All net worth (accumulated wealth), except the first ~$800,000 is taxed at a progressive 1-1.7% rate.</div>
<div>This tax replaces property, capital gains &#038; estate taxes. Net-worth is the best measure of how much a household has profited from the economic infrastructure governments (all taxpayers) provide.</div>
<div>Effective rates: 0.2% on $1million;  1.0% on $3million;  1.7% on $27million and over.</div>
<div>Totals about 20% of federal revenue.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3. Federal War Tax: Everyone contributes to any war effort: A 6% surcharge increases a federal taxes bill of $10,000 to $10,600 while the nation is at war.</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>4. Eliminate all these taxes:</div>
<div>&#8211; Social Security Taxes – Social Security &#038; Medicare funded from general revenue instead</div>
<div>&#8211; Estate Taxes &#038; Capital Gain Taxes – Replaced by more efficient and fair Net-worth Tax</div>
<div>&#8211; State Income Taxes in their current form – Replaced by more efficient and fair surcharge – See #5</div>
<div>&#8211; Property (real estate) taxes – Replaced by more efficient and fair surcharge – See #5</div>
<div>&#8211; Sales taxes, tolls, etc. – Replaced by more efficient and fair surcharge – See #5</div>
<div>&#8211; Corporate Taxes – Profits distributed to corporate owners and taxed as income.</div>
<div></div>
<div>5. All states and local governments eliminate all their current taxes and instead set and collect a surcharge on a household’s combined Federal Income and Net-worth Tax.</div>
<div></div>
<div>6. Excise taxes only on products that have a cost to society that is not reflected in their price … e.g. cigarettes, gasoline.  Totals only about 10% of federal revenue.</div>

<p>U.S. Chamber and corporations fighting for low preferential capital gains rates</p>
<p>  A coalition of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and large multinational corporations such as Altria Group Inc. and Excel Energy Inc. is trying to pressure Congress to retain the extraordinarily low current tax rates on unearned income that will expire at the end of 2012 without action. </p>
<p>The alliance sponsored a report by Robert Carroll and Gerald Prante of Ernst &#038; Young that develops the idea of an &#8220;integrated tax rate on dividends&#8221; that includes the taxes paid by the dividend-paying corporation, the federal income taxes paid by the recipient, and the state taxes paid by the recipient. See Carroll &#038; Prante, <a href="http://www.theasi.org/assets/EY_ASI_Dividend_and_Capital_Gains_International_Comparison_Report_2012-02-03.pdf">Corporate Dividend and Capital Gains Taxation: A Comparison of the United States to other developed nations </a>(Feb. 9, 2012), Higher <a href="http://www.theasi.org/in-the-news/new-study.html">Capital Gains and Dividend Taxes Would Put U.S. Further Behind International Competitors</a>, Alliance press release (Feb. 9, 2012); Richard Rubin, <a href="http://www.theasi.org/in-the-news/corporate-coalition-says-obama-investement-taxes-near-world-high.html">Corporate Coalition Says Obama investment taxes Near World High</a>, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 9, 2012)(republished on the Alliance website). The report claims that the U.S. has an &#8220;integrated&#8221; rate of 50.8%. The report claims that such a rate &#8220;discourages capital investment, particularly in the corporate sector, reducing capital formation and, ultimately, living standards.&#8221; Richard Rubin, Corporate Coalition Says Obama Investment Taxes Near World High, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 9, 2012).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Robert Carroll is a former Bush administration official who regularly presents on behalf of corporatism&#8217;s Holy Grail of lower corporate taxes, lower dividend rates, and/or change to a territorial tax system for U.S. corporations. See, e.g., <a href="http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/CTP_Territorial_Article_02Jan2012/%24FILE/CTP_Territorial_Article_02Jan2012.pdf">Charting a Course for Tax Reform&#8211;Moving the U.S. Towards a Territorial Tax System</a> (Jan. 2012); <a href="http://vatinfo.org/2011/07/carroll-robert-ernst-young-llcs-center-for-tax-policy-considerations-for-a-value-added-tax-in-the-united-states-testimony-before-the-ways-and-means-committee-july-26-2011/">Considerations for a Value-Added Tax </a>(July 26, 2011) (arguing that a VAT-type consumption tax could permit lowering corporate tax rates). Carroll&#8217;s VAT article makes the same argument as here&#8211;that taxes hurt investment and therefore jobs.<br />
<blockquote>Greater reliance on value-added taxes, or other consumption-type taxes, to fund government can help improve economic performance because consumption taxes do not tax the return to saving and investment. By not taxing the return to saving and investment, these taxes reduce the cost of capital and lead to greater investment. Greater investment means more capital formation, and, ultimately, higher labor productivity and living standards than otherwise. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>But these arguments ignore the distributional impact of shifting taxes from corporations and wealthy stock traders to everyday Americans who make 30,000 or 50,000 or 75,000. The drive by the GOP and big corporations to save the wealthy from paying much in taxes shows no concern at all for the fact that the tax burden would be shifted to low-income Americans. <br />Not surprisingly, the tax rate analysis in this &#8220;for hire&#8221; E&#038;Y report is highly misleading. Let&#8217;s note the reasons, yet again.
<ul>
<li>The report assumes that shareholders bear the full brunt of the corporate income tax. Yet there is no conclusive evidence about the incidence of corporate tax. Many shareholders such as pension funds are tax exempt and pay no tax on the corporate dividends. </li>
<li>The report assumes that corporate income is taxed at the federal statutory rate of 35%, whereas in reality the vast majority of corporations pay zero federal income tax and those that pay tax pay an average around 24% effective tax rate (with many lower). Aggressive tax planning, cross-border tax credits, and various deductions (including greatly accelerated depreciation and expensing compared to actual economic wear and tear) allow corporations to reduce their tax liabilities much below the nominal statutory rate. While a chart on page 4 (showing a $100 income amount suffering the 35% corporate rate, an average state corporate rate, a 15% shareholder federal tax and a 4% assumed average shareholder state tax) indicates this is the &#8220;top&#8221; rate, most of the report discusses this &#8220;integrated&#8221; rate as though it were the actual rate paid. </li>
<li>The report disregards the fact that capital gains are also earned outside of corporations (as Dan Shaviro noted in the Bloomberg piece). It suggests that the corporate level tax will impact &#8220;each worker&#8221;:</li>
</ul>
<p>With less capital available for each worker to work with, labor productivity is lowered, which reduces the wages of workers, and ultimately, Americans’ standard of living. Report at 5.<br />Yet much of the work done in this country is not done for major corporations. There are partnerships and S corporations and sole proprietorships all operating businesses and providing capital gains in appropriate contexts. (And of course most of the capital gains that are being taxed aren&#8217;t earned from money that was invested in corporations but rather from corporate stock bought in the secondary market. All this talk about capital for workers is irrelevant to those secondary market trades. See this point below.)
<ul>
<li>The conclusions disregard the fact that investors can defer taxation of capital gains indefinitely by choosing when to sell, and that many gains are never taxed at all over multiple generations, since heirs receive corporate stock (and other assets) with a step-up in basis. (Text accompanying footnote 5 merely mentions that the effective rate &#8220;might&#8221; be lowered by this fact; the footnote notes that &#8220;common practice&#8221; for determining the impact would give an integrated tax rate of 43.1%.) </li>
<li>Chuck Marr, at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, also indicated that &#8220;the report also ignores the total tax burden around the world. In 2009, U.S. tax revenue of 24.1 percent of gross domestic product was 9.7 percentage points below the unweighted average of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.&#8221; As a result, &#8220;the United States is actually a very low-tax country compared to all these other countries.&#8221; Richard Rubin, Corporate Coalition Says Obama Investment Taxes Near World High, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 9, 2012). </li>
<li>The report purportedly compares top integrated tax rates among the developed countries. But does it really include all the relevant taxes for other countries? It is not clear that the VAT, for example, has been included in countries where a VAT is a significant addition to regular income taxes: the report mentions only corporate income tax rates and dividend tax rates in discussing other countries&#8217; &#8220;integrated&#8221; rates. </li>
<li>The report ignores the fact that there is at best a very slim correlation between the transfer of funds to a business entity for use in running the business and capital gains taxation. Most corporate stock is purchased in the secondary markets, not at IPOs. Most of the gains that are taxed are therefore just accretions in value as corporate stock changes hands from one investor to another. There is no benefit of capital formation for the corporation from the trade&#8211;the money goes into the pockets of the one who sells, possibly to be reinvested offshore in an emerging market economy or to purchase the stock of another U.S. MNE. </li>
<li>The report assumes that half of any increase in dividend taxes is absorbed into share value but the other half &#8220;influences investment decisions&#8221;. n.12. This is one of those &#8220;anything goes&#8221; assumptions that is so annoying about supposedly empirical work that tries to &#8220;predict&#8221; how behavior will be affected by taxes. </li>
<li>The report discusses a &#8220;marginal effective tax rate&#8221; and suggests that corporate capital will be reduced by that rate, resulting in less expansion and less job creation. But that rate as shown here includes the statutory tax rate on the corporation&#8217;s profits and the shareholders&#8217; tax rate on its unearned income from holding corporate stock. Even if one thought that using the statutory rate to discuss corporate tax burdens was reasonable (which I do not), this mingled rate is not the relevant rate that the corporation would consider in determining whether it was profitable and could expand and add on workers or jobs. The corporation may retain its profits and use them to expand or provide working capital, and not pay dividends to shareholders. Many corporations have in fact foregone dividends and instead invested in share buybacks, which give a perceived benefit from reducing the total number of outstanding shares. Interestingly, while the report uses this mingled rate to argue that taxes are bad because it will keep corporations from investing and hiring (pp5-6), it also argues that taxes on unearned income of shareholders from corporations will mean corporations will retain those earnings and &#8220;overinvest&#8221; in the corporation (p7). Talk about trying to have your pie and eat it too. </li>
<li>The argument that fungible investor capital will necessarily flee the country if capital gains rates are allowed to go back to at least the level they were under Clinton, as GOP representative Peter Roskam from Illinois suggests, id., simply misundersands what drives investment decisions and the way our tax system works. </li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Many other factors drive investors to purchase stock, whether in IPOs or in the secondary market, including the stability of a country&#8217;s markets, the vigorousness of economic growth, the price-earnings ratios of corporate stocks, the economic outlook for particular industrial sectors, etc. </li>
<li>Americans are taxed on their worldwide income, so they don&#8217;t avoid the US tax on capital gains unless they expatriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taxes are just one factor, and in fact corporate stocks traded quite well when capital gains taxes and dividends taxes were much higher than they are now. Many experts think that removing the preferential rate for capital gains would be the most reasonable way to level the playing field for workers and managers/owners, while raising billions to offset the federal deficit. </li>
<li>The distributional effects of very low capital gains tax rates are detrimental. Most of those who benefit from the preferential capital gains are the wealthy who own most of the financial assets, with about 2/3 of the benefit going to millionaires, according to the Tax Policy Center. Id.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taxes on earned income&#8211;salary and wages&#8211;are graduated, rising to a maximum of 35% for top income earners. Taxes on unearned income, such as dividends from qualifying corporations or gains from sales of corporate shares, are only 15%. This significant disparity in rates (35% compared to 15%) means that the wealthy who own most of the financial assets and have most of the capital gain income enjoy an extraordinarily preferential tax rate. The result is that wealthy individuals like Mitt Romney can end up paying a significantly lower tax rate than construction workers, firefighters and schoolteachers. That&#8217;s unreasonable: the nation would be better served by eliminating the capital gains preference and using those funds to rebuild public infrastructure.</p>
