<blockquote><strong>China says no change in monetary policy</strong></p>
<p>China&#8217;s renminbi currency traded briefly outside its tightly controlled band on Friday, triggering a renewed wave of speculation that the government was set to allow a long-expected revaluation.</p>
<p>&#8230;Traders said the renminbi, which has been pegged to the US dollar for a decade, was briefly in the market at a rate of Rmb 8.2700 to the dollar, outside of the usual band of 8.2760 to 8.2800.</p></blockquote>
<p>For a temporary 0.07% deviation in the Renmimbi exchange rate to make headlines suggests that a lot of people not directly involved in currency trading are very, very interested in what happens in that particular market&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Apparently, February&#8217;s incredibly low savings rate was not the bottom for the US, because in March it went even lower.  Since I&#8217;m in a charty kind of mood today, here&#8217;s the picture&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/savrate_mar05.jpg">
<div>(Note: the bump at the end of 2004 is due to Microsoft&#8217;s one-time dividend payout in December.)</div>
<p>This incorporates the most recent data on personal income and spending, <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/newsrel/pinewsrelease.htm">released this morning by the BEA</a>, which showed that the household savings rate in the US was just 0.4% of household disposable income in March.  That&#8217;s the lowest monthly savings rate since October 2001, when US consumers embarked on a patriotism-fueled spending spree to make up for a dearth of spending the month before. </p>
<p>This morning&#8217;s report also showed a substantial increase in income in March of 0.5% (though the increase was just enough to keep up with inflation), and an even more substantial increase in spending.  With luck, strong income growth will continue in coming months and help erase some of the pessimism brought on by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/gdp-growth-first-quarter-2005-advance.html">yesterday&#8217;s GDP report</a>&#8230;</p>

                                <p>So what&#8217;s the deal with inventories, anyway?  You may have been wondering a bit about that in the wake of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/gdp-growth-first-quarter-2005-advance.html">yesterday&#8217;s GDP report</a>, in which inventory changes played such an important role; one-third of economic growth in the first quarter of 2005 was simply due to firms building up their stocks of inventories.  </p>
<p>Studying inventory changes may not be the sexiest topic in the field of macroeconomics&#8230; but it turns out to be an extremely important one.  That&#8217;s because a) inventory changes are notoriously volatile, and thus play a big role in variations in GDP; and b) inventory changes can sometimes give us some information about where the economy is headed.  This chart shows the change in inventories in each quarter in recent years:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/inventories1.jpg"></p>
<p>Clearly the most recent quarter stands out &#8211;  it was the largest build-up in inventories since the middle of 2000, right before the economic slow-down.  But what does it mean?  </p>
<p>The subtlety about interpreting inventory changes is that there are different reasons that firms may increase their inventories: they may do it unintentionally, if they are over-optimistic about their sales forecasts and thus produce more than they can sell; but they may do it intentionally, if demand is growing, in order to keep a steady ratio of inventory-to-sales.  To make interpretation even a bit more complicated, note that firms&#8217; desired inventory to sales ratio has been steadily declining over time as inventory management gets better:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/inventorytosales.jpg"></p>
<p>Looking over a longer time period we can tentatively identify episodes of both types (intentional and unintentional) of inventory accumulation.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/inventories2.jpg"></p>
<p>Inventory growth in 1994 and 2000 heralded slowdowns in economic growth.  But inventory growth in 1997 and 1998 was simply a function of businesses keeping up with rapidly growing demand.</p>
<p>So how should we interpret the inventory numbers from the first quarter of 2005?  Were they a sign that firms sense that demand is growing, which might cause them to intentionally keep a larger stock on hand?  Or were they an unintentional buildup in inventories that firms will have to undo next quarter by slowing down their production?  Looking at other economic data right now gives us no reason to think that firms are expecting a strong surge in demand.  Hence (despite the somewhat contradictory inventory to sales ratio, which is still quite low) my guess is that firms will probably try to slow production to reduce their inventories next quarter.  And slower production, combined with possibly negative inventory growth, could spell a very low GDP number indeed for the second quarter.  But we shall see.</p>

                                <p>Back in 2003, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/bartlett060903.asp">Bruce Bartlett</a> criticized the Smetters-Gokhale use of present value analysis but <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/bartlett200504280951.asp">now</a> he seems to like such calculations.  To be fair, I have used such calculations, while Max Sawicky notes that they look like ginned-up large numbers unless put in the context of the present value of future GDP over the same horizon.  And Bruce does close with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>To make these very large numbers somewhat more concrete, Social Security’s unfunded liability comes to 1.2 percent of GDP in perpetuity …  Avoiding such tax increases is the best reason to reform Social Security now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, my problem with his latest NRO op-ed is that he does not tell us what reforms will avoid the need to raise taxes.  Is he talking about benefits cuts or some form of Cato-style free lunch?  Of course, President Bush is supposed to inform us tonight what his “reforms” will be.</p>

                                <p>Are you tired of having the radical right preach to us about what God allegedly wants in the political arena?  <em>Tax Analysts</em> reports on this story from Sierra Leone:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tax officials in Sierra Leone offended the country&#8217;s Christian population after launching an advertising campaign on April 25 that claimed that Jesus Christ wanted them to pay their taxes, Agence France-Presse reported on April 25. The half-page newspaper advertisements claimed that &#8220;all Christians should follow the teachings and example of Jesus Christ. This week: Pay your taxes!&#8221; The ads were aimed at the primarily Muslim nation&#8217;s Christians, who make up approximately 30 percent of the country&#8217;s population. The ad used a passage from the Bible&#8217;s Gospel of Matthew as its source in determining what Jesus&#8217; tax advice would have been. &#8220;Pay the emperor what belongs to the emperor and pay to God what belongs to God,&#8221; Jesus said on the topic of paying taxes to the Roman Emperor (Matthew 22:17-21). Reaction from Sierra Leonean clergy has ranged from outrage to calls for the &#8220;blasphemous&#8221; ads to be stopped immediately, according to the report. The tax department defended the ads as an effort to increase compliance among the nation&#8217;s taxpayers. The ads were an attempt to encourage people to pay their taxes as soon as possible, a tax department spokesperson was quoted as saying. </p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This morning <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/newsrel/gdpnewsrelease.htm">the BEA reported</a> that its advance estimate of GDP growth in the beginning of 2005 came in somewhat below expectations, which were for about 3.5% growth:<br />
<blockquote>Real gross domestic product &#8212; the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States &#8212; increased at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter of 2005, according to advance estimates released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  </p>
<p>&#8230;The deceleration in real GDP growth in the first quarter primarily reflected a deceleration in equipment and software, an acceleration in imports, and a deceleration in PCE that were partly offset by accelerations in private inventory investment and in exports.</p>
<p>&#8230;The price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices paid by U.S. residents, increased 3.0 percent in the first quarter, compared with an increase of 2.9 percent in the fourth.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not a very good report.  In fact, I think it was pretty bad.  Much of GDP growth in early 2005 was apparently driven simply by a massive build-up in inventories; over 1.2% of the 3.1% GDP growth rate was due to inventory growth.  But obviously, GDP growth can not be sustained by inventory growth.  Furthermore, such inventory growth suggests that businesses may need to rein in production a bit.</p>
<p>The time series for GDP growth and inflation over the past four years looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/gdp1.jpg"></p>
<p>Much of the growth in GDP over the past couple of years has been driven by investment spending, both by businesses and on housing.  But business spending slowed markedly in the beginning of 2005, and residential investment spending has been considerably cooler in the past 3 quarters compared to 2003 and early 2004:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/gdp2.jpg"></p>
<p>Finally, notice the US&#8217;s continuing current account problem: imports, which are much larger than exports in the first place, continue to grow faster than exports.  The effect of the weaker dollar on exports has yet to make itself felt:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/gdp3.jpg"></p>
<p>All in all, a disappointing report.  If the apparent slowdown in investment spending continues (and there&#8217;s no reason yet to think that businesses have picked up the pace of spending from the levels of early 2005), then GDP growth for the year may be less than 3%.  That is not a horrible growth rate, but it is a bit disappointing to those who hoped for another year or two of strong economic growth in the US before this phase of the business cycle was over.</p>

                                <p>In my view, <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">CalculatedRisk</a> is the blog’s leading authority on the housing market.  Having read the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200504270852.asp">John Tamny</a>, James Grant’s <em>Forbes</em> article is something we might all read as well.  But Tamny disagrees with Mr. Grant’s assertion that higher interest rates tend to reduce the value of houses:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though the prime-lending rate rose from the single digits in 1976 all the way to 19 percent in 1979, real estate took off. Gilder noted that by 1979, “the value of individually owned dwellings had reached $1.3 trillion dollars, twice the worth of individually owned corporate stock.” He added that half of the newly minted multimillionaires in 1978 achieved their fortunes in real estate. Grant cites three “brutal property bear markets: 1974-75, 1980 and 1990-92,” but in each case the prime rate was falling during the years mentioned.</p></blockquote>
<p>I might ask Mr. Tamny to distinguish between changes in nominal v. real housing prices as well as changes in nominal interest rates v. real interest rates, but I suspect CalculatedRisk has already covered these concepts thoroughly.</p>
<p>Two more things: Tamny suggests that the prime interest rate was falling in 1980.  One might ask why did he mention the prime interest rate and not <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data/m/cm.txt">mortgage interest rates</a>, which actually rose during 1980.  And Tamny bothers to check, it turns out that the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data/m/prime.txt">prime rate</a> may have been high and volatile, but was not falling over the year.  Oh well, I guess understanding the data means one is not qualified to write for the NRO.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;m not a regular follower of durable goods orders, and I don&#8217;t generally pay much attention to whether it goes up or down in any particular month.  This morning&#8217;s release was slightly more eye-catching than usual, however; durable goods orders have now fallen for three consecutive months, which starts to look more like a trend than temporary variation&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;cid=580&#038;ncid=580&#038;e=1&#038;u=/nm/20050427/bs_nm/economy_orders_dc">Reuters</a>) &#8211; New orders for long-lasting U.S.-made goods plunged unexpectedly in March, the biggest drop since September 2002, the government said Wednesday.</p>
<p>A sharp drop in orders for aircraft pushed new orders down by 2.8 percent, the Commerce Department said. Excluding the volatile transportation category, orders for durable goods &#8212; pricey manufactured items meant to last three years or more &#8212; sank 1 percent, the department said.  Revisions moved the previous months&#8217; reading lower as well. Commerce adjusted the February durable goods orders down to a 0.2 percent decline from a 0.5 percent increase, and revised the durable goods orders ex-transportation lower to a 0.2 percent drop from unchanged.</p>
<p>The report offered a generally gloomy picture for factory and business spending plans. Wall Street economists had expected durable goods orders to climb 0.3 percent overall and 0.5 percent excluding transportation.  The total level of new orders was at its lowest since June 2004. Durable goods orders excluding defense fell 3 percent, the biggest drop since September 2002.</p></blockquote>
<p>Orders for durable goods are probably more of a leading indicator than a coincident indicator, but nevertheless, I&#8217;m starting to suspect that the estimate of first quarter GDP growth (due out tomorrow) could be lower than the average guess of around 3.5%&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Shortly after reading <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/health-care-intelligence-failure.html">PGL&#8217;s healthcare post</a>, I came across this in a Wired article, Cracking the Real Estate Code (should be <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/">available here</a> on May 5th), by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, authors of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/006073132X/qid=1114582315/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-5172118-6671008?v=glance&#038;s=books&#038;n=507846">Freakonomics</a>. Their Wired article describes how markets can go awry in the face of significant asymmetric information, primarily noting that real estate agents tend to keep their own houses (on which they pocket about 97% of any resulting increase in the sale price) on the market for longer than their clients&#8217; houses (on which they pocket only 1.5% of any increase in price from holding out longer). Along the way Levitt and Dubner point out that asymmetric information also rears its head in the healthcare market:<br />
<blockquote>Of course, sometimes an expert might manipulate his advantage for his own benefit. If your doctor suggests that you have an angioplasty – even though current research suggests hat angioplasty often does little to prevent heart attacks – your first thought won’t likely be that the doctor is using his informational advantage to make a few thousand dollars for himself or his buddy. But as David Hills, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA061EF935590C708DDDAA0894DD404482&#038;incamp=archive:search">explained to The New York Times</a> (pay-wall), a doctor may have the same economics incentives as a care salesman or a funeral director or a mutual fund manger: &#8220;If you’re an invasive cardiologist and Joe Smith, the local internist, is sending you patients, and if you tell them they don’t need the procedure, pretty soon Joe Smith doesn’t send patients anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or consider these findings of a 1996 medical study: Obstetricians in areas with declining birthrates are more likely to perform cesarean section deliveries than obstetricians in growing areas – suggesting that when business is tough, doctors may try to ring up more expensive procedures. </p></blockquote>
<p>While the aggregate impact of such asymmetric information on healthcare costs are, to my knowledge, unknown and unestimated, they are one potential example of the &#8220;significant inefficiencies&#8221; I hypothesized in the conclusion to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/health-care-in-us-and-world-part-iii.html">this post</a>. For another example of asymmetric information leading to higher healthcare costs (though not to worse care), see <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/W9972">How Do Hospitals Respond to Price Changes?</a>, forthcoming <a href="http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/contents/accepted.html">in the AER</a>, by Leemore Dafny.</p>

                                <p>Has the Fed under Alan Greenspan been so sanguine about the US economy&#8217;s potential problems that its behavior verges on the irresponsible?  Some economists think so, and their voices seem to be getting louder.  For years now Paul Krugman has written that he thinks Greenspan is more of a cheerleader for the Bush administration than a responsible, neutral arbiter of monetary policy.  Recently <a href="http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displayStory.cfm?story_ID=3773742&#038;subjectid=348876"><em>The Economist</em></a> (subscription required for this piece) has also expressed worries about the Fed:<br />
<blockquote>[T]op officials at America&#8217;s Federal Reserve appear quite relaxed about the country&#8217;s current-account deficit, just as it hits a new record&#8230; Central bankers are paid to worry. Perhaps America&#8217;s need to worry a little more.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the most striking critique came yesterday, with <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/GEFdata/digests/20050425-mon.html">Stephen Roach&#8217;s</a> scathing discourse on how the Fed has abandoned its job of keeping over-optimism in check:<br />
<blockquote>In all my years in this business, never before have I seen a central bank attempt to spin the debate as America&#8217;s Federal Reserve has over the past six or seven years.   From the New Paradigm mantra of the late 1990s to today&#8217;s new theories of the current-account adjustment, the US central bank has led the charge in attempting to rewrite conventional macroeconomics&#8230; I am not a believer in conspiracy theories.  But the Fed&#8217;s behavior since the late 1990s is starting to change my mind&#8230;</p>
<p>The Fed&#8230; has also become the intellectual architect of the New Macro.   Time and again, since Alan Greenspan rolled out his New Paradigm theory in the late 1990s, senior Federal Reserve policy makers have taken the lead role as proselytizers of a new macro spin that condones the saving, debt, property bubble, and current-account excesses of the Asset Economy. </p>
<p>&#8230;Is this is an appropriate role for a central bank?   In my view, absolutely not.  The problem with an activist central bank is that decision makers in the real economy &#8212; consumers and businesspeople alike &#8212; mistake the Fed&#8217;s point of view for strategic advice.  And so do financial market participants.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether or not you agree with Roach&#8217;s warnings that the US economy is a &#8220;House of Cards&#8221; poised to collapse, he raises an interesting point: to what degree has the Fed abdicated the traditional central bank role as the economy&#8217;s leading proponent of conservative economic behavior? And to what degree does it matter?</p>
<p>I do share some of Roach&#8217;s concerns about this, though not as dramatically as he does.  The Greenspan Fed has been a surprisingly (to me, anyway) strong proponent of the &#8220;Optimistic View&#8221; (OV) of the US economy. In the 1990s the OV held that the &#8220;new economy&#8221; meant that everything was going to be okay, even if share prices rose bizarrely high and savings rates dropped very low.  Today the OV holds that rapidly rising household debt is no problem, there is no housing bubble, and the current account deficit is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>According to the most direct measure of central bank performance, inflation, these embraces of the OV have done no harm &#8211; inflation has stayed well under control through it all.  The Fed&#8217;s reassurances that inflation was not an incipient problem in the late 1990s were quite correct, for example.</p>
<p>But I think most economists would agree that the OV has never been self-evidently correct, and thus could have been (or be) wrong.  Even if the Fed&#8217;s complacency about potential problems for the US turns out to be entirely justified, I wonder if it is appropriate for a central bank to give such intellectual support to the OV.  One problem is something Roach points out &#8211; the Fed&#8217;s endorsement of the OV may create moral hazard and encourage more risk-taking behavior than would normally take place.</p>
<p>But another problem is simply that the Fed has been staking out somewhat controversial opinions that say that the old rules of macroeconomics are wrong and new rules apply.  What if they&#8217;re wrong? If it turns out that the Fed&#8217;s OV about current financial abnormalities was wrong, then serious financial and inflationary problems could be in store for the US.  It could then take many years (or in Roach&#8217;s case, probably decades) to repair its credibility as an institution that has a solid understanding of the macroeconomy, and therefore a solid control over inflation. </p>
<p>Credibility is the single most important asset that any central bank possesses, and is one that is very painful to earn.  The probability of such a damaging blow to Fed credibility is probably low&#8230; but the cost would be extremely high, and thus for an inherently conservative institution like a central bank, the risk may well be worth avoiding.  On the other hand, what harm would be done if the Fed remained agnostic on whether the OV is warranted?  What harm would be done if the Fed did not actively try to promote the opinion that the US CA balance is nothing to worry about?  It&#8217;s hard for me to see any. </p>
