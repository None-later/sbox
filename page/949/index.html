                                <p>An AP story carried by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/20/white.house.abramoff.ap/index.html">CNN</a> shows that the White House was paid many visits by “Republican activists Grover Norquist and Ralph Reed” over the past 6 years.  White House spokeswoman Dana Perino had an odd way of excusing the visits by Mr. Norquist:<br />
<blockquote>He is one of a number of individuals who worked to advance fiscal responsibility, which is one of the key aspects of the president&#8217;s agenda</p></blockquote>
<p>I seriously doubt Mr. Norquist asked Karl Rove if the pork barrel spending for his clients could be reduced.</p>

                                <p>Hat tip to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/09/chevrons_tax_windfall_on_new_o.html#006294">Dean Baker</a> for spotting an excellent article by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/business/12oil.html?ex=1315713600&#038;en=1c242b5586b161e0&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">Edmund Andrews</a>: <br />
<blockquote>A group of oil companies led by Chevron, which said last week that they had discovered a huge new oil field in the Gulf of Mexico, could avoid more than $1 billion in royalty payments to the federal government for the oil. The potential bonus to Chevron and its partners stems from a mistake the Interior Department made in signing offshore leases in the late 1990’s for drilling in federal waters … Chevron and its partners, Devon Energy and Statoil ASA of Norway, have six leases in the Jack oil field, about 175 miles off the coast of Louisiana. Two of the leases allow the companies to avoid royalties on as much as 87.5 million barrels of oil per lease. The benefit, known as royalty relief, was supposed to be halted if the price of oil climbed above $36 a barrel. But that restriction was omitted on all leases signed in 1998 and 1999, including the two held by Chevron and its partners. The exact value of the potential break on federal payments will depend both on the price of oil and how much of it comes from the two leases. At $70 a barrel, the Chevron group could save about $1.5 billion in royalties if the government agreed that both leases were contributing to Chevron’s production &#8230; The Chevron leases are the biggest, but hardly the only leases that allow oil companies to avoid royalties regardless of how high energy prices climb. Even before Chevron and its partners confirmed the discovery last week, the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, had estimated that the Treasury could lose as much as $20 billion over the next 25 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the political side, Republicans might argue this occurred under Clinton’s watch – and it turns out that Congressional Republicans are as angry at the Interior Department as Congressional Democrats (if not angrier).</p>
<p>Back in November 2000, the CBO issued an interesting discussion entitled <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=2695&#038;sequence=2">Reforming the Federal Royalty Program for Oil and Gas </a>: <br />
<blockquote>One-quarter of the nation&#8217;s crude oil production and one-third of its natural gas come from federal mineral leases. In recent years, oil and gas leases have generated federal revenues of between $5 billion and $6 billion a year, mainly in the form of royalties that leaseholders pay to the government as a percentage of the market value of the oil and gas they produce … The government assigns most federal oil and gas leases through competitive auctions, in which businesses bid an up-front payment (known as a bonus) and agree to pay rents on undeveloped lands and royalties on any future production. After production begins, the lessees pay royalties based on the market value of their sales, as reported each month to the Minerals Management Service. Federal lessees generally pay 12.5 percent (one-eighth) of the value of production from onshore leases and 16.7 percent (one-sixth) of the value from offshore leases as royalties. However, lower rates may apply for onshore production from marginally profitable fields and for offshore production from deep waters and certain largely unexplored areas of the Atlantic coast. In some cases, the government may even waive royalties on oil and gas from low-output wells if market conditions warrant. In recent years, the royalties paid by lessees have averaged less than 10 percent of the value of oil from onshore leases and 15 percent of the value from offshore leases … Federal lessees calculate their royalty payments as their proceeds from the sale of oil and gas, minus certain costs that the government allows them to deduct, times the applicable royalty rate. The calculation is not straightforward, however, because of the difficulty of estimating sales proceeds and deductible costs. Sales proceeds reflect the marketable volume of production from the lease site and the unit market value of the product (the value per barrel of oil or cubic foot of natural gas). Under current regulations, marketable product is oil and gas that is sufficiently free from impurities to be acceptable to a typical buyer in that region. Market value reflects the price that a competitive market would establish for the product. That value depends on the location of the market (the point of sale) and the quality of the product at the time of sale. The value may differ from the sales price, depending on the competitive relationship between the buyer and the seller … To ensure that the sales prices reported by lessees reflect a competitive market value, current regulations also consider the relationship between the market participants. If the buyer and seller have competing interests &#8211; that is, the sale is an arms-length transaction &#8211; and the transfer of ownership takes place at the lease site (or central accumulation point), MMS considers the market value to be the actual sales price. For crude oil, the actual price is often the posted price for the oil field. For an arms-length sale that takes place elsewhere, regulations provide two options for calculating royalty payments. One is based on an actual price for a reported competitive transaction in a nearby oil or gas field. The other estimates the value back at the lease site by deducting from the actual sales price the costs of moving the product from the lease site (or central accumulation facility) to the point of sale. Two-thirds of federal oil and gas is sold to marketers, pipelines, or refiners that are affiliated with the lessee and, hence, do not have competing interests. For those non-arms-length transactions, a new regulation published on March 15, 2000, requires that lessees impute a unit value at the lease site on the basis of prices published for regional spot markets, with discounts for differences in location and quality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Two takeaways from this discussion: (1) the government is attempting to base royalties on the market value of the rights owned by the government; and (2) the government is aware that vertically integrated energy companies can game the system through transfer pricing manipulation.  The appropriate royalty structure is an issue that transfer pricing economists (calling OldVet) might wish to ponder and I can see why one would wish to have no royalties if the price of oil fell below its production costs (e.g., $36 as a proxy?) – perhaps with a higher royalty rate imposed on the economic rents from oil extraction.  But despite the efforts to insure companies such as Chevron pay the market price of the rights to these offshore oil fields, someone in the government found a way to give away a lot of taxpayer wealth to these energy companies.</p>

<blockquote>There have been many estimates of Sarbanes-Oxley’s costs. It has rasied the overall cost of operating as a public company by 130 percent, according to the law firm Foley and Lardner. It has added 30,700 man-hours for each firm, according to the trade group Financial Executives International. Additional time that you have to spend complying with accounting is time that you can’t spend on developing your product. A Korn-Ferry survey found on average $5 million in costs devoted to this for Fortune 1000 firms. But those surveys, which I wrote about in National Review, have all been superseded by an academic economic study by Ivy Zhang of the Graduate School of Business at the University of Rochester. She found that there has been a $1.4 trillion market loss attributable to Sarbanes-Oxley.</p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, the $1.4 trillion decline in stock valuations was not entirely due to the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley.  But if a company’s operating costs were increased by a factor of 1.3, it would surely have massive losses unless its operating profit margin had been around 60% before the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley.  </p>
<p>The author is <a href="http://www.cei.org/dyn/view_expert.cfm?expert=259">John Berlau</a> and his attack on Sarbanes-Oxley was picked up by <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Y2VkNDRlODc2M2M1NjNhMjYyYmY3YzVhYjcxZDU0NTQ=">Iain Murray</a> who thinks extending Sarbanes-Oxley globally will somehow hurt our war on terrorism.  </p>
<p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTllNGE4MjMxYmRiMGQ1ZGU4Y2U2MDZlZDczNTY3M2E=">Mallory Factor</a> continues the spin and recommends:<br />
<blockquote>Why not make Sarbanes-Oxley compliance optional for public companies?</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds like George W. Bush’s proposal regarding the treatment of expenses related to employee stock options – let companies have the option whether to follow FASB 123 or not.  Had enough insanity?  Me too, se let’s check out the latest from the sensible <a href="http://www.danielgross.net/archives/2006/09/17-week/index.html#a001167">Daniel Gross</a>: <br />
<blockquote>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says that if the accounting industry isn&#8217;t given special protection when it commits negligence and gets in bed with crooked clients, we could all be doomed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah yes, we should all return to the wild, wild west days when the robber barrons received government protection and the little fellow got the shaft!</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>While microeconomists often assume our economy operates near the production possibility frontier, they also concede that inefficiencies may exist even during periods of full employment. James Tobin often noted: “It takes a lot of Harberger triangles to fill one Okun&#8217;s gap”, which was his way of suggesting that the deadweight losses from recessions are often much larger than the deadweight losses that microeconomists worry about.  </p>
<p>In his critique of a bizarre argument from <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_39/b4002001.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_businessweek+exclusives">BusinessWeek</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_09/009520.php">Kevin Drum</a> reminds me of the wit and wisdom of the late James Tobin.  First, the bizarre claim from BusinessWeek:<br />
<blockquote>For years, everyone from politicians on both sides of the aisle to corporate execs to your Aunt Tilly have justifiably bemoaned American health care &#8211; the out-of-control costs, the vast inefficiencies, the lack of access, and the often inexplicable blunders. But the very real problems with the health-care system mask a simple fact: Without it the nation&#8217;s labor market would be in a deep coma. Since 2001, 1.7 million new jobs have been added in the health-care sector, which includes related industries such as pharmaceuticals and health insurance. Meanwhile, the number of private-sector jobs outside of health care is no higher than it was five years ago … What they&#8217;re waking up to is the true underpinnings of the much vaunted American job machine. The U.S. unemployment rate is 4.7%, compared with 8.2% and 8.9%, respectively, in Germany and France. But the health-care systems of those two countries added very few jobs from 1997 to 2004, according to new data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation &#038; Development, while U.S. hospitals and physician offices never stopped growing. Take away health-care hiring in the U.S., and quicker than you can say cardiac bypass, the U.S. unemployment rate would be 1 to 2 percentage points higher &#8230; John Maynard Keynes would nod approvingly if he were alive. Seventy years ago, the elegant British economist proposed that in tough times the government could and should spend large sums of money to create jobs and stimulate growth. His theories are out of fashion, but substitute &#8220;health care&#8221; for &#8220;government,&#8221; and that&#8217;s exactly what is happening today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin shakes his head and then comes up with a very reasonable reply:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;m not sure what to think about this. In one sense it&#8217;s just statistical trickery: at any period in American history, if you remove the single fastest growing industry from the picture then the rest of the economy is going to look pretty anemic. In fact, that&#8217;s true of nearly any statistical analysis: remove the highest scorers or the highest earners or the highest anything else, and by definition, what&#8217;s left over looks a lot gloomier. On the other hand, deliberately running an entire industry less efficiently than the rest of the world is a helluva thin reed on which to base an economy. As Anderson says, since taxpayers are the ones footing the bill for healthcare in other countries, they&#8217;re more willing to pay for technologies that cut costs. In America, doctors bear the burden of adopting IT enhancements but don&#8217;t make any money from them (they might make less, in fact), so they&#8217;re pretty unmotivated to bother with the whole thing. The fact that this inefficiency means we employs a lot more people than we would if we had a rationally run system is hardly a great rallying cry for the status quo. A national healthcare system, besides being tremendously beneficial for the actual consumers of healthcare, would also align the market incentives more reasonably and reduce costs considerably. I&#8217;m willing to take the risk that we&#8217;ll somehow figure out what to do with all the jobs and money we save along the way.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have two reactions to this bizarre argument from BusinessWeek.  One is to suggest that increasing employment is not necessarily a sign of inefficiency.  After all, a rational health care system would provide more and better healthcare services to more individuals – albeit at a lower price per treatment.  The other reaction goes to the main theme here by reminding BusinessWeek that John Maynard Keynes would hardly “nod approvingly” at using inefficiency to restore full employment.  </p>
<p>Keynes did note the <a href="http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/mandev.htm">Fable of the Bees</a> <br />
<blockquote>Although apparently often treated as a defense of laissez- faire &#8211; &#8220;Thus every Part was full of Vice/Yet the whole Mass a Paradice&#8221; &#8211; the Fable can also be seen as a presentation of early underconsumption theory. Anticipating Keynes&#8217;s paradox of thrift, Mandeville argued that the &#8220;moral&#8221; activity of saving was actually the cause of recessions whereas luxurious consumption (a &#8220;vice&#8221;) was a stimulus. Indeed, Mandeville argued for government intervention, including the Mercantilist policy of protection to promote internal consumption</p></blockquote>
<p>Keynes also made a concession to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/monetary-policy-abandoning-gold.html">gold bugs</a> with the <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch10.htm">following argument</a>: <br />
<blockquote>It is curious how common sense, wriggling for an escape from absurd conclusions, has been apt to reach a preference for wholly “wasteful” forms of loan expenditure rather than for partly wasteful forms, which, because they are not wholly wasteful, tend to be judged on strict “business” principles. For example, unemployment relief financed by loans is more readily accepted than the financing of improvements at a charge below the current rate of interest; whilst the form of digging holes in the ground known as gold-mining, which not only adds nothing whatever to the real wealth of the world but involves the disutility of labour, is the most acceptable of all solutions. If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coalmines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again (the right to do so being obtained, of course, by tendering for leases of the note-bearing territory), there need be no more unemployment and, with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community, and its capital wealth also, would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is. It would, indeed, be more sensible to build houses and the like; but if there are political and practical difficulties in the way of this, the above would be better than nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>The BusinessWeek argument assumes away the ability of the government to find a more rational means for achieving full employment that the creation of wasteful activities.  Such an argument has also been used to justify initiating wars to restore full employment.  Six years ago, I would have suggested our Federal government was better than that.  Alas, the current Administration may be proving BusinessWeek to be more correct.</p>

                                <p>The National Review’s nuttiness over commodity price standards as guides for monetary policy has reached another low in the latest from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTJhZjYzNmY0ZmMwODEwNjQyMWRmNGYzNjVmNjdiZTY=">John Tamny</a>:<br />
<blockquote>With the price of copper up over 300 percent since 2001, thefts of vases from gravesites, air conditioner components, gutters, and water pipes have risen as criminals have sought to sell the copper they contain at inflated prices. Just as “scarcity” and rising demand from India and China have been fingered as the cause of oil’s rise, both are cited as the reason for copper’s rally &#8211; not to mention subsequent criminal efforts to access it illegally. Monetary blunders are rarely mentioned in all this, despite the fact that since 2001 the nominal price rise in dollars of both copper and oil has been over double that registered in euros. Importantly, since commodities are priced in dollars, it seems that history often repeats itself every time the dollar loses value &#8230; Returning to current monetary blunders, every supposed oil and commodity “shock” since 1971 has occurred alongside a major drop in the value of the dollar versus gold, and subsequently all commodities. Since both oil and copper are world commodities, the fact that their prices have risen so substantially in dollars as opposed to euros in recent years makes plain the impact of dollar instability on the nominal price of commodities. It follows that these nominal changes impact investment in future commodity discoveries, and go far toward explaining why commodity prices have surged past their ten-year averages. Changes in the dollar’s value quickly register in the spot price of all commodities, with a rising currency driving away investment, and a falling currency attracting capital. This mal-investment does a lot to explain the “gluts” and “shocks” that have occurred since we left the gold standard in 1971. The above chart tracks the oil price since 1947 &#8211; and the contrast between the stable-dollar years of Bretton Woods (1944-1971) and the aftermath is pretty striking. Despite a major rebound of the world economy post-WWII, oil prices were largely flat up until 1971 &#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>OK, let’s stop right there and remind Mr. Tamny that we had an acceleration of inflation during the late 1960’s because monetary expansion accommodated an unwise policy of excessive fiscal stimulus aka the combination of the Vietnam War, the War on Poverty, and an inability to reverse the 1964 tax cut.  Sort of remind you of the current situation: the Iraq War, an expensive Prescription Drug Benefit, and Bush’s zest for even more tax cuts.  Thank goodness, the current Federal Reserve had adopted some monetary restraint.  But put me down on record that I don’t want more monetary restraint regardless of the fact that the relative price of oil is indeed high.  We might also remind Mr. Tamny of the fact that the inflation of the late 1960’s led to balance of payment issues, which precipitated Nixon’s 1971 decision to abandon Bretton Woods.  </p>
<p>Nixon’s decision to engage in excessive aggregate demand expansion preceded the run-up in oil prices.  By the time Gerald (no relation to George) Ford wanted to “Whip Inflation Now”, we were in a recession so Tamny’s claim that the Federal Reserve should have tried to peg the price of oil would have been a calamity in terms of macroeconomic stability.  </p>
<p>But let’s also consider the implications of his call for pegging the price of oil with monetary policy by looking at the period of the first Iraq War – 1991.  We were in a recession, which could be blamed on the Greenspan FED not increasing the money supply sufficiently as George H. W. Bush tried his dose of fiscal responsibility.  Had the Greenspan FED listened to Tamny’s nonsense as the price of oil spiked, the Bush41 recession would have been much deeper and more prolonged.  </p>
<p>Tamny seems to think commodity price volatility can be eliminated if we had the right monetary policy.  He forgets that real shocks exist and any attempt to smooth nominal prices of commodities would result in great macroeconomic instability – not less.  These National Review nitwits haven’t a clue as to what a rational approach to monetary policy happens to be, which is why you’ll likely see a call from easier monetary policy from one of these know-nothings right after they’ve called for tighter monetary policy.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Be forwarned… this is a rant.</p>
<p>Well, this is the week I’m on call for jury duty.  I just called in, and apparently I have to report for duty tomorrow.</p>
<p>As noted I noted in a post a month ago, I’m against what has been done to the jury system.  I think it makes no sense to have a judge decide what the jury can and cannot hear, and then have the jury make the decision.  I can’t think of many situations that don’t involve GW in which the least informed person in the room makes the decision, especially one of such potential magnitude.  As to worries that the jury might be biased – sure, all 12 jurors might be Fox viewers, but the odds of that are much less than that one political appointee judge who controls what the 12 jurors see is a Fox viewer.  How should a juror react when asked to make an important decision, possibly a life or death decision about another person, do so in good conscience knowing full well that someone with unknown biases and prejudices (and for all that juror knows, mental instability) decided what that juror was allowed to see?</p>
<p>But this rant is about something else.  While seething about having to actually wear pants tomorrow (and for who knows how many other days), I started thinking about attorneys.  I remember something my father, a physicist, once said about Bill Richardson when Richardson was Secretary of Energy.  My father doubted that Richardson could come up with a reasonable definition of the word “energy.”  Looking at Richardson’s wikipedia entry right now, I suspect my father was right.  Other than a law degree, it seems Richardson’s primary qualification to make decisions about, say, nuclear reactors, was studying French.  His second most important qualification seems to be having played baseball in college.</p>
<p>A more recent example of an expert calling out an attorney with big political job occurred during the mad cow scare some years ago.  (I’m wondering if there’s a reason we shouldn’t still be worried…)  Ann Veneman, the Secretary of Agriculture had been explaining all the wonderful ideas she and her staff were doing.  Shortly after, there were a few interviews with Stanley Pruisner, the dude who won the Nobel Prize for discovering prions in the first place.  Apparently he had been trying to warn Veneman for a long time about the impending problem, and the kindest thing about her he was able to say was that she was ill-informed. </p>
<p>Even dropping out of law school can help get you somewhere.  Witness Don Rumsfeld, apparently attempting to be the first American Secretary of Defense to lose two major wars, assuming he doesn’t get his way in the next few months (in which case he might lose a third one).</p>
<p>Which leads to two questions with which I’ll end my rant…<br />1.  There are some positions that are clearly off-limits for attorneys, such as Surgeon General or Chair of the Joint Chiefs.  These (at least the Surgeon General position) can’t possibly be any more difficult or critical, say, than sitting on the board of the Federal Reserve or head of the EPA or FEMA.  What makes these positions so special that they are reserved for someone who at least appears to have some minimum expertise as opposed to an obvious ignorant political hack?<br />2.  Why is it OK to have an attorney making decisions about nuclear power, or how to combat mad cow disease or scrapie, or whatever else, regardless of the attorney’s level of ignorance on the subject at hand, but not OK to have, say a physicist with no legal training on the Supreme Court or a biologist with no legal training as Attorney General?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Last month, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/irs-privatizing-collection-of-back.html">PGL cited </a>an article by David Cay Johnston. I’m often behind the times, so I figured I’d touch on <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A15FD3F5B0C708EDDAE0894DE404482&#038;fta=y&#038;incamp=archive:article_related">another theme </a>that Mr. Johnston often covers (and which is often brought up in the comment section of this blog by regular commentator OldVet), namely that there are many ways to cut taxes, and one is simply to cut enforcement. But… when there are tax cuts as a result of reduced enforcement, do those tax cuts affect everyone equally?</p>
<p>One simple proxy for how interested an administration is in enforcement of existing tax rules is to look at how much of the federal budget goes toward the IRS. I didn’t find information on the IRS&#8217;s own budget in a quick google search, but <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist04z2.xls">OMB Table 4.1 </a>indicates what share of the budget goes to each Federal Agency, and presumably the share that goes to the Treasury is a good proxy for the funding received by the IRS.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/03in05tr.xls">this table </a>we can data on the share of federal income taxes paid by those in the top 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, and 50% of income makers from 1985 to 2003. We can then break it out into the following groups: top 1%, 1% to 5%, 5% to 10%, 10% to 25%, 25% to 50%, and bottom 50%.</p>
<p>The correlation between the Treasury’s share of the budget in any given year and the amount paid in taxes by each group is shown below:</p>
<p>Income Group__Correlation With Treasury’s Share of Budget<br />Top 1%_______0.48<br />1% to 5%______0.20<br />5% to 10%____-0.56<br />10% to 25%___-0.47<br />25% to 50%___-0.39<br />Bottom 50%___-0.44</p>
<p>What about Treasury’s average share of budget over a five year period?</p>
<p>Income Group__Correlation With Treasury’s Share of Budget, 5 years<br />Top 1%_______0.87<br />1% to 5%______0.71<br />5% to 10%____-0.76<br />10% to 25%___-0.87<br />25% to 50%___-0.85<br />Bottom 50%___-0.90</p>
<p>And Treasury’s share of the budget over 10 years?</p>
<p>Income Group__Correlation With Treasury’s Share of Budget, 10 years<br />Top 1%_______0.82<br />1% to 5%______0.82<br />5% to 10%____-0.73<br />10% to 25%___-0.91<br />25% to 50%___-0.92<br />Bottom 50%___-0.97</p>
<p>Therefore, using the 1985 to 2003 sample available from the IRS, we find that the higher the share of the budget that goes to the Treasury Department (and presumably, therefore, the higher the share of the budget that goes to the IRS), the higher the share of total taxes paid by the top 1% of income earners and the top 5% of income earners. Everyone else’s share of share of total amount paid in taxes falls.</p>
<p>Conversely, as the Treasury (and the IRS) receive less, those in the top 1% and the 1% to 5% of income earners pay a smaller share of total taxes, and everyone else pays more.</p>
<p>Stated bluntly, when enforcement is lax, those who are both willing and able to cheat do so. And if you are wondering…. the Treasury Department’s share of the budget over the past few years:</p>
<p>Year___Share<br />2000___21.7%<br />2001___20.8%<br />2002___18.4%<br />2003___17.0%<br />2004___16.4%<br />2005___16.5%</p>
<p>Postscript. As always, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them.<br />Postscript 2. It seems to be a particularly auspicious time to post this, considering that PGL just posted something about Mitch Daniels, who as head of the OMB from 2001 to mid-2003 was one of the key people when it came to allocating pieces of the budget.</p>
<p>Update:  Minor grammatical changes made.</p>

<blockquote>When he worked at the White House, Mitch Daniels wasn’t always the most popular guy in the room. It’s not an uncommon problem for the head of the Office of Management and Budget, whose job includes telling the president and federal agencies how much less money they’ll have to spend than they want. That’s one reason why Daniels, who as Indiana governor has spent a lot of time trying to balance the state’s budget, probably won’t be fazed by new poll from WISH-TV in Indianapolis, showing Hoosiers aren’t very happy with him. Daniels, a Republican, was rated in the fair or poor categories by 57% of all respondents (although just 35% of Republicans). The poll of 800 likely voters conducted from Sept. 5 to Sept. 8 found that 55% think the country is headed in the wrong direction while 41% say its going the right way. Daniels isn’t up for re-election this fall. But three Indiana congressional seats are in play, which is why both Republicans and Democrats are pouring money and resources into the conservative state. Among local issues, voters appear to still be miffed about Daniels’s decision to lease a northern Indiana toll road to an international conglomerate as well as the continuing drama over the state’s effort to pick a time zone.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/09/department_of_h_3.html">Brad DeLong</a> has called Mitch Daniels the worst OMB director ever so it’s no surprise that he responds with:<br />
<blockquote>But&#8230; but&#8230; but&#8230; everything I have heard&#8211;everything everyone I know has heard&#8211;is that Mitch Daniels did not do his job as OMB Director: that he was remarkably complaisant when anyone from White House Communications or Political Affairs wanted to raise spending or cut taxes. Certainly nobody I have talked to who worked in the Bush Treasury has said a good word for him, or has described him other than as an enabler of fiscal insanity. That almost every OMB Director save Daniels has taken his job seriously doesn&#8217;t mean that Daniels did. And I certainly haven&#8217;t seen any signs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ms. Schatz also seems to think Mitch Daniels is a fiscal conservative as governor (“spent a lot of time trying to balance the state’s budget”) but let’s see if we can explain why the voters are miffed with the toll road decision.  As long term readers of Angrybear know, I have posted several comments on this decision including <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/indiana-toll-road-takeover-triumph-of.html">this one</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Some would argue these deals are based on efficiency gains where the private firms and taxpayers both win. Others &#8211; like yours truly &#8211; wonder if they may be some political favoritism going on where taxpayer assets are being sold below their true value.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or let’s go back to what <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2138950/?nav=fo">Daniel Gross</a> suggested:<br />
<blockquote>If a governor told you there were a way to spread pork, raise funds for infrastructure investment, promote jobs, avoid raising taxes, and put a dent in the trade deficit—all in one fell swoop—you might think he had a bridge to sell you. And you&#8217;d be right. Only in this case, it&#8217;s a toll road. And instead of a sale, how about a long-term lease?</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, the State of Indiana got $3.8 billion upfront for this deal, but as Mr. Gross and others have noted, the foreign firms got the rights to collect tolls many years:<br />
<blockquote>What&#8217;s in it for the foreign companies? Huge potential profits. Gigantic, steady profits. Toll roads are an incredible asset class. They&#8217;re often monopolies. They can support debt, since they provide a recurring guaranteed revenue stream that is likely to rise over time, as more people take to the roads and tolls increase. According to Cintra, the Indiana Toll Road generated $96 million in revenues in 2005, and Cintra expects a 12.5 percent internal rate of return on its investment. The heavy lifting has already been done: The state or federal governments have acquired the land and rights of way, built the roads and maintained them for years, and enacted toll increases. All the private companies have to do is deliver cash upfront, maintain the roads, and collect the windfall.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shifting revenues forward but reducing them over the long-term is not balancing the budget, but it does seem to be how GOP politicians play the game.</p>

                                <p>Forgive the long post.  This one is a bit complicated.</p>
<p>Last week I had a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/cutting-taxes-view-from-2001.html"> post </a> showing that, based on information available in the year 2000, the top of the Laffer curve for the highest marginal personal income tax rate was probably in the neighborhood of between 42.4% and 51.4%.  I noted that based on this, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/budtoc.html"> GW’s promises </a> to “pay off the debt, deliver meaningful tax relief and address needed priorities, while preserving nearly a trillion dollars as protection against uncertainties” were just as ludicrous at the time as they look now.  </p>
<p>The post received many comments.  Among the most substantive criticisms was one from happyjuggler0, who stated:  “[b]ehavioral changes occur with changes in tax rates. It ought not to be too surprising to think that a tax rate cut in one year will yield lower revenues the next year unless the rates are in the stupidly high category….  At the same time, a hike in tax rates would likely also yield higher revenues in the year after the hike.”</p>
<p>To extend his comment, in a given year, if taxes are cut, collections will be lower, but eventually people will adjust, work harder, leading to a faster growing economy and greater tax collections.  Happyjuggler0 also indicated that looking at taxes as a percentage change of GDP makes no sense because as taxes go up, it could stifle growth.  Therefore, if tax collections as a percentage of GDP fall after taxes are reduced, it could be the case that tax collections are increasingly rapidly, but GDP is rising even more rapidly.  These are classic arguments, and they make sense.  But do they fit the facts?</p>
<p>Let’s begin by looking at happyjuggler0’s second point – do tax cuts lead to increased growth?  We can simply take the correlation between <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist10z1.xls"> real GDP </a> growth and <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histaba.pdf"> tax rates, </a> but that happyjuggler0 could again, rightfully point out, that perhaps over time, the effect of taxes is different than their effect over the short haul.  Presumably, 5 years is enough time for taxpayers to change their behavior – instead of looking at the highest marginal tax rates in any given year, we will look at the “five year average of the highest marginal tax rates” (i.e., that year, and the preceding four years).  </p>
<p>The following table shows the average of the “five year average of the highest marginal tax rates” for each sample period.  It also shows the correlation between the “five year average of the highest marginal tax rates” and the growth rate of real GDP in any given year.  </p>
<p>   Sample       Av High  Correlation<br />1950 &#8211; 2000___68.87____0.11<br />1960 &#8211; 2000___64.10____0.12<br />1970 &#8211; 2000___56.64___-0.04<br />1980 &#8211; 2000___48.96____0.00<br />1990 &#8211; 2000___37.36____0.70</p>
<p>How to interpret this?  Well, it seems over the entire 50 year sample, there is a slight positive correlation between five year average tax rates and the growth rate in real GDP.  In other words, an increase in the five year average of the highest marginal tax rate tends be associated with higher growth in real GDP.  From the 1970- 2000, the correlation is slightly negative, from 1980 to 2000 it is pretty much zero, and from 1990 to 2000, it is positive and high.  </p>
<p>Results are essentially the same if the “five year average of the highest marginal tax rates” are lagged by a year, if the Clinton years are excluded, or if the ten year average is used instead of the five year average.  Therefore, it doesn’t seem like there is much of a pattern, indicating that there probably isn’t much relationship between the highest average tax rate over the past five years and the growth rate in real GDP.  (If there is any relationship, it is that as taxes rise, it seems that growth rates increase.  This seems to be especially true in recent years, and has manifested itself more as tax rates have dropped.)  </p>
<p>Given the lack of a relationship between tax rates and growth rates in GDP, the argument for tax cuts bringing in more revenue essentially means that tax cuts lead to higher tax revenues as a percentage of GDP. </p>
<p>The table below shows the average of the “five year average of the highest marginal tax rates” for each sample period, and the correlation between the “five year average of the highest marginal tax rates” and tax revenues as a percentage of GDP in any given year.  </p>
<p>   Sample       Av High  Correlation<br />1950 &#8211; 2000___66.44___-0.36<br />1960 &#8211; 2000___60.93___-0.26<br />1970 &#8211; 2000___53.60___-0.17<br />1980 &#8211; 2000___45.30____0.11<br />1990 &#8211; 2000___35.65____0.55</p>
<p>This produces results similar to those in the earlier post…  it would seem that the top of the Laffer curve for the five year average of the highest marginal tax rate appears to be somewhere between 45.3% and 53.6%.  </p>
<p>Now… here is where it get its interesting….  the table below considers the correlation between the “ten year average of the highest marginal tax rates” and tax revenues as a percentage of GDP in any given year.  </p>
<p>   Sample       Av High  Correlation<br />1950 &#8211; 2000___68.87___-0.45<br />1960 &#8211; 2000___64.10___-0.41<br />1970 &#8211; 2000___56.64___-0.35<br />1980 &#8211; 2000___48.96___-0.28<br />1990 &#8211; 2000___37.36___-0.37</p>
<p>In other words, this table suggests that over a ten year period, the higher the highest average tax rate, the less taxes are collected.  (I note – leaving out the Clinton years, the familiar Laffer curve shape appears, with a “high point” between 63% and 70%.)</p>
<p>A recap:<br />1.  There is a slight positive correlation between average tax rates over a five year period (and a ten year period) and growth rates in GDP.  Therefore, over the long run, the higher the tax rate, the faster the economy grows.  This would imply that those subject to the highest marginal rate spend their money is not as efficient at creating wealth than the government.<br />2.  Fitting a Laffer curve to one year (as in the previous post) or five year average highest marginal tax rates, we find that the tax rate bringing in the highest revenues over a one or five year period is somewhere in the neighborhood of 50%.  <br />3.  The higher the ten year highest marginal rates, the lower the tax revenues as a percentage of GDP.</p>
<p>The results seem somewhat contradictory (to me at least).  For both 1 and 3 to be true, an increase in the highest marginal tax bracket would, over a ten year period, lead to slight increases in GDP growth but decreases in tax revenues over the same period.  Additionally, at current tax rates, that would also lead to more tax revenues over a five year period.</p>
<p>(For those interested in something more technical, I also tried running some regressions for each sample period.  The regressions took two forms:  1) dependent variable:  tax receipts, explanatory variables:  5 year and 10 year average highest marginal tax rate, and one year lagged tax receipts, and 2) the same regressions but without one year lagged receipts).  In almost all cases, the coefficients on both five and ten year average highest rates were significant, with the former being positive and the latter being negative, one exception being the regression for the 1990s alone, leaving out lagged tax receipts, in which case the ten year variable was not significant.)  </p>
<p>At this point, I’m flummoxed.  I think one of the following must be the case:<br />a.  Findings 1, 2, and 3 are all true<br />b.  Findings 1 and 2 are true, finding 3 is an artifact of the data<br />c.  Finding 3 is true, findings 1 and 2 are artifacts of the data.</p>
<p>My guess, and perhaps its just my bias, is that Finding 3 is just an artifact of the data, but I can’t explain it, and at this point its run up against the amount of time I’m willing to give it.  Perhaps it’s a good thesis topic (hint hint hint to any graduate students).  </p>
<p>So… I’ll throw it open.  Anybody know what’s going on?</p>
<p>Postscript.  As always, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them.<br />Postscript 2.  In the comment section, commentor Reason provides a simple explanation for what might be going on.  To rephrase Reason&#8217;s point: </p>
<p>Tax rates fall leading to greater concentration of income at the high end, as tax cuts tend to be focused on the high income earners. While this doesn&#8217;t lead to increased growth in the economy as a whole (and possibly leads to slower growth overall), it does increase the amount of income that is subject to taxes, leading to (in the long run) greater taxes being collected.  Ironically, this policy of benefiting high income individuals also benefits the government, but not most of the population.  Somehow this doesn&#8217;t strike me as being the way Laffer tells it, but unlike with the supply-siders story, it does seem to fit the facts.</p>

In other words, the changing energy market has changed the political market as well, and in a way that helps Republicans if they proceed correctly.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ll likely hear a lot of <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/696wnfcp.asp?pg=2">GOP gloating</a> over this recent drop in gasoline prices in the run-up to the 2006 elections even though – as <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/09/gasoline_prices_2.html">James Hamilton</a> notes – one could have predicted this decline:<br />
<blockquote>Although crude oil prices can be quite hard to predict, retail gasoline prices are at times a little easier, because it often takes some time for price declines in crude oil or bulk gasoline to work their way down to the retail level. A useful advance indicator of where retail prices are headed is the NYMEX gasoline futures contract, which yesterday traded down to $1.55. This futures price does not include taxes or the wholesale and retail markup, which in recent years have averaged about 60 cents a gallon. Using that 60 cents benchmark, a retail gasoline price below $2.20 a gallon appears to be quite reasonable to anticipate. So why are gasoline prices coming down so dramatically? There are important seasonal factors in U.S. gasoline prices, which are higher in the summer due to summer fuel requirements and greater gasoline demand. Everyone always seems as shocked when prices go up in the spring as when they come down in the fall, even though to some extent that same pattern is repeated every year. However, much more than just the usual seasonal is in operation this fall. The drop in crude oil prices, down $14/barrel over the last month, has now become the dominating factor. Some might be tempted to attribute part of the recent decline in crude oil prices to last week&#8217;s widely publicized ultra-deepwater production tests from the Gulf of Mexico. However, it seems pretty unlikely that this has made a material contribution to crude oil prices.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Hamilton provides a graph of retail gasoline prices over the past 3 months.  Our diagram traces this price back to 1994 and was constructed using data from <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/wrgp/mogas_history.html">this source</a>.  Notice that we saw $3 a gallon gasoline right after Katrina, which was followed by a similar decline.  Gasoline prices are not low – they have been volatile.  Some of the recent volatility has been due to swings in the refinery margin but much of it has to do with changes in oil prices.  <a href="http://www.wtrg.com/daily/oilandgasspot.html#Brent">This source</a> shows how oil prices spiked up to $77 a barrel because the most recent decline.  It also provides a <a href="http://www.wtrg.com/oil_graphs/oilprice1869.gif">graph</a> of oil prices in real terms (2004$) from 1869 to 2004.  Real oil prices fell from $70 a barrel in 1869 to an average prices less than $20 with the price being $62 a barrel during the late 1970’s and early 1980’s, which has been attributed to the Iran/Iraq War.  The recent Middle East mess was part of the reason why real oil prices reached $72.50 (yes, a historical record even in inflation-adjusted terms).  The recent decline in oil and gasoline prices is neither a surprise nor attributable to government policies of this Administration.  </p>
<p>But let’s turn to what Senator Allen is suggesting.  Is his first proposal suggesting we build a strategic reserve and use it to smooth the volatility in oil prices?  I suspect Al Gore will like this idea – even if George W. Bush hammered the Vice President in 2000 when he made a similar suggestion.  His other proposal seems to be the use of government subsidies to encourage development of alternative energy sources.  Democrats might be saying – welcome to the club. </p>
<p>But why does Mr. Conda think this dip in prices enhances the chances for more conservation and greater use of energy sources?  Lower prices tend to increase quantity demand and reduce quantity supplied.  Conda seems to be making a political argument as he hammers Democrats for making similar arguments.  Democrats who advocate government subsidies to lower gasoline prices should be hammered.  This Democrat, however, is hoping that high oil prices and market forces will work in the long-run to encourage sources of energy supply as they encourage conservation.  On this score, I see very little attractive in this Macaca proposal.</p>
