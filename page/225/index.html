                                <p>by <strong>Mike Kimel</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=387">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>The inimitable TBogg has <a href="http://tbogg.firedoglake.com/2011/03/04/galt-the-musical/">a clip from the upcoming movie Atlas Shrugs, Part 1</a>.    The book is so long and so interminable that the movie has to be done in three pieces.  </p>
<p>The clip has to be seen &#8211; words don&#8217;t do it justice.  And while at TBogg&#8217;s there &#8211; read the comments readers left behind.  Some of them are hilarious.  In any case, the clip apparently inspired TBogg to search out more information, and he located <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2011/03/04/10-questions-with-the-producer-of-atlas-shrugged-john-aglialoro/print/">an interview with John Aglialoro</a>, the producer of the movie:  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote><bold>6. Have you decided how you’ll tackle John Galt’s epic speech in part three?</bold><br />Well, I’m looking at a number of different things. Having John Galt give that speech, it might be in a casino environment. It might be that he is at a mountain retreat, rather than being where he is captured, not…that violent scene at the end. But we’re going to take a look. It doesn’t have to copy just that.</p>
<p>No, it absolutely will be a concentrate of entertaining words with a total, philosophic…But, you know, part three could be a musical…like a Les Miserables kind of a musical. That’s part of the impact and I guess I haven’t said this publicly yet, but I’m looking at it completely different if part three is a musical with quality music that’s done in a certain way that people will like. I mean, if you saw the play Les Miserable without the music, and then with the music, you may go in there saying, ‘oh hell, I would never want to see that great book in a musical.’ That’s going to shock a lot of people to see part three be a musical, and part two may be very different from part three and very different from part one. It has to be new, you know…We get a freshness, a vitality about it, and yet it has the same, rock-solid principles and philosophies that we all know and love.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which apparently provided TBogg with further inspiration &#8211; in a later post he <a href="http://tbogg.firedoglake.com/2011/03/06/john-galts-lonesome-libertarian-lament/">tries to write out some music for part 3</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am the very model of a modern major industrialist<br />You people call me selfish, but I prefer ‘objectivist”<br />The looters and the moochers, they try to take what’s mine<br />To share my genius with others, I’m afraid I must decline</p>
<p>I’m very well acquainted, too, with things that should be taxable<br />But I will not pay my fair share and on this I am intractable<br />Push me just a bit too far and I’ll head to Gulch of Galt<br />Your world will start to fall apart and it will be your fault</p>
<p>[chorus]<br />Your world will start to fall apart and it will be your fault<br />He’s packing up his bags and he’s going to Gulch of Galt<br />You people are annoying and it’s harshing his gestalt</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of the song is just as good and worth a trip to TBogg&#8217;s place to read in full.</p>

                                <p>In order to make this timely I am cut and pasting a note from CEPR pointing to the efficacy of cutting spending in the Social Security through means testing.  The MSM and politicians have proposed this and raising the retirement age as answers to &#8216;the deficit&#8217; crisis, some commenters indicating a &#8216;tipping point&#8217; of disaster soon to come and saying Social Security needs to be a focus of this move to prevent disaster.</p>
<p>Such answers can be examined one by one in this particular forum since luckily the format can offer respite from the political power plays of the moment and posturing from &#8216;friend and foe&#8217; alike.  Since means testing is in the media, let&#8217;s look at the numbers.  Please read the 14 page document first, and then come back with comments.  I apologize for not commenting in particular on the topic but cannot today.</p>
<blockquote><p>Means testing, or reducing Social Security payments to affluent beneficiaries, has been touted as an effective way to reduce the cost of the program. A new report from the <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&#038;c=nvTz3lUs%2FuMeXQcr93C%2B%2FKgHg0QIt0ep"><u>Center for Economic and Policy Research</u></a> (CEPR) examines the feasibility of several different means testing scenarios and finds the potential savings to be rather limited.
<p>“The majority of Social Security beneficiaries are lower- to middle- income people,” said <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&#038;c=j4E2XVPaUKAo6H6aXlpxWqgHg0QIt0ep"><u>Dean Baker</u></a>, an author of the paper and a co-director at CEPR. “The number of beneficiaries who are by most standards considered affluent is too small to raise a significant amount of money via means testing.”</p>
<p>The report, “<a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&#038;c=4Dx9PX2Ta1EyOZQL9bYVcTCOyIZMetHM"><u>The Potential Savings to Social Security from Means Testing</u></a>,” first describes the distribution of Social Security benefits by income level. <a name="more"></a> The authors then look at the effects of phasing out benefits at rates of 10 and 20 percent of every dollar of non-Social Security income above $40,000 or $100,000 and find little in the way of potential savings to Social Security. The savings are even less when behavioral responses in the form of tax avoidance or tax evasion are factored in, since a means test would effectively be an increase in the marginal tax rate for wealthier seniors.    </p>
<p>The data show that over 75 percent of social security benefits go to individuals with non-Social Security income of less than $20,000 and 90 percent goes to those with non-Social Security income of less than $40,000 a year as of 2009. If means testing that phased out benefits at 10 percent were applied to those who make $100,000 a year and assuming no change in behavior, it would only save Social Security 0.74 percent of its outlays. At a 20 percent rate, this would only yield savings equal to1.33 percent of costs. If the phase out were dropped down to $40,000, hardly wealthy by any standard, the overall savings would just be 2.77 percent of costs at the 10 percent rate and only 4.65 percent of costs at the 20 percent rate. Accounting for behavioral responses would lead to even smaller savings, could cut these potential savings by half or more.   </p>
<p>Mean testing would also raise the cost of the program. The retirement program currently has very low costs. If the administrative expenses rose to the level of the disability portion of the Social Security program, the higher costs would likely exceed any savings from a means test.</p>
<p>On net, a means test would appear to be a dubious way to reduce the cost of Social Security.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Premier Wen Jiabao made stabilizing prices <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-05/china-targets-8-growth-this-year-wen-pledges-to-decisively-curb-prices.html">China&#8217;s top economic priority </a>for 2011. Amid the surge in world energy costs, this story didn&#8217;t make the front page. However, Chinese policymakers did take their time spent out of the limelight to allow the Chinese yuan to appreciate roughly 0.3% against the US dollar.</p>
<p>Chinese inflation is elevated and near 5% (<a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/98505/7311989.html">4.9% is the official rate </a>as of January 2011). I understand that China&#8217;s growth adjustment <a href="http://www.economist.com/economics/by-invitation/guest-contributions/world_must_give_china_time_adjust">will take time</a>; but if you&#8217;ve got unwanted inflation, then domestic policy is too loose (fiscal or monetary). And in this case, it&#8217;s the monetary policy that&#8217;s too loose &#8211; that goes for both currency and rates policies.</p>
<p>On the rates front: there&#8217;s a very frothy feel in domestic asset markets, specifically the property market. Low rates and easy money have sparked a(nother) property boom in China, one that policymakers are trying to tamp down. The <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18250463?story_id=18250463&#038;CFID=158278198&#038;CFTOKEN=19449521">Economist published a recent article to the point</a>.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s going to take much, much more than raising down payments and reserve requirements to shore up demand for risk assets. I mean, it really doesn&#8217;t take a genius to see that real rates are entirely too low. What&#8217;s the investment strategy here: nominal GDP is expected to grow at a 11% in 2011 (according to Economic Intelligence Unit, no link), while the lending rate <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-08/china-raises-benchmark-one-year-deposit-lending-rates-by-25-basis-points.html">is just 6.06%</a>. There&#8217;s no rocket science here: money&#8217;s entirely too easy and inflationary pressures are there. </p>
<p>Furthermore, deposit rates are too low and capping domestic consumer demand. Rates need to rise.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-93NDQUcvP14/TXZVwQ2fqFI/AAAAAAAADg0/dBVq3JMcAjk/s1600/china_growth.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-93NDQUcvP14/TXZVwQ2fqFI/AAAAAAAADg0/dBVq3JMcAjk/s400/china_growth.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><a name="more"></a><br />On the currency front. Although there&#8217;s been some appreciation in the nominal currency, the yuan,  Chinese policymakers only recently allowed their currency to fluctuate at all (again) on an annual basis (see chart below). Notice how the annual appreciation was near 0% spanning Q3 2009 to Q4 2010 (October). Since the central bank doesn&#8217;t fully sterilize the inflows of foreign currency from export sales, the depressed nominal rate on the yuan feeds through to the economy via inflation.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EJasLGU-SsE/TXZVwMD_DpI/AAAAAAAADgs/4jp9QTph4Vs/s1600/china_exchange_rates.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EJasLGU-SsE/TXZVwMD_DpI/AAAAAAAADgs/4jp9QTph4Vs/s400/china_exchange_rates.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Inflation is rising, which is perking up the Chinese real exchange rate. In January 2011, the trade-weighted real effective exchange rate appreciated at a 4% annual rate (according to the JP Morgan Index). The real exchange rate takes into account the nominal rate plus shifts in the purchasing power of the domestic currency, as measured by relative price fluctuations.</p>
<p>The chart illustrates that the nominal exchange rate is now gaining traction on an annual basis, since the Chinese government halted its movement against the USD in 2009. I suspect that the nominal momentum will continue to grind upward throughout this year in order to temper some of the inflationary impetus coming from outside its borders (like Fed policy). But as I said before, it&#8217;s Chinese policy that&#8217;s too loose at home.</p>
<p>The problem is, that Chinese policymakers want to rein in accommodative policy without raising rates too much because they don&#8217;t want the currency to appreciate markedly and are unable to fully sterilize all the flows. Inflation results.</p>
<p>If Chinese policymakers question how to achieve their top economic priority, price stability, then the answer to this self-induced problem is pretty obvious: significantly raise rates and the value of the currency.</p>

<p>Sixteen year old Wes Leonard made a dramatic last second shot to win a tournament game for Fenville High School in Michigan.</p>
<p>Then he fell on the floor and died from cardiac arrest due to an enlarged heart.</p>
<p>Every year young athletes die during and after games, many in basketball games, many from cardiac arrhythmia . Although the absolute numbers appear to be very small, the tragedy of a young person dying in front of a crowd is almost too much to bear.</p>
<p>So, should every high school athlete, or at least every basketball athlete (the pace of the game is torrid) have an EKG before the season begins? Many sports physicals are done at little or no cost by physicians in the community, but mandatory EKGs would be costly even if done at no charge to the athlete.</p>
<p>Would this be a good use of our resources? Who should decide?</p>
<p>(free advice: If you have a high performance student athlete pay for a thorough physical and have a discussion with the physician on the advisability of an EKG.) </p>

<p><em>Tax policy was demystified in testimony by Galbraith and Bentsen, Jr. Will Congress listen?     <br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Statement by James K. Galbraith, Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr. Chair in Government/Business Relations and Professor of Government, The University of Texas at Austin, and Senior Scholar, Levy Economics Institute, before the Senate Finance Committee, March 8, 2011, hearing on Principles of Efficient Tax Reform.</strong></p>
<p>“Chairman Baucus, Senator Hatch, Members of the Committee, it is an honor for me to appear before you this morning, to discuss the fundamental principles of an efficient tax reform.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Taxes and Deficit</strong>s. Let me begin by noting that the realized budget deficit is an economic outcome, not a policy choice. So long as the economy faces high unemployment, there is no fiscal formula — no combination of tax increases and spending cuts — that can make it go away.</p>
<p>Our present very large budget deficits arise for two reasons. <a name="more"></a> First, because of the collapse of private credit, the decline of employment and activity, and therefore the fall of tax revenues in the slump and recession. This is a problem we share with the whole world, as the International Monetary Fund’s staff has recently shown. Second, in the (almost unique) case of the United States, part of our budget deficit is due to the global role of the dollar and the use by the rest of the world of Treasury bonds as a reserve asset. That they do so — “exorbitant privilege” — is greatly to our advantage.</p>
<p>Neither of these forces can be controlled by cutting spending or raising taxes. One can reduce <em>projected</em> deficits — for future years — by raising future tax rates or cutting programmed spending for those years. But this is an artificial and unreliable exercise. The actual realized deficits in the future will depend on economic performance at that time, and it is economic performance that actually matters, not the deficit or the public debt. Thus tax reform — and spending policy as well, in my view — should properly focus on economic performance and not on deficits.</p>
<p>On the broader question of deficits, I am attaching for your record a brief statement by Trustees, Directors and Fellows of <a href="http://www.epsusa.org/">Economists for Peace and Security</a>, a professional association. It affirms that the US government is not broke, that budget deficits are normal, and that our pressing priorities are related to economic performance. The statement is signed by distinguished economists including Kenneth Arrow, Andrew Brimmer, Robert J. Gordon, and Alan Blinder.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Tax Incentives</strong>. When economists address tax policy, they often speak of “distortions.” The implied claim is that distortions are bad, and should be removed from the tax code as a matter of principle. You will not hear this language from me. To economists, the phrase “tax distortion” generally implies comparison is to a system with a “lump-sum head-tax” — a poll tax — because that is the only kind of tax that cannot be reduced by changing behavior. Yet the poll tax is the most regressive and pernicious tax available. In the real world, practically every other tax is plainly superior to that one.</p>
<p>Tax incentives are therefore an inescapable fact of life. The proper question is: which incentives work best, for which worthy objectives? And how best to reconcile the incentives in the tax code with the other function of taxation, namely the regulation of demand? Let me begin with an example.</p>
<p>In the years 1981 through 1984, I served first as Executive Director of the Joint Economic Committee under Chairman Henry Reuss, and then as Deputy Director under Vice Chairman Lee Hamilton. The Senate Democratic Members were Senators Bentsen, Proxmire, Kennedy and Sarbanes. In 1984, in the Joint Economic Report, we endorsed the Bradley-Kemp Tax Reform Bill. That bill later evolved into the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986">Tax Reform Act of 1986</a>.</p>
<p>The concept of the Tax Reform Act was to promote simplicity and fairness, without changing the overall burden or incidence, by broad income class, of the income tax. The method was to reduce or eliminate many exemptions and deductions, mainly taken by wealthy people, and then to tax the expanded Adjusted Gross Income at a lower marginal rate. The effect was to redistribute tax burdens mainly within upper-income groups, to the benefit of those who had relatively simple earned incomes (a category that had at one time included Bradley, Kemp, and also President Reagan), and to the detriment of many whose incomes were related to tax-favored activity.</p>
<p>President Reagan deserves full credit for adopting the Bradley-Kemp principles, which he did on the recommendation of his Treasury Department after a year of study, intended to delay consideration of the issue past the 1984 election. During that year, the Treasury tax policy office had conducted among other things an analysis of the <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/2011/01/04/value-added-tax-vat-31315/">Value-Added Tax</a>, and had rejected that alternative for reasons that remain, in my view, valid today. Bradley-Kemp achieved an important improvement in tax fairness.</p>
<p>The Tax Reform Act saved the income tax. But in retrospect it had at least two problematic effects.</p>
<p>The first effect — and here I speak broadly of the movement toward lower top marginal tax rates from 1978 through 1986 — was on corporate executive pay. It is probably not accidental that the years after lower marginal income tax rates took hold — along with lower rates on capital gains — saw the CEO pay explosion.</p>
<p>Why? In part, because lower marginal rates reduced the cost to companies of raising post-tax executive pay (just as the high marginal rates had deterred big pay packages in the first place). The new rules made it irresistible for those who controlled CEO pay to reward themselves in this way. Crudely put, companies quit building skyscrapers and their chiefs built themselves mansions instead. Many ills of American corporate governance can be traced to this new age of executive self-dealing.</p>
<p>Second, as a political compromise, the TRA disallowed deduction of consumer interest payments except for mortgages. This led to an inexorable rise in the use of homes as collateral for loans that supported consumer, student, vacation and health-care-related spending, and therefore to the depletion of home equity as an element in the financial security of the middle class. As the process unfolded over time, it helped produce the systematic abuse of mortgage lending that became pandemic in the middle years of the last decade and that produced the financial crisis.</p>
<p>On the whole, there is no reason to believe that the TRA improved economic performance. The aftermath of tax reform saw the market crash of 1987 and then the recession of 1989-91, from which the economy recovered only very slowly. There were no significant increases in private savings as a share in income, nor in work effort. Thus, I do not believe that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 should be viewed today as the single ideal for the tax code going forward. In particular, a new tax reform should not make a virtue of low marginal rates. If higher taxes are needed, one of the best ways would be to impose a new rate or rates on the highest incomes. And tax reform should not aim indiscriminately at existing tax preferences for middle class Americans, some of which serve their purposes well.</p>
<p>For example, the Reagan years invented and the late Clinton years saw major expansion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_Income_Tax_Credit">Earned Income Tax Credit</a>. The EITC stabilizes the incomes of workers in the lowest-paid and hardest jobs, and protects them from unstable employment. It is invisible to employers; therefore it is likely to have little effect on the proffered wage. It is a well-designed and effective program; there is no reason to cut it just to reduce “tax distortions,” and also none to cut it for “deficit-reduction.”</p>
<p>Equally, the home mortgage interest deduction worked for many decades to promote home ownership in stable communities and neighborhoods. It became pathological only when it became the vehicle for all forms of lending, and when mortgage originators took advantage of the law to create massively abusive and fraudulent mortgage instruments, including exploding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjustable-rate_mortgage">ARMS</a>, <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/2011/03/08/ninja-loan-27681/">NINJA loans</a>, liars’ loans, no-doc loans, and the rest. The appropriate solution is not to eliminate the tax preference for a standard 15-to-30 year self-amortizing mortgage with a substantial required down payment. It would be more sensible to write the law so that only that type of plain-vanilla, fully-documented mortgage received tax-deductible status.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Bad and good incentives: the payroll tax and the estate tax.</strong></p>
<p>The payroll tax was increased sharply in 1983 and is the largest direct tax paid by most working people. It tails off, as a proportion of income, for upper-income Americans on account of the cap on earnings, and the fact that non-wage incomes are not subject to the tax. The high payroll tax rates on working people &#8211; yielding revenues which were for many years vastly higher than benefit payments under Social Security &#8211; were partly intended to shield Social Security benefits from pressures to cut them when the baby boomers began to retire. But they were also a way to shift the burden of taxes in general onto labor and away from non-labor income.</p>
<p>The payroll tax penalizes job creation. By extension it fosters the gray economy, welfare-dependency and crime. This was not a serious problem in (say) the late 1990s, when strong credit creation propelled us to full employment. It is a major problem today. That is why a payroll tax holiday, with the federal government holding the Social Security Trust Fund harmless, was a good idea when enacted last year. On the employee side payroll tax relief helps increase household disposable income; on the employer side it helps cash flow and to reduce the cost of job creation. There may be more efficient job-creation incentives — the TJTC comes to mind — but they are also harder to implement.</p>
<p>In the United States, uniquely among nations, about eight percent of all employment is in the non-profit sector. Why? In substantial part, because for over a century we have given wealthy citizens a strong tax incentive to make philanthropic gifts to universities, hospitals, churches, museums, foundations and other not-for-profit organizations, in advance of the grim reaper. This is partly responsible for our broadly excellent employment performance (compared to Europe) over many years. It is partly responsible for the greatness of our universities and hospitals, and for the vibrancy of our religious life. It integrates wealthy Americans back into their communities, helping to foster and strengthen our democracy. It fosters a broad decentralization of important public activities: for example, higher education policy decisions that in other countries are often vested in a single cabinet ministry, are here made by thousands of independent university administrations.</p>
<p>These benefits and advantages are threatened by the campaign against the estate tax, pushed heavily by one group of wealthy citizens, yet opposed by many other wealthy citizens. History and experience support the second group. There is a very strong incentive-based case for an estate tax with a high tax rate, a high level of exemption, and a one-hundred percent deduction for qualified philanthropic contributions.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Simplicity?</strong> A frequent stated concern of tax reformers is how best to simplify the code. One proposal before you would reduce the income tax for most filers and to replace it with a value-added tax. An appeal of this proposal is that it would eliminate many income tax returns. But of course, a large number of lower-income filers use the short form. This is not a complicated document, and to eliminate it does not seem to be a pressing priority in itself.</p>
<p>Yet, eliminating the federal income tax for low-income filers would make state government taxation much harder, since state income taxes are keyed to the federal tax. Meanwhile the proposed VAT would force a major restructuring of state sales taxes, which would have to convert to piggy-back on the VAT at variable rates, depending on the amount of income tax that would have to be replaced. This, in turn, would create new location incentives for business, to the disadvantage of high-tax states. These changes would create impressive challenges for states and localities already in the grip of fiscal crisis.</p>
<p>As a rule, let me urge you to work slowly. Any truly radical reform is likely to have far-reaching effects. They should be studied carefully, and by analysts with a wide range of views. Actions in this area should always be cautious and incremental, and claims of great gains over the existing system should always bear a heavy burden of proof. Things are often not so simple as they seem.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Growth?</strong> Tax reformers often promise that their proposals will favor economic growth. But there is little evidence that this has ever happened in the past. In principle, this should be no surprise. The long-run potential for economic growth depends on the growth rate of our population, the cost of natural resources, technological progress and the rate of business investment. It is very difficult for any tax reform to change these factors materially. Business investment can sometimes be stimulated by tax favors in the short-run, such as the investment tax credit. Sometimes, this is desirable policy. But a one-time increase in investment does not yield a long-term increase in the rate of growth.</p>
<p>Despite the tradition of hype that suffuses this topic, the most any tax law change can reasonably promise is modest improvement in economic conditions in the fairly short run. History also teaches that most of that effect comes from increasing purchasing power when it is too low &#8211; that is, from the Keynesian effect and not the supply-side effects. Tax law changes do not supply magic bullets for financial crises, nor for a period of slow technological innovation or rising costs of energy.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Should we tax capital, labor — or rent?</strong> Is it a good idea to shift the tax burden from high-income to low-income Americans, in the guise of shifting the tax burden from capital to labor, in order to promote “saving and investment”? In particular, will this create new jobs? History say not: we have been shifting this burden for decades with no appreciable effect on savings, investment or jobs.</p>
<p>And there is also no shortage of capital in our economy. As the economist Mason Gaffney wrote in a paper delivered to the National Tax Association in 1978: “The key to making jobs is changing the use and form of capital we already have. Tax preferences for property income, in their present and proposed forms, bias investors against using capital to make jobs, doing more harm than good.”</p>
<p>Economists from Smith to Ricardo to Mill understood that fixed investments, however useful, do not generate many permanent jobs. What creates jobs is the revolving capital that supports payrolls. A tax policy aimed at supporting employment would shift the tax burden away from labor, and off of short-term capital, and place it instead on long-term capital accumulations. If this reduces the investment in fixed capital that is desired for other reasons — in particular, investment with broad public benefits — then that sort of investment should be done by public authority, funded by an infrastructure bank.</p>
<p>Thus as a general rule fixed assets — notably land — should be taxed more heavily than income. The tax on property is a good tax, provided it is designed to fall as heavily as possible on economic rents. This basic argument, going back to Ricardo, remains sensible, for it aims to not-interfere where there is, in fact, no public purpose to interfere with private decision-taking. Payroll taxes and profits taxes do interfere directly with current business decisions. Taxes effectively aimed at economic rent, including land rent and mineral rents, and at “absentee landlords” as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen">Veblen </a>called them, do not. An important question is how best to treat the “quasi-rents” due to new technology and thus the incentives for innovation. These are presently held as long-term capital gains and they tend to escape tax to a very large degree, with the consequence that a small number of successful innovators (and patent holders) have become an oligarchy of never-before-equaled wealth.</p>
<p>The incentive for innovation is an important public policy objective. But it does not require the vast prizes presently available. And it does not require that those prizes escape tax indefinitely. A sensible approach is to tax unrealized capital gains after a certain amount of time has elapsed — perhaps at fates that rise with time — and again subject to a full charitable deduction. In the final analysis — that is to say at death — once again setting the estate tax at a high rate with a high exemption encourages the early transfer of large quasi-rents to independent foundations or other non-profit institutions (universities, hospitals, churches), and into activities consistent with public purpose. I would also favor raising required foundation payout rates, so as to assure that foundations do not last in perpetuity unless they find new donors.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Energy and Carbon.</strong> I have explained why I do not favor substituting a value-added tax for the income tax. It might however be sensible to replace the payroll tax. In view of the oncoming crises of energy security and climate change, a tax on energy or on carbon would make a good substitute for the payroll tax, especially if it were designed to hold working families harmless, while increasing the incentives for conservation facing companies, retirees, and those with non-labor incomes.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Summary.</strong> Tax law serves two broad goals: the regulation of effective demand and the pursuit of public purpose. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was gave us an income tax structure that is viable for the long run. But its purposes are not ours. We face four pressing priorities: to create jobs, to change how we produce and use energy, to restructure our financial sector, and to curtail the pernicious power of a small number of wealthy persons &#8211; our new American oligarchs &#8211; who have taken undue advantage of past tax reforms. A shift of the tax burden away from labor, onto energy, and onto accumulated wealth &#8211; with the philanthropic escape clause &#8211; would help give us back a healthier, more egalitarian, and more democratic society in future years.</p>

<p><strong>FEDERAL SPENDING AND THE RECOVERY</strong>: <strong>A Statement by Directors, Trustees and Fellows of <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/2011/03/08/james-k-galbraith-lloyd-m-bentsen-jr-testify-on-sensible-tax-reform-37981/www.epsusa.org">Economists for Peace and Security</a>, February 28, 2011.</strong></p>
<p>The budget adopted by the House of Representatives on February 19, 2011 does not make economic sense and is likely to do more harm than good. First, the rationale for the measure is based on a false premise. Secondly, the budget cuts being proposed will impede and may end the recovery. If the recovery fails, unemployment will increase and the financial crisis could re-emerge.</p>
<p>The premise that the US government is broke is false. The US government has never defaulted and will not default on any of its financial obligations. Deficit spending is normal for a great industrial nation with a managed currency, and it has been our normal economic condition throughout the past century. History proves, and sensible economic theory confirms, that in recessions, increased federal spending — not balancing the budget — is the tried and true way to return to a path of sustained growth and high employment.</p>
<p>Eliminating waste in government spending is desirable. But that is not what the House proposes; indeed the House budget failed to address the largest waste in federal government, namely in the military, and the House failed to remove our most egregious subsidies, such as to oil companies. To adopt a policy of deep budget cuts at this stage of recovery is to surrender to irrational fears in the service of a political, not an economic, agenda.</p>
<p>As economists, as citizens, and as long-time critics of waste in government, we call on the Senate to reject the House proposal and to craft an alternative that places first priority on sustaining economic recovery and on dealing with the country’s true economic and social problems, which include unemployment, home foreclosures, the fiscal crisis of states and cities, our infrastructure needs, energy security and climate change.”</p>

<p>We tax profs have a tendency to tell our colleagues that tax law should be a mandatory topic for all law students because there&#8217;s nothing that you do that has economic consequences for which tax law isn&#8217;t relevant.  Whether you are marrying or divorcing, having a baby or buying a home, there are tax considerations that you should know about.  If you are starting a business, depositing the proceeds of a theft in a bank, embezzling or gambling, there are tax considerations that you should know about.  If you are filing a tort action, there are tax ramifications.  If you own property, there are tax consequences.  If you work and earn a salary, there are tax consequences.  If you find a diamond in the street and keep it, there are tax considerations.  If  you get an &#8220;extreme makeover&#8221; home, there are tax consequences.  If your home is rented by tourists in town to see the Master&#8217;s Golf tourney, the tax consequences will vary tremendously if the tenants are there for only 10 days versus if they are there for three weeks, even if you live in the house every other day of the year.  And on and on.</p>
<p>Ted Seto, a tax prof at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, noted another interesting fact about tax law that relates to this claim.  He notes that many of the important laws in other fields that we tend to think of as just a part of the common law had their origins in&#8211;you guessed it&#8211;tax law.  The following is quoted with his permission:  <a name="more"></a> </p>
<p>
<blockquote>The<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_in_Shelley's_Case"> Rule in Shelley&#8217;s Case </a>was an anti-tax-avoidance rule. So was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_of_worthier_title">Doctrine of Worthier Title</a>. So was <a href="http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/30781/Quia-Emptores-Statute-of-as-discussed-in-Statutes-of-Westminster-England-1275-1285-1290">quia emptores terrarum</a>, the statute that, by accident, created modern Anglo-American property in the first place. And the <a href="http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/magna-carta.htm">Magna Carta</a>, which created the beginnings of Anglo-American democracy, was a tax cap agreement (sort of like Prop 13). It&#8217;s all tax, all the way down.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Medical Malpractice Reform: Truth in Advertising Needed (Part Three of Three</strong>)
<p>So in the first two articles we have addressed the historic effects of tort reform using Texas as an example, and subsequently we reviewed the effects of tort reform on so called “defensive medicine” practices, looking at both the effect of reform measures on physician/provider ordering patterns, as well as the possible effects on patient outcomes or mortality.    <br />Today, we are going to examine the last party in this carousel. The insurance agencies themselves. For starters, I wanted to examine if there was any sort of a relationship between malpractice premiums, and healthcare spending. So, using historic healthcare expenditure rates from the NHE database (CMS), I calculated the rate of healthcare growth, percentage wise, per year from 1995-2008. I then used an ISO database set to examine the growth in insurance premiums per year.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l9vhc4U8ScE/TXaVTWtb8BI/AAAAAAAAAjs/QRh9R2vXTQE/s1600/viewer.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l9vhc4U8ScE/TXaVTWtb8BI/AAAAAAAAAjs/QRh9R2vXTQE/s400/viewer.png" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As we can plainly see, there is no correlation, but out of sense of thoroughness, I even ran a simple regression.  <a name="more"></a></p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9gZD3Dgg4cFxt0aG59Z9vY2Ow1di80Vjduouv3M-7jKIxYS0q2eW66B7bKkC-fUbvhGv5h4kfpCgYJYyAPKmHpW2c_ZogzvTwmM5AUgxRcQetUUtYk0" width="523" height="439"><br />But with an R-Squared of 0.021, there is simply little correlation there.     <br />So what causes these random spikes in medical malpractice premiums? Well, according to the AIR (Americans for Insurance Reform) these are due to the economic cycles of insurers and to drops in investment income.     <br />Lastly, I visited this article, <a href="http://www.centerjd.org/air/TrueRiskF.pdf">http://www.centerjd.org/air/TrueRiskF.pdf</a>, which found:</p>
<p>1.     Inflation-adjusted payouts per doctor not only failed to increase between 2001 and 2004, a time when doctors’ premiums skyrocketed, but they have been stable or falling throughout this entire decade.</p>
<p>2.    Medical malpractice insurance premiums rose much faster in the early years of this decade than was justified by insurance payouts.</p>
<p>3.    At no time were recent increases in premiums connected to actual payouts. Rather, they reflected the well-known cyclical phenomenon called a “hard” market. Property/casualty insurance industry “hard” markets have occurred three times in the past 30 years.</p>
<p>4.    During this same period, medical malpractice insurers vastly (and unnecessarily) increased reserves (used for future claims) despite no increase in payouts or any trend suggesting large future payouts. The reserve increases in the years 2001 to 2004 could have accounted for 60</p>
<p>percent of the price increases witnessed by doctors during the period.</p>
<p>But the real devil, the real devil is in the loss ratios…I’m assuming that we are all familiar with the MLR discussions that raged over the past two years discussing what should be an allowable loss ratio for health insurance. Malpractice also has it’s loss ratios, and oh boy, are they favorable to the insurance industry. 61.1% is the average, in 2007, for the average loss ratios for malpractice insurance companies.  To put this another way as per the article: In 2007, medical malpractice insurer profit based just on insurance transactions, that is,just on the premiums they took in, was 24.6%. This was more than double the amount on insurance transactions for the entire industry (11.0%).</p>
<p>If I were a physician who paid my own malpractice, I would be livid over these figures. It is not as though there is a huge advertising market for medical malpractice insurance. 38.9 cents on every dollar are kept as almost pure profit. Surely, administrative costs cannot account for this. Add to this, this last nugget: Inflation-adjusted payouts per doctor not only failed to increase between 2001 and 2004, a time when doctors’ premiums skyrocketed, but they have been stable or falling throughout this entire decade.</p>
<p>It seems, that right now would be a great time to own a malpractice insurance firm. Too bad, that it isn’t so great for everyone else in healthcare.</p>

                                <p>Part of an e-mail from <strong>Beverly Mann</strong> on additional expansion of corporate personhood concept at the Supreme Court:</p>
<p>I agree that, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/03/02/supreme-court-corporations-dont-have-personal-privacy-rights/">as the article at Raw Story says</a>, the decision is a striking contrast to the court&#8217;s ruling in Citizens United, which upended decades of campaign finance regulation, allowing corporations to spend unlimited amounts on political campaigns without having to identify themselves.</p>
<p>Some commentators are amused by the last sentence of the final paragraph of Roberts’ opinion in the case. The paragraph reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>We reject the argument that because “person” is defined for purposes of FOIA to include a corporation, the phrase “personal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) reaches corporations as well. The protection in FOIA against disclosure of law enforcement information on the ground that it would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy does not extend to corporations. We trust that AT&#038;T will not take it personally.</p></blockquote>
<p>The line strikes me as a nod to a hilarious Supreme Court Dispatch article that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2281715/">Dahlia Lithwick wrote in Slate</a>, reporting on the oral argument in the case in January, in which she treated AT&#038;T as an actual human and said “he” was in court that day to watch the argument. </p>
<p>But there’s really no mistaking that Roberts and some of the others are feeling burned by the massive criticism of the Citizens United opinion last year.</p>
