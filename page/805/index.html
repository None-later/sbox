                                <p><a href="http://www.nrdc.org/onearth/07sum/genes1.asp">This article</a> in On Earth marks the beginning of research that might have far reaching consequences in how we view disease and how our consumption is currently involved in creating health problems:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although some diseases are inherited through a single genetic mutation &#8212; cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia are examples &#8212; the classic &#8220;one gene, one disease&#8221; model doesn&#8217;t adequately explain the complex interplay between an individual&#8217;s unique genetic code and his or her personal history of environmental exposures. That fragile web of interactions, when pulled out of alignment, is probably what causes many chronic diseases: cancer, obesity, asthma, heart disease, autism, and Alzheimer&#8217;s, to name just a few. To unravel the underlying biological mechanisms of these seemingly intractable ailments requires that scientists understand the precise molecular dialogue that occurs between our genes and the environment &#8212; where we live and work, what we eat, drink, breathe, and put on our skin. Herbert&#8217;s literature scan was a nod in this direction, but actually teasing out the answers in a laboratory has been well beyond her or anyone else&#8217;s reach &#8212; until now.</p>
<p>The earliest prototype was devised about a decade ago; since then these tiny devices, as well as other molecular investigative tools, have grown exponentially in their sophistication, pushing medical science toward a new frontier.<br />Gene chips are small, often no larger than your typical domino or glass laboratory slide, yet they can hold many thousands of genes at a time. Human genes are synthesized and bound to the surface of the chip such that a single copy of each gene &#8212; up to every gene in an organism&#8217;s entire genome &#8212; is affixed in a grid pattern. The DNA microarray allows scientists to take a molecular snapshot of the activity of every gene in a cell at a given moment in time.</p>
<p>The process works this way: Every cell in your body contains the same DNA, but DNA activity &#8212; or expression &#8212; is different in a liver cell, say, than it is in a lung, brain, or immune cell. Suppose a scientist wishes to analyze the effect of a particular pesticide on gene activity in liver cells. (This makes sense, since it is the liver that processes and purges many toxins from the body.) A researcher would first expose a liver cell culture in a test tube to a precise dose of the chemical. A gene&#8217;s activity is observed through the action of its RNA, molecules that convey the chemical messages issued by DNA. RNA is extracted from the test tube, suspended in a solution, then poured over the gene chip. Any given RNA molecule will latch on only to the specific gene that generated it. The genes on the chip with the most RNA stuck to them are the ones that were most active in the liver cells, or most &#8220;highly expressed.&#8221; The genes that don’t have any RNA stuck to them are said to be &#8220;turned off&#8221; in those cells. Scientists use the micro array to compare the exposed cells to non-exposed, control cells (see sidebar). Those genes that show activity in the exposed cells but not in the control cells, or vice versa, are the ones that may have been most affected by the pesticide exposure.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;a scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), who was then a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland, designed an experiment that included the use of microarrays and other molecular tools to figure out how, exactly, mercury was interfering with both our nervous and immune systems. She grew cells in test tubes &#8212; one set for mouse brain cells, another for mouse liver cells &#8212; and exposed them to various doses of mercury so that she could see which genes were being switched on and off in the presence of the toxic metal. In the brain and the liver cells, she noticed unusual activity in the gene interleukin-6, which both responds to infection and directs the development of neurons.<br />&#8220;We thought we had mercury figured out,&#8221; says Ellen Silbergeld, a professor of environmental health sciences at Johns Hopkins University, who collaborated with Sass on the study. Genomic tools may identify effects of other chemicals by allowing scientists to &#8220;go fishing,&#8221; as Silbergeld puts it, for things they did not know to look for.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>But first, a more fundamental question: Do we even understand what today&#8217;s chronic diseases are? It is beginning to appear that what we call autism may in fact be many illnesses that we&#8217;ve lumped together because those who are afflicted seem to behave similarly. Doctors base their diagnosis on behavioral symptoms, not on what caused those symptoms. Some scientists now refer to the condition as &#8220;autisms,&#8221; acknowledging that we&#8217;ve yet to find a single, unifying biological mechanism, despite the identification, in some studies, of a handful of genes that may confer increased vulnerability. But then, genes or environmental exposures that appear to be important causal factors in one study may not show up at all in another. This leaves scientists to wonder whether the problem isn&#8217;t that the disease is so diverse in its biological origins that only a truly massive study &#8212; involving many thousands of patients &#8212; would have the statistical power to tease apart the various factors involved.</p></blockquote>
<p>Norway has a study going with 100,000 people on the impact of environment on disease symptoms and causes using this genetic array testing. Clinton started a program in 2000 looking at large numbers of Americans and possible causes of disease symptoms, and includes a number of data sets that could be used for more general purposes. Recruiting has not started to date due to funding problems. The UK is also beginning another large, long term study.</p>
<p>I have included mercury levels in unborns as an example of how innovation in diagnostic procedures will allow us to measure what I have called &#8216;subtle toxins&#8217; in the environment not because effects are subtle, but measurement is. Our water contains lots of medications and soluble chemicals, and there are no procedures in place to determine safety to unborns and newborns, small children (under 5).</p>
<p>Our ignorance is not limited to dramatic breakthroughs in technological diagnostics, however.  Some procedures are simply more commonsense.   <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/108/1/197">The American Academy of Pediatricians</a> found that safety levels for mercury blood levels in pregnant women was determined by drawing blood from the mother. Later, it dawned on people to test blood levels from the cortical blood of the fetus, which turned out to average 70% higher levels of mercury than the mothers, and put the fetus way over limits of safety published by EPA.   Mercury is fairly common in the environment.</p>
<p>This sort of research costs money, and if it goes where I think it will go over the next ten years, will create concern.  Does this sort of research deserve funding by government?  Is the initial funding something the current private sector would ever consider?  Beginning results are not expected to be ready until 2011 or later, and final results from these particular studies could carry on for several decades.</p>

                                <p>Michigan is in the 6th year of a 1 year recession. Job losses and record foreclosures continue, and continue, and continue.</p>
<p>As the domestic auto industry falters, George Bush and Nancy Pelosi are willing to toss the Big 3 and the UAW overboard in order to create some sort of global warming legacy.</p>
<p>So what to do?</p>
<p>The political parties in Michigan are likely to cut a deal to abandon the presidential caucus system and go to a January 15th primary.</p>
<p>Rumor is the poo-bahs (both parties) in Washington are not happy, and may call for a candidate boycott of Michigan. The Democrats have to be careful, given the damage of crossing two “D” senators and the UAW.</p>
<p>The early Michigan primary could force New Hampshire and Iowa to adjust again, maybe going into December.</p>
<p>(Lot’s of people are sick of Iowa and NH having disproportionate influence.)</p>
<p>All of this begs for a coherent primary system, which is not likely unless 2008 is a total disaster, which could happen.</p>

                                <p>Consider <a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2007/08/oil-at-100-per-barrel.html">this post</a> from One Salient Oversight:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the market in trouble, Bernanke came to rescue by lowering a key federal funds rate, a process which essentially communicated to the market that the Fed&#8217;s monetary stance is now expansionary. In other words, the Federal Reserve will increase the money supply, thus making money cheaper, with the result being an easing of conditions for the entire marketplace.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>If the US Dollar devalues then the price of oil will go up accordingly. International markets have responded to the Fed&#8217;s lower rates by selling off the US Dollar &#8211; and they will continue this process. With an ever-devaluing US Dollar, the only way is up for the price of oil.</p>
<p>On Thursday last week I predicted that oil would not go over $100. Since then Ben Bernanke has messed up my calculations and basically said to me (and the rest of the world) that the US Dollar is not worth owning at its current price. With a devalued US Dollar now an almost certainty, the chances of oil breaking the $100 mark is now much more likely.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, there&#8217;s a prediction.  And there&#8217;s a lot more at the post.</p>

                                <p>Regular readers know I feed feral and stray cats. (I love all kinds of animals, but cats tend to be the easiest animal to help in a city.) I&#8217;ve had a few instances where I think: <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/random-cat-blogging.html">this was an unqualified success</a>, but for the most part, all I&#8217;m doing is keeping some of these animals alive for a little bit of time, until they get hit by a car, die of exposure, or I can do nothing more for them as a result of a move. Such is life.</p>
<p>But there is a calculus of aid&#8230; time, money, and resources are limited. Which leads to this e-mail sent by reader Cursed:</p>

<p>Ethics, cats, and lizard Gods.</p>
<p>A stray cat wondered into my life, and a terrible calamity befell her recently, which eventually cost her a leg. The vet tried. Poor little kitty peed blood for over a week, endured surgery, a cast, a gangrenous foot, amputation, finally she was required to wear a plastic cone around her neck for ten days to prevent her from chewing the stitches. That came off two days ago.</p>
<p>Now she weebles and wobbles and growls a lot. It looks like she will get used to only one rear leg, but she is not very happy.</p>
<p>Kitty&#8217;s great passion in life was hunting and laps. Her little world was filled with blue bellied lizards. They didn&#8217;t have a chance against Kitty. They&#8217;d often seek safety in the oak trees, but kitty was an intrepid climber. Kitty might have got her foot hung up in a tree and struggled. I&#8217;ll never know for sure.</p>
<p>I wonder if I did the right thing. Next door another stray cat just had a litter of kittens. Their fate is mostly likely a short life. My kitty has suffered greatly the last six weeks, now she looks to the future as a cripple. Should I have just put her out of her misery and rescued a kitten?</p>

<p>If I might add something (and I&#8217;m not a poetry kind of guy, but some poems have stuck to me), here&#8217;s <em>The Red Wheelbarrow</em> by The Red Wheelbarrow by William Carlos Williams&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Each day approximately 84 million barrels of oil are extracted from the earth, and approximately the same amount is consumed. It can be no other way: inventory space is limited, and could not be extended significantly by “excess production” or indeed drawn down for long by “excess demand”.</p></blockquote>
<p>This comes in response to a quote from the <em>Economist</em> which states that&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The world is consuming more oil than it is producing</p></blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>Sometimes a bit of reframing makes a difference.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/016770.php">Steve Benen</a> catches <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070817/ap_on_el_pr/giuliani_family;_ylt=Am0Gj2rCq5fuO0QFPgg7XPus0NUE">Rudy Giuliani</a> babbling some gibberish about Social Security:</p>
<blockquote><p>Giuliani stressed his desire to have private forces shape the country&#8217;s economy in education as well as in health care and Social Security. He said he supported President Bush&#8217;s unsuccessful proposal to allow people to invest some of their Social Security taxes in private accounts. &#8220;I would have preferred, over my lifetime, if I could have invested some of that Social Security money myself,&#8221; said Giuliani, 63. &#8220;I think I would have done much better than the government did. I believe young people today, a lot of them feel that way. I think people who want a private option should be entitled to have it.&#8221; He said people who want traditional Social Security with no private accounts should be allowed to have that, too. And he allowed that the issue &#8220;is going to have to be compromised out&#8221; because Democrats who control Congress oppose it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does Giuliani wish he had put down a ton of funds into the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=%5EGSPC&#038;t=3m&#038;l=on&#038;z=m&#038;q=l&#038;c=">S&#038;P 500</a> a month ago?  OK, the expected return to stocks may be higher than the risk-free rate but that’s only because of the risk premium.  And I’m sure Giuliani balanced the expected return of his portfolio against the risks with all due consideration that his portion of the Social Security retirement fund was in risk-free government bonds.  Most rational people do.  Or is Giuliani as dumb as George W. Bush was falling for the Cato free lunch fallacy.  </p>
<p>Steve thinks Giuliani is making a big political mistake by signing onto the Bush Social Security agenda:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even the most sycophantic of Republicans quickly realized that Bush&#8217;s Social Security policy was poison to be avoided at all costs. Given the public&#8217;s response, a candidate would have to be a blithering fool to embrace a plan that everyone loathed.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, but is Giuliani any more clear on his Social Security stance than he is on his pro-choice chance.  After all, he says he is for anti-Roe judges but he is also for a woman’s right to choose.  And here, he is for the current system as well as what Bush wants.  Confused as to where Rudy stands?  I am.  But then isn’t the whole point of his campaign – he’s for everything.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>While searching for time series data on religiosity in the United States, I stumbled on <a href="http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.html">this article</a> entitled <em><strong>Cross-National Correlations of Quantifiable Societal Health with Popular Religiosity and Secularism in the Prosperous Democracies</strong></em> in the <em>Journal of Religion and Society</em>.  I wasn&#8217;t familiar with the journal, but to someone as ignorant about the topic as I, its a fascinating article with some fascinating graphs toward the end.  (I would have cut out and posted a few but couldn&#8217;t figure out how.)  And since it touches on some themes I&#8217;ve looked at in my <em>Comparing Presidents</em> series, I figured it was worth commenting on here.  Anyway, some exerpts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Among the developed democracies absolute belief in God, attendance of religious services and Bible literalism vary over a dozenfold, atheists and agnostics five fold, prayer rates fourfold, and acceptance of evolution almost twofold. Japan, Scandinavia, and France are the most secular nations in the west, the United States is the only prosperous first world nation to retain rates of religiosity otherwise limited to the second and third worlds&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>Correlations between popular acceptance of human evolution and belief in and worship of a creator and Bible literalism are negative (Figure 1). The least religious nation, Japan, exhibits the highest agreement with the scientific theory, the lowest level of acceptance is found in the most religious developed democracy, the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>Despite a significant decline from a recent peak in the 1980s (Rosenfeld), the U.S. is the only prosperous democracy that retains high homicide rates, making it a strong outlier in this regard (Beeghley; Doyle, 2000). Similarly, theistic Portugal also has rates of homicides well above the secular developed democracy norm. Mass student murders in schools are rare, and have subsided somewhat since the 1990s, but the U.S. has experienced many more (National School Safety Center) than all the secular developed democracies combined.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>The positive correlation between pro-theistic factors and juvenile mortality is remarkable, especially regarding absolute belief, and even prayer (Figure 4). Life spans tend to decrease as rates of religiosity rise (Figure 5), especially as a function of absolute belief. Denmark is the only exception. Unlike questionable small-scale epidemiological studies by Harris et al. and Koenig and Larson, higher rates of religious affiliation, attendance, and prayer do not result in lower juvenile-adult mortality rates on a cross-national basis.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>Although the late twentieth century STD epidemic has been curtailed in all prosperous democracies (Aral and Holmes; Panchaud et al.), rates of adolescent gonorrhea infection remain six to three hundred times higher in the U.S. than in less theistic, pro-evolution secular developed democracies (Figure 6). At all ages levels are higher in the U.S., albeit by less dramatic amounts. The U.S. also suffers from uniquely high adolescent and adult syphilis infection rates, which are starting to rise again as the microbe’s resistance increases (Figure 7). The two main curable STDs have been nearly eliminated in strongly secular Scandinavia. Increasing adolescent abortion rates show positive correlation with increasing belief and worship of a creator, and negative correlation with increasing non-theism and acceptance of evolution; again rates are uniquely high in the U.S. (Figure 8). Claims that secular cultures aggravate abortion rates (John Paul II) are therefore contradicted by the quantitative data. Early adolescent pregnancy and birth have dropped in the developed democracies (Abma et al.; Singh and Darroch), but rates are two to dozens of times higher in the U.S. where the decline has been more modest (Figure 9). Broad correlations between decreasing theism and increasing pregnancy and birth are present, with Austria and especially Ireland being partial exceptions. Darroch et al. found that age of first intercourse, number of sexual partners and similar issues among teens do not exhibit wide disparity or a consistent pattern among the prosperous democracies they sampled, including the U.S. A detailed comparison of sexual practices in France and the U.S. observed little difference except that the French tend &#8211; contrary to common impression &#8211; to be somewhat more conservative (Gagnon et al.).</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies (Figures 1-9). The most theistic prosperous democracy, the U.S., is exceptional, but not in the manner Franklin predicted. The United States is almost always the most dysfunctional of the developed democracies, sometimes spectacularly so, and almost always scores poorly. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>No democracy is known to have combined strong religiosity and popular denial of evolution with high rates of societal health. Higher rates of non-theism and acceptance of human evolution usually correlate with lower rates of dysfunction, and the least theistic nations are usually the least dysfunctional. None of the strongly secularized, pro-evolution democracies is experiencing high levels of measurable dysfunction.</p></blockquote>
<p>In my series on Presidents, I noted that in many instances, outcomes matching the values of those who vote Republican (both in terms of social values (e.g., abortions, marriage rates, etc.) and most economic values) were more likely to be achieved under Democratic Presidents.  So this next item was especially interesting to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, the data examined in this study demonstrates that only the more secular, pro-evolution democracies have, for the first time in history, come closest to achieving practical “cultures of life” that feature low rates of lethal crime, juvenile-adult mortality, sex related dysfunction, and even abortion.  The least theistic secular developed democracies such as Japan, France, and Scandinavia have been most successful in these regards. The non-religious, pro-evolution democracies contradict the dictum that a society cannot enjoy good conditions unless most citizens ardently believe in a moral creator. The widely held fear that a Godless citizenry must experience societal disaster is therefore refuted. Contradicting these conclusions requires demonstrating a positive link between theism and societal conditions in the first world with a similarly large body of data &#8211; a doubtful possibility in view of the observable trends.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should also note&#8230; countries used in the survey were:  Australia, Canada, Denmark, Great Britain, France, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Japan, Switzerland, Norway, Portugal, Austria, Spain, Italy, United States, Sweden, and New Zealand.</p>

                                <p>For those yammering on about how we have to stay in Iraq to &#8220;fight them there so we don&#8217;t fight them here&#8221; despite the fact that what is going on &#8220;over there&#8221; is a multi-sided Civil War in which we are arming several sides, all of whom would happily use those weapons against US troops should the opportunity arise, let me share a few random facts&#8230;</p>
<p>1. On September 20, 1066, invading Norwegian forces under King Harald III defeated the armies of two English Earls at the Battle of Fulford. For a while, it looked like Harald might take over England.<br />2. On September 25, 1066, after a forced march, King Harold (of England) surprised King Harald (of Norway), destroying the unprepared invading forces at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.<br />3. On September 28, 1066, William of Normandy arrived with his army and laid claim to the land. Upon hearing the news, Harold, whose forces had not had time to recover from the battle, marched to intercept.<br />4. October 14, 1066, Harold&#8217;s forces caught up with William and were beaten at the Battle of Hastings. William, of course, became known as William the Conqueror.</p>
<p>A few comments&#8230; Harald&#8217;s defeat to Harold may have been partly due to the efforts associated with victory five days earlier. Similarly, Harold&#8217;s defeat to William may well be partly attributable to the earlier battle between Harold and Harald.</p>
<p>So to the belligerent folks who see enemies all around and who insist that there is something going on in Iraq that is worth the blood and treasure being expended&#8230; I suggest reading <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,2147052,00.html">this story</a> and <br /><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070817/ap_on_re_eu/russia_bombers;_ylt=AlsU3vHe4FAoaf6_WQ9PWPus0NUE">this story</a>. And then ask yourself&#8230; how much of a threat are the various sides in the Iraqi Civil War to us after all?</p>

                                <p>This post is on energy – it looks at energy independence and the price of a gallon of gasoline over time. Data used in the post includes figures for <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/stb0101.xls">energy consumption and energy production</a> and <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/stb0524.xls">the real (year 2000) price of a gallon of gasoline</a>. For gasoline, I use the price of leaded gasoline until 1976, and unleaded thereafter. (However, for changes over the length of Jimmy Carter’s term, I use the change from the 1976 price of a gallon of unleaded to the 1980 price of a gallon of unleaded to maintain consistency.) </p>
<p>(Regular readers may recall I once took a similar look at the topic, but that was before I knew how to put a graph up on blogger so this seemed a good excuse to revisit it.</p>
<p>OK. Some graphs.</p>

<p>First, in terms of what it means – the price of a gallon of gas… the biggest spike occurred during the Carter admin, as a result of the Oil Embargo. Result… Carter got off his butt, and was also the president who did the best job at moving the country in the direction of energy independence. The next biggest annualized jump in the price of gasoline took place under GW, but he hasn’t exactly been Mr. Energy Independence. In terms of gasoline price hikes, he was followed (distantly) by Clinton, who was also no great prize when it came to making the country self-reliant, though arguably, at least in Clinton’s administration, one could argue people had an easier time <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/this-post-looks-at-disposable-income-by.html">affording</a> the gasoline price hikes.</p>
<p>The biggest decrease in the price of gasoline came during the Reagan admin – courtesy of the end of the Oil Embargo. Interestingly enough, the big price drop in the Reagan admin happened in 1986. What happened in 1986? Accessing &#8230; accessing&#8230; here it is: in 1986, the US supplied Iran with several plane loads of missiles and other assorted military equipment, plus a cake shaped like a key, and for good measure, a bible shaped like a bible. (In fairness, I believe Ollie North denies the cake and bible part of the story, but I&#8217;ll leave it to you to decide if anyone associated with supplying weaponry to Iran in violation of the National Security Act is credible about any part of the Iran Contra affair &#8211; especially someone who shredded every bit of evidence he could.) Who said a President can’t affect the price of gasoline?</p>
<p>In theory, GW&#8217;s approach is similar to Reagan&#8217;s, as he&#8217;s now <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/disappearing-weaponry.html">providing an enemy with weapons</a>, and <a href="http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&#038;um=1&#038;hl=en&#038;q=bush+prince+abdullah">ingratiating himself with Middle Eastern despot who wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing the US destroyed</a>, but it hasn&#8217;t yielded the same results&#8230;</p>
<p>Next post in this series&#8230; Religion.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Update&#8230;.</p>
<p>It seems that Iran-Contra occuring the year of the price drop is just a coincidence, or at least I should note that Iran <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/mi...ld/iran/%20oil.htm">did not increase output</a> that year.</p>
