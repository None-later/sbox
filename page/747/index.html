Worse, the erroneous and/or misleading information about economic issues affects the rest of us here, because many of that magazine&#8217;s readers endlessly repeat the tripe they read at that magazine, and vote accordingly. </p>

<blockquote><p>The American economy appears to have created far fewer jobs this spring than has been reported so far, a new government report indicated yesterday. That could provide further impetus for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates when it meets Dec. 11.</p>
<p>The report included a sharp downward revision of the government’s estimate of personal income growth for the second quarter. Because the changes were made as soon as better employment figures were available, the revisions made it seem likely that figures on job creation are also likely to be revised downward in coming months.</p>
<p>The new report concluded that personal income from wages and salaries grew at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second quarter, far below the 4.5 percent that had previously been estimated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, some of us have been wondering for a while whether the data on employment was making any sense for a while.  How long before the cheerleaders stop touting the fabulous job market situation?</p>

                                <p>This is the second of two posts sent to me this morning by readers with very big ideas.  This one is by OldVet&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>“Currency Values – time for a change?>/span><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1QDFb04KfI/AAAAAAAAA4w/qzl8efPKhbg/s1600-R/OldVet+-+Man+With+Money.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1QDFb04KfI/AAAAAAAAA4w/H2ItXA-pyDM/s320/OldVet+-+Man+With+Money.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />“Here, I have some US Dollars.  Can I leave the tip?”</p>
<p>As you may know, I’m personally agnostic on the value of the Dollar, except as it affects the real economy of the US .  The Bush administrations’ economic jokesters, led by Secretary of the Treasury Mr. Paulson, have a set of comedy routines.   The most entertaining routine could be described as the &#8220;falling dollar Not-My-Baby.&#8221; Bush and Paulson preach the all too familiar mantra “a strong dollar is in our national interest.”  I heard one high potentate of finance opine that nobody ever “devalued their way to prosperity.”  Oh, really?  Ever heard of China ?  How about OPEC, who effectively devalue their currencies by pricing Oil in Dollars (until recently.)  They addicted the whole world to their exports and got rich in the process. Who are you kidding, Washington ? </p>
<p>The US Dollar used to be a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/campaigns/eunion/cesterling.xml">small fraction</a> of the English Pound when Britain ruled the waves.  Now it takes only two Dollars to buy a Pound,  and during this time America became enormously prosperous.  So did Britain , whose currency lost relative value.</p>
<p>Which leads us the value of the Dollar.  We’ve run approximately 30 years of continuous trade deficits, meaning more consumption than production taking place.  We issue IOU’s by the bushel basket.  We claim that “deficits don’t matter” or that “deficits are a sign of economic strength.”  Here’s a different theory:  Deficits are paid for with borrowing, and that borrowing represents claims on US tax revenues and claims on hard assets in the US such as land or factories.  Continuous deficits are signs of an unhealthy addiction to the high life, and growing credit creation leads to a “Minsky Moment” which was the economist Minsky’s observation that credit expansions lead to excess and then collapse.</p>
<p>There is one avid group of traders and thinkers who believe that only the use of a “gold standard” as the basis for the US currency will stabilize trade deficits and credit creation.  Their idea is that the Fed and Treasury cannot create more Dollars than are warranted by our stock of gold in Fort Knox to back them up.  ( Russia has added massive amounts of Gold to its official government reserves.)  That is considered an absolute standard, such as we had till 1972 with the Breton Woods introduction of a floating currency regime in the world, such that governments no longer used Gold as their currency basis.  Then there was a modification called, informally, Breton Woods II.  Today we have massive one way trade imbalances between the US and much of the rest of the world.  That is especially true of the world which “pegs” or fixes in some manner their own currencies to the US dollar.  Like the GCC, China , and other countries officially, and via artificially low interest rates also Japan.</p>
<p>A modest proposition:  How about rather than an absolute standard like Gold to establish currency value, we use GDP and GDP growth rates?  Official monetary expansion would be limited to GDP growth and enough to cover inflation.  That would base our currency on our productivity, rather than our consumption or something dug out of the ground.  Or we insist that floating market rates determine the value of all currencies against the US dollar, to establish a market price; or no trade takes place until it does, or tariffs make up the difference in estimated value.  In other words, a little tough love.</p>
<p>How about a few other ideas to help out Washington?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This one was by OldVet.  </p>
<p>My very quick thought&#8230;  I&#8217;m a little confused about how this would work.  The gold standard worked because there was an underlying item&#8230; an ounce of gold.  GDP (or real GDP) is not something that can be bought or sold.  And the value of the dollar only makes sense in the context of &#8220;relative to other currencies.&#8221;  If other currencies are free to move against the dollar, is there really a peg?  </p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This morning I found two very far out proposals in my mail box.  Here&#8217;s the first of them.  It was written up at One Salient Oversight&#8217;s place, and with his permission, I&#8217;m reprinting the whole thing.  I don&#8217;t have time to insert the links, so if you want them, you&#8217;ll have to go <a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2007/12/zero-tax-economic-system.html">his site</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s his post&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Over the years I have come up with some crazy ideas and schemes. Every time I do, however, I discover that someone has been there first. I came up with the idea of a Democratic system of government that selects politicians randomly and without the need for political parties and elections, but then discovered that someone else had come up with it first. I invented the Zero Unemployment Economic System but then found out that I had simply come up with a Socialist version of Milton Friedman&#8217;s Negative Income Tax theory. As yet I have yet to find anyone advocating my idea for Absolute Price Stability before I did.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve come up with something else &#8211; the Zero Tax Economic System. It&#8217;s been running around in my mind for about 5-6 years now, but the reason why I never published anything about it was simply because I had no faith that it would work. To be honest with you, I&#8217;m still not certain that it would work, so if you do find holes in it I won&#8217;t get too embarrassed.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m publishing it now is due to some conversations I&#8217;ve had with a friend over the nature of the Monetary system and recent stuff I have read about SIMPOL and their ideas of monetary reform. As a result of my thinking through this, I have come to understand a bit more about Fractional-reserve Banking, as well as the Reserve requirement that has sometimes been used as part of a central bank&#8217;s Open market operations.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, here is my idea:</p>
<p>   1. All taxes are removed &#8211; income tax, sales tax, company tax&#8230; everything.<br />   2. The government creates the money it needs via seigniorage (printing money).<br />   3. The Central bank then controls inflation by increasing the Reserve requirement of bank deposits (on M2 and maybe M3).</p>
<p>Simple isn&#8217;t it? In years gone by it was my understanding that when a central bank intervened in the marketplace it either issued bonds or paid them back. I wasn&#8217;t really aware of the Reserve requirement &#8211; the percentage of deposits that banks must hold at the central bank &#8211; or any other tools of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Of course the idea of a government simply printing the money it needs without worrying about tax intake is hardly new. Everyone with a smidgeon of economic understanding knows that this sort of activity leads to the &#8220;H&#8221; word &#8211; Hyperinflation. Suddenly everyone then becomes an expert in the history of Weimar Germany (although Zimbabwe is another good place to start these days).</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m suggesting, though, won&#8217;t result in hyperinflation. This is because I still have faith in the ability of Monetary policy and Central banks to recognise inflation and to act accordingly (except, most saliently, the current US Federal Reserve Bank board, who obviously need Paul Volcker to be chairman again). The complete removal of all forms of taxation, followed by wholesale money creation, would inject massive amounts of money into the economy. But for every dollar, or pound or Euro or Yuan that is created, the central bank can remove by increasing the Reserve requirement for bank deposits. This balancing act will remove the hyperinflationary effect.</p>
<p>I can see three benefits of this system.</p>
<p>The first benefit is efficiency. Without the need to collect tax, entire government departments can be eliminated, removing the need for a massive bureaucracy to maintain the government&#8217;s tax revenue. Instead, the government simply gets the money created by the central bank. This efficiency would also be felt in the private sector, with no tax accountants and lawyers required by companies and corporations. Obviously some level of unemployment would occur as accountants and lawyers and bean counters look for work, but that would be easily solved over time. With less time spent on adhering to tax laws and finding loopholes, the economy will benefit.</p>
<p>The second benefit is that government revenue is indirectly raised from the broadest possible base. This proposed system does not really create money from nothing &#8211; the raising of the Reserve requirement of bank deposits balances out the seigniorage. This means, in effect, that the tax burden is still there &#8211; it&#8217;s just that it has transferred into the marketplace in the form of higher market interest rates, which affects the entire economy.</p>
<p>The third benefit of this system is that it accommodates those who wish for &#8220;small&#8221; government as well as those who want the government to have a larger role in the economy. Obviously the amount of money the government spends will determine how high the reserve requirement of bank deposits becomes &#8211; the smaller the government, the lower the reserve requirement will be and the larger the place the free market has; the larger the government, the higher the reserve requirement will be and the free market will have a smaller place in the overall economy. Put simply, this zero-tax economic system can work for both conservative and progressive sides of politics. In the end, the argument between these two political sides will no longer be about government revenue and taxation, but government spending and market interest rates.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve had other economic ideas, how would this idea fit in with my other models &#8211; the Zero Unemployment Economic System (ZUES) and Absolute Price Stability?</p>
<p>With ZUES, all that would happen is that each employed person would continue to receive two incomes &#8211; one income from his/her employer (which has no minimum wage requirements) and the universal income from the government that all people would receive equally (which is a form of negative income tax). But rather than this universal income being sourced from higher levels of tax revenue, the income is merely created by seigniorage, with the amount determined by formula. The central bank then modifies the Reserve requirement to control inflation.</p>
<p>With Absolute Price Stability, the Central bank would set the Reserve requirement at such a level as to keep inflation at zero. Moreover, I would argue that banks should not get any interest paid at all on these reserves by the central bank which, in a zero-inflation environment, means that banks would neither directly gain nor directly lose from having to keep money under the central bank bed.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>This one was by One Salient Oversight.   Its early and I&#8217;m on the run, so I don&#8217;t have time to give it the treatment it deserves.  A few random thoughts:</p>
<p>1.  Government spending in 2006 was over 20% of GDP.  Can that be funded simply by printing money?  And if not, can government spending could be shrunk enough for it to be funded entirely this way?<br />2.  Fiddling with the money multiplier does affect the money supply (and hence, inflation), but its small potatoes relative to open market operations (the Fed buying and selling bonds).  Will it be enough?<br />3.  Banks make their money by loaning out money.  One Salient Oversight&#8217;s plan wouldn&#8217;t necessarily create funds out of thin air &#8211; some of those funds would come from reduced profits that the current system creates (out of thin air) for the banks.  Will the banks agree to it?   And if not, can they be forced into it?  After all, banks are powerful enough, politically, to get bail outs when they do incredibly stupid things?<br />4.  As much as they say they&#8217;re for tax simplification, I just don&#8217;t see the big accounting and tax law firms agreeing to something like this, and they&#8217;re pretty powerful entities too.</p>
<p>Anyway, your thoughts?</p>

                                <p>There really isn&#8217;t much of a way to enforce arms control treaties&#8230; except by maintaining goodwill among the nations that sign them. If one party gets a reputation for breaking or pulling out of treaties, eventually the other party realizes there isn&#8217;t much benefit to not doing the same. All you need is one bad actor <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/01/MNDDTM7PH.DTL">and it all falls apart</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Vladimir Putin signed a law Friday suspending Russia&#8217;s participation in a major conventional arms treaty that had limited NATO and Russian military deployments in Europe.</p>
<p>The Kremlin had been threatening all year to scrap the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe treaty, and on Friday, Putin signed a law passed this month by parliament providing for that step. The suspension takes effect Dec. 12.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Signed in the last days of the Cold War, the arms accord limited the number of tanks, combat aircraft and attack helicopters, as well as artillery pieces and other heavy weapons, that NATO and Russia could deploy in Western Europe and the western part of Russia.</p></blockquote>
<p> <strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The United States, the European Union and NATO all had urged Russia not to suspend the treaty, which was regarded in Western Europe as a cornerstone agreement for maintaining security on the continent.</p>
<p>&#8220;NATO regrets this decision,&#8221; NATO spokesman James Appathurai said in a statement. &#8220;We hope that the Russian Federation will not take any unilateral actions that undermine the integrity of the treaty. Allies are looking forward to discussing the issue at the upcoming NATO-Russia Council meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Kremlin had previously linked suspension to U.S. plans to deploy a missile defense system in Eastern Europe. The United States says the system is intended as defense against a potential threat from Iran, but Russia fears it will be used to peer into its airspace. Russian officials have not been assuaged by U.S. proposals designed to alleviate those concerns.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>My elderly mother flew to Kansas in November to spend some time with my brother.</p>
<p>She flew back the day after her birthday, so her Ohio driver&#8217;s license was expired by 1 day.</p>
<p>An eagle-eyed employee of TSA spotted her faulty ID, she was pulled out of line and given the &#8220;maybe she is a terrorist treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>My mother does have an extensive criminal record (well, a speeding ticket in 1958 anyway). She looks pretty dangerous, well, only when she has her crochet hooks.</p>
<p>According to the TSA Inspector General, if she been carrying bomb parts they would have probably left her alone.</p>
<p>Do any of you feel safer,  knowing that old ladies are being rousted?</p>

                                <p>Tyler Cowen has an interesting article on the weak dollar in the Times today that is also discussed at economistsview.</p>
<p>Just so everyone would have a good view of imports market share I though I would publish this chart.</p>
<p>Discussion on the dollar often center on the impact of a weak dollar on imports.  But this chart raises the question of how much the currency matters.  Maybe the strength of the domestic economy is much more important then the dollar on this issue.  Just something to think about.</p>

                                <p>When the right turned on The New Republic because Beauchamp was making stuff up, I was at first surprised at the vehemence&#8230;  it seems to me the amount of made-up news is quite plentiful, and as bad Beauchamp&#8217;s BS was, it didn&#8217;t seem all that much worse than a lot of other reporting on both the left and the right.  (I am not a reader of the magazine, nor had I heard of Beauchamp before the scandal broke, so I have nothing invested here.)  I think the problem that the right had with The New Republic was that, well, in any religion, the worst crime is not being an infidel, its apostasy.  And The New Republic was one of the cheerleaders for the War in Iraq.</p>
<p>Which brings up a new &#8220;scandal&#8221; &#8211; this one at the National Review Online &#8211; described here by <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/12/national-revi-1.html">Andrew Sullivan</a>.  As Sullivan notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The alleged factual inaccuracy &#8211; reporting 4,000 Hezbollah gunmen when they didn&#8217;t exist &#8211; dwarfs any alleged incident Beauchamp reported for TNR.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, if the problem with The New Republic is one of factual accuracy, presumably the right will tut-tut the National Review Online as they did The New Republic.  Sure, the NRO has fessed up, but they&#8217;ve also downplayed the issue, whereas I understand that at first, The New Republic stood by its story.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see the right come down on the NRO.  See, here at Angry Bear we&#8217;ve had post after post about the factual inaccuracies and sleights of hand at The NRO.  (Plug in &#8220;national review&#8221; or &#8220;corner&#8221; into the search engine on the upper left side of this page for a sample.)  And its not like we&#8217;re the only ones.  But it doesn&#8217;t matter&#8230; the same factual inaccuracies and sleights of hand continue to appear, and from what I can tell, they don&#8217;t exactly issue corrections either.  I think Matthew Yglesias once noted&#8230; if you can&#8217;t think of what to blog about, check the National Review.</p>

                                <p>A commenter on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/11/ilsms-glossary-relating-to-littoral.html">my recent post on Littoral Combat ships</a> stated this:</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is hard to see why you would object to the interest in these vessels Littoral Combat Ship], unless you are just objecting to our having a powerful/dominant navy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which just puts me on the spot. </p>
<p>I am not sure but the commenter may imply I am less than concerned that the US wins  the next fight. I am very concerned the US wins the next fight. </p>
<p>So concerned am I that I insist that war machine money be wisely spent. </p>
<p>That aside, I missed a few code words!!</p>
<p>Powerful: Used for someone who wants to be libertarian and cause opportunity costs to infringe on the emotional debates of our military spending. Code speak for &#8216;do not ask, we won&#8217;t tell&#8217; if this &#8220;powerful&#8221; Army or Navy or Air Force is worth the taxpayers&#8217; money or if it is more useful to lower infant mortality, care for impoverished elderly or eliminate some poverty. Code for awfully expensive, and implies it to be important. But, without looking at what weak is, powerful is merely stating it is a good profit generator.</p>
<p>Dominant: Powerful on steroids. We always need to fight an asymmetrical war. The US needs to define tactics and equipment for those. New ways of war are progress and profit. Maybe, someone out there will be dumb enough to tilt against the US conveniently in ways we define. Just in case we find a stupid enemy we need all this stuff. Asymmetric warfare is always good unless we lose. It would be better if we had strategies to win than made up ways to fight. It is very desirable to fight cavemen with star wars. Code for awfully expensive and implies we need to go into every possible engagement with utterly asymmetric forces. Let no engagement be too cheap. Dominant means shock and awe. Dominant opens the door for long war, occupation and the slide to fascism.</p>
<p>Both, attempt to put the opponent on the defensive.</p>
<p>I certainly do not want to send our military into a place they won&#8217;t win.</p>
<p>That is why we need to get out of Iraq. Our military is not dominant and is not winning.</p>
<p>Iraq puts the lie to the efficacy of a &#8220;powerful/dominant&#8221;..</p>
<p>What is the sense of tying power and dominance up in a quagmire that is not encouraging to any end game we thought we were fighting for?</p>
<p>What is power and dominance without strategy? What is strategy if they keep changing the goals?</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://sideshow.me.uk/sdec07.htm#12021129">Avedon Carol</a>, this story from the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article2982640.ece">Sunday Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>AMERICA has told Britain that it can “kidnap” British citizens if they are wanted for crimes in the United States.</p>
<p>A senior lawyer for the American government has told the Court of Appeal in London that kidnapping foreign citizens is permissible under American law because the US Supreme Court has sanctioned it.</p>
<p>The admission will alarm the British business community after the case of the so-called NatWest Three, bankers who were extradited to America on fraud charges. More than a dozen other British executives, including senior managers at British Airways and BAE Systems, are under investigation by the US authorities and could face criminal charges in America.</p>
<p>Until now it was commonly assumed that US law permitted kidnapping only in the “extraordinary rendition” of terrorist suspects. </p>
<p>The American government has for the first time made it clear in a British court that the law applies to anyone, British or otherwise, suspected of a crime by Washington.</p></blockquote>
<p>To any law, there is always a special case.  I think most people would regard North Korea&#8217;s occasional kidnapping of Japanese citizens as the act of an uncivilized country, but that most people would applaud Israel&#8217;s capture of Eichmann in Argentina.  But an actual US law that makes it permissible to kidnap anyone suspected of a crime raises seems to me raises an obvious question&#8230; what happens when a foreign country decides they have the right to kidnap American citizens in the US?  And what does this to our moral authority in cases like those of North Korea kidnapping Japanese citizens?  After all, it isn&#8217;t &#8220;illegal&#8221; according to the only law that matters in North Korea.</p>
