<p>After having received e-mails regarding Mark Thoma&#8217;s post on types of unemployment about who was included and excluded from the per centages, I thought a note on the relevance of the employment to population ratio to be worth repeating from comments on that post.</p>
<p>Lifted from comments by run 75441 regarding &#8220;unemployment&#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/new-normal-for-unemployment.html">here</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;[D]id everyone finally awaken to the fact we are experiencing a &#8220;new and lower&#8221; plateau of people in the Civilian Labor Force as a percentage on the Non-Institutional Civilian Population. It is ~1.6% lower than what it was immediately after the 2001 Recession experienced 8 years ago which equates to ~ 4million additional people in the Not In Labor Force.  </p>
<p>Eventually people will re-enter the Labor Force??? For 8 years now much of US Labor has been waiting for the tsunami of job creation that was supposed to come, has not come yet, and I doubt will come soon if . . . if at all. They waited too long to be concerned about unemployed Labor. For almost as many years, states have been engaging in training programs for unemployed workers, and it has not had an impact upon Unemployment or those relegated to the Not In Labor Force because the jobs are not there. Unless there is some serious job creation, outstripping increases in population growth; the plateau of 65.1% is here to stay and will probably drop lower.  </p>
<p>Spencer&#8217;s chart of &#8220;Nonfarm Business Labor Share&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvLucYKJSxI/AAAAAAAAA78/abFmqSf1JLE/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg">here</a>:  puts much into perspective for Labor its share of profits/wages since 1982 as shown here: &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/productivity-growth.html">Productivity Growth</a>.&#8221; That share has been shrinking with the result of fewer people working the same numbers of hours for lower wages as productivity increases. The paradigm of higher productivity creating higher wages or less time worked as Tom Walker suggests, is at least 8 years dead. The increases in productivity is the result of few workers workering and lower hours while wages are dropping or are stagnant. We also have the issue of greater technological advances incorporating more artificial intelligence which will sideline even more labor.  </p>
<p>[Eight] years of [S]tructural Unemployment is not a normal event. There is something radically wrong when Unemployment hovers at higher than normal levels and more people become structurally disenfranchised from the Civilian Labor Force. I might suggest more of the profits is going to Capital rather than Labor and job creation. The infrastructural costs in the US has always been higher than our Asian neighbors and this does include Healthcare Cantab. Hanging overhead is the chance much of the benefits and protective laws making up this infrastural cost may be shuffled into the background for the purpose of creating low wage jobs.  </p>
<p>Thoma&#8217;s article is a nice review of economic history and I hope a basis for some new ideas breaking down the old pardigms of economics. It is not much more than that for now.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the sake of argument, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/feature/2009/11/02/healthcare_employment/index.html">jobs in our future</a> over the next few years or so appear to be in the health care industry and education.  Jobs needing less education than a BA are among the fastest growing. <br />
<blockquote>Where are tomorrow&#8217;s jobs going to come from? The question is more urgent than ever, with official unemployment hovering around 10 percent and with nearly one in five Americans unemployed, if you count part-time workers who want full-time jobs and people so desperate that they have given up looking for work entirely.</p>
<p>Most popular discussion about jobs focuses on the effects of offshoring of manufacturing jobs to China and other countries, many of which, like China, manipulate exchange rates and use subsidies to promote their industries. Combating predatory trade practices and rebalancing global trade by means of higher U.S. exports is important, in the short and medium term. But in the long run technologically driven productivity growth is the most important factor in shaping employment in the U.S. and every country in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Productivity and innovation are the catch words, and examples demonstrate how this has worked in the last century. But if policy makers need to craft a response to mitigate the changes, and re-training happens, what is it going to be?  <br />
<blockquote>The emptying of the cubicles won&#8217;t result in permanent mass unemployment, the present prolonged crisis notwithstanding. As it has always done in the past, labor will shift from more mechanized to less mechanized sectors. But what will those jobs be?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The aging of the boomers accounts for only 10 percent of the growth. The rest comes from increasing demand. That&#8217;s because productivity growth in agriculture, construction and manufacturing has greatly reduced the cost of food, shelter and appliances. In the U.S. and similar nations, the freed-up income tends to be used on quality-of-life goods, of which healthcare is the most important.</p>
<p>&#8230;the economist Robert Fogel, &#8220;Just as electricity and manufacturing were the industries that stimulated the growth of the rest of the economy at the beginning of the 20th century, healthcare is the growth industry of the 21st century. It is a leading sector, which means that expenditures on healthcare will pull forward a wide array of other industries, including manufacturing, education, financial services, communications and construction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Another widespread myth holds that most Americans need to go to college in the future. In reality, most of the fastest-growing jobs, including those in healthcare, do not require a four-year bachelor&#8217;s degree. According to the Council of Economic Advisers: &#8220;The categories with some education required beyond high school are growing faster than those not requiring post-secondary schooling.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>None of this means that we don&#8217;t need world-class scientists and engineers, or that we don&#8217;t need to rebuild our manufacturing export industries, or that we don&#8217;t need to hire people to design and build up-to-date infrastructure and energy systems. High-tech agriculture, manufacturing and infrastructure and related business and professional services will remain essential to economic dynamism. But thanks to ever smarter machines, fewer and fewer people will work in the primary (field), secondary (factory) and tertiary (office) sectors. Most of the job growth will be in the &#8220;quaternary&#8221; sector of healthcare and other qualify-of-life services.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>Larry Summers, who is very very good at provoking debate,  said <br />“It may be desirable to have a given amount of work shared among more people. But that’s not as desirable as expanding the total amount of work.” </p>
<p>Paul Krugman responds <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/opinion/13krugman.html">here</a>  </p>
<p>True. But we are not, in fact, expanding the total amount of work — and Congress doesn’t seem willing to spend enough on stimulus to change that unfortunate fact. So shouldn’t we be considering other measures, if only as a stopgap?”  </p>
<p>Please click the link and read Krugman&#8217;s op-ed if you haven&#8217;t already.  It is excellent but limited to 700 words.  Unlimited reflections on the topic after the jump.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to start with my proposal.  I think that there should be a combination of subsidies for new hires funded by revenues from cap and trade (I&#8217;m a member of the Pigou club) and an increase in the progressivity of the tax system (not just because I always want to increase the progressivity of the tax system).  </p>
<p>Second, Krugman suggests that US unemployment is not just high, but much higher than it need be given the large recession and small stimulus.  Note that the evidence he presents is the change in employment and unemployment in the US and Germany.  One might suspect that this amounts to the US unemployment rate rising to a level similar to the German unemployment rate – that in effect Krugman is proposing that we don&#8217;t accept unemployment that suddenly rises to around 10% in a recession but rather insist on such levels all the time.</p>
<p>One would be wrong (I admit I was such a one, I haven&#8217;t been following German unemployment).  The OECD standardized US unemployment rate <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/12/6/43860143.pdf">surpassed the Euro area unemployment rate in August 2009</a> (warning pdf)  (figures for September are in the mail the August figures were released October 12).  The OECD standardized US unemployment rate 9.7% was significantly higher than the German rate 7.7% in August.  The decline in German GDP was, if anything, slightly larger.  I find this stunning.</p>
<p>So how did they do it and should we do what they did?  </p>
<p>First all Euro area countries have strong restrictions on layoffs.  At least two Italy and Spain have decided not to apply the restrictions to many newly hired workers starting, in the case of Spain, almost 30 years ago.  The Spanish increase in unemployment is even huger than the US increase.</p>
<p>It was already clear in 1980  that employment protection protected employment in recessions.  It is also notable that, before their reforms relaxing restrictions, Italy and Spain managed decades with no employment growth.  I very much like employment protection legislation as it changes the balance of power between workers and employers.   I don&#8217;t like zero employment growth for decades.  In any case, it isn&#8217;t going to happen there (in the USA).  </p>
<p>The effect of employment protection legislation is a confounding factor not relevant to the US policy debate and  a major part of the explanation of the especially bad experiences of the US, Spain and Ireland.  </p>
<p>Second job sharing.  Germans have been doing this for decades.  The idea is that there is a fixed number of hours of work demanded and it is better if everyone works part time than if some are unemployed.  This reasoning is like a red flag to a bull to almost all economists certainly including Larry Summers (and including Paul Krugman in the past).  Krugman considers it a third best approach imposed by political limitations.  I&#8217;d note that the simplest way to do this would be to make the payroll tax progressive so that less has to be paid by firms and workers if there are  more workers each of whom is paid less .  Also a progressive payroll tax implies increased revenues in the future even if marginal rates are a function of real wages (so inflation doesn&#8217;t cause bracket creep). </p>
<p>In one of my favorite papers of all time <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1803472">MacDonald and Solow </a>argue that employment will be increased by a progressive payroll tax for fixed revenues (zero in their model).  They consider a unionized firm (the paper is very old) but evidence on wages suggests that similar things happen without formal unions.  The point is that it doesn&#8217;t really matter why a firm is spending the same money to pay 3 people a lot or 4 people a little.  Whether the 3 are paid a lot because they work longer hours or because they have higher hourly wages, hiring them is still 3 jobs for the price of 4.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see any value added from applying the benefit only in cases in which one can document the splitting of a set of tasks to share jobs.  This would be complicated and I don&#8217;t think there is anything especially desirable about that.</p>
<p>Note a historical example, the Clinton tax increase of 1993.  Not all taxes were increased as the bill also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Taxes were higher on average and much more progressive.  The tax changes were followed  not only by a huge increase in employment but also a downward shift of the Phillips curve.  Theory and evidence correspond in this case.  Also the proposal is wildly popular according to dozens of polls.</p>
<p>OK aside from that Krugman mentions hiring subsidies.  Now most such subsidies would go to employers who would have hired without a subsidy.  One would expect much of that money to go to the workers who would have been hired anyway (how much depends on assumptions about labor markets and/or bargaining).  So ?  It&#8217;s an excuse to pump more money into the economy which would be good policy.  </p>
<p>Also such subsidies have been <a target="_blank" href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119465893/abstract?CRETRY&#038;CRETRY=1&#038;SRETRY=0">shown to affect employment</a>.  In particular a deadline to get the subsidy (only paid if one hires before oh say November 2 2010 just to pick a date) would have a large effect on the speed of the increase in employment.    Following Greg Mankiw, I&#8217;d add it on to cap and trade as part of where the revenues go.    As noted by Mankiw, this is also an excuse to start subsidizing before CO2 permits are actually sold as it takes time to set up a cap and trade system.</p>
<p>So I propose the Greg Mankiw/soak the rich plan to help US employment.</p>

<p>Apropos Angry Bear exploration of &#8220;structural unemployment&#8221;, Mark writes on the topic of unemployment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The types of unemployment</p>
<p>Economists define three types of unemployment: frictional, structural, and cyclical. Frictional unemployment is defined as the unemployment that occurs because of people moving or changing occupations. Demographic change can also play a role in this type of unemployment since young or first-time workers tend to have higher-than-normal turnover rates as they settle into a long-term occupation. An important distinguishing feature of this type of unemployment, unlike the two that follow it, is that it is voluntary on the part of the worker.</p>
<p>Structural unemployment is defined as unemployment arising from technical change such as automation, or from changes in the composition of output due to variations in the types of products people demand. For example, a decline in the demand for typewriters would lead to structurally unemployed workers in the typewriter industry.</p>
<p>Cyclical unemployment is defined as workers losing their jobs due to business cycle fluctuations in output, i.e. the normal up and down movements in the economy as it cycles through booms and recessions over time.</p>
<p>What is normal unemployment?</p>
<p>Cyclical unemployment is the main worry of policymakers such as the Fed, and they attempt to minimize this type of unemployment through policy changes such as lowering interest rates in recessions. We are currently seeing this in action. Frictional and structural unemployment are considered normal and necessary. When these are the only two types of unemployment that exist, i.e. when cyclical unemployment has been eliminated, the economy is considered to be at full employment.</p>
<p>Why are frictional and structural unemployment considered normal and necessary? Frictional unemployment promotes efficient matching of workers and jobs. It allows workers to leave jobs they don’t like or aren’t good at and then find new jobs to which they are better suited. If there were never any vacancies, finding a better matching job would be much more difficult if not impossible. It would require trading jobs with someone who has the job you want and wants the job you have (and both employers would have to agree to make the hires). This means that some degree of frictional unemployment is desirable.</p>
<p>Structural unemployment allows the economy to implement new technology such as robots on assembly lines, and to respond to changes in demand for various products. If we didn’t allow this type of technological change, we’d be using outdated production methods and always be consuming exactly the same mix of goods at every point in time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once defined, and probably needing several posts as AB is finding, is the call for retraining, workers moving to where the jobs are, and incentives for US firms to locate in areas of the US needing development.</p>
<blockquote><p>The change in the structural component could, however, be significant. I expect structural unemployment to be higher than it was, particularly in the next few years. We had too many resources in housing, finance, and automobile production, and it will take time for the economy to make the necessary structural adjustments. When this is combined with continuing globalization, as well as the higher savings rate and correspondingly lower consumption expected from households in the future, both of which cause structural change within the economy, the expectation is that the new target rate of unemployment will rise above the 4 percent level it was at before the recession.</p>
<p>Exactly how much it will rise and for how long is hard to say. A 5 or 6 percent rate, or even somewhat higher is certainly imaginable, but getting it right is important. If policymakers target an unemployment rate that is too low, they risk causing inflation (one reason for the high rate of inflation in the 1970s is that the Fed targeted a 4 percent unemployment rate when the actual rate of normal unemployment was much higher due to structural and demographic change). If they target a rate that is too high, then they risk having people be unnecessarily unemployed in the economy.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean we are completely powerless. There are ways to help with structural unemployment, though the tools for doing so aren’t as powerful as we’d like. In essence, structural unemployment arises from a mismatch between the supply of jobs in various industries and geographical locations, and the workers available to meet those needs. Thus, job training that promotes a better match of worker skills with available jobs, programs that help workers move to places where jobs exist, and programs to induce firms to locate where there is an oversupply of workers, e.g. Detroit, can mitigate some of the impact. Extended unemployment compensation can also cushion the blow for workers during the adjustment period. But the history of these programs indicates that we shouldn’t expect miracles for workers, and some degree of higher unemployment will need to be tolerated while the economy undergoes the necessary structural adjustments.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>As I am arguing <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703574604574501632123501814.html">on the same side as Henry Kaufman</a>, and against the <a target="_blank" href="http://moneywatch.bnet.com/economic-news/blog/maximum-utility/the-importance-of-fed-independence/151/">kind-hearted Mark Thoma</a>, does the phrase &#8220;left-of-center&#8221; at the top of this blog have as much Memory Meaning as the Suzanne Vega song from <em><a target="_blank" href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0091790/">Pretty in Pink</a></em>?</p>
<p>Kaufman:<br />
<blockquote>During the Greenspan years (1987-2006), the Fed clearly failed to recognize the significance of the many structural changes in the financial markets—such as the rapid growth of securitization and derivatives—on economic and financial behavior and thus for its monetary policy. The Fed also failed to foresee how the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had separated commercial from investment banking since 1933, would sharply accelerate financial concentration through mergers and acquisitions and thus contribute to the &#8220;too-big-to-fail&#8221; phenomenon.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thoma:<br />
<blockquote>The hope is that an independent Fed can overcome the temptation to use monetary policy to influence elections, and also overcome the temptation to monetize the debt, and that it will do what’s best for the economy in the long-run rather than adopting the policy that maximizes the chances of politicians being reelected.</p></blockquote>
<p>On of those people lives in reality.  The other, apparently, is a good econometrician.

<p>Back in July I singled out what I thought was the single most important provision of the House Tri-Committee Bill in a post called <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/07/hr3200-sec-116-golden-bullet-or-smoking.html">Sec 116: Golden Bullet or Smoking Gun</a>. Yesterday I followed up with a new post here called <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/still-most-important-sentence-in-house.html">STILL the Most Important Sentence in the House HR Bill</a> which cited the ALMOST identical language between Sec 116 of the Tri-Committee Bill and Sec 102 of the bill as brought to the floor and posted similar material in diaries at dKos, MyDD, and Open Left. Only to find out from  commenter Gerald Weinand, who actually read the bill with close attention to detail, that there were significant changes in wording that drastically changed the impact of this language by shifting it forward in time and then sunsetting it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what to make of this change, but it is the subject of a LONG piece at the BruceWeb <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/11/read-bill-part-3-and-possible-reading.html">Read the Bill Part 3; and a possible reading error</a>. In any event going forward I think it is vital that everyone be reading off the same page. The above link to the bill as passed may not be stable, if not you can search it pretty easily from the Thomas.gov site or use the pdf version published by the GPO:  http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&#038;docid=f:h3962eh.txt.pdf<br />(Update: MG supplies a better Thomas link: http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.03962 Thanx)</p>
<p>My personal belief and a hope is that a mistake has been made and that this provision was not meant to sunset when the Exchange starts operation, and that a fix will be made, it would be a true shame if the best regulatory control of insurance company profits just ended up on the cutting floor, either deliberately or by accident.</p>
