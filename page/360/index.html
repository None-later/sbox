<p>Employers Jailed for ‘Unconscionable&#8217; Failure<br />to Pay Court-Ordered Back Wages</p>
<p>The owners of a residential cleaning service were taken into custody and later released after failing to comply with a court order directing payment of $3.5 million in back wages, plus interest, fines, and liquidated damages, to at least 385 workers.</p>
<p>“It is unconscionable that an employer would continue to disregard the obligation to pay vulnerable workers, even after being ordered to do so by a federal judge,” said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis.</p>
<p>The owners of Southern California Maid Service and Carpet Cleaning Inc. were taken into custody Friday, October 30, and released Tuesday evening, November 3, after appearing before the judge and agreeing to start making payments.</p>
<p>The court sided with the U.S. Department of Labor in finding that the company had wrongly classified its home and carpet cleaners as independent contractors and failed to pay them the federally required minimum wage or overtime for hours worked over 40 per week.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The court awarded back wages to the workers on August 21, 2007, following an investigation by the Labor Department&#8217;s Wage and Hour Division. Judge The court also ordered payment of more than $1 million in liquidated damages for violations of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).</p>
<p>The Labor Department filed civil contempt charges for continued failure to comply with the order. In April 2009, the court ordered daily fines against the company of $2,000, plus an additional $200 per day each from the company owners.</p>
<p>The district office of DOL&#8217;s Wage and Hour Division learned of the employer&#8217;s practices through its participation in the Employment Education and Outreach (EMPLEO) partnership. EMPLEO is an alliance of organizations and government agencies that assist Spanish-speaking workers and employers with work-related concerns. Callers to a toll-free helpline, 877-55-AYUDA (552-9832), are referred to EMPLEO partner organizations for assistance.</p>
<p>The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage and receive overtime at one and one-half times their regular rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employers must also maintain accurate time and payroll records. Solis v. Southern California Maid Service and Carpet Cleaning Inc., Case Number: CV 06-3903 AG (MANx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.<br /><!-- more --></p>

                                <p>Via (what else?) <a href="http://www.aleablog.com/">Alea&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/alea_">Twitter feed</a>, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-05/taylor-disputes-bernanke-on-bubble-says-low-rates-played-role.html">John Taylor defends himself against Ben Bernanke</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The evidence is overwhelming that those low interest rates were not only unusually low but they logically were a factor in the housing boom and therefore ultimately the bust,&#8221; Taylor, a Stanford University economist, said in an interview today in Atlanta.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not actually that they&#8217;re not saying the same thing.  Bernanke argued (and I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/01/bernanke-we-didnt-do-good-job.html">agreed</a>) that low rates did not <em>cause</em> the housing bubble.  We have had low rates without producing housing bubbles before. (Other asset bubbles are another question.)  Indeed, the last lasting housing bubble peaked just as the Federal Funds rate did:
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S0Tmmx0VI-I/AAAAAAAAAXM/aAEuvpvGnOw/s1600-h/FedFunds8791.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S0Tmmx0VI-I/AAAAAAAAAXM/aAEuvpvGnOw/s400/FedFunds8791.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>More accurately (and also via ATF), Caroline Baum <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&#038;sid=aEOlHv_s1HWw">takes Bernanke to task for sleight-of-hand</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, Bernanke takes great pains to rebut criticism that the funds rate was well below where the Taylor Rule&#8230;suggested it should be following the 2001 recession. The Taylor Rule uses actual inflation versus target inflation and actual gross domestic product versus potential GDP to determine the appropriate level of the funds rate.</p>
<p>Substitute forecast inflation for actual inflation, and the personal consumption expenditures price index for the consumer price index, and &#8212; voila! &#8212; monetary policy looks far less accommodating, Bernanke said.</p>
<p>It’s always easier to start with a desired conclusion and retrofit a model or equation to prove it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch.  Is it a great day when the journalist is making more sense about the economist&#8217;s work than another economist is?</p>
<p>But more to the point, the argument that rates were kept unnaturally low from ca. 2002 through ca. 2005 depends very much on the idea that the Fed does not have two jobs. (Once again, h/t to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=12&#038;year=2009&#038;base_name=if_bernanke_did_not_know_the_f">Dean Baker</a>.)</p>
<p>The other half below the break<br /><a name="more"></a><br />As Baker notes at the link above, &#8220;the dual mandate [of the Fed] is full employment (defined as 4.0 percent unemployment) and price stability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be generous.  I&#8217;ve plotted the Civilian Employment/Population Ratio and the Official Unemployment Rate below.  The blue line at 4.5 applies only to the Unemployment Rate (red line). (I didn&#8217;t plot it at 4.0 because that would be cruel.)
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S0UBFDp8PEI/AAAAAAAAAXc/MJ8r-Y7T1cg/s1600-h/Employ.GIF"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S0UBFDp8PEI/AAAAAAAAAXc/MJ8r-Y7T1cg/s400/Employ.GIF" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So what we have is a situation where (1) the Employment/Population Ratio by the end of 2006 is barely back near the level it was at the <em>end</em> of the recession of 2001 and (2) it is only near the end of 2006 that the Official Unemployment Rates <em>approaches</em> the official target rate (which it hadn&#8217;t seen since before the 2001 recession).</p>
<p>It seems apparent that Taylor&#8217;s &#8220;Rule&#8221; (which considers inflation and GDP, but not employment <em>per se</em>) is not compatible with official Fed mandates.  In such a context, Caroline Baum&#8217;s &#8220;gotcha&#8221; is more a case of her using inappropriate variables—and Bernanke substituting a more appropriate model, given the Fed&#8217;s mandates—than it is a case of Bernanke &#8220;retrofitting.&#8221;</p>
<p>No wonder John Taylor says we should worry about inflation; in his world, we never have to worry about unemployment, so long as there are enough bubbles to inflate GDP.</p>

<p>Yves Smith (<a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/" target="_blank">Naked Capitalism</a>) links to an interesting post on &#8220;Economists for Firing Larry Summers&#8221; (I&#8217;ll call this EFLS). The author of the blog is a PhD student in economics, in a &#8220;top 30&#8221; department who is obviously fed up with much of current economic thought. He writes on <a href="http://firelarrysummersnow.blogspot.com/2009/12/case-for-millionaires-surtax.html" target="_blank">&#8220;The Case for the Millionaires Surtax&#8221;</a> (Dec. 26, 2009). </p>
<p>The right is up in arms about the possibility of slightly higher taxes on wealthy people. I&#8217;ve received emails because of my blog postings favoring higher taxes, and also comments directly on the blog, to the effect that higher taxes will just drive people out of those jobs. They will quit rather than pay high taxes, or go take jobs abroad instead of paying higher taxes here, and then, the questioners ask, where will the good ole US of A be&#8211;no wealthy people working and no tax money collected, they say. I respond that they are missing a few essential steps in the arguments. Sure, some will be wealthy enough to drop it all and leave, but most won&#8217;t do so . They simply don&#8217;t wanna stop working at what they work at. </p>
<p>EFLS uses the case of super-athlete Peyton Manning. If you tax him 10% more, will he just arrnge to be paid only through the regular season, letting another substitute in championship competitions so he can pay less tax? No way. If he decides to retire, then another super-athlete will take his place, and the US can tax that person. If he decides to stay (most likely) then the US can tax him. Same for CFOs and CEOs and movie stars and all those other high-paid celebrities. If they step aside, someone else just steps into the gap. It really is quite likely that raising the rates can achieve the result of higher taxes paid.</p>
<p>Now, if they take evasive steps, that&#8217;s another problem. As EFLS says, that doesn&#8217;t mean don&#8217;t raise rates. It means fund the IRS so tax cheats can&#8217;t get away with it. The net result of lowering tax rates is that the wealthy will still do the same stuff, pay less taxes, and there will be even more inequality in the economy than before&#8211;which is itself a problem.</p>
<p>And then EFLS makes the argument from the perspective of democratic egalitarianism. </p>
<blockquote><p>[S]uppose the CEO of Anthem made $4 million rather than $40 million due to high tax rates on multi-million dollar incomes (which we do not currently have). While in the micro context, this would greatly reduce the government&#8217;s revenue, in this case, Anthem would have higher profits, or could afford to pay it&#8217;s other workers more, could cut prices to gain more market share, or might even be able to deny fewer claims. In other words, it wouldn&#8217;t make the whole pie smaller, it would just make it more equally distributed. And, to the extent that the Anthem CEO no longer flies around in a private Jet, owns 6 houses, and drinks $1000 bottles of wine, redistributive taxes would quite likely make the pie bigger&#8230;</p></blockquote>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Note: I planned to finish this here, but the post became far too long, and splits quite well.  What follows is applications of economic theory and background material on financial decisions.</p>
<p>To be clear, I hate the phrase “casino capitalism.” It’s rather unfair to casinos, which know how to do risk management: make an offer that is close to fair, enough to cover your expenses, and offer non-monetary benefits (inexpensive food, table-service drinks, floor shows, etc.) so that even the losers enjoy the experience. Unless you forget that <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/28/chapter-33-for-trump-casinos/" target="_blank">Atlantic City is a dreary place in the Winter</a>, it’s a license to print money.  Capitalism, on the other hand, thrives because people have a dollar, a dream, and the inability to calculate odds correctly. (This is a good thing—at its worst, it leads to more frictional unemployment as those dreams fade or are restructured.)</p>
<p>But “casino capitalism” is good for presenting an example. Consider the following scenario: you and I go to Atlantic City, each with $190.  We also have a Mysterious Benefactor, who offers us the following: “You must each make 19 bets of $10. If you will play only Red or Black, I will make you whole for the $10 for any time the wheel produces 0 or 00.  If you make any other bet (a specific number, for instance), you win or lose your bet as the wheel results.  I do not care if you both bet the same color, or only one of you bets in a round. My offer covers your first 38 bets.”</p>
<p><em>Ex ante</em>, the expectation should be that each of us will go home with $190, while our Mysterious Benefactor will be $20 poorer.  This is because</p>
<ol>
<li>It would be irrational to play anything other than Red or Black </li>
<li>For each spin, there are 18 chances of Red, 18 chances of Black, and 2 chances of green (0 and 00).  So if I play Red every time and you play Black every time, one of us should win 36 of 38—or 18 out of 19—times, with the other(s) covered in full by our Mysterious Benefactor. </li>
<li>In any other scenario, the odds favor the house. (Any individual number pays 36:1, but there is only a 1 in 38 chance of being correct.)  Therefore, our Expected performance would be to lose money. (Or, slightly more accurately, to trade some money for the pleasure [“utility”] we receive from “gambling.”) </li>
</ol>
<p>All of the above, of course, assumes we have agreed to pool our winnings, and that we hold to the agreement.  (If you want to simplify the exercise, assume that only one person has $380 and a Mysterious Benefactor offering the same terms.  For the following, I’ll use the simplified example and “you.”)</p>
<p>But <em>ex ante</em> is not <em>ex poste, </em>and reasonable plans at the beginning may be altered as time goes by and “randomness” affects the model.</p>
<p>For instance, assume you have made 37 of the 38 bets and your current result is that you are up $50.  Do you follow the pattern, or do you perhaps make a larger wager—say $40, knowing that your worst result now is better than your Expected result at the beginning?</p>
<p>Consider the same scenario, but that you are <em>down</em> $50.  Your best case following the pattern is to win and be down $40; your worst would be to lose and be down $60.  Do you continue to follow the “rational” path, or take a chance on the last roll, knowing that any other action destines you to a lower-than-Expected result?</p>
<p>As The Boss once sang, “Down here it’s just winners and losers/And don’t get caught on the wrong side of that line.” In a situation where there has been a long winning streak—or a long losing streak—the actions may blur enough that you cannot tell the difference between the two.</p>
<p>For years, Fannie, Freddie, and the FHA stayed out of the exotic mortgages market.  Their payoff was that their risk was manageable, but their market share declined.  As a government-owned entity, FHA’s abstinence was both prudent and within its mandate.  As Government-<em>Sponsored</em> but <strong>Private</strong> Entities, Fannie and Freddie had an obligation to their shareholders that was antithetical to their original purpose. Under Daniel “Son of Roger, Acts like Harry” Mudd, Fannie expanded their actions into exotic mortgages, stoking a fire that might well have dimmed, if not gone out, for another 18 to 24 months.</p>
<p>The infection had moved from the skin into the system. There is good reason that the opening chapter of John Quiggin’s forthcoming book discusses the religion of privatization.</p>
<p>Led by cheerleaders such as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/12/grass-is-green-sky-is-blue-wsj-lies-to.html" target="_blank">David Malpass</a>, the houses-are-a-liquid-asset crowd came to dominant the discourse, even as and—thanks to Mudd and his FHLMC peer—well after Dean Baker sold his condo.</p>
<p>Who were the winners?  The people who had always acted as if they were casinos: the investment banks that gathered, packaged and securitized loans, taking their cut off the top and moving on to the next set. The servicers, who used the same type of business model—take a quarter (25 bp) or less off the top, and pass the rest through. The Investment Banks that played in the market, but were not dependent upon it, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and, to a lesser extent, Merrill Lynch. And the speculators who had flipped houses throughout the upturn (though some of them didn’t stop soon enough, or bet too much on that last roll).</p>
<p>The losers were the people left holding the securities when the music stopped.  Your pension fund, for instance. Or originators such as IndyMac or WaMu, whose business model ceased to work. And the investment banks with high fixed costs in mortgage-related areas, the two most prominent of which happened to be Lehmann Brothers and Bear Stearns.</p>
<p>By all reports, the securitization bubble burst at Hallowe’en of 2006.  I’m told the desert states—CA, AZ, NV—went to the well then and discovered that it was dry.  That’s not the whole story, of course; someone cut off the flow, for reasons related or other. (The most reliable story I’ve heard is that Commercial and Investment Banks cut off credit lines to suppliers who were, in turn, sending them the product they securitized and sold.  Which only brings the question back another step: why did they choose then to do it?)</p>
<p>This left deals in the pipeline, most especially at the firms that focused on the mortgage market. (At Bear, the flow did not die until January of 2007. By that time, the firm had acquired a couple of the originators, integrating the model.)</p>
<p>The effect was similar to the roulette example above.  While people such as <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/fed-wont-ride-to-rescue-of-upset-markets-poole-2007731135200" target="_blank">then Fed Governor William Poole</a> were denying that the Greenspan Put would be used, the abiding belief in it served the role of the Mysterious Benefactor.</p>
<p>Firms that had “losing streaks” went quietly away, like hedge funds in the night. Firms that won tended to “let it ride,” increasing their investments in the area both in anticipation of future profits and as a way to keep their producers happy by making their job easier. (The MBS slice-and-dice system that Tom Marano had wanted five years before, and been promised by at least three different Line Managers, went live in December of 2006. Marano—who is no slouch and knows the mortgage market inside and out—<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/trickle-down-in-action.html" target="_blank">failed up</a>, and is now <a href="http://media.gmacfs.com/index.php?s=20&#038;item=83" target="_blank">CEO of GMAC’s mortgage operations and their “chief capital markets executive</a>.” GMAC, as <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2007/03/buy-gm-cars-mortgage-market-needs-to-be.html" target="_blank">I noted at Tom’s Place nearly three years ago</a>, is a mortgage originator disguised as a car financing company. He’s both the right person for the job, and a sign that the job itself is likely impossible.)</p>
<p>They bet Black every time, and were right until they were wrong and it came up Very Red.</p>
<p>The cost is slowly becoming apparent, as even the denier-economists (including Hans-Werner Sinn, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Casino-Capitalism-Financial-Crisis-About/dp/0199588279/ref=sr_1_47?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1262727513&#038;sr=1-47" target="_blank">Casino Capitalism</a>) are slowly realizing that the problem was never subprime (not large enough to damage the whole market, though certainly a contributor) but asset inflation in an unregulated environment combined with easy money and the associated low interest rates that made the true cost of a mortgage progressively less transparent.</p>
<p>The proof of that is, to some extent, in the timing.  Look back at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/01/bernanke-we-didnt-do-good-job.html" target="_blank">Ben Bernanke’s speech</a>, and see the points at which the Federal Reserve finally starts addressing the issues: they talk in 2005—Alan Greenspan’s last year—begin hearings under Bernanke in 2006, and only take action in 2007.  As capital requirements actually moved into place and some losses from the private paper issued four and five years earlier that began resetting—combining the full force of negative amortization with higher interest rates and stagnant-to-negative wages—the barn door was closed, with the cost of those horses that had escaped still not fully realized.</p>
<p>As I noted in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/01/today-in-economists-are-not-totally_03.html" target="_blank">Part 3</a> of this ramble, Economists like equilibrium.  It’s when the bettors start amassing a “run of luck” that incentives get out of place.</p>
<p>The thing about equilibrium is that you don’t necessarily return to it just by declaring that a new set of bets can be placed.  Sometimes, the house hasn’t been paid for all the bad bets.  And until it has been, pretending a return to equilibrium doesn’t make it so.</p>

<p>Poverty and the Real Median Income</p>
<p>I want to take a break from my usual taxes and economic growth beat, and I figured why not look at poverty and income. Normally I&#8217;d pull the data from the Census site, but for some reason it was down when I went looking (that&#8217;s right, folks, around here we get our data is fresh from the tree) so I settled for the offerings from the Statistical Abstract of the United States. (Yes, I know, it is compiled by the Census, but for some reason that site was up.) All that means is that I don&#8217;t have the latest year of data, so y&#8217;all have my apologies now.</p>
<p>The following graph shows <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2010/tables/10s0695.xls">the percentage of people below 125% of the poverty line</a> on the left y-axis and the <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2010/tables/10s0685.xls">real median income in 2007</a> for males and for females on the right y-axis. </p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/S0H5-9wcbyI/AAAAAAAAAr8/Nq2A0l1-J-o/s1600-h/poverty1.bmp" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" ps="true" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/S0H5-9wcbyI/AAAAAAAAAr8/Nq2A0l1-J-o/s320/poverty1.bmp"></a></div>
<p>The correlation between female real median income and the percentage of people living in poverty (OK, 125% of poverty) is about -64%, but the correlation between the male real median income and the percentage of people living (grumble) within 125% of poverty is about -92%. Given that the real female median income is about $21K a year, one figures a substantial number of women are making so little that there isn&#8217;t much that is going to boost them into the ranks of the well-to-do despite what the folks at Cato or Heritage peddle. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>So let&#8217;s drop the female median income, and focus in on male real median income and poverty. They seem to be inversely, as the graph below shows:</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/S0H6RgWMfqI/AAAAAAAAAsE/JMyvB9WJ28M/s1600-h/poverty2.bmp" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" ps="true" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/S0H6RgWMfqI/AAAAAAAAAsE/JMyvB9WJ28M/s320/poverty2.bmp"></a></div>
<p>I took the liberty of color coding a few periods. There are three periods where income grew and poverty fell:</p>
<p>1. very rapid improvement through 1973<br />2. so-so improvement from 1982 to 1989<br />3. pretty good growth from 1993 to 2000</p>
<p>The data doesn&#8217;t stretch back far enough to say precisely when the first period began, but it seems to be running out of gas after the political transition in 1969, and completely dies with the disastrous year of 1973. The third period definitely seems to begin and end with Clinton. In both instances, there was a strong commitment to doing something about poverty (from JFK, LBJ, and Clinton). </p>
<p>So what&#8217;s up with the second period? 82 is when Volker finally killed inflation, and good things started (finally) to happen in the economy again. But 1989 or thereabouts did not mark the end of Reaganomics (Bush Sr. tried to continue it) or the Volker administration. So what changed? Is it possible the real median income and poverty reduction benefits observed from 82 to 87 just kind of along for the ride that resulted from the death of inflation, and that by itself could only produce so much benefit? Or did Bush Sr. really change something major around 1989? cdThoughts?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Next week &#8211; more on taxes and economic growth, guaranteed to be contentious!!!</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>Yesterday, run75441 sent an e-mail to the Bears touching off a bit of a discussion on the perennial question of what constitutes the &#8220;middle class&#8221; or a &#8220;middle-class income.&#8221;  Run&#8217;s touchstone was the AMT, which has been turned by bad legislation (not indexing the zero bracket; interactions with the Bush-era changes to the ordinary income tax) and 40 years of inflation into something that &#8220;requires&#8221; — in the sense of avoiding the actual or perceived political catastrophe of raising taxes on a (fairly) large number of (mostly) upper-middle income taxpayers with high propensities to vote — annual patches to keep it mainly an upper-upper-middle-income tax.  While there are horror stories about middle-income taxpayers with unusual circumstances being hit with AMT (e.g.  due to exceptional numbers of exemptions for dependents), the patches mainly serve to keep AMT off the backs of low-six-figure earners who, despite being relatively well-to-do, nevertheless don&#8217;t have sufficient income to be in line for tax increases under Obamanomics.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve viewed the $200K or $250K-ish threshold for who&#8217;s rich enough to be subject to so much as the statutory income-tax rates of the 1990s as a mutant offspring of behavioral economics and tax politics.  It&#8217;s a figure that happens to be enough money that people who will never make $100K (but <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2009/04/11/estate-tax-exemption-debate/">don&#8217;t know it</a>) won&#8217;t worry that raised upper-income taxes will affect themselves, or something like that.  Based on criteria such as ability to pay without major hardship, I&#8217;m with <a href="http://www.felixsalmon.com/003888.html">Felix Salmon</a> that the boundary of the &#8220;rich&#8221; is being set too high.</p>
<p>That said, there is an interesting qualitative change in the structure of income that starts to happen around this cutoff for the &#8220;rich&#8221; which actually suggests that taxpayers above that threshold are rich in most important ways.  The most recent (2007) <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/indtaxstats/article/0,,id=98123,00.html">tax stats</a> from the IRS now reflect the peak of the late bubble and show that the $100K-$200K AGI bucket is the last one that more-or-less resembles middle-income categories in their dependence on labor as the all-but exclusive source of income.  (Think of pensions and proceeds of retirement accounts as representing deferred wages or salaries.)

<p>Starting with the $200-500K category, the share of earnings from labor begins a marked decline.  By the time you hit mid-six figures, average earnings from income, dividends, and capital gains become high enough to provide middle-class or better incomes without (necessarily) working.  Tax returns in the upper-six-figure bucket, on average, show more income from other sources collectively than from salaries, and at the top of the income scale even interest and dividend income exceeds wages and salaries. (**)  I suggest that if you can provide yourself with a better-than-average living without working, a very rare luxury indeed, you are in fact rich.</p>
<p>(Revised and slightly expanded.)</p>
<p>(*) That some of the shares sum to more than 100 percent is not an error.  Some sources of income, notably nontaxable Social Security benefits, are not part of AGI.  If average incomes by bracket are not plotted on a log scale, that line looks like everyone except the super-rich makes nothing.</p>
<p>(**) Moreover, high-earners are negligibly dependent on Social Security and pensions for retirement income, in case anyone wonders about the origins of the long-running war on social insurance.</p>

<blockquote>Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson initially sold Congress in the fall of 2008 on emergency intervention to purchase “toxic assets,” but quickly reversed course in favor of direct capital injections. Those <em>favored</em> financial institutions revived more quickly than most thought possible and most of those injections have already been paid back. <em>However, most of the toxic assets remain on bank balance sheets, impeding new lending. </em>[emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>At the end of the last post, I was ready to discuss “deadweight loss.” But a brief detour seems in order.</p>
<p>We used to talk a lot at this blog about DSGE models. Economists talk a lot about Equilibrium, even if they don’t fully understand it. At its core, saying “equilibrium” is saying “this is the best of all possible worlds.”  You can’t improve on equilibrium unless you choose a non-Pareto-optimal solution (i.e., a solution in which at least one person is affected negatively).</p>
<p>Equilibrium doesn’t mean you have achieved ideal social welfare. (Anyone who has looked at Game Theory for more than a minute can tell you that.)  But it does mean that things are “hitting on all cylinders.”  Or, more accurately, if the economy is <strong>not</strong> at equilibrium, the odds are better that people making choices will make mistakes.</p>
<p>Which is why I pointed to <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2010/01/1983-ponzi-game-prediction.html" target="_blank">Brenda Rosser</a> and especially this<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The way out of this thing is a shift in the way we treat the LDC debt,&#8221; Coldwell argued. &#8220;The banks would have to take a big hit on their balance sheets, but then it&#8217;s over. If you give them a definitive hit, then they could say it&#8217;s behind us. If you get down to a crisis stage, the banks would accept that. They would have no choice.” &#8212; William Greider. &#8216;The Secrets of the Temple &#8211; How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country&#8217; Touchstone 1989. Page 549</p></blockquote>
<p>If the banks take that hit, we’re back at equilibrium.  If they don’t, they continue to make suboptimal choices.  Which brings us back to the graphic.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Sz_3sgW14fI/AAAAAAAAAW8/dqY9ItVe21k/s1600-h/NonPerfLoansQtrly.JPG"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Sz_3sgW14fI/AAAAAAAAAW8/dqY9ItVe21k/s400/NonPerfLoansQtrly.JPG"></a></p>
<p>There were several good suggestions for refinement in the comments, none of which can I do at the moment, since I’m working solely from FRED data. (General response: those acquisitions, especially WaMu, were made on terms that were agreeable to all acquiring parties. Which doesn’t mean those acquisitions may not be affecting the flow, but it’s likely more a question of acceleration than velocity, especially given the relative sizes of the institutions.)</p>
<p>But the FRED data is damning enough.  The risk management procedures at larger institutions were significantly worse than they were at smaller ones.  And the bigger they are, the worse they are becoming:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S0H8o5ZOg_I/AAAAAAAAAXE/Y14aM6VSJWg/s1600-h/NPLLargeBanks.JPG"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S0H8o5ZOg_I/AAAAAAAAAXE/Y14aM6VSJWg/s400/NPLLargeBanks.JPG"></a></p>
<p>With several waves of doubt still to come, we are (choose one) (a) far from equilibrium or (b) still making suboptimal choices.</p>
<p>So let’s do a finger exercise.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Mortgages Outstanding approx. $11 trillion (Q4 2008)</p>
<p>Amount at risk (SWAG)25%</p>
<p>Expected Losses $2.75T</p>
<p>Fed Holdings (<a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2009/12/term_deposit_fa.html" target="_blank">TARP, TALF, CPLF, etc.</a>) approx. $2.2 T</p>
<p>Remaining Balance Sheet Exposuren approx. $550B</p>
<p>25% at risk seems about right.  Slightly over 10% of that $11T was Home Equity Loans, and the outstanding household debt at that time was <a href="http://mwhodges.home.att.net/nat-debt/debt-nat-a.htm#household" target="_blank">about 123% of national income</a> while <a href="http://mwhodges.home.att.net/family_a.htm#home_equity" target="_blank">equity was around 40%</a>.</p>
<p>But note that this assumes that all of the special facilities remain in place. For instance, per Hamilton’s graphic, the Fed now owns about $1T worth of MBSes. CR notes that this program “<a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/01/pimcos-mcculley-three-major-issues-for.html" target="_blank">is scheduled to be complete by the end of Q1</a>.”</p>
<p>Of course, there are some cures that would be worse than the disease.  Via alea’s Twitter feed, I see that either the headline writer or the speaker <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0320287220100103" target="_blank">made a slip yesterday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;There ought to be government-backed ABS,&#8221; said Fed economist Wayne Passmore in a presentation to the American Economic Association.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that the quote is not (just) MBS but <strong>A</strong>BS—<em>asset</em>-backed securities, including credit-card receivables, car loans, basically any form of consumer (or other) debt that can be securitized.  The result of this would be that your tax dollars would pay a bank for your default on a credit card that charged you 30% interest, despite the risk-free rate being something near 0%—and almost always in the 5-8% range.</p>
<p>The reason we like equilibrium is that people who make mistakes do so because they are “being irrational.” When we’re not at equilibrium, we realize that they make irrational decisions all the time.  In what I hope will be the last of this series, we’ll look at irrational and rational decisions—and why irrationality may be the best survival strategy.</p>

                                <p>So far the topical open threads have gathered great material. As Bruce mentioned and hoped, the partisan nature that accompanied certain posts was muted when readers could offer a  look at topics such as trade and entitlements without the intervening point of view of a particular post.</p>
<p>Angry Bear will always offer attitude and links, but I for one found the format informative and I think will continue the conversation.</p>
<p>To avoid any confusion I will label &#8216;open threads&#8217; as such for any subject, and use the term &#8216;topical threads&#8217; by providing a subject title as in the last two.  We don&#8217;t have the option of offering forums except through google groups, but this move to informed conversation appeals to me and suffices for now.  </p>
<p>Unless of course someone offers an alternative&#8230;</p>
