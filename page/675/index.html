                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Today, we hear that the government may well have to nationalize the mortgages as well as formally nationalize Fannie and Freddie. So says <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/250488">Nouriel Roubini</a> and <a href="http://www.zimbio.com/pilot?SP=1&#038;ZURL=%2FCongressman%2BBarney%2BFrank%2Frolls%2F5%3FSort%3Drank&#038;URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.house.gov%2Ffrank%2F">Barney Franks</a>.</p>
<p>While their recommendations may differ in details, both see the government as the savior of last resort.</p>
<p>If they are correct in their assessment of the gravity of the problem, i.e., that the so-called &#8220;shadow system of banking&#8221; is about to implode, resulting in the worst crisis since the Great Depression, then we may well need to rethink our &#8220;laissez-faire&#8221; system of capitalism.  Certainly our financial system needs more oversight.</p>
<p>Health care is in deep trouble. Municipal bonds are failing at auction. Higher education is becoming less and less affordable. The mega-rich get richer; the rest of us, struggle. The list goes on and on.  Privatization sans regulations seem to be a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>I was struck with one comment on the Roubini post:</p>
<blockquote><p>When will you guys learn that the regulatory welfare state is designed to save capitalism from its own excesses, not destroy it?<br />[Peter Principle] </p></blockquote>
<p>Such an apt nickname for such a provocative comment. Has U.S. capitalism finally reached its level of true incompetence?</p>
<p>While many on this blog will shudder at such a conclusion and such a solution, events may so unfold that what we have been taught to believe as unthinkable may well be the only answer.<br />

                                <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7289194.stm">The BBC</a> had a note about food prices rising.</p>
<blockquote><p>And given that global wheat prices are so high, it is tempting for farmers to borrow more in their hope that their gamble pays off with a bumper harvest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really is back to the bank manager,&#8221; says George, explaining how that conversation will now go: &#8220;&#8216;OK, this is THE crop. Everyone is talking it up. Let&#8217;s have a go at it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s borrowed money that&#8217;s doing it. And if it doesn&#8217;t come off and there are too many more [poor years], then you have to sell the farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>But who is going to buy the farms?</p>
<p>&#8220;There are already two or three farms in the district which are up for sale and should have been sold. But people just don&#8217;t have the money to buy them,&#8221; explains George.</p>
<p>With global wheat prices at record highs, one bumper crop would alleviate much of the financial burden and help many local farmers pay off their debts.</p>
<p>But their hopes have been dashed before.</p>
<p>Last year saw one of the best starts to a growing season for years, but dry weather in recent weeks has forced the Australian government to slash its crop forecasts by 30%.</p></blockquote>
<p>It struck me that unlimited credit expansion has an appeal because it will be successful for awhile, even a few years for the players, but HAS TO fail in any one year when market forces somehow come together to restrict the three laws of unlimited credit expasion Old Vet proposed.</p>
<p>Farmers gamble also, but the market has more limits and is not as elastic. But farmers also fail sometimes. There is just no glamor, and the pizza you order is pretty mundane looking&#8230;unless you can&#8217;t get one.</p>
<p>If you are going to invest, take a look at <a href="http://www.localharvest.org/csa/">CommunitySupported Agriculture</a> (CSA&#8217;s) to take on a portion of the risk to feed your family. It might even be healthier for you. There are two locally I know of, but you need to look around in your own locality.</p>
<p>And why is it farmers have no status?</p>

<p>Trying to get beyond today’s headlines, and the moves and countermoves in today’s markets, is difficult. However the future beckons, and it’s looking a lot more “deflationary” than “inflationary” which is the exact reason the Fed is throwing around the power of the “lender of last resort.” Don’t want a Depression, do we?</p>
<p>The great de-leveraging of 2008 continues, in which credit market expansion reverses due to excessive credit extended to a myriad of parties who now have trouble paying. One aspect that is now rising to prominence in the banking and non-banking financial world are financial derivatives and counterparty risks borne between parties like banks, hedge funds, brokers, and securities dealers.</p>
<p>In 1996 the US banking system hardly knew derivative financial instruments, but these have proliferated through the following decade to the present day. Think of “vanilla extract” or condensed essence of the vanilla bean. Vanilla extract is the kitchen equivalent of financial debt derivatives to their underlying financial products such as mortgage debt, automobile debt, credit card debt, corporate bonds, interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts, over the counter or listed contracts of various kinds. Most derivatives are not traded in public markets but sold in private deals, which makes them hard to track and to evaluate.</p>
<p>Notional values are not actual cash values. The premise of derivatives transactions is that a small amount of real cash can be used to gain exposure to a large amount of notional dollars. Hence the leverage. The movement in the notional values ultimately determines the profit or loss of the underlying derivative contract. Therefore the cash risk exposure of the banks listed below indicate RELATIVE rather than absolute cash exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Trillion $ of notional derivative exposure</strong></p>
<p>JP Morgan        $91.7<br />Citicorp             $34.0<br />BofA                  $32.1<br />Bear Stearns    $13.4<br />Morgan Stanley $7.1<br />Wachovia          $5.2<br />Merrill              $4.6<br />HSBC                $4.4<br />Goldman          $2.0<br />Wells                 $1.0<br />Bank Of NY     $1.0<br />Lehman           $0.7<br />(10-K data)</p>
<p>In the US banking system, exposure to financial derivatives proliferated but was then reduced by “laying off” or sharing risk with counter parties. It is called “bilateral netting.” The rough amount of derivatives laid off to counterparties rose from 45% of derivatives in 1996 to 85% in 2007. Thus counter party risk is the issue in the mysterious world of derivatives. How solid are your counterparties?</p>
<p>Bilateral netting is essentially the degree or magnitude of financial risk exposure laid off to counter parties. Counter parties such as other banks, perhaps a hedge fund or three, an insurance company, and even a broker such as Bear Stearns. Wait a minute, Bear Stearns? One and the same.</p>
<p>The financial derivatives world is held together by <strong>three critical assumptions:</strong></p>
<p>1. Always available liquidity (meaning plenty of cash in the hands of buyers),</p>
<p>2. 100% solvency of counter parties (meaning capacity to pay debts), and</p>
<p>3. A continuous market (no freezes, breaks, or discontinuities please)</p>
<p>Oops. All three of these assumptions have been violated recently in one degree or another, and the Federal Reserve Bank has stepped in.</p>
<p>Up until now we have seen many a &#8220;temporary&#8221; liquidity or asset swap action on the part of the Fed. Next up in this ongoing chain of events should indeed be some type of Fed sponsored monetization (the true printing of money, so to speak, which really has not yet occurred in its most pure form and in magnitude). As of today, the money printing sequence has not yet blossomed in full form as apparently the Fed is scared of nearer term dollar and global commodity price consequences. That may be changing if “runs” on financial institutions continue, as they must in order for the great Credit Cycle to turn towards less leverage.</p>
<p>Consequences ahead? Maybe a bailout fund, or using Fannie and Freddie as bailout funds, or the Fed simply buying crappy financial derivatives and “products.” Replacing them with cash to insolvent institutions, something well beyond merely increasing liquidity (cash) in the system. It’s what markets really want, Big Daddy to come in and take away their cares, and tell them their sins of greed and extravagance will be lifted away.</p>
<p>I really don’t know what that means for stocks, the US dollar, for prices of anything we buy, or anything we sell. But I’m sure that it will become clear if the Fed takes the next step, which is a doozy.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2008/03/clueless.html">Clueless</a> is how Hilzoy terms the latest from John McCain.  The <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/03/18/a_mccain_gaffe_in_jordan.html">Washington Post</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. John McCain, traveling in the Middle East to promote his foreign policy expertise, misidentified in remarks Tuesday which broad category of Iraqi extremists are allegedly receiving support from Iran. He said several times that Iran, a predominately Shiite country, was supplying the mostly Sunni militant group, al-Qaeda. In fact, officials have said they believe Iran is helping Shiite extremists in Iraq.  Speaking to reporters in Amman, the Jordanian capital, McCain said he and two Senate colleagues traveling with him continue to be concerned about Iranian operatives &#8220;taking al-Qaeda into Iran, training them and sending them back.&#8221; Pressed to elaborate, McCain said it was &#8220;common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al-Qaeda is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq from Iran, that&#8217;s well known. And it&#8217;s unfortunate.&#8221; A few moments later, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, standing just behind McCain, stepped forward and whispered in the presidential candidate&#8217;s ear. McCain then said: &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, the Iranians are training extremists, not al-Qaeda.&#8221; The mistake threatened to undermine McCain&#8217;s argument that his decades of foreign policy experience make him the natural choice to lead a country at war with terrorists. In recent days, McCain has repeatedly said his intimate knowledge of foreign policy make him the best equipped to answer a phone ringing in the White House late at night.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hilzoy notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s important to be clear about exactly how clueless this is. It&#8217;s like saying that some neo-confederate group is secretly funneling money to Louis Farrakhan, and then having an aide have to whisper: no, no, it&#8217;s the Aryan Nation; wrong extremists! It&#8217;s like suggesting that McCain is making a play for Kucinich voters, and having to be told that, no, you really meant Ron Paul: wrong losing candidate! No one who had any understanding at all of Iraq, or for that matter about the Shi&#8217;a/Sunni split and which side Iran was on, would get confused about this, any more than someone with any knowledge of US politics would get confused about whether neo-confederates were likely to be supporting blacks, or conservatives were likely to be supporting the Socialist Workers&#8217; Party. It is exactly that clueless.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hilzoy continues as to the political ramifications if the press and the public ever catch on that John McCain has a poor grasp of what really is going on with respect to foreign policy.  Foreign policy expertise is supposed to be his strong suit according to some pundits.  But quite frankly, this guy makes a George W. Bush ala 2000 actually look smart.  As bellicose as Dick Cheney and as clueless as George W. Bush – not a good combination for our next President.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/184135.php">Josh Marshall</a> continues the conversation:</p>
<blockquote><p>In almost every discussion of foreign policy, not just today but in previous years, what stands out is McCain&#8217;s inability to see beyond the immediate issues of military tactics to any firm grasp of strategy or America&#8217;s real vital interests. His free willingness to commit to a decades long occupation of Iraq is an example, his push for ground troops to be introduced during the Kosovo War is another. His refusal, almost inability, to grapple with the political failure of the surge is the most telling one if people will sift through its deeper implications. The idea that fighting jihadists in Iraq or policing the country&#8217;s sectarian and ethnic disputes is the calling of this century is one that is belied in virtually everything we see in flux in today&#8217;s world and which seems certain to affect us through the rest of our lifetimes and our children&#8217;s … Hillary Clinton has stipulated to McCain&#8217;s qualifications as Commander-in-Chief; and Obama, implicitly, does the same. But his record actually shows he&#8217;s one of the most dangerous people we could have in the Oval Office in coming years &#8212; not just because he&#8217;s a hothead in using the military, but more because he seems genuinely clueless about the real challenges and dangers the country is facing. He&#8217;s too busy living in the fantasy world where our future as a great power and our very safety are all bound up in Iraq.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>There are two ways of looking at the rising cost of oil: From the point of view of the economist, who considers oil as a commodity similar to pork bellies, and from the point of view of someone familiar with the physics and the geology of oil.</p>
<p>Take, for example, two recent posts. The first is <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser">Jeffrey Frankel&#8217;s</a> guest post on Brad Setser&#8217;s blog. The second is <a href="http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3707#more">Robert Rapier&#8217;s</a> on the Oil Drum.</p>
<p>Both offer radically different explanations of the rising cost of oil. (Frankel expands his explanation to include the rising cost of all commodities. For the purposes of this post, I will treat just oil as a commodity.)</p>
<p>Frankel argues that interest rates are a key determinant of a commodity&#8217;s price. High interest rates &#8220;reduce the demand&#8221; for storable commodities, such as oil.</p>
<p>If interest rates are high, he argues, then the rate of extraction will increase. Similarly, firms will less likely want to incur the cost of carrying inventory. And, finally, speculators will move away from &#8220;spot commodity contracts and into treasury bills.&#8221; Consequently, high interest rates reduce the cost of commodities.</p>
<p>If interest rates are low, then the obverse must happen. The cost of carrying inventory is cheaper; therefore, put more oil in the bank for a rainy day. Less oil consequently is in the market place. Firms are willing to carry a larger inventory. And, of course, speculators move in.<br />As for present realities, Frankel concludes that high commodity prices are a direct result of lower interest rates. In short, there is an abundance of each type of commodity; it is just being warehoused, driving up the price.</p>
<p>Of course, the Fed is busy lowering interest rates. One might conclude that such actions would continue to drive up the cost of commodities, a kind of vicious circle. As we lose more and more jobs and as the sub prime disaster hits more and more people, the Fed, in order to save the markets and the banks, is lowering interest rates&#8211;thus making it ever more difficult for average people to meet their bills. Thus we will starve, as mountains of plenty idly stay warehoused.</p>
<p>Now, the cynic in me, sort of likes this explanation. However, I do not think it fully approaches realities on the ground and in the field.</p>
<p>Rapier offers an entirely different approach to the cost of oil. The real cost of oil is directly connected to the cost required to extract it. He explains clearly and concisely the implications of EROIE (Energy Returned on Invested Energy).</p>
<p>Before I turn to his explanation, I wish to make two preliminary points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Oil is the lynch pin of our world. The cost of everything, and I mean everything , is tied to it: from cabbages to cars, from light bulbs to plastic containers, from the cost of fertilizer to the production of iron. Oil is required to make plastic products, even fertilizer. Global transportation depends on it. A sizable chunk of production depends upon the energy oil supplies, to say nothing of our electricity and heat.</li>
<li>As the world becomes increasingly populated, more and more people depend upon it. According to the U.N., in 2000 the world was adding 79 million people each year. That means, since 2000, the world has added one country whose population is the equivalent of the United States. While fertility rates in the developed world are decelerating, <i>not static or falling</i>, the developing world continues its rapid growth.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rapier offers two equations that have important bearing on the cost of oil.</p>
<ol>
<li>EROIE = Energy Input/Energy Output.</li>
<li>Net Energy=Energy Output &#8211; Energy Input</li>
</ol>
<p>The first equation is a ratio between the energy used to extract oil and the energy that oil provides. The larger the ratio, the more efficient the extraction is. And, it goes without saying, the cheaper the oil should be.</p>
<p>The second equation measures net energy. Similarly, the larger the number, the cheaper the oil should be.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.physics.otago.ac.nz/eman/documents/commons%20revisited%20tragedy%20continues.pdf">Bob Lloyd</a>, physicist at the Otago University, asserts that the concept of EROIE is not new. Anyone familiar the first law of thermodynamics understands it. But, because oil has seemingly been so inexpensive to extract, we have neglected the reality of EROIE. Oil has become a commodity similar to pork bellies, as if it were renewable or as if the cost of its creation were static.</p>
<p>The actual cost of oil extraction, in fact, is growing increasingly more expensive. Initially, the cost of extraction was ridiculously cheap. As Matt Simmons is fond of saying, a glass of oil was cheaper than a glass of bottled water&#8230; still is.</p>
<p>Texas oil in the 1930&#8217;s had an EROIE of 1 to 100. It&#8217;s EROIE was 1/100&#8211;very nice ratio. Similary, the Net Energy was 99. These numbers tell us that in the 1930&#8217;s oil was very inexpensive to extract.</p>
<p>In the 1970&#8217;s EROIE was 1/30 with Net Energy at 29, three times more expensive, but still ok.</p>
<p>Today, EROIE is at 1/15 with Net Energy at 14. In absolute terms, the cost of extraction is six times more expensive than in 1930.</p>
<p>Now consider the Canadian Tar Sands. Fort McHenry is booming; everyone, including the Norwegians and the Chinese want a piece of the action. Something is happening, for if you consider the actual EROIE of the tar sands, you will understand what I mean.</p>
<p>A report to the legislative leaders and governor of Connecticut <a href="http://www.housedems.ct.gov/Backer/TsandOSfina.pdf">concluded</a> that the actual EROIE of the tar sands is 1/3, with Net Energy of 2. In other words, it takes the energy equivalent of one barrel of oil to produce three barrels. The report points out that shale in the Wyoming-Utah-Colorado area has the same EROIE as tar sands oil.</p>
<p>Between 1930 and 2008, the EROIE of oil increased over thirty fold, from 1/100 to 1/3. Net energy has gone from 99 to 2.</p>
<p>Again, consider the popularity of the tar sands, a veritable oil rush&#8230;the last great frontier. That popularity attests to the fact that oil elsewhere will not meet rising demand; that shortfalls are in the offing. In this case, the market is telling us something important.</p>
<p>Consider also that we have not included the enormous environmental costs in terms of water pollution and deforestation. Approximately two barrels of water are required for every barrel of oil. Those two barrels are toxic, difficult to dispose safely. Right now, EROIE stands at 1/3. What happens when the energy for clean up becomes imperative? That EROIE may be as high as 1/2&#8230;or higher. What will be the cost then?</p>
<p>While these two radically different explanations may not be entirely mutually exclusive, they do look at different aspects of the problem. The first, Frankel&#8217;s, seems to explain small price movements within a narrow time scale. The second, Rapier&#8217;s, looks at a larger trend over a broader time scale.</p>
<p>Both explanations have merit, but in final analysis, I think Rapier&#8217;s more closely fits where we are going.</p>

                                <p>Reader sammy sends this link from the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120579841626143539.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">WSJ editorials page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thebest thing about Sunday night&#8217;s Federal Reserve-inspired sale of Bear Stearns to J.P. Morgan Chase is the price. At $2 a share for a total of $236 million, this was less a &#8220;bailout&#8221; than a Fed-mediated liquidation sale. Bear wasn&#8217;t too big to fail after all, though there&#8217;s still the issue of the Fed expanding its own moral and financial hazard in the form of $30 billion in guarantees on Bear Stearns securities.</p>
<p>Bear shareholders will essentially be wiped out in this close-out sale, with British billionaire Joseph Lewis alone reportedly enduring paper losses of $800 million on his 9.6% stake. Even on Wall Street, that&#8217;s real money. Jimmy Cayne, the Bear Chairman and former CEO who supervised this disaster, will lose a bundle on his nearly 5% holding. This makes the Bear sale different from the Fed-managed Long-Term Capital Management rescue of a decade ago, when investors were left substantially intact. We doubt many bankers will look at Bear&#8217;s fate and claim there&#8217;s no punishment for financial error.</p>
<p>Bear employees, who hold about one third of its shares, are angry and grousing that they could get more cents on the equity dollar in Chapter 11. Some may even be inclined to vote against the sale, but then they&#8217;d have to find a market for that $30 billion in mortgage securities that no one wants to finance.</p>
<p>The hard capitalist truth is that Bear&#8217;s most senior managers have mainly themselves to blame. They bought their second or third homes with fabulous bonuses during the good times, and they must now endure the losses from Bear&#8217;s errant investment bets. Bear took particular pride in its risk management, but it let its standards slide in the hunt for higher returns during the mortgage mania earlier this decade. There&#8217;s no joy in seeing a venerable firm expire, but it has to happen if financial markets are going to have any discipline going forward.</p>
<p>As for J.P. Morgan and CEO Jamie Dimon, remind us to have him negotiate our next contract. He gets Bear&#8217;s best assets, including a Manhattan building said to be worth $1.4 billion by itself. Meantime, he gets the Fed to backstop Bear&#8217;s riskiest paper. We don&#8217;t know the quality of that paper &#8212; and we hope the Fed has done its due diligence &#8212; but taxpayers are now on the hook for future losses. Some previous Fed officials might have told Mr. Dimon to take all of Bear or nothing at that $2 liquidation price, but Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner of the New York Fed seem to have been desperate to get a sale announced before markets opened on Monday. Mr. Dimon took them to school.</p>
<p>The Fed is also opening its discount window even further to non-deposit-taking institutions, and for an open-ended amount of lending and mortgage-based collateral. We endorsed this last week as a way of reviving a frozen market in mortgage-related securities. But with its Sunday move, the Fed is going all in. This raises genuine issues of moral hazard. Commercial banks traditionally have access to the discount window &#8212; that is, to public money &#8212; because they are regulated and have certain reporting and capital obligations.</p>
<p>Will investment banks and securities dealers now have to meet similar obligations if they tap the window? If they don&#8217;t, then it&#8217;s unfair to the banks that do, not to mention the taxpayers who are lending them the money. Goldman Sachs or Lehman may not want to meet those terms, but they should be asked to do so.</p>
<p>This new risk-taking is an extraordinary expansion of the Fed&#8217;s traditional crisis role, and not one to be taken lightly. In talking to central bank veterans yesterday, we were told the Fed has never taken a material loss. Even as a lender of last resort, the central bank has always made sure it had appropriate collateral.</p>
<p>If this latest effort does help to revive the mortgage credit markets, then the Fed&#8217;s potential losses may never be realized. On the other hand, no one knows how far housing prices will fall, and steeper declines in home prices will mean steeper losses in mortgage-backed securities. Moreover, if this doesn&#8217;t work, Wall Street pressure will build for the Fed to buy up mortgage securities wholesale. This could end up ruining the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet, and ultimately its credibility as the lender of last resort.</p>
<p>The Fed is making these commitments under the authority of a Depression-era statute that has rarely, if ever, been invoked. While Congress will tread warily while the financial crisis lasts, hoping the elixir works, you can bet it will eventually investigate this brave new Fed world. Let&#8217;s hope the biggest losers are Bear Stearns shareholders, not American taxpayers.</p></blockquote>

<p>As we all eagerly await the Fed’s decision on what Fed rate to set today, after taking crud as collateral from Bear Stearns on a non-recourse basis, and opening unlimited lending against further crud mortgage backed securities from everybody and his brother except Cactus and me, I have been looking for fresh ideas. Here’s an idea I found on the Web in a comment:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The banks forgive part of the principal and in return they receive a like percentage share of the equity. Forgive 10% of the principal and own 10% of the house. This wouldn’t help them raise any cash, and the house sale could be years off. So maybe they could aggregate all their equity shares and then sell them to investors. They could call these, say, “Phantom Equity Securitization Obligations,” or PESOs” for short.<br />“Now, what could these investors do with their new PESOs? Maybe they could sort of dice them up into differing quality levels and sell some sort of pieces of them. They could have say, three different levels and sell their “Pieces of Three,” or POT, shares.&#8221;</p>

<p>If anyone dealing with securitized mortgages believed that because it was real estate, it would never go bad, they should have been fired long ago; after decades in which the norm has been that housing matches inflation, anyone who believed that this time it&#8217;s different deserves whatever criticisms we throw their way.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB120511973377523845.html">The WSJ online</a> reports the following about our discussion of domestic NSA surveillance:</p>
<blockquote><p>Largely missing from the public discussion is the role of the highly secretive NSA in analyzing that data, collected through little-known arrangements that can blur the lines between domestic and foreign intelligence gathering. Supporters say the NSA is serving as a key bulwark against foreign terrorists and that it would be reckless to constrain the agency&#8217;s mission. The NSA says it is scrupulously following all applicable laws and that it keeps Congress fully informed of its activities.<br />According to current and former intelligence officials, the spy agency now monitors huge volumes of records of domestic emails and Internet searches as well as bank transfers, credit-card transactions, travel and telephone records. The NSA receives this so-called &#8220;transactional&#8221; data from other agencies or private companies, and its sophisticated software programs analyze the various transactions for suspicious patterns. Then they spit out leads to be explored by counterterrorism programs across the U.S. government, such as the NSA&#8217;s own Terrorist Surveillance Program, formed to intercept phone calls and emails between the U.S. and overseas without a judge&#8217;s approval when a link to al Qaeda is suspected.<br />The NSA&#8217;s enterprise involves a cluster of powerful intelligence-gathering programs, all of which sparked civil-liberties complaints when they came to light. They include a Federal Bureau of Investigation program to track telecommunications data once known as Carnivore, now called the Digital Collection System, and a U.S. arrangement with the world&#8217;s main international banking clearinghouse to track money movements.<br />The effort also ties into data from an ad-hoc collection of so-called &#8220;black programs&#8221; whose existence is undisclosed, the current and former officials say. Many of the programs in various agencies began years before the 9/11 attacks but have since been given greater reach. Among them, current and former intelligence officials say, is a longstanding Treasury Department program to collect individual financial data including wire transfers and credit-card transactions.<br />It isn&#8217;t clear how many of the different kinds of data are combined and analyzed together in one database by the NSA. An intelligence official said the agency&#8217;s work links to about a dozen anti terror programs in all.<br />A number of NSA employees have expressed concerns that the agency may be overstepping its authority by veering into domestic surveillance. And the constitutional question of whether the government can examine such a large array of information without violating an individuals reasonable expectation of privacy &#8220;has never really been resolved,&#8221; said Suzanne Spaulding, a national-security lawyer who has worked for both parties on Capitol Hill.<br />NSA officials say the agency&#8217;s own investigations remain focused only on foreign threats, but it&#8217;s increasingly difficult to distinguish between domestic and international communications in a digital era, so they need to sweep up more information.</p></blockquote>
<p>There apparently is no oversight of data kept and data used. The NSA is extraordinarily secretive currently. The DOJ also has its own agendas it appears. And the truth-imploda-meter appears to be having a difficult time keeping up with the times. &#8216;Trust me&#8217; is actually making me quite worried as a reasonable response.</p>
