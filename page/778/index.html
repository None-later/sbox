                                <p>My series looking at a lot of different factors (from the economy to abortion) moved under Presidential administrations beginning with Ike has drawn a lot of criticism in private correspondence, comments on my posts, and even on the occasional post by other bloggers.   The problem, its seems, is that on most of these factors, the American public seems to fare better, on average, during Democratic Administrations than under Republican administrations.    That is not to say its been true on all series for all Democratic Administrations, but there does seem to be a difference &#8211; even now that I&#8217;ve for the most part stopped mentioning party affiliation at all (the Ex-GF suggested leaving it as the elephant in the living room, so to speak), simply putting up a graph that shows the performance of Presidents next to each other seems to be suggestive enough to be offensive or bad form. </p>
<p>So this post is about the criticism.  And I note I&#8217;ve had a lot of time to think about it&#8230; its been going on for a while, although in fairness, the criticism has evolved.  In the beginning, the criticism was that I had to be cherry-picking series (I started, as I recall, with real GDP per capita!) and that if I just went a bit wider, the discrepancy would disappear.  It didn&#8217;t.  Over time, the criticism evolved into a collection of excuses for the observed discrepancy.  Regular readers know I went through a whole series of posts looking at each of the excuses &#8211; Congress did it, its due to lags, Republicans inherit worse economies, the Fed did it, going back further (to FDR) kills it, Republicans simply get elected when the public senses times are about to get bad, the results don&#8217;t hold up using textbook statistical methods, etc.  None of the excuses held up.  But I checked &#8211; every single one of them.  This took a lot of time and effort.  There have been a few more minor evolutions, but as this series gets more and more complete, and as I begin trying to modify them (with a co-author who currently wishes to remain nameless) in order to put them in book form, the criticism has taken on a new form.  I want to focus on that new form.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s begin with an example &#8211; <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/10/home_sweet_home_equity.php">this post by Megan McArdle</a> is representative.  In particular,</p>
<blockquote><p>Cactus defends the notion that, once again, electing any president who is a Democrat has special, magical effects on desirable economic variables such as the amount of equity people have in their homes. The problem with this, as with most of Cactus&#8217; other demonstrations of amazing Democratic presidential economic power, is that it gives us an Underpants Gnome theory of economic good:</p>
<p>1) Elect anyone who is a Democrat to the office of president</p>
<p>2) ???</p>
<p>3) Awesome economy!</p></blockquote>
<p>(Apologies &#8211; I don&#8217;t know how to get blogger to put the gray background on the numbered items as she did it.)</p>
<p>Underpants Gnome theory of economic good&#8230;  To quote Samuel L. Jackson&#8217;s character in Pulp Fiction, &#8220;Well, allow me to retort.&#8221;</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s a problem with the premise.  When did I ever pronounce the economy under Democratic administrations to be awesome?  My position &#8211; that Democrats are marginally less offensive than Republicans &#8211; has never been a secret.  Let me try an analogy&#8230;.   almost every morning, I go for a run &#8211; well, I jog for a while, and walk for a while.  I can&#8217;t jog too long or my knees will act up.  Other folks in the neighborhood jog too.  Now, anyone who observed the comings and goings in the neighborhood could probably figure out who they should bet on if we all participated in a 5K.  Pointing out that the lanky 28 year old who runs with a dog could beat the pants out of the rest of us who amble about in the morning is not the equivalent of saying he&#8217;s an awesome runner.</p>
<p>To extend the analogy&#8230; I think a couple of the administrations did some serious training&#8230;  JFK/LBJ brought in the technocrats, and Clinton was famous for the late night meetings in which policy details were hashed out and pizza was consumed.  But GW has a well-deserved reputation for being on vacation  &#8211; even when he&#8217;s not on vacation, when something happens we find out later he has to be informed later because he was out mountain biking at the time.  Ike had a reputation of being out to golf, and Reagan would be the vacation leader in a world where GW didn&#8217;t exist.  Contrast that with Carter, the (on most series) worst performing Democrat &#8211; he was derided as a micromanager who went so far as to determine who got to use the tennis court and when.   In general, Presidents from Party seem to have taken a hands-on approach, and Presidents from the other have publicly stated that government is the problem &#8211; when they weren&#8217;t trying to dismantle it, they were leaving it alone to run itself.  Returning to the running analogy &#8211; one group of weekend warriors tries to jog every morning, the other considers eating donuts Monday through Friday and some time spent on the golf course on the weekend to be adequate training for the LA Marathon.  And Megan McArdle thinks there&#8217;s something wrong with anyone would bet on the first group to do better, on average, than the second group.</p>
<p>So much for the awesome economy, but this may go some ways toward explaining the &#8220;2) ???&#8221; as well. </p>
<p>Which brings up another point&#8230; I&#8217;ve tried to explain the differences before.  As noted&#8230; I looked at every excuse and explanation for the difference that readers suggested, and tried to see if it fit the data.  I came up with ideas of my own &#8211; I noted that the change in real M2 per capita precedes the change in real GDP per capita, and the correlation between the two series is very, very high.  But even the Fed as an answer doesn&#8217;t work&#8230; the Fed&#8217;s policy toward Republicans (with the notable exception of its policy toward those named George Herbert Walker Bush) was more growth oriented than the Fed&#8217;s policy toward Democratic administrations.   So what is left?  Policy?  Luck?  Anything else?</p>
<p>Well, maybe I&#8217;m fudging the data. In my posts, I link directly to the data&#8230; I believe in all but one of them, my source for the data was the government agency most closely associated with that particular set of data.  I make it quite easy to check, and to call me on fudged data.  And every so often, a reader points out a mistake, and I put up a correction.  But its happening less, fortunately &#8211; as I&#8217;ve automated the process, its harder to screw up.  </p>
<p>I could go on, but I want to cover one more thing&#8230;  even if I made no attempt to explain the difference, I think the series has value.  I think there is some value in simply understanding what is going on, even if one doesn&#8217;t know why.  One can&#8217;t come up with an adequate theory if one is simply way wrong about what happened.   Getting the facts more or less right is important to coming up with a useful theory to explain them.  Perhaps simply compiling the facts and organizing them into a visual, easy to understand way would be enough (assuming that really was all that I was trying to do). </p>
<p>But I want to come back to where I started, and to turn it around.  In the end, I think the problem is with the results.  I think the Megan McArdles of this world wouldn&#8217;t have much of a problem if all these series showed a random mix of Presidents, or showed the Republicans coming out on top.  They are looking for confirmation of their beliefs, of that theory that sprang into existence and moves through the world completely untouched by facts &#8211; that government really doesn&#8217;t matter except to drag down the economy, or at least, that those who talk up small government are the ones who govern best.  And there is intense frustration at seeing their views not only not confirmed, but also contradicted.</p>
<p>So as (apparently) the leading proponent of the &#8220;Underpants Gnome theory of economic good&#8221; &#8211; I want to at least point out that, even as Megan McArdle defines it, that theory makes more sense than following <a href="http://www.health.uottawa.ca/biomech/csb/laws/science.htm">Maier&#8217;s Law</a>.</p>

                                <p>Several months ago I predicted a water war in the next decade.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of Americans have or are migrating to the southern and western states,<br />where there are many areas of chronic water shortages (duh).</p>
<p>Now Governor Bill Richardson has fired the first shot, suggesting a national water policy, which is shorthand for stealing water from the Great Lakes. Rustbelters are outraged, some suggesting we sell Richardson water at $80.00 a barrel.</p>
<p>Vegas, probably the fastest growing area in the country, is sucking as much from the Colorado as it can, and will still have major shortages, perhaps within months.</p>
<p>The Great Lakes are in a low cycle and any diversion would probably be an ecological disaster.</p>
<p>Beyond that,  should those in the midwest pay for the bad judgments of many other citizens and public officials?</p>
<p>(Most of the Democrats are refusing to set foot in Michigan because it has an early primary, and ignoring Ohio because of a late primary. Maybe they can get water from New Hampshire.)</p>
<p>Individuals and businesses are welcome to move back to the Great Lakes area, where there is plenty of water, plenty of electricity and inexpensive housing.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/12/AR2007101202485_2.html?hpid=topnews">CEO Nacchio of Qwest</a> has a write up in WAPO:</p>
<blockquote><p>A former Qwest Communications International executive, appealing a conviction for insider trading, has alleged that the government withdrew opportunities for contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars after Qwest refused to participate in an unidentified National Security Agency program that the company thought might be illegal.</p>
<p>Former chief executive Joseph P. Nacchio, convicted in April of 19 counts of insider trading, said the NSA approached Qwest more than six months before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to court documents unsealed in Denver this week.<br />Details about the alleged NSA program have been redacted.<br />&#8230;<br />The newly released court documents say that, on Feb. 27, 2001, Nacchio and James Payne, then Qwest&#8217;s senior vice president of government systems, met with NSA officials at Fort Meade, expecting to discuss &#8220;Groundbreaker,&#8221; a project to outsource the NSA&#8217;s non-mission-critical systems.</p>
<p>The men came out of the meeting &#8220;with optimism about the prospect for 2001 revenue from NSA,&#8221; according to an April 9, 2007, court filing by Nacchio&#8217;s lawyers that was disclosed this week.</p>
<p>But the filing also claims that Nacchio &#8220;refused&#8221; to participate in some unidentified program or activity because it was possibly illegal and that the NSA later &#8220;expressed disappointment&#8221; about Qwest&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nacchio said it was a legal issue and that they could not do something that their general counsel told them not to do. . . . Nacchio projected that he might do it if they could find a way to do it legally,&#8221; the filing said.</p>
<p>Mike German, policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the documents show &#8220;that there is more to this story about the government&#8217;s relationship with the telecoms than what the administration has admitted to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurt Opsahl, senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said: &#8220;It&#8217;s inappropriate for the government to be awarding a contract conditioned upon an agreement to an illegal program. That truly is what&#8217;s going on here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The foundation has sued AT&#038;T, charging that it violated privacy laws by cooperating with the government&#8217;s warrantless surveillance program.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thinking about the issue raises several possiblities for me if reasonably true:</p>
<p>1. Efforts against terrorism were already underway before 9/11 and have come to light to bolster the Administration&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<p>2. The wiretapping is part of a different plan not yet revealed and was begun coincidentally with the terrorist threat as an extra incentive or cover.</p>
<p>3. It takes a crook to catch a crook.</p>
<p>4. Secret programs can be coercion, collusion, or a way to gain market share without the opportunity costs normally associated with new programs.</p>

                                <p>Expect the liberal bloggers to tell you about <a href="http://stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&#038;article=49460">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The former top commander of U.S. troops in Iraq slammed the handling of the war and gave a bleak assessment of the current situation in Iraq.  “There is no question that America is living a nightmare with no end in sight,” retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez told a convention of military journalists on Friday. Sanchez commanded U.S. troops in Iraq from June 2003 to July 2004. His controversial tenure saw the capture of Saddam Hussein and the handover of sovereignty to the Iraqi government, but also the rise of the insurgency and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.</p></blockquote>
<p>General Sanchez also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/washington/12cnd-general.html?hp">said</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>“There was been a glaring and unfortunate display of incompetent strategic leadership within our national leaders,” he said, adding later in his remarks that civilian officials have been “derelict in their duties” and guilty of a “lust for power.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – General Sanchez has the courage to tell us the truth.  OK, we all know what he says is true.  But would you be willing to put up with what we know will be the GOP slime machine attacking this man who was brave enough to serve in Iraq and also brave enough to tell the truth?  </p>
<p>Incidentally, I first heard this on CNN where a little sliming had already crept in.  No – I do not want to see what Faux News is going to do to this patriot.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/055867.php">Steve Benen</a> points to <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/iraq/20070923-9999-1n23generals.html">Mark Sauer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The generals acted independently, coming in their own ways to the agonizing decision to defy military tradition and publicly criticize the Bush administration over its conduct of the war in Iraq.   What might be called The Revolt of the Generals has rarely happened in the nation&#8217;s history.  In op-ed pieces, interviews and TV ads, more than 20 retired U.S. generals have broken ranks with the culture of salute and keep it in the family. Instead, they are criticizing the commander in chief and other top civilian leaders who led the nation into what the generals believe is a misbegotten and tragic war.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steve wonders if RUSH will tag these generals to be <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200709270010">phony soldiers</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>But the Associated press and the Obama campaign have seized on that, and characterized it as something of a flip flop, because Hillary Clinton criticized Barack Obama earlier this year when in a debate he said that he would meet in the first year of his presidency with a whole host of foreign despots, including Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro, and Ahmadinejad of Iran, and that he&#8217;d do so without conditions. Well, they claimed that Hillary Clinton suddenly embraced that position, but in truth she did not. Where Mr. Obama was talking about meeting with leaders in the first year of his administration, Hillary Clinton yesterday was talking about negotiations with Iran the country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazing!  I guess AP was shamed and decided to report this <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5izJr4wFXhrXfr8mlCBthgtCZvMcwD8S7EU6O0">accurately</a> after all. While Holly Ramer’s story says 17 hours ago – check the links from 2 hours ago.</p>

<blockquote><p>The richest Americans&#8217; share of national income has hit a postwar record, surpassing the highs reached in the 1990s bull market, and underlining the divergence of economic fortunes blamed for fueling anxiety among American workers. The wealthiest 1% of Americans earned 21.2% of all income in 2005, according to new data from the Internal Revenue Service. That is up sharply from 19% in 2004, and surpasses the previous high of 20.8% set in 2000, at the peak of the previous bull market in stocks.  The bottom 50% earned 12.8% of all income, down from 13.4% in 2004 and a bit less than their 13% share in 2000.The IRS data, based on a large sample of tax returns, are for &#8220;adjusted gross income,&#8221; which is income after some deductions, such as for alimony and contributions to individual retirement accounts. While dated, many scholars prefer it to timelier data from other agencies because it provides details of the very richest &#8212; for example, the top 0.1% and the top 1%, not just the top 10% &#8211; and includes capital gains, an important, though volatile, source of income for the affluent. The IRS data go back only to 1986, but academic research suggests the rich last had this high a share of total income in the 1920s.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="">Lawrence Kudlow</a> reacts:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m surprised that today’s Wall Street Journal story on income inequality failed to mention that while the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans earned 21.2 percent of all incomes in 2005, they now pay nearly 40 percent of all taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>All taxes?</strong>  While Kudlow wants to spin the numbers, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_10/012212.php">Kevin Drum</a> is more interesting in providing reliable information.  The Cliff Note version of what Kevin said has this:</p>
<blockquote><p>So the tax system is moderately progressive until you get up to the 5,000 richest people in the country, at which point it becomes regressive. However, this includes only federal income tax and payroll taxes. It doesn&#8217;t include excise taxes, state income taxes, sales taxes, or property taxes. If you add in all that stuff, things get even flatter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin later reported on some data given to him by <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_10/012220.php">The Tax Foundation</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Tax Foundation may be a conservative outfit (they&#8217;re the ones who bring you &#8220;Tax Freedom Day&#8221; every year), but they emailed to let me know that they produced a report of their own last year showing overall tax rates at various income levels. It shows that federal taxes are progressive, state taxes are about flat, and total taxes are modestly progressive. Basically, the tax rate for the average worker is 28% while the tax rate for the richest taxpayers is 34% (and probably a bit lower than that for the very richest taxpayers).</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep – Kudlow just makes shit up and the National Review lets him post it.  Go figure.</p>

<blockquote><p>The decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Al Gore and environmental scientists has incensed some CNN.com readers while pleasing others. While Robert Ellis of Ohio says the award is &#8220;well-deserved&#8221;, Matthew Whitley of North Carolina says the peace prize is now a &#8220;laughingstock.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The actual story was not much better:</p>
<blockquote><p>CNN.com asked readers to share their thoughts on the Nobel Prize, global warming and Gore&#8217;s selection. The response was overwhelming. Many readers offered congratulations to the former vice president, while others expressed disdain for him. Some readers said it was a poor choice, while others flat out dismissed global warming as pseudoscience. Below is a selection of those responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity:</p>
<p>Roy Woodcock of Rochester, Washington<br />What a disgraceful choice. Al Gore has promoted bad science and dishonesty, but done nothing to promote peace. I must conclude that his selection is based on pure politics.</p>
<p>George Burns of Shrewsbury, Massachusetts<br />I can only imagine how upset Bill &#8220;looking for my legacy&#8221; Clinton is that he didn&#8217;t win it. Mr. Clinton really thought he had a chance at it when he tried to broker piece between [Yasser] Arafat and [Ehud] Barak. Arafat, another Nobel Peace Prize winner, rejected Barak&#8217;s offer of everything Arafat wanted. &#8230; Jimmy Carter, another Nobel Peace Prize winner, got North Korea to &#8220;promise&#8221; to terminate their nuclear weapons program. How&#8217;d that work out?</p></blockquote>
<p>OK – the next one was congratulatory but that was followed by reactions from two other rightwingers.  I would suspect that one might do better polling those who listen to Rush Limbaugh. Global warming is real and Al Gore has shown courage and foresight.  But what does CNN do?  Interview the Swift Boat crowd.  Pathetic!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: And I thought CNN was pathetic.  I forgot about the National Review crowd.  <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTA0MjgyNTdjYzRjY2EwNDFjMzA4ODU4YzZjZDFiOWY=">Iain Murray</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>How about that well known peace campaigner Osama Bin Laden, who implicitly endorsed Gore&#8217;s stance &#8211; and that of the Nobel committee &#8211; in his September rant from the cave</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MWVmNzBiM2YxZWNjZTkxOGJjNGRiNmRhN2YzYzhmMzc=">Mark Levin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can&#8217;t think of anyone who has done more to bring peace to this world &#8211; from Rwanda to the Sudan, from Burma to North Korea &#8211; than Al Gore.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MTIzNjE1NTQwZTc3ZmNmOTk4NWRlNzZkYmY2NTNmMzk=">KLo</a> provides a picture.  She earlier agreed with Rush Limbaugh that the prize should go to <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZDcwYzNjOWU5ZmU1OGE1NTM4NDg1MzcyNzk2ZmQ3YWU=">General Petraus</a>.</p>
<p>Lacking an ounce of intelligence, one would think they’d have just a little class.  Well, at least today they are beating up on an adult and not some 12-year old kid!</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/10/the-first-time-.html">Wired&#8217;s Danger Zone</a>, an op ed in the Chicago Trib by Robert Bateman, a US Infantry Officer who served in Iraq in 2005 and 2006.  Its called <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-oped1012contractoroct12,0,4399312.story">Blackwater and me: A love story it ain&#8217;t</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know something about Blackwater USA. This opinion is both intellectually driven as well as moderately emotional. You see, during my own yearlong tour in Iraq, the bad boys of Blackwater twice came closer to killing me than did any of the insurgents or Al Qaeda types. That sort of thing sticks with you. One story will suffice to make my point.</p>
<p>The first time it happened was in the spring of 2005. For various reasons, none of which bear repeating, I was moving through downtown Baghdad in an unmarked civilian sedan. I was with two other men, but they had the native look, while I was in my uniform, hunched in the back seat and partially covered by a blanket, hoping that the curtains on the window were enough to conceal my incongruous presence, not to mention my weapons. It was not the normal manner in which an Army infantry major moved around the city, but it was what the situation called for, so there I was. We were in normal Baghdad traffic, with the flow such as it was, in the hubbub of confusion that is generated when you suddenly introduce more than 1 million extra vehicles in the course of two years into a city that previously had only a few hundred thousand vehicles, and no real licensing authority.</p>
<p>As we approached one semi-infamous intersection along the main route used by Blackwater between the International Zone (a.k.a. the Green Zone) and the Ministry of Interior, one of Blackwater&#8217;s convoys roared through. Apparently, Blackwater&#8217;s agents did not like the look of us, the main body of cars in front of them. Their response was, to say the least, contrary to the best interests of the United States effort in Iraq. Barreling through in their huge, black armored Suburbans and Expeditions, they drove other cars onto the sidewalk even as they popped off rounds from at least one weapon, though I cannot say if the shots were aimed at us or fired into the sky as a warning. I do know one thing: It enraged me &#8230; and Blackwater is, at least nominally, on our side.</p>
<p>But imagining that incident from an Iraqi perspective made it clear to me that though Blackwater USA draws its paycheck from Uncle Sam, it&#8217;s not working in Uncle Sam&#8217;s best interests. If I was this angry, I can only imagine the reactions of the tens of thousands of Iraqis who encounter Blackwater personnel on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Iraq operates on the basis of an honor culture. Honor is, arguably, more important than Islam. Being dishonored, in word or deed, or even by implication, is enough to set the average Iraqi man to plotting his revenge. This is a culture in which political assassinations (usually based on honor issues) are not an abstraction but an everyday occurrence. Every time one of those Blackwater convoys drives an Iraqi civilian off the road because the most important thing in the world is the protection of their &#8220;principal,&#8221; they make a new enemy for the United States. Every time they ram another car to clear the way (and, yes, I&#8217;ve seen them do that), so that they could maintain their own speed and thereby minimize their exposure to &#8220;improvised explosive devices,&#8221; they make another enemy. Every time they kill innocent civilians, or wound them, they make whole families of new enemies.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve noted a lot of this before.  And I realize that apparently its asking a lot for Blackwater to be held for responsible for damage to Iraqis.  But as I&#8217;ve also noted, Blackwater&#8217;s M.O. is to ensure that the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/blackwater.html">average Iraqi can&#8217;t exactly distinguish between Blackwater and the US military</a>.  Which means that in effect, at least indirectly, Blackwater is also responsible for a lot of the deaths of US military personnel.  Why can&#8217;t they at least be held responsible for that?</p>

<blockquote><p>Cost reduction was the key benefit claimed by privatization. We conduct a meta analysis of all published econometric studies of water and waste production in cities since 1965. Little support is found for a link between privatization and cost savings. Cost savings are not found in water delivery and are not systematic in solid waste collection. Theoretical expectations for cost savings arise from the benefits of competition and the incentives of private ownership. However, empirical results show the importance of market structure, industrial organization of the service sector, and government management, oversight and regulation.</p>
<p>Most of the academic literature shows government contracting is a sensitive business that requires diligence, planning and management resources, and that it may be unsuited to certain goods and services. Additional rules for overseeing contracting processes may be necessary to ensure agencies prepare properly for contracting, and weigh all options for service provision. In Massachusetts, for example, a commission evaluates proposals for using private contractors prior to implementation.<br /><a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/4038/">In a separate paper</a>, Sclar found the commission saved money in Massachusetts by preventing inefficient contracting. He concluded:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The privatization law has created an atmosphere where state agencies are forced to think like private firms as opposed to assuming that a private provider working under contract will automatically solve any problem at a lower cost. It compels state agencies to think through the pitfalls that lie ahead and prods them to be sure they are making the highest and best use of scarce resources in difficult fiscal times. It avoids the squandering of public funds on untested ideas that has plagued privatization efforts in so many other places.</p>
<p>When agencies do not take it for granted that contracting is always efficient, they should be better prepared to manage contracts and may be more willing to reform service delivery systems by more effective means than privatization. At the very least, this research shows that policymakers have good reason to examine the cost-efficiency of the rapidly expanding federal contracting industry — which has doubled in size in the last five years. Any review of contracting practices should determine the conditions under which privatization is a viable way of improving government performance.</p></blockquote>
<p>A businessman uses rules of the market only, except when selling a product to increase volume of sales. Then he may rely on marketing, which is devised to sell anything. What or who is preventing rationality in government buying, even if one removes from the table the product is worth buying? No one appears able to tackle the issue?&#8230;or is it that procurement procedures are well insulated and protected? And why is this not more of an issue from all sides of the partisan divide?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong><br /><a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08122.pdf">A GAO analysis</a> of DOD medical service consolidation includes the following:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>However, based on the working group’s methodology, the group intended to conduct a more detailed cost-benefit analysis of whichever of the three options senior DOD leadership selected, but the group’s work ceased once the fourth option was formally approved. While DOD approved the fourth option, DOD has not demonstrated that its decision to move forward with the fourth option was based on a sound business case. Based on GAO’s review of DOD’s business case, DOD has described only what it believes its chosen option will accomplish. The business case does not demonstrate how DOD determined the fourth option to be better than the other three in terms of its potential impact on medical readiness, quality of care, beneficiaries’ access to care, costs, implementation time, and risks because DOD does not provide evidence of any analysis it has performed of the fourth option or a sound business case justifying this choice.</p></blockquote>
