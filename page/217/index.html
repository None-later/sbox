<p>Want a Flat Tax? I Got a Flat Tax for You</strong> <br />crossposted with <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/">Asymptosis</a></p>
<p>One percent of financial assets. Personal and corporate. Annually. </p>
<p>With somewhere north of <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/too-big-to-fail-wall-street-and-main-street-how-big-are-they.html">$55 trillion</a> in U.S. financial assets out there (2009, down from $63 trillion in 2007), a Financial Assets Tax would generate more than $550 billion in annual revenue. </p>
<p>What could we do with that revenue? Here are some options: 
<p>• Eradicate taxes on corporate profits, dividends, and capital gains, and cut income taxes by between 22% and 51%. (Depends on which tax year you&#8217;re looking at; this for 2007-09. NIPA Table 3.2.)</p>
<p>
<p>• Pay off some of our national debt, <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/government-investment-and-the-post-70s-prosperity-gap.html">invest in productive infrastructure</a> to build true national wealth, greatly <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=2896">expand the EITC</a> (and index it to unemployment) to turbocharge the real economy, or&#8230;</p>
<p>
<p>• Some equitable and economically efficient combination of the above</p>
<p>Why should we do this? <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Simple: greater prosperity and greater equality. Both. </p>
<p>This idea seems to have far greater upsides than downsides. But I&#8217;ve undoubtedly missed some things, which I hope my gentle readers will fill in. </p>
<p>Here are some of the issues involved:</p>
<p><strong>Innovation and growth.</strong> Naysayers (mostly &#8212; surprise! &#8212; large holders of financial assets) will scream that THIS PROPOSAL TAXES SAVINGS!!!, which for not-very-well-hidden and supposedly moralistic reasons is seen as BAD!!! (As my friend Gabriel in England said to me once, &#8220;Yes, well, we shipped all our Puritans over to you, now didn&#8217;t we?&#8221;)</p>
<p>Their <em>post-hoc</em> rationalization for that faux moralizing: savings are (more accurately: can be) used for investment, by which they mean (in this instance) fixed investment in productive assets &#8212; structures, equipment, software, etc. We want to encourage fixed investment, right? It drives growth (and long term, employment), and builds national wealth and prosperity, right? The answer to those questions is &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </p>
<p>But when they start objecting to the tax because it &#8220;will hurt poor people,&#8221; raise at least one eyebrow. First &#8212; as usual &#8212; they&#8217;re confusing flows with stocks. Savings is a flow. Money from savings goes into the stock of financial assets &#8212; cash in mattresses, bank account balances, CDs, stocks, bonds, collateralized debt obligations, etc. </p>
<p>But that misconception aside, talk about being wrong by 180 degrees. This proposal does indeed discourage saving &#8212; <em>in favor of real investment</em>. </p>
<p>Remember: there are only five things a person or company can do with a dollar of income: 
<p>1. Spend it on consumption (buy food or office supplies, pay wages for ongoing operations, etc.)</p>
<p>
<p>2. Invest it (to create or purchase &#8212; hence spur creation of &#8212; real assets)</p>
<p>
<p>3. Save it (&#8220;invest&#8221;/store it in financial assets &#8212; effectively or actually lending it out)</p>
<p>
<p>4. Pay off loans (basically saving, but on the other side of the balance sheet)</p>
<p>
<p>5. Pay taxes</p>
<p>If a dollar is &#8220;saved,&#8221; it is by definition <em>not</em> invested. (Though it or an identical, fungible equivalent might flow back out of the pool of financial assets to be spent on real investment &#8211;or on consumption, loan payoffs, or taxes.) </p>
<p>If people and companies sock away their income in financial &#8220;investments&#8221; (save it) and just enjoy the returns, one percent of those returns will be skimmed off every year. (Not terribly onerous, given that hedge-fund &#8220;investors&#8221; pay large multiples of that and still make piles of money for doing nothing.) </p>
<p>If, on the other hand, people and companies use that money to build houses, apartment buildings, malls, office buildings, amusement parks, and factories, invest in new equipment and software, or spend it on those deucedly hard-to-measure but massive contributors to our national asset base &#8212; education, training, research, and development &#8212; the assets they create <em>won&#8217;t </em>be hit by this tax. </p>
<p>And the <em>ongoing income</em> generated by those real assets will be taxed at a far lower rate. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the income that isn&#8217;t saved might be spent on consumption &#8212; increasing monetary velocity and aggregate demand, and making the whole swirling pie that is the economy, bigger. </p>
<p>If you think collateralized debt obligations are valuable national assets, you should hate this tax. If you think &#8212; correctly &#8212; that as Kuznets and many others have pointed out, real assets constitute true national wealth (though many of the most important real assets, like ideas, knowledge, skills, and &#8220;organizational capital,&#8221; are intangible and unmeasurable), you should love this tax. </p>
<p><strong>What do we mean by financial assets?</strong> There are some gray areas that would need to be sorted out (insurance, pensions, etc.), but most financial assets quack like ducks. For a quick list, take a look at the column headings in Table 2A the of the Fed&#8217;s <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/2009p/scf2009phome.html">analysis</a> of the Census&#8217;s 2009 Panel Survey of Consumer Finances (<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/2009p/FEDs_appendix_tables_final.xls">XLS</a>): 
<p>Transaction accounts <br />Certificates of deposit <br />Savings bonds Bonds <br />Stocks <br />Pooled <br />investment funds <br />Retirement accounts <br />Cash value life insurance <br />Other managed assets Other</p>
<p>We might even want to include cash (actual dollar or euro bills). Why should we encourage cash in mattresses? TBD. </p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://stevebroback.com/">Steve</a> tentatively suggested &#8220;anything that&#8217;s traded on an exchange,&#8221; which seems like a good idea except it would encourage Wall Streeters to move towards assets that are traded off-exchange, over the counter. We&#8217;ve seen the effects of that. </p>
<p><strong>What about incentives and economic distortions?</strong> How much would this tax distort economic decisions? Think: Nobody, ever, says &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to get wealthy because I&#8217;d have to pay taxes.&#8221; Why? Ask any of Jane Austen&#8217;s heroines: because there&#8217;s no substitute for wealth. </p>
<p>Earned income? Quite otherwise, because there&#8217;s a very good substitute for working to earn money: leisure. Spending time with the kids, playing golf, writing overly long and abstruse economic blog posts, watching NASCAR, assembling intricate miniatures of Civil War battle scenes. </p>
<p>In economic terms, the demand for employment is quite elastic because there&#8217;s an attractive substitute. The demand for wealth is quite inelastic, because there just ain&#8217;t no substitute for being rich. </p>
<p>The Financial Assets Tax would provide a very slightly lower incentive to earn money every year (anyone care to do the arithmetic?), but nothing like the disincentive that results (in theory, to some greater or lesser degree) from high marginal income tax rates, corporate profit and dividend taxes, etc. </p>
<p>The biggest incentive &#8212; arguably an economic &#8220;distortion,&#8221; but every tax except maybe land value taxes is distortionary &#8212; would be to spend on real investment (and consumption) instead of saving. </p>
<p>But that incentive would actually compensate for an inherent distortion resulting from the nature of financial assets, which are at root an artificial creation: Financial assets don&#8217;t decay and depreciate like real assets do. After ten years (or whatever), you still have the initial capital, plus the returns, which is not true with fixed investments. So fixed investments have a big disadvantage when they&#8217;re competing for &#8220;investment&#8221; dollars. A Financial Assets Tax would to some degree correct for that inherent market distortion/inefficiency. </p>
<p><strong>Too big to fail. </strong>  I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/too-big-to-fail-wall-street-and-main-street-how-big-are-they.html">pointed out</a> that the financial economy &#8212; the trade in financial assets &#8212; is many time larger (40x, 50x?) than the real economy &#8212; trade in goods and services. And it&#8217;s arguably many times larger than is necessary to lubricate and intermediate the real economy. And innumerable wise voices have pointed out the negative externalities of this excessive size: systemic risk of financial-market meltdowns that trash the real economy, gross misallocation of financial and human resources, etc. </p>
<p>There have been some salutary if rather timid proposals to address this via taxes on financial transactions &#8212; the flows &#8212; to compensate for those externalities and shrink the sector. But this proposal for taxing the <em>stock</em> of financial assets could be a superior alternative. I&#8217;ll leave it to others, for now, to analyze the pros and cons of those two alternatives. </p>
<p><strong>What about private residences?</strong> This is both a large segment of fixed investment, and kind of a special case &#8212; different from business investments because the value derived isn&#8217;t in the ability to produce more, saleable goods and services, but having a roof over your head. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the functional scenario: you&#8217;ve got half a million dollars in financial assets, and you want to build a half-million-dollar house. Here are the two ends of the spectrum &#8212; you can land anywhere in between: 
<p>1. Sell all your financial assets and spend the money to build the house.</p>
<p>
<p>2. Sell $50,000 of financial assets for the 10% down payment on a loan, and borrow the rest.</p>
<p>Your taxes on the house asset are the same either way. But in scenario 2, under the Financial Asset Tax proposal you also pay tax every year on the $450,000 in financial assets you&#8217;re still holding. So it&#8217;s less attractive. It effectively increases the interest rate on your loan by 1%. </p>
<p>Putting aside for the moment all the other factors you personally consider (liquidity, risk, return, peace of mind, etc.): which of these scenarios &#8212; if repeated by millions of people over decades &#8212; contributes more to national wealth and prosperity? Which should the tax system encourage? (Because every tax system encourages <em>something.</em>) </p>
<p>The first scenario reduces the value of financial assets by reducing demand for them; the second increases it. As Dirk Bezemer has <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/who-prints-money-and-who-gets-to-have-it-its-up-to-the-banks.html">explained</a>, borrowing-driven booms in financial asset values drain resources from the real economy, and so are associated with slower real-sector growth. The second scenario also effectively prints $450,000 in new money, causing more inflation pressure, which puts pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates, which discourages real-sector investment. </p>
<p>Which one should we encourage &#8212; borrowing or real investment? You decide. (And yes: we should also eradicate the insanely economically inefficient &#8212; and regressive &#8212; mortgage interest deduction, which makes the second scenario so much more attractive.) </p>
<p><strong>What about volatility? </strong>  The value of U.S. financial assets (nominal &#8212; not inflation-adjusted) fell by 13% from 2007 to 2009 (assets held by U.S. households, nonprofits, and nonfarm, nonfinancial businesses &#8212; Fed Flow of Funds TFAABSNNCB + TFAABSHNO). Under this proposal, that would result in a huge hole in the Federal budget. </p>
<p>Personal income went up by 2% (nominal) over that period (NIPA Table 2.1). This tells you: the revenues from a Financial Assets Tax would be much more volatile than from income taxes, because asset values are far more volatile than incomes. </p>
<p>But let&#8217;s step back: Every reasonable person (this excludes large portions of the Republican and Tea Parties) agrees that it&#8217;s smart for government to spend more in the bad times (causing a government deficit), and less in the good times (causing a surplus). It&#8217;s intuitively obvious (thanks to Keynes), we&#8217;ve seen it work (1939 <em>passim</em>), and all sorts of old and new economic theory, notably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_finance">Modern</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartalism">Monetary</a> <a href="http://e1.newcastle.edu.au/coffee/">Theory</a>, supports it in spades. </p>
<p>The problem, of course, is politicians. When bad times hit and government revenues are down, they panic like scared children. They don&#8217;t remember (or look forward to) the good times, like when the federal debt was plummeting during the Clinton boom/tax-increase/surplus years. So they do exactly the opposite of what common sense and prudent wisdom prescribe: they cut spending. The volatility of the Financial Asset Tax could contribute greatly to this panic-driven policymaking. </p>
<p>My only reply: it is to be hoped that the economic efficiency of the Financial Assets Tax &#8212; the growth and prosperity it engenders, especially in the real sector of the economy &#8212; would over the long term overwhelm the negative effects of political mismanagement. Other suggestions to overcome this difficulty, much appreciated. </p>
<p><strong>What about evasion and offshoring?</strong> Stocks of financial assets are easier to track and harder to hide than flows of income. They have to be stored somewhere. Since they&#8217;re not ongoing flows, they can&#8217;t be laundered and hidden as easily through multiple international pipelines and entities. People will still use secret accounts in the Bahamas to hide their money (as long as we allow the Bahamas bankers to get away with it; the Swiss can&#8217;t anymore&#8230;). And yes, people and businesses will figure out new schemes to evade this tax. People will always figure out ways to commit fraud. A simple tax on an easier-to-track item will make it harder for them to do so. </p>
<p>Since we&#8217;ll tax domestic entities&#8217; financial assets no matter what country those assets happen to be stored in (just as we tax worldwide income now &#8212; at least of natural humans) &#8212; people and businesses will have less incentive to keep piling up their treasure in financial (and real) assets overseas. They can bring it home at no cost (they&#8217;re paying taxes on it in either place) hopefully investing it in real assets here. </p>
<p><strong>Why not a consumption tax or VAT instead?</strong> I don&#8217;t actually know much about these, so take this for what you will. </p>
<p>Those taxes are good because they don&#8217;t penalize or kill incentives for work, innovation, and real earnings (personal earned income and real &#8212; nonfinancial &#8212; corporate profits). But both of them, as I understand the proposals and real-world examples I know of, tax investment spending at the same rate as consumption spending. So they&#8217;re not really just consumption taxes. They&#8217;re also investment taxes. That&#8217;s not good. I assume there are carve-outs to correct for that, but the more carve-outs you put in place for various and sundry reasons, the more messed up, gamed, and inefficient tax regimes become. The Financial Assets Tax makes things much more clear and simple. That&#8217;s one value of a flat tax. </p>
<p>Also: to make consumption taxes reasonably progressive, the top marginal rates have to be high, maybe even greater than 100%. Imagine a million-dollar consumer paying two million dollars in taxes on that consumption. You think <em>that&#8217;s</em> gonna happen? </p>
<p><strong>How do you phase it in?</strong> This would be a big change in the rules of the game. It&#8217;s both fair and efficient to give people time to adapt. I would do it based on: 1. person versus company, 2. age, and 3. quantity of financial assets. </p>
<p>For people: Give a few year&#8217;s warning, then in the first year, people 30 and under with more than $5 million in financial assets would be subject to the tax. (I am rather unconcerned with these people&#8217;s well-being, or with their ability to adapt to the new regime over the course of their lives.) Increase the age and reduce the cutoff &#8212; perhaps ending at around four to six times median income &#8212; over ten or fifteen years. Other personal tax rates should decline in concert. For companies: Give two or three years warning, then replace the tax on C-corp profits with the Financial Assets Tax. They&#8217;ll adapt just fine &#8212; mainly by shifting from financial investment to real investment, but also probably by increasing dividends, putting the money back out there where it can be intelligently allocated by the wisdom of the crowds rather than by CEOs&#8217; purported omniscience. Maybe this will also encourage corporations to hire CEOs who are real business managers, rather than practitioners of financial prestidigitation. </p>
<p><strong>Oh yeah: equity!</strong> Don&#8217;t change the channel, America. It matters. It especially matters to those who don&#8217;t have it. (Few of whom are reading this.) But excessive inequity hurts the rich too, in the long run, because it <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wealth-equality-and-prosperity.html">kills long-term national prosperity</a>. Economically efficient policies that deliver greater equity also deliver greater long-term prosperity. <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/congress-presidents-spending-taxes-debt-gdp.html">Even the rich get richer under progressive policies</a> (except maybe the very, very rich). The poor and the middle class get <em>far</em> richer.</p>
<p><strong>What do we mean by equity and inequity?</strong> Are we talking about income inequality? <em>Feh.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Figure 2. The actual United States wealth distribution plotted against the estimated and ideal distributions across all respondents.</strong> <em>Ariely and Norton, 2010 </em>(<a href="http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20ariely%20in%20press.pdf">PDF</a>)<em>.</em> 
<p>The bottom 80% gets about 40% of the income.</p>
<p>
<p>The bottom 80% owns about <em>15%</em> of the wealth.</p>
<p><strong>You want freedom? Look to your bank balance.</strong> You want opportunity? Look to your bank balance. You want time and space enough to innovate and be an entrepreneur, without the disincentive (not to mention embarrassment and inconvenience) of potential financial catastrophe? You want to buy birthday presents for your kids, get their teeth fixed, or put them through good colleges, maybe take a family vacation every year or two? You know where to look.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re not in the top 20%, you&#8217;re not looking at shit. <strong>So who pays the tax? </strong>You can see the ownership breakout for financial assets sliced various ways in the aforementioned Fed/Census Bureau table (<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/2009p/FEDs_appendix_tables_final.xls">XLS</a>). Here&#8217;s the breakout for <em>personal</em> holdings, by levels of income:</p>
<p><img title="Screen shot 2011-04-07 at 3.50.27 PM" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-07-at-3.50.27-PM-480x438.png" alt="" width="480" height="438"></p>
<p>This would be a very progressive tax, because the the distribution of wealth is very <em>re</em>gressive. It would compensate quite effectively for all our country&#8217;s regressive taxes, like payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, and cut-rate taxes on financial investments. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the wherewithal to calculate the total resulting progressivity. Perhaps it would be excessive, to the point of economic inefficiency (though I doubt it). <br />If we thought that was the case, we could reduce the rate from 1% to .75% or .5%, and continue income and other taxes at higher rates. Subject to discussion. </p>
<p>Bottom line: If we want widespread freedom, opportunity, innovation, entrepreneurship, and healthy, happy living, all feeding on itself in a virtuous, self-perpetuating cycle, then broadly based wealth distribution is at least one necessary condition. A tax on financial assets would be an (economically) efficient and effective means to move towards that goal. </p>
<p>Oh, and not that this matters, but in the short and medium term, while pies are growing and boats are rising, tens of millions of people get to suffer less. But maybe it does matter, because in the long run, you know&#8230;</p>

<p>This is an interview of Joseph Stiglitz on Democracy Now regarding his article in the current Vanity Fair.  He discuss the issue of income inequality, taxes, etc and how it has set us up to be less of a land of oportunity than what old Europe was.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>A few quotes: <br />
<blockquote>The question was, if people were getting rewards for contributing to our society, a theory that was in the 19th century called &#8220;marginal-productivity theory,&#8221; then you could say, &#8220;OK, those who contribute more should get more.&#8221; But what we saw in that crisis was that these titans of the financial industry got mega-bonuses while their companies were making mega-losses.</p>
<p>And with this one percent getting so much, there’s only one place really to get that extra revenue. The good news is it’s relatively easy. You have 25 percent—almost 25 percent of the income in the upper one percent, you raise their taxes by a few percentage points, and you get an awful lot of money.</p>
<p>This raises a very important point that I raise in my article, which is that much of the wealth of this one percent comes not from hard work, not from innovation, but from good investments in Washington, investing in political capital.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>This is new.  This post by Matthew Ygelsias isn&#8217;t about monetary policy, and I don&#8217;t find it convincing at all.  He <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2011/04/the-trouble-with-taxing-exclusively-the-rich/#">wrote</a></p>
<blockquote><p>if you raise high-end marginal rates while leaving deductions alone, what you do is massively increase the value of the deductions. The home mortgage interest tax deduction, for example, is both distributively regressive and also economically damaging by shunting too much money into the housing sector. If wealthy people start paying a marginal income tax rate of 47 percent, then the incentive to overconsume housing becomes much more intense. A economically sound approach to the tax code needs to go after some of these deductions, and that means some middle class families will have to pay somewhat more. </p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Yglesias almost contradicts himself when he notes that increased marginal tax rates on the rich increase the value of deductions *and* argues that to avoid that problem we must raise taxes on middle class people.  This isn&#8217;t true unless one assumes that the options open to legislators are limited (in particular that they don&#8217;t include something which might be called an &#8220;alternative minimum tax&#8221; like, say, the alternative minimum tax).  </p>
<p>One could replace the deductions by an AMT like provision that taxes are the greater of taxes calculated with the deductions and taxes calcuated without the deductions minus a credit equal to the reduction in taxes which would be caused by the deductions if family income were $250,000 (or individual income were 200,000 for individuall taxpayers).  I wouldn&#8217;t expect people to figure taxes owed under this code without turbotax, and couldn&#8217;t reprogram turbotax myself, but it would be no problem for someone more computer literate than I am.</p>
<p>Notice my proposal is complicated because I aim to raise taxes on zero non rich people.  I would prefer a reform which replaced deductions with tax credits.  This would increase tax liabilities of the upper middle class and reduce tax liabilities of the lower middle class and the poor.  </p>
<p>But it should be obvious that one doesn&#8217;t have to increase the benefits rich people get from deductions if one increases the marginal tax rates they pay.  He is  assuming that deductions can&#8217;t be replaced with a formula which is the same as the current formula (subtract deduction then go to the tax table) for income under 250,000 and quite different  for higher incomes (go to new tax table with adjusted gross income then subtract the integral of old marginal tax rates from adjusted gross income minus deductions  to adjusted gross income) .</p>
<p>Update:  <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2011/04/a-rigorous-progressive-budget/#">A friend explains to Matthew Yglesias that he was wrong.</a>  It is possible to reduce the value of deductions at will (as proposed by Obama from time to time by the way).  Therefore it is possible to soak the rich without increasing the incentives due to deductions.</p>
<p>Also, while on the topic of Yglesias and taxes, <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2011/04/the-income-tax-brought-to-you-by-world-war-ii/">I agree with him </a>that the right way to tax is a progressive consumption tax (I add that brackets have to depend on consumption per equivalent adult not on total family consumption).  So basically we agree about taxes (except I think I want them more progressive for tyranny of the majority class war reasons).</p>
<p>I do note that the graph he posted shows that the New Deal could be financed even though only about 20% of families filed income tax returns.  Notoriously, FDR didn&#8217;t like deficit spending (hence the 1937 recession).  The payroll tax was introduced.</p>

                                <blockquote><p>&#8220;The practice of medicine was accepted to be a chancy way to make a living, and nobody expected a doctor to get rich, least of all the doctors themselves.&#8221;  &#8211; Lewis Thomas, <em>The Youngest Science, </em>p. 4 (Penguin, 1995 edition, quote via Google Books) </p></blockquote>
<p>Lost in the discussion of Paul Ryan’s “plan” is the group of entrepreneurs that will be most harmed economically by enacting it: doctors—most especially general practitioners.</p>
<p>I was speaking with <a href="http://www.economicprincipals.com/" target="_blank">David Warsh</a> last week at Kauffman, and pointed out what “everyone knows” but no one will say: U.S. doctors net about twice as much money as doctors in the rest of the civilized world. (As a ballpark, $200K in the U.S. and $100K elsewhere.)  And until you can solve some of that, you won’t really make much of a dent in the High Cost of Medicine.  David noted that solving that “isn’t going to happen.”</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Paul Ryan’s plan is a large step toward making it happen—just not in the way David (or I) would have expected it to happen.</p>
<p>Let’s sidebar the usually Capitation v. Fee-for-Service discussion, which will only have an effect at the margin.  Assume that doctors net, say, $25 per patient (net of paying for office staff, supplies, waste disposal, etc.).[1]  If they schedule four patients per hour ($100)[2] for eight hours a day ($800) five days a week ($4,000) for a fifty-week year ($200,000), they make their salary.</p>
<p>Note the assumptions I made: the per-patient return is certainly variable (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost">standard MC/MR curve</a>), so the real return is based on volume and where that volume falls on the MC curve.  So long as a doctor can schedule to see 160 people a week—8,000 visits a year—they are continually busy and receive optimal returns.</p>
<p>But the market is not perfect.  I am of an age where a few visits a year is strongly suggested.  Tom or Rebecca, by contrast, go in once (if at all) and otherwise when they are unhealthy.[3]  It seems intuitive that, given search costs (think labor markets), a doctor’s practice is marginally more profitable with more repeat patients. Customer retention is therefore of enhanced value in the current equilibrium.[4]</p>
<p>But shifting the burden of payment while not capping insurance margins is also an easy first-order solution: fewer insured people, certainly; higher margins, probably (positive, maybe not significant), shifting of funds toward the sector that reduce overall consumption, and—inevitably—fewer doctor visits for the older and most likely to need care.</p>
<p>Note [4] above becomes relevant on the supply side; the relationship is weaker if still positive.  But the discretionary spending is reduced; Fee-for-Service fades except in the “concierge” segment of the market.  Capitation becomes the rule, and the model that has become prevalent—insurance companies guaranteeing doctors a salary—become the rule.</p>
<p>But visits to the doctor have declined, due to those most in need having the least ability to pay and therefore dropping off the insurance rolls.</p>
<p>So the insurance company doesn’t expect the doctor to make 8,000 separate treatments a year.  Or they do, but find at the end of the year that they were mistaken. The next year they offer to pay based not on 32 patients a day, but rather 30. And, given the frictions in the market, the majority of doctors agree, preferring the certainty of $187,500 a year to the risk of treating the uninsured, who are now a <em>much </em>riskier group.</p>
<p>And then the multiplier effect comes in.  Recall that there are fixed costs as well; doctors’s returns mirror the standard MC/MR curve.  So the actual loss begins gradually, but becomes steeper as the years go by—convexity effects appear.</p>
<p>Eventually, doctors have to right-size their practice. The current trend toward Vertical Integration may mitigate effects in the short term. But eventually—probably within 15 years, though it may take 20—doctors will find that their salaries (“net capitation fees”) are significantly closer to those of their European and Canadian peers.</p>
<p>Coincident to its effect on the poor and the elderly, Paul Ryan’s plan will speed the convergence of doctors’s salaries in the world.  The aspiring doctor in the Harvard Class of 2037 may well look at Lewis Thomas’s thoughts of one hundred years previous and say, “Nothing ever changes.”</p>
<p>The question that remains today is “What will we tell the doctors?”</p>
<p>[1]When I looked a few years ago, my doctor was paid $41 for my $125 office visit from insurance, and I had a $15 copay.  If you can’t figure out how $56 gross can become $25 net, go into a heavy-service industry, such as restaurants or doctoring, and look at their cash flows.</p>
<p>[2]Note that there is no inherent need to conform to the schedule, assuming the patients are not time-constrained.  That is, one can spend longer with patients—more than eight hours in a day—and maintain quality of care at the expense of leisure time.  This is a fairly simple equation and is left for when this isn’t a blog post.</p>
<p>[3]Again, the equation to show when the marginally-unhealthy choose to visit the doctor is left as an exercise. All we need for blog post purposes is to know that the choice is dependent on several factors, including disposable income and out-of-pocket cost.</p>
<p>[4]This is in no small part, at the margin, due to the support of the current Medicare/Medicaid system.</p>
<p>[5]Contracts still require both parties to consent, and the 6.6% decline is the net result—one might assume that some insurance companies will reduce their margins to pay doctors more.  One might also assume a pony with a pointy thing sticking out of its forehead with equal likelihood. There may well be a chimera of hope—though the scenario only extends the timeframe instead of ending the process—but it will not be sustainable, though it may be iterative (which would further attenuate the process).</p>

                                <p>More on the health-care later, but let me be clear:</p>
<p><strong><em>Congressman Paul Ryan&#8217;s &#8220;plan&#8221; is</em></strong> <strong>NOT</strong> <em><strong>a budget</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Budgets show Sources and Uses.  As <a href="http://cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12128">the CBO analysis</a> makes clear, this &#8220;budget&#8221; is no more a budget than Ryan&#8217;s last round of fakery.  To wit:<br />
<blockquote>The path for revenues as a percentage of GDP was specified by Chairman Ryan’s staff. The path rises steadily from about 15 percent of GDP in 2010 to 19 percent in 2028 and remains at that level thereafter. <em>There were no specifications of particular revenue provisions that would generate that path.</em> (CBO, page 11; emphasis mine)</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the equivalent of my current household budget, which is heavily dependent upon winning the lottery sometime in the next three years even though there is no provision for buying tickets.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll call Ryan&#8217;s proposal a budget when—as, for instance, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/winning-the-future">Obama&#8217;s does</a>—he specifies Sources as well as Uses.  Until then:<br />

</p>
<p>And, with due respects to <a href="http://boatagainstthecurrent.blogspot.com/2011/02/quote-of-day-elton-john-with-tough-love.html">the alcoholic lout</a>, sometimes a fantasy is <em>not</em> all you need.</p>

                                <p>Much is being made of the reported gains in same store sales by major retailers.</p>
<p>But it may be best to take these reports with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Until late last year price increases in the retail sector were minimal<br />and the reported retail sales increases reflected real gains.</p>
<p>Through year end the Y/Y deflator for retail sales rose less than 1%.</p>
<p>But late last year price increases accelerated sharply</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0ctdVjZ12lk/TZ3LADKaHZI/AAAAAAAABl4/eNF4IYl26HQ/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0ctdVjZ12lk/TZ3LADKaHZI/AAAAAAAABl4/eNF4IYl26HQ/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />In the fourth quarter the retail deflator rose at a 5.5% annual rate and in January and<br />February it rose at about an 8% rate.  The March data has not been reported yet,<br />but until new information is reported it probably would be best to assume the January<br />and February experience was repeated.</p>
<p>Also note that in March auto sales actually fell from 13.4 to 13.1 million(SAAR) &#8212;<br />a 2.2% drop.</p>
<p>In January the deflator for GAFO&#8211; department store type goods &#8212; sales rose at a 4.45%<br />annual rate, the largest jump in over a decade.  No wonder Wal Mart is warning about higher inflation.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>

<p>Anyone who watches the Supreme Court closely surely recognizes that Justice Kennedy last year took a hard-right turn, effectively removing himself from the role of swing voter and siding nearly always with the Court’s four-member rightwing bloc in ideologically determined cases. This term, he’s nailing any loose ends left over from last year in order to kill, kill, kill that annoying perception that his vote may be in play on ideological issues. The coffin holding the dead body of Kennedy-as-swing-vote is nailed and lies six feet under. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />So the question is why. And pardon me for thinking it has less to do with the specifics of the cases last term and this one than it does with the virulent ongoing criticism of the opinion he wrote last year for the five-member majority in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the infamous opinion that held that corporations are people, too, for First Amendment speech-protection purposes, and since campaign contributions are, in Supreme Court land, speech, legislative attempts to regulate corporate campaign contributions are unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Citizens United was decided on January 2, 2010 and was one of the earliest cases the Court decided in its 2009-2010 term. The Court’s term didn’t end until the last few days of June. </p>
<p>If I’m right that the reason Kennedy’s vote is no longer in play in cases in which political ideologically plays a role is that he’s reacting, whether consciously or subconsciously, to the criticism of Citizens United, we now have three justices whose votes in a large swath of cases the Court is asked to hear are decided largely or entirely by personal grudge. Thomas fairly openly operates based partly on bitterness about his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing (and slim-margin Senate vote), and Alito—inexplicably, in my view—has said he’s so bitter about his own confirmation hearing that he crosses the street rather than walk the Capitol on the same side of the street as the building. He now does something he apparently did not do as a longtime lower-court federal appellate judge: openly support far-right fund-raising efforts. Or at least he attended one such function.</p>
<p>So one-third of our Supreme Court appears to be using the Court as payback.   </p>

<p>I want to open a pizza place. I find an available space; a previous pizza place that went out of business. The only catch is that there are four other pizza places nearby, none of which is overcrowded, except at the peak of peak hours. </p>
<p>One&#8211;a block or two away, on another street&#8211;is the oldest and best: table service, other dishes, liquor license. The other three&#8211;two across the street, one up the block&#8211;all offer traditional and Sicilian slices and fountain and bottled sodas.</p>
<p>My store will offer regular and Sicilian slices, with fountain and bottled sodas.</p>
<p>When I use up all my capital and go out of business, is there any rational observer who would describe that as a &#8220;failure of the market&#8221;?</p>
