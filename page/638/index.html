                                <p>Mark Duggan and Fiona Scott Morton published <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w13917">a paper at NBER</a> with this general conclusion:<br />
<blockquote>Using data on product-specific prices and quantities sold in each year in the U.S., our findings indicate that Part D substantially lowered the average price and increased the total utilization of prescription drugs by Medicare recipients. Our results further suggest that the magnitude of these average effects varies across drugs as predicted by economic theory.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though they were only using one year&#8217;s worth of data—or perhaps because of it—they concluded that the program has been a success for the most common drugs. I posted this list at <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/04/rush-knows-his-audience.html">MU</a>, but it bears repeating here:<br />
<blockquote>Lipitor, Zocor, Prevacid, Nexium, Zoloft, Epogen, Celebrex, Zyprexa, Neurontin, Procrit, Effexor, Advair, Paxil, Norvasc, Pravachol, Plavix, Allegra, Wellbutrin, Oxycontin, Fosamax, Vioxx, Singulair, Protonix, Actos, Ortho, Aciphex</p></blockquote>
<p>Duggan and Scott Morton also found that—for the &#8220;small subset of &#8216;protected&#8217; therapeutic classes&#8221; that all providers were required to carry—the Part D prices to consumers actually <em>rose</em>. The authors explain this as a standard of economic theory:<br />
<blockquote>According to Part D regulations, there are six “protected” therapeutic classes in which PDPs must be less aggressive with their formularies than in other therapeutic areas. All products in the HIV, anti-cancer, anticonvulsant, immunosuppressant, antipsychotic, and antidepressant categories must be included in all Part D formularies. While a PDP cannot exclude any drug in these categories, it can create financial incentives or administrative hurdles to affect a patient’s choice of drug&#8230;.We do not know whether the restrictions applied to these classes have a measurable impact on the behavior of PDPs because in the first year of the program it was not clear how much CMS would oversee formularies. If restrictions are binding, their effect will be to reduce Part D’s effect on the substitutability among drugs (lower [gamma-sub-g]) and therefore reduce the PDP’s ability to extract manufacturer discounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>English version: without being able to threaten to exclude a drug from coverage, and not being certain about whether they would be permitted to classify a drug as more expensive than a counterpart under their specific plan, the drug companies could not bargain effectively with drug manufacturers.</p>
<p>Which makes perfect sense, until you consider that the price to Medicare recipients of those drugs went <em>up</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine the negotiations.  &#8220;You charge $1,000 for that drug.&#8221;  &#8220;Yes, but for you, $1,005.&#8221;  &#8220;Done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duggan and Scott Morton do present some caveats<br />
<blockquote>To the extent that plans become more or less successful at negotiating prices in future years, the results may of course change. Secondly, we are unable to measure any <em>ex post</em> rebates which PDPs may have been able to negotiate and which affect net prices to PDPs. Such rebates do not appear on the invoice, which is the source of IMS data, and might be causing prices to be even lower than those measured here. If rebates are present, our estimates are a lower bound to the price reductions achieved by PDPs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: Some PDPs may be making more money than we think at the current levels.<br />
<blockquote>The other rebates that we do not measure are Medicaid rebates paid by manufacturers to the Medicaid program. Dual eligibles’ pharmaceutical purchases under Medicaid automatically generated this rebate. Once dual eligibles move into Medicare Part D plans, their pharmaceutical purchases occur at different prices,  which is what we document here, but they no longer trigger automatic rebates. Any study of the total cost of Part D to the government would want to consider both sets of rebates.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: While the PDPs may have earned more, the government may have <em>spent</em> more (rebates not received).</p>
<p>The last two possible results would be similar to those expected by many economists who looked at the form of Part D, where the largest buyer (the Government) was prevented from using its buying power, but obligated to foot the bill for private companies that, individually and probably even collectively, would not be able to negotiate with the same influence.</p>
<p>More worrisome than that this conclusion should be expected is what might be expected to happen if the PDPs were rational.  Again, this would come from standard economic theory, though it is not discussed explicitly by Duggan and Scott Morton.</p>
<p>To be direct about it, the PDPs in Medicare Part D each has a steep learning curve, effectively creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switching_costs">switching cost</a> for the consumer.  That, in turn, will enable each PDP to retain its consumer base, <em>even while increasing the prices it charges</em>.</p>
<p>Health Economists especially are fond of talking about the &#8220;full cost&#8221; of something.  If it would take me twenty or thirty hours to select a replacement PDP, the that &#8220;cost&#8221; will keep me from switching, <em>even if I end up paying a few dollars more for a prescriptions</em>.</p>
<p>Contrast this with, say, automobile insurance.  The terms are all similar, and I can spend &#8220;15 minutes&#8221; getting a quote from GEICO (or three or four from Progressive) that I know is essentially the same coverage as my current provider.</p>
<p>I may not know how well the insurer will respond to me, and I may not know if they can provide the other policies I need (home, life, etc.), so there may be minor externalities (e.g., having to write different checks at different times to different insurers for different policies).  But there will be nothing on the order of the <em>switching costs</em> currently associated with Medicare Part D.</p>
<p>Duggan and Scott Morton have done a service in indicating that Part D has gotten more people using more drugs.*  And they have so far shown that economic theory appears to be holding in a real-life situation.</p>
<p>If economic theory continues to hold, we should expect that profit margins will grow over time, in reaction to the high switching costs that are built into the program.</p>
<p>We can hope that will not be so, but Mark Duggan and Fiona Scott Morton have not indicated that would be the way to bet.</p>
<p>*This is also the lesson of the Massachusetts universal health plan, but that&#8217;s for another post, though I note that the differing reactions to the two situations from some of the think tanks is interesting in itself.</p>

                                <p>In the last post and particularly in comments there was some discussion of Present Value more fancifully described as Infinite Future Horizon in relation to Social Security solvency. Which raised the question: Why should current workers care about the interests of retirees in year 2041 or indeed 2086? as opposed to say the interests of uninsured children in the here and now? Because in large parts these populations overlap, today&#8217;s 10 year old sick school kid will be 2055&#8217;s new retiree (assuming he survives the illness).  Given that under current assumptions he will be getting a better benefit in real terms than a similarly situated retiree today, why exactly is this particular policy matter elevated to the top of the agenda?</p>
<p>The key I think is to understand that advocates of Social Security privatization overlap with advocates of &#8216;tax cuts in all circumstances&#8217; which in turn overlaps with the Norquistian &#8216;drown it in the bathtub&#8217; people all of whom are starting from the ideological position &#8216;Big Government is not the Solution, Big Government is the Problem&#8217;. These folks simply don&#8217;t believe in Social Democratic solutions to anything, including Retirement Security. Never did, never will. I have to conclude that when someone tells me with a straight face that he is deeply concerned about retirement checks in 2086 but is simultaneously against funding SCHIPS because some insurance company might miss out on a premium dollar along the way that he is just trying to con me.</p>
<p>Movement Conservatives demonstrate every day that they simply don&#8217;t believe in social solutions to social problems, instead they will continually assert that all solutions should start with the individual in the marketplace. Well the problem for them is that society perceived in the case of Retirement Security and Health Care market failures. Social Security did not solve the entire Retirement Security problem nor did a combination of Medicare and Medicaid solve Health Care. But both were and are tremendously popular because they moved the ball forward on these issues. Much to the alarm of people who do not draw a line between Social Democracy and State Socialism, believing fundamentally with Hayek that one leads to the other right along the <a href="http://www.mises.org/books/TRTS/">Road to Serfdom</a>. Social Security Privatizers taken as a whole are just Movement Conservatives. They can protest all they like, they can try their best to appeal to liberal guilt about future generations, but in the end it is all about rolling back the New Deal.</p>
<p>Present Value calculations showing a $10 trillion dollar additional theoretical funding gap beyond 2086 are simply a gimmick to disguise the fact that these people have a whole different set of Present Values. Those calculations are a recent innovation simply designed to allow Movement Conservatives to undermine trust in the Crown Jewel of the New Deal, that is Social Security. They cannot afford to have Social Security be perceived as a success, that would just to them be another step towards Serfdom, who knows the next step might be Universal Single Payer Health Care. Unfortunately for them they may well be right, at least about the next step. The road to Single Payer runs right through Social Security solvency, they are right to be afraid.</p>

<blockquote>we develop computer simulation models to investigate such issues. Over the past couple of years we&#8217;ve worked with economists and farm leaders to model the corn economy. The insights are sobering. For the past several decades, despite changes in Congress, different presidents, and new farm bills, net income from farm sales of corn has hovered near zero. Some years are better, of course, but these tend to be the exception, caused by draughts or events like the Soviet grain deal of the 1970s.</p>
<p>Farm income is like the water flowing through a faucet into a bathtub. Some of the flow of income is from selling crops and livestock, and some comes from government support. The problem for farmers is that this bathtub has a big drain, and farm families only get to live on what stays in the tub. If money flows in really fast, as in an unusual year, the water stays high for a while, but it always drops down to the level of the drain.</p>
<p>The flow through the drain is determined primarily by the costs of land and technology required for farmers to stay competitive (as long as they&#8217;re on the commodity treadmill). Of all farm production expenses in 2000, 43% went to externally purchased crop inputs, 23% to livestock and feed expenses, and 23% to land related expenses and interest. Farmers have little choice but to pay these costs because of their weak bargaining position with landlords and large companies.</p>
<p>Since the inception of Freedom to Farm in 1996, $62 billion of its direct government payments have been used by farmers to pay higher land prices. Land values account for one-quarter to one-fifth of net cash farm income. Furthermore, $38 billion of the $62 billion increase in land values accrued to the balance sheets of non-farmer landlords.</p>
<p>Farm income doesn&#8217;t have to flow down the drain, pulling rural communities along with it. Instead of following the examples of the biggest farms with the most specialized production, we might want to learn from farms with rotations that reduce inputs, and we might look for markets that gain a higher proportion of consumer dollars. Instead of continually turning up the faucet, we might instead try to reduce the drain.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.usda.gov/documents/FARM_FAMILY_INCOME.doc">USDA</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>While larger farms comprise a relatively small proportion of farm households, they account for a large proportion of agricultural production (<strong>the 18 percent of farms with sales of $100,000 or more produce about 88 percent of total farm sales</strong>) and rely on farm profits for a higher percentage of household income than smaller farms. Over 80 percent of farm commodity program payments go to farming operations with sales of $100,000 or more. Government payments accounted for 5 to 8 percent of total gross cash farm income over the last several years. For larger farming operations that received Government payments in 2004, these payments dropped from roughly 10 percent of gross cash farm income for farming operations with $100,000 to $250,000 in sales to 5 percent of gross cash farm income for farming operations with over $500,000 in sales.</p>
<p>The well-being of farm households is not determined solely by the annual income of their members. Household wealth can play an important role in alleviating the impact of sudden changes in income, and most of the wealth of farm households is in the form of farm business assets, particularly farmland.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Former Republican Rep. Bob Barr launched a Libertarian Party presidential bid Monday, saying voters are hungry for an alternative to the status quo who would dramatically cut the federal government &#8230; If he wins the White House, he said he would immediately freeze discretionary spending in Washington. He also would begin withdrawing troops from Iraq and consider slashing spending at federal agencies such as the departments of education and commerce _ as well as at overseas military bases … &#8220;This notion that government owes something to people just because they&#8217;re here does not resonate with me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is not a charity.&#8221; Barr, 59, quit the Republican Party two years ago, saying he had grown disillusioned with its failure to shrink government and its willingness to scale back civil liberties in fighting terrorism. He has been particularly critical of President Bush over the war in Iraq and says the administration is ignoring constitutional protections on due process and privacy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Barr is a lot like Ron Paul on issues such as fiscal policy, civil liberties, and the Iraq fiasco.</p>

<p>Despite the importance of the CPI and all the discussion about it one of the things we do not have is data to compare the price of living in one city or state as compared to another.<br />Well the Federal statisticians are working on it and the BEA just published a working paper  by Bettina H Aten on Estimates of State and Metropolitan Price Levels for Consumption Goods and Services in the United States, 2005 http://www.bea.gov/papers/pdf/aten_estimates_state_metro_2005.pdf</p>
<p>The paper construction Spatial Price Indices (SPI) for the 50 states and Washington, D.C..<br />Moreover, in the index is also publishes a SPI for some 363 Metropolitan Statistical Areas.<br />Second it uses the SPIs to adjust estimates of real per capita personal income and real per capita GDP.</p>
<p>The results do not contain many great surprises, but it  nice to get reliable data comparing the cost of living and  to make realistic  comparisons of living standards across the country.</p>

<p>In Chicago the SPI is 107.1 and adjusted real per capita GDP is 109.2 while in Philadelphia they are 107.3 and 113,4, respectively. I’ve put a table comparing different cities under the fold.  The message that comes through is that the places in the country with high real per capita gdp and lowest  prices are the mid-sized, interior cities. Denver has an SPI of 95.5 and GDP of 139.6.  Other cities with good numbers are Indianapolis with an SPI of 93.5 and GDP of 136.9.; Nashville SPI=94.2 &#038; GDP=122.8. Minneapolis-St.Paul-Bloomington SPI=101.8 &#038; GDP=128.3.</p>
<p>But sometimes numbers can be misleading or distorted.  For example, Houston has an SPI of 98.5 and a GDP of 146.4.  But the high GDP reflects the impact of oil. In contrast, real per capita personal income in Houston is only 115.5.  Where I first noticed it was for New Orleans when it had a real GDP of 125.1 of the national average.  For the entire state of Louisiana it raised the GDP to 113.0 and making it the eleventh wealthiest state. But per capita income was only 84.1, the second lowest state –Hawaii was the lowest state with per capita income of 76.7.  Casper Wyoming had the highest GDP at 238.2 of the national average – how many oil wells do they have in Casper?</p>
<p>When you compare adjusted real per capita gdp by state there are several points that stand out.</p>
<p>First, the range is much narrower.  In both cases Delaware is the wealthiest state and Mississippi is the poorest state. In Delaware it does not make much difference as it is 161.5 before adjustment and 160.1 after. But it makes a big difference for Mississippi,  lifting it from 65.7 to 79.1. Before adjustment, Delaware is 2.5 times Mississippi but afterwards it is only two times.</p>
<p>The other big changes are for New York and California. New York falls from 107.7 to 80.2 while California falls from 119.3 to 89.3.  The study does not publish detailed data on rural areas or small towns, but it shows the real per capita income, real gdp and the SPI in these areas are around 80.  Because Los Angles and New York have below average GDP it does not offset the low living standards in the rural areas of the states.  But apparently rural New York has its own problems as one of the lowest GDP I spotted was Kingston,NY with a GDP = 53.7. The lowest was Lake Havasu City, Az at 48.5.</p>
<p>After adjustment a bloc of Midwestern states with relatively low population density are ranked very high. They are Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and Colorado.  I suspect a major factor here is that they do not have urban slums. Massachusetts falls<br />from 119.2 to 100.7 while Texas increases from 103.4 to 110.9. But otherwise, it is very hard to make broad generalizations about the impact of the SPI adjustments.</p>
<p>The Washington, D.C. real GDP data is significantly distorted by commuters.  The output of workers commuting into the city are counted in GDP but they are not included in the population.</p>

<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/stephen-moore-looks-at-mississippi.html">Cactus</a> has caught <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121037876256182167.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">Stephen Moore</a> lying to the readers of the Wall Street Journal again:</p>
<blockquote><p>For most of the past 30 years, Mississippi has ranked as one of the poorest as well as one of the most litigious states. The two statistics are related … Shortly after winning election in 2003 by running on a tort-reform platform, Mr. Barbour stitched together a coalition of doctors, business groups, taxpayers and even unions to roll back the trial lawyer lobby … Almost overnight, the flow of lawsuits began to dry up and businesses started to trickle in … About 60,000 new jobs have arrived in four years – not a small number in a workforce of about 1.3 million – and a sharp improvement from the 30,000 jobs lost in the four years before Mr. Barbour took office … Thanks to Mr. Barbour, the state&#8217;s unemployment rate is down to about 6% from nearly 9%. Last year, Mississippi&#8217;s per capita income growth was 6.7%, third highest of the 50 states and well above the national average of 5.2%. Mississippi tort reform is making the poor richer</p></blockquote>
<p>We have graphed both the state’s employment as well as its unemployment rate from January 1998 to March 2008 using <a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?la+28">this source</a>.  As far as the unemployment rate, we see a clear indication of a Katrina bounce, which has come and gone, but no evidence of any alleged litigation relief effect.  We also see a Katrina effect, which came during Barbour’s tenure and has shift dissipated.  Now it is true that during Bush’s first term in office, employment growth was negative in Mississippi but wasn’t it negative for most of the nation?  Once one graphs the employment series and thinks about the effects of Katrina and that recession a few years back – it is hard to see anything of a litigation relief effect at all.  </p>
<p>As far as the growth in per capita (nominal) income, Cactus would have us look at <a href="http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/spi/spi_newsrelease.htm">this source</a> which states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Louisiana grew 10.5 percent in 2007, down from 20.6 percent in 2006. These growth rates are substantially higher than any other state&#8217;s. The rental income component of Louisiana&#8217;s personal income was boosted in 2007 by $5.4 billion of Road Home subsidies from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The subsidies are to persons whose homes had been destroyed or damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Mississippi, whose Homeowners&#8217; Assistance Program was funded $1.5 billion by HUD, grew 7.4 percent in 2007 up from 6.0 percent in 2006.</p>
<p>Per capita income. U.S. per capita income grew 5.2 percent in 2007, down from 5.6 percent in 2006, but equal to the average of the last four years (2004-07). Louisiana&#8217;s per capita income was up 9.2 percent or $2,935. Much of the gain in Louisiana is accounted for by the Road Home subsidies which averaged nearly $1,250 per Louisiana resident. In Mississippi, housing subsidies added $530 to per capita income.</p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the state&#8217;s per capita income in 2007 was only $28,845 which ranks it 50 out of 50 again.  Could someone at the Wall Street Journal kindly suggest to Mr. Moore’s that such blatant abuse of the data to make a phony argument is not an appropriate thing for this business newspaper to do?</p>

                                <p>Tom&#8217;s working on explaining Savings 101, so this is specifically to deal with the &#8220;issue with&#8221; retirement accounts.</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://laglux.blogspot.com/2008/05/teeny-weeny-mistakes.html">Lawrence G. Lux</a>, we find the A.P. (and maybe the NYT) highlighting a &#8220;study&#8221; by an investment management firm that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/business/AP-Savings-Mistakes.html?pagewanted=print">&#8220;discovers&#8221; problems with the way people manage their 401(k)s</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Some of the diversification problems stemmed from concentrated holdings of company stock. Experts urge savers to hold no more than 10 percent to 15 percent of their accounts in company stock, pointing out that they could sustain significant losses if the company runs into trouble or goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>The Financial Engines study found that among savers eligible to receive company stock, more than one-third had more than 20 percent of their holdings in the company&#8217;s shares. Some older workers had more than half their holdings in company stock, and workers with salaries under $25,000 also held a disproportionate amount of company stock, the study found.</p>
<p>On the level of savings, the study found that just 7 percent of 401(k) participants were saving the maximum allowed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Much of that is common sense. (Think Enron: the time when your company stock will be least value to you also will be the time you may need to borrow against your retirement account.)</p>
<p>Some of it, likely, is the way the plans are offered. (Again, think Enron.) Public companies tend to offer their stock as part of a &#8220;retirement plan,&#8221; and many &#8220;investors&#8221; are told to invest in &#8220;what you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the absurd claim in the lede of the AP piece (&#8220;Despite extensive efforts to educate workers about saving for retirement&#8221;) is belied by two realities.  One is noted by Lux:<br />
<blockquote>Look, Maw, those damned Kids don’t know how to manage their (401)k Funds. When are they going to learn that they have to spend 20 hrs. per Week evaluating good potential Investments. Listen to them complain that they don’t have the time–between raising children and working a 50-hour Workweek. (italics removed)</p></blockquote>
<p>the other comes from anyone who knows a bit of history and remembers that pensions have been historically underfunded (or raided) by management.  If trained money managers couldn&#8217;t do a good job in the Glory Days of Defined Benefit (and, make no mistake, a literal reading of economic theory would lead anyone to believe those were the glory days), then expecting people who do <em>not</em> specialize in managing money to allocate &#8220;appropriately&#8221; should be, on the face of it, absurd.</p>
<p>Finally, some of the problem likely is due to constraint optimization issues. (Short version: You can only save what you don&#8217;t have to spend.) Let us rewrite this paragraph:<br />
<blockquote>Nearly two-thirds of those earning less than $25,000 a year don&#8217;t contribute enough to get the full company match, the study found. But 24 percent of those earning $50,000 to $75,000 a year and 12 percent of those earning more than $100,000 a year didn&#8217;t get the full match, either.</p></blockquote>
<p>as<br />
<blockquote>Only slgihtly more than one-third of those earning less than $25,000 a year have enough disposable income to get the full company match, the study found. Meanwhile, 76 percent of those earning $50,000 to $75,000 a year and 88 percent of those earning more than $100,000 a year were able to qualify for the full match.</p></blockquote>
<p>But that makes it clear, as divorced one like Bush noted in <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/8373322695349287248/#697629">a comment to vtcodger&#8217;s post</a>:<br />
<blockquote>You don&#8217;t invest in the market until you have money you can afford to lose.</p></blockquote>
<p>And a lot more people making $50,000-plus-a-year have money they can afford to lose than those making less than $25,000 p.a.  Which is what the data shows.</p>

<p>This second one is just plain funny (at least to me).  It spoofs on the Annie Oakley comment by Senator Obama.</p>
<p>On the economy side of things using my GFP (gross flower production), things were not as good as last year.  What started off as a year with a bang, is now looking to be equal to last years numbers.  We were up 21% end of March.  End of April we were up 4.7%. As of Mother&#8217;s Day, 2.6% on the year.  Interestingly, looking at credit card use for the holiday months Valentines was up 23%, Easter was up 13% and now Mother&#8217;s Day is down 27%.  This is the shift I saw starting last August.  But, cash sales are up for May 33%.  They were up for January and February, but cash sales were down both March and April.</p>
