<p>Social Security&#8230;Hearts and Minds</p>
<p>   Tom Margenau wrote an essay about the payroll tax holiday in The National Memo <a href="http://nationalmemo.com/content/your-tax-holiday-gift-lump-coal" target="_blank">Is Your Tax Holiday Gift A Lump of Coal?</a>  His essay seemed to me to illustrate one of the problems with the Social Security &#8220;debate&#8221; as it has been constructed.</p>
<p>Margenau  describes himself as &#8220;not very good with numbers,&#8221; but someone who has been accused of being &#8220;a bleeding heart liberal.&#8221;  &#8220;But,&#8221; he says, &#8220;this is one liberal who gives the Republicans credit&#8230; at least they are willing to talk about it.&#8221;   The trouble with all this is that Margenau does not understand the numbers, so he is giving the Republicans credit for being willing to talk about a problem that does not exist.</p>
<p>This is exactly what &#8220;liberals&#8221; have been doing:  searching, searching for a way to ease their bleeding hearts by solving the huge, terrible problem that only looks huge when you don&#8217;t understand the numbers.</p>
<p>Margenau cites the famous &#8220;in less than 20 years there will be only two workers supporting each retiree.&#8221; And he proposes &#8220;relatively modest changes&#8230; bumping up the retirement age..&#8221;</p>
<p>You may read his full essay at the place cited.  Easiest for me to simply reprint here the reply I sent to him. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Tom,  Your heart is in the right place, but you miss the critical point.  Social Security is not welfare.  It is critically important that it   is not welfare.  FDR understood this so he made it &#8220;worker paid&#8221;   insurance, &#8220;so no damn pollitician can take it away from them.&#8221;  Social Security was never in trouble. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> All that 3 to 1 and 2 to 1   worker to retiree ratio is lying nonsense meant to impose on people   whose math skills are not very good.  What it amounts to is that if people are going to live longer&#8230;  say   20 years after working 40 years, instead of 13 years after   working 40 years, they will need to save about one third more each   month for their own retirement.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> This means raising the payroll tax   from 6% to about 8%.  And since the change in life expectancy is not   going to happen all at once, it means we can raise the payroll tax   one half of one tenth of one percent each year. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> This is an increase of 40 cents per week for the average worker   today.  And while the increase gets bigger over time, so do wages. So   the increase will never be felt as more of a burden than that 40   cents per week.  AND the workers will get the money back, with   interest, so they can look forward to a longer retirement with better   benefits than today&#8217;s retirees. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> The Republicans were not being more responsible&#8230; they were telling   a Big Lie.  They could get away with it because the average person is   innumerate, and the average liberal no longer understands the   important difference between Social Security and welfare.  It is probably too late, but it would help if the people who think SS   is important at least understood the facts and the basic principle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Margenau replied to me that &#8220;the worker to beneficiary ratio is not lying nonsense.  It is critically important.&#8221;  And indeed it is.  It is fundamental.  But it doesn&#8217;t mean what he thinks it means.  All it means is that if we are going to live longer we are going to have to save more for our retirement. The &#8220;more&#8221; is not burdensome.</p>
<p>But working an extra year could be hell for many people.   Meanwhile, Our President, and his Friends Across the Aisle have killed Social Security.  They did it by the breathtakingly bold and easy step of just taking away its funding by calling for a &#8220;payroll tax holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Democrats &#8230;Democrats!&#8230; are now running on the issue of making the payroll tax holiday permanent &#8220;to avoid a huge tax increase on the middle class.&#8221;  The lying is sickening.  But the people will go for it.  And the Republicans will cry,  &#8220;Oh no, not the briar patch!  Don&#8217;t throw me in dat briar patch Br&#8217;er Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>And laugh up their sleeves while the &#8220;progressives&#8221; think they have scored a huge win for the poor.   And the poor will never understand what happened until they go to retire and learn they&#8217;ve had another year added on to their sentence, or have to go to the welfare office to prove they need &#8220;benefits,&#8221;  and they better bring a note from their doctor saying they only have one more year to live.</p>
<p>The only way out of this would be a sudden demand by a hundred million working people to &#8220;raise our taxes!  give us back our Social Security!&#8221;</p>

                                                                            <a href="./../category/steve-roth/index.html" class="post-category-41" title="Steve Roth"><div class="color-box"></div>Steve Roth</a>                                                                     </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Let&#8217;s start with two basic facts:</p>
<div>• Governments in all thriving, prosperous countries tax/spend 25–50% of those countries&#8217; GDP (averaging around 40%).</div>
<div></div>
<div>• Governments in non-prosperous countries &#8212; those that haven&#8217;t suffered a recent crash in the numerator/GDP &#8212; are all below that range.</div>
<div></div>
<p>There is not a single thriving, prosperous country that does not tax at these levels, or engage in massive quantities of redistribution. Not one.</p>
<p>For me, this raises the conundrum:</p>
<div>If policies eschewing such redistribution are so economically efficient &#8212; as claimed by libertarians/conservatives/Republicans/neoclassical economists &#8212; one would expect at least one country to have emerged that eschews those policies, and to see that country surge ahead of all the rest.</div>
<div></div>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t happened. Not once.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s easy to jump to the <em>post hoc ergo propter hoc </em>conclusion:</p>
<div>Redistribution is necessary for a prosperous country to emerge and thrive. It is at least a necessary (though of course not necessarily sufficient) <em>cause</em> of that prosperity.</div>
<div></div>
<p>But of course you can argue the opposite causation:</p>
<div>Prosperity causes bigger government.</div>
<div></div>
<p>I see two possibilities there:<br /><a name="more"></a>
<div></div>
<div>1. Government services are &#8220;normal goods&#8221; &#8212; as people get more prosperous, they want more of them. Giving people what they want is not a bad thing.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2. The growth of government is an emergent property of a prosperous economy, and is not actually an expression of, does not provide, what individuals want. It just happens because of the inherent dynamics of the system. (Dynamics that are easy to imagine but that I won&#8217;t describe here.)</div>
<p>#2 is, I think, the the argument that libertarians would make to explain the correlation between government size and prosperity.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to adjudicate in any definitive way between these two conclusions, or between [one of them] and the redistribution-&#8220;causes&#8221;-prosperity conclusion.</p>
<p>Given some correlation (necessary to even assert causation), the only way to convincingly demonstrate causation is to tell a coherent and convincing story about the process by which the causation happens. That&#8217;s what I did in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/12/nine-reasons-that-progressive-policies.html">my first Angry Bear post</a> (well, you can judge for yourself how convincing it is).</p>
<p>Absent any definitive way to decide, for the time being I&#8217;m going to stick with the first-blush conclusion suggested by the correlation, and supported by my theories of causation:</p>
<div>Larger government and a significant dose of redistribution are necessary for a prosperous, modern country to emerge and thrive.</div>
<div></div>

<p>Foreign-owned US insurance companies frequently reinsure through their foreign affiliates and then claim a deduction under section 832(b)(4)(A) for the reinsurance premium paid to the affiliate to reduce the US tax liability of the US company.</p>
<p>Rep. Richard Neal (D-Ma) introduced a bill on October 12 that has been referred to the House Ways &#038; Means Committee, where it now languishes unattended by the Republican chair, David Camp of Michigan.  <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3157:">H.R. 3157</a> amends the Internal Revenue Code to create a new section 849, which disallows the deduction for certain reinsurance premiums and related amounts paid to non-taxed foreign affiliates, defined as members of a controlled group, with 50% rather than the usual 80% used to define a control relationship. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The President&#8217;s FY 2012 Budget included a similar proposal for disallowing some affiliated reinsurance premium amounts.  Earlier iterations of a disallowance bill were introduced in 2000 and 2001.  A bill with somewhat broader disallowance provisions, H.R. 3424, was introduced by Representative Neal in 2010 and did receive a hearing at Ways &#038; Means that year.  <!-- more --> The Joint Committee on Taxation issued a report on reinsurance with offshore affiliates prior to the hearings on H.R. 3424 in 2010, titled &#8220;Present Law And Analysis Relating To The Tax Treatment Of Reinsurance Transactions Between Affiliated Entities&#8221;, <a href="http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&#038;id=3690">JCX-35-10</a> (including a description of HR 3424 and the President&#8217;s FY 2012 proposal, beginning at page 22).  As noted in the JCT report:</p>
<blockquote><p>When these assets are shifted from a U.S. insurer to an offshore reinsurer with a foreign parent, these earnings may no longer be subject to U.S. income taxation. If the U.S. insurer and the offshore reinsurer are affiliated, the profits attributable to the reinsured risks remain within the affiliated group, although the earnings on the assets may no longer be subject to U.S.income taxation. (footnotes deleted)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the offshore affiliate is in a low or no-tax jurisdiction, the result may be almost no tax  on the reinsurance premium amounts (other than the applicable excise tax, if not eliminated by treaty).  Not surprisingly, the trend over the last few decades has been towards reinsurance arrangements with affiliates:  between 2001 and 2008, ceding of insurance of offshore affiliates grew by more than 108%, while ceding of insurance to nonaffiliated offshore entities grew by only 16%.  See JCT report at 11, n.21 and accompanying text.  Bermuda, a jurisdiction with no corporate tax and one especially friendly to insurers, is the most frequent jurisdiction for these affiliated reinsurance transactions.  The JCT report notes that the lack of a market price for affiliate transactions provides an incentive to shift income between affiliates at off-market prices.</p>
<p>Also not surprisingly, lobbyists for these foreign-owned insurance companies have fiercely fought the possibility that this handy tax-reduction technique might be legislated away.  The &#8220;Coalition for Competitive Insurance Rates&#8221; put out a press release on November 29, praising Republican lawmakers from Florida who had joined in a letter, available <a href="http://abir.createsend4.com/t/y/i/ydlyjhd/l/t/">here</a>, opposing the bill. The claim is that eliminating the tax avoidance technique will be a &#8220;punitive tax on reinsurance&#8221; that would &#8220;lead to higher premium costs&#8221; because it would &#8220;impose a tariff on international reinsurance firms&#8221;  and that this would amount to &#8220;punitive and anti-competitive taxes.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Florida Republican representatives note that 90% of Florida&#8217;s insurance is reinsured offshore.  The fact that such affiliate reinsurance is widespread does not mean that it is a better means of risk management.  The regular amount of US taxes that would be charged on those US affiliates&#8221; income is not a &#8220;punitive&#8221; tax: it is merely the amount of tax that those firms would pay if they do not use affiliates as reinsurers. </p>
<p>Note that moving the insurance to an affiliate doesn&#8217;t achieve the risk-shifting that reinsurance is designed to accomplish&#8211;it retains the risk within the controlled group.  (The IRS litigated a number of captive insurance cases under the theory that a controlled group constitutes a single economic &#8220;family&#8221; and hence cannot achieve risk-shift or risk-diversification.  Although courts were hesitant to adopt this theory, it does seem to capture the essence of the affiliate reinsurance problem.  The JCT report noted above also suggests the theory as a means of addressing the tax avoidance technique.)  Although lobbyists claim that reinsurance with affiliates is a valuable &#8220;risk-management&#8221; tool and that reinsurance with affiliates accomplishes the same risk management as reinsurance with non-affiliated parties, it seems that reinsurance within a controlled group does not provide the same risk protection as nonaffiliated reinsurance.   A catastrophic event covered by the reinsurer could result in liquidation of its assets, including its interest in the US affiliate.</p>
<p>Insurers using offshore affiliate reinsurers claim that there are nonetheless real non-tax advantages: (i) reducing adverse selection/moral hazard from information asymetry between insurer and reinsurer and (ii) &#8220;allowing risk and capital to be moved more easily &#8230; to respond to changing market conditions.&#8221;  See Cragg, Cummins &#038; Zhou, The Impact of a U.S. Tax on Offshore Reinsurance Market, The<a href="http://www.brattle.com/_documents/uploadlibrary/upload863.pdf">Brattle Group</a> , May 1, 2009 (research funded by the Coalition for Competitive Insurance Rates projecting a 2.1 &#8211; 2.4% rise in insurance costs upon elimination of the affiliate reinsurance scheme) (also cited in the JCT report for these claims). </p>
<p>These so-called advantages of affiliate reinsurance appear spurious.  First, while the interests of the insurer and its affiliated reinsurer are aligned (so that the insurer will have less incentive to select the worse policies for that affiliated reinsurer or to be lax in its policy making for policies it will reinsure with its affiliate), the absence of real risk-shifting would make that alignment of little real value.  Alternatively, as the JCT report notes, the aligning of interests may mean that the premium paid to affiliated reinsurers should be <em>lower</em> than the third-party premium, meaning that much of the affiliated reinsurance market may result in understatement of the US company&#8217;s income. Furthermore, nonaffiliated reinsurers may well undertake more comprehensive due diligence connected with taking on real reinsurance risk, and thus in fact contribute to a better risk-balanced insurance market.  </p>
<p>Second, the claim that reinsuring with offshore affiliates allows for easier movement of capital in response to market conditions is of little real benefit to the U.S. insurance market.  The foreign parent that reinsures the U.S. affiliate has received an advantage from having that reinsurance premium as its capital while at the same time reducing its US affiliate&#8217;s tax liability, but that merely substantiates the complaint of domestic companies that the ability to reinsure with a foreign affiliate gives an unjust  competitive advantage&#8211;the double whammy of the tax deduction to the US affiliate and the capital infusion to the foreign company.  Further, as we saw in the 2008 financial crisis,  globalization of interactions among financial companies can have deeply negative systemic effects. </p>
<p>On balance, eliminating the deduction for affiliate reinsurance premiums is not the creation of an &#8220;anti-competitive tax&#8221; whenthe insurer is using the affiliate to shift income offshore and avoid paying U.S. corporate taxes.   In fact, the ability of some insurance companies to offshore preimums is itself anti-competitive, since it puts wholly domestic U.S. insurance companies at a disadvantage.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In my first post here as an official Bear, I want to start by thanking Dan Crawford and the rest of the Clan of the Angry Bear for inviting me to join the party. I&#8217;ve been a regular lurker and occasional commenter for years, and have learned a huge amount from the experts here. I&#8217;m looking forward to contributing more regularly.</p>
<p>For my inaugural post, I&#8217;m going to break with my tradition and rather than inflicting data on you, I&#8217;m instead going to frame much of what I write in some big-picture ideology and theory.</p>
<p>I think this thinking does much to explain what Mike Kimel in particular has made so clear here over many years (with occasional help from <em>moi</em>): that based on the long-term historical record, by pretty much any economic measure it&#8217;s <em>progressive</em> policies that deliver superior growth, prosperity, fiscal responsibility, opportunity, individual liberty, and a vibrant, robust economy and society.</p>
<p><strong>How can that be?</strong> Aren&#8217;t Republicans &#8220;the party of growth&#8221;?</p>
<p>That question cuts straight to the reason I started blogging back in 2004. Back then I generally and rather unthinkingly accepted (at least provisionally) the dominant meme of Reaganomics &#8212; that larger government hurts economic growth. But I&#8217;ve always been a curious fellow (yes, in both senses&#8230;), so I started pulling data and crunching it to see for myself. (I am from Missouri, after all.)</p>
<p>I was pretty astounded at the time to find that the dominant meme just wasn&#8217;t true. Run the numbers various ways yourself, or do a review of the <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/small-government-spurs-growth-economists-say-no.html">professional</a> <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/an-open-letter-to-robert-barro.html">literature</a>, and you get the same results: <strong>in prosperous countries, government size has basically no correlation with long-term economic growth</strong> (even though government sizes vary <em>hugely</em> &#8212; from well under 30% of GDP up to 50%+). Go figger.</p>
<p>And that means that all the rhetoric, ideology, and theory supporting that meme has a problem. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that it was in fact wrong by a 180 degrees.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how I came to what I&#8217;m giving you here &#8212; a reprise, revision, and reworking of thinking I <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-party-of-prosperity-the-seven-reasons-that-democrats-policies-are-more-economically-efficient.html">wrote up</a> a couple of years ago:<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><strong>Alternate Title: </strong><br /><em><strong>The Nine Habits of Highly Efficient Economies</strong></em></p>
<p>Republican economic policies are widely perceived (especially by Republicans) as being pro-growth and pro-prosperity, even though <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&#038;hl=en&#038;rlz=1B7GGLL_enUS365US365&#038;q=site%3Awww.angrybearblog.com+cactus+democrat+republican&#038;aq=f&#038;aqi=&#038;aql=&#038;oq=">All</a>. <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/democrats-are-profligate-spendthrifts-oh-wait.html">The</a>. <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/pro-growth-republicans-get-real.html">Evidence</a>. <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/pro-growth-republicans-revisited.html">Demonstrates</a>. <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/where-did-the-deficit-come-from-conservatives-of-course.html">The</a>. <a href="http://www.blogger.com/pro-growth-republicans-debunked-again-some-more.html">Opposite</a>. <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-26-at-6.45.50-AM-433x500.png">Even the rich get richer under Democrats</a> (except for the very rich) &#8212; though not at the expense of the poor and the middle class.</p>

<p>How do they achieve all that? Through the miracles of economic efficiency &#8212; policies that make the markets actually work &#8212; and work better &#8212; for the greater prosperity of all.</p>
<div><strong>Wisdom of the Crowds.</strong> Democrats&#8217; dispersed government spending &#8212; education, health care, infrastructure, and social support &#8212; puts money (hence power) in the hands of individuals, instead of delivering concentrated streams to big entities like finance, defense, and business. Those individuals&#8217; free choices on where to spend the money allocate resources where they&#8217;re needed &#8212; to truly productive industries that deliver goods people actually want.</div>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>Preventing Government &#8220;Capture.&#8221; </strong>Money that goes to millions of individuals is much less subject to &#8220;capture&#8221; by powerful players, so it is much less likely to be used to then &#8220;capture&#8221; government via political donations, sweetheart deals, and crony capitalism. Those bogeyman &#8220;welfare queens&#8221; don&#8217;t have much power or presence on K Street. The Wall Street and Defense Welfare Queens quite decidedly, do.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Economic Stability. </strong>The social support programs put in place during and since the New Deal serve as automatic stabilizers for the economy, providing the kind of anticyclical fiscal policy that legislators and monetary authorities cannot &#8212; in their infinite discretion &#8212; be relied upon to deliver. Just as volatility trashes the returns on your investment portfolio, wild swings in the economy trash collective prosperity and the spectacular potential of compounding growth.</div>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>Labor Market Flexibility. </strong>When people feel confident that they and their families won&#8217;t end up on the streets &#8212; they know that their children will have health care, education, a measure of economic security, and a decent safety net if the worst happens &#8212; they feel free to move to a different job that better fits their talents &#8212; better allocating labor resources. &#8220;Labor market flexibility&#8221; often suggests the freedom (of employers) to hire and fire, but the freedom of hundreds of millions of employees is far more profound, economically.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Freedom to Innovate. </strong>Individuals who are standing on the social springboard that Democratic policies provide &#8212; who have that stable platform beneath them &#8212; have the economic freedom and security to strike out on their own and develop the kind of innovative, entrepreneurial ventures that are the true engine of long-term growth and prosperity (and personal freedom and satisfaction) &#8212; without worrying that their children will suffer terribly if the risk goes wrong. Give twenty, forty, or a hundred million more Americans a place to stand, and they&#8217;ll move the world.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Profitable Investments in Long-Term Growth. </strong>From education to infrastructure to scientific research, Democratic priorities deliver money to projects that the private market don&#8217;t support on their own, and that have been demonstrated to pay off many times over in widespread public prosperity.</p>
</div>
<div><strong><strong>Labor and Trade Efficiencies.</strong> </strong>The social support programs that Democrats champion &#8212; if they truly provide an adequate level of support &#8212; give policy makers much more freedom to put in place what are otherwise draconian, but efficient, trade and labor policies. If everyone who works is guaranteed a decent income by a program like the Earned Income Tax Credit, we have less need for the economically constricting effects often associated with unions and protectionism.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Power to the Producers. </strong>The dispersal of income and wealth under Democratic policies provides the widespread demand (read: sales) that producers need to succeed, to expand, and to take risks on innovative new endeavors. (There aren&#8217;t many rich people, so they can&#8217;t buy very many iPads.) Rather than assuming that government knows best and giving money directly to businesses and banks, Democratic policies trust the markets &#8212; the people &#8212; to direct that money to the most productive producers.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Fiscal Prudence. </strong><em>True conservatives pay their bills.</em> From the 35 years of declining debt/GDP after World War II (until 1982) to the years of declining debt under Bill Clinton, to the flattening of the debt runup that&#8217;s projected under Obama (after the historic spike that Reaganomics and Bushonomics has delivered), Democratic policies demonstrate which party deserves the name &#8220;fiscal conservatives.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div>These aren&#8217;t actually &#8220;the&#8221; nine reasons &#8212; there are many more (I haven&#8217;t even mentioned smart, sensible regulation) &#8212; but they&#8217;re a great starting point for the kind of thinking that needs to be repeated over and over, endlessly, for decades (a la the Republicans&#8217; incredibly effective long-term brainwashing campaign following the Powell memo), to bring about the change our country needs to thrive in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Progressives are the party of prosperity, of individual opportunity, and of economic freedom. The historical and comparative evidence shows it in spades, and there&#8217;s very coherent and convincing theory to explain why. That&#8217;s a lot of what I&#8217;ll be talking about here at the Bear. I&#8217;m excited to hear your thoughts.</p></div>

                                <p>Health Care thoughts: PPACA Employer Mandate Part 1</p>
<p>So I am trying to put together a template for evaluating the employer  health insurance mandate under PPACA&#8230;.</p>
<p>Some preliminary thoughts:</p>
<p>50 employees does not mean 50 employees, there as a Full Time Equivalent (FTE) calculation that is certain to confuse employers because it is different than any other FTE calculation we have ever seen.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />In the process of avoiding penalties employers need to obtain information about household income and number of persons in the household, but obtaining the information could be difficult and verifying the information could be impossible. Asking for the information before hiring could be illegal (opinions vary so far). Monitoring changes will be very difficult. And how will the government gather and update this information?</p>
<p>Smaller employers say 40 to 200 head count (or FTE) without sophisticated HR resources are going to be really confused.</p>
<p>This is gonna be interesting. Any thoughts from the Bears?</p>

<p>From an e-mail from guest contributor Michael Halasy:</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t necessarily know either. My research (Operations Research with a Workforce focus) is modeling many of these changes (stochastic, variable, simulation, etc.). I think Tom&#8217;s point is correct in that this will get interesting. We need better modeling data to determine this. A good friend is a senior fellow at Lewin, and I know he is doing a lot of this modeling now (impact of ACA on companies, physician practices)&#8230;..I think it&#8217;s simply too early right now&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/12/gops-unemployment-compensation-and-payroll-tax-cut-up-for-vote-on-tuesday.html">GOP&#8217;s payroll tax cut bill (with a lot of other stuff) up for vote on Tuesday</a>
<p>[edited 2 pm 12/13 to provide additional links to news coverage of some of the changes]</p>
<p>Congress has been playing politics as usual over the few policies that are on the table that have a real chance of assisting, to some degree, the plight of ordinary Americans and perhaps even the slow recovery that is still trying to gain steam&#8211;extension of the reduction in payroll taxes (from 6.2% to 4.2%) and extension of unemployment compensation.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The Republicans have refused to pay for these common sense tax reductions for ordinary Americans with a similarly common sense tax increase on the wealthiest Americans who have continued to capture all the productivity gains in the economyt.  Republicans in the House think that these kinds of provisions should be offset by more goodies for the &#8220;uberclass&#8221;&#8211;at least as evidenced by the <a href="http://rules.house.gov/Media/file/PDF_112_1/legislativetext/HR_1209.pdf">H.R. 3630</a>, the bill introduced by Dave Camp (R-MI) and to be voted on today at about 4:30 pm. </p>
<ul>
<li>It would restructure unemployment compensation in ways that add hurdles and make it less likely that unemployed Americans will qualify&#8211;providing more state flexibility and experimentation (including paying employers to cover part of cost of wages exceeding the recipient&#8217;s prior benefit level), permitting demeaning drug testing of all unemployment compensation recipients (section 2127), and requiring a high school diploma or participation in state &#8220;reemployment services&#8221; for which recipients may be charged up to $5 weekly out of their unemployment compensation.  It would severely curtail the total number of weeks for which federal unemployment assistance is available&#8211;moving to a 59-week limit from a 99-week limit.  Methinks I see Scrooge here&#8230;.. </li>
<li>It will interfere with the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s ability to regulate, letting corporations continue to harm the environment at the expense of ordinary Americans.   See Subtitle B.  Section 1102(b) lists rules that are &#8220;stayed&#8221; by the legislation and provides that no new rules can have an effective date earlier than 5 years out and requires consideration of various factors in determining that date.  Further, it requires adoption of the laxer 2000 definitions for certain key terms and the imposition of the &#8220;least burdensome&#8221; among potential regulatory alternatives.  This is a key cave-in to corporate polluters.  </li>
<li>It will expedite the KeystoneXL pipeline by requiring a permit to be issued within 60 days unless within that time the President determines that the pipeline will not serve the national interest (in which case within 15 days the President must provide various committees and members of Congress a report justifying that conclusion from various perspectives).  It indicates that the environmental impact statement from August will be treated as satisfactory for environmental and historical preservation purposes and shall not have to be supplemented if there are modifications to the plan  and no further federal environmental review shall be allowed.  This is a clearly ideologically driven provision, failing to give due regard to the potential longterm environmental impact on drinking water aquifers or historical preservation impact.  </li>
<li>It would provide yet another tax reduction for US corporations that have paid less and less taxes over the last decade, with a renewal of the ill-advised 100% expensing provision in section 168(k)(5) (along with the alternative of accelerating AMT credits) </li>
<li>it makes further changes to medicare such as applying a cap to hospital outpatient therapy services and reversing part of the Health Reform Act passed earlier, by permitting new doctor-owned hospitals and permitting existing ones to expand, even though it has been shown that such hospitals spend more on testing and procedures (and profit more from them).  See, e.g., Pear, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/health/policy/republican-tax-and-unemployment-bill-would-help-hospitals-owned-by-doctors.html">G.O.P. Bill Would Benefit Doctor Owned Hospitals</a>, New York Times at A24, Dec. 13, 2011. </li>
<li>it would continue funding for the &#8220;healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood&#8221; initiative, see <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_42_00000603----000-.html">42 U.S.C. section 603(a)(2)</a>  (the cynic in me suspects that these funds primarily go to programs supported by religious institutions and that they proselytize more than they teach reasonable relationship skills) </li>
<li>it includes an extensive section remaking flood insurance provisions, including, in section 3005, lifting the cap for premium increases for flood insurance from 10% to 20% (an apparent boon to insurers), and another section prohibiting the administration from &#8220;disregarding&#8221; any levee or floodwall, even if it is not accredited.  <strong>The goal, made clear in section 3009, is privatization of the national flood insurance program</strong>. </li>
<li>It includes extensive broadband spectrum auction provisions in Title IV, Subtitle A, reallocating spectrum from federal to nonfederal use.  These provisions, among many detailed ones, e.g., <strong>permit private administrators of state public safety networks to use the public spectrum for private purposes as well as the public safety  purpose</strong>and prevent states from denying requests for modifications of existing wireless towers that do not substantially change the physical dimensions thereof. </li>
<li>It increases the guarantee fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. </li>
<li>It requires a social security number for the refundable child credit</li>
<li>It provides in section 5895 a 100% tax on &#8220;excess unemployment benefits&#8221; that go to millionaires (unemployment compensation is reduced proportionately as the adjusted gross income increases from $750,000 to $1 million)&#8211;The Times today has an article on the bill and notes that the number of millionaires receiving unemployment compensation is very small, but that their participation is predicated on the fact that the unemployment compensation program is a type of insurance into which payments are made to cover payouts.  <strong>Means testing such insurance programs is in sync with the right-wing goal of means-testing as a prelude to privatizing and/or eliminating all federally administered social welfare insurance programs, such as medicare and Social Security (and, see above, national flood insurance).</strong></li>
<li>It increases pension contributions from longterm federal workers by .5% a year for 2012-2014 and for those &#8220;secure annuity employees&#8221; with less than five years of service, by more than 10% a year and using 5 year average pay rather than 3 year average pay, sets annuity amounts, and ends the annuity supplement for post-2012 retirees. </li>
<li>it extends the general freeze on federal pay for another year</li>
<li>It increases the premiums for Medicare Part B and Part D for those making $80,000 or more (for those making $200,000 or more, the applicable percentage is 90%)&#8211;this again appears to move these national social welfare insurance programs towards more means-testing that will facilitate privatization or eventual elimination.  </li>
<li><strong>It sets up a number of procedural hurdles in the Senate, which is already hogtied by the ease with which a minority of its members can filibuster and thus stop legislation that is supported by a solid majority of its members.  For examples,</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>it requires a 2/3 vote in the Senate to amend the dates for section 601(c) of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr4853enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr4853enr.pdf">2010 Tax Relief Act</a>&#8211;that&#8217;s the temporary employee payroll tax cut;</strong></li>
<li><strong>it provides that a point of order by any Senator against an emergency designation in a bill eliminates that designation and makes it impossible to bring the designation through a floor amendment unless there is a supermajority 3/5 vote in favor of doing so (limiting debate to 1 hour)&#8211;thus one right-wing Senator intent on obstructionism can make it very unlikely that an important provision can pass by preventing even reasonable debate about the importance of the provision!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The GOP, of course, touts its bill as creating jobs.   While the Keystone pipeline may create some short-term jobs (the New YorkTimes reports estimates from Transcanada itself  and the State Department of only about 6500 temporary construction jobs  and maybe 50 permanent new jobs&#8211;see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/opinion/keystone-claptrap.html">Keystone Claptrap</a>, Editorial, New York Times at A34, Dec. 13, 2011), the potential negative impact on aquifers could be life-threatening.  Most of the other provisions are Scrooge-like additions of hurdles and caps on social welfare provisions or attempts to roll back the social welfare insurance provisions into means-tested ones that will be even more susceptible to the derogatory and inflamatory class-action warfare that the right has increasingly unleashed on anything that doesn&#8217;t give a break to the wealthy and corporate clients of the all-powerful Washington lobbies. </p>
<p>On lobbies, just read the New York Times article about the wealth that online educators are getting from state and federal taxpayer dollars for delivering no or sub-standard education, and the amount of taxpayer money being spent on lobbying to ensure the continuous flow of that wealth.  See Saul, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/education/online-schools-score-better-on-wall-street-than-in-classrooms.html">Profits and Problems at Online Charter Schools</a>, New York Times, Dec. 12, 2011.  It&#8217;s obvious that the corporatist agenda sees no problem with siphoning off taxpayer dollars for private benefit with little public good created, but complains mightily about any siphoning off of exorbitant corporate profits&#8211;that tend to go to wasteful excess managerial compensation or portfolio enhancement&#8211;for taxes intended for public benefit.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the Keystone and other right-wing-rhetoric-driven items in a bill to provide the payroll tax cut and a limited unemployment extension (with hurdles) demonstrates the absurd level of ideological partisanship engaged in by the House Republicans.  Senate Majority Leader Reid characterized the bill as loaded with &#8220;ideological candy&#8221; that the Senate would reject.  Sloan &#038; Rubin, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/12/13/bloomberg_articlesLW5T8C6K50Z4.DTL">House to Vote on Payroll Bill as senate Eyes Tax Sweeteners</a>, Bloomberg.com (Dec. 13, 2011).    Of course, most of the sweeteners that Reid proposes adding are components of the right-wing corporate-friendly agenda&#8211;like the R&#038;D credit that rewards what companies do anyway; the active financing exception for big banks, insurers and other financial institutions that lets them defer taxation on their financing income earned overseas; and accelerated depreciation for restaurants and motorsports tracks that provide special tax subsidies to particular industries!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last month, I published a post on the nonsense that is Black Friday sales (<a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/11/no-black-friday-sales-were-not-up-16-not-even-6/">No, Black Friday Sales Were Not Up 16% (not even 6%</a>). That evolved into a Washington Post article, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/did-black-friday-save-the-season-beware-the-retail-hype/2011/11/29/gIQAfNCUMO_story.html"><em>Did Black Friday save the season? Beware the retail hype</em></a>.</p>
<p>Today, we learn that many breathless forecasts from NRF to ShopperTrak were so much <strong>hot air </strong>and <strong>empty hype</strong>: Sales were flat to up only modestly. Total U.S. retail sales in November gained only 0.2%, following a 0.6% October. Even that month was revised downwards.</p>
<p><em>Retailers themselves may pay the price for their massive discounting</em>: Not only might their quarterly earnings be affected by the margin pressure, but they continually train investors shoppers to hunt for discounts. Retail therapy and sport shopping are being replaced by extreme couponing and sites like Living Social and Groupon.</p>
<p>…</p>

<p>U.S. retail sales rise slightly in November (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-retail-sales-rise-slightly-in-november-2011-12-13">Marketwatch</a>)</p>
