                                <p>Maggie Mahar has been has been showcased at Angry Bear in prior years, mainly in regards to healthcare, but has written on many topics with an economic theme.  I am happy to announce she has agreed to write for Angry Bear, so please welcome her when her first post or two appears.  Of course, readers, I am sure you will provide ample comment in the Angry Bear tradition.  The following is a quick bio:</p>
<p>Maggie Mahar is the author of Money-Driven Medicine: The Real Reason Health Care Costs So Much (Harper/Collins 2006) and Bull! A History of the Boom, 1982–1999 (Harper/Collins, 2003), a book that Warren Buffett recommended in Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s annual report.</p>
<p>She also narrated <a target="_blank" href="http://www.moneydrivenmedicine.org/">Money-Driven Medicine</a>, a  film based on her book, produced by Alex Gibney (best known for Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room ) and directed by Andy Fredericks. <br />Bill Moyers called  it &#8220;one of the strongest documentaries I have seen in years.&#8221; </p>
<p>From 2007 to  2011, she wrote the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/www.healthbeatblog.org">HealthBeatBlog</a>, focusing on the economics and politics of heatlh care reform. The blog drew a loyal following made up of  medical professionals, health policy experts,  patient advocates., and others willing to take a skeptical look at our health care system.   </p>
<p>Before beginning to specialize in health care, Mahar was a financial journalist. From the late eighties through the late nineties, she worte cover stories for Barron&#8217;s.. There, she covered  both Wall Street and  Washington, investigating and profiling corporate America while also writing about financial markets in the U.,S and abroad, with an emphasis on Japan and Russia.. After leaving Barron&#8217;s, she wrote a column about international markets and economics for Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Before becoming a journalist,Mahar was an English professor at Yale University.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2011/12/johnston-income-inequality.html">Taxprofblog</a> comes David Cay Johnston&#8217;s <em>Income Inequality Increases as Bank Regulation, Prosecutions Decrease</em> through Reuters, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/2011/12/04/the-taxpayers-burden/">The Taxpayers’ Burden</a>, by <a href="http://www.perfectlylegalthebook.com/author.htm">David Cay Johnston</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The accompanying graphic shows a fascinating correlation. In the years before New Deal regulation of banks and after the easing of regulations began in 1980, bank failures were quite high. So was income inequality.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/files/2011/12/US_BNKFAIL1211_SC.jpg"><img title="US_BNKFAIL1211_SC" alt="" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/files/2011/12/US_BNKFAIL1211_SC.jpg" width="500" height="350"></a></p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>But from about 1933, when the federal regulation of banks was put in place, to 1980, when Chicago School theories began to shape policy, bank failures were rare. During those years incomes were much more equal, with a prosperous middle class. &#8230;</p>
<p>Correlation is not causality, but the fact that income inequality rose as banking regulations were eased makes sense. Freed of restraints, banks got into all sorts of activities that generated fees and saddled clients with high-interest debt. And once banks could collect fees for mortgages without having to worry about repayment — because the mortgages were sold off by Wall Street — the crucial link between reward and responsibility was severed.</p>
<p>With loosened financial regulation it would seem smart to increase law enforcement. Instead, enforcement was cut, as the chart from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse shows. Based on Justice Department internal reports, it shows criminal prosecutions involving financial firms down sharply since fiscal 1999.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/files/2011/12/US_BNKPROSECUTE1211_SC.jpg"><img title="US_BNKPROSECUTE1211_SC" alt="" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/files/2011/12/US_BNKPROSECUTE1211_SC.jpg" width="500" height="350"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>These findings about bank failures, income inequality and lack of prosecutions all take us back to the coordinated attempt by the central banks of the United States, Britain, Canada, the European Union, Japan and Switzerland to delay the day of reckoning on European debt. &#8230; Given the revolving doors that allow the financial class to move smoothly between government, central banks and financial firms throughout the modern world, and how those in power in all of these places have invested their reputations in Chicago School theories, my educated guess is that taxpayers will be stuck with the costs. Let’s hope I am wrong.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Numbers Behind Newt&#8217;s Plan to Balance the Budget</p>
<p>Newt Gingrich&#8217;s website provides information on <a href="http://www.newt.org/solutions/jobs-economy">The Gingrich Jobs and Prosperity Plan</a>.  It starts with this:  </p>
<blockquote><p>America only works when Americans are working. Newt has a pro-growth strategy similar to the proven policies used when he was Speaker to balance the budget, pay down the debt, and create jobs. </p></blockquote>
<p>Excellent.  That statement should be enough to get an idea of what the program will look like.  I want to focus on the first piece:  balancing the budget. (You can&#8217;t pay down the debt unless you run a surplus, so balancing the budget also deals with that issue.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the surplus / GDP looks like for the years from 1988 to 2004.  The gray bar covers the years from 1995 (the Republican Revolution took office, and Newt Gingrich became speaker in 1995) to 1998 (Gingrich resigned as speaker in November 1998.)</p>
<p>(Incidentally &#8211; the surplus is simply Total Federal Receipts less Total Federal Expenditures, which come from lines 37 and 40 of the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=9&#038;step=1">National Income and Product Accounts Table 3.2</a>.  GDP comes also comes from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">BEA</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nVPk_K2elno/Ttwok_cI9LI/AAAAAAAAAxw/F18FsfQFySY/s1600/Newt_Figure_1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nVPk_K2elno/Ttwok_cI9LI/AAAAAAAAAxw/F18FsfQFySY/s320/Newt_Figure_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>

<p>As you can see, the deficit did indeed turn into a surplus when Gingrich was in office.  However, the chart makes it clear the trend began before Newt took office and continued after Newt left office.  In fact, it seems that the deficit started falling in 1993.  The surplus, on the other hand, peaked in the year 2000, fell, and the budget returned to a deficit.  So what defined the years from 1993-2000?  Oh yeah, they were the years Clinton was President.  So Newt is basically saying he would support the policies that produced success in the Clinton years.  </p>
<p>That is wonderful&#8230; those were years of great prosperity.  You have to go back to the JFK &#038; LBJ years to find presidents who oversaw faster growth rates in real GDP.  But let&#8217;s stay focused on the deficit and surplus issue.  In fact, let&#8217;s deconstruct the number into its constituent parts.   Figure 2 shows Total Federal Receipts / GDP and Total Federal Expenditures / GDP.  </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_c3tYqZvztE/Ttwok0P3RZI/AAAAAAAAAx8/dd7clNlTomc/s1600/Newt_Figure_2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_c3tYqZvztE/Ttwok0P3RZI/AAAAAAAAAx8/dd7clNlTomc/s320/Newt_Figure_2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>As is evident from Figure 2, Total Federal Receipts / GDP hit a low point in 1992 and started to rise in 1993, eventually peaking in the year 2000 and then falling.  Total Federal Expenditures / GDP hit a high point in 1992, then began falling in 1993, eventually hitting a local nadir in 2000 and then starting to rise again.  The trend during the Newt Gingrich years looks like the rest of Clinton years&#8230; well, except for a slight slowing in the rate at which expenditures were dropping.  </p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking that Newt&#8217;s comments about deficit reduction speak more to his views on expenditures than on taxes.  After all, few Republicans talk about increasing the tax burden these days and it would take a lot of guts for Newt to break with his party on this one.  But looking once more at the numbers its obvious Newt really does want Americans to pay more.  </p>
<p>Consider&#8230;  in 1995, Gingrich&#8217;s first year as speaker, federal expenditures were 22% of GDP.In 1998, they were 20% of GDP.  But&#8230;  revenues in 1995 were 19.2% of GDP.  That is to say, had revenues remained at the 1995 level, they would have been less than expenditures and the budget would have still been deficit Newt&#8217;s last year in office (and in fact, in 1999 as well).  But Newt takes credit for balancing the budget.  </p>
<p>Thus&#8230;  by necessity he is taking credit for raising the tax burden on the American people.   Granted, there were no hikes in the marginal rate while he was speaker, but the increase in the tax burden came about with increased enforcement and regulation.  This is a  man with political courage!  This is a man who puts doing the right thing above any thoughts of personal gain! </p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;d like to put the tax hikes that Newt seems to be advocating in context.  For this, I&#8217;m going to steal a graph from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Facts-Presidents-Measure-Issues/dp/B005HKSK8M/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0">Presimetrics</a>, the book I coauthored with Michael Kanell.  In it, we used a slightly different version of the tax burden:  instead of Federal Revenues / GDP, we looked at the percentage of people&#8217;s income that went to taxes.   We looked at the annualized rate of change of this version of the tax burden for each Congressional administration from 1952 to 2008.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we found:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E20x9DhypGc/TtwollW_ImI/AAAAAAAAAyI/U7x0mQ5Y-HA/s1600/Newt_Figure_3.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E20x9DhypGc/TtwollW_ImI/AAAAAAAAAyI/U7x0mQ5Y-HA/s320/Newt_Figure_3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3.</p>
<p>As Figure 3 shows, the Republican Revolution (which granted, extended a few years beyond Newt) oversaw the largest (by far!!!) annualized increase in the tax burden of any Congress in several decades!  Because taxes aren&#8217;t that popular with Republicans these days, Newt is downplaying the issue, but he seems to be dogwhistling it for those of with some familiarity with the numbers.  The only alternatives are that he is ignorant of the numbers, or that he is will to obfuscate the facts, but hopefully we can expect more than that from someone running for the highest office in the land.</p>

<blockquote><p>What caused the housing bubble?</p>
<p>This is a different, though related, question from what caused the collapse of the financial sector or why unemployment is sky-high right now. Why did housing value skyrocket and then collapse? More broadly, why did all kinds of consumer debt expand so greatly over the past decade?<br />&#8230;<br />there’s another argument, which looks at the explosion of international lending and the indebtedness of the United States by foreign investors. Normally capital runs from rich countries to poor countries, but something changed where it reversed as capital went rushing to the United States. This exposed the United States to the same kind of risks developing nations usually face. And the new book Lost Decades by Menzie D. Chinn and Jeffry A. Frieden, economists at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and Harvard, is the best book-length treatment of this argument.</p></blockquote>
<p>(italics mine)<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2011/11/solving_america_1.html">Menzie Chin</a> writes about Lost Decades at Econbrowser:</p>
<p>&#8230;Jeffry Frieden and I conclude in our book, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~mchinn/lostdecades.html">Lost Decades</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>America’s prosperity requires fiscal responsibility. The phrase “fiscal responsibility” has been used so much that it is something between an obligatory buzzword and a code word for cutting government spending. In our view, true fiscal responsibility involves a willingness to raise sufficient tax revenue, over the longer term, to pay for the programs the government implements. Fiscal responsibility should not be equated with a small government, but rather with a commitment to pay for the government services provided. If the nation affirms that enhancing national defense and improving health care for the poor are legitimate goals, fiscal responsibility entails raising the revenue to fund these programs, rather than borrowing for them.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Cost of Education Is Crushing the Opportunity We Mean It to Provide</p>
<p>The Occupy Wall Street movement has no formal goals but several consistent memes have emerged among the crowd demonstrations in various cities across the country. Most of these have to do with the concentration of wealth and the collusion/corruption between big business and government. However, a more selfish trend also has surfaced among the demonstrators – many want their college student loans forgiven.  </p>
<p>A small, informal survey among New York protestors last week by equity research analyst David Maris found ninety-three percent of them advocated student-loan clemency. This idea actually is neither original to OWS nor unique among its members.</p>

<p>New York University Professor Andrew Ross recently proposed a radical solution to student loan debts the he calls “A Pledge of Refusal.” The idea requires those who owe to sign a pledge to stop making payments on their student loans once the pledge garners a million signatures. Meanwhile, an online petition supporting student loan forgiveness has collected over a half million signatures.   </p>
<p>President Obama announced a plan last week to provide student loan relief. First, he is reducing the maximum repayment on student loans from fifteen percent of discretionary annual income to ten percent. Second, he will allow borrowers to combine loans from the Family Education Loan Program with direct government loans, with a lower consolidated interest rate. Obama plans to use his Executive authority to bypass Congress for this program.   </p>
<p>Democratic Representative Hansen Clarke of Michigan wants to go even further. He has introduced legislation (H.R. 365) that includes creating incentives for banks to negotiate with distressed lenders, providing tax credits for education expenses and student loan debt, and making more private student loans eligible for discharge in bankruptcy proceedings.   <br />Both Obama’s and Clarke’s solutions fall short of general clemency but protestors are unlikely to obtain this remedy. A Rasmussen poll found only twenty-one percent of American adults in favor of blanket forgiveness as contrasted to sixty-six percent opposed. Many feel clemency would be unfair to lenders as well as those borrowers who repaid their student loans. At worst, they write off OWS protestors and other advocates for loan forgiveness as spoiled, lazy slackers who expect a free ride.   </p>
<p>Such epithets are unfair, counters conservative columnist Nicholas Kristoff this week in the <i>New York Times</i>. “While alarmists seem to think that the movement is a ‘mob’ trying to overthrow capitalism, one can make a case that, on the contrary, it highlights the need to restore basic capitalist principles like accountability.” Kristoff goes on to deplore how “some financiers have chosen to live in a government-backed featherbed. Their platform seems to be socialism for tycoons and capitalism for the rest of us . . . they can privatize profits while socializing risk.”   <br />Representative Clarke concurs that most protestors “are not asking for [a bailout]. They are simply asking for a system that is not rigged against them.” When big bankers and investment firms can make poor decisions without suffering obvious consequences, then the motivation for individuals requesting similar absolution may not be admirable but it is understandable.   <br />While the current crop of students and recent graduates may be whining about the problem more than past generations, they face an objectively bigger problem. This year, the average borrower graduating from a four-year college left school with roughly $24,000 of student debt, with ten percent facing debt of $40,000 or more, according to the College Board. Total student loan debt will exceed $1 trillion this year and it now exceeds outstanding credit card debt, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.   </p>
<p>Only seven percent of graduating bachelor’s degree holders come from the bottom quarter of income earners, as compared to twelve percent back in 1970. Intended as relief and opportunity for the distressed poor, student loans have become an unavoidable middle class reality. In addition, a series of laws passed by Congress last decade have increased the difficulty of discharging debt, including student loans, through bankruptcy.   <br />The website <i>College Scholarships</i> reports on several programs that forgive or reduce student loan debt for graduates willing to work in high need/disadvantaged areas. The problem is such programs are limited to highly targeted professions, such as nurses, attorneys, and teachers. What is more, they often require a minimum of five years experience. Traditionally, graduates take such jobs immediately after graduation to acquire experience, when they are most inclined to social activism and less acclimated in their lifestyles to larger salaries.   </p>
<p>I attended college for six years, ultimately earning a master’s level degree in 1984. I won several scholarships, based on merit; qualified for several grants, based on need; and I worked. In spite of this, I fell short of the necessary money for tuition and books on a couple of occasions. I took out a couple of federal student loans to make up the difference that I was able to repay within a few years of graduation.   </p>
<p>Contrast my experience with that of Robert Applebaum, who graduated from Fordham Law School in 1998 with about $65,000 in debt. After going to work as an Assistant District Attorney in Brooklyn, his salary forced him to put his student loans in “forbearance,” which prevents default but allows continued accrual of interest. Applebaum began repaying his loans upon leaving the DA’s office in 2004 but remains $88,000 in debt today.   <br />Tommaso Boggia is an MPA candidate at Presidio Graduate School and an advocate for student loan clemency. He writes at the website <i>Triple Pundit</i>, “Regardless of work ethic, more and more middle class families are slipping into poverty, in part because of the heavy debt burden of house ownership and of pursuing a higher education degree . . . A whole generation is seeing their plans and ambitions shackled by the extra weight of their student loan payments. These young people are unable to buy a home, start a family, or do the socially important but underpaid jobs in the social services sector.”   </p>
<p>In the post-World War II era, a college education was the chief means by which children from working poor families could leapfrog into the middle class or even affluence. Increasingly, however, the cost of this requirement is becoming the very thing holding them back from the opportunities promised by the American Dream.  </p>
<p>The most cited reason for exploding debt is the ever-increasing cost of college. Average in-state tuition and fees at four-year public colleges rose an additional eight point three percent in 2001 alone, passing $8,000/year ($17,000/year with room and board). In addition, the American Council on Education notes that budget cuts and other austerity measures have reduced state appropriations to higher education by eighteen percent over the last three years.   </p>
<p>Richard Vedder, Director of the Center for College Affordability and Productivity and author of the book <i>Going Broke by Degree – Why College Costs Too Much</i>, maintains that we are looking at the problem exactly backwards. Writing in the <i>National Review</i>, he argues that just as an abundance of easily obtainable, low interest mortgages spurred the housing bubble that caused the 2008 financial crisis, “Arguably, federal student financial assistance is creating a second bubble in higher education.”   </p>
<p>Vedder also points out that government doles out loans without discrimination to a student’s prospects of success in college, despite the fact that over forty percent of those pursuing a bachelor’s degree fail to receive one within six years, or chances of success after college, regardless of whether a student’s field of study offers poor versus good job/career availability. During a 2011 <i>PBS NewsHour</i> appearance, Vedder argued American society must “open up opportunities for people to consider a variety of different options after high school, one of which is college, but there are many others.”  </p>
<p>Most of us may not agree with those advocating total clemency for student loan debt. While this solution may be overly simplistic and impractical, it seems clear that some reforms are necessary – whether the efficiencies proposed by Obama, the incentives proposed by Clarke, or Vedder’s more draconian measures toward higher education in general. It also means we need to give OWS protestors and other loan forgiveness advocates more credit for identifying a real, substantive, and systemic problem beyond their selfish interests.  </p>
<p>If we value an education for our children as much as we claim, our society has to find a way to re-engineer it back from the crushing burden it has become to more of the opportunity we aspire it to be. Right now, the main thing we are teaching our kids is learning to owe. This is neither opportunity nor American exceptionalism. </p>

                                <p>Newt Gingrich tells the truth.</p>
<p><a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/updates/2385">“the individual mandate was originally developed by the Heritage Foundation and others, as a way to block Hillarycare.&#8221; </a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Firebagger&#038;defid=4972615">Firebaggers</a> argue that the PPACA is conservative, because it is similar to a Heritage Foundation proposal.  They neglect to note that the proposal was made in bad faith.  The point was to complicate the debate by making it Clintoncare vs Obamacare vs no reform.  That way the result was no reform, even though most US adults wanted some reform.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>This is not speculation.  The Heritage/Romney/Obama approach was also the Chafee proposal.  [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chafee">John</a>] Chafee (R-R.I.) proposed something like the PPACA in 1993.  Senate minority leader R. Dole cosponsored the bill. In 1994 Dole voted against a bill whcih he had cosponsored proving that his advocacy of an individual mandate was made in bad faith and aiming only at complicating the debate.</p>
<p>Similarly when Ted Kennedy was advocating single payer/Medicare for all, Nixon proposed a reform similar to that proposed by the Clintons.</p>
<p>Yes Obama, all Democratic Senators, two independent Senators, and a majority in the House voted for a plan similar to one proposed by The Heritage Foundation.  Everyone who works at The Heritage Foundation (except maybe a janitor who hates the jerks after whom he cleans up) recognized this as a huge defeat.  Jane Hamsher hasn&#8217;t wised up.</p>

<blockquote>Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley is suing five major US banks for allegedly seizing properties unlawfully and failing to help struggling borrowers keep their homes by lowering mortgage payments.</p>
<p>The civil lawsuit — filed yesterday in Suffolk Superior Court — targets Bank of America Corp.,Wells Fargo &#038; Co., JPMorgan Chase &#038; Co., Citigroup Inc., and GMAC, a subsidiary of Ally Financial Inc. Also named are Mortgage Electronic Registration System Inc., a widely used mortgagerecording firm, and its parent company.</p>
<p>‘‘Our suit alleges that the banks have charted a destructive path by cutting corners and rushingto foreclose on homeowners without following the rule of law,’’ said Coakley, citing whatshe called their illegal behavior.</p>
<p>It is the first major legal action taken against the nation’s biggest banks since they startedforeclosure-settlement negotiations with the 50 state attorneys general in the spring. The talksbegan after the attorneys general launched an investigation into reports of fraudulent and sloppy foreclosure-related practices by the banks.</p></blockquote>
