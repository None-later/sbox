                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The WSJ reports on an Obama administration plan to convert US Treasury owned preferred shares to common stock.  The plan seems to be an answer to the question &#8220;How does one save an insolvent bank without giving a windfall to current shareholders or nationalizing ? &#8220;</p>
<blockquote><p>The government will convert its stake only to the extent that Citigroup can persuade private investors such as sovereign wealth funds do so as well, the people said. The Treasury will match private investors&#8217; conversions dollar-for-dollar up to $25 billion.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>The conversion will come at the most-favored price, meaning the government will get the best price of the private shares that are converted. Citigroup has already begun talking with preferred shareholders about the conversion, people familiar with the matter said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah yes that&#8217;s it.  Seems that smart people work for the US Treasury (OK I know that already).</p>
<p>Under the plan, current common stock will be diluted so much that it is basically worth zero even if Citibank survives.  However, since the Treasury will obtain only one share for every share obtained by other investors, it can&#8217;t have a majority stake.</p>
<p>Other holders of preferred shares are being told that they have to trade their preferred shares for common stock or Citibank will be allowed to fail.  The argument is that they can see how much they can get from Citibank or they can see how much they can get from a bankruptcy judge.  someone with 100 preferred shares will free ride.  Entities with large stakes will bargain with each other and Citibank and reach a deal.  Nothing concentrates the mind like imminent bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>after the jump, I speculate on the next step if this doesn&#8217;t solve the problem.</p>
<p>I suppose if Citibank is still insolvent after all institutions which own large amounts of preferred shares have converted to common stock, then the Treasury can announce a similar deal involving bondholders.  If they convert the bonds to common stock the Treasury will buy identical bonds and convert them to common stock (inject more cash money for common stock).</p>
<p>In bankruptcy bonds are converted to common stock.  The plan is to force large creditors of Citi do it now officially voluntarily without involving a judge, because otherwise there will be huge delays and losses.</p>

<p>What do You do With a Bunch of Unsold Cars?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/news/viewArticle.htm?articleId=20017621801&#038;printable=true">Lloyd&#8217;s List</a> had this story the other day:</p>
<blockquote><p>CAR manufacturer Toyota has so many unsold cars it has had to charter a ship to store them all.</p>
<p>Toyota said today it had chartered a 2,500-capacity vessel which will simply stand idle in port in Malmo, Sweden.</p>
<p>The vessel, belonging to car-carrier specialist Wallenius Wilhelmsen, is necessary because there is simply no more room to store cars at the Toyota import site in Malmo, the company said.</p>
<p>“We have space for 12,500 cars in Malmo, which acts as a distribution centre for all the Nordic countries,” said Toyota spokesman Etienne Plas. “But we have run out of space. We need the ship to store cars while they are waiting to be delivered. Hopefully we won’t need it for that long.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t have anything to add.<br />___________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>John &#8220;<a href="http://erin-obrien.blogspot.com/2009/02/shocking-admission.html">Don&#8217;t Say</a>&#8221; Boehner <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/us/politics/26budget.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;pagewanted=all">makes (or should make) Greg Mankiw cry</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Boehner likewise criticized Mr. Obama’s cap-and-trade emissions permits proposal, saying, “Cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes and killing American jobs, and that’s the last thing we need to do during these troubled economic times.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As the NYT reports, the Obama budget actually would (mostly) rebate the proceeds of selling the credits via the &#8216;Making Work Pay&#8217; credit, so Boehner is (mostly) lying about the tax increase part of the proposal.  The administration should be concerned that the implicit tax will be passed on for fairness and political reasons, and a conceptually good way to deal with that is to make people approximately whole in a way that doesn&#8217;t take away the price signal to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
<p>As for the job-killing business, I&#8217;d like to see any other job that Boehner would save in the name of inefficiency; jobs whose existence depends on free carbon emissions are being subsidized by the rest of society.  Of course it&#8217;s the net job creation or destruction that really matters.  Insofar as there&#8217;s not much net tax increase, usual arguments regarding incentive distortion of taxes don&#8217;t really apply, and the net proceeds would go to low-carbon energy infrastructure and R&#038;D that would be reasonably calculated to have substantial long-range returns, the job-killing claim looks histrionic.  But if you don&#8217;t have ideas, then I suppose there&#8217;s not much to do but try to pound the table.</p>

<p>In this post, I mentioned something which I have been thinking about.  It seems to me that many strategies of financial market participants are based on simultaneously believing that financial markets are efficient and inefficient.  If financial markets are efficient, then the way to maximize risk adjusted returns is to buy and hold the market.  If one is forced to bear some risk, say I bear the risk that I will get sick, then I might rationally hold another portfollio including health insurance, but I can&#8217;t gain by delegating management of my portfolio to someone who doesn&#8217;t know anything about my personal unavoidable risks.  </p>
<p>Therefore much employment in the financial services sector must be based on the conviction that markets aren&#8217;t efficient.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, many decisions seem to be made based on the assumption that financial markets are efficient.  For example, incentive contracts for traders reward them for short term risk adjusted returns.  Outsiders argue that it would be better to reward traders in restricted shares of the firm (which they can&#8217;t sell for a fixed period) so that they don&#8217;t sacrifice the long term interests of the firm in order to obtain high cash bonuses.  Silly outsiders, say the financiers, Samuelson proved decades ago that the optimal trading strategy doesn&#8217;t depend on the planning horizon.  Indeed he did under the assumption that the objective is the log of end of horizon wealth *and* that financial markets are efficient.  The logarithmic assumption can be relaced to any CRRA function so long as assets are geometric brownian motions so returns over all horizons are log normal.  The assumption that markets are efficient is absolutely necessary to the result.  </p>
<p>But if markets are efficient, the optimal incentive contract for a trader is &#8220;Your fired&#8221; and, if necessary, &#8220;If you are not out of the building in 15 minutes I will call the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>A blindingly obvious example, a maybe less obvious example, and some effort to understand how we managed to get to this doubleplusungood blackwhite after the jump.</p>
<p>The example is the case of  a speculative bubble which is bound to burst but has a small chance of bursting in any brief interval of time.   Let&#8217;s say that each period there is a 99% chance that the bubble continues to inflate and returns on the asset are higher than the safe interest rate.  In contrast 1% of the time the bubble bursts and returns on the asset are very large and negative so the expected return on the asset is always lower than the safe interest rate.  A rational investor would short the asset, although a rational risk averse investor may take a very small short position. </p>
<p> Now let&#8217;s assume that there are professional traders who understand all this and investors who don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>An investor who rewards traders in cash equal to the greater of  performance minus market performance and zero  will with probability 99% pay a positive reward after 1 period to a trader who goes long the asset.  If the investor fires the trader after 1 period in which the trader underperforms the market, then a rational risk averse trader will always buy more of the risky than its share of the market portfolio.  This for two reasons.  The return if she goes short has huge variance and the chance of keeping the valuable job is 99 times as high if she goes long.  The same result holds If the investor fires the trader after a few underperforming periods in a row. </p>
<p>Hiring a sophisticated trader and writing a short term incentive contract is a worse strategy than buying the market.</p>
<p>Now this is not an obscure example, so why were investors willing to accept short term incentive contracts.  Part of it, of course, is that the contracts are really written by managers, but why did people ever buy shares of investment banks ?  Didn&#8217;t they notice how incentives changes when partners became managers ?</p>
<p>I think the reason is that many people manage to simultaneously believe that markets are efficient and that smart traders can beat the market.  </p>
<p>How could such beliefs co-exist ?   Well first it is really necessary to believe that the efficient markets hypothesis is a good enough approximation that incentive contracts which would be optimal if it were true are not horribly bad, but not a good enough approximation that the conclusion that all traders are inferior to buying and holding the market.  This is not a logical contradiction, but people didn&#8217;t even feel the need to write down a model in which both are true and decide if it seemed reasonable.</p>
<p>My guess is that the cognitive dissonance is caused by the desire people have to believe that they are doing well and doing good.  The claim that financial markets are inefficient is associated with the idea that speculators hurt  non speculators.   Speculators are therefore sympathetic to the idea that financial markets are efficient, even though they have to believe that they aren&#8217;t perfectly efficient.</p>
<p>More crudely, active investors are restrained by regulations and have a perceived interest in reduced regulation.  Therefore they see efficient markets fanatics as political allies and take advice from them on, say, incentive contracts.  Thus two groups with diametrically opposite beliefs who both, to put it crudely, vote Republican, imagine that they agree even though they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Another example of shizzo finance is the use of the Black and Scholes formula to detect miss pricing of options.  One of the many assumptions needed for the original formula, and one that has not, to my knowledge, been  relaxed, is that the price of the underlying asset is a martingale.  This is a reasonable assumption if markets are efficient.  The formula can be used to test the efficient markets hypothesis along with a bunch of clearly false auxiliary hypotheses.   It can&#8217;t be used to find miss pricing under the assumption that financial markets aren&#8217;t efficient.  This strategy makes sense if one assumes that underlying assets must be efficiently priced but that options might or might not be efficiently priced.  That was a bold guess back when options were new.  It has become a silly idea now that they aren&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Suspend Mark-to-Market?</p>
<p><a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/essa/final_bill_section-by-section.pdf">Section 132</a> of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (&#8220;restates the SEC&#8217;s authority to suspend the application of FASB 157 if the SEC determines that it is in the public interest and protects investors&#8221;), is an important part of the solution to the current financial crisis, and may lessen the need for nationalization or taxpayer support.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fasb.org/st/summary/stsum157.shtml">FASB 157</a>, which only came into effect on Nov 15, 2007, is the mark-to-market accounting rule that requires financial assets to be adjusted based on their market value &#8211; &#8220;the price in an orderly transaction between market particpants to sell the asset or transfer the liability&#8230;.&#8221;  The intention of FASB is theoretically good &#8211; to increase transparency and information for investors, but its practical application has created serious problems.</p>
<p>1)  Banks are reluctant to, or can&#8217;t, sell impaired assets at a discount as those prices then become the basis for marking down the value of other assets in their portfolio, which directly reduces the Equity portion of the balance sheet, tri ggering all sorts of regulatory and market risk events.  This is a major impediment to setting up a Bad Bank.</p>
<p>2)  Is the market for impaired mortgage debt &#8220;orderly&#8221; defined as <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/orderlymarket.asp">Any market in which the supply and demand are reasonably equal?</a>  I would argue no, as the supply of impaired mortgage debt ($1T?)far outstrips the available pools of capital with an appetite for this debt.  Mortgage securities, in particular the more exotic types, are often described &#8220;no one knows what the value is.&#8221;  That is bull; give me, Sammy, the security and I would be able to price it using NPV of future cash flow.  The problem is there is so much uncertainty regarding the Probalitity of Default, and the Average Loss per Default that I would assign a very high discount rate to the cash flow, resulting in a low price for the security.  So the bank might now sell the asset strictly as a business decision.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that we have recently faced a situation where the major money-center banks would have been (we didn&#8217;t have FASB 157) insolvent on a mark-to-market accounting basis (liabilities exceed book value of equity), that is the<a href="http://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/history/191_210.pdf">Latin American Debt</a> crises of the 1980&#8217;s.  What solved that problem? </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/23/mark-to-market-opinions-columnists_recovery_stimulus.html?part%20ner=popstories">Two things are absolutely essential when fixing financial market problems: time and growth.</a> Time to work things out and growth to make working those things out easier. Mark-to-market accounting takes both of these away&#8230;&#8230;Because these accounting rules force banks to write off losses before they even happen, we lose time.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if we allow the banks not to write down assets, what will this look like?</p>
<blockquote><p>Banking is a unique industry. Unlike virtually any other industry on earth, banks deal in a product that never goes out of style &#8211; money. As long as a bank maintains adequate technology and human capital to compete in the marketplace, long-term profitability is virtually assured, because demand is assured. As long as a bank can generate positive cash flows, and as long as the NPV of these cash flows exceeds the NPV of the losses from the defaulted assets, then the present intrinsic value of that bank’s common equity is positive. <a href="http://www.minyanville.com/articles/C-bank-jpm-wfc-bailout-solvency/index/a/21280/p/1">A bank can therefore have a very negative net worth and still have a highly positive net present value</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>So is allowing the banks to operate with negative equity in HTM terms a free lunch? No. Carrying the non-earning toxic assets on their balance sheets will cause US banks to earn a lower return on assets over the next few years; this reduces the NPV of their common equity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not in any real world sense. And before shaking your head in sorrow at the fact that Bruce seemingly has lost it given the numbers in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267528">Table IV.B6.—Unfunded OASDI Obligations for 1935 (Program Inception)Through the Infinite Horizon</a> which clearly show a $4.3 trillion dollar gap over the 75 year window and a $13.6 trillion gap over &#8216;Infinite Horizon&#8217;, consider that obviously I know the Table exists, in fact here it is.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SaV6gOsq7hI/AAAAAAAAAGg/64I6RAepCbU/s1600-h/Table+IV.B6.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SaV6gOsq7hI/AAAAAAAAAGg/64I6RAepCbU/s400/Table+IV.B6.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Plus its brother which throws a $17.4 trillion and a $15.6 trillion at us. Meaning that depending on how you define it and what time period you chose the Trustees tell us the unfunded obligation runs somewhere between $4.3 trillion and $17.4 trillion (source of the &#8216;$17.4 trillion backwards transfer). <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267012">Table IV.B7.—Present Values of OASDI Cost Less Tax Revenue and Unfunded Obligations for Program Participant</a><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SaV6gHDKY-I/AAAAAAAAAGo/9xSIMo2yAf4/s1600-h/Table+IV.B7.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SaV6gHDKY-I/AAAAAAAAAGo/9xSIMo2yAf4/s400/Table+IV.B7.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> Click to enlarge either table.<br />Given that how can I possibly claim that the &#8216;Unfunded Liability&#8217; doesn&#8217;t exist? Because unless you are the Commissioner of Social Security or one of the Trustees it just doesn&#8217;t equate to a real life event. To understand why you would need to follow me under the fold.</p>
<p>The key is to understand that the Commissioner and the Trustees are constrained by current law. While the Trustees tend to talk about events at depletion as being automatic<br />
<blockquote>If no action were taken until the combined trust funds become exhausted in 2041, then the effects of changes would be more concentrated on fewer years and fewer cohorts:<br />•<br />For example, payroll taxes could be raised to finance scheduled benefits fully in every year starting in 2041. In this case, the payroll tax would be increased to 15.94 percent at the point of trust fund exhaustion in 2041 and continue rising to 16.60 percent in 2082.<br />•<br />Similarly, benefits could be reduced to the level that is payable with scheduled tax rates in each year beginning in 2041. Under this scenario, benefits would be reduced 22 percent at the point of trust fund exhaus tion in 2041, with reductions reaching 25 percent in 2082.</p></blockquote>
<p> in fact they are not, the Commissioner and the Trustees having neither the authority to change the benefit schedule or the FICA rate, that being reserved to Congress. Which one way or another will simply eliminate some or most of the so-called &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217;.</p>
<p>Currently Social Security is faced with certain &#8216;inflection&#8217; points. One is Shortfall, the date that income excluding interest (i.e. tax) falls behind total cost. Under Intermediate Cost projections that is set at 2017. At that point some of the accrued interest on the Trust Fund which heretofore had simply been &#8216;funded&#8217; by crediting the TF with Special Treasuries (which are not funded with current year borrowing) instead has to come from the General Fund. Initially the effect is small, the Trust Fund continuing to grow right to the point that all interest has to be funded by current year borrowing. This point which I call &#8216;Peak&#8217; is projected for 2023. After Peak funding full benefits means redeeming the accumulated Special Treasuries until they are gone. This event is called TF Depletion and under SSA projections is set for 2041. (The CBO uses somewhat different calculations and gets different dates but that is immaterial for the purposes of this discussion).</p>
<p>Now people vary on whether we should see Shortfall or Peak or Depletion as the key date for &#8216;Crisis&#8217; but come what may under Intermediate Cost assumptions at some point Congress has to act, precisely because the Trustees are constrained by current law. Lets say Congress just decides to procrastinate right to Depletion. At this point they have some choices. They could raise FICA by 3.54% points or they could cut benefits by 22% or they could do some combination or they could do what the Greenspan Commission did and just do enough to kick the problem down the road for another 30 or 40 years. But whatever they do at a stroke they eliminate most to all of the &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217;. Because tax increases serve to fund the liability while benefit cuts serve to eliminate it and there is no third alternative being that the Commissioner has no ability to borrow money.</p>
<p>Seen properly &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; is just a fictive artifact stemming from the Trustees having to assume current law. If they are able to pay full benefits they are obligated to do so, to that extent there is a liability. But it is limited, if Congress decides to fund that liability it will be paid, if Congress deliberately decides not to the liability goes away.</p>
<p>It is useful and even crucially important to understand the gap between projected revenue and projected cost at the point of Trust Fund depletion. It is equally useful but not particularly important to examine that gap in some future year. What is not useful is to sum up those amounts and hang them like the Sword of Damocles over our heads. The summed gaps are not legal liabilities because Congress is free to eliminate them. Now some might consider them moral liabilities and potentially the needed changes would lead to some political liabilities for that future Congress, but the notion that every child born in America automatically inherits $150,000 in unfunded debt is hooey. Because before 2041 actions will be taken to either fund that debt or write it off and poof that &#8216;Unfunded Liability&#8217; vanishes.</p>
<p>_________________<br />On a somewhat different note I would ask you to take a look at Table IV.B7. First it tells us there is a $17.4 trillion dollar gap between future tax revenues and future costs for &#8216;Current participants&#8217;. This is the source of the claim that the problem is do to over generosity to people in the past. This is just not true, examination of the Tables shows that every penny of that $17.4 trillion is &#8216;owed&#8217; to a subset of retirees projected to be drawing benefits between 2041 and 2108. The Report puts it as follows:<br />
<blockquote>The first line of table IV.B7 shows that the present value of future cost less future taxes over the next 100 years for all current participants equals $17.4 trillion. For this purpose, current participants are defined as individuals who attain age 15 or older in 2008. Subtracting the current value of the trust fund (the accumulated value of past OASDI taxes less cost) gives a closed group (excluding all future participants) unfunded obligation of $15.2 trillion. This value represents the shortfall of lifetime contributions for all past and current participants relative to the lifetime costs associated with their generations. For a fully‑advance‑funded program this value would be equal to zero.</p></blockquote>
<p> This may be the most political passage in the main body of the Report which by and large is pretty straightforward. Then again the whole notion of &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217; wasn&#8217;t introduced until the 2003 Report and it is hard to not suspect that the motivation was political. Because the language is carefully crafted to put the blame on &#8216;past and current participants&#8217; while giving &#8216;future participants&#8217; a pass, leaving of course Gen-Xers to bath in their sense of being persecuted by Boomers. But in point of fact no Gen-Xer is a &#8216;future participant&#8217; instead they are all classified as &#8216;current participants&#8217; and the vast bulk of the projected gap is due to them not being able to fund their own benefits after 2041 and before 2108. A fact that is shown that once you subtract out the excess contributions of &#8216;past and current participants&#8217; (i.e. the current Trust Fund) the gap drops to $15.2 trillion.</p>
<p>Which brings up a second point. &#8216;Past participants&#8217; (i.e. dead people) are clearly paid up, those checks already cashed. And those &#8216;current participants&#8217; who will be dead by 2041 are also paid up. Now those Boomers who will be living for some years after 2041 are on the hook for some portion of the $4.3 trillion of &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; over the 2041-2082 but not that much being that the total gap between 2008-2057 is just .94% of payroll and not all of that due to us. Instead most of the gap coming in that third 25 year window <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#274087">Table IV.B4.—Components of Summarized Income Rates and Cost Rates, Calendar Years 2008-82[As a percentage of taxable payroll]</a>. Further lets look at the significance of these numbers:<br />$2.2 trillion = Trust Fund i.e excess contributions by past and current participants (including all Boomers)<br />-$4.3 trillion = Gap between tax and cost between 2041 and 2082 less credit for the TF (partially due to Boomers)<br />-$6.5 trillion = Total gap between tax and cost between 2041 and 2082 for all participants (including some future participants born between 1993 and 2015)</p>
<p>-$17.4 trillion = Total gap between tax and cost between 2041 and 2108 for current participants<br />-$15.2 trillion = Total gap between tax and cost between 2041 and 2108 less credit for the TF<br />-$13.6 trillion = Total gap between tax and cost between 2041 and Infinite Future after including the $1.5 trillion surplus from future participants.</p>
<p>So future participants are responsible for a small portion of the $6.5 trillion gap between 2041 and 2082. As are Boomers. But mostly you are talking about Gen-X and leading edge Millenials not paying their way.</p>
<p>Similarly future participants are not at all responsible for that $17.4 gap for current and past participants between 2041 and 2108. Nor are past participants, indeed many of them contributed to the Trust Fund that reduces that gap to $15.2 trillion. And by 2041 Boomers will range from old to dead. Meaning once again we are talking about Gen-X and leading edge Millenials not paying their way.</p>
<p> So when you add it all up almost all of this liability derives from the retirees of 2058-2108 not including any of those born after 1993. The very youngest Boomer will be 94 in 2058. And any of our grandkids born after 1993 will actually be contributing to a long term surplus. Meaning almost all of the problem derives from Gen-Xers and leading Millenials scheduled to get some $14+ trillion or so of extra benefits over contributions.</p>
<p>&#8216;Backwards transfer&#8217; my ass. Instead Boomers not only paid benefits for the Greatest Generation, we are projected to pay almost all of our own benefits and now are asked to take cuts so that Gen-X doesn&#8217;t feel aggrieved by adjustments to benefits after around 2029. Whereas if they just got off the couch and grew the economy like Boomers and our parents and grandparents did everybody gets paid in full.</p>
<p>But I guess it is more fun to whine about &#8216;Selfish Boomers&#8217; than to do the actual arithmetic.</p>

<p>Felix Salmon has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-03/wp_quant?currentPage=all">a fascinating article</a> on the Gaussian Copula.  Obviously I had noticed that financial market participants had made some mistakes in the recent past, but I had no idea how crazy they had been.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that one implication of Salmon&#8217;s article is that the invention of the CDS was very unfortunate event.  Oddly I recall him arguing the opposite position.  I don&#8217;t see how he can after writing</p>
<blockquote><p>For five years, Li&#8217;s formula, known as a Gaussian copula function, looked like an unambiguously positive breakthrough, </p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>Then the model fell apart. Cracks started appearing early on, when financial markets began behaving in ways that users of Li&#8217;s formula hadn&#8217;t expected. The cracks became full-fledged canyons in 2008—when ruptures in the financial system&#8217;s foundation swallowed up trillions of dollars and put the survival of the global banking system in serious peril.</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>When the price of a credit default swap goes up, that indicates that default risk has risen. Li&#8217;s breakthrough was that instead of waiting to assemble enough historical data about actual defaults, which are rare in the real world, he used historical prices from the CDS market.</p></blockquote>
<p>Foolish reliance on  Li&#8217;s model lead to disaster and it was made possible by CDS markets which convinced participants that they had many observations on the probability of default.  They were convinced that prices revealed these probabilities because they had an insane mystical faith in the strong form efficient markets hypothesis and a schizophrenic simultaneous belief that they could beat the market.</p>
<p>If the only problem with CDSs is that they supplied those nut cases with the prices which they missused in calculations, that would, I think, be enough to show that the world would have been better off if CDSs had been banned.  </p>
<p>I rant more after the jump.</p>
<p>here and there on the web, I typed that I think that high trading volume leads to volatility, that liquid markets are a bad thing and, in particular, that the fact that the market for CDSs has higher trading volume than the market for the underlying bonds is a very bad thing.  I forget where someone asks me if I reject the &#8220;price revelation&#8221; argument in general.  I do.  </p>
<p>Financial market participants managed to convince themselves that they could beat efficient markets (already a logical contradition) because the market price of a CDS was an accurate enough measure of the probability of defaults that correlations in the changes in the prices of 2 CDSs could be used to estimate the (assumed to be constant) correlation between two (assumed to be normal) latent variables making it possible to estimate the probability that two bonds would both default.  </p>
<p>That is they assumed that market prices contained information which no one even claimed to be able to obtain any other way.  So how did the information get into the prices.  One hypothesis is that the Zeitgeist exists and has rational expectations.  I can&#8217;t think of another explanation.</p>
<p>Now given what market participants did with a whole lot of prices which changed very often, I think it is a bad thing to give them a whole lot of prices which change often.  That is one reason why it would have been better if the CDS had never been invented.  </p>
<p>My comment over at &#8220;Wired&#8221;</p>
<p>Felix</p>
<p>I recall a aol instant messenger debate we had about CDSs.  You position was that they were useful since the CDS market is more liquid than the underlying bond markets.  It seems to me that this article is demolishes your position.  Liquid markets generate a huge number of numbers.  They are used by traders to price assets and control risk.  According to this article such use has recently destroyed the financial system.  One of the many many problems is that Li assumed that the CDS market was efficient.  This means that without a CDS market, people recognised that they couldn&#8217;t calculate the probability of default exactly, but once there were CDS they thought the market price contained that information.  Where did it come from ?  Why the magic of the strong form efficient markets hypothesis.  </p>
<p>If no one can learn something, then it can&#8217;t be reflected in the market price.  Not a subtle point.  To believe that CDS prices are probabilities one has to abandone methodological individualism, that is believe in the rationality of the Zeitgeist or something.  I can believe that I don&#8217;t know something, but other people do and they trade on markets so the market price will tell me something about their secret information.  I can&#8217;t believe that no one knows something but it is still equal to the price at which markets populated by the ignorant people trade.  </p>
<p>Traders were not only mystical, they were schizophrenic.  They assume that markets are efficient and then try to beat the market.  If the market is efficient, the best trading strategy is to buy and hold the market.  If it is inefficient, then CDS prices are not probabilities.  The trading strategies which brought down the system are only rational if some prices but not others are known to be rational.  How can anyone have claimed with a straight face to believe such a thing.</p>
<p>The assumption that correlations are constant is another quite separate gross error as is the assumption that the distribution of something is normal, because it would be nice if it was.  Both mean that the number &#8220;99%&#8221; which you type while noting that it is not 100% was not the true probability.</p>
<p>In any case, liquid markets were very damaging, because without them, people could not have made the same mistakes.  Price revelation had huge negative social value because beliefs based on the prices were further from the truth than those people would have had without the prices.  Traders might have been equally wrong about the expected value, but, if they had known they were ignorant, their subjective probabilities would have been close to true probabilities and we would all be much richer.</p>

<p>is still trying to learn journalistic arithmetic.  <br />Recently I learned that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/500000-0.html">500,000 = 0</a> Now <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/02/24/poll-obamas-speech-scored-with-viewers/">I learn from CNN</a> that I got to restudy fractions or division or something as it seems that &#8220;two thirds&#8221; is equal to 92% </p>
<p>
<blockquote> A new national poll indicates that two-thirds of those who watched President Obama&#8217;s address to a joint session of Congress reacted favorably to his speech.</p>
<p>Sixty-eight percent of speech-watchers questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey Tuesday night had a very positive reaction to the president&#8217;s address, with 24 percent suggesting they had a somewhat positive response and 8 percent indicating they had a negative reaction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now when I was learned percent and fractions 68% + 24% = 92% > 2/3. </p>
<p>I know that it is not <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2008/07/ballance-at-washington-post-i-use-word.html">ballanced</a> to report the simple fact that 92% of people in the poll had a positive reaction, but better an unballanced fact than a ballanced falsehood. </p>
<p>CNN would have been approximately correct if they were to have written &#8220;A new national poll indicates that two-thirds of those who watched President Obama&#8217;s address to a joint session of Congress reacted [very] favorably to his speech,&#8221; although it would still be unclear to me why the phrase in the question &#8220;very positive reaction&#8221; should be replaced by something else &#8220;reacted very favorably.&#8221;  I know there is a rule of style that words are not to be repeated, but given the importance of exact wording in polls I think that rule of style demands inaccuracy.</p>
