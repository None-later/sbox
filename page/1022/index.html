                                <p>John Tamny must not have liked this <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/kudlow-malpass-tamny-definition-of.html">post</a> emailing me to say:<br />
<blockquote>Believe me, I understand per capita and real. And don&#8217;t think for a second that I don&#8217;t see the obvious flaw in the household wealth argument: the dollar has fallen pretty substantially in the past year (though you don&#8217;t believe in measuring commodities in terms of gold so you&#8217;d probably have some argument here too), so the growth in wealth in the past year is at best only in nominal terms. </p></blockquote>
<p>He understands the need to express wealth over time in real terms &#8211; so what&#8217;s his excuse for doing his discussion in nominal terms?  Assuming he did not wish to flat out lie to his NRO readers, let&#8217;s see if we can understand this bit about commodity price indices, which he must get from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200508091255.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a>:<br />
<blockquote>If you prefer a commodity-price-rule approach to monetary policy, the following will beg your attention.  The Commodity Research Bureau’s spot commodity index (which excludes oil and gold) has been flat for about 19 months, stretching all the way back to early 2004. This commodity flattening follows the sharp commodity recovery of 2002-03, which itself followed a protracted period of commodity deflation that reached back to the 1997-2001 period.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that I only consume <em>only</em> commodities (yes, bauxite tastes much better than a hamburger).  This Commodity Research Bureau’s spot commodity index rose by 29.4% from December 1999 to June 2005, while the GDP deflator rose by only 13.4% over the period that Tamny and I focused upon.  Does Tamny not know this?  Does he not realize by his and Kudlow&#8217;s weird measure of the cost of living that real wealth would have declined even in absolute terms.  Does anyone who attempts to write economic editorials at the National Review even bother to check their own data?</p>

<blockquote><p>Global saving and investment rates have fallen and current account imbalances have widened to unprecedented levels, yet real long-term interest rates remain low in most countries. How did the global economy arrive at this position?</p></blockquote>
<p>Before turning to how the IMF answered this question, let go back four years when certain pro-growth liberals were hammering the Bush Administration for its fiscal irresponsibility and resulting lower national savings, which we have illustrated in the first diagram.  We can all recall some of the Bush apologists saying something along the line of the U.S. being just a small part of a large financial market.  I guess if we wanted to be mean we might have fired back &#8220;and your point was what&#8221;. </p>

<p>Ben Bernanke&#8217;s global savings glut thesis provided an answer.  You see &#8211; our story would have predicted higher real interest rates and Bernanke suggested the fact that real interest rates fell might suggest an outward shift of the world savings curve &#8211; as in figure 2.  Note, however, the X in both diagrams indicating that both price (real interest rates) and quantity (world saving = world investment) have fallen.</p>

<p>The IMF notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some have argued that the catalyst is the substantial changes that have taken  place in Asia,  where saving has risen but investment has collapsed since the late 1990s.  According to this view, the swing in the saving-investment gap &#8211; from  deficit to large surplus &#8211; in emerging Asia has resulted in an excess global supply  of saving (a global saving “glut”)  that has been channeled to the United States  to finance its large current account imbalance  (Bernanke, 2005). At the same time,  this would explain the low level of long-term real interest rates, which is needed to equilibrate desired saving and planned investment on a global basis. Others have argued that the sharp drop in national saving in the United States &#8211; reflecting the <br />deterioration in the fiscal position and the increase in housing wealth &#8211; and the recent rebound in investment are at the root of current account imbalances  (see, for example, Roubini and Setser, 2005). Thus, according to these observers, current global imbalances are mainly the result of policy decisions &#8211; both fiscal and monetary &#8211; in the United States. By itself, however, this would not explain the low level of real interest rates, as a higher demand for net saving from the United <br />States would lead (everything else equal) to higher, not lower, global interest rates &#8230; unusually low investment rates across the globe are a contributing factor to low real long-term interest rates. In addition, the chapter also finds that the current pattern of external imbalances largely reflects a series of diverse and unrelated regional developments.</p></blockquote>
<p>The IMF report includes figure 2.1 (Global Saving, Investment, and Current Accounts Percent of world GDP), which shows world savings and investment since 1970:</p>
<blockquote><p>Global saving and investment have been trending downward since the early 1970s. They reached historic lows in 2002, and have recovered modestly since then &#8230; These global trends mainly reflect developments in the industrial countries, where both saving and investment have been trending downward since the 1970s. In contrast, saving in the emerging market and oilproducing economies has risen over this period, while investment, after increasing substantially up to the time of the Asian financial crisis, has since fallen and remains below the levels of the mid-1990s. As a result of these trends, the industrial country share of global saving and investment has dropped from about 85 percent in 1970 to 70 percent at present.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/si3-700380.JPG"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/si3-798731.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Our third figure shows an inward shift of the investment demand.  However, note that with our assumption of a low saving schedule elasticity with respect to interest rates (which the IMF suggests is the case), an inward shift of the invesment demand schedule does not fully explain the decline in  world saving = world investment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/07/should_we_worry.html">James Hamilton</a> provided a similar time series graph for the U.S. alone showing how our savings rate has declined over time.  Figure 2.2 of the IMF report extends the time series to the Euro Area, Japan, and other industrial nations.  While these other industrial nations are not running current account deficits, their contributions to world savings have declined over time as well. </p>
<p>If we compare Hamilton&#8217;s measure of U.S. net national savings, which is running at approximately 2% of U.S. income to Michael Mandel&#8217;s measure of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/wealth-and-savings-mandel-gets-it-half.html">real wealth</a> over time, we would get a similar result for the past five or six years.  Wealth accumulation has been slower than population growth for the U.S.  In other words, the U.S. propensity to borrow rather than save for its investment has led to a fall in per capita wealth as well as an inward shift of the world savings schedule.  </p>
<p>The IMF report does have a glimmer of good news.  Savings and investment in the U.S. have recently increased.  As <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/10/but_you_said_th.html">James Hamilton</a> noted, more savings is a good thing.</p>

<blockquote>Does today&#8217;s CPI release indicate that inflation has returned? &#8230; Pick your poison, inflation or recession. Personally I&#8217;m more scared of the second.</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to return to a debate between Dick Cheney and John Kerry last summer as to whether real wages were rising or declining.  Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers in real terms (1982$) were hovering around $8.30 at the end of 2003.  By June 2003 &#8211; the month that the Washington Post accused Senator Kerry of lying &#8211; real wages had fallen to $8.20.  A year later, they were still $8.20.  The reported figure for September 2005 was $8.05.</p>

                                <p>The latest from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/14/AR2005101402076.html">Karl Rove’s attorney</a> says it all:<br />
<blockquote>Rove&#8217;s defense team asserts that President Bush&#8217;s deputy chief of staff has not committed a crime but nevertheless anticipates that special prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald could find a way to bring charges in the next two weeks, the source said.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, it does not matter what Bill Frist really knew about the true standing of HCA when he sold the stock, it does not matter how many ethical violations and violations of Texas law Tom DeLay really committed, or in how many ways Karl Rove undermined the CIA – they are all Republicans.  Forget all the hypocrisy from those former prosecutors in the Reagan DOJ who now make money pimping for the rightwing.  All of their nonsense is true by definition.  The Rule of Law party is above the law.  Karl Rove must be innocent – regardless of the facts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=6211&#038;R=C74716908X">Jeffrey Bell and William Kristol</a> are worried about the criminalization of leading Republicans:<br />
<blockquote>What do these four men have in common, other than their status as prosecutorial targets? Since 2001, they have been among the most prominent promoters of the conservative agenda of the Bush administration. For over four years, they have helped two strong conservatives, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, successfully advance an agenda for change in America. To the extent these four are sidelined, there is a real chance that the Bush-Cheney administration will become less successful &#8230; But it&#8217;s a reasonable bet that the fall of 2005 will be remembered as a time when it became clear that a comprehensive strategy of criminalization had been implemented to inflict defeat on conservatives who seek to govern as conservatives.</p></blockquote>
<p>The four men are Tom DeLay, Bill Frist, Karl Rove, and Scooter Libby.  I guess Mr. Kristol does not consider such trivial matters as insider trading and the outing of CIA agents to be crimes.</p>

                                <p>Suppose your company is considering purchasing another company and wishes to convince the Department of Justice (DOJ) that the benefits to shareholders come from efficiency-enhancing effects and not competition-reducing effects.  One could hire a team of economists from a host of consulting firms such as <a href="http://www.crai.com/category.asp?typeid=7&#038;id=1">these</a> <a href="http://www.lecg.com/website/home.nsf/OpenPage/AntitrustCompetition">two</a>. Or supposed you simply wished to learned how these issues have been addressed more and more by good economic analysis.  You might start with the various articles collected by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0195161181/002-2259051-4961632?v=glance">John E. Kwoka and Lawrence J. White</a>.  As <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/10/off_in_bizarrow.html">Brad DeLong</a> recently noted, the National Review writers often opine on matters that they don’t take the time to understand.  Forgive me for the following long post, but the attack on economists and the DOJ from this crowd has my dander up.</p>
<p>A little over a year ago, Judge Walker ruled in favor of Oracle’s bid to acquire PeopleSoft.  <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/anderson200510060753.asp">Stuart Anderson</a> decides now to attack the DOJ and <a href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~kge8z">Kenneth G. Elzinga</a>:<br />
<blockquote>While the Soviet Union is a distant memory, the notion that a small group of people can figure out what is best for a nation’s economy is alive and well in an unlikely place — the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) … A year can be a lifetime in the world of software and high technology. Yet based on the preferences of lawyers in the DOJ’s antitrust division, companies may be forced to wait years before moving ahead with an acquisition. Every purchase or merger involving real money prompts a review by antitrust enforcers, whose power is immense. Under the current procedures, companies must first submit documents explaining an acquisition and implicitly answering any possible objections from the DOJ. If the antitrust division is not satisfied in the “first round,” it can ask for more information. To comply with this second, more expansive request is generally considered so time-consuming and disruptive that most companies withdraw an acquisition at this stage rather than endure the costly process, according to industry sources … The policy question for Republicans is this: Why after so roundly criticizing the Clinton administration for its antitrust policies &#8211; including the case against Microsoft &#8211; has the Bush administration allowed career lawyers at the DOJ to promulgate essentially the same policies? In attempting to block Oracle’s acquisition of PeopleSoft, SEC filings show that the DOJ ended up costing Oracle close to $100 million, not including the indirect costs of forcing the chairman, president, and other executives to spend weeks in depositions and, more generally, distracting them from their primary duties of running a major U.S. corporation. The judge in the case disclosed that the DOJ paid one of its expert witnesses, an economist, over $1 million. No doubt it would have been front-page news if this economist had worked for Halliburton. Ultimately, in an embarrassing rebuke, the judge ruled squarely against the DOJ, but much of the damage had already been done.</p></blockquote>
<p>In his attack on Dr. Elzinga and DOJ, Anderson displays little to no understanding of the issues involved in this litigation. <a href="http://www.shearman.com/publications/at_pubs.html">Shearman &#038; Sterling&#8217;s Antitrust group</a> provides a nice summary of the Court’s reasoning:<br />
<blockquote>In particular, Judge Walker rejected DOJ’s product market definition that the relevant market consisted only of high function (sales in excess of $500,000) financial and human resource management enterprise resource planning software (“ERP”), sold only by Oracle, Peoplesoft and SAP. Judge Walker found instead that Microsoft and Lawson participated in the market, as well as mid-market vendors, best of breed solution companies, and other companies providing outsourcing. In addition, Judge Walker rejected DOJ’s geographic market definition, finding the market for business software was a global one, and not limited to the United States. Consequently, Judge Walker concluded that DOJ had failed to establish that the merged firm could exercise market power and thus, that the merger would substantially lessen competition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Elzinga had originally argued that the relevant definition of the market included U.S. providers of high-function financial and human-resources enterprise applications software, which was essentially a duopoly before the merger of Oracle and PeopleSoft.  <a href="http://econ-www.mit.edu/faculty/?prof_id=hausman">Jerry Hausman</a> of MIT testified on behalf of Oracle and noted that SAP of Germany was also part of the world market for such software.  Oracle also argued that the market should include other entities such as Lawson Software, which the Court saw as providing mid-market products.  </p>
<p>Clearly, the definition of the relevant market is central to whether a proposed merger will reduce the degree of competition. Alas, the National Review defines “damage” in terms of not being able to extract wealth from the stock market with little concern about the possible damage to consumers or overall economic efficiency if a merger does create market power.  </p>
<p>But Anderson went further in his insulting the economists who worked on this litigation by questioning why experts were paid in the first place.  Compare the resumes of Dr. Hausman and Dr. Elzinga to the <a href="http://www.gpc.edu/~jcox">guru</a> responsible for this:<br />
<blockquote>The antitrust division of the DOJ continues to be guided by poor precedent. In 1911, the U.S. government separated Standard Oil into 33 entities — not because the company raised prices but because a judge decided it had concentrated various parts of the production process under one umbrella. Even before the case was settled, Standard Oil’s market share fell from 90 percent to 60 percent.  The case of Alcoa Aluminum in 1945 was “equally absurd,” notes economist Jim Cox. Alcoa was the dominant producer of primary aluminum in the United States. Yet similar to the Standard Oil case, there is no evidence that the company either restricted its output or raised prices. Yet here, too, the decision went against Alcoa. These decisions reflect the mindset by which DOJ antitrust lawyers today evaluate acquisitions that cross their desks. Jim Cox points out that in the case of Alcoa, a judge had to restrict the definition of the market to “primary” aluminum, ignoring the competition represented by reprocessed aluminum. In the Standard Oil case, the judge did not address or take seriously imported oil as a competitive factor. “In other words, the courts had to first artificially narrow the market in order to find these companies guilty,” says Cox. Narrowing the market and ignoring the potential entry of new competitors are common methods used by the DOJ to block acquisitions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not to go after Jim Cox, but I would more faith in Dr. Hausman or Dr. Elzinga on these issues.  Anderson also seems to be upset that the economists who provided testimony in this litigation were well compensated.  Economists who are well trained in economics put a lot of effort and their own reputations on the line when they testify for clients – whether the client is the government or the corporations who wish to merge.  Oracle was well served by Dr. Hausman.  </p>
<p>But let’s go back a couple of years for perhaps the dumbest op-ed written by <a href="http://www.poorandstupid.com/2003_03_02_chronArchive.asp#90408672">Donald Luskin</a>.  Here are my favorite parts of his attack on the DOJ’s anti-trust division in regards a proposed merger between Dreyer’s and Nestle:<br />
<blockquote>Let&#8217;s take a look at what was behind the FTC&#8217;s decision &#8211; a decision which inserts the power of government to disrupt a voluntary and mutually sought combination of two private businesses, a decision that slashed a billion dollars in market value from the stock of Dreyer&#8217;s last night as soon as it was announced. The essence of it as that the FTC believes that &#8220;that the elimination of Dreyer&#8217;s would likely lead to anticompetitive effects in the market for superpremium ice cream.&#8221; Did you know, before this, that there even was something called &#8220;the market for superpremium ice cream&#8221;? Well, there is now. Imagine some incredibly complex diagram covering the wall in the office of some Ph. D. at the FTC&#8217;s offices in Washington showing &#8220;the market for food.&#8221; Now erase everything that isn&#8217;t &#8220;the market for deserts,&#8221; and then erase everything that isn&#8217;t &#8220;the market for frozen deserts,&#8221; and then erase everything that isn&#8217;t &#8220;the market for ice cream.&#8221; In that tiny little sub-sub-sub-sub-market, Dreyers&#8217; brands Dreamery, Godiva and Starbucks battle it out with Nestlé&#8217;s Häagen Dazs, and Unilever&#8217;s Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s. The big issue, according to the FTC &#8212; the reason for government to intervene and cost Dreyer&#8217;s shareholders a billion dollars &#8212; is that  &#8220;this deal will reduce the number of significant competitors from three to two&#8221; and &#8220;would likely raise prices and reduce choice for consumers.&#8221; But, even granting that the government ought to be concerned with such matters at all, none of it means a thing in this case unless you accept the idea of &#8220;the market for superpremium ice cream&#8221; as a meaningful reality. Who&#8217;s to say that&#8217;s a market of any importance? Who&#8217;s to say that market needs the government to interfere with private business decisions to be sure that there&#8217;s a certain amount of competition in it &#8212; or any competition at all? Let&#8217;s say that there were so little competition in &#8220;the market for superpremium ice cream&#8221; that choice was narrowed to a single brand and prices became astronomical. What if &#8220;the market for superpremium ice cream&#8221; vanished from the face of the earth altogether? So what? Consumers could simply buy any of dozens of premium, regular, or cheap-o ice cream brands instead &#8212; or some other desert. Let them eat superpremium cake! Even if we grant that &#8220;the market for superpremium ice cream&#8221; needs to be policed for competition, who&#8217;s to say that the correct number of competitors is two rather than three? Is it always better to have more competitors in a market? In this country we have only two political parties of any influence &#8212; would we be better off with more, like Italy or Israel? Maybe we would,  in which case we are free to have them &#8211; or not. But in the case of ice cream &#8212; or rather, superpremium ice cream &#8211; we are not free to have less than three. And why should we necessarily be concerned that prices might rise with a drop in the number of competitors? First, there&#8217;s no axiomatic reason to be absolutely positive that prices would rise in the first place. And what&#8217;s the correct price for superpremium ice cream, anyway? Maybe prices should go up &#8211; maybe today&#8217;s prices are too low. To insist arbitrarily that lower prices are always better &#8211; and to bring government power to bear to make sure that they are &#8211; amounts to a form of price controls in the name of antitrust. It takes what should be a free bargaining process between producer and consumer and stacks it in favor of the consumer. But why are people who make ice cream less entitled to equal protection under the laws than people who eat ice cream?</p></blockquote>
<p>Where to begin with such insanity?  First of all, I love superpremium ice cream and pound cake is not a perfect substitute.  So much for understanding what the relevant market is.  Secondly, Luskin shows his hand as far as his lack of knowledge about basic economics and well is his desire to make money off the stock market even at the expense of economic efficiency (never mind that those who take his investment advice typically lose money as in “they are poor because he is stupid”).</p>
<p>It seems neither Anderson nor Luskin seem to even understand the process, which allows for the corporations to hire economists to make their case that the merger is efficiency increasing rather than competition reducing.  Of course, neither Anderson nor Luskin have an integrity nor expertise on anything, which is why they are asked to write for rags such as the National Review and why your company would be ill-advised to hire them as your economic experts.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>When I began reading the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/kaza200510140859.asp">Greg Kaza</a>, I thought “ho-hum, more NRO cheerleading”:<br />
<blockquote>Bearish critics overlook the dynamic spirit of American capitalism, its risk-taking entrepreneurs, and the economy’s resiliency. They also overlook broad indicators like the output of the nation’s mines, factories, and utilities (industrial production), and nonfarm employment, which both show an economy that keeps on growing.</p></blockquote>
<p>But then he linked to a <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/kaza200502180852.asp">previous post</a> having something to do with exogenous theories of the business cycle:<br />
<blockquote>Against Keynes, capital-based economists argue that “intervention by the monetary authorities [is] the ultimate source of recession.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If we are thinking that this sounds a lot like the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=15480.0">Austrian theory</a>, you’d be correct:<br />
<blockquote>His theory claimed that credit creation by monetary authorities would push investment beyond society&#8217;s long-term willingness to save, creating a mismatch between supply and demand that would inevitably cause recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>And yet, some Keynesians might attribute the fall in investment demand that began just as President Bush was taking office to the tight monetary policies of 1999 and 2000.  So once again, I’m trying to figure out what is Mr. Kaza’s point – beyond cheerleading.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The fall in the deficit might look like more for the Bush crowd to cheer about until one reads the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/10/14/federaldeficit.ap/index.html">details</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8211; The federal deficit hit $319 billion for the budget year that just ended, down significantly from last year&#8217;s record red ink, although a surge in Katrina-driven spending threatens to drive the shortfall up again. The improvement from the record $412 billion recorded in the 2004 budget year, which the Treasury Department reported on Friday, is largely due to a surge in federal revenues from an improving economy.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This week&#8217;s news will probably be dominated by Wilma and Fitzgerald.  And the top economic story will likely be Q3 GDP.  But I&#8217;ll also be looking at the Existing Home Sales and New Home Sales reports for further clues of a housing slowdown.</p>
<p>Expectations are for strong volumes for both existing and new home sales.  The consensus estimate is for an annual rate of 7.2 million existing homes sold, just below the record of 7.35 million in June and the still strong 7.29 million units in August.</p>
<p>As a reminder, existing home sales are reported at the close of escrow, usually 30 to 60 days after the contract is signed.  New Home Sales are reported in the month the contract is signed, so New Home Sales are a more up-to-date indicator of activity in the housing market.</p>
<p>For new homes, the consensus estimate is for an annual rate of 1.25 million homes, slightly better than for August.  Although sales volumes will probably still be strong, it will be interesting to see if inventories have continued to rise.  For existing homes, inventories hit 2.856 million in August, the highest level since 1989.  And for new homes, inventories set a record of 480 thousand units in August.</p>
<p>California has lead the housing boom, so the following articles might offer clues to the impact of a slowdown.  The San Diego Union Tribune reports:  <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20051021-1655-ca-califjobs.html">California lost 23,700 jobs in September</a>, but statewide construction hiring was still strong:<br />
<blockquote>The construction sector saw the largest gain in August, up by 3,300 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis. &#8230; For the year, the construction industry has added the most jobs, 58,500, or an increase of 6.8 percent. </p></blockquote>
<p>  Although construction was still strong statewide, San Diego, the first major area to see a housing slowdown, saw construction layoffs: <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/business/20051022-9999-1b22jobs.html">Construction layoffs could signal trend</a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;There might be some seasonal reasons for the construction losses, but the decline could be a sign that our overall employment growth is slowing,&#8221; said Alan Gin, economist at the University of San Diego. </p>
<p>Gin said the construction layoffs are one more sign that the housing boom, which has created jobs for builders, mortgage brokers and real estate agents, is winding down. </p>
<p>&#8220;The number of home sales is down, price appreciation on most homes is not as great as it used to be, and it&#8217;s taking longer to sell homes,&#8221; Gin said. &#8220;That could mean less growth in construction work.&#8221; </p>
<p>There were signs of trouble in other employment sectors as well. </p>
<p>Financial services cut 200 jobs last month, largely related to real estate and mortgage operations.</p></blockquote>
<p>  A few hundred jobs is somewhat insignificant, except it might indicate a trend change.</p>

                                <p>Since I have been on a bit of a tirade per this issue as to whether <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/kudlow-malpass-tamny-definition-of.html">real wealth</a> has been rapidly increasing, let me recommend a graph from <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2005/09/real_net_househ.html">Michael Mandel</a> who writes:<br />
<blockquote>I like to keep track of what I call &#8220;real net household wealth&#8221;. That is, household net worth, subtracting out federal government debt, and adjusting for inflation. In effect, this measure assumes that households will have to eventually pay back all of the debt, and it accounts for debt owned to foreigners as well. And guess what? This measure hit a new high of $45.3 trillion in second quarter, up 7% over a year earlier, and significantly higher than the boom peak of $44.4 trillion. </p></blockquote>
<p>This 2% increase since the end of 1999 should be compared to the nearly 5.5% increase in population.  In other words, real per capita wealth is still below where it was 5.5 years ago.</p>

                                <p>I’m saddened to see that <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/bartlett200510130903.asp">Bruce Bartlett</a> has taken the low road:<br />
<blockquote>Apparently, this involves publishing articles by its editorial writers that are not good enough to appear in the print edition of the paper. The first of these articles appeared on October 4 and dealt with taxation. It was written by Times editorial board member Teresa Tritch, who writes most of the paper’s economic editorials. Tritch lists her qualifications as having degrees in German and journalism, as well as years of writing about personal finance for Money magazine where she explained why people should shop around for the lowest price before buying soap and things of that sort. What really qualifies Tritch to lecture the rest of us about tax policy is her absolute conviction that our tax system is tilted too much in favor of the rich. </p></blockquote>
<p>I guess the National Review had to get Bruce to write this attack line as had it come from Luskin or Kudlow, we’d all be asking what makes them qualified to write on economics.  As far as the issue of whether the tax system being tilted to favor the rich or not, I would have hoped for a more balanced discussion from Bruce on this topic.  But alas, I should remember that had he presented a more balanced discussion, Rich Lowry would not have published it.  Then again, I prefer Paul Krugman’s op-ed over those from Ms. Tritch or the vast majority of the things published at the National Review.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/10/are_savings_ove.html">Tyler Cowen</a> poses the latest from <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2005/09/why_savings_is.html">Michael Mandel</a> as a question to his class as well as to the rest of us:</p>
<blockquote><p>So what would be the payoff from all that thriftiness? A reasonable rate of return on investment, after depreciation, is roughly 7%. So $1.5 trillion in extra assets would have a return of about $100 billion a year. That $100 billion is roughly 1% of an $11 trillion economy. Over ten years, then, complete elimination of the trade deficit might&#8211;might&#8211;have added a tenth of a percentage point to growth. That&#8217;s a good measure of the size of the virtues of savings&#8211;roughly a tenth of a percentage point on growth. That&#8217;s 0.1 percentage points. To put that in perspective, the estimates of long-term productivity growth have risen roughly a full percentage point over the past decade. The effects of technology more than swamp the effects of savings.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Mandel is trying to suggest that <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/09/tip_toe_through.html">Mark Thoma</a> and others are wrong when they advocate more savings, let me suggest that Mandel is confused.  The old (1956) Solow model of growth consider savings (and capital accumulation) and technological progress as independent determinants of growth.  More recent models of growth note that embodiment of new technology occurs with new machines &#8211; so investment and technological progress are complements.  But Mandel concedes this and poses the question &#8211; why not borrow rather than save.</p>
<p>Keynes noted that the decision to save and the decision to invest for individuals are separate decisions.  However, world investment is constrained by world savings.  We can imagine a two-country model where one nation (let&#8217;s call it the United States) invests, while the other country (let&#8217;s call it China) saves.  The fact that the first nation has to pay the second nation interest on its borrowings means the second nation gets some of the benefits from this investment.  But let&#8217;s at the facts.  China&#8217;s investment/GDP ratio is higher than our investment/GDP ratio.  In fact, our net investment is almost solely financed from borrowing.  So the facts show that U.S. is contributing very little to the world pool of savings.</p>
