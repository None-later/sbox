                                <p>Would you like compare wages for comparable jobs in the U.S. and Mexico? Suppose you wanted to compare factory worker salaries in the two countries. Would you like to then compare how long each factory worker has to work to buy, say, a snicker bar? The list of jobs is quite extensive&#8230;as is the list of things to buy. If you want to put some real flesh and bones on NAFTA, <a href="http://www.ueinternational.org/shop/index.php"><i>Shop &#8217;til You Drop</i> </a>is the site for you.</p>
<p>Of course, I need not tell you that Mexico enjoys a handsome trade surplus with the U.S. But, alas, Mexico is now being hard pressed by China. After China, there is India; after India, there is Vietnam; after Vietnam, there is Colombia. Have no fear, for every one job we lose, two jobs are created here.</p>
<p>After all, we should consider <a href="http://www.nber.org~/~wei/data/rajan&#038;wei2004/rajan&#038;wei2004.pdf">that</a><br />
<blockquote>the amount of &#8216;insourcing&#8217;, that is, the value of business services exported by a country like the US. Clearly, this is considerable &#8211; think of all the high-priced business consultants and lawyers in rich countries offering their services to the rest of the world.</p></blockquote>

                                <h2>Surprising insights from the social sciences
</p>
</h2>
<p> By Kevin Lewis
</p>
<p>April 6, 2008
</p>
<p>Do conservative values and conservative economics go hand in hand? A sociologist looked at broad surveys of Americans to find out whether conservative Protestants &#8211; the 25 percent of the population belonging to churches that emphasize a literal reading of the Bible, personal conversion, and social activism &#8211; accumulated more wealth than other people. The data indicated that conservative Protestants actually accumulated less wealth during their lives; their estimated median net worth was less than half of what it was for the general population. Conservative Protestants do give more of their income to church, but they are also less likely to pursue higher education, they are more likely to have earlier and bigger families, and women are less likely to work. It may be that religious differences can explain a significant portion of economic inequality in the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">United States</place></country-region>, the author says.

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This post contains clips from two articles on gasoline prices.</p>
<p>First up, this <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080408/oil_prices.html">AP News story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Retail gasoline prices pulled back slightly from record levels Tuesday and gave some consumers a small break, but a new government forecast said gas could reach as high as $4 a gallon during the summer driving season.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/28/politics/main646142.shtml">Second is this</a> from CBS back in 2004:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Bush was critical of Al Gore in the 2000 campaign for being part of “the administration that&#8217;s been in charge” while the “price of gasoline has gone steadily upward.” In December 1999, in the first Republican primary debate, Mr. Bush said President Clinton “must jawbone OPEC members to lower prices.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I am sympathetic to the argument that there is a limit to how much a president can do about gasoline prices.  But this is a man who criticized the previous administration for not preventing gasoline prices from rising, so there&#8217;s nothing wrong with pointing out that they have continued to rise on his watch, and if he thought Clinton could do something about it in 1999 and 2000, why hasn&#8217;t he done anything about it since?</p>
<p>And there are a few things he can do.  For instance, if you can&#8217;t do anything about supply, the president&#8217;s bully pulpit can be used to push down demand by encouraging conservation or pushing for higher fuel standards.  </p>
<p>But all of this points to another issue we come back to a lot around here &#8211; what has GW done?  What has he been successful at, even by his own standards? </p>

                                <p>I went a bit ballistic <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/republican-economist-mendacity-about.html">yesterday</a> when I read some spin from <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120761416279896669.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">Cogan&#038;Hubbard</a>.  It seems that <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/237/more-false-budget-comparisons">Andrew Samwick</a> &#8211; who has joined the Capital Gains and Games gang objected as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>How might such a change in taxes have been avoided?  Perhaps by not ramming through such budget-busting tax cuts in the first place.  Perhaps by not letting them persist for so long, running up deficits during business cycle peaks in the intervening years.  Until Hubbard and Cogan are willing to commit to a responsible budget policy, of which tax policy is one component, it is impossible to take an op-ed like this seriously … Note that the 18.8% includes the Social Security surplus.  So according to Hubbard and Cogan, that money is available to be spent on current government expenditures, rather than used to repurchase government debt, which would make the Social Security Trust Fund a legitimate savings vehicle. (Yes, this is the same Cogan who laments that Trust Fund accounting doesn&#8217;t work because the government just spends the money.  I wonder whose op-eds they use to justify their reckless behavior.) … Returning to my point about a responsible budget, not only should the budget be balanced over the business cycle, it must be the on-budget parts (i.e., excluding the Social Security surplus) that must be in balance.  Not only must there be no trend in the debt/GDP ratio, it must be the ratio of total debt (i.e., including the Social Security Trust Fund) to GDP.</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrew’s colleague <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/pete-davis/238/even-more-false-budget-comparisons">Pete Davis</a> also weighs in:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Glenn Hubbard&#8217;s and John Cogan&#8217;s Wall Street Journal op-ed this morning seems persuasive until you consider that their premise is wrong, their math is misleading, and they fail to explain the real reason federal revenues have risen as a share of gross domestic product over the past 25 years … Hubbard and Cogan examine only the past 25 years, starting in fiscal year 1983, when President Reagan&#8217;s tax cuts first took full effect, driving federal revenues down to 17.5% of GDP from 19.6% when he took office in 1981 … Hubbard&#8217;s and Cogan&#8217;s math is very misleading. They state: &#8220;By historical standards, federal revenues relative to GDP, at 18.8% last year, are high. In the past 25 years, this level was only exceeded during the five years from 1996 to 2000.&#8221; It&#8217;s Freudian that they left out the 19.8% of fiscal year 2001, the sixth year in the past 25 over 18.8% … More problematic is that federal revenues over the past 25 years averaged 18.3%, only half a percentage point of GDP below last year&#8217;s 18.8%. Therefore, last year&#8217;s 18.8% is not very high. High is when we hit 20.0% in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 and 20.9% in fiscal year 2000. They fail to note that President Reagan never got revenues below 17.4% of GDP or that President Bush 43 slashed them to 16.5% of GDP in fiscal year 2003 and to 16.4% in fiscal year 2004. President Bush 43 outdid President Reagan by a lot. They also fail to mention that we are headed back down from 18.8% last year to near 18.0% this year. It would be much more accurate to conclude that, last year, federal revenues briefly returned to just above their historical average of the past 25 years, and they headed back slightly below that average right now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most excellent!  This one surprised me at first:</p>
<blockquote><p>Finally, Hubbard and Cogan fail to dissect the reason revenues are high. Turn to Historical Table 1.3 on pages 34 and 35 of the President&#8217;s FY09 Budget. Take a close look at the composition of federal revenues. In fiscal year 1983, federal revenues of 17.5% of GDP were composed of individual income taxes of 8.4%, corporate income taxes of 1.1%, Social Security payroll taxes of 6.1%, excise taxes of 1.0%, and other taxes of 0.9%. Flip to the next page and check out fiscal year 2007, when federal revenues of 18.8% of GDP were composed of individual income taxes of 8.5%, corporate income taxes of 2.7%, Social Security payroll taxes of 6.4%, excise taxes of 0.5%, and other taxes of 0.7%. Hubbard and Cogan would have you believe that individual income taxes are behind the increase, but that isn&#8217;t true. They are almost identical at 8.5% in fiscal year 2007 as compared to 8.4% in fiscal year 1983. The largest increase in 25 years by far is from corporations. Despite lower corporate tax rates, corporations are much more profitable now than they were in 1983, and that 1.6% of GDP increase is the main driver of today&#8217;s higher federal revenues as a percentage of GDP. Social Security payroll taxes have inched up 0.3% points of GDP. Federal excise tax revenues have dropped in half by 0.5% of GDP, and other federal taxes have declined 0.2% of GDP. Glenn and John, where is the tax increase?</p></blockquote>
<p>But then I realized that Pete was comparing 1983 and 2007 whereas my graph was looking way back to 1946. Corporate income taxes were indeed only 1.1% of GDP back in 1983 but this ratio was quite a bit higher before 1983.  Pete’s discussion reminds us both that we should look at the composition of Federal revenues as well as its history over time.  </p>
<p>I have to say that the Capital Gains and Games crowd do a very good job when it comes to fiscal policy discussions.  This is a blog that I intend to read more often.</p>

                                <p>Corporate America has gotten a free pass: No prosecutions; just buy the Out-of-Jail Free card. Today&#8217;s article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/washington/09justice.html?pagewanted=1&#038;_r=1&#038;hp&#038;adxnnlx=1207716154-Ke4fO9iVGu3%20Ffq1sjiv0A"> <i>New York Times</i></a> says it all: &#8220;In Justice Shift, Corporate Deals Replace Trials.&#8221;  Such mighty giants as American Express, Merrill Lynch, Bank of New York, Monsanto et al merely have to pay a fine&#8211;which I am sure is often less than the yearly bonus of the CEO&#8211;and to agree to be watched.  <br />
<blockquote>The agreements were once rare, but their use has skyrocketed in the current administration, with 35 deals last year alone by the Justice Department, lawyers who follow the trend said. Banks, financial service companies and auditors have frequently entered into such agreements&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Already, according to Neil Power, &#8220;who leads the bureau’s economics crime unit,&#8221; the FBI<br />
<blockquote>has opened17 inquiries into accusations of corporate fraud in connection with the subprime scandal&#8230;and that number is sure to grow.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>At a Congressional hearing last month, Mr. Ashcroft defended the agreements, saying that they avoided “destroying entire corporations” through criminal indictments. “Prosecutors understand that a corporate indictment can be a corporate death sentence,” he said. “A deferred prosecution can avoid the catastrophic collateral consequences and costs that are associated with corporate conviction.”</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Another day, another load from <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Yjc2ZGUyNGU5YzMzZTI2MzJhMjEzY2U0Y2NiNzI4N2M=">Kudlow</a>.  I needed a break so I took a look:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>And by the way, despite the current slowdown, during the five years of the Iraq war the U.S. economy has performed remarkably well. Real GDP has increased by 16 percent, or 3 percent annually. The unemployment rate has hovered below a historically low 5 percent for quite some time. Nearly 10 million jobs have been created. Household net worth has increased by $20 trillion. Industrial production has expanded by 13.5 percent.  Even home prices, despite the current correction, have increased by 20 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, at this point, whenever I see numbers by Kudlow, my first reaction is to assume they&#8217;re wrong.  You can find data on real GDP  (since that&#8217;s what he wants to use) at the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">BEA</a>.</p>
<p>I challenge you to show that real GDP increased by 16 percent &#8220;during the five years of the Iraq war.&#8221;  As I do the numbers, from 2003 to 2007, the economy grew by 12.29%, or 2.9% a year.  Maybe he meant 2002?  Then, the economy grew by 15.1%, or 2.85% a year.  2001?  16.9%, and 2.6% a year. </p>
<p>Where Kudlow pulled this from I&#8217;ll probably never know.  But moving on&#8230; let&#8217;s assume he meant 2003 to 2007&#8230; that 2.9% is sufficiently close to his &#8220;3 percent annually.&#8221;  So let&#8217;s go with that.  Now, Kudlow calls that performing remarkably well.  The BEA provides data on real GDP from 1929 to 2007, the last year for which there is data.  So&#8230; its a simple matter to look at how many five year periods ending between between 1933 and 2000 (i.e., before GW took office) performed at least as well as this last five year period.</p>
<p>By my count, 43 times, out of 68 such periods.  In other words, 63% of the time, the economy performed better than &#8220;remarkably well.&#8221;  I would think that would make &#8220;remarkably&#8221; quite a bit less remarkable to most people.  Not to Kudlow, though.</p>
<p>Moving on:  &#8220;Nearly 10 million jobs have been created.&#8221;  Apparently, by nearly, he means &#8220;off by quite a bit.&#8221;  In March, 2003, the <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CE16OV/downloaddata?cid=12">civilian employment</a> was at 137,434,000.  In March of &#8217;08, it was 145,969,00.  Where I sit, that&#8217;s 8.535 million jobs created, but then I don&#8217;t make what Kudlow makes. </p>
<p>But let&#8217;s unpack that number a bit, those 8.535 million jobs created over 61 months.  Is that big?  Is it small?  Who knows?  It lacks context.  That said, given that Kudlow mentions job creation as if its impressive, I think its safe to assume its actually a small number.  </p>
<p>Operating under that assumption, let&#8217;s look at a different 61 month long period.    Right now the <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/08s0003.xls">US population exceeds 300 million</a>.   In 1968, the <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/08s0002.xls">US population first cracked 200 million people</a>.   It turns out that the 61 month period ending in December of 1968 &#8211; almost thirty years ago, with the population about a third smaller than it is now, 8.565 million jobs were created.  That&#8217;s right&#8230;  GW&#8217;s impressive period produced less jobs than a similar period when LBJ was still President.  Not so impressive in that context, is it? </p>
<p>I can go on, but why bother?  Nobody cares.  People who believe Kudlow will continue to believe him, regardless of what happens. I gotta get back to work.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Correction &#8211; I had the wrong figures for March 03 employment when first published. Thanks to vtcodger for pointing it out.</p>
<p>Addition &#8211; in comments, Ken Houghton shows how Kudlow got a 16% growth rate:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;since the war started in late q1 of 2003, if you count from q4 of 2002 to q4 of 2007 (five years), in chained values, the increase is 15.65%, which is 16% if you&#8217;re a television economist without an economics degree.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>This article in the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Private Equity Law Review</a> indicates that unravelling the 45 Trillion could be interesting.</p>
<blockquote><p>Judge Christopher A. Boyko&#8217;s order dismissing a number of foreclosure actions brought by a CDO trustee throws a hard light on a common practice in real estate loan syndication.  Due to the cost of  properly assigning the notes and mortgages that get tossed into the CDO trust, the assignments are not actually completed.  Instead, documents are signed expressing an &#8220;intent&#8221; to assign.  A spokesman for Deutsche Bank, the CDO trustee, said that skipping the assignment process :</p>
<p>&#8220;[Is] typically done as a matter of cost efficiency, since for some extremely high percentage of mortgages there will never be any foreclosure activity, there&#8217;s no legal need for the assignments to be recorded until they need to be used.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Because the assignments were not completed at the time the foreclosure actions were filed, Judge Boyko ruled that the CDO trustee lacked standing to bring the action.  A dismissal on these grounds is not based on the merits, and the trustee is free to refile the action once it completes the assignment paperwork.</p>
<p>Assuming, of course, that paperwork exists and can be found.  The paperwork underlying a large CDO is massive.  The notes and mortgages on which the CDO is based are originated in broker&#8217;s and lawyer&#8217;s offices around the country, and a book entry is made somewhere reflecting the loan.  That book entry is what is placed in the CDO trust, not the note and mortgage itself.  </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank tried the compelling argument that “‘Judge, you just don’t understand how things work.’”  That didn&#8217;t go down well with Judge Boyko, who wrote that this attitude “reveals a condescending mindset and quasi-monopolistic system where financial institutions have traditionally controlled, and still control, the foreclosure process.” </p>
<p>The balance of power in the foreclosure process may tip toward plaintiff&#8217;s attorneys if other courts begin demanding proper documentation of syndicated loans.</p></blockquote>

<p>Via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/04/looming-tax-hike.html">Greg Mankiw</a> comes a bit of fiscal mendacity from <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120761416279896669.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">John Cogan and Glenn Hubbard</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the presidential campaign enters its final stages, there will be increased debate over budget priorities and how they will be paid for. Many commentators and political leaders, including Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, believe that tax increases are needed to restore near-term budget balance and finance longer-term entitlement growth.  These claims fail budget arithmetic and economics. Worse, they raise serious questions about the nation&#8217;s broad fiscal policies and its commitment to economic growth.  By historical standards, federal revenues relative to GDP, at 18.8% last year, are high. In the past 25 years, this level was only exceeded during the five years from 1996 to 2000. Still, we stand on the verge of a very large tax increase, one that will occur unless the next Congress and president agree to rescind it. Letting the Bush tax cuts expire will drive the personal income tax burden up by 25% – to its highest point relative to GDP in history.  This would be the largest increase in personal income taxes since World War II. It would be more than twice as large as President Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s surcharge to finance the war in Vietnam and the war on poverty. It would be more than twice the combined personal income tax increases under Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton. The increase would push total federal government revenues relative to GDP to 20% &#8230; Proponents of bigger government invariably argue that allowing all or some of President Bush&#8217;s tax cuts to expire is necessary in the near term to balance the federal budget, and necessary in the longer term to finance the retirement and health-care promises made to the baby-boom generation. But a tax increase is neither wise nor necessary.  As has so often been true in the past, the economic damage caused by the tax increases and tax avoidance behavior will prevent the promised revenues from being realized. At the same time, the promise of higher revenues will encourage Congress to continue its profligate spending. As a result, a tax increase won&#8217;t lower the budget deficit.  Moreover, current tax rates can be maintained and even reduced and still allow for necessary increases in national security appropriations and the balancing of the federal budget. Although budget balance may not be achieved overnight, a firm commitment by the next president to spending control will enable balance by the end of his or her first term.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m calling this mendacity for several reasons.  Cogan and Hubbard fail to inform their readers that the current tax rates are leaving us with a massive General Fund deficit, which means we have substantial deferred tax liabilities not showing up in the current tax figures.  As they claim we can balance the budget and still have large defense spending, they are failing to tell their readers that the only way this works out in the long-run is to have the Social Security Trust Fund subsidize the General Fund.  Translation for the average Joe: expect to continue to pay those high payroll contributions as you watch your Social Security benefits slashed.</p>
<p>But my main – and a somewhat new – complaint about this GOP spin is how Cogan and Hubbard highlight a subset of income taxes.  Our graph shows not only the personal income tax to GDP ratio they focus on but also total Federal income taxes as a share of GDP with the difference being mainly profits taxes.  Federal income taxes were around 13% of GDP in 1981 but then declined to less than 11% as a result of the Reagan tax cuts.  Of course, the Reagan years were a period of deferred taxation as well.  The Clinton years saw a restoration of fiscal responsibility by getting Federal income taxes to once again reach 13% of GDP. While Cogan and Hubbard are correct to note that personal income taxes as a share of GDP were high by historical standards during the late 1990’s, they fail to tell the reader that profit taxes as a share of GDP had declined over the years.  What do I draw from looking at this data?  The reason that personal income taxes as a share of GDP had to increase was NOT that Federal spending had increased but because there was a shift away from taxing capital and towards taxing labor.  But Cogan and Hubbard try to paint a very different picture by giving only a portion of the overall tax story.  I hate to say this about Glenn Hubbard – but he has lent his name to what appears to be a very dishonest message.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/viewpoints/stories/DN-hutchison_07edi.ART.State.Edition1.4646c20.html">Kay Baily Hutchison</a> gets downright silly in her call to make the tax cuts permanent:</p>
<blockquote><p>But in 2010, those tax cuts, which spurred growth and created 8.1 million jobs, are set to expire. If they are allowed to expire, we will witness the largest tax increase in American history.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://frontburner.dmagazine.com/2008/04/07/tax-cuts-the-new-religion">Wick Allison</a> responds:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, dear Kay, “tax-and-spend” is preferable to the borrow-and-spend philosophy of the current GOP administration, which has created the highest deficits and the largest increases to the national debt in our history. Second, if the Bush tax cuts are responsible for the economy’s job creation, why did the Clinton-era tax increases result in even more jobs? Third, besides opposing a redesign of the Bush tax cuts, what exactly do you, as a United States Senator, propose to do to restore fiscal sanity to a federal government whose spending has run amok during your last seven years in office? Really, this has gotten to be too much. This is a party — my GOP — that wouldn’t even raise taxes to pay for a war. It is locked in an ideological mind-set whose chief attribute is recklessness. It stands against everything that conservatism once stood for: pragmatism, prudence, and the idea of safeguarding our country’s patrimony to future generations. (And, beloved Senator, what have you done today about Medicare and Social Security, besides, of course, voting to expand its costs?)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://www.capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/235/weeks-fiscal-fitness">Stan Collender </a> must have anticipated the Cogan-Hubbard spin when he wrote his “fiscal fitness” post.  Read the whole thing but here’s the Cliff Notes version:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are two current budget arguments I personally find most distressing.  The first is that current or proposed levels of federal spending and revenues are somehow inappropriate, unjustified or unpatriotic because they deviate from the historical average &#8230; The second most misleading and depressing argument used these days is that the budget problem is only a spending problem.</p></blockquote>
