<p> Romney and Private Equity&#8217;s Questionable Schemes for Paying Very Little Tax</p>
<p> Presumably any American who wants to be informed is aware that GOP presidential candidate <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/08/-private-equity-magic-trick-equity-managers-gain-taxpayers-losses-reich-video.html">Mitt Romney</a>&#8216;s claim to business acumen resides in his experience at a <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/08/-private-equity-magic-trick-equity-managers-gain-taxpayers-losses-reich-video.html">private equity firm</a> that made much of its money by ramping up debt at purchased firms and using that debt to repay whatever (usually relatively small) investment the equity firm partners made in what has come to be known as &#8220;LBO&#8221; deals (for &#8220;leveraged buyout&#8221;).  In LBOs, the equity firm investors almost always do well to exceedingly well, using mostly other people&#8217;s money. </p>
<p>Not so generally for the workers in the bought-out company.  The &#8220;rent&#8221; profits of the equity firm are often on the back of the workers, who may get fired in favor of outsourcing their jobs or get stuck in a rut, as productivity gains go to the new managers and owners and not to the workers.  At the least, the high debt load makes it very difficult for the company to succeed and certainly difficult for it to give its workers a fair shake.   Remember that one of Romney&#8217;s gaffs was to admit that he enjoys firing workers.<br />Why anybody thinks this kind of winner-take-all, leverage-&#8217;em-up mentality of private equity firms suggests the kind of leader desirable for a democracy that purports to provide genuine opportunity for all classes of citizens to live a decent life is beyond me. </p>
<p>But even if the very nature of the business and the common tools of over-leverage and &#8220;rent&#8221; profits for a very few already at the top don&#8217;t give voters cause for pause, then there are the many ways that private equity firm partners manage to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, which ensures that more of the tax burden falls on the less-well-off, that are worthy of consideration, even if candidate Romney has not (as his campaign claims) benefited from them personally.  That is because if Romney is elected president, his views on the acceptability of aggressive tax strategies of questionable legality will matter.  We should know what kinds of tax schemes are routine in the business that he touts as good evidence of his ability to serve as president of this nation&#8211;especially if some of them are obviously poor policy (the carried interest treatment) or highly questionable tax avoidance schemes (the management fee conversion waiver scheme).</p>
<p>1. Carried Interest   (More after the jump)</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The best known way private equity firm partners reduce taxes is by earning their compensation in the form of &#8220;carried interest&#8221; and claiming that such profits should be treated the same way a real capital investment in a partnership is treated, even though it is awarded as compensation for their purported management expertise and work and not as a return on an actual investment made.   That is, they claim they are profits partners in the firm and that their compensation is a distribution of the partnership&#8217;s profits (usually from gains on sales, and hence eligible for preferential capital gains) to them rather than compensation income.  As such they benefit from the extraordinarily preferential rate for capital gains in the current law as enacted under the Bush administration (generally 15%).  Carried interest is the primary reason that candidate Romney has to pay such a very low rate of taxes on his income from his business.</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Code (the codification of the federal statutes governing the federal income tax) does not include a specific provision governing profits interests and indicating that such &#8220;profits&#8221; partners should be treated as actual partners in a partnership (without that partnership interest itself being subject to tax as compensation) entitled to receive capital gains distributions.  Accordingly, as one partnership tax treatise puts it, the tax treatment of a transfer to a &#8220;service partner&#8221; of a &#8220;profits interest&#8221; for services &#8220;has been uncertain&#8221; because &#8220;[n]o provision of the Code specifically exempts from taxation the receipt of any partnership interest in exchange for services.&#8221;  Willis &#038; Postlewaite, Partnership Taxation, 6th ed, at 4-124.    There is some case law about profits interests, but those cases made it even less clear how and when such interests should be taxed. </p>
<p>Finally, the Service resolved the issue with administrative authority (heavily lobbied for in the interests of equity partners and real estate profit partners, in particular) in Rev. Proc. 93-27 (and later proposed regs and other items) that does not treat the issuance of a compensatory &#8220;profits interest&#8221; as  a taxable event in most instances.  The main reason for the treatment may well be the so-called &#8220;Wall Street Rule&#8221;&#8211;once incredibly wealthy taxpayers hire sophisticated, high-priced lawyers to produce opinons supportive of a taxpayer-favorable interpretation and then operate as though the Code blesses a particular activity, it is hard for tax administrators to issue regulatory authority that treats that activity differently.</p>
<p>2, Management Fee Conversion Waivers<br />But there is another lesser-known aspect to the compensation that private equity fund partners earn for their services in their private equity firms&#8211;the management fee.  Most explanations describe this as  compensation paid for services that is subject to taxation at the ordinary rate (just like a secretary&#8217;s wages would be).  But that disregards a practice that exists among a significant number of equity firms (the Times article linked below says about 40% in 2009) that are willing to take aggressive positions to avoid paying taxes and can afford to pay the tax professionals to provide a way to do it&#8211;the management fee waiver conversion scheme. </p>
<p>The conversion of management fees from ordinary income to capital gains is purportedly accomplished by &#8220;waiving&#8221; the fees (not necessarily across-the-board throughout the life of the firm, but often selectively and on a quarter-by-quarter basis),  Instead of getting fees, the partner claims they are &#8220;converted&#8221; to a share of related profits &#8211;i.e., they become an additional carried interest&#8211;and hence eligible for treatment as (deferred) capital gains from the firm.  </p>
<p>Some tax professionals think this conversion waiver works.  Much of this is again the &#8220;Wall Street Rule&#8221;&#8211;the claim that lots do it, the IRS has known about it, and oh it should be justifiable because now the &#8220;fee&#8221; is (sort of, maybe, kinda) at risk.  It is not really at risk in the way we ordinarily think of investment risk, since these are pre-tax dollars &#8212; the managers are not putting after-tax dollars at risk like any other investor is doing.  And as Vic Fleischer commented to the Gothamist blog, &#8220;there is a tension between economic risk and tax risk &#8230;. The way Bain set it up there&#8217;s not much risk at all, so it&#8217;s hard to see how this income should receive capital gains treatment.&#8221;  Christopher Robbins, <a href="http://gothamist.com/2012/09/02/ny_ag_bain_capital_others_may_have.php">NY AG: Bain Capital and others may have skirted tax law</a>, the Gothamist (Sept. 2, 2012).  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d guess  that most professionals do not think the conversion scheme works, at least not in most instances.  This would be especially true for those who consider that interpretations of the law should further coherent bodies of law that work as fairly as possible.  And even more tax professionals likely think that the partnership rules should be adjusted to ensure that it doesn&#8217;t work, since otherwise we are perpetuating inequities in the tax system that favor the already incredibly rich.</p>
<p>The conversion waiver issue has come to the attention of the public now because the New York State attorney general is investigating private equity firms who may have engaged in this conversion waiver practice.  See Nichnolas Confessore et al, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/business/inquiry-on-tax-strategy-adds-to-scrutiny-of-finance-firms.html">Inquiry on Tax Strategy Adds to Scrutiny of Finance Firms</a>, New York Times (Sept. 1, 2012) (noting that the AG&#8217;s subpoenas, issued by the AG&#8217;s Taxpayer Protection Bureau, cover firms like Kohlberg Kravis, TPG Capital, Apollo Global, Silver Lake and Bain, and that Bain partners may have saved more than $200 million in federal income taxes, $20 million in Medicare taxes). <br />It&#8217;s not clear on what grounds the New York AG is investigating this issue, which appears on the surface to be primarily a federal income tax issue.  It could be some sort of state-law fraud claim but it could also be a claim that underpayment of state taxes routinely results from the filing posture taken,  Equity partners in firms using the conversion waiver would presumably be able to save on state income taxes through either rate preferences and/or deferral, depending on the state and how much the state&#8217;s laws build on the federal filing.  Though New York State does not have a preferential rate for capital gains, if the timing of reporting the income is set by the conversion waiver, the deferral would amount to a significant state tax savings that deprives New York of needed revenues. </p>
<p>[<em>Aside:  By the way, some of the information about the management fee conversion waiver first came to broad public attention in connection with Bain and the trove of documents released at Gawker.com.  See John Cook, <a href="http://gawker.com/5936394">The Bain Files: Inside Mitt Romney&#8217;s Tax-Dodging Cayman Schemes</a>, Gawker.com (Aug. 23, 2012) (noting that the huge cache of Bain financial documents &#8220;shed a great deal of light on those finances, and on the tax-dodging tricks available to the hyper-rich that [Romney] has used to keep his effective tax rate at roughly 13% over the last decade&#8221;).   These documents, and the further analysis articles available at the Gawker.com site, are worth considering for their own revelation of what Romney&#8217;s real business is like and how that does (or doesn&#8217;t) suggest he can help our economy as president&#8211;it is a business where &#8220;opaque complexity&#8221; allows the &#8220;preposterously wealthy&#8221; to engage in &#8220;exotic tax-avoidance schemes&#8221;, according to the Gawker.com article.  (I have not yet personally perused much of the 950 page trove on Gawker.)  That said, Romney&#8217;s campaign issued a statement indicating that the candidate has not benefited from the conversion waiver practice.  We have not, of course, seen enough of Romney&#8217;s tax returns and supporting information to be able to judge this matter independently.  The focus on the conversion waiver thus provides yet another reason why candidate Romney should release 10 years of tax returns as other candidates have done</em>.]</p>
<p>There are two additional readable pieces on this conversion waiver issue, plus a scholarly article that anyone wanting to better understand the details can peruse.  Vic Fleischer, a tax prof at Colorado who made his original contribution to academe by writing about carried interest, has an article that sets out the issues well, with an example contrasting the significant difference in after-tax results for a real investor compared to a profits-interest purported investor.  See Victor Fleischer,<a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/whats-at-issue-in-the-private-equity-tax-inquiry/?nl=business&#038;emc=edit_dlbkpm_20120904">What&#8217;s at issue in the private equity tax inquiry</a>, DealBook, New York Times (Sept. 4, 2012). See also Brian Beutler, <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/did-bain-capital-execs-break-the-law-using-a-common-tax-avoidance-strategy.php">Did Bain Capital Execs Break the Law Using a Common Tax Avoidance Strategy? </a>Talkingpointsmemo.com (Sept. 3, 2012). The academic piece is Gregg Polsky, <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1295443">Private Equity Management Fee Conversions </a>(Nov. 4, 2008).  The following two paragraphs are from the conclusion to that piece.</p>
<p>In fact, there are strong arguments that it is not. While managers argue that the safe harbor in Rev. Proc. 93-27 applies to the additional carried interest, there are both technical and conceptual claims to the contrary. Without the protection afforded by Rev. Proc. 93-27, the additional carried interest would be taxable upon receipt if it has a market value capable of determination. Both the context in which the additional carried interest is issued and the specific design features of the typical additional carried interest support the view that additional carried interests are significantly easier to value than prototypical profits interests.Under existing case law, this would mean that the additional carried interest is taxable upon receipt as ordinary income to the extent of its fair market value.</p>
<p>The IRS also has strong arguments under section 707(a)(2)(A), which recasts transactions that are artificially designed as partnership transactions in order to obtain tax benefits, such as character conversion. In the context of fee conversions, the most critical fact that favors section 707(a)(2)(A) re-characterization is the manager’s very limited exposure to risk. As a result, section 707(a)(2)(A) likely applies to fee conversions. If so, the manager’s attempt to convert the character of their management fee income would be thwarted.<br />

<p>Payroll Employment by Presidential Administrations</p>
<p>Ryan is saying that Obama&#8217;s record is like Jimmy Carter&#8217;s record.</p>
<p>When it comes to employment we should hope so.</p>
<p>During Carter&#8217;s four years in office payroll employment expanded some 10 million,<br />or 12.5%.  or at an average annual rate of 3.1%   This is the second best employment record of<br />any post WW II Presidential administration.  It is almost a full percentage point stronger than<br />Reagan&#8217;s average gain of 2.2%.</p>

<p>I would think the better comparison would be against Bush  where over eight years payroll employment only expanded some 308,000.   Interestingly, in three and a half years under Obama payroll employment  has expanded more that it did over eight years under Bush.</p>

<p>You would think that someone in the press would call the Republicans on their claims.</p>
<p>In modern times every Democratic presidential administration left office with a lower unemployment rate than when they took office.  But only one Republican Administration has managed this accomplishment.</p>

                                <p>by <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a></p>
<p>Policy transmission mechanism: Broken in Italy, better in Spain<br />Yesterday, <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/60ae47cc-f5e5-11e1-a6c2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz25VANEnVy">the Financial Times </a>reported that borrowing costs for small businesses in the periphery were rising relative to the core using the ECB’s release of July MFI interest rate data. <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/2012/08/01/evidence-on-clogged-transmission-channel-of-monetary-policy-in-the-euro-area/">I highlighted this point exactly on August 1</a> following Draghi’s now famous London speech, where he cautioned that monetary transmission mechanism is ‘hampered’.</p>
<p>As opposed to the FT, though, I would argue that the transmission mechanism is at least not getting worse in Spain and Portugal, and worsening in Italy. Italy is the only periphery economy (where data is made available) where the corporate borrowing costs are higher since the peak of corporate lending rates in the Euro area in July 2011.</p>
<p>The FT is wrong. It takes Spain as the case study and uses the incorrect corporate lending rate information. Specifically, <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/60ae47cc-f5e5-11e1-a6c2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz25VANEnVy">according to the FT</a> (bolded by RW):<br />
<blockquote><em>The interest rate charged by banks on a<strong> corporate loan of up to €1m lasting between one and five years – which would typically be taken out by a small business</strong> – was 6.5 per cent in July in Spain, according to the ECB figures.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>True, the rate on new business loans up to and including €1 mn with maturity of 1-5 years did see an average <a href="http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?SERIES_KEY=124.MIR.M.ES.B.A2A.I.R.0.2240.EUR.N">borrowing rate of 6.5%</a> in July. However, corporate loans up to and including €1 mn with maturity of greater than 5 years saw a <a href="http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?SERIES_KEY=124.MIR.M.ES.B.A2A.J.R.0.2240.EUR.N">drop in borrowing costs of 1.4% in July to 5.17%</a> . The 5.17% rate is the rate that should be quoted, rather than the 6.5% rate.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The 2012 Euro area stock of outstanding debt shows clearly that 57% of corporate loans had been made with maturity of greater than 5 years – the ECB provides no breakdown of loan data by maturity at the country level, so the FT must have been referring to the ECB’s Euro area data as the ‘typical loan’.<br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/stock_loans.jpg"><img alt="" height="291" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/stock_loans.jpg" width="483"></a><br />As demonstrated in the chart below, the story is much more complicated than the FT curtly portrays – it’s not just ‘Spain’ versus ‘Germany’. French corporate borrowing costs barely budged since July 2011. Furthermore, the corporate borrowing rates in Spain are improving rather materially compared to those in Italy and Portugal.<br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/nfc_rate_bar.jpg"><img alt="" height="379" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/nfc_rate_bar.jpg" width="476"></a><br />Italian corporate borrowing are up 0.67% since the peak of EA corporate lending rates in July 2011 (the <a href="http://www.ecb.int/stats/monetary/rates/html/index.en.html">ECB hiked its policy rate on July 13</a>). Spanish corporates, on the other hand, saw corporate borrowing costs fall the most of all the periphery economies, -1.35% since July 2011.<br />As demonstrated in the illustration below, the core is benefiting largely from ECB rate cuts compared to the periphery (chart 1 below). However, on a 3-month moving average (the rates moves are pretty choppy in Spain), the transmission mechanism in Spain is improving relative to that Italy and Portugal (chart 2 below). Using the correct data, the FT should have included this information in their article.<br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/time_series_1.jpg"><img alt="" height="338" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/time_series_1.jpg" width="507"></a><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/time_series_2.jpg"><img alt="" height="338" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/time_series_2.jpg" width="507"></a><br /><em><strong>Rebecca Wilder</strong></em><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/2012/09/04/policy-transmission-mechanism-broken-in-italy-better-in-spain">The Wilder View&#8230;Economonitors</a></p>

<p> The Matrix: The Intersection of War, Economic Theory, and the Economy</p>
<p> Vincent Portillo and I are working on a new book, The Matrix: The Intersection of War, Economic Theory, and the Economy.  So far it is still remains an exploration rather than a finished research project.  We intend to post our progress from time to time, hoping to initiate some comments and conversation.</p>

                                <p>
<div><span lang="EN">I&#8217;m feeling lonely out on this limb, but I think I will defend Bernanke and criticize Woodford ((and admit I only read the concluding section and the first two sections on foreward guidance of <a href="http://kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2012/mw.pdf?sm=jh083112-4">his talk)</a> *.pdf but no warning. Open it).  Medium and long term Treasury rates are extraordinarily low.  It seems to me that we can deduce three things from this. 
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">1) Pessimism about real GDP
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN">2) Low expected inflation
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN">3) Bond traders are confident that the Fed will keep the target federal funds rate at essentially zero for a good long while (at least through 2015 <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/monetary-policy-lower-bounds.html">see this</a>)
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Krugman and the league of reality based economists like to stress points 1 and 2, but point 3 is just as solid.  No possible forward guidance can get the 5 year rate under 0. 
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN">The Krugman/Woodford/Eggertsson/(apologies to those I missed) point always was that even if the monetary authority can&#8217;t get the safe short term rate lower, it *might* be able to influence the safe short term rate expected to hold a few years in the future.   But how much lower can that expected rate go?  The 5 year rate was 0.66% the last time I checked.  It is hard to imagine that Bernanke can make credible promises about policy after the end of his current term.  A negative real federal funds rate is very very far from normal (I&#8217;d say normal is about 2 % real). There is every sign that the Fed has given about all the forward guidance to bond traders that can be given. 
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">OK my thoughts on Woodfords thoughts and empirical work on forward guidance.  First I will refer to figures but not cut and paste them (not respect for copyright but laziness). Please click the links.  My only real point is that all of the shifts in interest rates are tiny.  The largest is on the order of 0.15%.  Even if interpreted as a shift in predicted short rates due to a shift in beliefs about the monetary authorities future policy, this just can’t be a big deal.  The results are consistent with important additional benefits from a 15 or maybe a 10 year commitment to extremely low interest rates.  But the current monetary authorities just can’t do that, because they probably won’t be in office.
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div>After the jump I work through the first two sections on monetary guidance.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN"><br /><a name="more"></a></div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">I note that the theory of forward guidance section ends with warnings about how difficult it is to make such a policy work
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>These matters are not simple
</p>
</div>
<div>ones, and require considerable attention to the way the central bank communicates
</p>
</div>
<div>about its objectives, procedures and decisions. The problem is all the more difficultwhen one must communicate about how an unprecedented situation will be dealt with.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">But the part which really bothers me is the discussion of empirical evidence of effects of forward policy guidance.  Section 1.2.1 “Does Central Bank Speech Matter” (which really should be titled “does central Bank Speech other than explicit forward guidance matter”) concludes
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i><span lang="EN">“one cannot say that these results provide clear
</p>
<p></i><i>evidence of an ability to change beliefs about the reaction function.”</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">The next section on explicit forward guidance includes the disclaimer
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i><span lang="EN">“It is therefore of interest to consider what has happened on these occasions, even if one cannot do formal hypothesis tests with such a small sample of events, each rather unique.”</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">I’m not sure I agree.  The number of data points is equal to the number of transactions in financial markets.  Figure 1 seems to show statistically significant evidence of a drop of expected future overnight interest rates of about 10 to 15 whole basis points.  Wow.  This could be expected to have uh not much effect on anything anyone cares about because 15 basis points sure aint a lot. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN"> Woodford is a very smart guy but when he writes </div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<blockquote><p><i><span lang="EN">“It is useful to note not only that OIS rates for maturities as long as six to twelve months fall, but that the longer maturities fall more; that is, not only does the OIS yield curve fall in response to the announcement, but it flattens.”</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">He uses <span lang="EN">bold face type<span lang="EN"> to discuss a difference of 2 or 3 basis points.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">But wait, there’s more.  The 10-15 percent decline at the time of the announcement on April 21 2009 didn’t last
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">“One also observes from Figure 2 that, during the first week of June the forward rate shot up again, to a level greater than 50 basis points (and higher than in the period before the “conditional commitment”).
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">This is evidence presented by someone who concludes that forward guidance is important – that an extraordinary (perhaps unprecedented) announcement managed to get 12 month rates to decline by up to 15 basis points for about 40 days and 40 nights. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Woodford goes on to discuss Fed announcements.   First he notes a decrease of about 10 basis points again. Then he stresses in Figure 4 a decline of around 5 basis points (cheating on the timing one can get it up to around 10 basis points).  Figure 4 has a scale from 5 to 25 basis points.  The legend  includes the note that instead of the 5 year rate, the graph shows the 5 year rate minus 50 basis points.  I can’t make decent figures to save my life, but that’s unusual.  Almost substantively it may be Kosher but is not Kosher for passover to make a tiny change look large by graphing comparable variables on different scales.  Also really Five (<span lang="EN">5<span lang="EN">) basis points. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Woodford also discusses evidence other than event studies and then writes </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i>while market movements during a very short time window around an announcement can reasonably be attributed to news contained in the announcement, developments since 2010 of the kind shown in Figures 5 through 8 might alternatively be attributed simply to market participants’ increasing doubts that conditions would warrant an increase in the funds rate target anytime soon, for reasons unrelated to the FOMC’s statements.</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">In other words nothing much to see in figures 5 through 8.  He does however note that the median blue chip forecaster made a forecast of the duration of extremely low federal funds rate which corresponded to the FOMCs prediction.  That evidence in figure 5 tends to suggest (just using the median as the only summary statistic) very little room for a larger effect on forecasts of policy based on a (cross my heart and hope to die and if I break my word all shall know that I am no gentleman and should feel free to spit on me) promise not a hedged conditional prediction.  The evidence presented in figure 5 has no effect whatsoever on Woodford’s concluding section in which he discusses how the Fed could give more effective forward guidance.  There is so far in the paper at most a few basis points of evidence that Canadian or US forward guidance could possibly be more convincing.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Oh noooo it seems I am disagreeing with Lars Svensson too
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i>In a review of Sweden’s experience, Deputy Governor Lars Svensson (2010) argues that, through December 2008, the Riksbank had been relatively successful at “managing expectations” through its policy.</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">So what about evidence ? Case 1
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i>The result is that an announcement that was intended to shift down the anticipated
</p>
<p></i><i>forward path of rates, by announcing that a low rate would be maintained until</i><i>the beginning of 2011, and so to immediately lower longer-term interest rates, had</i><i>exactly the opposite effect: long rates rose, because the entire anticipated forward path of rates shifted up. </i><i>What went wrong? </i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Figure 10 shows a shift in the wrong direction of roughly a big big 15 basis points.  The average shift in the event studies is no longer around 0.1% but rather more like 0.05%
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Next
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>Svensson (2010) argues instead that survey data on traders’ forecasts of inflation and growth indicate that they were no more optimistic than the Riksbank, and hence that market participants simply did not accept the Riksbank’s forecasts about <i>its own future approach to policy.</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">So now I feel less bad about disagreeing with Svensson too, since Svensson too disputes the claim made by Svensson.  Also Woodford seems to dispute Svensson’s claim
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>If so, it would seem that the attempt to use forward guidance more aggressively after April 2009 has been associated with a loss of market confidence in the informativeness of the Riksbank’s projections. Whether it will return once macroeconomic conditions have normalized remains to be seen.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">But in any case all of the interest rate shifts discussed in the empirical section are so tiny as to matter little. So three out of four have the desired sign.  Wow. 
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">And this in a speech on the importance of forward guidance !  What could a skeptic add ?</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">OK the standard 2 disclaimers.  Woodford also discusses the direct effect of purchases of risky assets on the risk that private investors feel they are bearing so on asset prices and so on the economy.  He advocates the purchase of more MBS.  I absolutely agree with that.</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Also, of course, it is better to light one small candle that curse against the darkness.  If indeed more vigorous efforts to influenc forecasts of future monetary policy will have only a small positive effect, then they definitely should be made.  </div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">A very strange aspect of the discussion is that people who are sure that it would be easy for monetary authorities to get economies back to full employment quickly are de facto allies of people who expect the effects of shifts in monetary policy to be small but of the right sign.  Both agree on what is to be done, so almost no one stresses the huge scientific disagreements.</div>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>
<div>I like <a href="http://truth-out.org/">Truthout</a>.  I’m on its email list and so I receive daily notices about newly posted articles on the site.  I don’t read them all, but the ones I read usually are worth the time.  And I was deeply flattered when, two years ago, on the basis of two lengthy articles I posted here on AB on complicated legal issues, I was invited to blog for them, mainly on legal issues, through a new forum they were at the time planning for a small set of invited bloggers. (The forum never got off the ground, much to my disappointment.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So I suppose that this is, in a sense, a family quarrel.  But earlier today Dan emailed me with a link to a Truthout article and asked my opinion of it, and I obliged.  And hours after I first read the article, I’m still seething enough to repost those comments here.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The article is titled <a href="http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/11264-john-cusack-and-jonathan-turley-on-obamas-constitution"><i>John Cusack Interviews Law Professor Jonathan Turley About Obama Administration’s War On the Constitution</i></a>.  Turley is the Someone and Someone Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington Law School. Good for him.  He’s also the Director of the Environmental Law Advocacy Center there.  And the Executive Director of the Project for Older Prisoners.  <i>Very</i>good for him.  And he’s one of those omnipresent law-prof. presences whose byline is everywhere, or seems to be, and whose quotes also regularly appear in articles under other people’s bylines because, I think, his contact information comes already printed on the Rolodexes of legal-issues journalists when purchased.  This is especially so in recent years, because, as <a href="http://www.law.gwu.edu/Faculty/profile.aspx?id=1738">his GW faculty page</a> says, “[h]e has served as a consultant on homeland security and constitutional issues, and is a frequent witness before the House and Senate on constitutional and statutory issues as well as tort reform legislation.”  <i>Very, very</i> good for him.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It also says, “He also is a nationally recognized legal commentator; he ranked 38th in the top 100 most cited ‘public intellectuals’ in a recent study by Judge Richard Posner and was found to be the second most cited law professor in the country.”  I know. That’s my point.  He’s eminent.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>John Cusack, the article’s actual author and Turley’s interviewer, is, well, a movie star.  Star, being the operative word here.  As it is with Turley himself.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The point of the interview was to elicit Turley’s assertion that it is the obligation of principled liberals to not vote for Obama this time, because of Obama’s stances and actions on Patriot Act and other War on Terror questions and in Afghanistan. Which Cusack did, bracketed and interspersed between Cusack’s own musings on the subject.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hyperventilating after reading the article, I responded to Dan (OK, slightly edited here):
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Wow. I don’t even know where to begin.  I too have been baffled and stunned by the Obama administration’s positions on Patriot Act-related and other War on Terror prisoner civil rights issues. And on some lower-profile civil liberties issues unrelated to war or to Patriot Act matters, too—particularly certain positions as <i>amicus</i> at the Supreme Court, from time to time; cases in which the federal government is not actually a party but in which the Court has asked the Solicitor General’s office to way in anyway, or in which the administration has decided on its own to way in.  And on Afghanistan, well, the situation speaks for itself.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But only liberals like John Cusack and Jonathan Turley—people who can, literally, afford the luxury of putting “principle” above the realities of the effect of Romney/Ryan vs. Obama on so many, many, many <i>other</i> critically important public-policy and legal issues—are anything but <i>insane</i> to engage in the absurd conceit that they are principled in helping elect Romney/Ryan.  Anyone else who takes that &#8220;principled&#8221; stance is crazy.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I know all too well the specifics of the profound harm done by the Federalist Society judges—at <i>all three</i> levels of the federal bench, not just the Supreme Court.  And the courts are only one of so many parts of this.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>There is, truly, almost <i>nothing</i> that makes me angrier than reading this kind of garbage from people who themselves will never actually be directly impacted by the outcome of this election.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Japan’s kamikaze pilots during WWII were principled, too—or at least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_T%C5%8Dj%C5%8D">their prime minister</a> and military commanders were. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>To people of that ilk, I say: Drop dead.  Or vote for Ralph Nader.  And then drop dead.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Romney campaign should have put Cusack on that stage last Thursday instead of Clint Eastwood.
</p>

                                <blockquote><p>…if you read about the tussle between the two great economists, you are struck by two things. First, <strong>how pragmatic a man John Maynard Keynes was</strong>. And second, <strong>how utopian the ideals of Friedrich Hayek are</strong>. This is odd, as each man attached himself to a polar opposite political philosophy: Keynes’s ideas were adopted by idealistic lefties, while Hayek’s thoughts were lapped up by conservatism, a philosophy that by definition rejects dogma. <strong>It is as if we have gone through the looking glass.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who could have said such a thing?!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/08/keynes-and-hayek?fsrc=gn_ep">Keynes and Hayek: Adventures in Wonderland | The Economist</a>.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hayek was concerned with principles, not with the political reality of implementing them. It is noteworthy, too, that Hayek—unlike Keynes—spent most of his life as an academic. Hayek never campaigned for a political party or advised the government of the day. He had little time for men who did not share his view.</p>
<p><strong>This is the antithesis of the conservative tradition. </strong>From Disraeli to Oakeshott, conservatism has been defined for its distrust of ideology, and a preference for pragmatism, compromise and what has gone before.</p>

<blockquote><p>After the Akin brouhaha, Paul Ryan was asked his opinion on rape and abortion. He said that “the method of conception doesn’t change the definition of life.”</p>
<p><a href="http://thepoliticalcarnival.net/2012/08/27/audio-pa-republican-candidate-suggests-that-having-a-child-out-of-wedlock-analogous-to-rape-paul-ryan-rape-a-method-of-conception/">Gottalaff wrote at the Political Carnival </a>about where this easily deployed logic actually ends up: <br />
<blockquote>So rape is just, you know, another way to conceive. There’s consensual sex, sex out of wedlock, and then there’s forcing a woman to do something against her will (rape), traumatizing her for life. All are equal, all are simply “methods of conception” and if a woman gets pregnant by any “method,” men like these, lawmakers like these, will tell her what she can do or can’t do with her own body. </p></blockquote>

What, are we tired of stupid remarks about rape now, so Ryan gets a free pass?” he asks. </p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/08/wall-streets-war-against-the-cities-why-bondholders-cant-and-shouldnt-be-paid.html">Wall Street’s War Against the Cities: Why Bondholders Can’t – and Shouldn’t – be Paid</a></p>
<p><strong><em>By Michael Hudson, a research professor of Economics at University of Missouri, Kansas City, a research associate at the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, and author of “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/THE-BUBBLE-BEYOND-Michael-Hudson/dp/3981484207">The Bubble and Beyond</a>,” which is available on Amazon.</em></strong><br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong> The pace of Wall Street’s war against the 99% is quickening in preparation for the kill. Having demonized public employees for being scheduled to receive pensions on their lifetime employment service, bondholders are insisting on getting the money instead. It is the same austerity philosophy that has been forced on Greece and Spain – and the same that is prompting President Obama and Mitt Romney to urge scaling back Social <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/08/#">Security</a> and Medicare.</p>
<p>Unlike the U.S. federal government, most states and cities have constitutions that prevent them from running budget deficits. This means that when they cut property taxes, they either must borrow from the wealthy, or cut back employment and public services. </p>
<p>For many years they borrowed, paying tax-exempt interest to wealthy bondholders. But carrying charges on these have mounted to a point where they now look risky as the economy sinks into debt deflation. Cities are defaulting from California to Alabama. They cannot reverse course and restore taxes on property owners without causing more mortgage defaults and abandonments. Something has to give – so cities are scaling back public spending, downsizing their school systems and police forces, and selling off their assets to pay bondholders. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>This has become the main cause of America’s rising unemployment, helping drive down consumer demand in a Keynesian nightmare. Less obvious are the devastating cuts occurring in health care, job training and other services, while tuition rates for public colleges and “participation fees” at high schools are soaring. School systems are crumbling like our roads as teachers are jettisoned on a scale not seen since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Yet <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/08/#">Wall Street<img src="http://images.intellitxt.com/ast/adTypes/mag-glass_10x10.gif"></a> strategists view this state and local budget squeeze as a godsend. As Rahm Emanuel has put matters, a crisis is too good an opportunity to waste – and the fiscal crisis gives creditors financial leverage to push through anti-labor policies and privatization grabs. The ground is being prepared for a neoliberal “cure”: cutting back pensions and health care, defaulting on pension promises to labor, and selling off the public sector, letting the new proprietors to put up tollbooths on everything from roads to schools. The new term of the moment is “rent extraction.”</p>
<p>So having caused the fiscal crisis, the legacy of decades of property tax cuts financed by going deeper into debt are now to be paid for by leasing or selling off public assets. Chicago has leased its Skyway for 99 years to toll-collectors, and its parking meters for 75 years. Mayor Emanuel has hired J.P.Morgan Asset Management to give “advice” on how to sell privatizers the right to charge user fees for previously free or subsidized public services. It is the modern American equivalent of England’s Enclosure Movements of the 16th to 18th century.</p>
