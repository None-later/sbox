                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/08/AR2007100801817.html?wpisrc=newsletter">This story in the Washington Post</a> is fascinating:</p>
<blockquote><p>A small private intelligence company that monitors Islamic terrorist groups obtained a new Osama bin Laden video ahead of its official release last month, and around 10 a.m. on Sept. 7, it notified the Bush administration of its secret acquisition. It gave two senior officials access on the condition that the officials not reveal they had it until the al-Qaeda release.</p>
<p>Within 20 minutes, a range of intelligence agencies had begun downloading it from the company&#8217;s Web site. By midafternoon that day, the video and a transcript of its audio track had been leaked from within the Bush administration to cable television news and broadcast worldwide. </p>
<p>The founder of the company, the SITE Intelligence Group, says this premature disclosure tipped al-Qaeda to a security breach and destroyed a years-long surveillance operation that the company has used to intercept and pass along secret messages, videos and advance warnings of suicide bombings from the terrorist group&#8217;s communications network.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone would read this as follows&#8230; a small private intelligence group was able to tap into the AQ pipeline.  They provided the info to the GW admin.  The GW admin then   made the information available to one and all, including AQ, which has since changed its M.O.  (Aiding and abetting, anyone?)</p>
<p>Via the <a href="http://blogreport.salon.com/">Blog Report</a>, <a href="http://www.floppingaces.net/2007/10/08/kos-upset-that-we-dare-to-ques/">here&#8217;s how a kinda prominent rightie blogger reads it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While this is being portrayed as a leak that cost the American military its chance to monitor al-Qaeda, it seems to me al-Qaeda just lost its communications. And a smart fellow, upon learning his communications network was compromised, would start using it to send fake stuff to put the U.S. military on wild goose chases.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>Looks like al-Qaeda just went back a few centuries.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/189700.php">Here&#8217;s another</a>:<br />
<blockquote>So, sorry to hear that SITE has lost its edge. And it really sucks that it was someone at The White House who leaked the video.</p>
<p>But why would you give the video to the White House and not to the FBI or CIA? The White House leaks like a sieve. That&#8217;s just the way the White House works.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also sorry to hear that this scared al Qaeda into being more cautious. In fact, that same day al Ekhlaas and a few other jihadi forums went down. There was a lot of speculation as to why. Some at the time claimed that the online Zionist conspiracy had hacked al Ekhlaas. But now we know why they went down: to upgrade their security measures.</p>
<p>But no matter how hard they try, they will never be as good as we are.</p>
<p>We pwn you al Qaeda and as Sahab. We. Frickin. Pwn. You.</p>
<p>Mwuahahahahahaaaaaaaaaa!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>So according to these guys, its either a good thing, or at least not a bad thing, that AQ is now aware that its network was compromised.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have enough snark available to comment.</p>

                                <p>Among proposals of the Bush administration is to cut future Medicare physician reimbursements by an average of 15% (10%, then 5%), actual cuts would vary by specialty.</p>
<p>This political game has been happening throughout much of the history of Medicare, but this proposal is a HUGE percentage.</p>
<p>(There is still an assumption by many that all physicians are wealthy, drive Mercedes, and etc. which is demonstrably not true, especially at the family practice and internal medicine level).</p>
<p>The AMA and the AARP have begun a major lobbying effort, and Congress will alter this (sometimes lobbyists do good things) eventually, solving the short run problem.</p>
<p>Medicare is also trying to cut reimbursements by denying claims, focusing on documentation rather than substance (and to be fair some providers should improve documentation, and there is fraud in the system). Medicare is also working on some interesting R&#038;D projects on meshing quality and reimbursement.</p>
<p>Clearly Bush (and the next President) have to make adjustments to Medicare costs (or to revenue) but how and where is a difficult question. This is not the way!</p>
<p>In the way of background, Medicare has always had an underpayment methodology, seeking to have the program subsidized by private insurers (the term is usually “cost shifting” which makes an accountant wince, as it is really “revenue stream manipulation”). This is a covert tax system on non-Medicare patients.</p>
<p>A research colleague of mine has a burning concern, “is it ethical for a physician to limit Medicare and Medicaid patients in order to manage patient mix, and therefore manage revenue?”</p>
<p>Having managed physician practices, I think patient mix management is an economic necessity (especially in family practice), although most of the time it is not very effective, the local population drives the patient mix. This does lead some providers to denial of service to Medicare and Medicaid patients though, which is a gut wrenching call for the providers but may be an economic necessity.</p>
<p>(If physicians are lucky the Medicare and Medicaid patients are distributed about equally to providers just by happenstance.)</p>
<p>The questions are complex, the answers are complex. Change or innovation is unlikely until 2009.</p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

He finds that income taxes are progressive, provided progressive means the top 400 taxpayers pay a lower tax rate than anyone else making $75,000 a year.  There are other oddball anomalies too, but basically, its good to make a high income.</p>
<p>He also looks at all taxes&#8230;  He only has this data in quintiles, but its also more or less progressive&#8230;</p>
<p>bottom 20% pay 18% of their income in taxes<br />second 20% pay 14% of their income in taxes<br />third 20% pay 16% of their income in taxes<br />fourth 20% pay 17% of their income in taxes<br />top 20% pay 19% of their income in taxes</p>
<p>Well, maybe this will encourage the poor to get up off their duffs and inherit some money like Paris Hilton for once.</p>

                                <p>As the dollar depreciation, will we get inflation?  Depreciation is a loss in the value of the currency.  Inflation is a loss in the value of the currency.  </p>
<p>I would argue we already have been experiencing inflation faster than the official figures since 2001&#8230;  the costs of things I buy &#8211; housing, transportation, food, and health insurance being the big ones, have all been going up faster than the numbers the BLS puts out.  Sure, electronic goods and some high end military equipment has seen price drops in that time, and presumably many Americans are now substituting away from steak toward ramen, and away from travel toward cable tv, and away from health insurance toward sickness&#8230; </p>
<p>But as the dollar loses value, will the electronic goods stop dropping in price (in dollars)?  Why should the price of something made in China drop in price measured in dollars if the Chinese currency begins to appreciate relative to the dollar?  And will the other costs continue to rise?  Providing health services means using a lot of equipment, some of which comes from abroad.  </p>
<p>So at what point does any of this get reflected in the inflation figures?  Or does it?  And at what point does currency devaluation become a real problem?  Or does it?</p>

<blockquote><p>Columnist Robert Novak said Saturday Ambassador Joe Wilson did not forcefully object to the naming of his CIA operative wife, Valerie Plame Wilson, when Novak spoke to him prior to the publication of a column that sparked a federal investigation and sent White House aide I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby to jail.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jesus H. Christ – this canard was debunked a long time ago.  But in case you missed it, <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/horsesmouth/2007/10/joe_wilson_chro.php">Greg Sargent</a> interviews Joe Wilson:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just got off the phone with former Ambassador Joe Wilson, and in our conversation he angrily disputed Robert Novak&#8217;s latest assertion about the outing of his CIA operative wife, adding that if the columnist isn&#8217;t going to confession, &#8220;he&#8217;s going straight to Hell.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>After Joe calmed down, he told Greg the truth. That Robert Novak is still lying about this is no surprise.  That Mike Soraghan reports Novak’s dishonest claims as facts suggests to me that The Hill should fire this idiot.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Our new troll has done it again.  He cherry picks a few quotes from a 7/20/2004 piece by David Corn called <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/20/opinion/main630711.shtml">Bashing Joe Wilson</a>.  Anon left out the real story:</p>
<blockquote><p>But now Wilson&#8217;s detractors on the right claim the critical issue is Wilson&#8217;s credibility on two points: whether his wife was involved in the decision to send him to Niger and whether he accurately portrayed his findings regarding his Niger trip. And they have made use of the Senate intelligence report &#8212; particularly additional comments filed by committee chairman Pat Roberts and two other Republican members of the committee, Kit Bond and Orrin Hatch &#8211; to pound Wilson. But not only does the get-Wilson crusade ignore the main question &#8212; did White House officials break the law and damage national security to take a swing at a critic? &#8211; it overstates and manipulates the material in the Senate report.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our new troll is an idiot!</p>

                                <p>ILSM has been alerting us to <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/feddebt/feddebt_aug07.pdf">this Treasury Report</a>. As of 9/30/2006, total Federal debt was near $8.5 trillion.  Eleven months later, total Federal debt (debt held by the public plus intragovernmental debt holdings) was nearly $9 trillion.  Note that intragovernmental debt holdings (e.g., those Social Security reserves) were about $250 billion greater than they were 11 months ago.  I wrote <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/question-to-dana-perino-who-should-pay.html">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bush’s own economists believe that total Federal debt will exceed $9 trillion by the end of this fiscal year, which translates into a deficit of $556 billion for the year. OK, they projected a much small rise in the debt held by the public as the surpluses of the Trust Funds was projected to be around $300 billion. Their projection for fiscal year ending October 31, 2008 looks even worse. OK, we know they’ve overestimated these things before to declare some sort of great improvement when the actual increase turned out less than their phony forecasts. Nonetheless, the General Fund is still huge and all this garbage about an improving unified deficit is nothing more than the rising Social Security surpluses.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few ignorant readers (CoRev for example) challenged this statement.  But check out what the Treasury is saying and you’ll see I got this right.  Seriously folks – isn’t time you learn to read financial statements?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I hate to do this but since CoRev insists my use of “general fund deficit” is somehow a dishonest thing to do, check out <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005_archives/000035.html">this Brad DeLong post</a>. Brad not only uses the term to discuss an important issue – he also defines it.  Now if CoRev is still too stupid to follow a SIMPLE discussion, I can’t help him.</p>

                                <p>This post attempts to rank Presidents by changes in issues important to the Religious Right:  abortions, marriage and divorce, and single parents.  This isn’t to say that these issues aren’t important to almost everyone else as well, but I don’t think I’m stereotyping members of the Religious Right by noting that many of them use one or more of these issues as part of a litmus test to determine how they should cast their ballot.  Interestingly enough, those who oppose them on these issues generally hope for the same trends; those on both sides of the abortion issue, for instance, want to see fewer abortions – Bill Clinton famously declared he hoped abortion would one day be :”safe, legal and rare.”  Similarly, most people can agree that society would probably be better off if marriages were more stable, or if more families grew up in two-parent households.  That isn’t to say that both sides agree on how to get there, of course, so its interesting to see how the Presidents most favored by the Religious Right have produced on these issues.</p>
<p>The methodology used in this post is the same as in previous posts used to rank Presidents by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">Economic Growth</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-fiscal.html">Fiscal Responsibility</a>, and the growth rate of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-personal-income.html">personal income</a>, and the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/ranking-presidents-ownership-economy.html">ownership economy</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with what may be the biggest lighting rod issue of them all over the last few decades… abortions.   Here’s a line graph showing how abortions per thousand live births have evolved since 1975, 2 years after Roe v. Wade:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpx77L0VjI/AAAAAAAAAxA/Rwu0hr3C5ck/s1600-h/abortions+per+thousand+live+births,+line+graph.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpx77L0VjI/AAAAAAAAAxA/Rwu0hr3C5ck/s320/abortions+per+thousand+live+births,+line+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Notice that the rate increased dramatically from the beginning slowed around 1977 or so, and then peaked in 1982.  Its been declining ever since.  The source of the data, plus a bar chart showing that series (and a few others) broken out by President are <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-abortions.html">here</a>.  Next, a chart ranking the Presidents:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpx07L0ViI/AAAAAAAAAw4/v749vjpz4Lc/s1600-h/abortions+per+thousand+live+births,+summary.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpx07L0ViI/AAAAAAAAAw4/v749vjpz4Lc/s320/abortions+per+thousand+live+births,+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I left out both the Nixon/Ford and GW administrations since only 2 years of data is available for each.  Note that neither administration fares well by this measure.</p>
<p>The best performing President is Clinton.  I note that in the two years since he left office, the rate of decrease of abortions per thousand live births has slowed, so this is not just a matter of catching a trend.  Carter on the other hand, may well be a victim of time and circumstances.  </p>
<p>Another fine morality related series deals with the net marriage rate… that is, the rate at which marriages exceed divorces.  Folks on the Religious Right would like to see this number as high as possible – first, because that means either more marriages (i.e., fewer people, ahem, living in sin), fewer divorces, or some combination of both.  Here’s a line graph showing what the series looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxv7L0VhI/AAAAAAAAAww/91rZryPwiPQ/s1600-h/net+marriage+rate,+line+graph.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxv7L0VhI/AAAAAAAAAww/91rZryPwiPQ/s320/net+marriage+rate,+line+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The data before 1970 is spotty, but it does appear that the net marriage rate dropped in the 1950s, and rose a bit in the 1960s.  Since then, the net marriage rate only seems to have risen briefly, dropping in most periods.  The source of the data, plus a bit more information, can be found <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-net-marriage-rate.html">at this post</a>.  And now a summary of changes by Presidency – note that in an attempt to approximate the administration periods, data for Ike is for 1955 and 1960, and for JFK/LBJ its for 1960 and 1970.  (Given the pattern observed, this should give the benefit of the doubt to Ike, and penalize JFK/LBJ slightly.)   So here’s a summary:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxq7L0VgI/AAAAAAAAAwo/m63R7Q3enS4/s1600-h/net+marriage+rate,+summary.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxq7L0VgI/AAAAAAAAAwo/m63R7Q3enS4/s320/net+marriage+rate,+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The net marriage rate seems to have increased only under Carter and JFK/LBJ.  It decreased the least under GW, followed by Clinton and Reagan.  The biggest declines occurred under GHW and Nixon/Ford.</p>
<p>And now, children living in two parent households.  Data is available for 1960, and then annually from 1967 forward.  </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxl7L0VfI/AAAAAAAAAwg/fikqrX6xDfE/s1600-h/children+in+2+parent+families,+line+graph.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxl7L0VfI/AAAAAAAAAwg/fikqrX6xDfE/s320/children+in+2+parent+families,+line+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Sadly, the series seems to have simply trended down, with only a flat areas and only one noticeable upward bump (from 1999 to 2000).  </p>
<p>Here’s a summary:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxg7L0VeI/AAAAAAAAAwY/MLAWfjqz1kA/s1600-h/children+in+2+parent+families,+summary.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxg7L0VeI/AAAAAAAAAwY/MLAWfjqz1kA/s320/children+in+2+parent+families,+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The percentage of children in two parent households declined under every President.  It declined the least under Clinton, followed by JFK/LBJ and Reagan.  (Reagan follows slightly, but we’ll give him the tie.)  The President who did the worst was Carter.</p>
<p>Now, let’s combine these rankings using a weighted average…  </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RwpxV7L0VdI/AAAAAAAAAwQ/L5TvgW5_qUA/s1600-h/Religious+Right+Rankings.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RwpxV7L0VdI/AAAAAAAAAwQ/L5TvgW5_qUA/s320/Religious+Right+Rankings.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Overall, the administrations under whom the Religious Right should have been happiest were those of JFK/LBJ and Clinton.  Aside from indicating that perhaps the Religious Right votes for the wrong candidates, what else can we learn from this?  Well, these are also the two presidents with the fastest economic growth rates, and did best at measures of personal income.  Wealthier people have more and better options.  Additionally, both these administrations had a focus on the poorest individuals – JFK/LBJ had the War on Poverty, and Clinton famously felt people’s pain.  But whenever Clinton and social issues are mentioned, inevitably someone insists credit belongs either to the Republican Congress or the Welfare Reform Act.  So let’s take a moment and look at those claims, shall we?</p>
<p>First, on abortions…  the annualized rate from 92 to 94, the last year before he took office, to the last year before the Republicans took Congress, the decline in the abortion rate per thousand live births declined 2.4% a year.  For the remaining six years it declined 1.8% a year.  And looking only at the post Welfare Reform Act… the decline remained at 1.8% a year.  If the Welfare Reform Act had any effect at all, it is not discernible in the data.  And if Newt and Company had any effect, it was to slow the decline in the rate of abortions.</p>
<p>What about the net marriage rate?  Well, the net marriage rate stayed constant from 92 to 94, and from 92 to 96.  Looking at the 94 to 00 period, the decline was 1.1% a year, and from the 96 to 00 period, it was 1.7% a year.   Now, that said, we do see an improvement in the number of children living in two parent homes after the Welfare Reform Act was passed.  This, together with the improving economy (it is said, after all, that the biggest cause of divorce in the US in money problems), seems to have provided an incentive to families to stay together when there were children involved.  </p>
<p>So from this, we can conclude…  if the Republican Revolution had an effect on any of these issues separate from the Welfare Reform Act, it was to arrest the decline in abortions.  The Welfare Reform Act was a bit more mixed… it may not affected the rate of abortions per live birth, seems to have encouraged divorces (and/or discouraged marriages) when there were no children, and had the opposite effect when children were involved.</p>
<p>What about other Presidents?  GW comes in third, but that’s probably a result of his record on abortion not being counted.  My guess… when more data is available GW will plummet to a ranking more like those we’ve seen him occupy on most other series, namely at or close to the bottom.  This would move Reagan up to a distant third – also something we’ve become accustomed to seeing on these series.  </p>
<p>In any case, it seems to me that many folks on the Religious Right would be less likely to vote for the Presidents that did the best job of getting results in those areas important to them, and more likely to vote on those who did a poor job on their issues.  Most voting theory seems to assume that people at least make some effort to vote on candidates likely to delivery on issues important to them.  Clearly, this is not the case for a sizable segment of the US voting public.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119179940086451698.html?mod=hps_us_whats_news">Amy Schatz</a> notes that Fred is indeed a small government conservative:</p>
<blockquote><p>While all the party&#8217;s leading candidates have embraced fiscal restraint, the former Tennessee senator seems likely to go further than his rivals. He has hinted at politically risky proposals to rein in Social Security and Medicare benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it would seem both Fred and Amy flunked basic arithmetic:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Thompson has advocated reining in discretionary spending and has been particularly critical of the Medicare drug-benefits program that Congress passed four years ago. He said he wouldn&#8217;t have voted for it. &#8220;I know this probably isn&#8217;t a real popular thing to say, but we couldn&#8217;t afford this prescription-drug bill,&#8221; Mr. Thompson said last week on a swing through Iowa, home of Republican Sen. Charles Grassley, who helped push the program through Congress. &#8220;We basically put a $72 trillion commitment on top of an already-broken entitlement system. Not a responsible thing to do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I was also critical of the way this benefit was designed giving a huge incidence of the subsidy to Big Pharma and not finding a tax base to fund this new entitlement.  But the $72 trillion figure struck me as a bit off so I checked with <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=10&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=fred_thompson_loses_tens_of_tr">Dean Baker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why then is Fred Thompson quoted in the WSJ as saying that the Medicare prescription drug benefit added $72 trillion to country&#8217;s obligations, without any explanation to readers that Mr. Thompson is off by a factor of seven. The projections of the cost of the Medicare Part D over an infinite horizon are less than $10 trillion. (Before anyone gets too concerned about even this seemingly large number [approximate 1.0 percent of future income], remember that it is driven by the assumption that the government will forever continue to grant patent monopolies that allow the drug companies to charge ever higher prices, instead of adopting a modern system for financing drug research. If we fix the system, all drugs can be sold at $4 per prescription.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The $72 trillion is likely the sum of the modest infinite horizon Social Security shortfall, the larger Medicare Part D shortfall, and the massive General Fund shortfall.  If Fred Thompson is so clueless to attribute all of this to Medicare Part D, I don’t want him in charge of our fiscal future.  And the Wall Street Journal should not allow Amy Schatz to cover economic issues if she can’t spot such an egregious error.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Continuing from my last posting, I stated the World Bank has seen the light. It has put out a report: <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEEI/214578-1110886258964/20748034/All.pdf">Where is the Wealth of Nations</a>? <br />Reason Online has an interview with the prime author<a href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/120764.html"> Kirk Hamilton</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Oil, soil, copper, and forests are forms of wealth. So are factories, houses, and roads. But according to a 2005 study by the World Bank, such solid goods amount to only about 20 percent of the wealth of rich nations and 40 percent of the wealth of poor countries.</p>
<p>So what accounts for the majority? World Bank environmental economist Kirk Hamilton and his team in the bank&#8217;s environment department have found that most of humanity&#8217;s wealth isn&#8217;t made of physical stuff. It is intangible&#8230;Hamilton&#8217;s team found that &#8220;human capital and the value of institutions (as measured by rule of law) constitute the largest share of wealth in virtually all countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The World Bank study defines natural capital as the sum of cropland, pastureland, forested areas, protected areas, and nonrenewable resources (including oil, natural gas, coal, and minerals). Produced capital is what most of us think of when we think of capital: machinery, equipment, structures (including infrastructure), and urban land. But that still left a lot of wealth to explain. &#8220;As soon as you say the issue is the wealth of nations and how wealth is managed, then you realize that if you were only talking about a portfolio of natural assets, if you were only talking about produced capital and natural assets, you&#8217;re missing a big chunk of the story,&#8221; Hamilton explains.</p>
<p>The rest of the story is intangible capital. That encompasses raw labor; human capital, which includes the sum of a population&#8217;s knowledge and skills; and the level of trust in a society and the quality of its formal and informal institutions. Worldwide, the study finds, &#8220;natural capital accounts for 5 percent of total wealth, produced capital for 18 percent, and intangible capital 77 percent.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For under developed or undeveloped countries you can see what direction they have to go in. But what about our country? We have had discussions about infrastructure. We have talked about the need for education. When I skimmed the report (200+ pages), savings was a must in order to be able to invest in the intangible capital. We have debated the share of benefit a person receives from the country&#8217;s infrastructure and institutions based on the wealth and/or income they control. We always argue about where growth comes from such that it raise all boats. (Sing that jingle!) And there is the “free market” debate revolving around regulation. Oh that nasty governance issue! If only we hadn&#8217;t signed on to form a more perfect union.</p>
<p>My quick assessment of this report is that it is a testament to the misdirection of our policies. We do not make money from money even though we have been trying to. You did catch the reference to “labor”. These breakouts of wealth suggest that there is a bottom limit to taxation as taxation reflects our investment in us. In the study, European countries dominate the top wealth and England is not in the top 10. This report implies that the wealthy do benefit more from the country&#8217;s structure and investment because the majority of their wealth is from this “intangible capital”. The few of the wealthy have accumulated their wealth from the investment of the many in the intangible.   It also means capital gains should be tax equal to labor if not higher.<br />
<blockquote>Rich countries are largely rich because of the skills of their populations and the quality of the institutions supporting economic activity,&#8221; the study concludes. According to Hamilton&#8217;s figures, the rule of law explains 57 percent of countries&#8217; intangible capital. Education accounts for 36 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>With only 18% of wealth from produced capital and less from natural resources as a country becomes wealthier, freeing up money to produce money as we have been promoting is very poor investment strategy it would seem when 77% of our wealth is from the human element. In a broad sense, we are talking about what ideology concerning the conduct of human life works best to produce wealth.<br />
<blockquote>An economy with a very efficient judicial system, clear and enforceable property rights, and an effective and uncorrupt government will produce higher total wealth. For example, Switzerland scores 99.5 out of 100 on the rule of law index and the U.S. hits 91.8. By contrast, Nigeria gets a score of just 5.8, while the war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo obtains a miserable 1 out of 100.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not just that we need to invest in education,or just have a legal system or just fix the bridges. These can be measured as noted in the World Bank <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/doing-business-world-bank-ranking.html">Doing Business </a>chart.</p>
<p>“Trust” seems to be the real intangible the report is talking about. We as a whole can be educated to the hilt, but if we can&#8217;t trust that our efforts will be put to constructive use, we have problems. Think habeas corpus, FISA, election fraud, threatening of the press, intimidation of speech, extension of free speech to none human entities, the equating of one voice-one vote to spending of one&#8217;s money, K Street project, etc. Think of the use of fear. If only a few are educated to the hilt or have access to the governance, we can not build capital.</p>
<p>If the country is 100 people large, but only 10 trust each other to do for each other, then how much wealth can they actually build if 93% of the 77% of intangible capital is related to law access (trust) and education (the removal of fear; trust) of the populace? But then, our founders seemed to have already reasoned this. Jefferson started the free education to including college!</p>
<p>So why should this report seem so “new”. This makes me think of the years of government bashing we have been hearing from the republican side. Reagan&#8217;s infamous “nine most dangerous words in the English language: I&#8217;m from the government and I&#8217;m here to help you.” It makes me realize we have to dump the Bush/neocon ideology here and in our foreign policy if only to remove the fear so that trust can return.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton&#8217;s example of the difference in thinking is in when he discusses pollution as a resource management issue:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s not a pollution problem; it&#8217;s a natural resources management problem. How do you maintain soil quality? How do you generate profits with the assets that you have, which in this case is land that can be invested in other things? The problem in China is they&#8217;ve figured out how to grow 9 percent a year pretty successfully but they&#8217;re now facing the environmental consequences of uncontrolled growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is policy that he is talking about. Policy of what to spend on and policy governing relationships both boiling down to regulation. (What was that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/friedman-externalities-and-difference.html">Milton quote </a>the other day?)We&#8217;re talking government. I interpret this report as making a case that shrinking government to where it can be drowned in a bath tub is not the way to build wealth. The market will not solve our problems of growth for us. It is not the answer to Save the Rust Belt&#8217;s question of how to save the rust belt? We have to do it and we have to do it in a manor that is inclusive for that is the only way to maximize the “intangible capital”. It also means we have to do as Cactus is attempting to do; qualify our policy results related to specific ideology. Just charting to see what GDP is doing or just looking at supply and demand theory won&#8217;t do it. That&#8217;s just bench racing.</p>
<p>The World bank has done some qualifying and changed their ideology:<br />
<blockquote>Hamilton: In the old days, we thought if you built the infrastructure then development would come-the Field of Dreams model of development. It turns out to be a lot harder than that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dare I suggest that the World Bank has discovered that an economy exists for our benefit and not for it&#8217;s own sake? Maybe they read our Declaration and our Constitution.</p>

                                <p>AB readers likely know I have not jumped on the Obama bandwagon just yet, but <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200710070003?f=h_latest">Fred Barnes</a> is working overtime to get me there:</p>
<blockquote><p>BARNES: Yeah, I doubt that she&#8217;ll pick him. You know, I&#8217;ve thought for a long time that Obama&#8217;s not in quite as strong a position on the war in Iraq as he really thinks he is. Remember, when he famously came out against the war, it was back in a time when the entire world believed that Saddam Hussein in Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, that he would probably be willing to use them himself at some time or pass them along to terrorists who would use them. And yet, Barack Obama was against going to the war at that point. I don&#8217;t think that shows that he is very strong on national security, which he needs to be. But that argument&#8217;s not going to be used against him in the Democratic primaries. It would, however, by Republicans in a general election. </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – Fred was trying to trash Senator Obama here but read his insightful 2002 speech as I turn the microphone over to <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/055284.php">Steve Benen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2002, Barnes was wrong about Iraq; Obama was right. That Obama didn&#8217;t follow the mistaken judgment of the DC establishment, Barnes said, necessarily means that Obama isn&#8217;t strong on national security. What&#8217;s more, Barnes believes this insightful criticism of Obama&#8217;s accurate judgment would be &#8220;used against him&#8230; by Republicans in a general election,&#8221; should he win the Democratic nomination. Oh, things one learns from Fox News&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fred sums up the modern GOP nicely.  Vote for us as we are incredibly stupid!</p>
