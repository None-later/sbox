                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Roger Ailes, not the one associated with Fox News, enjoys writing about Republican officials arrested.  His latest post is <a href="http://rogerailes.blogspot.com/2008_02_10_archive.html#1201363497164767828%231201363497164767828">this one</a>, about a member of the Maryland House of Delegates arrested as part of a child pornography investigation.  </p>
<p>Now, I can&#8217;t find a definitive list of Republicans and Democrats who have been arrested or convicted (and believe me, I looked far and wide for the book I&#8217;ve been working on), so what I&#8217;m about to write is based entirely on casual observation.  I may be dead wrong.</p>
<p>My impression is that while you see both Dem and Rep officials arrested for taking bribes, the &#8220;other reasons&#8221; Dems get in trouble are different than the &#8220;other reasons&#8221; Republicans get in trouble.  And bribes often aren&#8217;t such a bad thing&#8230;   you can rise to a high level position in the Democratic House of Republicans if you were caught on tape expressing some interest in being bribed in the Abscam scandal, or rise to a high level position in the Republican Senate and be your party&#8217;s nominee for President if you were one of the Keating Five.  Its all good.   </p>
<p>Maybe its my poor recollection, but the non-bribery-related criminal (or allegedly criminal or simply &#8220;poor judgment&#8221;) activity engaged in by Democratic officials tends to fall under the category of taking campaign contributions from shady characters.  Think Hsu, Al Gore&#8217;s lack of &#8220;controlling legal authority&#8221;, etc.  Reps tend to get snagged for sex-related issues &#8211; think Mark Foley or Larry Craig, but there are dozens are lesser known names, as Roger Ailes is frequently pointing out.</p>
<p>That isn&#8217;t to say there aren&#8217;t other things that get elected and non-elected high poo-bahs in trouble&#8230; for instance, there&#8217;s petty theft (think Claude Allen or Sandy Berger for recent examples), but it seems to be kinda rare.  And there are Dems that get in trouble for sexual issues (think Gary Hart and Bill Clinton for two high profile examples, even if neither was snagged for anything that was illegal) and Republicans that get in trouble for taking contributions from shady characters (look at the Giuliani and Romney campaigns for examples).  But Dem perps lean in one direction, and Rep perps lead in another.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing is what gets these perps in trouble is behavior that their party makes a big deal about being against.  Dems are for the little guy, but taking campaign contributions from big, shady characters is just about as un-little guy as it gets.  Republicans talk about morality all the time, but molesting a child is pretty far from moral behavior.  (I note that a large percentage of Reps with sex issues seem to involve homosexual activity, which of course is a big no-no to Reps in general.)</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s all I got on this subject.  Am I right about this?  If so, what&#8217;s the cause of it?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Corrections.  kf_in_dc and Bruce Webb pointed out that it was Mark Foley, not Foley that had the sex-related issues.  Michael Hendry suggested that with references to the Congress, use of the &#8220;Reps&#8221; as an abbreviation could be unclear (party or House?).</p>

                                <p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/02/16-percent.html">Greg Mankiw</a> provides a link to CBO’s latest (February) forecast for 2008 and 2009, which updated a forecast from the previous month.  CBO writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>CBO’s previous forecast, which was embodied in budget projections released in January, was finalized in early December 2007. However, data released since then–– especially regarding the labor market––indicate that economic conditions are weaker than previously projected, and conditions in some segments of financial markets remain worrisome. Other indicators––such as production indices and information on retail sales and sales of new homes––also suggest a slowing in economic activity. At the same time, changes in monetary policy have been more substantial than CBO assumed in December, and fiscal policy stimulus has been enacted. The Federal Reserve reduced the target for the federal funds rate by 125 basis points in January, and financial markets anticipate further easing in the near future. In addition, the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 will provide about $150 billion in tax rebates and business tax deductions in fiscal year 2008. CBO anticipates that the recent monetary and fiscal policy actions will provide significant support to the economy in 2008. The net effect of those developments since CBO’s previous set of projections is slightly stronger projected economic activity for 2008 (because the impact of monetary and fiscal policy stimulus slightly outweighs the deterioration in economic conditions absent those policy changes) and slightly weaker projected economic activity for 2009 (in part because the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus temporarily reduces economic growth). CBO’s projections are similar to the most recent Blue Chip consensus forecast, an average of the estimates of about 50 private-sector forecasters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Table 2 shows that CBO expects 1.7% real GDP growth for 2008 and 2.3% growth for 2009 with unemployment rising to 5.5%.  If I’m reading this right, the fiscal stimulus is indeed going to be temporary as planned but the amount of aggregate demand stimulus will not be enough to avoid a rise in unemployment over the next couple of years.  This sounds to me to confirm a lot of what Paul Krugman has been saying of late.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I was at first surprised by the title of <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2008/02/16/the_perils_of_a_weak_dollar">this</a> given how Brad has argued that a devalued dollar would raise our net exports.  As I read it, it seems Brad has not changed his mind.  Rather he is challenging the excuses offered by foreign governments to avoid the effects of their currencies appreciating with respect to the dollar:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this context, the fall of the dollar is not a surprise. But even as the dollar has fallen significantly against the euro, the pound, and the Canadian dollar, the world&#8217;s rapidly growing emerging economies have resisted market pressure for their currencies to rise against the dollar.  The resulting growth in these economies&#8217; foreign-currency reserves has helped finance the US deficit. Too many countries with strong economies now have weak currencies, which puts strain on the world&#8217;s economy and financial system.  It is better to produce goods &#8211; or financial assets &#8211; that can be sold at a premium in the global market than to produce goods and financial assets that must be sold at a discount. On the other hand, a weak dollar should help spur exports at a time when fewer Americans will be employed building and selling homes.  Europeans will start to find the United States an attractive location for factories, not just shopping excursions. German auto firms already are increasing investment in the United States. The alternative to a weak dollar is a US monetary policy aimed at supporting the dollar rather than stabilizing economic activity in the United States &#8211; an even less attractive option.  The United States now trades far more with Asia than with Europe and spends far more on imported oil than on imported European luxury goods. However, the central banks in the large emerging Asian economies and the major oil exporters generally have not allowed their currencies to rise by much against the dollar, even though their economies are growing faster than either the European or US economy.  While a weak currency helps these countries&#8217; exports, it is now contributing to a host of other economic problems. Inflation is rising. Real interest rates &#8211; the cost of borrowing less the inflation rate &#8211; are often now negative.  The fact that the dollar hasn&#8217;t fallen against the parts of the world with the fastest growth has put additional pressure on Europe. Europe would be far better positioned to sustain its expansion &#8211; helping to offset the US slowdown &#8211; if the euro were strong only relative to the dollar, not strong relative to both the dollar and the currencies of most of Asia.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad concludes with something I find impossible to disagree with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Global policy makers should start to think seriously about the best way to exit from a system where a number of countries around the world, in very different economic circumstances than the United States, are importing the consequences of the weak dollar. This above all requires a greater willingness on the part of those countries now intervening most heavily in the foreign exchange market to allow their currencies to appreciate. But it also probably requires far more cooperation among the major economies than has been the case recently.</p></blockquote>
<p>The next President will need to restore our place among nations in diplomatic discussions for a variety of reasons.  Brad points out that they may be economic benefits well beyond getting to exit Iraq.  It would be nice if the current President started laying some of the ground work for this but I’m not holding my breath.</p>

<blockquote><p>Obama has an astonishingly empty paper trail. He’s going around issuing promissory notes on the future that he can’t possibly redeem. Promises to heal the world with negotiations with the likes of Iran’s Ahmadinejad. Promises to transcend the conundrums of entitlement reform that require real and painful trade-offs and that have eluded solution for a generation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Promissory notes on the future sounds to me like the fiscal policy of George W. Bush.  After all, total Federal debt has passed $9 trillion.  Yes, this is partially masked by the fact that those Social Security Trust Fund reserves are being counted as offsets as Bush talks only about the unified deficit.  Bush gave seniors the Prescription Drug Benefit (talk about entitlement reform) paying for that as this God awful Iraq War with tax cuts.  Wait – you pay for increases in government spending with tax increases.  After all, there is the real and painful trade-off known as the government budget constraint.  Of course, George W. Bush denies that.  And Krauthammer complains about the promises from Barack Obama?  No wonder he had to publish this insanity at the National Review!</p>

                                <p>If <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080215/bs_nm/yahoo_microsoft_dc">Reuters</a> has this right, this sounds like a troubling conflict of interest:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of Yahoo Inc&#8217;s (YHOO.O) top institutional shareholders may be more interested in making sure Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) does not overpay for the Web pioneer, because they have more money invested in the bigger software maker, a research report said on Friday … A shareholder that owns both the target and an acquirer will be more interested in the net benefit of a deal, RiskMetrics said. Shareholders with more money invested in Microsoft than Yahoo will most likely urge Yahoo not to push its case too hard.  &#8220;They may be more concerned with whether Microsoft will get caught up in a &#8216;deal frenzy&#8217; and suffer the &#8216;winner&#8217;s curse&#8217; by overpaying for Yahoo,&#8221; RiskMetrics analysts wrote in an M&#038;A Edge Note. &#8220;We can expect shareholders who own both companies to pressure Yahoo directors to extract a material sweetener from Microsoft (which will help Yahoo directors save face) that isn&#8217;t seen to destroy the perceived benefits of the merger, prior to &#8230; ultimately succumbing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Many Yahoo shareholders would love it if Microsoft got caught in a deal frenzy, but as I have noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/what-is-value-of-yahoo.html">earlier</a>, Microsoft may not have to raise its bid of $31/share.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Okay guys, lets start an office pool to guess what the next big bubble is going to be.</p>
<p>Bubbles seem to be pretty common.  I am using the term a little loosely here, to describe any situation where three (and often four) things happen</p>
<blockquote><p>1. the perception of value of a property or investment swells (or is misrepresented to appear) far beyond its true value.  This may or may not be due to malfeasance.</p>
<p>2. persons familiar with or close to the property or with investment in general (insiders) take profit (extract true value from apparent value) from dealings in the property.  This may or may not be due to malfeasance.</p>
<p>3. the value of the property collapses, leaving less knowledgeable  investors (suckers) with empty bags, but often leaving the insiders flush.</p>
<p>4. A fourth element can be restitution paid by a secondary sucker to primary suckers.  Friends, relatives, charities, and various levels of government will often have to assist the primary suckers after the collapse.</p></blockquote>
<p>The South Sea Bubble, the Megatherium Trust, Tulip Mania, the Dot.Com Boom, the Bre-X gold mine bubble, the recent sub-prime housing bubble and Enron&#8217;s … well, Enron&#8217;s everything, all show this progression.  Various large frauds also show this progression.</p>
<p>Most of these properties had a real-value component (tulips, rum, slaves, electricity, international postal reply coupons) but that real value, as the bubble progressed, was dwarfed by expectations driven by advertisement or frank falsification.</p>
<p>Since value is a form of desire, the insubstantial component of the value of the bubble property is made up of faith, the willingness to expend real resources and effort toward an insubstantial goal.  The whole bubble might be called a faith-pump.  In the absence of really good drugs, faith is a limited resource.  In addition, faith is essential to all economic activity.  When Krugman talks about a crisis of faith, this is a crisis of the very yeast that makes large economies possible.</p>
<p>Most economic bubbles come into existence, grow and pop over a few years.  A much slower example of the faith-pump are the many US pension funds which have either been sucked back by the companies, or have lost value because of unfortunate or foolish investment choices.</p>
<p>Large bubbles must involve at least one large financial institution, if only to pay salaries, hold a line of credit, cover the phone, heat and light, and handle the incoming cash.  In addition, there must be at least the appearance of sense and oversight to the project, provided by other institutions.</p>
<p>Bre-X, the fake Canadian gold mine in Indonesia, was lent legitimacy by Kilborn Pacific Engineering Ltd, which evaluated the falsely enriched ore samples sent to them by Bre-X.  Enron had Arthur Andersen Accounting, and the South Sea Bubble beat them all with the Bank of England and the government of England.  These institutions must be either fooled or suborned, but they have to be there.</p>
<p>The net effect of a bubble is to move a portion of the wealth of less informed investors into the pockets of better-informed ones, or persons involved in the business.  Being less informed is only a partially correctable condition, since deceit and the involvement of apparently trustworthy guarantors is essential to the bubble.  Only an understanding of bubbles and their features is likely to be any help.</p>
<p>So now the question is, where is the next bubble likely to come from?</p>
<blockquote><p>* What has been deregulated lately?</p>
<p>* In what areas is regulation present but ineffective?</p>
<p>* What sectors or industries hide, or are capable of hiding, their intrinsic value?</p>
<p>* Where are there high cash flows that might be diverted?</p>
<p>* What sectors hold most of their value insubstantially by definition – that is, in the future, in plans, in possibilities?</p>
<p>* What possible investments are highly desirable by their nature – in medicine, in fast money, in unlikely benefits, in attractive oddities?  What pushes people&#8217;s hot buttons?</p></blockquote>
<p>As reliably as the next streetcar, the next bubbles are coming around the corner.  Their scrutineers are facts and reality, cool oversight, firm regulation.  Their supporters (knowingly or not) are foolish hope, greed, a belief in appearances, a desire for unearned benefits, laziness and a disregard for the public good.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the route listing on the next investment streetcar?   Is it #33 Nano-Tech?  #55 Micro-Processors, #18 Gene Engineering or #58 Anti-Geria Medicine?</p>
<p>Some of the streetcars, for sure, will take you to the bright downtown district of blues nightclubs, good food and big bank accounts.  But other routes will take you to the end of the line beyond the coldest of fringe suburbs – and from those routes you will have to trudge back home in the dark, after midnight.</p>

<p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/pushing-on-a-string">Paul Krugman</a> adds a graph to the discussion of why <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/monetary-policy-borrowing-costs-and.html">borrowing cost have not declined</a> with this commentary:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s the Fed funds target rate (red line) — which is what the Fed actually controls — versus the interest rate on Baa corporate bonds (blue line), which is probably a better guide to what matters for actual business spending. It’s pretty grim. Basically, deteriorating credit conditions have offset everything the Fed has done. Doubleplus ungood.</p></blockquote>
<p>My graph augments Paul’s graph (besides the fact that I used the effective Federal Funds rate rather than the target rate) by showing mortgage rates and interest rates on long-term (20-year) Federal bonds.  I’ve been rethinking this issue a bit.  First of all, mortgage rates have declined but not as much as the Federal Funds rate.  But more importantly, part of the rising spread between BBB rates and the Federal Funds rate is from a rising term structure as long-term Federal bond rates have not declined as rapidly as short-term rates.  </p>
<p>If we measure the credit spread as the difference between the BBB rate and the long-term Federal bond rate, it has increased from 1.42 percent in early July to 2.3 percent now. But this increase is not as dramatic as Paul’s graph would suggest.</p>

                                <p>One of our AB readers had asked me why I had faith that the Federal Reserve’s latest move to easier monetary policy might help shore up aggregate demand given his observation that it has not reduced borrower costs.  I attempted an answer to this question and it seems <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/opinion/15krugman.html?ex=1360731600&#038;en=d972d1a633a8b14a&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink">Paul Krugman</a> has weighed in:</p>
<blockquote><p>One simple measure of the seriousness of the credit problem is this: although the Federal Reserve has sharply cut the interest rate it controls over the past few weeks, the borrowing costs facing many companies and households have actually gone up.</p></blockquote>
<p>The main theme of Paul’s latest is that there is a crisis of faith that is being seen in the form of rising credit spreads.  While the easier monetary policy may be helping to offset this rise in credit spreads, Paul seems worried that this may not be enough to avoid a recession.</p>
