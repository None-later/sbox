                                <p>When someone attempts to impede democracy <a href="http://bentleyvillepresbyterian.com/2011/03/27/march-27-2011-john-831-47-the-truth/">actions are good things</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Writer and naturalist Henry David Thoreau was once locked up for refusing to pay a poll tax.  He opposed the tax on moral grounds – in a democracy, he argued, a man shouldn’t have to pay to vote&#8230;.</p>
<p>That night, so the story goes, Thoreau looked up from his jail cell to see Ralph Waldo Emerson&#8230;standing outside.  Emerson looked at him and asked, &#8220;Henry, why are you in there?&#8221;  Thoreau fired right back: &#8220;Ralph, why are you out there?&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>The man outside the bars may be every bit as much a prisoner as the one inside.  Or even more so, if his so-called freedom is built on a foundation of denial and lies.</p>
<p>Now, Thoreau was anything but a Christian.  That particular idea, though, was downright Biblical.  It’s more or less what Jesus is getting at [in John 8:31-47].  Jesus is comparing two kinds of freedom: the outward kind, built on a foundation of happy lies and outright denial, which in the end turns out to be just another kind of slavery; and the inward kind, which comes from a clean conscience before God, and can never be taken away.</p></blockquote>
<p>Far be it for me to cite The Sequel; I&#8217;ll take Bentleyville&#8217;s current Presbyterian minister* at his word. And tell anyone who happens to be <a href="http://occupywallst.org/">in the area of One Liberty Plaza</a> this afternoon to say &#8220;hello.&#8221;</p>
<p>*Full disclosure: one of the previous Ministers is an ex-roommate of mine.  That said, the above was found from a Google search, purely a fortuitous coincidence. At least as far as I know.</p>

It tells a scary store that dominates the political debates in Washington and that everyone is concerned about.</p>
<p>Looked at this way health care spending clearly looks like the monster that ate Tokyo.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3--KRbD3u-k/ToxgLQUn3HI/AAAAAAAABxk/qttSTvL5S3g/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3--KRbD3u-k/ToxgLQUn3HI/AAAAAAAABxk/qttSTvL5S3g/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>But the lesson one learns from a ratio chart like this depends on what is happening to both the denominator and the numerator.</p>
<p>If you look at the growth in health care spending in isolation the data creates a very different impression.</p>
<p>This data shows that in recent years the growth in health care spending has actually been slowing significantly. It shows that maybe the real problem is the weak economy, not rapidly growing health care spending.</p>

<p>The Plot Sickens – The Heart of the ACA Litigation Moves to the Supreme Court. </p>
<p>Maybe. Last week’s big political news concerning the PPACA (a.k.a. “Obamacare”) litigation was the administration’s decision to forego the option of asking the full membership of the Atlanta-based Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the appellate for several southeastern states, to hear and reverse the mid-August opinion by two members of a three-judge panel of that court striking down the individual-mandate provision of the ACA as beyond the constitutionally permissible reach of the Commerce Clause, the “enumerated power” in the Constitution under which Congress enacted the statute.  </p>
<p>This surprised some political pundits, but because anyone thought a majority of the members of that most conservative of regional federal appellate courts would disagree with the ruling—except possibly the part holding that the mandate provision was “severable” from the remainder of the Act and that therefore the Act remained intact except for the mandate provision.  Instead, they thought that the Obama administration wanted (or, more accurate, should want) to delay a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the statute, especially the mandate provision, until after the election next fall.  And if the full appellate court agreed to dissolve the panel’s opinion and hear the case—a long shot, in my opinion—this would do the trick.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />At least, that is, if the Supreme Court denied or postponed consideration of the petition for Supreme Court review of a majority opinion of a three-judge panel of the Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, the appeals court for Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennesee, in late June, written by conservative Bush appointee Jeffrey Sutton, upholding the constitutionality of the mandate provision.  Sutton’s opinion meticulously and eloquently deconstructed the plaintiffs’ arguments—which are the same as those by the individual human plaintiffs in all the other cases challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate.  He famously explained: First, contrary to assertions, the real basis for the plaintiffs’ claim is not that Congress lacks the authority under the Commerce Clause to mandate that everyone who is financial able purchase healthcare insurance in order to help defray the inevitable costs of their own emergency medical care when need arises and care is sought, but rather that this mandate unconstitutionally infringes upon individual liberty to remain self-insured.  And, second, the structure of the statutory mandate—that the individual obtain the insurance from a private carrier—no more infringes upon that individual liberty than would the imposition of a tax similar to the Medicare and Social Security tax laws, paid to the government for that purpose. If the claim is a constitutional right, a constitutional liberty interest, in remaining self-insured—and that is the claim—then the infringement on individual liberty comes not from the mandated purchase of the insurance from a private party but instead from the removal of the option to remain self-insured.  </p>
<p>And any infringement on individual liberty doesn’t morph into an unconstitutional infringement on liberty simply because the enumerated power under which Congress enacted the statute was the power to regulate interstate commerce (the Commerce Clause) rather than the power to tax in order to provide for the general welfare (the Tax Clause).  And constitutional authority conferred through the Commerce Clause doesn’t become un-conferred by the Commerce Clause just because the statute limits individual liberty.  Conflating the two separate grounds, neither of which can stand on its own, doesn’t transform a constitutional statute into an unconstitutional one.  No alchemy here. </p>
<p>Sutton’s analysis exposes the constitutional challenges to the individual mandate for what they are: a series of ideological clichés masquerading as legal argument.  As I wrote in AB shortly after the Sutton opinion was released, his analysis is so fine, so precise, that ultimately the Supreme Court’s opinion will echo it.  So I was not among those who were surprised that the administration is pushing for a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality or the statute before the 2012 election.  But all the judges thus far who have voted to invalidate the individual-mandate provision as unconstitutional are, in my opinion, intellectual lightweights, and so I’d wondered whether the Sutton analysis itself could be persuasively deconstructed by a judge or justice who is not.  </p>
<p>The answer appears to be no.  Last week, a panel of yet federal appellate court, this one the one for Washington, D.C., heard arguments in yet another case challenging the constitutionality of the mandate as beyond Congress’s Commerce-regulation authority because it infringes upon the liberty of individuals to remain self-insured, it requires the purchase of a “product” from a private party, and, well, um, the scope of the statute is really sweeping.  I mean, what’s next, asked one of the two stalwart rightwing-intellectual-heavyweight members of the panel?  Congress mandating the purchase of GM cars by the wealthy in order to prevent the collapse of that company during the next economic downturn, upon pain of payment of a penalty for failure to do so?  (I hope so. Then, when David Koch has a heart attack in his Maserati and the ambulance attendants verify through the Secretary of State’s offices in his various home states that there is no GM car registered in his name, the attendants dump his gasping-for-breath body in the road, where he’s run over by a Cadillac SUV.) </p>
<p>A sigh of relief was in order—although I had to wait until I stopped smiling like a Cheshire cat.  That judge, Brett Kavanaugh (a former law clerk to Justice Kennedy, circa 1993), reportedly commented earlier to the plaintiffs’ lawyer that maybe the courts shouldn’t interfere with what could be the beginning of the mass privatization of the social safety net.  More likely, I think, it will prompt, finally, a single-payer healthcare-insurance system—Medicare for all—in order to cut out the spiraling costs of a private, multi-carrier, for-profit system whose premiums reflect, in part the investment losses of those private companies.  But don’t tell Judge Kavanaugh until after that appeal is over. </p>
<p>***** </p>
<p>Much as the administration and its many litigation opponents—which include 26 states, which are challenging another part of the statute—want a quick Supreme Court adjudication of the constitutionality of the statute, there is some possibility that the Supreme Court will hold that it lacks “subject-matter jurisdiction”—i.e., legal authority—to consider the challenges at least to the mandate provision until sometime in 2015, when the mandate provision becomes effective and the IRS collects the penalty.  This is pretty esoteric procedural stuff, and it was the subject of an earlier AB post of mine last spring in which I said I thought that outcome in the Supreme Court was unlikely.  But in early September a 2-1 majority of the Richmond, VA-based Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the appellate court for the Carolinas, West Virginia and a couple of mid-Atlantic states, along with Virginia, last month ruled exactly that.  The issue concerns a federal “jurisdictional” statute called the Anti-Injunction Act (the AIA), and the Supreme Court’s interpretation of that statute in two opinions issued on the same day, concerning the current statute’s predecessor, in 1922.  </p>
<p>Sutton and his two colleagues rejected the argument.  And the dissenter in the Fourth Circuit case, Andre Davis, dismantled his colleagues’ analysis as absurd.  I agree Davis.  But as law prof. Brad Joondeph, who writes a blog devoted entirely to the ACA litigation, and who is featured prominently in AB posts of mine from last June, wrote recently, the language of the AIA, and the Supreme Court’s earlier opinions interpreting it, may not matter here.  </p>
<p>What might? If a majority of justices, for various reasons, want to punt on the issue of the constitutionality of the ACA until after—comfortably after—next year’s elections.  I don’t think they will.  But I’m probably wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Social Security For The Young</strong></p>
<p>Intelligence Squared U.S. (corrected link: http://intelligencesquaredus.org/) is sponsoring an Oxford-style debate Tuesday evening in Manhattan. The program is entitled &#8220;Grandma&#8217;s Benefits Imperil Junior&#8217;s Future&#8221; The resolution:</p>
<p>&#8220;Commitments made to seniors decades ago failed to foresee the harsh economic realities of the present. Do entitlements saddle our children with unmanageable debt, asking them to sacrifice their future for the sake of the elderly? Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid were created to provide a social safety net. But if we cut these programs, are we balancing the budget on the backs of the aged and sick, leaving behind society’s most vulnerable?&#8221;</p>
<p>Arguing for the motion will be Fox &#8220;News&#8221; commentator Margaret Hoover and U.S. News and World Report editor-in-chief Mort Zuckerman.</p>
<p>Arguing against will be former DNC Chair and Vermont Gov. Howard Dean and Roosevelt Institute economist Jeff Madrick.</p>
<p>Does keeping promises to the elderly mean sacrificing our children&#8217;s future?</p>
<p>The answer is, &#8220;NO! This is nonsense. Social Security has NOTHING to do with balancing the budget.</p>
<p>But while you will hear the lies the enemies of Social Security have been telling for 75 years, it is not certain the defenders of Social Security will explain the simple truth.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The simple truth is that Social Security has nothing to do with &#8220;the harsh economic realities of the present&#8221; except to provide the insurance payments that people paid for &#8220;just in case&#8221; of harsh economic realities like the present.</p>
<p>Social Security is NOT in trouble. It is not broke. It is not going to go broke. It can&#8217;t ever go broke.</p>
<p>Unless you believe the lies and let them break it.</p>
<p>With NO CHANGES AT ALL Social Security can continue to pay &#8220;all&#8221; benefits forever at a level that is &#8220;enough&#8221; by today&#8217;s standards.</p>
<p>So why do we keep hearing that is going to go broke and create huge budget deficits&#8230; unless we raise huge taxes on the young&#8230; or &#8220;the rich&#8221;?</p>
<p>Well, because there are highly paid liars &#8212; they call them &#8220;non partisan experts&#8221; &#8212; who are paid to tell you this.</p>
<p>And you, dear reader, will have to think very hard to free yourself from the lies. They have been telling you lies since you were a child, charitably giving &#8220;lesson plans&#8221; to the schools, so that well meaning, but not very well informed, teachers would teach the lies to children too young to know they were being lied to. So you would grow up and every time you heard &#8220;Social Security.&#8221; you would think, &#8220;it won&#8217;t be there for me. it&#8217;s going broke.&#8221;</p>
<p>And even those people who partly know better can only say &#8220;it&#8217;s not going broke&#8230; not yet anyway.&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s not going broke, it will be able to pay 80% of benefits&#8230; so it&#8217;s only 20% broke,&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s not going broke&#8230; we can make the rich pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s not going broke at all. Not even one percent. Not ever. And it doesn&#8217;t need to be fixed. And the rich don&#8217;t have to pay for it.</p>
<p>In fact the whole point of Social Security is that it is NOT a tax on the rich. It is NOT welfare. It is not even &#8220;government spending.&#8221; It is the only way that workers have to save their own money for their own retirement protected from inflation and market losses.</p>
<p>Social Security is a very smart way to protect workers savings by a simple idea called &#8220;pay as you go with wage indexing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way it works is something like this. [There are some details here that I have simplified to make the point easier to follow. They do not change the basic idea, or the &#8220;cost&#8221; to workers in any important way.]</p>
<p>When I was young I made a dollar an hour. If the payroll tax then was what it is today [it was a lot less] it would mean I paid about 6 cents an hour to Social Security, and my boss contributed another six cents. My 12 cents, times 2000 hours per year times about 100 million people [if the population was the same&#8230; it was a lot less] would add up to enough money to pay the retirement needs of about 50 million old people [there were a lot fewer]. Fifty years later, workers doing the same work I was doing are making about ten dollars an hour. So they contribute about $1.20 to their Social Security. That means that $1.20 times 2000 hours per year times 100 million people would be available to pay the retirement benefits of 50 million retirees. In other words, to pay my current Social Security benefits, there is ten times as much money available as i was paying in&#8230; with no change in the tax rate.</p>
<p>Some of this is &#8220;just&#8221; inflation, but enough of it is a real increase in wages over that time. This real increase in wages translates into a real effective &#8220;interest&#8221; on the money I paid into Social Security, allowing me to collect more than I paid in. Even the part that was &#8220;inflation&#8221; would have been hard for me to earn in interest over those fifty years.</p>
<p>Now it happens that over that time, the ratio of the number of beneficiaries to the number of workers has changed, but so has the tax rate. The ratio of workers to beneficiaries has gone from ten to one to about three to one. So the tax rate has gone from 2% to 6%. That is not a &#8220;terrible problem.&#8221; It merely reflects the gradual phasing in of Social Security. This meant that on a pay as you go basis the early worker-beneficiaries got a bargain. On the other hand, those early workers had supported their own parents and paid for welfare for others, lived through the depression and fought World War 2, and served in the draft, and built the infrastructure that makes it easier for you to make money than it was for them. But it does not mean that later worker-beneficiaries are bearing a cruel burden. They are paying in no more than they will get back. In fact they are paying less, because of that pay as you go effective interest we just talked about.</p>
<p>If there were no Social Security you would still have to save at least as much money as you now save via the payroll &#8220;tax.&#8221; Moreover you would have to earn at least enough interest to pay for inflation, and you would be lucky to earn enough interest to equal the effective interest that &#8220;wage adjustment&#8221; through Social Security provides you. You might do better than that. Or you might do a lot worse. Social Security is insurance to prevent you from doing worse. The &#8220;rate of return&#8221; is not bad, but that&#8217;s not the important point. The important point with insurance is the difference between &#8220;enough&#8221; and &#8220;not enough.&#8221; Social Security provides you with enough to retire if all else fails.</p>
<p>The hardest part of saving enough on your own would be actually saving the money in the first place. Most people can always find something more important today than saving money for tomorrow. And then tomorrow comes sooner than they expect. The second hardest part would be keeping up with inflation. And the third hard part would be not losing it all to a bad investment or just a bad decade on the stock market.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s basically how it works. No tricks. No magic. No anxious hopes. No &#8220;if only&#8217;s&#8221;. No greedy geezers. No taxes on the rich. No trips to the welfare office. Just you saving for your own basic retirement. There is no reason this can&#8217;t continue forever.</p>
<p>So why does &#8220;everybody know it&#8217;s going broke and it won&#8217;t be there for them&#8221;?</p>
<p>Because everybody has been lied to. You have been lied to your whole life, and you will have to work very hard to understand that. All the little lies will pop into your head saying, &#8220;No&#8230;it&#8217;s really a Ponzi scheme.&#8221; &#8220;no, it&#8217;s really greedy geezers,&#8221; &#8220;no. the return on investment is really lousy.&#8221; &#8220;no, the return on investment is really too generous.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not going broke. Ever. But here is why they get away with saying &#8220;it&#8221; is.</p>
<p>Back in 1983 there was some danger it COULD go broke. There was a lot of inflation and a lot of unemployment at the same time, and the Social Security tax rate had not been raised enough to pay for the benefits the workers would need. [it was 8%]. They fixed that problem then by raising the rate to 11.4%, scheduled to rise to 12.4%. But this rate was actually higher than needed to just pay for Social Security&#8217;s needs on a pay as you go basis. The extra was put into a Trust Fund &#8212; that means it was saved in a legal way so the money, and the interest it earned could only be used to pay for Social Security benefits. So in effect the Baby Boomers would be paying in advance for their own retirement needs above the normal pay as you go rate. This Trust Fund is exactly like a savings account you might set up to pay for your kid&#8217;s college. It grows until the kid goes to college, then it is draw down to pay for his expenses. And it runs out of money about the time he graduates. So the Social Security Trust Fund is expected to run out of money just about the time the Baby Boomers run out&#8230;. of a need for benefits.</p>
<p>It is this running out of the Trust Fund that the politicians and journalists point to and shout that &#8220;Social Security is going broke.&#8221; But the Trust Fund is NOT Social Security. It&#8217;s a bridge fund to help pay for the Boomer retirement. It is SUPPOSED to run out of money.</p>
<p>After that, Social Security goes back to &#8220;pay as you go with wage indexing.&#8221; And it can continue on that basis forever.</p>
<p>But there is one more little wrinkle in the story. While the Trust Fund is paying for the Boomer retirement, the &#8220;young&#8221; are going to be living longer than their grandparents did. If they are going to be living longer, they will need to save a little more for their retirement.</p>
<p>Or they can wait and not retire as soon as they might have wanted. Or they can retire on time and take a little less each month in order to make their savings last the longer time they will need it.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, with no change at all, Social Security can pay for them to retire on time, and pay &#8220;all&#8221; benefits over their life expectancy at a monthly rate that would be considered &#8220;enough&#8221; by our standards today. But because the people of that time will be making about 60% more (real) money than we are today, they may want to retire at the same higher standard of living&#8230; that is keep the same monthly rate of benefits that people get today (which would be worth more than today&#8217;s). If they will want to do this&#8230; keep the same &#8220;replacement rate&#8221; and the same retirement age, they would need to raise their savings rate (payroll tax) about 2% for the worker and 2% for the employer. This will not be a hardship for them because they will be making 60% more than you are today. And the really good news is they don&#8217;t have to do this all at once. In fact it would be better if they raised it about a tenth of a percent per year over the next twenty years. They would never notice the increase&#8230; because their wages are going up. But they sure would notice having to put off their retirement, or having to live on a pension that was &#8220;enough&#8221; for their grandparents, but won&#8217;t buy what the people living in the same time and in the same neighborhood are going to &#8220;need.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Social Security cannot go broke. It can always pay &#8220;all&#8221; benefits. But you will have to defend it from the liars, and you will have to decide what tax rate you are willing to pay in order to get the level of benefits you will want at the age you will want to retire.</p>
<p>To put it simply, if you want to keep the same retirement age, and the same relative replacement rate you would need to raise your tax rate at least one half of one tenth of one percent per year&#8230; that&#8217;s forty cents per week in today&#8217;s terms.</p>
<p>Or you could take the chance of having to work for the boss until you are ready for the glue factory. Even if you don&#8217;t want to stop working when you are 65, or 62, you may like the idea of having your Social Security to back you up while you try to do something really worthwhile with the rest of your life.</p>
<p>But you are going to have to undo a lot of lies if you are going to save your Social Security for your own needs.</p>
<p>Small note on math:</p>
<p>The average worker is making 1000 dollars a week today; he is paying 60 dollars a week for his Social Security, and his boss is contributing a matching 60 dollars. This leaves him with 940 dollars a week to live on (and pay other taxes). The average SS beneficiary gets about 400 dollars a week.</p>
<p>In 2040 or so the average worker will be making about 1600 dollars a week. With no change in the payroll tax, he would pay 96 dollars a week into SS. his boss would match that. leaving him with 1504 per week to live on&#8230; The average beneficiary would get 640 per week&#8230;. IF he wasn’t going to live longer. To make the money last a life time that is about one third longer he would have to settle for 480 dollars per week.</p>
<p>Or he could have raised his payroll tax by 2%. then he would pay a tax of 128 dollars per week, and his boss would match that. leaving him 1472 per week to live on &#8230; And the average beneficiary would get that 640 per week without having to delay his retirement for years. Note the trade off. He gives up 32 dollars a week out of 1500 while he is working in order to gain 160 dollars a week out of about 500 while he is retired. And this doesn&#8217;t even count the gain that worker will get from the &#8220;effective interest&#8221; we talked about.</p>
<p>Look at those numbers. It’s hard for young people to really understand that they are going to get old, and they are not going to want to work until they are ready to die, or may not even be able to work. You are going to have 530 dollars more per week after tax than you have today even if you raise your own tax the 2% that would be enough to allow you to retire young enough to enjoy it, with enough money to live about the way your neighbors live&#8230; the way you lived before you retired.</p>
<p>This is not a crushing burden. It’s called being richer, and using some of your extra money to pay for a longer, happier retirement.</p>

<p>FREQUENTLY MALIGNED CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ACTUALLY DETER FINANCIAL WRONGDOING, STUDY FINDS 
<p>Though often criticized as frivolous and lacking economic benefit, new research by finance and accounting professors at Rutgers and Emory universities’ business schools finds that class action lawsuits are a strong deterrent to misrepresenting corporate financial results and other wrongdoing.  And, in many instances class actions are a stronger deterrent than SEC enforcement.    <br />“Our research found statistically and economically significant deterrence associated with both SEC enforcement and class action lawsuits,” said Simi Kedia, Ph.D, MBA, associate professor of finance at Rutgers University School of Business in an interview with The Investor Advocate.  “We looked at firms in the same industry as the enforcement target and found that the average peer firm subject to SEC action and/or litigation reduces discretionary accruals (i.e., reporting as sales transactions for which payment has not been received) equivalent to 14 percent to 22 percent of the median return on assets in the aftermath of such enforcement.”  <a name="more"></a>  <br />The study, a working paper presented at a couple conferences and now being circulated for comment before publication, measured the effectiveness of the two primary methods of federal securities regulatory and law enforcement:  “public” enforcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission; and, “private” enforcement through securities class action lawsuits.    <br />Regulatory Failures Enhance Importance of Class Actions     <br />A recent story by the New York Times’ Gretchen Morgenson reported on why private lawsuits are particularly important at a time when federal failure to enforce the law is considered one cause of our on-going financial-economic crisis and of public discontent with government:    <br />“When federal authorities don’t fulfill their obligation to enforce the law, they essentially give an imprimatur to the financial entities to do whatever they want and disregard the law,” said Kathleen C. Engel, a professor at Suffolk University Law School in Boston. “To the extent there are places where shareholders and borrowers can pursue claims, they are really serving the function of the government. They are our private attorneys general.”     <br />Lawsuits have long been a crucial method for shareholders to recover losses. A February letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission from the general counsel of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System noted that private litigants in the 100 largest securities class action settlements had recovered $46.7 billion for defrauded shareholders.”     <br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/business/aig-to-sue-bank-of-america-over-mortgage-bonds.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/business/aig-to-sue-bank-of-america-over-mortgage-bonds.html</a>     <br />“I am not surprised at all that rigorous unbiased research now proves class action law suits are a robust deterrent to financial fraud and wrongdoing,” explained Salvatore J. Graziano, Esq., president of the National Association of Shareholder and Consumer Attorneys.  “On behalf of defrauded institutional investor clients, securities plaintiffs’ attorneys routinely conduct thorough and ground breaking investigations of corporate defendants including securing information from knowledgeable former employees in our civil prosecutions.  In fact, private investor lawsuits at times also help further investigations by the SEC and other federal agencies.”     <br />Indeed, the new study found that in cases where both the SEC and class action lawsuits take action, on average private lawsuits precede SEC action by 297 days .     <br />Not surprisingly, the strongest deterrence effect was found when both SEC proceedings and class actions are launched.    <br />Class Actions Recover More Money &#038; Can be Stronger Deterrent than SEC     <br />“Class action lawsuits, although often maligned as frivolous and socially wasteful, can have positive externalities by curbing aggressive reporting behavior of peer firms,” the paper by Dr. Kedia and her colleagues states.  Indeed, class action lawsuits recover far more money – twice as much or more &#8212; from wrongdoers than SEC actions, according to sources cited by the professors.  And, in most situations, the deterrence value of class actions (in the absence of SEC enforcement) is actually stronger than that of the SEC when acting without a corresponding class action.    <br />This first study to validate the enforcement value of class actions through empirical research was conducted by Dr. Kedia and Shivaram Rajgopal, Ph.D., Chartered Accountant and Schaefer Chaired Professor of Accounting at Emory University’s Goizueta Business School, with Jared Jennings, a doctoral student at the University of Washington’s school of business.  Their paper, entitled “The Deterrence Effects of SEC Enforcement and Class Action Litigation,” reports their analysis of 474 SEC actions alleging financial statement misrepresentation and 1,111 class action lawsuits alleging violations of Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures during 1996 through 2006. The paper was first circulated for comment in June.   <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1868578">http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1868578</a>  <br />Among other findings, the professors reported:    <br />&#8212; “The SEC publicly targets a very small fraction of firms – in our sample only 0.74% of firms were subject to SEC enforcement. At these low levels of enforcement, a substantial fraction of misreporting is likely to go undetected.  Therefore, if potential miscreants consider the probability of detection to be too low, they are unlikely to change their behavior.”     <br />&#8212; “Securities class action litigation for alleged reporting irregularities is more likely against an average firm &#8211; in our sample 1.28% of firms are subject to class action litigation.  The greater likelihood of class action litigation, combined with higher monetary sanctions, likely renders lawsuits as a potentially effective way to deter reporting irregularities at peer firms.     <br />The purpose of the research was to empirically measure the value of SEC enforcement actions at a time when the Commission has been criticized as ineffective.  It also sought to assess the value of securities class action lawsuits, a legal remedy for investors and private enforcement mechanism that has been attacked for many years within corporate and political arenas.</p>

<p>Repatriation Holiday Lobbying&#8211;Money Speaks&#8230; </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve discussed repatriation before&#8211;the tax break being pushed by multinationals who want to bring some of their offshore profits home without paying taxes, as they did in the 2004 &#8220;one time only&#8221; repatriation break. </p>
<p>The reason they have so much money offshore is that they use gimmicks&#8211;such as transfers of intellectual property rights to offshore subsidiaries in low-tax jurisidctions.  These are pseudo transfers (to affiliates) of property they would NEVER really sell out of their companies to independent third parties.  Having the affiliate &#8220;own&#8221; the right means that the profits associated with the innovation carried out in the US go to the offshore company and aren&#8217;t subject to US tax until they&#8217;re officially treated as being transferred back to the parent.  &#8220;Selling&#8221; the IP to the affiliate is done solely to defer/avoid US taxes on those profits.  Of course, the transfer pricing for the intellectual property is gimmicky too&#8211;since no company would sell its main moneymaker, the idea of a comparable market price is foolish to start with.  So most of those profits should have been treated as US profits all along&#8211;and subject to tax.</p>
<p>A repatriation holiday would just mean more money in the pockets of the uberrich&#8211;the managers and some of the owners.   It&#8217;s just another corporatist tax giveaway that pushes upward redistribution that moves us even more resolutely towards oligarchy.  It won&#8217;t create jobs&#8211;companies already have plenty of cash to invest in this country if they thought they had customers to make money from. <br />But the companies probably have a pretty good chance of getting the break, even though it is a stupid waste that adds to the inequality problem and does nothing for creating jobs.  Why? <br />Read after the jump! <br /><a name="more"></a>First, because some of the wealthiest and most powerful companies want it. And these days, what powerful companies want, Congress tends to be willing to give.  Google, Apple, Cisco, Oracal, and many other companies that depend on their outsourced IP are hoping they can avoid even the little bit of tax that they&#8217;ve paid in the past. </p>
<p>Second, because those companies have hired as lobbyists people who were very recently staffers to members of Congress who will be writing the law.  The most notorious of these is Max Baucus&#8217;s former Chief of Staff, Jeffrey Forbes. See Rubin &#038; Drucker, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-29/google-joins-apple-mobilizing-lobbyists-to-push-for-tax-holiday-on-profits.html">Google Joins Apple in Push for Tax Holiday</a>, Bloomberg.com, Sept. 29, 2011.  The piece notes that Forbes is part of an army of more than 160 lobbyists, 60 of which are former congressional staffers, who are pushing for the repatriation holiday.  And those aren&#8217;t really all the lobbyists&#8211;they are just the &#8220;registered&#8221; lobbyists&#8211;i.e., the proverbial &#8216;tip of the iceberg&#8217;.  Then there&#8217;s the WINAmerica coalition and the firm working with it.  This army of lobbyists is out to rape the country, and the same congresspeople who moan and lament about deficits are likely going to give the multinationals an $80 billion (over ten years) tax break just cause their buddies ask them nicely for it.</p>
<p>Even though we have proof that repatriation doesn&#8217;t create jobs&#8211;the 2004 tax holiday resulted in thousands of jobs LOST as companies fired workers even while repatriation millions&#8211;Congress is still contemplating another one.  Why?  The article notes that one thing that is being touted as an advantage is &#8216;flooding the US with cash.&#8217;   Doubtful.  Much of that cash may already be sitting in US banks even though not repatriated through the company.  And what is actually brought over and then paid out to managers (in even bigger outsized bonuses) and shareholders (in buybacks or dividends) is perhaps more likely to be invested in Asian markets than it is to stay in the US.  Or it will be just more fodder for the rich managers and shareholders to use to buy shares in the secondary markets from their rich peers, that top crowd that owns most of the financial assets.  Lot of good that will do the carpentars and drill press operators and other ordinary workers.</p>
<p>One of Boehner&#8217;s aides says that former staffers don&#8217;t make policy.  Balderdash.  Those staffers are hired to lobby because they have access and they know their former colleagues.  They have access that ordinary Americans don&#8217;t have.  They are pushing for legislative action on behalf of corporate giants.  None of them likely gives a damn that the policies they are pushing for don&#8217;t make economic sense at all for ordinary Americans.  Why should they care?  They are lobbyists in it for their own financial rewards from &#8220;selling&#8221; an idea to their former colleagues that will benefit their current bosses.</p>
<p>Martin Sullivan has it right, as quoted in the Bloomberg article:<br />The proposed holiday would reward the companies that have most aggressively parked profits in tax havens such as Bermuda, the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/cayman-islands/">Cayman Islands</a> and Switzerland, said Martin A. Sullivan, a former Treasury Department economist and contributing editor for the non-partisan Tax Notes.<br />“A lot of what companies report as foreign profit is really U.S. profit that should be subject to U.S. tax,” Sullivan said. “Those earnings didn’t get overseas by accident. Many of these companies intentionally put them there to avoid paying U.S. taxes.”</p>
