                                <p>Although a lot of people are aware that &#8216;Low Cost is Out There&#8217; it is difficult to impossible to find anyone who takes it seriously. Some experts simply dismiss it out of hand (Samwick), others point to the Stochastic Projections and simply deem it unlikely (Biggs), then again others reject it on grounds that run from legitimate ($130/barrel oil; $8 bushel corn futures) to ridiculous (fertility {a long story to explain why}). But the fact remains that unlikely does not mean impossible, we may very well see outcomes approaching Low Cost. And if we do the result will rock our world, because the Brave New World of Low Cost has real world implications that range well beyond retirement security.</p>
<p>So I propose we throw probability considerations to the wind and undertake a guided tour through LowCostLand. To switch literary references those that dare can follow me through the Looking Glass.</p>

<div></div>
<p>Figure II.D6 from the 2008 Report shows us the contrast between Intermediate Cost (II) and Low Cost (I) at a glance. The chart shows Trust Fund ratios over time under all three alternatives provided by the Trustees. Alternative II or IC shows the standard and familiar narrative, the growth in the Trust Fund ratio slows after 2014 stalls in 2017 and then shrinks more or less rapidly until the Trust Fund is exhausted in 2041. (We should note that the stall in the growth of the ratio does not immediately show as an absolute shinkage in the dollar balance, that actually continues to grow until 2023, the distinction between TF ratio and cash balance will be important later on). Alternative III or High Cost shows much the same picture only accelerated. But we are here to examine Alternative I, that of Low Cost.</p>
<p>Here we see the TF ratio continuing to increase all of the way to 2023 and  a level of 450, then a decline down to 390 by 2041, then about a fifteen year period of relative stability until around 2055 which is followed by a marked upward movement through the rest of the 75 year actuarial window. For the purposes of this post I intend to ignore the period past mid-century, it has interesting implications of its own, ones that I have already covered in my old post from 2006 <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/01/interest-on-interest-threat.html">Interest on Interest: a Threat</a>. Instead I want to look at the medium term consequences of Low Cost between 2008 and 2041.</p>
<p>Okay, lets look at first order effects. If we flash forward to 2041 we see some pretty self-satisfied Boomers, (including that cranky old guy waving his cane in the air yelling &#8220;I told them rat bastards!! Right back in Ought Eight!!!&#8221; Don&#8217;t worry about old Mr. Webb, buy him a glass of beer and he quiets right down). Under Low Cost outcomes they ended up with 100% of scheduled benefits, in their case the equation runs 100% of 160% = 160%. Moreover their kids either already in retirement or nearing it also look to get full benefits without having to endure an increase in retirement age. And just as important the grandkids were able to pay for it all at the same 12.4% rate the Boomers paid. The question of intergenerational equity never ends up getting raised. At this point we could wrap up the fairy tale in traditional fashion with &#8220;And they all lived happily ever after&#8221;. But instead we are going to invoke that incredibly annoying TV pitch man Billy Whatisname and cry out &#8220;But wait!! There&#8217;s more!!!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Because there is. What happens if we translate that curve into dollars? The Trustees present future outcomes in both constant 2008 dollars and in then current dollars. To keep relative tax burdens steady I propose to use the former and so use <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#140103">Table VI.F7.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Constant 2008 Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a>. First thing to note is that Low Cost does not mean No Cost, that dip in the ratio between 2023 and 2041 represents transfers from the General Fund to Social Security. For example in 2025 the gap between Social Security tax revenue and Cost is $68 billion. Okay a substantial sum of money but only 24% of the actual interest earned that year. In 2035 we are looking at a bill of $159 billion or roughly the same as the amount we are apparently raising effortlessly for this years stimulus package and still only 48% of the interest accrued that year. But by 2045 the needed transfer is down to $104 billion. In 2055 down to $40 billion and finally in 2065 Low Cost has Social Security back with a cash surplus of $18 billion.</p>
<p>Which tells us what? Well a couple of things. First the fact that we never need to pay more than half of the interest owed in any given year means that the effective interest rate on the Special Treasuries is much lower than the nominal rate during the payback period from 2023 to 2060, in fact at that latter date we will be paying interest at a rate of .15% or about 40 times less than the nominal 5%. But it is the second fact that is the most mind-blowing. Under Low Cost there is never any need to pay back any of the principal. None, zip, nada. If you look at the numbers of Intermediate Cost you see the functional equivalent of a fully amortized loan, that is interest only to 2023 and then totally paid down by 2041. Under Low Cost that loan in translated into interest only from about 2027 to 2061, at ever dropping rates, and then can if we choose simply be written off. Now whether the people living in the years after mid-century choose to take this course or not is not under my control, I won&#8217;t be caring either way by that point, but that future outcome has some real world implications for the year 2008.</p>
<p>Back to Table VI.F7. When we talk about current and projected debt at levels around $9 trillion and rising we normally concede at some point that we will have to pay it all back, which leads people to cluck their tongues about the Present Value of all that debt. But at this point in time a full 24% of that outstanding debt is represented by the Special Treasuries in the Trust Fund, and that percentage is scheduled to rise sharply over time. Under Intermediate Cost assumptions Intragovernmental debt for Social Security rises to over $5.5 trillion in non-inflation adjusted dollars by 2023 (about $5 trillion in constant dollars) and all has to be paid off with additional cost for interest over an eighteen year period. And almost all of this debt repayment occurs within the current term of the 30 year bond. Which means that to one degree or another it is already being priced in with the expectation that Treasury will have to go hat in hand to the public (and the Chinese Central Bank) to borrow that $5 trillion plus interest. Unless if doesn&#8217;t have to, under Low Cost all that is required is a much smaller amount of borrowing to pay off only a portion of the interest owed on the Trust Funds.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave it to better arithmetic minds to calculate the discount. But a lot of our thinking about current accounts, the affordability of tax cuts, the strain represented by future medical costs is colored by the prospect of having to pay down trillions in debt to Social Security over the next three decades and still coming out with a benefit cut in 2041. Under Low Cost the need for that pay down almost vanishes, trillions and trillions of dollars we have mentally committed to Social Security simply moves to the other side of the ledger. In the Brave New World of Low Cost things are possible that we haven&#8217;t dared imagine.</p>

                                <p>When we noted how little effect on oil prices <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/anwr-two-cents-gallon-in-generation.html">ANWR</a> might have, we had to endure the following comment from a certain troll:</p>
<blockquote><p>PGL it is you who needs to take in the entire analysis by not focusing exclusively on ANWR, it isn&#8217;t the issue, it is only one tiny piece of the issue, and that is opening up all US oil fields that are currently off limits. Any one field would have, as you pointed out, little impact and that many years away. But the cumulative affect of all of the fields being opened will have a substantial impact.</p></blockquote>
<p>But <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_06/013935.php">Kevin Drum</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Offshore oil reserves affected by the federal ban are estimated at 18 billion barrels, which is indeed larger than ANWR. However, EIA projects that offshore production rates would be about half of ANWR production rates, which means that lifting the ban on offshore drilling would probably have an even smaller effect on future oil prices than ANWR&#8217;s 75 cents a barrel in 2025. In other words, &#8220;tiny&#8221; was probably the wrong word in my concluding sentence above. &#8220;Minuscule&#8221; is more like it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin noted this in a “correction” after he read <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/otheranalysis/ongr.html">this report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The projections in the OCS access case indicate that access to the Pacific, Atlantic, and eastern Gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030. Leasing would begin no sooner than 2012, and production would not be expected to start before 2017. Total domestic production of crude oil from 2012 through 2030 in the OCS access case is projected to be 1.6 percent higher than in the reference case, and 3 percent higher in 2030 alone, at 5.6 million barrels per day. For the lower 48 OCS, annual crude oil production in 2030 is projected to be 7 percent higher—2.4 million barrels per day in the OCS access case compared with 2.2 million barrels per day in the reference case (Figure 20). Because oil prices are determined on the international market, however, any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK &#8211; if we open everything up, maybe the effect in 20 years will be closer to $0.03 a gallon with the effect today being next to nothing.  That&#8217;s not exactly a &#8220;substantial impact&#8221;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/lifestyle/free_forbes/2008/0407/072.html">An article in Forbes</a> states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brilliant doctors often work closely with big drug companies, and they seem to like their corporate partners just fine. Too fine, say their vocal critics&#8211;no doctor can have objective views about Lipitor when he takes Pfizer&#8217;s money to develop or test it. But when the critics are doctors themselves, as they quite often are, keep in mind that there&#8217;s a deeper conflict in play here that the critics never acknowledge or discuss. By working at the cutting edge of pharmacology in close collaboration with Big Pharma, top-tier doctors are taking over the whole medical show. It&#8217;s because of their work that so many of their less able colleagues are destined to provide doc-in-a-box services at Wal-Mart, at cut-rate prices prescribed by Big Insurance or Big Government.</p></blockquote>
<p>There you go. Directly stated with no reservation. Status. Monetary connections. Drugs replace other kinds of care. No links, no on the other hand. I wonder what my doc might say as a general practioner and on the low end of the pecking order. Be careful what you wish for, you might get it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Attendant: Welcome aboard Ala Carte Air, sir. May I see your ticket? </p>
<p>Passenger: Sure. </p>
<p>Attendant: You&#8217;re in seat 12B. That will be $5, please! </p>
<p>Passenger: What for? </p>
<p>Attendant: For telling you where to sit. </p>
<p>Passenger: But I already knew where to sit. </p>
<p>Attendant: Nevertheless, we are now charging a seat locator fee of $5. It&#8217;s the airline&#8217;s new policy. </p>
<p>Passenger: That&#8217;s the craziest thing I ever heard. I won&#8217;t pay it. </p>
<p>Attendant: Sir, do you want a seat on this flight, or not? </p>
<p>Passenger: Yes, yes. All right, I&#8217;ll pay. But the airline is going to hear about this. </p>
<p>Attendant: Thank you. My goodness, your carry-on bag looks heavy. Would you like me to stow it in the overhead compartment for you? </p>
<p>Passenger: That would be swell, thanks. </p>
<p>Attendant: No problem. Up we go, and done! That will be $10, please. </p>
<p>Passenger:  What? </p>
<p>Attendant: The airline now charges a $ 10 ca r ry-on assistance fee. </p>
<p>Passenger: This is extortion. I won&#8217;t stand for it. </p>
<p>Attendant: Actually, you&#8217;re right, you can&#8217;t stand. You need to sit, and fasten your seat belt. We&#8217;re about to push back from the gate. But, first I need that $10. </p>
<p>Passenger:  No way! </p>
<p>Attendant:  Sir, if you don&#8217;t comply, I will be forced to call the air marshal. And you really don&#8217;t want me to do that. </p>
<p>Passenger:  Why not? Is he going to shoot me? </p>
<p>Attendant:  No, but there&#8217;s a $50 air-marshal hailing fee. </p>
<p>Passenger:  Oh, all right, here, take the $10. I can&#8217;t believe this. </p>
<p>Attendant:  Thank you for your cooperation, sir. Is there anything else I can do for you? </p>
<p>Passenger:  Yes. It&#8217;s stuffy in here, and my overhead fan doesn&#8217;t seem to work. Can you fix it? </p>
<p>Attendant: Your overhead fan is not broken, sir. Just insert two quarters into the overhead coin slot for the first five minutes. <br />P ass enger:  The airline is charging me for cabin air? </p>
<p>Attendant:  Of course not, sir. Stagnant cabin air is provided free of charge. It&#8217;s the circulating air that costs 50 cents. </p>
<p>Passenger:  I don&#8217;t have any quarters. Can you make change for a dollar? </p>
<p>Attendant:  Certainly, sir! Here you go! </p>
<p>Passenger:  But you&#8217;ve given me only three quarters for my dollar. </p>
<p>Attendant: Yes, there&#8217;s a change making fee of 25 cents. </p>
<p>Passenger:  For cryin&#8217; out loud. All I have left is a lousy quarter? What the heck can I do with this? </p>
<p>Attendant:  Hang onto it. You&#8217;ll need it later for the lavatory.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>John McCain <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080619/ap_on_el_pr/mccain">gave a speech today</a> intended to brush up his credentials on energy issues, and called for 45 new nuclear reactors to be built by 2030 (and possibly 55 more thereafter) and $2 billion per year in spending on &#8220;clean coal&#8221; programs.</p>
<p>[sound of crickets chirping]</p>
<p>There are 104 operational civilian nuclear power reactors in the U.S. now.  In 2030, the median age of those reactors will be 52 — the youngest will be 34.  Figuring the working life of a reactor at 40-50 years, the bold McCain nuclear program might just about replace the nuclear generating capacity that will reach the end of its useful life.  That assumes, of course, that the new capacity could be installed at costs more like $2,000/kW (recent experience outside the U.S) than a pessimistic $5-6,000/kW; at the latter figure, wind would already be cheaper and could replace nuclear-generated electrons for the existing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity">pumped-storage hydropower</a>.</p>
<p>The main virtue of the clean coal initiative, meanwhile, seems to be that it would create fewer CO2 emissions from the combustion of cash than McCain&#8217;s Iraq war policies.</p>
<p>McCain Economic Clown Show Update: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/19/us/politics/19nuke.html">Elisabeth Bumiller&#8217;s version of the story</a> (which manages to omit mention of the coal part of the story) opens:<br />
<blockquote>Senator John McCain said Wednesday that he wanted 45 new nuclear reactors built in the United States by 2030, a course he called “as difficult as it is necessary.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She also finds Douglas Holtz-Eakin making sure we all know the value of &#8220;difficult&#8221; is &#8220;not too difficult&#8221; and seemingly having difficulty with gross versus net additions to the nuclear fleet:<br />
<blockquote>Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Mr. McCain’s chief domestic policy adviser, said Mr. McCain had arrived at the goal of 45 as consistent with his desire to expand nuclear power, “but not so large as to be infeasible given permitting and construction times.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Practical, maybe, but if it&#8217;s &#8220;necessary&#8221; then Mavericky Boldness — really, the one thing McCain has to sell to non-Republicans at least in the eyes of the Village — might dictate policies that recognize that 22 years is a long time to remove existing constraints.  Those 52 oldest reactors in the current fleet, after all, came on line in less than 10 years from the late &#8217;60s to the late &#8217;70s.  I&#8217;m sure Axelrod and Plouffe will be happy to know that the underlying message is &#8220;America: almost as good as in the 1970s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, in the comments Lord and K Harris make excellent points regarding the true underlying socialism practiced by theoretically pro-market Republicans like McCain and George W. Bush.  Here&#8217;s David Cay Johnston with something to keep in mind, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Free-Lunch-Wealthiest-Themselves-Government/dp/1591841917">Free Lunch</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The dominant group [in Washington] is thick with politicians like [California Rep. Bill] Thomas.  In public they speak of free enterprise and the virtues of competition. Behind closed doors, however, they work to create a paradise of corporate socialism for the few&#8230;</p>
<p>These are the Washington corporatists, whose hearts bleed for every company and industry complaining that the rules, and often the market, are unfair.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The opening of the ANWR 1002 Area to oil and natural gas development is projected to increase domestic crude oil production starting in 2018. In the mean ANWR oil resource case, additional oil production resulting from the opening of ANWR reaches 780,000 barrels per day in 2027 and then declines to 710,000 barrels per day in 2030 &#8230; Crude oil imports are projected to decline by about one barrel for every barrel of ANWR oil production &#8230; Additional oil production resulting from the opening of ANWR would be only a small portion of total world oil production, and would likely be offset in part by somewhat lower production outside the United States. The opening of ANWR is projected to have its largest oil price reduction impacts as follows: a reduction in low-sulfur, light crude oil prices of $0.41 per barrel (2006 dollars) in 2026 for the low oil resource case, $0.75 per barrel in 2025 for the mean oil resource case, and $1.44 per barrel in 2027 for the high oil resource case, relative to the reference case.</p></blockquote>
<p>The median case suggests the effect on gasoline prices in 2025 will be a mere $0.02 a gallon.  The immediate effect will be zero as we’ll have to wait a decade to see any oil from ANWR.  If this is Bush’s and McCain’s answer to today’s high gasoline prices, it is no answer at all. Menzie closes with this observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fortunately, a holiday for the gasoline tax, which works in the wrong direction for reducing energy dependence, has dropped off the table. One has to be thankful for small blessings.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>President Bush waited until he was about 7.5 years into his Administration to have his big push for offshore drilling and John McCain has pulled another one of his flip-flops to support this pandering to those frustrated by high gasoline prices.  But will the proposal alleviate the current sting every time we have to put more gasoline in the tank.  It seems <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-offshore18-2008jun18,0,3372420.story?track=rss">Douglas Holtz-Eakin</a> says no:</p>
<blockquote><p>Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a senior advisor to McCain&#8217;s campaign, acknowledged in a conference call to reporters that new offshore drilling would have no immediate effect on supplies or prices.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Some actual wisdom managed to slip past the editors of the <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MjhhMTA4NzQ2YTQ4YjZkNzI0YzYyNmVhOThlM2I3ODA=">National Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Calling for more domestic development and energy conservation, McCain sought to distance himself from both Barrack Obama and the Bush administration. In this he may have been successful, but he failed to outline a coherent and non-contradictory approach to energy &#8230; The biggest headline from McCain’s remarks was his call for more oil and gas development at home, “because the price of oil is too high, and the supply of oil is too uncertain.” Where McCain has been lukewarm in his support for domestic development in the past, he came out foursquare in favor of more offshore drilling yesterday, so long as coastal states get a share of the proceeds and are wiling to go along. This could free up as much as 18 billion barrels of oil and 76 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, based on current estimates, but won’t do much to curb the high price of gas.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not endorsing everything that Jonathan Adler wrote – especially since he forgot to tell us that this 18 billion barrels is something that will take a long time to come to market and only if the market price of oil is quite high.  But admissions from the National Review that McCain is flip flopping and that this Administration proposal will do nothing to change the current market price of gasoline is refreshing honesty from what had unfortunately been a rightwing rag in the past.</p>

                                <p>BlogLand has come up with two very similar and very fair and balanced comparisons.  Both rely on some very good analysis from the <a href="http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/blog/_archives/2008/6/17/3749641.html">Tax Policy Center</a>. Ladies first as in <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/06/who-loves-you-more-obama-or-mccain-or-bush">Economist Mom</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Tax Policy Center just updated their estimates of the cost of the Obama and McCain tax plans–estimates that show that the Obama tax proposals would reduce revenues by $2.7 trillion over ten years (same as their previous estimate), while the McCain tax proposals would reduce revenues by $3.6 trillion over ten years (slightly lower than previous $3.7 trillion).  As I’ve pointed out before, these are the revenue loss amounts compared with the official CBO baseline under current law, and as such, these are the revenue losses that matter if one is determined to comply with the pay-go rules … So in aggregate, at least in terms of tax cuts, McCain loves taxpayers (even) more than Bush loves taxpayers, and Bush loves taxpayers more than Obama loves taxpayers.  All of them are not so fond of our children and grandchildren though, because they’re all willing to have our children and grandchildren (aka future taxpayers) pay for all that love they’re willing to give to us current taxpayers.  But how much the candidates love you, in particular, depends a great deal on how “rich”, or not, you are.  With his tax cuts, Senator Obama loves those who are not so rich a lot more than he loves those who are.  Senator McCain, on the other hand, really loves the really rich.  In fact, with his tax cuts, Senator McCain loves the really rich even more than President Bush has loved them.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/baselines-shmaselines">Paul Krugman</a> is quite succinct:  </p>
<blockquote><p>The key point, again: because of all those middle-class tax cuts in the Obama plan, he collects only 0.4% of GDP more in taxes than McCain. The tax collection comes from different people: lower and middle-income Americans would be substantially better off under the Obama plan. But where is the money for health care reform?</p></blockquote>
<p>Paul also notes this from the Tax Policy Center:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is an easy way to cut through this palaver. Forget the baseline. Just think about three numbers: How much would either candidate collect in taxes as a share of the Gross Domestic Product? How much is government likely to spend? And, how much would they have to cut that spending to keep the national debt from ballooning.  TPC estimates that in 2013, Obama would collect revenues of 18.2 percent of GDP. McCain would bring in about 17.8 percent. Spending that year would be about 19.5 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office, assuming the Iraq war will be winding down.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Obama’s proposals are not fiscally responsible even if there are less fiscally irresponsible than McCain’s.</p>

<p>For all the worries about the Fed having to raise rates this fall to fight inflation I suggest you look at this relationship. It suggests there is little or no reason to worry about either higher inflation or higher fed funds.<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SFkHykVR2eI/AAAAAAAAASM/JCDpdGnh66M/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SFkHykVR2eI/AAAAAAAAASM/JCDpdGnh66M/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" border="0"></a></p>

                                <p>NWA has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/business/18air.html">joined the crowd</a> of domestic airlines announcing (even more) capacity reductions, and their <a href="http://www.nwa.com/corpinfo/newsc/2008/pr061720082015.html">announcement</a> contains this head-scratcher:<br />
<blockquote>As a result of the reduced capacity, Northwest is removing a combination of 14 B757s and Airbus narrowbody aircraft from the fleet.</p>
<p>In addition, the DC-9 fleet will be reduced from 94 aircraft at the start of 2008 to 61 aircraft (20 DC9-30s and 41 DC9-40s/50s) by year-end.  [Emphasis added.]</p></blockquote>
<p>The DC-9s have been overdue for retirement for some time, so that part of the reduction makes sense enough.  Parking the Airbuses, not so much when there are DC-9s still to retire.  While they are a bit big compared to the DC-9-50 (to the tune of around 25 seats; the A319 is the direct substitute in terms of seating capacity), the <a href="http://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?Table_ID=297">cost statistics</a> via NWA&#8217;s latest filings with the DOT indicate that the A320 is cheaper to fly than any DC-9 in flying operations expenses.  Significantly, fuel issuance is considerably less for the bigger and heavier A320 even versus the 105-seat DC-9-30 (937 gallons/hour vs. 1039-1215 [*]).  Plus, you know, there are more seats to sell (or offer someone an empty middle seat, remember those?).</p>
<p>Maybe there&#8217;s something about the particular planes they want to park (that isn&#8217;t also something about the ancient DC-9s)?  Otherwise, it looks like someone has their head up a fleet planning model.</p>
<p>[*] Note the decarbonization potential from replacing the relatively aged domestic airline fleet.</p>
