                                <p>by divorced one like Bush<br />caution, a long read</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading: Making Government Work by Ernest F. “Fritz” Hollings.  Yes, that Hollings of Gramm and Rudman legislation fame.  It is kind of rambling read, but I now understand why our congress of the democratic party side has been acting like moderate republicans and not liberal or progressive.  I recommend it just as a bit of a fly on the wall experience, be it a southern conservative Democratic fly.  He does not like unions.  He does not like free trade as currently practiced.  </p>
<p>And, as much as he hates unions, he can not see that his fight against GATT and NAFTA in support of the textile industry as jobs moved south and over seas is and was the large version of his attracting jobs from the north east because of the cheap, non-union labor.  He understands the impetus of cheap labor found in Mexico and China for business as a problem of “free trade” for our country as currently practiced, but totally fails to see it in his anti-union position.  He can see the “fight” between nations for capital in flows due to labor cost advantages and how that is harmful to higher developed nations, but Hollings never indicates an understanding that he helped create the game of pitting one area of people against another by bidding down labor when he promoted the south as a union free area.  That is, he sold his state, and thus sold out the northeast and the north midwest auto/rust belt social progress by bidding a lower labor cost.  He fails to see his south played and still plays the roll of China to the unionized areas of America.</p>
<p>I mention this as an introduction to a person mentioned in the book who gave testimony in front of his senate committee hearings on GATT and NAFTA 11/15/94: Sir James Goldsmith.  I present him and this bit of history as a compliment to Stormy&#8217;s postings on trade and the related postings regarding ours and the worlds current economic condition.  Senator Hollings listened, but he did not hear.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Goldsmith">Sir Goldsmith</a> you can imagine, is no small potatoes.  Nor is his background of the character one would expect as to be not so much in favor of GATT and NAFTA.  Consider:<br />
<blockquote>Anglo-French billionare financier<br />The Goldschmidts (family name changed to Goldsmith), like their neighbors and relatives the Rothschilds, had been prosperous merchant bankers in Frankfurt since the 16th century.   <br />He was a greenmail corporate raider and asset stripper. (Including US timber companies.)<br />In 1990, Goldsmith also began a lower-profile, but also profitable, global &#8220;private equity style&#8221; investment operation. By 1994 executives working in his employ in Hong Kong had built a substantial position in the intermediation of global strategic raw-material flows.<br />Goldsmith&#8230; believed Britain had been victim of a socialist conspiracy and that communists had infiltrated the Labour party and the media.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, what are you thinking?  Money and more money, of the world market&#8230;total conservative.  Certainly eccentric, if not a little paranoid regarding the communist bogyman.  Except, he wrote a book in 1993: <a href="http://buzzflash.com/hartmann/05/10/har05010.html">The Trap</a>.<br />From the intro:<br />
<blockquote>We have convinced ourselves that there exists only one valid economic and social model: our own. By attempting to impose it universally, we have exported to almost every corner of the world our diseases: crime, drugs, alcoholism, family breakdown, civil disorder in urban slums, accelerated abuse of the environment and all the other problems that we experience daily.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But, this is the money quote:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The economy is a tool to serve us. It is not a demi-god to be served by society.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So, with no further ado, I present the Ross Perot of Europe in the epic battle of free trade, <a href="http://www.alanwattsentientsentinel.eu/english/transcripts/Alan_Watt_Blurb_Sir_James_Goldsmith_US_Senate_Speech_Oct192007.html">Sir James Goldsmith</a>: (the audio of the transcript is at the same site)<br />
<blockquote>I believe in free markets, I believe in free enterprise and I believe the purpose of the economy is not just to improve indices but to improve the state of the nation&#8211;yours, mine. So I&#8217;m not an anti-free-market man nor an anti-free-enterprise man; quite the contrary.<br />[regarding a prior witness] What you&#8217;ve heard today is the view from big business, of which I was part. <strong>And I believe the view from society in general is totally different.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s pause right here and let that statement sink in.  Society has a different view of the effects of “free trade” as practiced.<br />
<blockquote>That&#8217;s nothing to do with productivity, Mr. Chairman; that&#8217;s moving to get the cheap labour forty times cheaper. And please don&#8217;t think this is unskilled jobs; these are skilled jobs; these are high-tech jobs going there. Of course there are also the unskilled jobs, but the skilled ones are going to highly skilled people and they are moving offshore; and if you think that&#8217;s productivity, then I think you would be wrong.</p>
<p>Well, surely the measure of competitiveness is the balance of trade. And as you, Senator, pointed out, if you have the second worst balance of trade in history, 150 billion dollars, that&#8217;s not being competitive in world markets.</p>
<p>In his [prior witness] testimony he talks about 500 billion dollars to be invested in China. And then what does he say? He says what America needs&#8211;and no doubt this is true about Europe as well&#8211;is an increased rate of savings. What for? To invest in China?&#8230;we can&#8217;t increase our rates of savings just to invest them elsewhere and where we bleed to death in terms of capital and we bleed to death in terms of jobs. </p>
<p>And this is the big point, Mr. Chairman. <strong>What we are witnessing is the divorce of the interests of the major corporations and the interests of society as a whole.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Ok, time out.  I just want to make a plug for my coined bit of nomenclature: United Corporations of Global.  It&#8217;s an entirely new nation that has no grounding to any boundaries of the continents and thus no patriotism to any nation.  Let&#8217;s all chant: UCG, UCG, UCG, UCG&#8230;</p>
<p>Sir James Goldsmith goes on in his opening to present some figures showing the decline to society&#8217;s non-GDP measures since free trade has come on the scene.  So we&#8217;ll skip to the closer quote:<br />
<blockquote>Now I&#8217;m not here as a bleeding heart liberal; I&#8217;m a hard-headed realist and it is my view that <strong>if we try and make profits and at the same time destroy our nations, no one will benefit from it&#8211;even those who make the profits</strong>. <em>(can you say &#8220;2008&#8221;?)</em> </p></blockquote>
<p>Returning to the beginning of this post regarding Senator Hollings lack of connection to his own approach to saving the south, I present this comment made during Sir Goldsmiths testimony:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;These thinkers were telling us&#8211;in fact I was at [Renaissance] with President Clinton when Michael [Porter] from Harvard was there and he was still lecturing on the comparative advantage, David [Richardo], and I just looked and said, yeah, the comparative advantage, that&#8217;s why BMW&#8217;s come to South Carolina. We have never made an automobile in our history. <strong>I mean, come on, it&#8217;s the wage advantage; 30 dollars in Munich, 15 dollars in Spartanburg</strong>;</p></blockquote>
<p>And that, ladies and gentleman, is the display of the disconnect of our thinkers in Washington concerning all issues.  The disconnect is the segmentation of thought regarding the mechanisms of relationships when forming a position on an issue.  Senator Hollings just laid right out there his selfish thought process.  Now, I don&#8217;t mean this in a derogatory way.  Read his book, you will see he always held in desire what is best for the people.  Unfortunately, the set called “the people” changes with the focus of the argument.  The mechanics of the issue is never seen as being the same at a scale unrelated to the scale of the current set of “the people”.  His desire to help his south (small set of “the people”) made him unable to recognize in his approach to improving the economy of the south, the same mechanical principles he was arguing to prevent in the hearings regarding GATT and NAFTA.  That is the selfishness unrealized by him.  He is anti-union still today.  </p>
<p>Returning to Sir Goldsmith&#8217;s testimony, these are relative to today:<br />
<blockquote>The reason why this time there&#8217;s been a recovery in indices and GNP despite very substantial pressure, downward pressure, on interest rates and facilitating credit through the banking system is because salaries, earnings, have either gone down or risen very little relative to the period of recovery. And that is the whole philosophy, is we can keep inflation down by keeping wages down; <strong>and we have forgotten the purpose of the economy, which is to enrich, to create a stable society, and to include the population, the vast number of people in active life;</strong> and instead we believe that if we can reduce salaries we can keep inflation down. That&#8217;s the wrong way around; we just forgotten what the economy is about, what its purpose is.  <em>(Can you say last 8 years?  Really, though it has been the last 28 years regarding interest rate decline, wage decline, inflation moderation with rising GDP.)</em><br />The alternatives are not just closing the market, becoming protectionist; the alternatives are not saying we are now going into protection and we&#8217;re going to isolate ourselves from the world, each one of them. The alternative is to have regional trading blocs which have similar economies so we&#8217;re not trying to make our labour forces compete with people whose labour costs 2 percent of theirs and thereby destroying them&#8211;but&#8211;and reducing their salaries and eliminating their jobs&#8211;but having negotiated bilateral agreements between trading blocs so that each region, each nation, imports those products that it needs, not those products that destroy its jobs.</p>
<p>Senator, when I was young I was taught, as we all were, that if we managed to create extraordinary material prosperity we would solve our problems. And we were brought up in the belief that there was an inevitability of progress: progress of wealth, progress of stability, progress of civilization. Well during the last fifty years, since I&#8217;ve been more or less an adult, we&#8217;ve had the greatest period of economic prosperity, economic growth in history. We have succeeded beyond our wildest dreams&#8230;And what has happened? Have we solved our problems? Are our towns more stable? Are our families more stable? Is there less crime, less people in prisons? Less people in&#8211;are there more people in permanent and noble employment? What have we done? We have profoundly destabilized our communities. <strong>We have done everything that was wrong in social terms;</strong> we&#8217;ve deracinated, we&#8217;ve uprooted people from the countrysides, we&#8217;ve shoved them into towns, we haven&#8217;t given them jobs; we&#8217;ve created ghettoes and underclasses; we&#8217;ve increased crime and drug addiction and family break-down&#8211;all this in a period of maximum prosperity. Why? Because we were only interested in economic indices. <strong>We forgot that the purpose of the economy is not just to improve the index; it is to improve prosperity along with social stability and social contentment.</strong> And GATT is typical of the economic instrument, whose purpose is to increase corporate profits; whose purpose is to increase gross national activity; and whose result will be the destruction of the stability of our society, a continued break-down in family life, a continued increase in crime, impoverishment and all the other ills that we are now suffering.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read that last part again: <em>&#8230;whose purpose is to increase gross national activity; and whose result will be the destruction of the stability of our society, a continued break-down in family life, a continued increase in crime, impoverishment and all the other ills that we are now suffering.</em></p>
<p>I think Sir Goldsmith was thinking in linear terms as to the increasing negative effects of the form of free trade being set up.  I don&#8217;t think he imagined the deregulation that would give a false sense of reinforcement to the “free trade” weakening of the foundation.  That business was able to shore up the crumbling base via debt against the social decline, just means, as we are now experiencing, that the crumbling of the pyramid will be of a greater energy.  That is assuming we can not shore up the breaking of the foundation such that it is a controlled falling of the pyramid.  Though, if we are lucky (fingers crossed, salt over shoulder) we may just engineer a solid repair of the base before it all falls down.</p>
<p>Can we broaden the discussion now?<br />Thank you.</p>

<p>How To Bail Out the Economy &#8211; A Less Wrong Way</p>
<p>Regular readers know I&#8217;ve had post after post explaining why a bail-out would be a bad idea and would not work, dating to long before the bail-out began.  I predicted that the end result would be the further enrichment of some of the very folks who brought us this mess and junior versions of the same folks who were too young to get in on the original crime spree, but otherwise, we&#8217;d have nothing to show for the trillions that would get spent.</p>
<p>The supposed &#8220;rationale&#8221; for this bail-out is to make sure that companies that are willing and able to produce goods and services that consumers wish to purchase are able to do so, and that in turn consumers are willing and able to purchase goods and services that companies want to bring to market.  The story line is that this can be accomplished by giving money to the financial sector, that sector of the economy that for the past few years has specialized in selling squirrel meat as fillet mignon.  Give those talented folks some money to make up the massive losses pulled off in the past years and they will happily loan money to producers and consumers, we are told. </p>
<p>Its becoming obvious even to the likes of Henry Paulson that no matter how much money gets paid to Goldman, Welfare, Queen &#038; Sachs and Citi and Countrywide and the rest of &#8217;em, the &#8220;financial system&#8221; of old is gone forever.  Compensating buyers of squirrel meat is more than enough burden on the taxpayer, but it seems we&#8217;re expected to make Goldman, Welfare, Queen &#038; Sachs whole for paying the exorbitant salaries of folks like Henry Paulson in the past, and the current and future generations of Henry Paulson to boot.  Clearly this is not only a very, very, indirect way to keep companies producing and consumers buying, its also adding a bunch of layers of unnecessary expenses.</p>
<p>So&#8230; if the goal is to stimulate production and/or consumption, why not cut out the unnecessary layers of exorbitant expense?  I&#8217;m not sure I see the reason for bailing out car companies, but say that was the goal for some reason.  In that case, the government could simply buy a $20K car for every single American, every single one, and spend less than the $7 trillion that&#8217;s been committed so far.  That&#8217;s well over 30 times as many cars as GM made last year.  Worldwide.  You could bet the car companies would tool up for this, and it would employ a lot of people, and it would stimulate the economy.  Additionally, we&#8217;d all have another car thrown in.  Sure, it might be a GM vehicle, but its still something, which is more than the nothing we&#8217;re gonna get from pumping it into the Goldman, Welfare, Queen &#038; Sachs black hole.  Heck, it doesn&#8217;t have to be cars &#8211; the gubmint could simply commit to spending $20,000 on something, anything each of us picks.  You could take your 20 G and spend it on a menu of American made options.</p>
<p>Preposterous, you say?  Inflationary, you say?  Jingoistic, you say?  Sure, I say.  Its a stupid idea and I don&#8217;t like it all.  But I think its a much better idea than the current bail-out approach, which I think is worse than taking (for now) $7 trillion and setting it on fire.  Giving the money to the likes of Henry Paulson&#8217;s former employer is simply rewarding bad behavior and sending the wrong message, not to mention preposterous, inflationary, and jingoistic.<br />___________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p>I just could not resist posting this latest <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081126122203.htm">tidbit</a> about the aging process:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like our current financial crisis, the aging process might also be a product excessive deregulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nearly a decade ago, Sinclair and colleagues in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology lab of Leonard Guarente found that a particular sirtuin in yeast affected the aging process in two specific ways—it helped regulate gene activity in cells and repair breaks in DNA. As DNA damage accumulated over time, however, the sirtuin became too distracted to properly regulate gene activity, and as a result, characteristics of aging set in.</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Too distracted&#8221; is clearly too anthropomorphic a phrase, but in a curious way, it fits the present crisis. But wait.</p>
<p>The researchers have added an &#8220;enlightening&#8221; twist to the idea of &#8220;distraction&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem for the cell, however, is that the sirtuin has another important job. When DNA is damaged by UV light or free radicals, sirtuins act as volunteer emergency responders. They leave their genomic guardian posts and aid the DNA repair mechanism at the site of damage.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Distraction&#8221; is now operationally defined.</p>
<p>The marvelous genetic aging metaphor is ready for completion. All we have to do is to define what is presently keeping the overseers of our economic system from paying attention to the real problem.</p>
<p>Once we thought of the world in mechanical terms; now the world of genetics is opening a new way of looking at the world.</p>

                                <p>What fresh hell is THIS?<br />When I first started studying Social Security in detail sometime late in 1997 I made what to me was kind of an amazing discovery. Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; then and now tended to be perceived and discussed within the deterministic frame of Boomer Retirement, kind of a &#8216;demography makes destiny&#8217; thing. Every Boomer who would ever exist was already on the face of the planet and we had reasonably good data about longevity improvements. Which seem to leave us with an open and shut case: more Boomer retirees living longer vs a declining pool of workers equals crisis down the road. Thus it made some sense to talk and think about Social Security in fixed terms of Boomers becoming eligible for retirement at known points in known numbers resulting in Social Security going &#8216;broke&#8217; (however defined) at specific points in the future. The result is that reporting on Social Security tended to use deterministic language like &#8216;will&#8217; as in &#8220;The Trustees tell us the Trust Fund will run short in 2034&#8221;. (And for those who point out &#8216;I thought the date was 2041&#8217;, well that is the point of this piece.)</p>
<p>But when you actually examine the numbers it became clear that in fact they were doubly contingent with any given Annual Report projecting a range of potential outcomes (your &#8216;intra-contingency&#8221;) while successive Reports could and did have a different range (your &#8216;inter-contingency&#8217;). In each case the objective seemingly fixed &#8216;will&#8217; starts blurring into the subjunctive &#8216;would (assuming contingencies A, B, and C)&#8217;.</p>
<p>Well what does this gobbly-goop mean in real terms? Well lets start from the following table from EPI. <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/issueguides_socialsecurity_changes">Changes in Trustees Projections Over Time</a> If we just look at the first two columns for 1996 and 1997 we are presented with just what we would expect from our deterministic model: dates of Trust Fund depletion remaining set between years with the cost of the fix going up. Open and shut case for crisis? Well not so fast.</p>
<p>First we can examine the <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/05/cost-of-inactivity-nothing-as-plan-for.html">Cost of Inactivity</a> on an inter-termporal basis. Not doing anything in 1996 meant the cost of the fix went up from an immediate hike in FICA of 2.19% to fix SS  to an increase of 2.23% or a change of .03% of payroll. But the flip side of that is that not doing anything had the effect of LEAVING 2.19% of 1996 your payroll dollar in your and your employer&#8217;s pocket in 1996 for that year. If we simply ignore the effects of current utility of that dollar, of current year interest, and of current year inflation we can calculate that it would take 2.19/.03 or 73 years before &#8216;Nothing&#8217; became a nominally bad bet for 1996. If we add in the effects of utility, interest and inflation we can see that each makes &#8216;Nothing&#8217; just that much more a good bet. Let&#8217;s say that you made $30,000 in 1996. 2.19% of that is $657 which given the employee/employer split means $328.50 in take home pay (more if you take the classical position that the real incidence of the employer match falls on the employee). It doesn&#8217;t take a huge rate of real return to make a diversion of that $328 into some other investment pay off; calculated in terms of risk/reward a strategy of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; made sense in 1996. That is in retrospect. On the other hand it would have taken a real deterioration in outlook and a pretty big boost in payroll gap to make &#8216;Nothing&#8217; a losing bet in real terms.</p>
<p>If we examine the remaining columns in the table we can see that &#8216;Nothing&#8217; turned out to be a winning bet both in nominal and real terms each year from 1997 to 2004, in each year &#8216;Nothing&#8217; left money in your pocket while the Cost of Inactivity actually went down, &#8216;crisis&#8217; steadily got pushed out in time and shrunken in magnitude. Now certainly you wouldn&#8217;t &#8216;know&#8217; this in advance, on an inter-temporal basis the contingency is kind of out of your control and critics might just claim you got lucky. Well maybe, but in actuality the numbers fell out as they did. And there was pretty good reason to expect that they would.</p>
<p>Why? Well it is the intra-temporal contingency. As it turns out the Social Security Report does not project a single outcome, instead each provides a range of outcomes with their best guess giving a mid-point Intermediate Cost alternative with a more optimistic Low Cost marking one end of the probability range and a more pessimistic High Cost marking the other. Now one can, and I do, dispute that the Office of the Chief Actuary has actually properly presented the range and so argue that Intermediate Cost is in fact too pessimistic, but for our narrow purposes today we can lay that aside. Instead we can just examine the first year numbers in terms of the Cost of Inactivity. If we take our strategy of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; and actual numbers come in in line with Intermediate Cost we can expect a positive Cost of Inactivity which we can then if we choose discount for assumed real interest. On the other hand if the numbers come in better than Intermediate Cost the Cost of Inactivity shrinks even before any discounting. And if the numbers happen to come in near the top of the range the Cost of Inactivity actually goes negative, meaning dollars left in your pocket with no downside at all.</p>
<p>Now getting back to the numbers. When I read the 1997 Report I noticed two things. One was that the 1996 Low Cost projection resulted in a straight out fix of Social Security, doing &#8216;Nothing&#8217; would produce a fully-funded Social Security system with no changes in payroll tax, benefits or retirement age. And what kind of economic performance would be needed? As it runs out only a future that more or less mirrored 1996. If the future on average looked like the immediate past we would be home free. But we did not need to make a bet on Low Cost long term, we did not need a crystal ball to calculate the Cost of Inactivity for any given year, instead we only need to look at the current year numbers in the newspaper. If 1997 underperformed 1996 but came in better than Intermediate Cost we could expect the Cost of Inactivity to shrink and possibly go negative (i.e. leave dollars behind and a smaller projected gap going forward). By the time I saw the 1997 Report the year was mostly over and it didn&#8217;t take a lot of bravery to predict that year end would look better than IC projections. And so it proved, the 1998 Report showed a payroll gap down from 2.23% back to 2.19%. And ten more years of Nothing has brought the gap down to 1.70%.</p>
<p>Which is why I laugh in the faces of people who claim I am being naive in claiming that Social Security is Not Broke. They imagine that I am betting long on Low Cost when in reality I am betting short against Intermediate Cost. Now as it turns out it looks like 2008 will turn out to be a least a nominal loser for me, we will see with the release of the next Report in March. But I am still betting that the real Cost of Inactivity by adopting a strategy of Nothing will prove to be a winner over the medium term and probably over the long term, because while my bet may be short term nothing is keeping me from peeking at numbers for the out years and the Inter-temporal contingencies are pretty low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>In any event there is no &#8216;will&#8217; associated with any projection whether that be short or long term. Each Report year presents us with new dynamic models with new intra-temporal and inter-temporal data sets which can only be properly evaluated using concepts like &#8216;if&#8217; and &#8216;if and only if&#8217;. The standard deterministic &#8216;Baby Boomer demographics&#8217; model just doesn&#8217;t capture the contingencies. And talking points that may have been reasonable enough in 1996 are stale, stale, stale today. A fact that seems to elude a certain subset of commentators here.</p>
