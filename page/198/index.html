                                <p>The latest Washington Post ABC poll has some dramatic results</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/post-abc-news-poll-public-sees-dire-consequences-if-no-budget-deal/2011/07/19/gIQA4MQPOI_story_1.html">&#8221; Even among Republicans, 58 percent see the GOP as too resistant to a deal, up from 42 percent in March.</a></p>
<p>In the new poll, fully 50 percent of conservative Republicans and “strong” tea party supporters say the GOP leadership is too unwilling to make a deal on the deficit. &#8220;</p>
<p>When they&#8217;ve lost the tea partyers they are in trouble.  </p>
<p>Also </p>
<p>More than eight in 10 — including 80 percent of Republicans — say there would be serious harm to the U.S. economy if the government could not continue to borrow money to fund its operations and pay its debts after Aug. 2.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if, had the question been asked that way, a plurality would say they opposed raising the debt ceiling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/behind-the-numbers/post/poll-taxes-beat-spending-cuts-for-debt-reduction/2011/07/12/gIQAnTOrOI_blog.html">But best of all, 54% of self identified Republicans want to soak the rich, that is rais taxes on incomes over $250,000.</a></p>
<p>Finally cutting Medicaid is the least popular option for reducing the deficit opposed by 74%.  You read that right Medicaid.  </p>

                                <p>I&#8217;m writing a few long posts—you&#8217;ve been warned—but that machine doesn&#8217;t have Internet access right now.*  So I&#8217;m just going to <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/should-we-care-about-price-of-gold.html">point to Kash</a>, who writes about something else:<br />
<blockquote>In looking at the data I was struck by how small (relatively) the worldwide market for gold really is. That means that relatively small inflows of funds into the market for gold could potentially have very large effects on the price of gold. And that in turn means that the price of gold could be very sensitive to a number of factors that have nothing to do with economic conditions or inflation&#8230;.</p>
<p>[M]oving just 0.1% of the financial wealth of US households into gold could be enough to have a dramatic impact on the price of gold. Note that the same can not be said of other asset prices that we care about; it would be difficult to discern any price effects whatsoever of a move of an additional $50 billion more or less per year into the stock market (valued at over $50 trillion around the world), the bond market (also with a total value in the tens of trillions of dollars), or real estate.</p>
<p>[A] good advertising campaign by gold producers could be enough to move the price of gold. Imagine that an effective, sustained advertising campaign, targeted at wealthy, conservative individuals in the US, is able to persuade 25,000 of them per month to switch a portion of their financial assets into gold&#8230;.Such an advertising campaign would have the effect of pushing $15 billion per year into the market for investment gold &#8212; very possibly enough to have a significant impact on the price of gold, given how small the overall market for gold is.</p>
<p>[A] very similar thing happened to the market for diamonds in the middle of the 20th century. The DeBeers diamond cartel used an incredibly successful advertising campaign in the 1950s to cement the idea of the diamond as the premier gemstone, and in so doing permanently changed the value of diamonds.</p>
<p>Whether or not you like that analogy, the central point here is a very simple one. Since the market for gold is so small, its price may be strongly affected by things that have nothing to do with the state of the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kash&#8217;s analysis—<a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/should-we-care-about-price-of-gold.html">read the whole thing</a>—should drive the final stake through the heart of the idea that, in the current economy, gold is anything more than <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/11/gold-standard-in-one-easy-quote.html">what I quoted Warren Buffett as saying it is more than a year and one-half ago</a>.</p>
<p>*In this context, does anyone know how to add the Windows Live Writer app to a Droid X?</p>

                                <p>It&#8217;s now two years after the end of the Great Recession, and the unemployment rate has ticked downward just 9 pps (percentage points) since its 10.1% peak. Pundits call this an expansion since GDP has fully retraced its recession losses; but the unemployment rate tells a very different story.</p>

The business cycle dates are set by the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">National Bureau of Economic Research</a>. The rates are indexed to the first month of each cyclical recovery for comparison, and the raw data are referenced in the table at the end of this post.</p>
<p>MORE AFTER THE JUMP!<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Spanning the business cycles since 1948, the average decline in the unemployment rate is 20 pps from its peak to 24 months after the recession&#8217;s end. In the &#8217;07-&#8217;09 &#8216;expansion&#8217;, the unemployment rate has fallen by less than half the average, -9 pps since the first month of recovery, July 2009.</p>
<p>In terms of relative labor market performance 24 months into the recovery/expansion, this cycle is the fourth worst &#8211; really the third worst since 24 months into the 1980 recovery is the 1981-1982 recession.</p>
<p>Technically, we&#8217;re not seeing a jobless recovery, since the unemployment rate peaked early on in the recovery (month 4); but it might as well be. Sticking with the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/">household survey</a>, employment (as opposed to the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ces/">nonfarm payroll</a>) is down by near 7 million since the economic peak and down 644 thousand since the recession&#8217;s trough. Yes, employment is net down since the recession ended. These numbers are affected by the annual population controls, but the trend (or lack thereof) is loud and clear. </p>
<p>The labor market is festering &#8211; we need a real policy response now.</p>

                                <p>Industrial production was reported to have increased 0.2% in June as compared to &#8211;  0.1% declines in April and May.  The entire gain was in mining and utilities as manufacturing output was unchanged.</p>
<p>The chart shows industrial production this cycle compared to other cycles.  The old forecasting rule of thumb was that it took about a year from the bottom till industrial production surpassed its prior peak.  You can see that on average this was a good rule in both mild and severe recessions.  But this cycle  some 19 months pass the bottom output is at 111.1 versus 120 at the peak.  Despite all the talk of the rebound in manufacturing is clearly weak compared to historic norms and the thesis that manufacturing is returning to its old glory days is at best unproven.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OU32rhd9wvI/TiBMUYVWlAI/AAAAAAAABrk/Tc2ibVhKTsc/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OU32rhd9wvI/TiBMUYVWlAI/AAAAAAAABrk/Tc2ibVhKTsc/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I also calculate an estimate of monthly manufacturing productivity and according to that calculation productivity collapsed at an annual rate of -3.0% in the second quarter.  The sharp drop in manfacturing productivity supports the idea that the drop in output caught firms by surprise and was due largely to supply chain disruptions after the Japanese disaster.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qU8B4ZcJmis/TiBQkmkjr9I/AAAAAAAABrs/IGGyjZ1ucic/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qU8B4ZcJmis/TiBQkmkjr9I/AAAAAAAABrs/IGGyjZ1ucic/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Even though industrial production is still about 10% below its prior peak firms are reporting that they are having trouble recruiting skilled labor.  I wonder how much of the supposed shortage of skilled labor stems largely from American industry shifting its plants to places like Mississippi because the southern states have low taxes and cheap labor.  If you move your plant to a low tax state firms you  can save money, but there is no free lunch and you get what you pay for.  If you move to Mississippi you have to draw your labor force largely from graduates of the Mississippi education system.  If you want skilled labor that is able to do a little algebra and/or read a blue print, maybe you should leave your plant in states like Massachusetts or Washington where they<br />have higher taxes, but they also have good education systems.</p>

                                <p><strong>Not Scarcity, But Surplus is the Problem</strong> (Just as Dismal, though)</p>
<p>by <strong>Noni Mausa</strong>, lifted from comments at Economist&#8217;s View</p>
<blockquote><p>They were discussing scarcity last week at <a target="_blank" href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/07/whats-the-point-of-economic-growth.html#comments">Economist&#8217;s View</a>.  But to my mind scarcity isn&#8217;t our core problem.  I wrote (and then edited a bit for this post):</p>
<p>=======</p>
<p>Yes, scarcity of resources is fundamental to econ theory, and it&#8217;s a real concern, not just an abstract factor for calculations.</p>
<p>But less often mentioned is the truism that human beings, working in concert, produce surplus. Generally this is very great surplus. In any society beyond the most desperately poor, this surplus is sufficient at least to support the 1/3 to 1/2 of the population who cannot support themselves&#8211; children, and the elderly and disabled&#8230;</p>
<p>This surplus &#8230; inevitably leads to the specialized class we would call the wealthy. This clan has existed as far back as we have written records. They may be more useful, or less useful, to their host societies, but they can only exist when those societies produce large surplus.</p>
<p>Economics talks about managing scarcity, but &#8230; our real problem is managing the surplus.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>Despite all the rhetoric and posturing we see in the media and in Washington D.C., it is safe to say categorically that the U.S. Treasury will not default on its debt after August 2nd, even if the debt ceiling is not raised. Not only will the Treasury be able to pay interest on U.S. debt obligations, but there is money for other essential programs as well. However, there will be some serious cutting that has to happen because spending clearly exceeds revenues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, quite. In fact, some specific numbers are provided in this column: federal spending would instantly have to be reduced by about $100bn per month. By the end of 2011 federal spending would be about $500 bn lower for the year than it would have been otherwise.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made this point before, but for numbers that large, anyone who wants to pretend to have some understanding about the economy has to think about macroeconomic effects. In particular, spending cuts of that size would reduce the US&#8217;s 2011 GDP by multiple percentage points. The Q3 and Q4 GDP growth rates wold probably be on the order of between -5% and -10%. Recall that during the recession of 2008-09, GDP only fell by about 4% in total. The unemployment rate would be likely to rise by several percentage points from its current level of 9.2%, to perhaps 15% or more of the US population. Recall that at its worst, the unemployment rate during the Great Recession only reached 10%.</p>
<p>So when you read someone blithely writing that the federal government will not default in the absence of a debt ceiling deal, and instead will merely have to trim excess spending, remember that what they&#8217;re really advocating is a new and deliberately caused Great Depression. And not just in economists like me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can it really be that bad? Well, <a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/fundmastery/2011/07/12/the-u-s-treasury-will-not-default/">yes</a>. This is what Marketwatch allows to be given their imprimatur, as one Kurt Brouwer presents &#8220;in a Q&#038;A format&#8230;what I believe you need to know at a basic level&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>If we do not raise the debt ceiling by August 2nd, we will not default on Treasury obligations. Nor, will we have trouble making Social Security payments. However, there would be a big drop — roughly 44% — in government spending because that percentage represents the difference between government revenues which would be about $200 billion for the full month of August and [sic] $172 billion for August if we start counting after the first week when the deadline hits. Spending is slated to be over $300 billion that month.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kash is right; that&#8217;s about $100B a month. So how does Brouwer solve that $100B+ shortfall?<br />
<blockquote>The [Bipartisan Policy Center] study projects there will be $172 billion in federal revenues in August and $307 billion in authorized expenditures. That means there’s enough money to pay for, say, interest on the debt ($29 billion), Social Security ($49.2 billion), Medicare and Medicaid ($50 billion), active duty troop pay ($2.9 billion), veterans affairs programs ($2.9 billion).</p>
<p>That leaves you with about $39 billion to fund (or not fund) the following:
<li>Defense vendors ($31.7 billion)</li>

<p>Oh, he doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Now, does Brouwer prioritize payments by &#8220;bang for the buck&#8221; (multiplier effect)? No. Paying interest on debt supersedes even the Social Services. If you&#8217;re looking to do as little damage as possible to your domestic economy (this is our government, not China&#8217;s), you don&#8217;t prioritize paying the interest on the debt (multiplier well 1; those people are liquidity-constrained in a way that coupon-clippers never will be).</p>
<p>And if you want to be a viable long-term investment, you don&#8217;t cut your current investment in long-term human capital (DoE, EPA).*</p>
<p>So what do you do, pay bond interest, or pay for parts and repairs on that military equipment that keeps active-duty military active? If you&#8217;re sane, you put troops on the line in priority over investors whose interest payment won&#8217;t be the source of their next meal or the protection from that next IED.</p>
<p>What does Brouwer say about these choices?<br />
<blockquote>No doubt picking and choosing who gets paid and who doesn’t would be chaotic. And, lots of programs would not get their funding and that would lead to plenty of screaming. Nonetheless, it should be clear from this exactly how much we are spending in excess of government revenues. And, that could and should lead to a sober assessment of what government can and cannot do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ayup. Government can, if they ignore Brouwer&#8217;s advice, keep Brad DeLong calling this &#8220;The Little Depression,&#8221; keep people employed, and set up future growth with trained workforces and people who are not starved into unhealthiness.</p>
<p>Or it can do what Brouwer wants, and pay bond market investors who don&#8217;t need the cash while soldiers die and people starve.</p>
<p>Mark Thoma should be ashamed to share pageviews with this guy.</p>
<p>*As <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/texas-jobs-engine-or-texas-jobs.html">Beverly&#8217;s post</a> notes, Texas notes that &#8220;beginning 25 years ago, the state began significantly increasing its education funding and therefore the quality of its workforce.&#8221;  Conservatives used to see the value of human capital development in creating an environment for jobs, and I still hold to that one.**</p>
<p>**Rick Perry has, of course, reversed this, so anyone looking to start a business in the mid-2030s might do well to avoid the Lone Star State. Unless, of course, everyone else follows suit.</p>

                                <p>Note:This was going to be short pieces about things I missed during a week of illness. It turned into a Very Long Piece riffing on two posts from <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/">Capital Gains and Games</a>. And that&#8217;s without even mentioning the bravura work <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender">Stan Collender</a> is doing there: see, for instance, this note that <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/2304/boehner-wrong-deficit-reduction-bill-revenues-can-pass-house">a deficit reduction bill with tax increases is very possible</a> if you just ignore John Boehner.</p>
<ol>
<li>Small Businesses exist in the United States solely as a vehicle for people to commit tax fraud more easily.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see any other realistic conclusion from <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/pete-davis/2298/revenue-raisers-arent-tax-increases">this piece by Pete Davis</a>. He tries to hide it, putting an idiotic suggestion with an Order of Magnitude&#8217;s less value fist, and mostly got people in comments to talk about COLAs, because economists are stupid that way. But the big number—$2,900,000,000,000—remains the big number.</p>
<p>The only proper conclusion from the entries after the first two would be that Pete Davis <s>can&#8217;t do math</s>is very fond of negative-NPV solutions. You could conclude from this that Pete is really stupid, but we know better. Besides, Len Berman of <em>Forbes</em> <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/leonardburman/2011/07/06/stupid-tax-tricks-and-the-debt-ceiling/">already went there</a>, concluding, &#8220;Pete, you know better, and you’re just enabling them.&#8221; The integrity of posters at CG&#038;G doesn&#8217;t usually get questioned so directly in the mainstream.</p>
</li>
<li>And there&#8217;s good reason for that. Andrew Samwick has argued for years that stealing from the Greenspan Commission&#8217;s &#8220;making Social Security solvent for future generations&#8221; fund, and I expect him to continue to do so, just as I will continue to argue that everything in the Greenspan Commission documents says that was <em>not</em> the idea. But Andrew has me worried—possibly in a good way—about <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/2303/right-analogy-wrong-timing">his idea of how to combine economics and family</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Actually, the government should budget the way families should. It&#8217;s just not clear that families actually do what they should. Both families and the government should budget countercyclically &#8212; their savings rates should be higher during periods of growth than during periods of economic decline, so that their consumption can remain steady across booms and busts. The problem that both the government and families are having today is that neither one saved enough during the most recent boom, and so both are having to cut back more than would be ideal during this protracted downturn.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now Andrew—who is younger and cuter than I—is starting to sound like the old man telling us to get off his lawn. Either that or he has just discovered that Lifecycle Theory of Economics doesn&#8217;t work so smoothly in reality as in the standard models. Or both. So it&#8217;s probably safest if I use that paragraph as a springboard to talk about Countercyclical Policy, Rational Expectations, and MMT (below the fold).</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The glory of Accounting Identities is that they must be true; the truth of them, though, is that there are many ways to get there. (&#8220;What do you want it to be?&#8221; is not just a joke; see Point One above.) So let&#8217;s start from an Accounting Identity:<br /><center>Y = C + I + G + NX</center><br />Now, Andrew might have argued—and I might have agree conceptually—that transfer payments such as Unemployment Insurance, Social Security, Disability Insurance payments, and Medicare/caid Prescription Drug Coverage should be counted as C, not G. But since Andrew insists that Social Security benefits can be cut without Social Security payments being reduced, he&#8217;s clearly treating those payments as part of G, not C.* So I will too.</p>
<p>Now, MMT people—as I think of them, the ones who make certain that only Kevin McHale can &#8220;spike&#8221; the punchbowl**—argue for Nominal GDP targeting. This would keep the overall risk-free rate (<em>r</em>) relatively stable*** since the components of <em>r</em> combined— π + i<sup>e</sup> —pretty much has to equal &#8220;5&#8221; at all times.</p>
<p>Given that, the expectation should that the nominal Y<sub>t+1</sub> should equal about 1.05Y<sub>t</sub> on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Several of you are looking up and saying, &#8220;Nu?&#8221; So let&#8217;s go back, then, to Andrew&#8217;s &#8220;all should budget countercyclically&#8221; claim and see what happens in a stable-NGDP, possibly-MMT, world.****</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s make one more assumption (not necessary, just easier for maths): at stable equilibrium,***** π and i<sup>e</sup> are both equal to 2.5: that is, 2.5% growth, 2.5% inflation. So, all else equal, half of the return on savings is going to be taken by inflation and half of the cost of debt is inflation. In an environment with no tax distortions and in which all lending is done sensibly and prudently (I&#8217;d like a pony, too), this is pure realisation of Modigliani-Miller: businesses should be indifferent between raising capital and borrowing, either of which is an Investment (I).</p>
<p>So assume that the growth rate for the economy—as a reminder, that&#8217;s the π portion—is expected to be three percent this year (it&#8217;s a good year). MMT would tell us that, to stay stable, we have to reduce inflation expectations to 2%. This means draining money from the system to reduce I<sub>sl</sub> (supply of loans) in the financial system. </p>
<p>(As noted above, at equilibrium, there is just enough loan money to go around. Since this is above equilibrium, profits will be reduced and businesses will have to raise I through capital, not loans.</p>
<p>Andrew would tell us that people in good times want to save more. This means that C should go down, relatively, which means that I<sub>sc</sub> (supply of capital) goes up.</p>
<p>Since—again, an identity—I<sub>s</sub> = I<sub>sc</sub> + I<sub>sl</sub>, MMT demands that personal savings rise to cover the tighter monetary policy. Just as Andrew wants. And just as is more possible in growth times than tight times.*******</p>
<p>So, ideally, I remains constant, if dI<sub>s</sub> = dI<sub>c</sub>. Not my favorite assumption, but a working one.</p>
<p>So far, in the boon environment, C is down and I is, at best, neutral. What about G?</p>
<p>Well, in Andrew-world, government is &#8220;saving for a rainy day.&#8221; Which means on balance that it&#8217;s trying to make more and spend less, just like the family. Which means there are two forces at work—(1) monetary policy, as the interest rate is tightened to control demand and/or reduce inflation, and either (2a) tax rates or (2b) spending cuts in some manner—that are working in the market.</p>
<p>I doubt 2a (tax increases) is the desired method of slowing growth (if you&#8217;re MMT-inclined) or stabilizing to equilibrium (which I assume to be Andrew&#8217;s goal). So let&#8217;s assume spending cuts.</p>
<p>Here those transfer payments come in. As the economy grows, UI costs are reduced. Let&#8217;s assume similar, smaller gains in other areas and stipulate that G declines in an above-equilibrium state due to a reduced need for spending—not &#8220;spending cuts&#8221; <em>per se</em>, but rather people being employed as growth comes.********* Best case scenario, fewer UI payments are made, debt is repurchased with those funds, future liabilities is reduced, and more revenue comes in as business expands—which is used to pay down debt so borrowing can be done more easily (read: at a relatively lower rate) during a downturn.</p>
<p>G declines. As Andrew would want, for good and proper reasons.</p>
<p>Which leaves NX. An expectation of 3% real growth is higher than the market had expected. Currency appreciates; exports become more expensive to buyers, who buy fewer. Imports become less expensive, relatively. dNX is negative (dX=0).</p>
<p>So with moderately higher growth, C, G, and NX all decline, while I either (a) increases slightly (in the absence of the need for and use of monetary policy, and not greater than C declines) or (b) declines (if monetary policy is used to reduce loan demand, since that pesky C<sub>0</sub> rather ensures that dI<sub>s</sub>c |).</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t use monetary policy to drain funds from the system, in which case (C + I) remains relatively stable or rises slightly, NX is more ambiguous (effectively=0), and G still realizes those spending cuts (paying down debt—more tax revenues at the same rate as business expands—which cet. par. increases the spread between <em>r</em> and equity investment and means some of that I<sub>s</sub> becomes I<sub>c</sub>, but that&#8217;s a side discussion).</p>
<p>The implications here, and for a downturn example and the full cycle model, are left to the next post.</p>
<p>*This should make it clear that this point was not opened with an <em>ad hominem</em> attack, so anyone who suggests so in comments—even on the basis of &#8220;well, I didn&#8217;t read below the fold&#8221;—will see that comment deleted. Assuming, of course, that I read the comments on a regular basis, so you&#8217;re probably safe, if warned.</p>

<p>A: The Gorgeous Blond(e). The other two are figments of your imagination.******</p>
<p>******Yes, think joke works better with &#8220;a brilliant violist.&#8221; But this is an economics blog, so live with it.</p>
<p>*******I would quibble Andrew&#8217;s statement that people borrowed too much for two reasons: one is that market transactions where the borrower is the one most subject to getting a poorer deal due to issues of asymmetric information hardly call to mind the <em>borrower&#8217;s</em> irrationality. Second is that many of those transactions were people &#8220;trading up&#8221; without clearly taking on a greater burden. (That is, $200K in equity on a NYC 1BR became a $200K down payment toward a home whose costs would be similar or lower, cet. par. The household balance sheet was not necessarily expanded on purchases. (That those purchases were at a higher direct cost than the available OERs is a separate, significant issue.) Similarly, HELOC borrowings that were invested into the property—all those effing marble kitchens for people who don&#8217;t know how to cook—are only negative to the balance sheet to the extent that they don&#8217;t have a reasonable ROI in the first place. That is, the deadweight loss is probably 30% or less on any portions of HELOCs that were used for Home Improvement projects.</p>
<p>Collaterally, if the HELOC was used in place of savings or 401(k) borrowings or other assets (for those who have same)—or even a higher-interest rate &#8220;bank&#8221; loan—as the method of buying a new car or other necessity, the fault lies not with the borrower, who made the rational (<em>ex ante</em>) choice to stay invested in &#8220;the market&#8221; and/or maintain Investments (savings).</p>
<p>In short, since all mortgages and HELOCs have been getting tarred with the same brush, we cannot be certain the extent to which &#8220;bad borrowing&#8221; was actually bad borrowing, or whether it was just borrowing based on the expectation that jobs and income would remain fairly stable—not drop the f*ck off the cliff and be reduced in even nominal terms for the survivors—concurrent with &#8220;investment&#8221; values dropping into an abyss.</p>
<p>Anyway, since C<sub>0</sub> is still essentially constant (&#8220;sticky&#8221;) even as income first declines, it is intuitive that saving is easier (consider the effect on S = Income &#8211; [C<sub>0</sub> + C<sub>choice</sub>] as Income approaches C<sub>0</sub>) in more prosperous times, on balance, for most of society, distributional effects being constant (or changing incrementally).</p>
<p>*********In such an environment, monetary policy may not be used so proactively. This should be fine for all, given that 5% NGDP is the target, not the absolute. Over time, it will smooth. I guess.</p>
