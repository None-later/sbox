I would like to see more information on plans for future &#8216;unique&#8217; storms and ways to handle some of the unique problems encountered by rescue teams, firemen, and aid workers.</p>
<p>Bloomberg, the Financial Times, the New York Times and other editorials wanted &#8216;to join the band climbing back on the wagon&#8217; so to speak along with some politicians.</p>
<p>by Linda Beale</p>
<p> What natural disasters like Sandy teach us about taxes and government, and why NY City Mayor Bloomberg endorsed Obama</p>
<p> Bloomberg announced <strike>today (</strike>a week ago<strike>)</strike> that President Obama would be the best candidate to lead the nation over the next four years.  See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/nyregion/bloomberg-endorses-obama-saying-hurricane-sandy-affected-decision.html?emc=na">Bloomberg Endorses Obama, Citing Climate Change</a>, New York Times (Nov. 1, 2012).  Bloomberg made the decision in part because of Hurricane Sandy, which wreaked havoc on the east coast, costing many lives and much financial distress.  Obama&#8217;s leadership and willingness to commit federal agencies to aid municipalities and people recover from the devastation was a marked contrast to the Bush Administration&#8217;s handling of Katrina and the utter disregard shown by Bush&#8217;s FEMA executives for prudent planning and quick response. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>There is a clear consensus among reputable scientists that global warming is underway and that superstorms like Sandy are one of the likely results.  In that context, a vibrant and efficient emergency response organization is terribly important.  Obama has shown that he recognizes this, in the way that he has handled the preparations for, and implementation of plans after, Hurricane Sandy. </p>
<p>Romney has amply demonstrated that he does not recognize the importance of government action to deal with natural disasters and similar emergencies.  Instead, he has suggested that &#8220;private organizations&#8221; should replace FEMA and that many other similar federal agencies should be squeezed down or even squeezed out.  Even in the lead-up to Sandy&#8217;s east coast strike, Romney was assisting with a gathering of canned goods and praising private charitable responses to emergencies, even though such action is not a very effective way to mobilize emergency aid. Further, as Bloomberg noted in his endorsement of Romney, Romney&#8217;s positions on many issues have shifted radically to the right in his attempt to win the election:  “ &#8216;In the past [Romney] has taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care – but he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the very health care model he signed into law in Massachusetts,&#8217; Bloomberg said.&#8221;  Id.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows anything about public infrastructure and natural disaster knows that charitable groups and money-making enterprises cannot possibly substitute for good government action.  That is the reason that so many in Haiti are still living in improvized dwellings and so many in Somalia still suffer from chaotic lives with anarchy rather than government as their norm. </p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s course is the right one.  He hasn&#8217;t been willing to speak as strongly about issues like the environment and global warming as I would like, because he is at heart a centrist.  But at least he knows that government can and must act in ways that private organizations cannot act, a truth that Romney seems incapable of acknowledging.  That is the reason that taxation needs to be increased rather than merely &#8220;starving the beast&#8221; to reduce the size of government.  Government is just &#8220;we the people&#8221; acting to do things that are needed that we cannot do individually or even through a business enterprise.  Government acting in those ways requires taxes to provide the revenues to support the activities.  And those things are not inherent evils, as the radical right today paints them.  Quite the contrary.  Taxation and government activity in support of the public good are vitally important parts of a sustainable democracy<br />.<br />cross posted and lightly edited <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/11/what-natural-disasters-like-sandy-teach-us-about-taxes-and-government-and-why-ny-city-mayor-bloomber.html">ataxingmatter</a></p>

<p>Yesterday I urged the Democrats to develop some backbone in response to the continuing right-wing extortion demands for military spending increases, tax cuts and entitlement program changes.<br />How should that backbone be used?  Not an easy question to answer and likely my answer will upset many economists and tax professionals.  So I propose that we consider going over the fiscal cliff.  What do readers think, and why?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the argument I think can be made.  Given that the &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; deal doesn&#8217;t require cuts to social welfare programs, it might be advisable to let the fiscal cliff occur.  Let the spending cuts go through and let the Bush tax cuts expire.  The result will be that we will have taken a much needed first stab at cutting back on the exorbitant military spending that provides rentier profits to the military-industrial complex.  And we will have moved the game back to &#8220;start&#8221; regarding the appropriate kinds of tax cuts to enact.  <br />But there are spending cuts that may not make sense (cuts to public employee pensions) and definitely some tax cuts (and programmatic stimulus) is needed to deal with the continuing slow economic growth.  What if the President and Democrats in Congress provided a clear and transparent plan for dealing with those issues by announcing&#8211;at the same time that they refuse to go along with the GOP extortion demands, that they will press for passage of a reinvigorated tax code and modified spending reduction plan.</p>

<p>In January, Congress can start with a clean slate and quickly enact [ah, I know, this is the weak point&#8211;can the highly partisan Congress change its ways?] a much more judicious (and limited) set of tax cuts targeted to those with incomes under $100,000 and to industrial policies that make sense for today rather than 100 years ago (such as continuing subsidies for alternative energy while finally ending the various subsidies for the extractive industries like gas and oil and coal).  That should be accompanied by additional reforms to the tax code to simplify it and eliminate unreasonable preferences that favor the rich.  Elimination of the preferential rate for capital gains should be the first priority (and carried interest should be treated as what it is&#8211;delayed payment of compensation).   Reform of the corporate and international tax provisions to eliminate the ability of multinationals dependent primarily on intellectual property to avoid taxation on their profits by transfers to offshore affiliates and similar problems in the tax code related to the globalization of business should be the second one.</p>
<p>Those tax policies would be enacted in tandem with appropriate spending policies:  it is what we want to spend our taxes on, after all, that should decide what our taxation policies are.  We know we need to raise money to repay debt, to build and maintain our long-neglected public infrastructure (highways, bridges, government buildings, high-speed passenger rail, etc.) and to fund needed research and education (NIH, NSF, Pell grants, etc.).   In particular, we need to address the infrastructure and other changes that are necessary to address climate change&#8211;both defending ourselves from its effects to the extent possible (surge protection for New York, for example) and regulating ourselves to reduce the amount of change.  We know we can and must reduce the demands of the military industrial complex through spending cuts. </p>
<p>What might Congress accomplish, if it would approach the budget of the United States from the perspective of considering what we should be doing to make this a better nation, a more prepared and educated people, and a more sustainable economy? </p>

<p>Health Care Thoughts: Reform Status According to Really Smart People</p>
<p>So after two days in rooms full of top notch front line experts, and two nights sleeping on a couch in a hospital waiting room, I offer a list of key take-aways.. This is reporting only, not advocacy. Some of my opinions may vary (not much). I avoid the nitty-grittiest of operational details. So&#8230;..</p>
<p>The amount and complexity of work to be done in the next 24 months is crushing and impossible &#8211; expect delays or sloppy rollouts.</p>
<p>Scale is everything, small providers will get crushed. Impacts on rural health care uncertain, so&#8230;</p>
<p>Consolidation and integration is the critical  path. Some bad outcomes likely.</p>
<p>The Obama administration is incapable of producing regulations and guidance papers on time (in Washington a little late is considered on time).</p>
<p>Providers are preparing cuts both permenant and &#8220;cliff&#8221; cuts.</p>
<p>The amount and complexity of IT work through the system is staggering.  Data is the new currency of health care.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Setting up the exchanges is a massive and messy task, even in the enthusiastic states. Letting the feds install &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; may become a good option for many states.</p>
<p>Some large public companies are seriously considering dropping health insurance and paying the penalty  (stunned me). No decisions yet known.</p>
<p>Winners, sorta in sequence:</p>
<p>Health IT &#8211; vendor companies and geeks<br />Health lawyers &#8211; transaction and regulatory<br />Health executives &#8211; the &#8220;talent wars&#8221; are going full blast<br />Health CPAs, finance officers and consultants<br />Physician executives<br />Nursing executives<br />Bureaucrats and regulatory</p>
<p>Losers</p>
<p>Physicians &#8211; mostly (depends on many factors)<br />Nurses &#8211; hands on care givers<br />Therapist and ancillary providers<br />Hospital support staff</p>
<p>Getting a child ready for college? Push them towards&#8230;..</p>
<p>IT, health emphasis<br />Health care administration<br />Medical records administration / health informatics<br />Medical coding (good jobs with 2 year degree)<br />Accounting and finance, health emphasis<br />Actuarial science</p>
<p>Private health insurers may be really big winners (oops). Some private health insurers are building primary care networks and ACOs.</p>
<p>There are some intesresting and even exciting geriatric care innovations morphing out of the Obama administration, academia and providers.</p>
<p>The &#8220;old elderly&#8221; are using huge amounts of Medicare resources, innovations may cut usage with the same or better care.</p>
<p>Hospital capital spending is going wild as a market share play, just what we don&#8217;t need.</p>
<p>So, now to plug through a thousand or so pages on operational and regulatory details. Did I mention the Obama administration writes a lot of long and largely incomprehensible regulations and guidance statements?</p>
<p>Interesting times ahead.</p>

<div>Every four years, the race for the White House ends in accusations of deceit. Each side says the other spent millions of dollars to lie and skew the outcome. This year’s post-election accounts of backstage calculations and fateful turning points continue that tradition. But if you read these accounts carefully, you’ll find a happy surprise beneath the spin and recriminations: Lies failed. Truth prevailed.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2012/11/_2012_election_facts_in_the_obama_romney_showdown_truth_beat_lies_and_spin.html#comments">The Power of Truth: In the 2012 election,reality overwhelmed pretense, gamesmanship, and self-deception.</a></i>, William Saletan, Slate, today
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Saletan goes on to discuss the several critical points during the campaign that pundits say are what ultimately led to Romney’s defeat, including the impact of Hurricane Sandy and of Romney’s appalling Jeep-jobs-to-China ad in Ohio last week.  You know, the one that said, “<a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/30/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-obama-chrysler-sold-italians-china-ame/" target="_blank">Obama took GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy and sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China</a>.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Saletan points to a delicious comment by a Romney fundraiser<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/life-after-defeat-for-mitt-romney-public-praise-private-questions/2012/11/07/4db3bc38-2916-11e2-96b6-8e6a7524553f_story.html"> to Washington Post reporterPhillip Rucker</a>—“A lot of people feel like Christie hurt, that we definitely lost four or five points between the storm and Chris Christie giving Obama a chance to be bigger than life,” a Romney fundraiser tells Rucker”—and nicely refutes its premise, voiced also by numerous pundits during the last week.  He points out that Obama wasn’t <i>acting</i>, or <i>looking</i>, presidential.  He was instead <i>being</i> presidential; he was performing his job.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Saletan’s article in mostly terrific.  But it—like most of the other pundit assessments—fails to mention the <i>actual</i> key factor for why Hurricane Sandy made it impossible for Romney to win: That the public learned of Romney’s primary-campaign statement that he wanted to remove disaster relief and all sorts of other federal programs as a federal responsibilities and place the responsibility for them on the states.  The very premise of this surely struck a large percentage of the population as nutty.  This ideology was at the very heart of Romney’s campaign, yet most people didn’t know that until a week before the election. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Sandy effect, in other words, had less to do with Obama’s “looking presidential” than Obama’s being presidential, as Saletan notes, but that’s because the public learned then pretty much what the difference was between Obama’s idea of what the federal government, rather than the states, should do.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Another important factor was, as this article and many others point out, Romney’s appalling ad last week in Ohio about Chrysler and Jeep, but I think the ad’s importance went even beyond the obvious problem that it intended to perpetuate a clearly erroneous fact.  Everyone in any way connected to the auto industry knows that Chrysler could not have survived at all without its purchase by Fiat.  Everyone who is currently employed because of Chrysler’s continued existence—including employees of Chrysler’s parts suppliers—knows that there would be no Chrysler, and therefore no Jeep jobs to be sent to China, or not—were it not for the sale of Chrysler to Fiat. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So the ad, in addition to being flatly false in suggesting that the Jeep factory in Toledo was being shuttered, made no sense.  And it made no sense in a way that everyone recognized made no sense.  The ad, although it ran only in Ohio, got lots of publicity nationwide because the auto executives’ stunned and angry refutation, and Obama’s comments in Toledo about the ad, were big political news around the country.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The only conceivable reason that the Romney campaign gambled by putting out an ad that so obviously could backfire exactly as it did is that they already knew they were losing in Ohio and were willing to try, literally, anything.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>These two factors, the hurricane and the Toledo Jeep factory, both of them coming in the closing ten days of the campaign, actually summed up the Romney campaign: mendacity as its prime <i>modus operandi,</i>and Tea Party ideology, <i>both</i> of which depend upon a concerted removal from the fact-based world.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I suspect that it will be a long time before another Republican presidential nominee tries either of these.  At least until he or she is inaugurated. 
</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Jim Manzi, curious as always (especially about how to evaluate government policies), <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/what-is-causality/257193/">tries to plumb the problem of causality</a>. Here’s where he begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>Consider two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#8211; Does A cause B?</li>
<li>&#8211; If I take action A, will it cause outcome B?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t care about the first, or more precisely, I might care about it, but only as scaffolding that might ultimately help me to answer the second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll risk going Manichaean here in an effort at (simplistic) clarity: I think this encapsulates a key difference between scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>Scientists want to understand how something works — not just “does A cause B?” but “what is the mechanism whereby A causes B?” Successful prediction is valuable (mainly? only?) because it validates or invalidates that understanding. Their main goal is to build coherent theory and understanding. Prediction is a happy by-product and necessary corrective.</p>
<p>Engineers want to understand how something works so that they can predict things — and create things that capitalize on that predictive power. They’re perfectly happy if they can predict successfully without understanding why the prediction works. Coherent theory is generally necessary to achieve this — they need to understand how things work — but it’s not their ultimate goal. Theory is a necessary evil.</p>
<p>An assertion of causality requires both. You need to show that B follows A reliably, but to be confident of causation, you need to explain — really tell a story — about how that causality works.</p>
<p>Both of these approaches are necessary and proper, of course, and they’re complementary. But I’d suggest that theory — the goal of science and most scientists — is what really matters in the long run. It’s easy enough to predict that the sun will rise in the east every day. Successfully predicting that yields many happy benefits. But <em>understanding why</em> — heliocentrism, earth rotation, gravity, momentum, etc. — now that is really profound. That coherent theory provides engineers with their necessary evil, so they can create and capitalize on further successful predictions.</p>
<p>With his “I don’t care about the first,” Jim puts himself squarely in the “engineers” camp that I’ve (again simplistically) described. Don’t get me wrong: I’m quite certain that Jim Manzi is quite curious and hungry for understanding (even while he’s skeptical about our ability to understand how complex human systems work). But by putting himself in that camp, he is aligning himself with, and providing aid and comfort to, a group that actively distrusts and dislikes egghead elitist types with all their fancy theories about evolution and climate and yes, economics. He aligns himself with a group that doesn’t really care about understanding, that just wants to know “which button should I push?”</p>
<p>It’s a group that tends to come up with answers like “Just cut taxes.”</p>

                                <h5>The GOP&#8217;s extortion demands: cut Social Security or we&#8217;ll shoot the country in the foot</h5>
<p>The GOP created the fiscal cliff beginning with the &#8220;temporary&#8221; tax cuts passed in 2001, 2003 and 2004 under the Bush administration, all as purportedly temporary provisions with sunset dates.  They hoped that the passage of the tax cuts would, as generally happens when people have more of something they like, lead people to demand making all of the cuts permanent.  The result would be a huge tax decrease for the wealthiest taxpayers, and a rather insignificant tax decrease for most Americans.</p>
<p>In many ways, their strategy worked.  Most Americans forget that they didn&#8217;t think they really had to have a cut in income taxes back in 2001, and they don&#8217;t want to pay more taxes than they are paying now, even a little bit more.   And the Great Recession means that for many Americans who are suffering deep financial injury still because of the housing and jobs crisis, every tax dollar saved is a step back to normalcy.<br />But the tax cuts pushed by the GOP joined together with the tremendous costs of the preemptive wars pushed by the GOP to create a veritable snowballing deficit. </p>
<p>Under Bush, we went from surplus in year one, to huge deficits the rest of the time (with much of the impact of the deficit hidden by the purportedly temporary nature of the provisions and the annual passage of an AMT patch that didn&#8217;t have to be included in the calculation of the deficit until the particular patch was passed).  Those two huge drivers of the deficit were treated by the GOP at the time as inconsequential, as GOP stars claimed that &#8220;deficits don&#8217;t matter.&#8221;  See <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/07/dick_cheney_to_congressional_r.html">Dick Cheney to Congressional Republicans: don&#8217;t stop spending</a>, The Oregonian (July 18, 2012) (noting Cheney&#8217;s current advice to keep spending on the military and retelling the story of Cheney&#8217;s telling then Treasury secretary O&#8217;Neill that &#8220;Reagan proved that deficits don&#8217;t matter&#8221;).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Part of the right&#8217;s goal, of course, was to use the increases in deficits that their tax cuts caused as a rationale for &#8220;starving the beast&#8221;&#8211;forcing the Democrats to accept cuts (they of course called them &#8220;reforms&#8221;) to the parts of governnment that the right doesn&#8217;t like.  That meant reduction to the benefits from, and privatization of, Social Security and Medicare and reduction of government employee pensions and maybe, in a far right dream world, the elimination of any federal role in basic research funding, disaster emergency responses, and education.  Meanwhile, the right would continue to push for increased spending on the parts of government it likes (military spending, for example&#8211;see Cheney&#8217;s July 2012 admonition to the GOP to keep spending on the military, above) and continued favorable tax subsidies for the wealthy and big corporations (carried interest, domestic manufacturing deduction, etc.) even if that continued to add to the deficit and the debt. </p>
<p>The GOP&#8217;s tune changed when the flagrant underregulation of the financialized economy (deregulation, of course, having been begun with Reagan and continued for decades now) resulted in the financial crisis that became the Great Recession and then a Democrat was elected president.  GOP lawmakers suddenly thought deficits were bad (when they were created by Democratic presidents to respond to crisis).  And debt&#8211;which had been spiralling upwards under the Bush regime with increases in debt ceiling hardly noticed&#8211;suddenly was a monster that must be contained.  And all of this could be used by those on the radicalized right every time the debt ceiling had to be increased to extort from those not on the right the right&#8217;s desired changes in social justice programs. </p>
<p>In other words, the radicalized GOP set the conditions in motion that allowed them to hold us hostage now, through their control of the House of Representatives, in an extortion campaign.  In that campaign,  they demand that they get the changes to Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid that they want (the so-called &#8220;reforms&#8221; to so-called &#8220;entitlement&#8221; programs that amount to the beginning of the unraveling of the New Deal that the right so detests) in exchange for their going along with increases to the debt ceiling that are necessary because of the irresponsible tax and spending policies that they pursued while in office or the measures that were necessary to shore up the financial system when it threatened collapse due to the deregulatory push that has gone on for forty years funded by and supported by the right (and some  Dems in the middle as well). </p>
<p>So guess what.  We shouldn&#8217;t be surprised at all to hear today that U.S. House Speaker John Boehner says the GOP rightwingers will maybe agree to some &#8220;revenue&#8221; increases so long as they get their extortion payments&#8211;concessions from liberals that will ultimately lead to the reduction and/or privatization of Social Security and Medicare and other government programs.  And of course this is double-speak anyway, since Boehner and his compatriots on the GOP right still ascribe to the frequently disproven  market fundamentalism that believes that deregulation and &#8220;simplification&#8221; (meaning tax cuts) leads to economic growth that automatically results in revenue increases even without tax changes intended to raise more tax monies. </p>
<p>As Tiron and Rubin note in the Bloomberg piece reporting on Boehner&#8217;s statements, his speech &#8220;sounded conciliatory and didn&#8217;t alter the Republican position on tax policy&#8221; but &#8220;marked the start of political positioning and negotiations over what to do about the so-called fiscal cliff of $607 billion in combined tax increases and spending cuts.&#8221;   He isn&#8217;t agreeing to tax increases: he just wants to be able to use the kind of  manipulative tweaking of the data to get the desired result called &#8220;dynamic scoring&#8221; that the GOP right has been pushing for decades as a way to &#8220;prove&#8221; that their deficit-creating tax cuts really aren&#8217;t costing anything!  See Roxana Tiron and Richard Rubin, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-07/boehner-would-accept-new-revenue-under-right-conditions-.html">Boehner Would Accept New Revenue under &#8216;Right Conditions&#8217;</a>, Bloomberg.com (Nov. 7, 2012)</p>
<p>Boehner called for concessions, stating &#8220;The president must be willing to reduce spending and shore up entitlement programs that are the primary drivers of our debt.&#8221;  Id.</p>
<p><a href="http://reid.senate.gov/">Harry Reid</a> (Senate majority leader) said &#8220;We&#8217;re happy to deal with entitlements, but we&#8217;re not messing with Social Security.&#8221;  It&#8217;s hard to know for sure what that means&#8211;maybe they are willing to reduce Medicaid and Medicare benefits? Too bad he didn&#8217;t say that we need to expand Obamacare to make it Medicare for all, so that we can get control of health care costs while providing much needed support particularly to the elderly at the end of life.  But at least he did say something that should translate to &#8220;we are not going to change Social Security.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the game is on.  The GOP intends to continue pushing its same old medicine of tax cuts for the rich and entitlement cuts for the rest of us.  I hope the Democrats have gained a little bit of backbone from the election so that they will push for wiser spending on public infrastructure and wiser tax policies in areas from estate and capital gains taxes to corporate subsidies. </p>

                                <p>by Robert Waldmann   </p>
<p>What has Nate Silver done for us lately ?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t really about Nate Silver.  It is about poll aggregators in general and just as much about the Huffington Post pollster, Real Clear Politics and Talking points Memo as about Silver, Wang Linzer and others who try to estimate outcome probabilities and not just average polls.</p>
<p>I think that aggregators have proven that it is better to look at their aggregates than to look at individual polls and try to see patterns or calculate averages from memory.  I think this means that their judgement to not include a poll would be damaging to the pollster.  I conclude that, if they work together, they can demand and obtain transparency. </p>
<p>I have a real problem with what I perceive to be a lack of transparency of pollsters. I refer really to the methodological explanations they have on their web sites.  I do not have the impression that I could reproduce their numbers from the transcripts of their interviews based on their explanations.  I do not think this is acceptable.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>My sense is that this is not just my ignorance &#8212; that pollster methodology is partly secret.  Here I stress that I might be wrong &#8212; it might be that the full protocol is not secret and I am just ignorant.</p>
<p>My understanding is that pollsters keep their methodology partly secret claiming it is a trade secret &#8212; that since they are the best pollster, all other pollsters would imitate their methods if they weren&#8217;t kept secret.  If they do make this claim, it is BS.  They make different choices and each is, as noted, convinced they are right. My guess is that they don&#8217;t describe the assumptions they make, because if they did then people would understand that the assumptions are assumptions and make a difference.  I think that, most unfortunately, most poll consumers are willing to accept a black box, buy a pig in a poke (and mix metaphors).</p>
<p>I think this is not a healthy attitude and that poll consumers including journalists should have a rule that no special sauce is allowed.  I have no hope that journalists will adopt this rule.  But I really hope that poll aggregaters do.</p>
<p>I note that academic journals have this rule.  They demand the raw data and an explanation of calculations such that they can be replicated by editors (doesn&#8217;t mean they do replicate them and doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t ). This is actually a fairly new development.  Editors of academic journals can impose such rules as their decisions are very important &#8212; basically research doesn&#8217;t count without their approval. </p>
<p>I think a conference of leading poll aggregators would be useful and that a decision that polls with secret methodologies are to be ignored would make a huge difference.  But I don&#8217;t think their power to impose transparency on pollsters will last.  Right now they have high status, because they totally out predicted the non quantitative go with their gut pundits.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that in 6 months the fact that they nailed 2012 will be old news which can be ignored.</p>

                                <p>by David Zetland   David Zetland is a senior water economist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands and maintains a blog on water issues at <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/11/hurricane-sandy-and-choices-for-future.html">Aguanomics</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/11/hurricane-sandy-and-choices-for-future.html">Hurricane Sandy and choices for the future</a></p>
<p>I live in the Netherlands, where living below sea level for many years has driven the Dutch to take flooding and storm surges very seriously.*<br />    <br />It&#8217;s therefore interesting to compare the damage from the storm to the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/03/us-storm-sandy-infrastructure-idUSBRE8A203G20121103">early warnings</a> that Americans had from the Dutch and scientists. Were the Americans right to have ignored those warnings? After all&#8230; &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/opinion/our-latest-high-water-mark.html">Hurricane Sandy was a fluke, right?</a> A storm surged from 90-mile-per-hour winds of a hurricane colliding with a northeaster, perfectly timed with a maximum full-moon high tide. The statistical likelihood of this is once in every 500 to 1,000 years.&#8221;<br />    <br />Huh. I guess the 2010 book on my table [pp 51-52 of Book II <a href="http://www.rotterdamclimateinitiative.nl/nl/delta_cities_website/documents">here</a>] is about 497 years early:<br />
<blockquote>Storm surges along the eastern seaboard of the US are associated with either late summer-autumn hurricanes or extra-tropical cyclones in the winter period, so called nor&#8217;easters&#8230; the height of the hurricane surge is amplified if it coincides with the astronomical high time and additionally occurs at the time of new and full moon&#8230; hurricanes have struck the coastal New York area six times in 1900-1990, resulting in severe coastal flooding, damage and destruction of beachfront property, severe beach erosion, downed power lines, power outages and disruption of normal transportation.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I visited with Piet Dircke in Rotterdam (the center of Dutch vulnerability to floods) two years ago, we discussed the problem of flooding, and he gave me his book (<a href="http://www.rotterdamclimateinitiative.nl/nl/delta_cities_website/documents">free to download</a>, by the way). He was also disappointed that New Yorkers were not interested in investing the time and money necessary for protecting their city from surges and floods. How was that possible when the CEO of New York was saying this?  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SP6gT6XXB-E/UJuyoDAJIiI/AAAAAAAAEGg/dKYxGBgkNi8/s1600/Bloom.PNG"><img border="0" height="255" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SP6gT6XXB-E/UJuyoDAJIiI/AAAAAAAAEGg/dKYxGBgkNi8/s640/Bloom.PNG" width="640"></a><br />Well, it&#8217;s possible because they were trying to avoid relocating people and neighborhoods or paying $20-30 billion for a real (i.e., Dutch-quality) system for protecting the area that would [p. 59]:** <br />
<blockquote>&#8230; stretch across from Sandy Hook, N.J. to Far Rockaway, Long Island&#8230; providing protection to the outer boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, additional northern NJ communities, Jamaica Bay and JFK Airport.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now it would probably have been impossible for New Yorkers and others in the region to build such a system in time for the (unexpected) arrival of Sandy, but was there any plan in the works? Not that I know of. That&#8217;s unfortunate, as the storm caused <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/03/us-storm-sandy-infrastructure-idUSBRE8A203G20121103">$20 billion in damages</a> to New York alone.***  <br />So what will happen next? The Dutch would engage in a ruthless triage &#8212; moving people away from vulnerable but poor areas while building up 1-in-10,000 year defenses for places that are too valuable to abandon (e.g., Rotterdam).  </p>
<p>Will the People of Sandy engage in the same ruthless triage, or will they make the same mistake as we&#8217;ve seen with the rebuilding of the Ninth Ward in New Orleans? That political decision to rebuild is a costly and populist gesture that is likely to end when the returnees are flooded again in the future.  </p>
<p>Although that mistake is possible, I am hoping the Bloomberg and others take the time to read this book (and all the other warnings and studies) and make the <a href="http://www.env-econ.net/2012/11/oh-sandy-the-aurora-is-risin-behind-us-1.html">right decision</a> to rebuild in safer places while leaving those who want to stay in unsafe places to pay for their own foolishness.   </p>
<p>Bottom Line: Climate change means that the environment is not going to be reliable and business as usual is going to get more costly. We need to learn a few things from the Dutch: (1) Be realistic; (2) Plan seriously; and (3) Spend seriously. Anything less is not just going to be tragic, but criminally incompetent.  <br />
<hr>* You may want to read my posts on the <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/08/dutch-deltaworks.html">Delta Works</a> and <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2011/01/learning-from-dutch.html">Delta Commission</a>, which addressed these dangers in the past and for the future, respectively. Read <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/05/dutch-water-expertise-does-not-apply.html">this post</a> on why it&#8217;s difficult for the Dutch to export their water &#8220;expertise&#8221; &#8212; mostly because the rest of the world faces water shortage rather than water superabundance.  <br />** They were paying more attention to redeveloping New York, since valuable real estate generates property taxes and flood barriers cost money. I just saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanized">Urbanized (2011)</a>, which has an extensive narrative on The High Line and other cool projects but nothing about urban defenses.  <br />*** As well as causing vast grief and inconvenience. People unable to use the flooded subways or tunnels <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/2012/11/02/nyregion/100000001880180/after-sandy-two-wheeled-commute.html">took to bikes</a> to avoid horrible traffic jams (as well as the need to buy gasoline, which was <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/annanorth/13-people-trying-to-trade-sex-for-gas-on-craigslis">available for sex</a>). It&#8217;s a gratuitous tragedy that so many politicians have embraced &#8220;anti-gouging laws&#8221; that prevent prices from rising to balance supply and demand. Some gas stations stayed closed to avoid angry customers (or offer fuel for sex!); others stayed open but had cars waiting for hours to fill up.
