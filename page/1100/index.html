<blockquote><p>On a seasonally adjusted basis, the CPI-U increased 0.6 percent in  October, following a 0.2 percent rise in September.  Energy costs, which had declined in each of the preceding three months after advancing sharply in the first half of the year, increased 4.2 percent in October, accounting for over half of the advance in the overall CPI-U.</p></blockquote>
<p>Irrespective of the increase in energy costs in recent months, inflation does seem to be slowly rising.  The following chart illustrates three different inflation measures for goods other than food and energy.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/infl_oct.jpg"></p>
<p>While the overall CPI gives a better indication of the price increases that individuals actually face, stripping out food and energy costs is useful to help discern the underlying pressures and trends in the economy.  And this gradual rise in core inflation measures may indicate that firms are indeed slowly gaining pricing power, which in turn may indicate a slow recovery in demand.  Though, as always, I must now add my caveat of wondering how sustainable such an increase in demand is&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Apparently the US economy has been generating substantial amounts of new wealth for some people:</p>
<blockquote><p>NEW YORK (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/11/16/pf/millionaire_households/index.htm">CNN/Money</a>) – There are more millionaire households in 2004 than ever, and they have increased in number at a record rate year-over-year. </p>
<p>Those are the key findings of the latest Affluent Market Research Program, an annual survey conducted by market information company TNS, which began surveying affluent households in 1981.  TNS found that there are now a record 8.2 million U.S. households with a net worth of more than $1 million, excluding primary residences. That&#8217;s a 33 percent increase over the 6.2 million households that met that criteria in 2003.</p>
<p>Half of those surveyed are retired. The number of millionaire households represents about 7 percent of all U.S. households.</p></blockquote>
<p>My guess is that many (most?) of the 2 million households that have just entered the &#8220;millionaire&#8221; category have been put there by rapidly increasing values of second homes and investment properties. (I am willing to be proven wrong on this theory, though.)  If that&#8217;s so, then we have the property price bubble to thank for this increase in the number of millionaires.  Will the bubble take away as freely as it has given?</p>

                                <p>Bob Somerby began his <em>Daily Howler</em> in April 1998 devoting his <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/h040898_1.shtml">second</a> and <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/h041098_1.shtml">third</a> editions to how the press fails to grasp the issues in the Social Security debate. With Christine Romans taking the place of Kathleen Hays on Saturday’s <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0411/13/tt.01.html">On The Story</a>, I was hoping for some wisdom but alas got:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you look at the numbers, depending on what kind of re-overhaul you&#8217;re going to get, basically for people like us and for older people it doesn&#8217;t look as though benefits are going to be cut. But our children, our grandchildren are probably going to have to see some sort of scaleback in benefits, maybe pretty substantial, 45 to 65 percent for children who aren&#8217;t even born yet. And you&#8217;re probably going to have to raise the retirement age. Alan Greenspan has said that several times, that you are going to have to start thinking about working a little bit longer…And plan to &#8211; you know, plan to last until you&#8217;re 90 because you&#8217;re going to need that much money. Don&#8217;t count on Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>The average viewer would think the Social Security system is horribly unfunded. The good news is that the very smart conservative <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2004/11/social-security-reform-in-blogosphere.html">Andrew Samwick</a> and and the very smart liberal <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/000920.html">Max Sawicky</a> are having a cordial and productive exchange over various issues including the solvency of the Trust Fund.  Andrew captures the (lack of) policy debate very well with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The trouble in this debate is that the people on the political right seem to want to lead with the personal accounts rather than the solvency issue (even though Commission Model 2 achieves both). My fear is that, in the process of making this an issue, we&#8217;ll get the personal accounts without restoring solvency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t get excited about measures of the present value of unfunded liabilities from now till forever because I think they are jive. It&#8217;s a way of ginning up a huge number. If you want to do that, compare it to the present value of GDP.</p></blockquote>
<p>I like this suggestion, which was taken up by the OASDI Trustees Report in <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR04/IV_LRest.html#wp267012">Table IV.B.8</a>.  Let’s do as an illustration, a back of the envelop calculation of the present value of GDP [V(GDP)] and the present value of revenues coming into the Trust Fund “through the infinite horizon” [V(R)] by assuming a Gordon growth model where V = cash flow/(r – n) with r = the discount rate and n = expected growth.  Let’s assume that r exceeds n by 1% and that Social Security receipts will equal 6% of GDP under current tax rates.  With current GDP at $11.5 trillion per year, V(GDP) = $1150 trillion and the sum of V(R) plus accumulated reserves (the latter just over $1 trillion is just over $70 trillion.  The hard part of any modeling exercise is to estimate the present value of expected Trust Fund benefits to be paid out V(B).  But I’ll cheat by using the Trust Funds estimate of the shortfall and assert a reasonable model has V(B) = $80 trillion.  </p>
<p>Using this back of the envelop present value logic, which should be familiar to those Wall Street analysts that Ms. Romans hangs out with, one could readily argue that if benefits were reduced by less than 15% today for all generations, the Social Security system would be solvent.  The alternative wold be not to cut benefits but to raise more revenue with the additional amount needed being less than 1% of GDP.  This Trust Fund deficiency compares to the General Fund insolvency that is around 3% of GDP.  </p>
<p>Even taking the lower end of Ms. Romans statement, she seems to be saying V(R) is only 55% of V(B), which strikes me as incredulous.  But maybe my back of the envelop is wrong in two ways.  Is she assuming a higher retirement period (longer life expectancy with the same retirement age) so that V(B) = $90 trillion?  So why would not a 25% cut in benefits now do the trick even in her model?  Unless her model is also based on the premise that V(R) is only $50 trillion, which might be the case if Bush’s fiscal policies are designed to divert about a one-fourth of the Social Security payroll contributions to paying off the General Fund deficits.  Of course, it would be nice if the financial pundits like Ms. Romans would understand these issues well enough to articulate these implicit assumptions as they make their gloom-and-doom claims about Social Security insolvency.<br /></p>

                                <p>Wow.  I knew that energy prices had risen lately, but <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm">this inflation report</a> still surprised me:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today that the seasonally adjusted Producer Price Index for Finished Goods advanced 1.7 percent in October.  </p>
<p>&#8230;Among finished goods, prices for energy goods turned up 6.8 percent in October, following a 0.9-percent decline in September.  The finished consumer foods index rose 1.6 percent, compared with a 0.1-percent increase in the prior month.  By contrast, prices for finished goods other than foods and energy advanced 0.3 percent in October, the same rate of increase as in September.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the sharp rise in energy costs is due to the October run-up in crude oil prices, which has since been partially reversed (see chart below).  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/oil_3.jpg"></p>
<p>So we&#8217;ll almost certainly see a substantial fall in November&#8217;s PPI report to offset this one.  The question is whether it will completely offset this one, or only partially&#8230;</p>

                                <p>As Kash <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/11/working-hard-to-improve-national.html">updates  and extends </a> what I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/11/michael-scheuer-leaves-cia.html">noted</a> on Friday, I have to agree with his view that Bush is “throwing the CIA into turmoil and potentially causing a large fraction of its most experienced staff to quit in disgust”.  Contrast Kash’s reasoning with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/13/opinion/13brooks.html?ex=1258088400&#038;en=1200c7d7b6677a9c&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland">this oped</a> from David Brooks:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush is going to have to differentiate between his opponents and his enemies. His opponents are found in the Democratic Party. His enemies are in certain offices of the Central Intelligence Agency&#8230;At the height of the campaign, C.I.A. officials, who are supposed to serve the president and stay out of politics and policy, served up leak after leak to discredit the president&#8217;s Iraq policy&#8230;The White House-C.I.A. relationship became dysfunctional, and while the blame was certainly not all on one side.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK – when David used my term “dysfunctional”, he at least conceded blame might go to both sides.  When I used the term, I was not trying to absolve the CIA of any of its problems, but I beg to differ with David as far as who was playing politics here versus who was trying to serve the security of interests of the nation.  Unless David thinks Saddam Hussein was an imminent threat to our security in early 2003 – it seems what he is really trying to say is that the President has the right to demand the CIA serve his partisan interests.  While that seems to be the real situation within this Administration, I would have hoped David would call the Administration dysfunctional as opposed to his tacit endorsement of this behavior.  </p>
<p>Also on another note, read his last paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not that it will do him much good at this point, but I owe John Kerry an apology. I recently mischaracterized some comments he made to Larry King in December 2001. I said he had embraced the decision to use Afghans to hunt down Al Qaeda at Tora Bora. He did not. I regret the error.</p></blockquote>
<p>Error?  What Senator Kerry said on December 14, 2001 was crystal clear but it also became the fodder of the Bush-Cheney supporters who lied at every turn to win the election.  Mr. Brooks willingly carry their water in so many ways.  This apology is too little as well as too late.<br /></p>

                                <p>As the Democrats debate the best way to react to the Republicans apparent victory among &#8220;values&#8221; voters, they ought to take a look at the work of cultural researcher <a href="http://www2.bc.edu/~schorj/">Juliet Schor</a>. Schor, an economist by training, studies work and consumption, with research straddling the fields of economics, sociology, and culture criticism. The values issues she studies aren&#8217;t gay marriage and abortion, but how to arrange things so that parents can spend more time with their children and how to help parents raise kids with healthy values.</p>
<p>Schor&#8217;s view on long working hours, from a recent interview:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>One thing that happens is that women who work more in the labor market cut back at home quite substantially. By some estimates, every additional hour at work in paid labor reduces unpaid labor in the household by half an hour. So, what results is either a dramatic decline in the direct production of household services such as meals and childcare, or overwork and burnout among women who are saddled with the burdens of both paid and unpaid work. In either case, I think that this trend has <a href="http://aurora.icaap.org/2004Interviews/JulietSchor.html">impoverished family and community life</a> in some pretty  important ways. </p></blockquote>
<p>There are many ways in which this kind of cultural research can veer into irrelevance, conservatism, or nonsense. It can heap blame on women for working, or on parents for not monitoring their children closely enough. It can focus excessively on personal solutions (like buying smaller cars) rather than public policy solutions. And it invites mushy analysis based on stereotypes rather than hard data. But Schor almost always avoids these traps.</p>
<p>Her most recent research focuses on the &#8220;<a href="http://www2.bc.edu/~schorj/consumerCulture.pdf">commercialization of childhood</a>&#8221; [pdf]. While marketing of children&#8217;s products was once aimed at mothers and often emphasized urged purchase for the sake of children&#8217;s well-being, such advertising is now less common.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Ads now bypass the parent and appeal directly to children. These messages often undermine parental and other adult authority, portray parents as &#8220;uncool&#8221; or out of touch, or ridicule them. (Coco et al 1996) Corporations position themselves as the sole adult actor who understands, relates to, cares about, and emphathizes with children.<br />
<br />&#8230;<br />
<br />Bypassing parents and marketing directly is now far more feasible because there is more children&#8217;s media?in the early days of television adult programming dominated. Now, in addition to Saturday morning cartoons, there are children&#8217;s television networks such as Nickelodeon, the Disney channel, Cartoon Network, etc. Nickelodeon has been especially aggressive and successful in establishing themselves as the representatives of the ?child?s? point of view, which it has partly done through what I could term a pervasive anti-adult bias in its programming. Direct marketing is also taking place in schools, on the Internet, in movies (with product tie-ins), through kids&#8217; clubs, and in other cultural institutions such as museums and amusement parks. Indeed, these are the cutting-edge venues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Her latest book, &#8220;<a href="http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/04/SchorLAT.html">Born to Buy</a>,&#8221; elaborates on these themes and also reports on survey research she conducted among fifth and sixth graders, as this review summarizes:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Schor finds that youth consumerism correlates strongly with alcohol, drug and cigarette consumption, emotional and mental health problems, poor nutrition and obesity. As kids are spending more time with video games, TVs, cellphones and computers, and less time engaged in physical activity, they are showing a deterioration in general well-being and reporting increased levels of anxiety, she writes.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope that Democrats serving in Congress, or thinking about a run for the Presidency in 2008 are giving her a call.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The gang over at Marginal Revolution reports that<br />
<br />
<blockquote>In February <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/02/good_news_our_s.html">we reported</a> on a new study showing that the stock picks of Senators, as revealed in their financial disclosure forms, outperformed the market by a whopping 12 percent. Insider trading anyone? Although it&#8217;s not clear whether any laws have been broken, Alan Ziobrowski, one of the study&#8217;s authors says &#8220;there is cheating going on, at a 99 percent level of confidence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The study is forthcoming in the <a href="http://www.jfqa.org/">Journal of Financial and Quantiative Analysis</a>. There are a number of potentially exculpatory pieces of evidence, however. First, to what extent is this driven by a few outliers who did exceptionally well (think John Corzine)? I&#8217;d like to see median regression, in addition to the typical mean regressions (median regressions are less driven by outliers &#8212; Bill Gates standing in a room will have an extremely large effect on the mean income in the room, but a much smaller effect on the median income in the room.)</p>
<p>Second, is &#8220;outperforming the market&#8221; the right criterion? Specifically, do the wealthy in general do better than the median or average investor? I think a fair comparison group for the Senate is a randomly drawn set of individuals with similar levels of wealth. As they say, it takes money to make money.</p>
<p>Third, Marginal Revolution&#8217;s <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/02/good_news_our_s.html">first post</a> on the subject, from February, indicates that the sample is the &#8220;five years to 1998.&#8221; This was the early heyday of the dot-com boom, and it&#8217;s entirely possible that excess stock returns caused Senate membership, rather than the reverse. For example, <a href="http://cantwell.senate.gov/about/">Maria Cantwell</a> and the aforementioned Corzine both ran basically as a form of consumption. Each had (or <a href="http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=us%3Arealnetworks&#038;sid=&#038;o_symb=us%3Arealnetworks&#038;freq=2&#038;time=13">thought they had</a>) more money than they needed and were looking for something else to do in life.</p>
<p>So I won&#8217;t condemn the Senate without reading the full paper, but on the other hand, Occam&#8217;s Razor supports Marginal Revolution&#8217;s more cynical take:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The <a href="http://slw.issproxy.com/securities_litigation_blo/2004/11/sec_considered_.html">SEC looked at the study</a> but, surprise, surprise, it seems that they are too busy going after Martha Stewart to have the time to look into evidence that our leaders are using their political power and influence for personal gain.</p></blockquote>
<p>AB</p>
<p>P.S. The Marginal Revolution economists are basically libertarian (they might prefer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_economics">Austrian or Hayakian</a>), so you might be surprised by this compelling <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/11/should_we_opt_f.html">argument against Social Security privatization</a> by Tyler Cowen. In a nutshell, all seniors know that society will not let them starve. Therefore, they will take excessive risks with their mandatory savings and seek spend the funds too quickly. Any solution to those twin problems will require more government interference and worse outcomes than leaving things basically as they are: welfare for the elderly. I agree.<br /></p>

                                <p>After Mary Matalin claimed on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6485241">Meet the Press</a> that: (a) Bush ran on a clearly articulated agenda; (b) that it was the Democrats who said outrageous things during the campaign; (c) that we Democrats demonized Christians and treat then with disdain and contempt; (d) we Democrats have a disdain for the democratic process and (e) we are for partial birth abortions, she touts “tax relief” as one of Bush’s accomplishment.  Mindful that someone might mention the large and rising deficits, she says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The deficit as a percentage of GDP is historically not just manageable, but below what it&#8217;s been in previous recessionary periods. So this economy is growing, 14 straight months, over two million jobs.  It&#8217;s a great economy, better than it was even in the Clinton years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, which is it Mary?  Are we in a deep recession, which is causing the massive and rising deficits?  Or is the economy roaring?  Actually, we are below full employment but the long-run projections of the Federal budget show large expected future deficits even if we return to full employment.  But give her credit for contradicting herself in just two sentences!<br /></p>

(To watch, go <a href="http://www.c-span.org/videoarchives.asp?CatCodePairs=,">here</a> and scroll down to &#8220;Sen. Bill Frist (R-TN) Address to Federalist Society.&#8221;) I suppose one could hope that by credibly threatening to end filibusters, Frist is hoping the Democrats won&#8217;t filibuster, making the certain to be rancorous step of ending them unnecessary.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the brave and fact-based writer at the Washington Post, Jim Abrams, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49035-2004Nov14.html">describes Frist&#8217;s position</a> simply as, &#8220;Frist also said [on Fox News] he is considering various options to prevent Democrats from blocking votes on judicial nominees.&#8221; Anyone the Post assigns to write about Frist on Sunday should at least know what Frist actually said, in a lengthy and detailed speech, on Friday. But that would entail the reporter actually listening to the speech, if not live then on C-SPAN, and that would be hard, boring, work. Better to just watch Fox, Mr. Abrams.</p>

                                <p>The Bush administration is apparently <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46580-2004Nov12.html">making great strides</a> in improving the quality of the nation&#8217;s intelligence, by throwing the CIA into turmoil and potentially causing a large fraction of its most experienced staff to quit in disgust:</p>
<blockquote><p>The deputy director of the CIA resigned yesterday after a series of confrontations over the past week between senior operations officials and CIA Director Porter J. Goss&#8217;s new chief of staff that have left the agency in turmoil, according to several current and former CIA officials. </p>
<p>John E. McLaughlin, a 32-year CIA veteran who was acting director for two months this summer until Goss took over, resigned after warning Goss that his top aide, former Capitol Hill staff member Patrick Murray, was treating senior officials disrespectfully and risked widespread resignations, the officials said. </p>
<p>Yesterday, the agency official who oversees foreign operations, Deputy Director of Operations Stephen R. Kappes, tendered his resignation after a confrontation with Murray. Goss and the White House pleaded with Kappes to reconsider and he agreed to delay his decision until Monday, the officials said. </p>
<p>Several other senior clandestine service officers are threatening to leave, current and former agency officials said.</p></blockquote>
<p>But really, who needs the cooperation of the nation&#8217;s most experienced intelligence officers right now?</p>
