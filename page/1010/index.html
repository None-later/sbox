                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;m preparing a few slides for a class discussion about the US federal budget.  In so doing, I produced the following picture of federal revenues and spending, excluding the Social Security trust fund.  Even I, someone extremely familiar with the details of the US&#8217;s budget problems, was slightly astonished by this picture.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/rev_spen_exss3.jpg"><br />Note: The projection for the rest of the decade is from the CBO.  <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6633&#038;sequence=0">This CBO forecast</a> assumes that Bush&#8217;s tax cuts are made permanent, that AMT is mostly fixed, that spending in Iraq and Afghanistan tapers off gradually over the next decade, and that non-defense non-homeland security (NDNHS) discretionary spending is sharply curtailed.  Unlike the referenced CBO document, however, I do not assume that Bush&#8217;s social security privatization scheme is enacted into law.</p>
<p>Two things stand out to me about this graph.</p>
<p>Even with the Bush administration&#8217;s probably unrealistic goals for cutting NDNHS discretionary spending, their budget plans will result in on-budget deficits of $400-$500 bn (roughly 3% of GDP) for the next several years.  And of course, this forecast assumes steady real GDP growth of roughly 3% per year.  Much more likely, of course, is that there will be a recession sometime in the next five years, which will cause the deficit to be much, much larger.</p>
<p>But the truly remarkable thing about the graph is just how far federal revenues have fallen over the past fifty years.  It appears that successive tax cuts, especially those by Reagan and Bush, have driven down federal revenues in a permanent way.  Equally important, it is clear that those tax cuts have NOT driven down federal spending; the only substantial decline in federal spending happened during the 1990s, following a major tax increase in 1993.  Yet more evidence that the &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/starve-beast-theory-revisited.html">starve the beast</a>&#8221; theory has the empirical validity of the Ptolomaic solar system.</p>
<p>Revenues have trended strongly down over the past fifty years, while spending has remained roughly constant (with the exception of the Clinton-era downsizing of the federal government). That, in a nutshell, is the reason for the US&#8217;s present and future deep structural budget deficit.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Jonah Goldberg reads another <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/02/AR2005120201816.html">story</a>  noting that Karl Rove may have been in more legal jeopady that Jonah has been assuming.  Jonah <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/05_11_27_corner-archive.asp#083838">protests</a>   that he now neither understands or cares much about this issue.  But really &#8211; when has he ever grasped the issues or cared about the outing of a CIA agent?  If he did &#8211; he have to resign from the National Review.  But this comment takes the cake:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps when there&#8217;s a coherent explanation that will change.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does he understands the whole purpose of the coverup?  It is to AVOID making this issue clear.  But anyone who has followed this issue suspects that Scooter Libby is falling on the sword to coverup the treason of the Vice President.  Yes, Dick Cheney could provide a very clear explanation that even Mr. Goldberg could follow &#8211; if dishonest Dick ever bothered to tell the truth.  You say that&#8217;s not very likely? Perhaps not &#8211; but it is as likely as getting an honest and principled discussion from the National Review crowd.</p>

<blockquote>Bush said November&#8217;s strong job growth was due to what he said was a policy of cutting taxes and restraining spending and pledged to continue with that strategy. </p></blockquote>
<p>Restraining spending?  I thought the rightwing talking points were supposed to blame the deficit on an explosion in government spending as tax cuts allegedly lead to Laffer curve effects?  As in the National Review’s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/kerpen_roff200512020827.asp">Phil Kerpen &#038; Peter Roff</a> who claim:<br />
<blockquote>The 2003 tax-rate cuts supercharged business investment, which climbed by 4.4 percent in 2003 and an outsized 13.2 percent in 2004. The 2003 tax bill was a huge supply-side success story. The bill’s provisions, especially the capital-gains rate cut, the dividend rate cut, and the small business expensing provisions, boosted the after-tax returns on capital and encouraged a sharp turnaround in business investment. With the budget deficit standing at a paltry 2.6 percent of GDP and the economy humming along, it should be unthinkable that policymakers would enact a series of massive tax hikes that could derail the good times.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does this remind you of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/employment-increases-by-215000.html">Greenspan’s remarks</a>, which were also covered by <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/12/greenspan_socia.html">Mark Thoma?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>His view is that tax increases alone cannot solve the budget problem because the size of the tax increases required would severely curtail economic growth. Thus, cuts in spending will be necessary. </p></blockquote>
<p>If large tax increases severely curtail growth via Keynesian aggregate demand effects, then won’t reduction in government spending do the same?  OK, this is an excuse to note another <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/12/budget_deficit_.html">Mark Thoma</a> post:<br />
<blockquote>For example, consider an increase in government spending. This is, in part, self-financing, just like tax cuts are claimed to be. When government spending increases, output increases by some multiple of the increase in government spending through the expenditure multiplier, and this causes taxes to increase. Therefore, an increase in government spending raises taxes and helps to pay for itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK – if the concern is short-term variations in output and transitory effects on the deficit, I could understand all of this Keynesian talk.  But if the issue is long-term growth and long-run fiscal solvency, Greenspan’s and Bush’s remarks likely have Keynes rolling in the grave (I’m assuming Mark is just having fun with Bush and Greenspan).  </p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/bg-712812.JPG"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/bg-708570.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>But let me give Kerpen &#038; Roff the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are talking about long-term growth.  What is the evidence that Bush’s fiscal policies have spurred investment via some supply-side effect?  First of all, the fact that the sum of consumption and government purchases as shares of output have risen means less national savings – not more.  Secondly, let’s check out the following graph of investment relative to GDP (OK, this was all one gigantic excuse to draw a graph) from the first quarter of 2000 to the third quarter of 2005.  Investment as a share of GDP is still lower than it was five years ago when tax rates were higher.  So the Kerpen &#038; Roff case for tax rate reductions leading to more investment does not quite cut it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/12/what_is_the_evi.html">Tyler Cowen</a> provides a more serious case for reducing tax rates on capital income by increasing other tax rates.  More on Tyler’s argument later.</p>
<p><em>Follow-up</em>: The Commerce Department’s <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">NIPA table</a> 1.1.3 is entitled “Real Gross Domestic Product, Quantity Indexes” and have as its index, 2000 = 100.  The numbers provide an easy way to see the increase in real GDP and real government purchases since 2000.  Real GDP has increased by 14.15%, which is not all that terrific for a 5-year period.  </p>
<p>Bush’s claim that government spending has been restrained seems to be a bit of a lie.  Total government purchases (Federal, state, and local) have risen by 16.15%, while Federal government purchases have increased by 29.68%.</p>

                                <p>The November Employment Situation Summary can be found <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">here</a> with the headline news being that payroll employment grew by 215,000, while the unemployment rate remained at 5.0%.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, the household survey suggests employment fell by 52,000 resulting in a decline in the employment to population ratio from 62.9% to 62.8%, while the reported labor force rose by 97,000 with an unchanged labor force participation rate (66.1%).</p>
<p><a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/12/november-employment.html">Andrew Samwick</a> provides more details.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10294472">MSNBC</a> coverage of the employment news included this summary of remarks from Alan Greenspan about the federal deficit:<br />
<blockquote>In remarks taped for a conference in Philadelphia Friday, meantime, Greenspan said he fears substantial damage to overall economic health in the United States if strong action isn’t taken to curb federal deficits that are likely to skyrocket as the baby boom generation retires. It is likely Congress will have to make “significant adjustments” in reducing benefits to future retirees, he said, adding that it appears the country has promised more than it can afford to deliver in Social Security and especially Medicare payments, given that health care costs have been exploding.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Dr. Greenspan that the deficit must be reduced &#8211; but why would he rule out repealing the 2001 tax cut, which he supported?  It seems his support for the 2001 tax cut was the first salvo in the agenda to shift taxes away from capital onto labor.  After all, his advocacy of reducing Social Security benefits means a backdoor employment tax increase since payroll contributions would have to stay near their current levels for his proposal to make any real dent in the massive federal deficit.  </p>
<p>The <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/12/02/news/economy/fed_greenspan.reut/index.htm?cnn=yes">Reuters</a> coverage of Greenspan’s remarks notes why he wants more of the restraint in the form of spending cuts and less in the form of tax increases:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Tax increases of sufficient dimension to deal with our looming fiscal problems arguably pose significant risks to economic growth and the revenue base,&#8221; he said, reiterating his conviction that the government should seek to &#8220;close the fiscal gap primarily, if not wholly, from the outlay side.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Excuse me – but this sounds like the Laffer version of free lunch supply-side spin.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>During Katie Couric’s interview with Mary Matalin, I learned three things.  The main focus of Matalin’s comments was an attack on those “partisan Democrats and reporters” who dare criticize President Bush’s Iraq policies.  <em>Lesson 1</em>: Matalin has an exclusive right to be a partisan.</p>
<p>At one point in her tirade against Democrats such as Senator Kerry, she claimed that no Democrat had an alternative plan for addressing Iraq.  I’m sure the sound was on in the green room when Matt Lauer suggested that the “plan” put forth by the President yesterday was a lot like the plan put forth by Senator Kerry earlier.  So let me get this straight – Ms. Matalin thinks that Kerry’s plan was really no plan even though Bush’s plan seems to be a cut and paste of Kerry’s plan.  <em>Lesson 2</em>: Matalin appears to be dismissing Bush’s plan.  If so, it appears that the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/30/iraq.poll/index.html">public agrees</a>:<br />
<blockquote>As President Bush launched a new effort Wednesday to gain public support for the Iraq war, a new poll found most Americans do not believe he has a plan that will achieve victory.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Lesson 3</em> has to be that James Carville needs to buy his wife a new dictionary for Christmas.  Couric asked Matalin about the Los Angeles Times article entitled <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-infowar30nov30,1,1170868,full.story?coll=la-headlines-frontpage&#038;ctrack=1&#038;cset=true">U.S. Military Covertly Pays to Run Stories in Iraqi Press</a>.  Matalin at first defended this practice by noting that Al Qaeda had beheaded people, which I guess is the classic change the topic tactic.  When Couric noted that these planted stories were “one-sided”, Matalin fired back that the LA Times called these stories “accurate”.  Here is the relevant portion of the article so you can judge for yourself:<br />
<blockquote>Many of the articles are presented in the Iraqi press as unbiased news accounts written and reported by independent journalists. The stories trumpet the work of U.S. and Iraqi troops, denounce insurgents and tout U.S.-led efforts to rebuild the country. Though the articles are basically factual, they present only one side of events and omit information that might reflect poorly on the U.S. or Iraqi governments, officials said.</p></blockquote>
<p>If this Administration had done even half as well at rebuilding Iraq’s security forces as they do in their PR campaigns, the troops would have been home a year ago (or something like that).</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader Oldvet provided a link to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-12-01-iraq-coverage_x.htm?csp=24">this news story</a> as to how the White House and the Pentagon are denying any knowledge of these propaganda stories.  I guess it’s the few bad apples defense all over again.  But Major General Rick Lynch is not denying knowledge of this – he’s following Matalin and blaming it on Zarqawi’s behavior.  <em>But wait a second – if the White House was clueless, then how did Matalin coordinate her spin with Lynch so quickly?</em></p>

For a public four-year college:<br />
<blockquote>At public 4-year institutions, the median price of attendance increased from $10,230 in 1999–2000 to $11,187 in 2001–02 (figure C). The median value of total aid (across all firsttime freshmen, including nonrecipients) at public 4-year institutions increased from $2,946 in 1999–2000 to $3,554 in 2001–02. The median value of total grants increased, but not meaningfully. The median percentage changes in aid over the 3-year period were higher than median percentage change in price of attendance: a median of 20 percent increase for total grants and 14 percent increase for total aid, compared to a median of 10 percent increase for price of attendance (table 4). The median percentage increases for both price of attendance and aid were higher than inflation over the 3-year period, which was about 5 percent.  Together, the changes in price of attendance and in financial aid impacted the median net prices of public 4-year institutions. Median net price (all aid) increased from $7,216 in 1999–2000 to $7,712 in 2001–02; median net price (grants) increased from $8,463 to $9,056 (table 4). The median percentage changes in both types of net price over the 3-year period were lower than the median percentage change in price of attendance. In other words, increases in financial aid made it possible for net prices to increase at a slower rate than the price of attendance (sticker price) at public 4-year institutions.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The median price of attendance for private not-for-profit, 4-year institutions increased from $20,157 in 1999–2000 to $22,259 in 2001–02 (figure D). Across all first-time freshmen, including nonrecipients, the median total aid at private not-for-profit, 4-year institutions increased from $8,425 in 1999–2000 to $9,280 in 2001–02, while the median value of total grants increased from $5,862 to $6,747. The median percentage change in total grants over the 3-year period, an 11 percent increase, was higher than the median percentage change in price of attendance, a 10 percent increase; both of these percentage increases were higher than the rate of inflation, a 5 percent increase (table 9). The changes in price of attendance and in<br />financial aid were reflected in changes in the median net prices of private not-for-profit, 4-year institutions. Median net price (all aid) increased from $11,400 in 1999–2000 to $12,514 in 2001–02; median net price (grants) increased from $13,762 to $14,954.</p></blockquote>
<p>The executive summary continues discussing 2-year institutions as well.  Steve provides this summary:<br />
<blockquote>It makes the rather obvious point that it is much more useful to think about the affordability of higher education in terms of what students actually pay, rather than what the headline prices are. For private, 4 year institutions, the headline price for a year of education is $22, 259, but the median price actually paid is $14,954 (for 2001-2). Interestingly (p.53), there is more discounting for institutions characterized as &#8220;moderately selective&#8221; than there is for those that are &#8220;very selective.&#8221; Overall, there is less inflation in &#8220;net prices&#8221; than there is in sticker prices, which suggests that universities are sticking it to those with the greatest willingness to pay and the least bargaining power (that is, likelihood of going somewhere else), and redistributing it to those with the least willingness to pay and the most bargaining power.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, price discrimination.  But if this is price discrimination that favors those with the least ability to pay (yes, that’s not necessarily the same as least willingness), this would be the kind of price discrimination that a ProGrowthLiberal might endorse.</p>

                                <p>The quarterly estimate of housing prices around the country was released this morning by <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/index.asp">OFHEO</a>.  From their <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/3q05hpi.pdf">press release</a>:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON, D.C. – Average U.S. home prices increased 12.02 percent year over year from the third quarter of 2004 through the third quarter of 2005. This represents a two percentage point decline from the previous four-quarter appreciation rate of approximately 14 percent. Appreciation for the most recent quarter was 2.86 percent. The figures were released today by OFHEO Acting Director Stephen A. Blumenthal, as part of the House Price Index (HPI), a quarterly report analyzing housing price appreciation trends.</p>
<p>“Appreciation rates in the third quarter were extremely strong, although some deceleration can be seen in a number of the faster-appreciating markets,” said OFHEO Chief Economist Patrick Lawler. “Price momentum in the Pacific and New England states, in particular, has pulled back.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As I&#8217;ve written before, I think it&#8217;s fairly meaningless to talk about national house prices, as housing markets are quintessentially local.  Looking at individual markets, it seems that prices in some continued to boom.  But those markets that were the first to experience the surge in housing prices are now clearly indicating that they&#8217;ve reached the end of the boom.  The chart below illustrates.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/ofheo_dec05.jpg"></p>
<p>Markets that began the big run-up in prices a bit later, like Miami, Phoenix, and Seattle, are not yet showing signs that their appreciations are ending&#8230; but presumably they will within a couple more quarters. </p>
<p>The big question will not be answered for a while yet, however: how far will the lines in the chart above fall?  Will they stabilize at 5-10%?  Will they go to zero?  Or will house price changes follow the pattern of previous price surges, and actually turn negative?  The following chart shows what happened in these same &#8216;hot&#8217; markets the last time that there was a major price appreciation, in the late 1980s.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/ofheo_dec05b.jpg"><br />(Note: price changes are in nominal terms.)</p>
<p>To see how far the appreciation rates will fall we will of course have to wait another year or two.  But I have heard no convincing argument to suggest why the end of the house price surge this time will be any different from the last time around.</p>

<blockquote>If former President Clinton had overseen this economy, he’d have held daily Rose Garden news conferences to mark the occasion … Real GDP has grown at 3 percent or better for ten straight quarters, averaging 4.1 percent at an annual rate for the best performance since the middle 1980s.</p></blockquote>
<p>If one looks at NIPA table 1.1.1 provided <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">here</a> and take the arithmetic average of real GDP growth from 2003QII to 20005III – one sees this 4.1%.  But do the same for 1997QIII to 1999IV and one gets 4.5%.  And yes, Bill Clinton did oversee this economy.</p>

                                <p>Senator Schumer is stunned that <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10265262">Samuel Alito</a> wishes to chip away at a woman’s right to choose:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON &#8211; As a Reagan administration lawyer in 1985, Samuel Alito made clear his hope that the Supreme Court would one day overturn a landmark ruling that established abortion rights. But Alito, now a Supreme Court nominee, argued against an all-out assault on the Roe v. Wade ruling, fearing such an assault would fail. Instead, he recommended a policy of “mitigating its effects” by trying to persuade justices to accept state regulations on abortions … Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the memo “stunning.” “These latest revelations cast serious doubt on whether Judge Alito can be at all objective on the right to privacy and a woman’s right to choose,” Schumer said.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I agree with Senator Schumer’s concerns, such curtailments may <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10266151">occur</a> even if the Senate rejects Alito’s nomination:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON &#8211; The news in Wednesday’s Supreme Court argument over New Hampshire&#8217;s parental notification abortion law was that the John Roberts era may be one in which the right to get an abortion is further curtailed.  At least at first blush, Roberts &#8211; hearing his first case as chief justice on abortion restrictions &#8211; seemed to be trying hard to save the New Hampshire law from being declared unconstitutional, as it was by two lower courts. What was perhaps even more important was that Justices Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O’Connor &#8211; both of whom back abortion rights in general &#8211; also hinted that they, too, would try hard to salvage the New Hampshire law.</p></blockquote>
