<p><strong>Crisis in public education</strong></p>
<p>School districts around the country have been hit with a triple whammy of cuts to their funding this year&#8230;</p>
<p>First, the direct aid in the form of federal ARRA has run its course, so they&#8217;re no longer receiving that supplement. </p>
<p>Second, the states have budgetary problems for the same recession-related reasons that federal revenues have declined, and as a result a significant number of them have cut their funds for education and local governments&#8230;</p>
<p>Third and most recently, the decline in housing &#038; commercial property values accompanying the bubble bursting has started to translate into declining property tax revenues&#8230;but even last year, while school districts were supposed to be getting direct aid from the federal stimulus, I was seeing about a half dozen articles a week from districts around the country where cutbacks to their educational programs were being made&#8230;this year, now that federal aid has been cut off, the problem seems to have gotten worse&#8230;</p>
<p>According to the recent BLS <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Employment Situation Summary</a>,  local governments have lost 416000 jobs since an employment peak in September 2008&#8230;.from what I&#8217;ve observed, it seems the lions share of those job losses have resulted from school district cutbacks&#8230;but it&#8217;s not normally a national story; typically, its a local news story, where upset parents show up at the school board meeting and each district cuts something different; some cut teachers, some spec ed, some cut sports, or art &#038; music, or field trips, still others have cut over a month off the school year&#8230;so im going to try to tell this larger story with links to a number of small ones which have appeared since the beginning of the year&#8230;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p>There was a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/education/07education.html">brief media flurry</a> this recent december when students from the US scored 17th on the OECD&#8221;s standardized PISA tests (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;source=web&#038;cd=4&#038;ved=0CC8QFjAD&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnces.ed.gov%2Fsurveys%2Fpisa%2F&#038;ei=nUajTdzlGsXcgQf__KjkBQ&#038;usg=AFQjCNE9MLOiYpda26m0X1bjGeTqEKy-XQ">Program for International Student Assessment), </a>a test where 15 year old students from <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/12/46643496.pdf">Shanghai, Korea, Finland, Hong Kong &#038; Singapore ran away with the honors</a>, and the US got trounced in math&#8230; there were a few calls for education reform, and a <a href="http://www.mcgraw-hillresearchfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/pisa-intl-competitiveness.pdf">mcgraw hill study</a> showed that in the high achieving educational systems it was &#8220;<i>a tremendous honor to be a teacher, and teachers are afforded a status comparable to what doctors, lawyers and other highly regarded professionals enjoy in the US</i>&#8220;; but for the most part the temporary urgency was overshadowed by concern for holiday retail sales..</p>
<p>T^hen, as the year ended, the <a href="http://www.edtrust.org/">Education Trust</a> issued a report indicating that <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175337/tomgram:_william_astore,_we%27re_number_one_%28in_self-promotion%29/#more">nearly a quarter of all applicants to the Armed Forces</a>, despite having a high-school diploma, <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-22/us/army.extrance.exam_1_entrance-exam-science-and-reading-tests-scores?_s=PM:US">can’t pass</a> the necessary military entrance exam; not having “the reading, mathematics, science, and problem-solving abilities” to become a private in the U.S. Army&#8230;it wasnt until the state of the union, when <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/25/state-of-the-union-2011-obama-education_n_814039.html">obama invoked the &#8220;sputnik challenge&#8221; metaphor</a>, that education was again in the spotlight&#8230;and even ben bernanke got into the act in early march, when <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/bernanke-for-early-childhood-education/">he waded into the state &#038; local budget debates</a> with a speech stressing the need for a competitive high-quality workforce,  lauding the benefits of early childhood education in achieving that  goal&#8230;but for all the official oratory, not a program has been introduced, and as you’ll see below, further cuts have continued&#8230; </p>

In parks. In shelters. On the sofas of generous relatives or friends.  They are the more than 1.3 million homeless children nationwide.  Of that total, more than 21,000 live in Washington state, according to numbers submitted to the federal government this past week.  According to the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, the numbers show that during the 2009-10, the state reported 21,826 homeless students</p>

He said $18 billion in education cuts over the past three years have caused thousands of layoffs, increased class sizes, shortened school years in many districts and eliminated or reduced programs such as libraries, art and music. He said 174 of the state&#8217;s 1,077 school districts are in financial distress, signaling they may not be able to pay their bills in the next three years</p>

Of those, 400 would like be faculty cuts, according to data being presented this morning to the UNC system&#8217;s Board of Governors. After several years of budget cuts, the system appears ready to reduce its budget again, doing its part to help the state patch a hole in its budget estimated now at more than $3.5 billion. A 10 percent cut would more than double those job eliminations &#8211; to 2,000 positions across the UNC system, including 1,000 professor slots. </p>

What he doesn&#8217;t see is that real numbers affect real people.&#8221; For Rapid City, 10 percent means $7 million.&#8221;There&#8217;s no way we can salvage $7 million in the general fund.”</p>

The numbers keep getting worse. A month ago, Superintendent Michael Hinojosa thought <a href="http://topics.dallasnews.com/topic/Dallas_Independent_School_District">Dallas ISD</a> might be out $120 million each of the next two school years. The city of Dallas had two mandatory furlough days in 2009, which saved the city $2.6 million. Trustee Nancy Bingham said this afternoon she favors furloughs because employees wouldn&#8217;t lose their jobs. </p>

The decision was based on<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/47468216/AISD-board-meeting-material-Budget-Options-to-Close-FY2012-Gap-1"> a plan</a> to reduce the $113 million projected budget gap without cutting full day pre-K.  But all those plans could go out the window depending on how the legislature decides to distribute cuts to education funding. At issue is how lawmakers go about defunding education.  </p>

If the proposed layoffs are made final by summer, the ensuing teacher cuts would mean a minimum class size increase of five students in kindergarten, first, second and third grades. The increase would lead to 30-students classes in those grades. Classes in grades sixth through 12th grade would increase by two students to 34 students per class. </p>

Some programs, such as summer school or programs for the gifted, could be scaled back. And new textbooks could wait a year. All of those are options as Omaha Public Schools look to make budget cuts next school year. District administrators are seeking to make cuts totaling $22.2 million, including $11.1 million from programs funded by federal stimulus money that runs out after this year. Teachers, school board members and administrators say the list is intended to ignite discussions with the public and OPS staff about where to make cuts. “There&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s off the table at this point,” </p>

Tom Corbett is swinging the budget axe at public schools.  Schools may lose up $1 billion in state aid in the coming school year, setting up one of three scenarios.  Homeowners could see substantial property tax increases.  School boards may slash programs and jobs in the coming school year.  Or families may take a hit to their wallets and still see school programs or jobs wiped out. How big is a $1 billion loss? It amounts to about a fifth of the $5.1 billion that the state budgeted for basic education this year.  </p>

If the governor proposes a $1 billion cut and the Legislature approves it, the mayor estimated the city would be forced to cut 15,000 teachers, most of which would be accomplished through layoffs. That&#8217;s on top of plans, outlined by the mayor in November, to cut 6,166 teachers in the fiscal year beginning July 1.</p>

The board will vote Tuesday on the warning notices, which by state law must be sent by March 15. The notices do not mean that all employees who receive them will lose their jobs on June 30. The exact number of layoffs will depend on whether voters approve state budget balancing measures on the ballot in June. </p>

The study, done by the New York State School Board Association, estimates that Nassau County will have to lose more than 1,500 teacher positions while Suffolk County will need to cut more than 1,800. The study credits the governor’s proposed cap on property taxes and <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/02/02/gov-cuomo-strikes-first-at-ny-special-interests/">a reduction in school aid</a> for the probable cause of the layoffs. </p>

There will also be reductions to elementary school busing and transportation. The board voted a few weeks ago to close two elementary schools and cut an addition $27 million. The LBUSD has cut more than $200 million since 2008, and studies suggest that things are not likely to improve any time soon. </p>

Chief Financial Officer Nicole Conley-Abram told trustees Monday that the proposed cuts would increase class sizes at elementary schools, require secondary teachers to teach 174 students a day, cut athletic spending by 5 percent and, pending state approval, mandate two-day unpaid furloughs for district workers. </p>

Early projections for the 2011-2012 school year show an excess of expenses over revenues of $5,328,329.Mr. Dixon explained the key factors driving the projected deficit. On the revenue side, an estimated drop in students from 5,582 to 5,518 would decrease revenue by $371,840. The loss of federal funding (from ARRA and Edujobs federal sources) is projected to total $1,774,213 in decreased revenue compared to the current school year. On the expense side, rising retirement costs present a significant financial burden to the district. </p>

The schools will be shuttered over the next four years, causing class sizes to bulge to 60. The plan, mandated by state education officials, will reduce the number of schools in the district from 142 to 72. Robert Bobb, the district&#8217;s emergency financial manager, said he doesn&#8217;t think the plan will be effective because it&#8217;s likely to drive students out of the district, making the fiscal crisis worse. </p>

In an e-mail sent to all teachers and School Department staff, Brady said, “We are forced to take this precautionary action by the March 1 deadline given the dire budget outline for the 2011-2012 school year in which we are projecting a near $40 million deficit for the district,” Brady wrote. “Since the full extent of the potential cuts to the school budget have yet to be determined, issuing a dismissal letter to all teachers was necessary to give the mayor, the School Board and the district maximum flexibility to consider every cost savings option, including reductions in staff.” </p>

Cincinnati Public Schools is trying to figure out how it will balance its budget in the face of an expected loss in revenue next year of nearly $80 million, or 17 percent. The district, like schools across the state, is bracing for deep cuts to education funding when Gov. John Kasich releases his biennium budget today. It&#8217;s also facing losses in federal funding and rising expenses. The district made no decisions Monday night. The forum was intended to get the public&#8217;s opinion on what they think the core mission of the district should be and what programs are important to the community. </p>

Rick Snyder&#8217;s proposed cuts of $470 per pupil. These are the districts that have so little set aside in rainy day funds that Snyder&#8217;s cuts &#8212; coupled with a huge increase in retirement costs this summer &#8212; could put them in a deficit, joining the 43 districts and charters already there. It&#8217;s a situation that has mobilized school leaders &#8212; testifying in Lansing, writing lawmakers and sending letters to parents. They say that after years of closing schools, laying off staff and slashing programs, there&#8217;s little left to cut. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.centralvalleybusinesstimes.com/stories/001/?ID=17953">Massive enrollment cuts at CSU expected </a>= The nation’s largest university – California State University – is shrinking as state funding is cut. CSU trustees on Tuesday heard a series of proposals to cope with a cut of $500 million in state support – or possibly as much as $1 billion if some taxes set to expire June 30 are not extended. The state budget proposed by Gov. Jerry Brown calls for the $500 million in cuts to CSU, but the university says it will actually need to address a $550 million total gap in funding once $50 million in mandatory costs, including increased energy and employee health premiums, have been factored in.  The $500 million cut reduces CSU&#8217;s state funding by 18 percent from last year and equates to funding for over 85,000 students across the state, it says. </p>

That includes about 600 fewer students at the Fresno campus. At the CSU Board of Trustees meeting in Long Beach, administrators outlined strategies for the 23-campus system to cope with the $500 million, or 18 percent, cut proposed in Gov. Jerry Brown&#8217;s state budget plan. The system received about $2.8 billion in state funding for the current fiscal year. In addition to the enrollment cuts, the 23 campuses are being asked to reduce their budgets by a total of $281 million, officials said. Those cuts could lead to fewer course sections and fewer faculty and staff.The 600-student decrease would be in addition to cuts that have already been made. </p>

But they would be catastrophic for impoverished rural districts that have been starved of state aid for decades and are still reeling from cuts levied last year when David Paterson was governor. Already struggling to furnish even basic course offerings, the poorest districts would need to cannibalize themselves to keep the doors open and the lights on. </p>

The bill, LD 1346, establishes a &#8216;training wage&#8217; for employees under 20 years of age at $5.25 per hour for their first 180 days of employment and increases the amount of hours minors can legally work. The proposed &#8216;training wage&#8217; is over two dollars less than the state&#8217;s current minimum wage. The bill also would eliminate the maximum hours a minor over 16 can work during school days and allow minors to work over 50 hours a week when school is not in session. Another bill, LD 516, is headed to the Senate floor for a vote after being passed along party lines by a Senate committee, with Democrats voting against the measure.

                                <p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ASbgnL7Zl2Y/TahSA-pF1bI/AAAAAAAABmQ/B0KDk_PFguk/s1600/Clipboard01%2BNSA%2BCPI%2B4.bmp"><br /></a>In March the CPI increased 0.5% bringing the year over year change to 2.7%.</p>
<p>I will leave the analysis of the CPI to other and just discuss some of the implications.</p>
<p>First, this caused my Fed policy index to turn positive for the first time since 2008.  This index is a form of a Taylor Rule but it gives inflation and the unemployment rate an equal weight as compared to most versions of the Taylor Rule that give inflation roughly double the weight of unemployment or growth.  But this implies hat the Fed should allow QE 2 to expire this spring.  Moreover, it raises a real possibility that the Fed may raise feds funds in the second half of the year.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nk0WIi0ZhRI/TahSIfmPCmI/AAAAAAAABmY/XV5kqMmfGKU/s1600/Clipboard01%2BVOLKER.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nk0WIi0ZhRI/TahSIfmPCmI/AAAAAAAABmY/XV5kqMmfGKU/s320/Clipboard01%2BVOLKER.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Second, I will look at the not seasonally adjusted (NSA) core CPI.  In a low inflation environment firms tend to raise prices once a year, typically at the start of the year. As a consequence in the NSA core CPI over half the annual increase occurs in the first quarter of the year.<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dyHIJmSYBrE/TahRu02CFUI/AAAAAAAABmA/bBasgZz6nQs/s1600/Clipboard01%2BCORE%2BCPI%2B1.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dyHIJmSYBrE/TahRu02CFUI/AAAAAAAABmA/bBasgZz6nQs/s320/Clipboard01%2BCORE%2BCPI%2B1.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>The third quarter pop stems largely from tuition, home owners equivalent rent and new car prices.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2011 the NSA core CPI rose 0.852% as compared to 0.469% in 2010.<br />This is the first time since 2004 that the NSA core CPI was higher than in the prior year.<br />If the average that some 55% of the annual increase occurs in the first quarter holds this year it implies that in 2011 the December to December increase in the core CPI will be about 1.55% or about doulbe the 2010 gain.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xIoJawrtsyI/TahR2KwIDXI/AAAAAAAABmI/4vZEr1Fmhc0/s1600/Clipboard01%2BNSA%2BCPI%2B2.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xIoJawrtsyI/TahR2KwIDXI/AAAAAAAABmI/4vZEr1Fmhc0/s320/Clipboard01%2BNSA%2BCPI%2B2.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />A 1.5% annual increase in the core CPI would be well within the Fed&#8217;s implied target of 2%<br />core inflation.  To but this in perspective, from 1965 to 2008 the core CPI never fell below<br />2%.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ASbgnL7Zl2Y/TahSA-pF1bI/AAAAAAAABmQ/B0KDk_PFguk/s1600/Clipboard01%2BNSA%2BCPI%2B4.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ASbgnL7Zl2Y/TahSA-pF1bI/AAAAAAAABmQ/B0KDk_PFguk/s320/Clipboard01%2BNSA%2BCPI%2B4.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />In the short run, however rising inflation is creating problems for the consumer. In March the year over year change in real average hourly earnings fell to -1.0% and real weekly wage growth turned negative.  This weakness in real wages is showing up in the economic data.<br />For example, in March nominal retail sales rose 0.4%.  But most of this was gasoline and excluding service station sales, nominal retail sales only rose 0.1%.  This CPI report strongly implies that real retail sales actually fell in March.  This means that in the first quarter real consumer spending is ending on a very weak note &#8212; one reason forecasters were optimistic about first quarter growth three months age was that the fourth quarter ended on a strong note.  Moreover, the second quarter will be when the biggest impact of the disruptions to the supply chain from the Japanese disaster will occur. So the standard thinking that growth will rebound in the second quarter is questionable.</p>

<p>Why I will not be Voting for Obama in 2012</p>
<p>Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=417">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>The presidential elections are a year and a half away, but I am pretty certain of one thing:  I will not be voting to re-elect Barack Obama.  That does not mean that I will be voting for the Republican nominee, or for any of the third party candidates, but rather that I do not see any likely circumstances under which Barack Obama will do anything I think is necessary to earn my vote.  That may seem unusual because I voted for Obama, and my economic views are probably best described as slightly left center.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m nobody special, and my endorsement or lack of it isn&#8217;t going to make a whit of difference, but I suspect there are other people who are also somewhere close to slightly left of center (i.e., who are either what Obama considers to be his &#8220;natural constituency&#8221; or close enough that they can be convinced to vote for him rather than his likely eventual opponent) who are starting to think the same thing I am.  So perhaps its worth trying to explain why I feel the way I do.  I think its easiest to do that by discussing the issues I think I important and what Obama has done (or not) about them.</p>
<p>1.  Economic growth/unemployment/taxes.  These three topics, as Senator Ryan and all economists know, are closely inter-related.  Sadly, the relationship between these three topics is very, very different than Senator Ryan and most economists believe.  Getting the economy moving is vital after <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/06/economic-growth-rates-presidents-party.html">eight years of mediocre growth</a> under GW Bush, culminating in the Great Recession.  But when you go back as far as the data allows, you find <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=278">a quadratic relationship between the top marginal tax rate in one year and growth in the subsequent year </a>, and that we are at a point on the curve where it is an increase, not a decrease in tax rates, that is likely to lead to faster economic growth.  Even sticking to the period of relatively low taxes we’ve been in since Reagan started his tax cuts, <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=253">growth rates should go up and unemployment rates should go down </a> if tax rates go up.</p>
<p>There are two reasons this is true.  One is that taxes pay for the existence of the government.  The government provides services the government provides that are conducive to growth and which the private sector simply has not historically provided at non-negligible levels.  These services include national defense, monitoring and controlling epidemics, and building infrastructure.  </p>
<p>The government also provides some leadership that can make it possible for the private sector to adopt new technologies.  As an example – in this day and age, having a vehicle that could run on any mix of gasoline, ethanol or natural gas (depending on which is cheapest per mile) would be a nice thing to have.  You can buy one of those vehicles today… in Brazil.  Never heard of such a thing?  Well, there are millions of bi-flex and tri-flex vehicles on the road in Brazil today, made by such exotic companies as GM, Ford, Volkswagen, and Mercedes.  Why are there so many flex-fuel cars and motorcycles on the road in Brazil?  Because the Brazilian government realized you can’t get from 1970s fuel shortages to where they are now without someone forcing both auto makers and fuel stations to make changes simultaneously.  Without government action, auto makers wouldn’t have been willing to mass produce flex-fuel vehicles out of fear there would be no filling stations for those vehicles, and fueling stations would have been reluctant to make investments out of fear that there would be no vehicles to take advantage of them.  In other words, the situation we see in the U.S.</p>
<p>But there is another, perhaps more important reason, why higher tax rates often lead to faster economic growth and lower unemployment.  As I keep pointing out, any good business owner (and any lousy one, for that matter) will tell you, if you tax something more, you get less of it.  And income taxes can be seen as penalties on withdrawing money from one’s business for the purpose of consumption, which means they discourage business owners from taking profits out of their business.  The alternative to taking profits and consuming is re-investing in the business.  Thus, higher tax rates on income lead to more investment on business.  And this result is borne out empirically; when the top marginal rate is below 50%, a tax increase is correlated with more private investment and less private consumption. </p>
<p>2.  Deficits and the national debt.  This is another tax related issue.  Historically, during and following tax hikes <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=241">tax  collections /GDP rise</a>.  During and following tax cuts, tax collections fall.   (How a fact so basic that even a child could observe it in the data became a surprise to many people is a testament to, ahem, economists like Art Laffer and Thomas Sowell.  <br />But there are many ways to cut taxes people pay, and changing the marginal rate is only one such way.  Enforcement of tax law is another.  Since 1929 (that’s as far back as data is available) – every single Republican President decreased the tax burden, the percentage of people’s income paid in taxes, and thus far, <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=92">all Democrats but Truman and Obama have increased that percentage.</a>  Click on the link and you’ll also see that growth rates were much faster for Presidents who increased the tax burden than for Presidents who decreased it.  Though there are many ways of being fiscally responsible or irresponsible, it is, of course, easier to balance the budget if tax revenues are higher.  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/republican-party-and-national-debt.html">The last four Republican Presidents – Ford, Reagan, and the two Bushes all increased the national debt.</a>  Conversely, before Obama you had to go back to 1944, when the nation was fighting World War 2, to find a Democrat in the Oval Office who increased the national debt.  </p>
<p>And yes, I know, there was a bad recession going on when Obama took office, and the economy still sucks.  And yes, I agree with Keynes  &#8211; the data shows that expansions following recessions during which the government increased its spending <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=15">are longer and stronger than</a> when expansions following recessions during which the government cut spending.  But that spending should have been paid for  with tax hikes.  Historically, when the government raises taxes during or shortly after a recession, the resulting expansion is longer and stronger than when the government cuts taxes.  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=3">That’s what the data shows</a>.  The reasons are the same as given above in the discussion about economic growth, plus one:  during periods of economic weakness those in the private sector tend to sit on money.  </p>
<p>As an aside – it is worth noting that both this Great Recession and the Great Depression came <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=192">about half a decade after big reductions in both marginal tax rates and regulation.</a>  Coincidence?</p>
<p>3.  Obama’s performance might resemble that of other Democratic administrations more closely had he chosen economic advisors who paid more attention to data and were less enamored of the policies GW Bush was employing.  When you pick an advisor who <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/01/further-critique-of-romer-and-romer.html">jumps through hoops to be like one of GW’s economic advisors</a>, you will get GW’s outcomes.  Its even worse <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/11/christy-romer-to-cea.html">when you’ve been warned</a> and you do it anyway.   Frankly, if I say so myself, it isn’t that difficult to find <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=174">people who actually can spot business cycles at both ends</a>.</p>
<p>4.  The bail-outs.  Of course, one of the big contributors to the Obama deficits are how Obama reacted to the poor state of the economy.  (In fairness, some of the bail-out spending was pre-committed by the previous administration, but then Obama voted in favor of that spending as a Senator and didn’t try to walk it back once he became President.)  But where are the prosecutions?  Was there not wrongdoing?  And then you have stories <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-real-housewives-of-wall-street-look-whos-cashing-in-on-the-bailout-20110411?print=true">like Matt Taibbi’s latest</a>.  Like GW’s policies before him, Obama’s approach seems almost designed create another mess.  </p>
<p>5.  Health care.  Obama care = Romney care.  This is a policy that Republicans were pushing a decade ago, and would still be pushing if a Democrat hadn’t proposed it.  Where is the public option?</p>
<p>6.  The wars.  I don’t have a solution, but then I didn’t spend a few hundred million bucks running for President, nor am I about to spend a billion dollars running for re-election.  It is the height of immorality to seek out the presidency or re-election in a time of war and yet have no clue how to bring the war to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p>I always thought it was the height of insanity for anyone to vote to re-elect GW in 2004, after screwing up the economy and two wars.  Yes, I know some <a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/7505">worthies were still talking “Mount Rushmore” a year or two later</a>, but one should be better than that.  And yes, there are a handful of things Obama did that GW might not do, but let’s be realistic – this has looked from the very beginning like GW’s third term.</p>
<p>Which leaves just one question – if the policies of the Republicans are even worse than Obama&#8217;s – and they tend to support anti-growth tax policies (calling them pro-growth doesn’t change the data), what should a rational person do?  I don’t know.  But I think if I’m going to see Republican policies enacted, I’d prefer to see them run under a Republican label.  See, Democratic policies may not be very good, but historically they have tended to produce  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=92">better results</a> than Republican policies.  (BTW &#8211; Michael Kanell and I have an entire book called Presimetrics looking at how Presidents performed on a wide range of topics.)  Another four years spent bringing the feeble Democratic brand down to the levels of the even more feeble Republican brand will cause lasting damage.</p>

                                <p>Guest Post From Robert Bowman, M.D. </p>
<p><strong>No Assumptions for a Change</strong></p>
<p>Assumptions are often incorrect and the assumptions are incredibly inaccurate in primary care and in basic health access. When one starts with the assumption of more pay, then it is easy to rationalize more training or more complexity of care &#8211; even when there is little evidence other than assumption.</p>
<p>Primary care is often more difficult than specialty care. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>A major reason is that the design of health care in the United States destroys primary care delivery. Reasons for primary care to be challenging are the complexity of the patients, the lack of support staff, the lack of primary care trained support staff, the lack of experienced support staff, the broad scope of primary care, the lack of respect for primary care by those who clearly have little clue regarding primary care delivery, and participating in smaller operations that are neglected by the health care design. </p>
<p>The fragmentation of care with even more fragmentation on the way is a problem. The required context of care includes major care provided by Americans most left out of the designs for health and education – who often cannot access care other than the basics. </p>
<p>The reimbursement for primary care that is less than the rapidly increasing cost of delivering primary care forces primary care practitioners to do additional efforts outside of primary care to support their primary care practices.</p>
<p>The decision to pay more for care other than primary care is arbitrary. This design was set up beginning 100 years ago by those who envisioned domination of all of health care and who assumed their superiority. Even in the 1940s medical leaders still understood the challenges facing generalists – because some generalists still were in leadership positions and other leaders had been generalists prior to their specialization. Once the entire context of selection, training, and practice support was designed subspecialist, this understanding was lost and the current assumptions reigned unchallenged. </p>
<p>The subspecialty and academic forces reached their domination in the last decades, rebounded from the managed care reforms with even greater domination – and the United States has all of the cost, quality, and access consequences now that cripple our nation and its people.</p>
<p>There is supporting evidence for primary care complexity as greater at the current time. This includes the fact that two-thirds of primary care graduates (28,000 from six sources) depart primary care. All types are departing primary care with 55 – 85% of graduates after graduation other than family medicine graduates (who have fewest other options).  There is lower national health spending on primary care (5% is all there is) and the locations where primary care workforce is highest percentage also receives lowest health care spending at 5% for rural locations and 5% for underserved locations. Established<br />primary care practitioners have continued to depart primary care even during the 1990s periods of increasing policy support (PA, IM), </p>
<p>Few that are found in direct patient care primary care delivery from nurse, advanced nursing, nurse practitioner, PA, and IM training. Pediatric and medicine pediatric training both now yield less than a majority for primary care as well. In all of these types as well as in family medicine, a minority fraction of the training is spent on primary care. Primary care basics are taught, but it takes a lifetime of dedication to patients and to primary care delivery to even begin to comprehend primary care. Compare primary care and specialty care after a decade of care delivery. Who is worth more &#8211; my vote is for a dedicated primary care practitioner in a continuity location with a continuity team? Perhaps many if not most would contest this, but most comparisons are apples and oranges as primary care is so poorly understood.Training that yields primary care as a side effect of specialty care is also apples and oranges as the RN, NP, PA, MD, and DO primary care should be primary care in selection, in training, and in a lifetime of care delivered. </p>
<p>The US needs a foundation of primary care – a balance between primary care and other care. The designs must support this. Even 80% of physicians support more funding for primary care delivery (Leigh) but when asked to give up a few percentage points of reimbursement (that might not even impair pay), physician support melted away.  </p>
<p>Once again I would note that nations need designs for care that serve nearly all in a nation nearly all of the years of their life in nearly all locations not a design that serves few for a few years in a few locations. </p>
<p>And there is always a nice video to review such as We&#8217;re Number 37 in health outcomes (www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVgOl3cETb4), not to mention a health care design that cripples our economy, all levels of government from schools to federal, our children, and our children&#8217;s children. </p>
<p>The current design ensures more graduates from NP, PA, DO, and MD with each passing year as well as higher percentages entering non-primary care as well as higher percentages of primary care graduates entering non-primary care. What we have is more like fantasy as compared to assumption.</p>

<p>Of course, several members of the media have the details already.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/markknoller">CBS&#8217;s Mark Knoller has been tweeting details</a>, including:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The budget will claim $1 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years. </li>
<li>During that time, however, total deficits will hit $7 trillion. </li>
<li>Over 5 years, there will be $78 billion in defense spending cuts. </li>
<li>There will be a 5-year freeze in discretionary non-defense spending. </li>
<li>3 year AMT patch will be proposed.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s not in the budget? Anything relating to Social Security and other entitlements.</p>
<p>
<p>Meanwhile,<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/49452.html"> POLITICO</a> has more details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Education spending will increase 11% next year. </li>

<blockquote><p>To be fair, applying maximizing thinking has achieved some major successes even in macroeconomics. The permanent income/life cycle style of consumption theory does a much better job of accounting for the stylized facts about spending than the old, mechanical consumption function. The natural rate hypothesis, with its crucial implication that high inflation would get built into expectations and not reduce unemployment, was the result of (loose) maximizing reasoning.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have two discouraging thoughts.  First both of the examples of a useful application of the assumption of maximizing behavior are due to Milton Friedman (and others).  This shows that Milton Friedman can say useful things while appealing to maximization.  I think we can conclude that either the concept of maximization is useful or Milton Friedman was so smart that he could say smart things when standing one foot, rubbing his belly, patting his head, and talking about maximizing agents.  I&#8217;m afraid the question of which conclusion is more plausible answers itself. Outside of macro we have Arrow and Samuelson and well a bunch of smart people who can say smart things and solve equations at the same time.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Second I now wonder if the PIH glass is half full.  Consider a model of totally myopic backward looking agents with habit formation, so consumption moves sluggishly towards current income.  This can give consumption depending on lagged income &#8212; say a geometric lag.  Which of the stylized facts expalained by the PIH are also explained by this not at all optimizing model ?  I think basically all of them.  The model is due to Stever Marglin who was a bit too heterodox to get attention.  But I think it works as well as the PIH.  </p>
<p>Taking an equation for x and re-interpreting it as giving x* and making an error correction model of (x-x*) is exactly what macroeconomists used to do before the Rational expectations revolution. It is exactly what Sargent denounces as not taking a model seriously.  And, I think, it fits consumption just as well as the PIH.</p>
<p>Oh and as for the shifting Phillips curve, one can go back to a golden oldy &#8220;The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money&#8221; to find a very clear warning that one better not treat a Phillips curve as a structural equation (only slighly hampered by the lack of the terms &#8220;Phillips&#8221; and &#8220;structural&#8221;).</p>
