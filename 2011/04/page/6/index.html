                                <p>Wisconsin Supreme Court election update</p>
<p>They seem to have gone to sleep over in Wisconsin.  I did too but now I&#8217;m awake.<br />The current state of the supreme court election is that 3,596 of 3,630 precincts have reported and the incumbent conservative Walker ally is Prosser is ahead of the challenger Kloppenberg by 733,074 to 732489, that is by 585 votes.  The precincts which haven&#8217;t reported are almost all in counties which went heavily for Kloppenberg.</p>
<p>I calculated a crude predictin by extrapolation assuming that votes in precincts which haven&#8217;t reported will be equal to the county average over precincts which have reported.  This requires two approximations, first that the fraction won by Prosser is about the same and second that there are about the same number of votes in each precinct withing a county.  Importantly, it is reported that some precincts which have &#8220;reported&#8221; haven&#8217;t reported absentee ballots.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I extrapolate that Kloppenberg will gain 1857.13 votes on Prosser and so win by 1,272 votes which is about 0.09% of the extrapolated total.</p>
<p>I confidently predict a recount.  </p>

                                <p><strong>Health Care Thoughts: ACO Draft Regulations</strong> On March 31st the Obama administration issued the draft regulations for Medicare Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). ACOs are to eventually be the centerpiece of cost savings for the entire US health care system. This is the first peak at how the ACOs might be defined. In the &#8220;they never learn&#8221; category, the draft regulations are 429 pages long. http://www.ofr.gov/OFRUpload/OFRData/2011-07880_PI.pdf Okay, I read the beast, and have a couple of findings among the many dozens of pages of bureaucratic gibberish. 1. The sections delineating what an ACO should accomplish and how to do it are well formed and should be adoptable without much change. Whether these ambitious goals are attainable is a major question and concern. 2. The feds are not certain who should participate in the first round of Medicare ACOs and have laid out many options that will require a great deal of comment and time to sort out. I suspect the more limited options (physician and physician-extender providers and hospitals) will be used for the first round. It is likely the final regs will not be published until fall, and these ACOs are supposed to be operating January 1, 2012. This is a tight timeline. Tom aka Rusty Rustbelt</p>

                                <p>The point of this article is to demonstrate that Germany has enjoyed increased &#8216;competitiveness&#8217; as measured by productivity levels and relative prices. But the clarity of Germany&#8217;s &#8216;competitiveness&#8217; cannot be established by using German data in the form of a black box &#8211; a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the region is the only way to see this.</p>
<p>In a very well written piece, <a href="http://kantooseconomics.com/2011/04/03/is-germany-competitive-is-norway/">Kantoos highlights</a> that the German current account surplus is more a function of reduced investment and productivity passing through to low market-clearing wages than it is &#8216;competitiveness&#8217;, per se. While I agree with his economic analysis, I disagree that Germany is not competitive &#8211; Italy, yes; Germany, no.<br />(read much more after the jump!)<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The term &#8216;competitiveness&#8217; is rather non-discriminatory. It can refer to a lot of things. Below, I discuss national competitiveness, i.e., measuring a country&#8217;s relative position in the global market place. In contrast, micro-level competition &#8211; firms compete in various industries for market share and profits &#8211; is not really relevant here. The fact that we&#8217;re talking about a nation&#8217;s competitiveness means that it&#8217;s not clear how to measure competitiveness. Let&#8217;s explore.</p>
<p>In order for Germany to be deemed sufficiently &#8216;uncompetitive&#8217; globally, <strong>relatively</strong> weak productivity gains would have left German wages <strong>relatively</strong> low compared to major trading partners. And by extension, Germany&#8217;s standard of living must also have suffer compared to its trading partners. From what I can see, only relative wages have been surpressed. Therefore, I conclude that Germany is competitive.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 1</strong>: German productivity gains over the last decade &#8211; I use the period 2000-2008, so as to not bias the results downward from the global recession &#8211; have not been striking, but positive nevertheless.</p>

Notably, the Euro area average is down, which is probably biased by Italy&#8217;s 8.7% cumulative drop in productivity. So on a relative basis, Germany&#8217;s productive and second only to Spain in this sample (notably Spain gained a whopping 4.1%!). (Also, please see <a href="http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp119.pdf">Chart 18 of this ECB research </a>paper for a broader comparison &#8211; it&#8217;s a .pdf file).</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 2</strong>: Despite the relatively weak productivity gains, albeit positive I remind you, the standard of living has increased in line with other Eurozone economies, like France, and surpassed others, like Italy.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gKxbpa4V2vw/TZtFkrGrHbI/AAAAAAAADks/k3ET8LH0MrI/s1600/per-capita_RGDP.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gKxbpa4V2vw/TZtFkrGrHbI/AAAAAAAADks/k3ET8LH0MrI/s400/per-capita_RGDP.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This chart, to me, illustrates that productivity gains have been &#8216;competitive&#8217; enough to support decent growth in the average standard of living (as measured by real per-capita GDP <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2010/02/weodata/index.aspx">from the IMF</a>).</p>
<p>And to really hammer down the point, please see <a href="http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp119.pdf">page 24 in a recent ECB research report, Chart 18 referenced above, </a>on the impact of the global recession on Euro area competitiveness. Germany&#8217;s 2000-2008 annual average productivity gains are in line with many other European economy, but wage compensation is relatively muted. In fact, German average annual compensation per employee is the lowest of the cross-section (according to Chart 18). My point is, that productivity gains were not fully passed on to workers via nominal compensation gains (probably a better comparison would be real compensation per employee).</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 3</strong>: It&#8217;s all about levels; and Germany&#8217;s 2010 average income is relatively high (measured in GDP per-capita PPP dollars for comparability across exchange rate regimes).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ap-NVqsJr4s/TZtFkaNn_zI/AAAAAAAADkk/07H5kIZLLwg/s1600/per-capita_GDP_2010.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ap-NVqsJr4s/TZtFkaNn_zI/AAAAAAAADkk/07H5kIZLLwg/s400/per-capita_GDP_2010.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The German standard of living (i.e., relative per-capita GDP) fairs well against a cross-section of developed economies in Europe and abroad. Average income (standard of living) is the fourth highest behind Norway (for comparison to Kantoos&#8217; article), the US, and Canada. Italy runs low current account deficits (trade is pretty well balanced), and average income falls at the bottom of this sample. That&#8217;s very uncompetitive in the relative sense.</p>
<p>The second issue that I mentioned is measurement &#8211; i.e., there&#8217;s a problem with using just unit labor costs to measure &#8216;competitiveness&#8217; (<a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/04/debunking-the-idea-that-labor-productivity-is-the-cause-of-euro-periphery-woes.html">see a recent Naked Capitalism article to the point</a>).</p>
<p>However, no matter how you look at relative prices &#8211; the real exchange rate, relative export prices, relative unit labor costs, relative GDP deflators, etc. &#8211; Germany stands out as very &#8216;competitive&#8217;, or at least &#8216;exportable&#8217;. I have no direct chart to support my previous statement; but the European Commission does. The EC publishes a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/pcqr/index_en.htm">quarterly report on price and cost competitiveness</a>; and according to the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/pcqr/2010/pdf/pccr210_en.pdf">most recent report, 2Q 2010 (.pdf),</a> Germany is very competitive by any measure of relative prices(see pages 15-16 of the .pdf).</p>
<p>In conclusion, it&#8217;s difficult for me to see how Germany is not &#8216;competitive&#8217; on a relative basis, if &#8216;competitive&#8217; is either (1) standard of living and relative productivity gains, or (2) in a relative prices sense.</p>
<p>I would state here that within the Eurozone, a healthy rebalancing of current accounts is underway (i.e., typical creditors dissaving and typical debtors saving). This would be made much easier if the ECB would run looser policy and allow German inflation to overshoot, effectively facilitating the relative price adjustements.

<p>Well, it seems as if Congressional Republicans are going to propose a complete refashioning of the Medicare program. Specifically, they are going to recommend scrapping Medicare as a provider of health insurance to seniors, and instead replace it with a system that will provide subsidies to individuals who will then buy health insurance from private insurance companies. In other words, they want to get the federal government completely out of the health insurance business for senior citizens. </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-2012-overhauls-on-entitlements-and-taxes-4t-in-cuts-over-decade/2011/04/04/AFXRhsdC_story.html?hpid=z1">GOP 2012: overhauls on entitlements and taxes, $6.2 trillion in cuts over decade</a> </p>
<p>House Republicans plan to propose Tuesday historic changes to Medicare, Medicaid and other popular programs that pour federal money into Americans’ lives, arguing that a sacrifice now will keep those programs solvent for the future. </p>
<p>&#8230;On Medicare, Ryan will propose altering the plan so that the federal government no longer acts as a health insurer for seniors. Instead, he would create what’s called a “premium support plan.” Seniors would pick from a list of private insurance plans, and Medicare would subsidize their coverage. </p>
<p>The idea, again, is to use market competition to create a system with lower costs. Ryan’s plan would not apply to Americans age 55 and older, for whom Medicare would remain under the current system.</p></blockquote>
<p>The notion that Medicare costs have been rising because it is a government-run health insurance program, or because it is not a &#8220;competitive&#8221; health insurance program, is odd, to say the least&#8230; </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Theoretically, economists can list a number of very specific ways in which the markets for health care and health insurance are characterized by <a href="http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/health-insurance-market-failures-and-what-can-be-done-about-them/">market failures</a>. And for those of you who have forgotten your Econ 101 lessons, please recall that economic theory clearly predicts that when there are market failures there is no reason to necessarily expect that competition (i.e. the free market solution) will provide a good outcome. </p>
<p>Providing yet another example when <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/effectiveness-of-austerity-in-uk.html">economic theory actually matches what we see in the real world</a> quite well, we find that there is absolutely no evidence that competition among private health insurance companies leads to lower costs. The Kaiser Family Foundation conducts a <a href="http://ehbs.kff.org/?page=abstract&#038;id=1">survey of employer-sponsored health insurance programs</a> every year to estimate private health insurance premiums. Health insurance premiums for workers in large companies &#8212; those employing 200 people or more, which encompasses about 65% of all workers covered by private, <strong><em>competitive</em></strong>, employer-sponsored health insurance plans &#8212; rose by 135% over the ten year period 1999 to 2009. </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1cp6-OC3QKw/TZsivjXBZHI/AAAAAAAAAeU/FSMU7x96om8/s1600/HI%2Bvs%2BMedicare%2Bcosts2.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1cp6-OC3QKw/TZsivjXBZHI/AAAAAAAAAeU/FSMU7x96om8/s400/HI%2Bvs%2BMedicare%2Bcosts2.PNG"></a>Meanwhile, Medicare spending per person rose by about 103% over the same period. (Note that to get this figure I simply divided total Medicare costs from the CBO (<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/budget/data/historical.pdf">pdf</a>) by the number of Medicare enrollees as provided by Census (<a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf">pdf</a>).) </p>
<p>Given this, I&#8217;m really baffled by this repetition of the assertion that more competition in the market for health insurance is the answer. There&#8217;s no theoretical justification for it, and no empirical evidence for it. The fact is that people in the US consume more health care services every year. So every year we pay more.</p>

<p>OMB Watch recommends six changes Congress and the Obama administration should make to <a href="http://www.usaspending.gov/">USAspending.gov</a>, the government&#8217;s spending website which is based off of one of their websites, <a href="http://www.fedspending.org/">FedSpending.org</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Making USAspending.gov better isn’t just about improving the quality of the current data, which Friday&#8217;s hearing focused on a great deal, it’s also about broadening the site’s scope. We need to bring in other data sources to improve, and help give context to, the spending data already on USAspending.gov. To that end, the testimony outlines a six-point plan for advancing federal spending transparency: 
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Treasury data: Use spending information directly from the nation’s checkbook, which would improve data quality </li>
<p>
<li>Tax expenditure data: Shed light on the more than $1 trillion in tax expenditures </li>
<p>
<li>Multi-tier sub-recipient reporting: Everyone who gets federal funds must report in, as opposed to the current two-tier system </li>
<p>
<li>Unique entity identification: Create a new system to link recipients to lobbying data, contractor performance information, etc. </li>
<p>
<li>Full text of contracts: Show detailed information on government projects, not just short summaries </li>
<p>
<li>Performance information: Provide meaningful data on which programs are effective</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>OMB notes that in the House, <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/node/11576">funds for such initiatives were slashed</a>: </p>
<p>
<p>In the midst of a fight about the budget deficit, Congress is poised to shut down federal websites that tell the public how the government spends our money. It&#8217;s ironic and disappointing. Websites like USAspending.gov and Data.gov have started to make government more transparent. But just when things are starting to get better, Congress wants to take us backward. Members of Congress love to talk about transparency, but the spending bill being negotiated right now would slash funding for vital transparency programs by 94 percent. Agencies are already making contingency plans to shut down the sites if their funding is cut so drastically. Congress is set to vote on the budget this week. Incredibly, Congress wants to cut the Electronic Government Fund even though it represents only 0.002 percent of the deficit. But this tiny slice of the budget pays big dividends: sites like USAspending.gov help citizens and government watchdogs spot wasteful spending and other abuses – and deter them from happening in the first place. We can&#8217;t afford to not know how our money is being spent. Meanwhile, Congress hasn&#8217;t held a single hearing to debate the destructive impact these cuts would have on government openness.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no secret I&#8217;m not a fan of the birth-death adjustment to the employment serieses: not from a necessary belief that they&#8217;re biased, but rather because they give the lie to the illusion of accurate monthly data.</p>
<p>But imagine for the moment that there had been no adjustment before the January data release.  The headline number for January might well have been north of 400,000, making the past three months even more impressive (from a headline perspective only, but still…) in terms of job creation.</p>
<p>Would that change anyone&#8217;s opinion of the timing and/or need for tightening?  (See also my post earlier today with the graphic borrowed from The Big Picture marking a growth comparison with 2003-2004.)</p>

                                <p>I don&#8217;t remember seeing any of this type of story last year. But this year, Socialism stories abound from the Midwest.</p>
<p>My ex-roommate* sends this link to <a href="http://www.nbc.com/news-sports/msnbc-video/town-rallies-to-send-players-family-to-final-four/">a story about Butler Bulldogs&#8217;s Senior Matt Howard&#8217;s family being able to attend the NCAA Finals tonight in Houston</a> (video link <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/42390985#42390985">here</a>).<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Luke Winn of Sports Illustrated <a href="http://tourney.si.com/2011/04/01/conversations-with-connersville-ind/">covered the macro territory</a>. The 12.7% unemployment rate, up from a few years ago and still 2nd-highest in the state of the 92 counties. The population of &#8220;about 13,000,&#8221; which puts the decline since I graduated high school at worse-than-Detroit levels—but that makes sense since most of the factory work over the previous forty years was Ford-related as the town once referred to as &#8220;Little Detroit&#8221; lost competitors to larger areas and consolidation.</p>
<p>Winn&#8217;s article, not to mention <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dc-sports-bog/post/butlers-matt-howard-is-a-bike-riding-minimalist/2011/03/17/ABbTlGm_blog.html">several</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/sports/ncaabasketball/26howard.html">other</a> recent pieces about Howard&#8217;s childhood make it clear that it really does take a village. From the NYT piece:<br />
<blockquote>His mother, Linda, who credited her faith for helping her raise 10 children, said strangers would stop and ask, &#8220;Are you the lady with all the kids?&#8221; before dropping off bags of clothes. &#8220;Maybe everything didn&#8217;t fit,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But we didn&#8217;t complain.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Bryan Caplan&#8217;s noted in <a href="http://www/kauffman.org/KauffmanMultimedia.aspx?VideoId=876788042001&#038;type=R">his presentation at Kauffman</a> that he knows no one who is liquidity-constrained in their ability to raise children; rather, it&#8217;s time allocation that stops them. I suspect he needs to get out more.</p>
<p>And now the city with 12.7% unemployment and a dim future has once again reached into its collective pockets to make certain that Matt Howard&#8217;s family gets to see their son&#8217;s/brother&#8217;s final college game, which also happens to be for the NCAA Championship.</p>
<p>From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.</p>
<p>As I said, I didn&#8217;t see stories like this last year. Last year, there was still another year for Howard and the Bulldogs. Now, there is no possible future NCAA Championship; this is the last time this can ever happen. An economist would tell you that people recognized the Scarcity Value and dug into their pockets accordingly.</p>
<p>So not only did it take a Village to help as best they could to raise the ten Howard children, it took a Village to enable the family to go to Houston to see now-senior Matt Howard and the rest of the Butler Bulldogs play—win or lose; I hope win—for the NCAA Championship.</p>
<p><em>Ex ante</em>, it&#8217;s a great decision. <em>Ex post</em>, it will still have been one.</p>

<p>*For whom <a href="http://innovationandgrowth.wordpress.com/">Mike Mandel</a> took a picture of Tyler and Natasha Cowen at last week&#8217;s Kauffman Economic Bloggers Forum, since he and Tyler were once ranked (by Tyler) as the #1 and #2 chess players in the area. Sadly, neither went into the sport as a full-time professional.</p>

<p>Deficit numbers for CEA chair signatories on the deficit letter</strong> Cross-posted at <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=404" target="_blank">Presimetrics</a>   Title updated</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kind of late to this, but apparently ten ex-chairs of the President&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisors decided to <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/51864.html">share their opinion about the national debt with the rest of us.</a> There&#8217;s been commentary here and there about how hypocritical some of the names on the list are &#8211; the CEA chair is the President&#8217;s chief economic advisor, and many of these people served under Presidents (and provided economic advice) that drove up the debt. I thought it would be an interesting exercise to put some numbers on the hypocrisy. <br /><a name="more"></a> <br />To do that, I pulled <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea/about/Former-Members">the dates for which each CEA chair served</a> and <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/GFDEBTN">quarterly figures for the total public debt</a>. The debt series I obtained (from the Federal Reserve Economic database) goes back to 1966. The terms of each CEA chair served did not completely coincide with a yearly quarter, but I split them up as best I could. (Note &#8211; because sometimes it took a while for a CEA chair to be confirmed, but that person could well be offering the President advice before confirmation, I assumed that each CEA chair &#8220;took office&#8221; immediately after his/her predecessor left.) </p>
<p>The debt was adjusted by quarterly <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CPIAUCNS/downloaddata?cid=9">CPI</a>, and <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=1966&#038;LastYear=2010&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;Java">population</a>, resulting in the real national debt per capita. The following figure shows the change in the national debt per person on a quarterly basis, over the length of each CEA chair&#8217;s term. The gray bars represent those who signed the letter. </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lQztipEU8I8/TZnmpevmfrI/AAAAAAAAAkc/5wWald-X2vo/s1600/CEA_chairs1.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lQztipEU8I8/TZnmpevmfrI/AAAAAAAAAkc/5wWald-X2vo/s320/CEA_chairs1.bmp"></a>Figure 1. </p>
<p>A few comments. </p>
<p>1. Most of the signatories to the letter increased the national debt per person. </p>
<p>2. A number of the CEA chairs are or have been with the Fed &#8211; none of them (Greenspan, Yellen, Bernanke) have signed the letter. </p>
<p>3. Harvey Rosen may look responsible&#8230; but that&#8217;s a function of the timing of the brief term (about a quarter) he served, encompassing the period when individual tax returns were due. He served under GW Bush, after all, and nothing GW, and despite what many supposed conservatives were saying through 2004, at no point did GW ever do anything that resembled being fiscally responsible. </p>
<p>4. About the only signatories who on the face of it have a leg to stand on signing this letter are Schultze (Carter&#8217;s CEA) and Bailey (Clinton&#8217;s last CEA chair). </p>
<p>5. I think its fair to stretch the leg to stand on thing to include Laura Tyson, Clinton&#8217;s first CEA chair. Yes, the debt increased while she was in office, but at a rapidly decreasing rate, and her advice provided some of the ground for the surpluses that came at the end of the Clinton term. </p>
<p>6. I&#8217;m sympathetic to Keynes&#8217; view that a responsible government runs up the debt when times are bad, and pays off the debt at other times. By that standard, a lot of these signatories have no excuse whatsoever. I believe it speaks very poorly of economics as a profession that anyone takes Martin Feldstein, Glenn Hubbard, Greg Mankiw, or Edward Lazear seriously, and I believe it is a sign that they have no honor that they would have the temerity to put their names on a letter like this. These are not, after all, low level drones whose livelihood depends on not making waves, but rather financially secure architects of the policies that cratered this country&#8217;s finances. As I see it, they were in the position to do good, and instead they enabled bad. </p>
<p>7. That Obama inherited an economic mess does not excuse his economic policies, or those who provided him with advice (Romer &#038; Goolsbee). Nationalizing debt incurred by companies (and there is no other way to describe the process by which nonperforming financial assets were taken off the ledgers of many companies) without also nationalizing the assets of those companies is a surefire way to ensure something like the Great Recession will happen again. And even a mediocre economist should have had the skills to convince even the densest of White House residents what happens when you don&#8217;t even try to incarcerate any of the bad actors. </p>
<p>8. I hesitate to disagree with <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/03/greg-mankiw-budget-arsonist-screaming-for-a-firehose.html">Brad DeLong</a> who is usually right, but I think there is yet another reason to avoid excusing his colleague Christina Romer. When a person&#8217;s most famous paper reaches a conclusion that gives ammunition to those who are wrong about economic policy, and that paper is itself a <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/01/further-critique-of-romer-and-romer.html">textbook application</a> of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&#038;_udi=B6WY2-4NSX3Y5-5&#038;_user=10&#038;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F1960&#038;_rdoc=1&#038;_fmt=high&#038;_orig=gateway&#038;_origin=gateway&#038;_sort=d&#038;_docanchor=&#038;view=c&#038;_searchStrId=1703295207&#038;_rerunOrigin=google&#038;_acct=C000050221&#038;_version=1&#038;_urlVersion=0&#038;_userid=10&#038;md5=db031230a1348cde70370b7da4f5207c&#038;searchtype=a">Maier&#8217;s Law</a>, that person&#8217;s advice can only produce poor results. </p>
<p>9. If I had to award a &#8220;Supreme Chutzpah&#8221; award to any of the signers, I guess it would be Glenn Hubbard. Not only did he turn a surplus into a deficit and lay the groundwork for bigger and better deficits to come, his defense of that deficit he created was fairly unique, involving an <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/11/surplus-deficit-and-recession-wondering.html">implicit assumption of double digit GDP growth!!!</a>. (Yes, this man is now Dean of the Business School at Columbia.) I believe Hubbard was last seen co-authoring <a href="http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/null?&#038;exclusive=filemgr.download&#038;file_id=53339">a paper</a> explaining the desirability of &#8220;a 4.5 percent mortgage for homebuyers for a period of time. This bold idea, akin to our proposal on this page on October 2, would help arrest the decline in house prices and absorb excess inventory of housing.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure what &#8220;a period of time&#8221; is to Hubbard, but we had rates in that neighborhood for about six months <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/MORTG.txt">last year</a>. The rates got there shortly after the Case Schiller Home Price Index had bottomed out and started rising, and <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/SPCS20RSA.txt">right about the time the index started tanking again</a>. The index is now rising to new post-crash depths. </p>
<p>10. On the other hand, I suspect Brad DeLong might nominate <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/03/greg-mankiw-budget-arsonist-screaming-for-a-firehose.html">Greg Mankiw</a> for some sort of award among the signatories of the letter and its hard to disagree with him. FYI &#8211; my views on debt haven&#8217;t changed since <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/republican-party-and-national-debt.html">this</a>. </p>
<p>Which leads to another look at the figure I put up earlier, this time color coded by the party of the President in office. <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x8YitF78KcQ/TZnnHNDDzoI/AAAAAAAAAkk/6J4HAKUHEcQ/s1600/CEA_chairs2.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x8YitF78KcQ/TZnnHNDDzoI/AAAAAAAAAkk/6J4HAKUHEcQ/s320/CEA_chairs2.bmp"></a>Figure 2 </p>
<p>And one more thing&#8230; as Michael Kanell and I wrote in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Facts-Presidents-Measure-Issues/dp/1579128351/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1301779800&#038;sr=8-1">Presimetrics</a>, sooner or later &#8220;Democrats who make it to the Oval Office [will] realize that they are going to be tarred as fiscally irresponsible no matter what, so why make the tough decisions that Republican presidents have refused to make in recent decades?&#8221; I guess after Ford, Reagan and the two Bushes, an Obama has come home to roost.</p>

                                <p>Guest post by <strong>Michael Halasy</strong> Practicing Emergency Medicine PA, Health Policy Analyst, and Health Services Researcher</p>
<p><strong>Interstate Health Insurance Sales</strong></p>
<p>One of the more common ideas often thrown around in health policy is the idea of allowing patients to purchase health insurance across state lines. The idea of course, is to allow patients access to potentially cheaper policies, and that by increasing competition, lower rates will ensue. </p>
<p>While this does not sound like the worst idea, there are several problems with this concept, the first, and most obvious, being regulatory. Insurance plans are regulated by each state, and each state has a mandatory minimum coverage. State regulators have legal authority to oversee all insurance matters within their state boundaries, but do not have the authority to oversee out of state plans. If a patient were to purchase insurance in a neighboring state, and then have a grievance or complaint against that company, the patients legal recourse might be very limited. Additionally, if they buy plans that do not meet the minimum coverage requirements of their own state, are there potential legal problems? <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The second issue with this, is that it will create an adverse risk pooling. Out of state insurers will almost certainly offer plans to healthy, young individuals. This will leave in state insurers with a potentially sicker risk pool. What this will do is lower premiums potentially for one group of patients, but concurrently raise rates for a sicker group. Risk pooling, and spreading the risk through a group of patients is the backbone of health insurance, this could possibly interfere with this.</p>
<p>The final issue is fragmentation. In a system that is already badly fragmented, increased fragmentation reduces the leverage of insurers. In a BNET article in 2009, it was noted that the city of Milwaukee, with multiple insurers, and no dominant health insurer on the landscape, demonstrated that on average, providers would not accept less than 200% of Medicare as their reimbursement. Nearby Chicago however, with a dominant BC/BS insurance market demonstrates that on average, providers accepted 112% of Medicare as their reimbursement. The reason is simple. Leverage. Who has it? The insurers? Or, the providers? </p>
<p>Finally, perhaps the biggest issue with Interstate Health Insurance sales is that it fails to address rising costs. It will create a cost shifting onto sicker patients, and lower premiums for younger, healthier patients….but only temporarily. It will not address the continued, unsustainable rise in healthcare costs, and could create a regulatory nightmare.</p>
