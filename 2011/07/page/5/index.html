                                <p>Jobs growth is a lagging indicator of economic activity, so the June report confirms that the US economy has been in a deep rut (Marshall Auerback calls it a <a href="http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2011/07/time-to-panic-ii.html">&#8216;fully-fledged New York City style pot hole&#8217;</a>). Yes, the US economy is growing; but sub-2% really &#8216;feels&#8217; like stagnation, if not recession for many. As always, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/july-employment-situation.html">Spencer provides </a> a fantastic summary of the employment report here on AB: &#8216;bad news&#8217;, he says.</p>
<p>I call it abysmal, both relative to history and on a cross section. The chart below illustrates the unemployment rates across the G7 spanning 1995 to 2011.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XNfQYEInMw0/ThmkBEqsYII/AAAAAAAADwo/KSxNTWNEsOI/s1600/urate_chart.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XNfQYEInMw0/ThmkBEqsYII/AAAAAAAADwo/KSxNTWNEsOI/s400/urate_chart.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Across the G7 economies, the level of the US unemployment rate is second only to France. This is <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=251">true on a harmonized basis as well</a>.<br />READ MORE AFTER THE JUMP!<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The speed at which the US unemployment rate reached European levels was abrupt. Only the UK has seen such a swift deterioration in labor market conditions.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0Lwi1HVbdw0/ThmkBDWyEcI/AAAAAAAADww/rmY4HlM_e8Q/s1600/urate_chart_indexed.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0Lwi1HVbdw0/ThmkBDWyEcI/AAAAAAAADww/rmY4HlM_e8Q/s400/urate_chart_indexed.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>The chart above illustrates the same time series as in the first unemployment chart, but the rates are indexed to 2005 for comparability. France&#8217;s high level of unemployment is structural. In contrast, the US level of unemployment is NOT, not even close.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HYF2uxrdMAo/ThnNRaiG1PI/AAAAAAAADxA/ld7YTr5i0pw/s1600/protection_index.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HYF2uxrdMAo/ThnNRaiG1PI/AAAAAAAADxA/ld7YTr5i0pw/s400/protection_index.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>The chart above illustrates the components of the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/11/0,3746,en_2649_37457_42695243_1_1_1_37457,00.html">OECD&#8217;s indicators of employment protection</a>. Also, see a <a href="http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2001/swe0105c.pdf">short note by the Dallas Fed</a> highlighting the differences between the French and US labor markets (and the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/51/1941679.pdf">1994 OECD jobs study</a>).</p>
<p>The French labor market is quite rigid, which leads to a structurally elevated unemployment rate and expansive unemployment compensation (see <a href="http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2001/swe0105c.pdf">this follow up </a>to the OECD 1994 jobs strategy report). The US Labor markets is much more fluid, which is why the unemployment rate has surged relative to comparable economies in Europe (see second chart).</p>
<p>European levels of unemployment without the European safety net.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sTTR9_EF1Sk/Thnod6MlOpI/AAAAAAAADxI/-7G6yxlv2r0/s1600/benefits_CHART.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sTTR9_EF1Sk/Thnod6MlOpI/AAAAAAAADxI/-7G6yxlv2r0/s400/benefits_CHART.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>The chart illustrates the maximum number of months that a worker can claim unemployment insurance for the year 2007. In normal times, French workers can collect benefits for up to 23 months by law, where the US worker collects for just 6 months. The tax and benefit policies data are updated infrequently, and listed on the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/3/0,3746,en_2649_34637_39617987_1_1_1_1,00.html#statistics">OECD&#8217;s website</a> (<a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/38/16/44508994.xls">excel file link</a>).</p>
<p>Seriously, shouldn&#8217;t Congress be focused on the depressed state of the US labor market, rather than a &#8216;scaled back&#8217; version of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/us/politics/10debt.html?hp">deficit cutting</a>? Addressing one will clearly impact the other &#8211; it goes both ways. Unfortunately, the government&#8217;s pushing in the wrong direction (cutting deficits brings further unemployment rather reducing unemployment drops the deficits).</p>

                                <p>The employment was bad news as payroll employment only rose by 18,000 as compared to the last months disappointing rise of 25,000.  Government employment fell  39,000 versus 48,000 in<br />May.  Private payrolls expanded only 57,000 that was even weaker than the prior months 73,000.  Over the last two months payroll employment was essentially unchanged.</p>

Both the year over year and compound three month growth rate of average hourly earnings is only 1.9%. Wage growth is approaching a record low.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qkrPLjLg8XU/ThcNQQE7GkI/AAAAAAAABq0/ij1jkqJKVR4/s1600/Clipboard01%2BEMP%2B1.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qkrPLjLg8XU/ThcNQQE7GkI/AAAAAAAABq0/ij1jkqJKVR4/s320/Clipboard01%2BEMP%2B1.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>

<p>Average wekly earnings growth also continues to slow.  The year over gain is 2.5% and the three month growth rate is only 1.8%.   Actually, with oil prices falling real weekly earnings  ticked up month before last, the only gain in seven months.  But this month average weekly earnings actually fell from $652.51 to $652.18 so unless we are experiencing deflation real wages will fall again this month.  Given this weakness in wages and earnings it is extremely difficult to see where growth is going to come from.</p>

                                <p>Op ed by <strong>Nancy Ortiz</strong></p>
<p>Scott Hochberg&#8217;s article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/making-e-verify-mandatory-perfect-storm.html">Making E-Verify Mandatory: The Perfect Storm for Crippling the Social Security Administration and Jeopardizing the Social Safety Net</a> discusses issues regarding the e-Verify system and a move in Congress to make it mandatory for everyone hired for a job in the US. He points out that eVerify is every bit as much a threat to SS and Medicare as any of the other benefit, COLA, or Medicare provider cuts now being discussed. I read Hochberg&#8217;s article with great interest and have a few additional points to add to his excellent analysis of this subject.  </p>
<p>When the Immigration Reform Act took effect in 1987, I was the manager of the SS office in Northern Santa Barbara County in strawberry, broccoli, lettuce and wine grape country. Thousands of migrant workers pass through the area at the height of the picking season between January and May. Many stay with or without authorization so that about 60% of the population is Hispanic and/or non-English speaking/non-US national. You will find similar demographics up and down the California Central Coast in agricultural areas, so there&#8217;s nothing unusual about this.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll spare you the war stories of actually implementing IRCA&#8217;s social security number provisions. This was the Bush I administration notable for its parsimony in budgeting for SSA operations. (How bad was it? How about no hiring, no overtime and no photocopy paper bad?) Farm workers in the area lined up with their new Immigration work visas in hand outside our office door at 6:00A and we interviewed Social Security Number applicants until 5:00P every day from 1987 til mid-1989. It was hard to get anything else done, but the normal operation got busier because of the recession that put maybe 15% of the workforce in our area out of work.</p>
<p>Alright, now it won&#8217;t take much imagination to imagine the same situation but worse, because now every worker  would be subject to e-verify. Not just the &#8220;obvious illegals,&#8221; every single one who applied for a job. Hochberg&#8217;s article summarizes the projected workload from this but SSA&#8217;s workforce is now 20 or more years older <br />and really, really ready to retire. And, of course, Congress is talking about cutting the whole federal civil service workforce 10% across the board while maintaining an indefinite hiring freeze and whacking every agencies&#8217; budget in its 2 Trillion to 4 Trillion dollar spending cuts. The President is ready to agree to at least 2 Trillion in cuts, but discussions are continuing.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can see now why making it illegal to work in the US without lawful admission was a bad, terrible, awful, rotten, really bad idea from the git-go. &#8220;All we would have to do to&#8221; avoid this debacle is revoke this provision and we could go back to doing business the way we did before 1987. The punitive notion of making<br />work without documents a &#8220;crime&#8221; has resulted in a flood of counterfeit and stolen documents. Field workers often buy many sets of documents (at high prices) before getting a set that will pass employers&#8217; inspection. Every town in California and other border states has document mills.  Sanctions against employers for hiring undocumented workers are virtually never imposed. Identity theft, impossible to prevent and prosecute effectively, is epidemic. And, on and on. All because of the notion that working in the US should be a crime.</p>
<p>If you remain unconvinced, let me remind you that the budget for SSA&#8217;s New New Computer Center was reduced about in this last round of spending cuts. This will make it impossible to meet an early construction deadline made necessary by the fragility of the existing computer system. This is estimated to result in causing SSA&#8217;s now aged and outdated computer processing and data storage systems to collapse<br />sometime between now and 2013. 2013 is supposedly the outside range of functionality assuming nothing catastrophic (such as a major power grid black out) happens between now and then. Otherwise, it can go at any time. Finally, I don&#8217;t need to remind you of the pending DIB appeals workload of approx. 700K cases still on hand.</p>
<p>But, in closing let me ask you&#8211;can you prove you are a US citizen or lawfully admitted alien with permission to work if I ask you right this minute? No, your drivers&#8217; license isn&#8217;t enough. Your SS card isn&#8217;t ID.  You may have a US Passport but it won&#8217;t resolve the matter unless it is current. Your current or former employer&#8217;s assurance isn&#8217;t enough either.</p>
<p>Prove to me who you are or you can&#8217;t work here any more. And, it says here on this little No Match notice that you aren&#8217;t who you say you are. So, what about it? Exactly who are you anyway, Mr. Working American?</p>

                                <p>In addition to the controversy over the ARRP position on Social Security, there are other issues affecting retirement that surface via immigration legislation.  Scott Hochberg has given Angry Bear permission to post his article from this weekend from Huffington Post. (hat tip coberly)</p>
<p>Making E-Verify Mandatory: The Perfect Storm for Crippling the Social Security Administration and Jeopardizing the Social Safety Net by Scott Hochberg</p>
<p>There has been much recent buzzing about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/us/18aarp.html?_r=2"><u>AARP&#8217;s ambiguous, half-denied statements</u></a> about their (new?) willingness to cut Social Security benefits, and rightly so. As the largest membership organization of seniors in the country, AARP&#8217;s tactical gamble could be an unfortunate game-changer in any deficit deal negotiated behind closed doors in Washington.</p>
<p>But believe it or not, one of the biggest threats to Social Security this summer could come from an entirely different direction, from an initiative whose main target is not even related to social program spending. <a name="more"></a>  I&#8217;m talking about <a href="http://www.nilc.org/immsemplymnt/ircaempverif/e-verify-facts-about-2011-02-15.pdf"><u>E-Verify</u></a>, a proposed system for curbing the legal employment of every single undocumented worker in America. While seemingly immigration-related, a mandatory E-Verify program could cripple the Social Security Administration (SSA) by concurrently draining already-limited funding while imposing heavy burdens on one of the most efficient government programs in existence. Oh yes, and it would threaten the timely distribution of all new Social Security benefits.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with it, E-Verify is a tool designed to prevent the employment of undocumented workers in the United States. Employers run the personal information of new hires though the E-Verify electronic system, which is connected to the SSA master database of Americans with Social Security numbers. In its developmental stages, the program has been optional for employers, but new legislation proposed by <a href="http://lamarsmith.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=246547"><u>Rep. Lamar Smith</u></a> (R-TX) would make it mandatory. This would be dubious policy for a number of reasons, and many diverse groups, from the pro-immigrant community to businesses and agricultural companies, have come out against it.</p>
<p>One key message of these groups that is often overlooked is that E-Verify would add significant responsibilities and workload to an agency that is already overworked and underfunded. The Social Security Administration is one of the most efficient government agencies, operating at less than 1 percent overhead costs. Forcing SSA to handle the administrative nightmare of E-Verify is worse than the usual conservative position of &#8220;starving the beast&#8221; &#8212; it is more like starving the beast and making it run a marathon while carrying a 50 lb. backpack. That&#8217;s because in addition to drastically increasing the responsibilities SSA would be faced with, the agency is already dealing with massive budget cuts that limit its administrative capacity. There are three compelling lines of argument against mandatory E-Verify:</p>
<p>1. Mandatory E-Verify would cost American workers their jobs and create confusion at SSA.</p>
<p>When E-Verify finds an inconsistency between a name and that person&#8217;s work authorization, it issues a &#8220;tentative nonconfirmation&#8221; (TNC), after which an employee has several days to contact SSA or DHS to correct the error or risk losing their job. Unfortunately, a significant number of these TNCs are <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/USCIS/E-Verify/E-Verify/Final%20E-Verify%20Report%2012-16-09_2.pdf"><u>issued in error</u></a>. (<a href="http://www.maldef.org/assets/pdf/e-verify_Trasvina_testimony_HRCommittee.pdf"><u>Errors are usually due</u></a> to clerical mistakes from inputting data, especially with hard-to-spell names or ones that have been hyphenated or changed, as well as errors by the workers themselves when filling out government forms.) In 2010, of the 16 million E-verify queries by employers, 128,000 (0.8 percent of the total) required the employee to go to SSA or call DHS to fix the problem. Of those 0.8 percent errors, 0.3 percent were discovered to be in error and were later corrected. But 0.5 percent &#8212; <i>over half of all errors</i> &#8212; were falsely issued &#8220;final nonconfirmations,&#8221; essentially forcing their employer to wrongly fire them. 0.3 percent may not sound like very many, but with a total American workforce of 154 million, that translates to <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/06/e_verify.html"><u><i>over 770,000 jobs lost</i></u></a>. (Tyler Moran, Policy Director of the National Immigration Law Center, has a thorough explanation of how many workers would be affected, and why it is so hard for workers to challenge the system.)</p>
<p>So what does this mean for SSA? It translates to an already overburdened staff that now has to deal with hundreds of thousands of extra calls and office visits, sometimes entailing a lengthy review process for individual cases. In 2008, when there were only 7 million E-Verify queries, <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/oig/ADOBEPDF/A-03-09-19052.pdf"><u>88,000 people</u></a> called the 1-800 number or visited SSA due to E-Verify errors. If the program were mandatory, SSA would have to review 154 million records in the initial implementation period: if the rate of people calling SSA was the same as 2008, that would be nearly <i>2 million more calls</i> into the agency during that period alone.</p>
<p>2. SSA is already underfunded and overburdened, and cannot afford to take on the consuming and perpetual E-Verify project.</p>
<p>SSA has long been underfunded. Agency administrative expenses alone have been shorted 8 of the last 10 years (compared with the amount it requested of Congress to operate at full capacity). There was a particularly huge cut in 2011, almost a billion dollars below the required level, that was part of the last-minute compromise between Speaker Boehner and the Democrats a few months ago.</p>
<p>Because of those negotiations, SSA has already had to take several measures to limit its regular operations because it simply can&#8217;t afford them &#8212; many of which (ironically, although perhaps not unintentionally) will increase costs further. For one, last month the agency stopped sending out annual earnings statements to all workers under 65. (Leave aside the fact that they only <a href="http://newshour.tumblr.com/post/6076678767/social-security-administration-stops-sending-earnings"><u>cost SSA $30 million in 2011</u></a>, and help millions of Americans with their retirement planning while double-checking that SSA has the correct data for them.) The agency still expects that it will experience increased call volume from confused people wondering why they didn&#8217;t get their statements and hoping to confirm their information either in person or on the phone.</p>
<p>E-Verify proponents often claim, in response, that SSA would be funded to keep up with its new responsibilities. While that&#8217;s theoretically possible, it&#8217;s unlikely, given the Republicans&#8217; current impulse to cut every government program in sight. It&#8217;s easy to imagine a scenario whereby SSA is forced to cut <i>even more</i> of its regular operations in order to accommodate the new E-Verify agenda. Critical goals of the agency, such as reducing the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11125.pdf"><u>unacceptably long backlog for pending claims</u></a>, would have to be ignored further into the future. Or maybe it was the point all along to cripple the administration of Social Security benefits themselves and attack this <a href="http://strengthensocialsecurity.org/sites/default/files/SocialSecurity&#038;FutureofDemocraticParty_ShortFormREV_1.pdf"><u>extremely popular program</u></a> through the back door.</p>
<p>3. E-verify would remove millions of taxpayers from the pool that pays into Social Security, thus weakening the solvency of the Trust Fund.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen, the point of E-Verify is to remove illegal workers from legal employment, likely ending their tax contributions to Social Security and other federal revenue streams. This is a wasted opportunity, as any undocumented worker that pays taxes provides a net gain to the system (since they don&#8217;t collect benefits). As we all should know by now, undocumented workers are not going to leave the country when E-Verify comes knocking. They fill an important niche in our economy and are here to stay &#8212; the only difference is that more of them will be funneled into the underground economy, or miscategorized as (partially tax-exempt) independent contractors. One 2008 bill that would have made E-Verify mandatory without a pathway to legalization would have <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/91xx/doc9100/hr4088ltr.pdf"><u>decreased federal revenue by $22 billion</u></a> over 10 years.</p>
<p>Of the approximately 8 million undocumented workers, it is estimated that about two-thirds of them pay payroll taxes into the Social Security Trust Fund, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/02/AR2010090202673.html."><u>accounting for $12 billion in 2007</u></a>. (The Trust Fund is the total pot of surplus money paid into Social Security that is not immediately sent out as benefits, now totaling $2.7 trillion.) In sum, undocumented workers have contributed somewhere between $120 and $240 billion to the Trust Fund, accounting for 5.4 to 10.7 percent of its total assets. In addition, these workers tend to be younger than the average American, so the impact of their tax contributions will grow as the Baby Boomers retire and the percentage of seniors in America rises from 12 percent to 18 percent. According to the chief actuary of SSA, without the contributions of undocumented workers, the Trust Fund would run out of assets <i>six years earlier</i> than estimated in the 2010 Trustees Report. That&#8217;s staggering.</p>
<p>According to most experts, mandatory E-Verify wouldn&#8217;t affect those who already receive Social Security benefits, because current beneficiaries receive their checks through a mostly automatic process. But this much is sure: nearly everyone else would be affected. It is anyone&#8217;s guess how SSA would respond to being buried with new caseloads at a time when, <i>even pre-E-Verify</i>, &#8220;unprecedented workloads combined with declining budgets [have] damaged [the agency&#8217;s] service delivery,&#8221; according to the <a href="http://waysandmeans.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Moran_Embargoed_Testimony.pdf"><u>SSA Commissioner</u></a> himself. I&#8217;ll leave it to the immigration experts to suggest <a href="http://www.nilc.org/immsemplymnt/SSA_Related_Info/SSA-subcommittee-Moran-testimony-4-14-11.pdf"><u>how E-Verify needs to be improved</u></a> before making it mandatory &#8212; but for now at least, mandatory E-Verify is the surest way to threaten the social safety net with paralysis. Let&#8217;s hope that if E-Verify makes it through the Senate without comprehensive reform attached, Obama will roll out the veto on this one.</p>

<p><strong>Presidents, Tax Burdens, and the Subsequent Economic Growth</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve posted variations of the graph below a few times:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JHTw3sdoX7E/ThGrKkY5DxI/AAAAAAAAAp0/w2tJLA_w64A/s1600/kimel1.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JHTw3sdoX7E/ThGrKkY5DxI/AAAAAAAAAp0/w2tJLA_w64A/s320/kimel1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>The graph shows the change in the tax burden (i.e., current federal receipts / GDP) from the year before an administration took office to its second year in office on one axis, and the annualized growth in real GDP from its second year to its last year in office on the other axis.  So, to use GW as an example, the graph shows the change in Federal Receipts / GDP from 2000 to 2002 on one axis and the growth rate in real GDP from 2002 to 2008 on the other axis. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>JFK and LBJ are bunched together because LBJ took over during JFK&#8217;s term, and the two together served eight years.  Ditto Nixon/Ford.  Truman, on the other hand, took over less than three months into FDR&#8217;s fourth term, and then served just shy of eight years on his own.  I figured that was enough to qualify as Truman&#8217;s own administration.  FDR&#8217;s 12 years in office are broken into two administrations:  through 1940, and 1941 &#8211; 1944.  1941-1944, being the World War 2 years, are sufficiently different in terms of focus and goals to qualify as a different administration.</p>
<p>The graph is rather busy.  Removing the names of the Presidents (I&#8217;ve left 3 for which reasons which will become evident later), and using Excel to add a trendline may make things a bit more clear.  </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oI_tjYcyse0/ThGrk7C7C8I/AAAAAAAAAp8/ik0t41C6R6Y/s1600/kimel2.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oI_tjYcyse0/ThGrk7C7C8I/AAAAAAAAAp8/ik0t41C6R6Y/s320/kimel2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>The graph makes a point that would be controversial if people were aware of it, namely that in general, the more an administration reduced tax collections during its first two years in office, the faster the growth rate during its remaining years in office. (Rdan&#8230;One word correction)</p>
<p>This result contradicts the beliefs of most people who have taken an economics course in this country, and anyone who listens to Rush Limbaugh or watches Fox News.  But the fit is surprisingly tight considering how few variables are involved.  It doesn&#8217;t matter who believes it, or whether we are happy with this result.  I personally would much prefer to see lower taxes leading to faster economic growth than slower economic growth, but reality is what it is, not what we want it to be. </p>
<p>Now, if this is true, how does it work?  Well, it could be that changes in the tax burden in years 0 to 2 economic growth in later years.  (That isn&#8217;t controversial, even if the direction that the data is.)  But I suspect there is more at stake.  The tax burden often moves, sometimes by quite a bit, even when there has been no change in marginal tax rates.  I think a lot of the change has to do with regulation and enforcement.  An administration that cuts tax burdens is reducing regulatory tax burdens and perhaps cutting enforcement, and not just at the IRS.  A big part of that has to do with the ideology of the administration, which in turn affects who it places in key positions.  The people GW brought into his administration are very different from the people FDR selected.  And a tiger doesn&#8217;t change its stripes&#8230; an administration staffed by people who believe in reducing regulation in year 1 is going to be staffed by people who believe in reducing regulation in year 7.</p>
<p>Sadly, I now have to repeat something that keeps coming up every time I make this point.   I get comments and/or e-mails and/or even people telling me in person that what is happening is that slower growth is leading to lower tax collections.  Returning to the GW illustration, if you really believe that mediocre growth from 2002 to 2008 caused the reduction in tax burdens from 2000 to 2002,  you may have what it takes to write for the National Review or the Heritage Foundation.  I&#8217;m not impressed by arguments based on time travel, nor am I in a position to hire.  </p>
<p>Before we go on, some housecleaning.  Nominal and real GDP come from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>.  GDP was first computed in 1929, so the first complete administration for which we have data is FDR I.  Data on the Federal government&#8217;s tax receipts comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N#S3">NIPA Table 3.2</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to indicating that the administrations that produced faster growth tended to be the ones that started off by raising tax burdens, the graphs tells us a few things.  Many of these things are about the media and the education system in this country, as what the data shows tends to be a surprise to most people.  The fastest growth occurred during World War 2, which is also when the economy could best be described as a command economy.  (Think tax rates above 90%, rationing, government directives, etc.)  The years from 1932 &#8211; 1940, widely perceived as being a period of slow growth, actually had the fastest peace time growth for any period for which we have data.  (The economic collapse of the Great Depression occurred before FDR took office.)  </p>
<p>But is this all an anomaly?  Some artifact of the data?   Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think so.  See, the graphs provide a bit of evidence that indicates the theory is actually more robust than it looks.  Consider the following reasonable assumptions:</p>
<p>1.  changes in the tax burden are indicative of behavior of the administration<br />2.  the sorts of policies and behavior that affect of the economy don&#8217;t change over the length of an administration (i.e., the tiger doesn&#8217;t change its stripes)<br />3.  the economy is affected by more than just the current administration&#8217;s behavior<br />4.  some policies can take a while to have an effect</p>
<p>Assuming all of that, one would think that the longer an administration was in office, the more likely it is that its growth would tend toward what &#8220;it should be&#8221; given its policies.  Put another way, the biggest outliers should be the four year administrations.  A glance at Figure 2 tells you immediately that this is, indeed, the case.  FDR&#8217;s WW2 years, Bush 1, and Carter are the outliers.  And eliminating those outliers and focusing exclusively on the eight year administrations does, indeed, strengthen the model, as theory would suggest:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YpL7H9A1tUU/ThGsr8LGvAI/AAAAAAAAAqM/vplYVpAhD2Q/s1600/kimel3.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YpL7H9A1tUU/ThGsr8LGvAI/AAAAAAAAAqM/vplYVpAhD2Q/s320/kimel3.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3.  </p>
<p>So what we&#8217;re left is increasing evidence that the more an administration cuts the tax burden in its first two years in office, the slower the growth it produces thenceforth.  And again, you don&#8217;t have to like this result (I personally don&#8217;t) for it to be true.  </p>
<p>All of which brings us back to Barack Obama, who is not on any of these graphs.  Now, Obama inherited an economic disaster, but that&#8217;s the past.  He campaigned for the right to be the one making the decisions, and he got it.  And what matters is whether he makes things better.  FDR inherited a much worse economic mess, and went on to produce growth the likes of which haven&#8217;t seen since.  So&#8230; any chance Obama is going to pull an FDR?  In a word, no.  Whereas FDR raised the tax burden by more than any other President for whom we have data during his first two years in office, Obama has reduced the tax burden by about 1.2 percentage points.  That puts him between Ike and Nixon/Ford when it comes to changes in the tax burden over the first two years.  And both Ike and Nixon/Ford went on to produce subpar growth.  So, barring some fortuitous change that has nothing to do with Obama, we can&#8217;t expect much more than mediocre growth for the remainder of Obama&#8217;s time in office.  But I don&#8217;t expect his eventual challenger to learn anything from the three figures in this post either.  None of this bodes well for America.  </p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ll make this quick, since I&#8217;m going to get in trouble for writing on a national holiday. But the pace of annual jobs growth is too slow to generate strong wage and salary income. Much empirical research has been dedicated to the estimation of consumption functions, generally finding that labor income is the primary driver of consumption (here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2001/200109/200109pap.pdf">primer at the Federal Reserve Board</a>). However, by extension jobs growth is highly correlated with wage and salary growth, roughly 50% of personal income &#8211; this is the relationship I analyze here.</p>
<p>Roughly half of the <a href="http://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/pi/2011/pdf/pi0511.pdf">BEA&#8217;s measure of personal income</a> comes in the form of wage and salary, so called labor income and simply referred to as &#8216;wages&#8217; from here on out. This is highly correlated with nonfarm payroll growth, both in nominal and real terms (92% and 79%, respectively, since 1996). The chart below illustrates the correlation between real wage growth and nonfarm payroll since 1982 (I use real wage so as to account for the effects of inflation).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jCZR1i0ppjU/ThG01ErmhII/AAAAAAAADug/GFcm2gEmIys/s1600/payroll_rwage_chart.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jCZR1i0ppjU/ThG01ErmhII/AAAAAAAADug/GFcm2gEmIys/s400/payroll_rwage_chart.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The annual pace of real wage gains and jobs growth have declined over time (jobs growth is measured using the nonfarm payroll). Simply eyeballing the data, there&#8217;s a structural shift roughly around 1996, as listed in the table below.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2ykpmwz2oP4/ThG2HXuFuPI/AAAAAAAADuo/KyS6SJkSS8A/s1600/table_wages_payroll.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2ykpmwz2oP4/ThG2HXuFuPI/AAAAAAAADuo/KyS6SJkSS8A/s400/table_wages_payroll.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Using these two time periods, 1982-1995 and 1996-05/2011, I estimate a simple model of real wage growth on nonfarm payroll growth. The chart for the 1996-2011 model is illustrated below; and for reference, the regression results across both time periods are copied at the end of this post.</p>
<p>READ MORE AFTER THE JUMP!<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Note: I do not have time for a full blown econometric analysis. I did, however, perform statistical tests for serial correlation in the errors, unit roots in the transformed data (none), and general modeling tests.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Xn1ePnaMRyc/ThHRWxhBKuI/AAAAAAAADvY/7c98PnelgRo/s1600/model_1996.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Xn1ePnaMRyc/ThHRWxhBKuI/AAAAAAAADvY/7c98PnelgRo/s400/model_1996.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>I come to two general conclusions regarding the relationship between real wage growth and jobs growth over time:</p>
<p>(1) Real wage growth has become more persistent over time. In the first period, 1982-1995, just one lag was required to expunge the errors of autocorrelation. Spanning the second period, 1996-2011, three lags were required. The sum of the coefficients on the three lags is 0.87 in the later sample, or current wage growth is highly dependent on previous periods &#8211; sticky if you will.</p>
<p>(2) Nonfarm payroll growth has become less significant over time. Spanning the years 1982-1995, the coefficient on annual payroll growth was 0.27 &#8211; for each 1pps increase in the annual payroll growth, the trajectory of annual real wage growth increased by 0.27pps. The coefficient dropped to 0.17 in the sample spanning 1996-2011. This is probably a consequence of service sector jobs growing as a share of the labor market. I&#8217;d like your ideas in comments as well.</p>
<p>Clearly this is a very simple model but it does highlight that wages are likely stuck in the mud for some time. In May, annual real wages fell 0.6% over the year, having decelerated for 5 of the 7 months since November 2010. Real wages can pick up, but it takes time AND jobs growth faster than the 0.67% annual pace in May 2011.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what this analysis tells me is with wealth effects slowing markedly &#8211; the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SPX:IND">trajectory of the S&#038;P</a> decelerated and house prices <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-28/home-prices-in-u-s-cities-decreased-4-in-april-from-year-ago.html">continue to fall</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s going to take a burst of payroll growth to get real wage and salary growth back on track enough to finance US domestic consumption. One caveat to all of this negativity is that <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=USCRWTIC:IND">oil prices are coming off</a> &#8211; this will boost real wage and salary growth directly.</p>
<p>Rebecca Wilder<br />P.S. I guess this turned out somewhat less &#8216;quick&#8217; than I had anticipated &#8211; not in trouble yet! Gotta go.</p>

<p><strong>I Beg to Differ (in Part), Mr. Will</strong></p>
<p>A few days ago I posted a post on my blog that responds to George Will’s claim in his weekend<a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/burning-down-the-house/2011/06/30/AGeRSGuH_story.html?hpid=z2"> Washington Post column</a> that the auto bailout was a privatization of profits but a socialization of losses.  The full post, which is at <a target="_blank" href="http://annarborist.blogspot.com/2011/07/i-beg-to-differ-in-part-mr-will.html">Annarborist</a>, and is called <em>I Beg to Differ (in Part) Mr. Will</em>, George Will says:    </p>
<blockquote><p>In 1994, Bill Clinton proposed increasing homeownership through a ‘partnership’ between government and the private sector, principally orchestrated by Fannie Mae, a “government-sponsored enterprise” (GSE). It became a perfect specimen of what such “partnerships” (e.g., General Motors) usually involve: Profits are private, losses are socialized.</p></blockquote>
<p>—“Burning Down the House,” George F. Will, Washington Post, June 30  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Will’s column discusses a new book by Getchen Morgenson and housing-finance expert Joshua Rosner that Will says “will introduce you to James A. Johnson, an emblem of the administrative state that liberals admire.”  Johnson, for those of you who (like me) don’t instantly recognize the name, headed Fannie Mae during (I guess; Will doesn’t specify the dates) during the 1990s and early 2000s.  He says the book details how Johnson and a few others, acting under the guise of compassion, used the government’s backing of Fannie and Freddie loans and the public policy of encouraging homeownership, to hugely enrich themselves.   </p>
<p>Will writes:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Morgenson and Rosner report that in 1998, when Fannie Mae’s lending hit $1 trillion, its top officials began manipulating the company’s results to generate bonuses for themselves. That year Johnson’s $1.9 million bonus brought his compensation to $21 million. In nine years, Johnson received $100 million.  </p>
<p>Fannie Mae’s political machine dispensed campaign contributions, gave jobs to friends and relatives of legislators, hired armies of lobbyists (even paying lobbyists not to lobby against it), paid academics who wrote papers validating the homeownership mania, and spread “charitable” contributions to housing advocates across the congressional map.</p></blockquote>
<p>But he also suggests, if I understand correctly, that it was Johnson and the other Fannie and Freddie folks, rather than the Wall Street crowd, who instituted the concept of securitized mortgages and credit default swaps—and (inferentially) then caused European banks to spur, say, the Irish housing bubble, which, last I heard, was not funded in any part by Fannie and Freddie.  And he wrote the quote that opens this post, in which he claims that the government’s bailout—loans, most of which have been repaid—to GM and Chrysler have resulted in merely private profits.  Unlike, y’know, the very substantial tax breaks given to oil companies.  </p>
<p>The estimates about the number of jobs saved by those bailouts ranges from about 500,000 to (ultimately; i.e., indirectly) 1.5 million.  Will is saying, in other words, that the federal government has no legitimate business involving itself so directly in the preservation of, or for that matter, the creation of jobs, because, after all, job preservation and job creation are private, not public, financial gains.  The proposition is preposterous and relies upon the sleight of hand that only <i>company and shareholder profits</i> count as “profits”—a conceit that is likely to be seen for what it is, in places like Michigan, Indiana and Ohio.  Assuming, of course, that Will is read in such places, or that some other wingnut picks up the argument and runs (literally, may) be with it there.  <br />(Please, please, Paul Krugman.  Respond to Will’s bizarre claim.  You’re the only one who could do this and who has a wide enough readership for it to matter.  We both know that no response to this type of canard will be forthcoming from the White House.  Ever.  Okay, well, at least until 2017.)  </p>
<p>Two or three weeks ago, <em>Newsweek</em> ran a lengthy article by Bill Clinton listing 14 proposals for job creation.  (Oh, for the days when the Democrat in the White House had some actual ideas, some energy, and the willingness—the eagerness, in fact!—to discuss his policy proposals, in detail and concertedly, with the public.)  One of them concerned one of the Obama administrations (very) few policy ideas: Substantial tax credits and outright loans to green-tech startups, which resulted in an increase in America’s share of worldwide production of batteries for battery-powered cars from 2% to 20% before until our dear leader quietly—why raise this issue publicly during negotiations when it’s just so much easier to simply give the Republicans what they want—caved, er, negotiated away this law during last December’s budget white-flag waving, er, compromise.  Clinton, of course, suggests that this program should be brought back, immediately, and expanded to other types of industries.  </p>
<p>Won’t happen, of course.  Well, maybe in 2017.  </p>
<p>As for Johnson and his ilk, hopefully there’s still time, statute-of-limitations-wise, to prosecute these folks.  And hopefully, the Morgenson and Rosner book will cause enough pressure for that to happen.  And I agree with Will completely that one of the most despicable aspects of what happened with Fannie and Freddie was the fraudulent claim of compassion.  Wonder, though, whether Will would agree with ME that the Repubs’ genuine compassion for, say, oil company execs and shareholders is just as unseemly, in its own way.  Nah.</p>

                                <p>I suggest these questions, but this is not a question about ideal jobs in imagination but real jobs that are attainable.</p>
<p>I think all of us have some notion of what elements constitute a &#8216;good&#8217; job in the broad perspective (policy and macro), and given human nature varies according to personal goals, age, and circumstance. It has also varied widely in historical context. The term is used a lot in policy debates on employment and unemployment as well.</p>
<p>It is much easier to reach a consensus on the definition of a bad job than to agree on what constitutes a good job.</p>
<p>Is a good job one in a particular industry or sector?</p>
<p>The question of the length of employment contracts matters?</p>
<p>Is a good job one that comes with employer-provided benefits?</p>
<p>What is the relationship between wages and the definition of a good job?</p>
<p>A final question about the definition of a good job involves the relationship of the worker to the employer.</p>
<p>Personal satisfaction of some kind?  Social status? Conscience?</p>
