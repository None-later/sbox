<blockquote><p>PIGNAL: This is actually the second bailout for Dexia. In 2008, it had to be bailed out after exceptionally imprudent investing, including in U.S. subprime mortgages. This time around, it was basically dealing with the legacy of the past, and it was trying to do what it could to get back into safer waters. But with the Eurozone debt crisis in the past year, it basically ran out of time. </p>
<p>SIEGEL: <strong><em>Yeah, that was the past. This is now.</em></strong> And if the 12th most secure bank in Europe just collapsed, does that mean that several more bank collapses are in store? [idiocy emphasized by me]</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what happens when you try Extend and Pretend while leaving the Management (think Pandit, Moynihan) who screwed up in the first place in charge of the burning building.</p>

<p><strong>ARITHMETIC MATTERS</strong></p>
<p>I was thinking that someone could fault my essay the other day about the “Intelligence Squared” debate.  I said that Howard Dean’s side did not really help anyone understand why, or what, or how to “save the program.”  I hope I helped explain the why and what, but I probably wasn’t any more clear than Dean about  how.</p>
<p>This will attempt to address that. Recall the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/312411#ixzz1a6qBaLMN%3Cbr%20/%3E">original article about the debate</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>Arithmetic still matters,&#8221; Zuckerman began. &#8220;Medicaid now pays for both health and long term care for roughly 55 million Americans. It finances more than one third of all births in the United States, and pays the cost of almost two thirds of the people in nursing homes. The federal government underwrites 50 to 77 percent of the cost, depending on the income level of each state. Even so, Medicaid is the second biggest and fastest growing category of state spending. Costs are up more than 60 percent in the last five years and are expected to exceed $450 billion this year and to keep growing by about eight percent annually for the next decade. In the next &#8212; by the mid-2030s, the 65 and over population will nearly double, and health care costs, which have been rising far faster than worker productivity since the end of World War II, may be completely out of control, resulting in a tidal wave of federal spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps arithmetic still matters, but Zuckerman is careful to avoid giving us any.  Instead he seduces us down a path that begins with apparent sober numerical facts and ends with pure demagoguery.</p>
<p>You need to learn to beware of words like “costs are up more than 60%”&#8230; <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Sixty percent of what?  If Medicare costs went up 60%, they would go from 3% of payroll to about 5%.  This might be more than you want to pay.  It might even be more than it should be.  But it is not exactly an intolerable burden if that’s what it costs to live a longer and healthier life.</p>
<p>But, just as a matter of “arithmetic,” note how a 2% increase in costs becomes a scary “60% increase.”  This is typical of the “it’s just math” school of liars.</p>
<p>Similarly, the rest of Zuckerman’s seduction presents numbers intended to scare you into thinking that Medicaid costs are high and growing alarmingly.  It would be just as reasonable to think that health care costs are high and will get higher, and that government programs are the best way people have to pay for them. Or even that government needs to step in and find a way to control costs (which is not the same as cut benefits).</p>
<p>But finally we reach the payoff.: be afraid of costs “completely out of control”  and “a tidal wave of Federal spending.&#8221;</p>
<p>None of the “arithmetic” Zuckerman  gives us here actually supports that scary rhetoric.  His theorem amounts to:  “If costs are going up, we must cut our insurance.”</p>
<p>I don’t know how much costs are going to go up.  Neither does Zuckerman.  But I can suggest that you try to find out what costs are now in terms of your own personal budget, and what they are likely to be in terms of your personal budget at some reasonable time in the future.  And what the estimate is based on.  And whether it is a cost you are going to have to pay one way or another&#8230; either through taxes or private insurance or out of pocket. Don’t forget this is insurance.  You may be healthy today,  but with insurance you are paying a little bit now “just in case” you are faced with life or death huge costs&#8230;personal costs&#8230;in the future.</p>
<p>And what is the safest way to pay for them.  Private insurance cannot guarantee that it will be able to pay for your care, even after you have paid premiums for your entire life.  The government can.  </p>
<p>There is also some reason to suppose that the government might be in a better position to control prices than private insurance. But only  as long as we can remind the government that we are paying for our own insurance here, and not just some budget item they can cut  “to balance income”  with no consequences to the people who thought they were paying for insurance that would be there when they need it.</p>
<p>Pay as you go is the only way that I can think of to make this work.  Under  pay as you go the people just pay for current costs.  Their own future costs will be higher, so they are not bearing an unfair burden. Their own future costs will be paid for (directly) by the workers of that time&#8230; who will have higher wages and will be more able to afford it.  Those future workers own higher costs in turn will be paid for by the workers of that later time&#8230; who will have higher wages&#8230; and so on.</p>
<p>Perhaps the process can’t go on forever.  But it can go on a lot longer than retired people can afford to pay each month for the “insurance” that would pay for their current level of risk. The ultimate answer to high costs is to find a way to control them, and to decide how much of your current income you are willing to set aside for what level of health care you may want in the future. Please note there is no &#8220;looming deficit&#8221; here. We just pay the costs as they come up.  The magic of pay as you go will assure than none of us pay more than our own &#8220;expected&#8221; costs.  The fact that we are paying in advance of our own need does not mean that we are paying for &#8220;someone else&#8221; or that we are not paying for ourself.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the whole health care arithmetic will turn out to be when it is done by someone honest, but I can point at something which may be important to keep in mind:</p>
<p>Table VI.F2 of the 2011 Trustees Report tells us that the cost of Medicare (HI) in 2030 will be about 4.4% of taxable payroll, compared to about 3.8% today. This looks to me like about a half of one percent increase in your payroll tax, and half of that will be paid by your boss.  That is not a staggering burden. [It might be more reasonable to compare the future cost to the present tax rate.. 2.9%, half from the worker, half from the boss.  This would suggest a need to raise the tax 1.5% over the next 20 years.  That would be less than half of one tenth of one percent per year for each the boss and the employee&#8230;.still not a staggering burden.  And it goes to pay for your own eventual health care needs.]</p>
<p>Moreover, the real wage is expected to increase at least 1.2% per year between today and 2030.  This would result in a real wage that is about 25% higher in 2030 than it is today.</p>
<p>Lets say that today you are making 1000 dollars per week.  You are paying 1.45% for Medicare or about $14.50 per month. (your boss pays another $14.50, but if you want to say that is “really” your money, you need to add $14.50 to your income. )  This leaves you with about $986 a week after you have paid for your Medicare.</p>
<p>In 2030, your income would be 1,250 dollars per week (real).  And if there were no increase in the Medicare tax rate, your tax would be $18.12, leaving you with $1232 per week after you have paid for Medicare.</p>
<p>If the cost of Medicare goes up to 4.4% of taxable payroll and the tax rate is raised to meet the cost, your share goes up to 2.2%, and you would pay $27.50 per week for Medicare, leaving you with about $1222 after paying for your Medicare.</p>
<p>So even with the increased cost of Medicare, you would have 236 dollars in real money more than you have today AFTER paying for your Medicare.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other taxes,  but the arithmetic is the same.  After calculating the increased costs, and your expected increase in wages, you are going to be richer in the future, not staggering under a load of “debt”.</p>
<p>All you have to do is pay for what YOU ARE GOING TO NEED.  You are not “paying for granny.”  Granny already paid for herself.  </p>
<p>Note that even if costs for health care go up faster than your wages &#8230; in real terms&#8230;  you are still paying for something you may want more than a new car when you get sick.</p>
<p>I suggest this is the real arithmetic you need to keep in mind.</p>

<p>This is from Jialan Wang:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://econerdfood.blogspot.com/2011/10/benfords-law-and-decreasing-reliability.html">Benford&#8217;s Law and the Decreasing Reliability of Accounting Data for US Firms, by Jialan Wang</a>: &#8230;[T]here are more numbers in the universe that begin with the digit 1 than 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6, or 7, or 8, or 9. And more numbers that begin with 2 than 3, or 4, and so on. This relationship holds for the lengths of rivers, the populations of cities, molecular weights of chemicals, and any number of other categories. &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This numerical regularity is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law">Benford&#8217;s Law</a>, and specifically, it says that the probability of the first digit from a set of numbers is <em>d</em> is given by</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>In fact, Benford&#8217;s law has been used in legal cases to detect corporate fraud, because deviations from the law can indicate that a company&#8217;s books have been manipulated. Naturally, I was keen to see whether it applies to the large public firms that we commonly study in finance.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>downloaded quarterly accounting data for all firms in Compustat,&#8230; over 20,000 firms from SEC filings&#8230; (revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, etc.).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>And lo, it works! Here are the distribution of first digits vs. Benford&#8217;s law&#8217;s prediction for total assets&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HT-hDx8Pkh0/TpJvSFIi6sI/AAAAAAAAAzw/Dmi8-wktQMQ/s1600/atq_dist.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HT-hDx8Pkh0/TpJvSFIi6sI/AAAAAAAAAzw/Dmi8-wktQMQ/s320/atq_dist.jpg" width="320" height="232"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Next, I looked at how adherence to Benford&#8217;s law changed over time, using a measure of the sum of squared deviations of the empirical density from the Benford&#8217;s prediction&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Deviations from Benford&#8217;s law have increased substantially over time, such that today the empirical distribution of each digit is about 3 percentage points off from what Benford&#8217;s law would predict. The deviation increased sharply between 1982-1986 before leveling off, then zoomed up again from 1998 to 2002.  Notably, the deviation from Benford dropped off very slightly in 2003-2004 after the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley accounting reform act in 2002, but this was very tiny and the deviation resumed its increase up to an all-time peak in 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tl4Xwb1yWgY/TpJvRYB2YKI/AAAAAAAAAzo/JzfregzopWA/s1600/benf_year.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tl4Xwb1yWgY/TpJvRYB2YKI/AAAAAAAAAzo/JzfregzopWA/s400/benf_year.jpg" width="400" height="290"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>So according to Benford&#8217;s law, accounting statements are getting less and less representative of what&#8217;s really going on inside of companies.The major reform that was passed after Enron and other major accounting standards barely made a dent.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Next, I looked at Benford&#8217;s law for three industries: finance, information technology, and manufacturing. &#8230; [<a href="http://econerdfood.blogspot.com/2011/10/benfords-law-and-decreasing-reliability.html">shows graphs</a>] &#8230; While these time series don&#8217;t prove anything decisively, deviations from Benford&#8217;s law are compellingly correlated with known financial crises, bubbles, and fraud waves. And overall, the picture looks grim. Accounting data seem to be less and less related to the natural data-generating process that governs everything from rivers to molecules to cities. Since these data form the basis of most of our research in finance, Benford&#8217;s law casts serious doubt on the reliability of our results. And it&#8217;s just one more reason for investors to beware&#8230;.</p></blockquote>

<p>The GOP has made lots of fusses lately about the deficit. According to the party line, earned benefits that Americans rely on for health care and retirement income just &#8220;have&#8221; to be reduced, no matter how painful it is to the GOP-controlled House to do it, because of the unrelenting deficits that are destroying the US economy.</p>
<p>How then can any GOP member of the House think it is reasonable to introduce legislation that institutes a permanent tax cut that will cost the government billions will benefitting primarily the very rich investors in corporate stock?<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Peter Roskam (Republican from Illinois and member of the House Ways and Means Committee) introduced legislation&#8211;<a href="http://taxandaccounting.bna.com/btac/T11100/split_display.adp?fedfid=23091757&#038;vname=dtrnot&#038;fn=23091757&#038;jd=a0c9g2p1x1&#038;split=0">H.R. 3091</a> (for those with BNA access)&#8211; on Tuesday that would make the ridiculously low Bush tax legislation provisions for capital gains and dividends permanent. A 15% rate on the main source of income that the uberrich enjoy, while the rest of us pay regular ordinary income rates on our wages.</p>
<p>How does Roskam justify this further giveaway to the rich, this further example of governmental capture by oligarchy? He claims that this revenue reduction that benefits mostly the very rich will &#8211;yes, you guessed it&#8211;help generate U.S. investment and create jobs. Making this giveaway rate permanent for everybody will &#8220;foster a culture that encourages investment, capital formation, and economic growth&#8221;, he says. BNA Daily Tax Report, Oct. 5, 2011.</p>
<p>Balderdash. Low capital gains rates have nothing to do with encouraging investment or capital formation or job creation. They mostly reward investors in the secondary market on their trades. They let the rich get even richer and make more investments&#8211;probably in emerging markets rather than in the US.</p>
<p>It is true that having more cash on hand because you didn&#8217;t pay as much taxes means you&#8217;d have more to spend. So why not encourage economic growth by putting cash in the hands of the middle and lower income classes through the payroll tax reduction proposed by Obama? (Yes, it should be temporary&#8211;as an economic stimulus.)</p>
<p>This is just another example of class warfare in action in the right-leaning House GOP. All the fuss about deficits. All the economic terrorism about the U.S. debt limit. But reducing revenues still more in order to benefit the wealthy&#8211;well, the Mr. R. just can&#8217;t wait to do that one.</p>

<p>THE THIRD BATTLE OF MANASSAS AND WHAT WALL STREET PROTESTORS SHOULD ASK FOR</p>
<p>Although the mainstream media has widely reported the photogenic and growing Wall Street protest movement, and many bloggers have cheered on the demonstrators, no one can explain what these idealists hope to achieve.  Yes, they’ve drawn attention to pervasive greed among elites, growing income inequality and widespread unemployment, among other ills.  And, the protestors chose Wall Street as the appropriate point of departure for an evolving national movement.  So, it is fitting that their goals be directed toward Wall Street and its allies on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.   <br />So, what should the demonstrators demand? And what do Civil War battles fought near the Virginia town of Manassas have to do with it? History can wait.  Let’s first make a list of demands.  To do so, consider the views of people with the gray hair, financial experience, academic credentials and real world orientation to know of what they speak.   <br />Demand Return of Old Time Religion    <br />As readers of Ron Susskind’s “Confidence Men” and daily newspapers are aware, some of the problems we now face stem from tragic changes and lapses in the financial regulatory system.  With that in mind, here’s stab at a laundry list of changes &#8212; including a return to that old time religion that worked well for the sixty years between the Great Depression and President Clinton’s signing of the Gramm Bliley Act on November 12, 1999 that deregulated much of banking: <a name="more"></a>
<ol>
<li>The Feds should start enforcing the laws already on the books against misrepresentation in the sale of financial instruments including mortgage back securities and derived products and abusive mortgage lending practices aimed at unsophisticated consumers.  Such conduct was illegal before the financial meltdown and remains illegal today.  Yet, the protestors are not the only ones in America who believe violators of these laws still hold senior executive positions and still earn bloated rewards – even as Main Street crashed.  Some identifiable perps can and should be prosecuted for misdeeds to set an example for the future and (at the very least) suggest all may well be equal under the law in the United States. The five year federal statute of limitations for prosecutions remains open from 2007 onward.  I refer readers to Nobel winner Paul Krugman and his recent column:  “Confronting the Malefactors.”  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/opinion/krugman-confronting-the-malefactors.html?hp">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/opinion/krugman-confronting-the-malefactors.html?hp</a></li>
</ol>
<ol start="start">
<li>As the lion of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, and others have been saying for several years, it is time to restore the Glass Steagall Act’s separation of commercial banking from investment banking. Congress and the Clintonites (in unholy alliance with then Senator Phil Gramm, R-TX and now Governor Rick Perry’s adviser-mentor) made a serious and very expensive blunder in gutting Glass Steagall. Here’s what Volcker, the real “Maestro” of the Fed, said in 2009 testimony (that remains valid):   “I would exclude from commercial banking institutions, which are potential beneficiaries of official (i.e., taxpayer) financial support, certain risky activities entirely suitable for [for others in] our capital markets. Ownership or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds should be among those prohibited activities. So should in my view a heavy volume of proprietary trading with its inherent risks. . . . [These non-commercial banking activities have created] deep-seated, almost unmanageable, conflicts of interest with normal banking relationships – individuals, businesses, investment management clients seeking credit, underwriting and unbiased advisory services.”</li>

<ol start="start">
<li>President Obama should talk the talk and walk the walk of real change. He could do worse than studying and acting upon the words of Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Volcker (even if his re-election campaign is asking Wall Street barons for contributions.)  Even this late in his term (and within our evolving “Great Contraction” of an economic crisis), the President can use his bully pulpit to again inspire people and re-ignite the populist magic that drew tens of thousands (including my family and me) to his final 2008 campaign speech held late at night in Virginia – an event I called the third battle of Manassas, because the rally was held a couple miles from the fields where two great Civil War armies clashed.   In other words, the President could again call for systemic reforms and hire advisors who can help plan and execute them.  I refer to the experts on the overarching goals and rhetorical themes of such a campaign:</li>
</ol>
<p>Columbia University Professor and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz:  </p>
<p>&#8220;The financial sector’s inexcusable recklessness, given free rein by mindless deregulation, was the obvious precipitating factor of the crisis. The legacy of excess real-estate capacity and over-leveraged households makes recovery all the more difficult. . . .  The prescription for what ails the global economy follows directly from the diagnosis: strong government expenditures, aimed at facilitating restructuring, promoting energy conservation, and reducing inequality, and a reform of the global financial system.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stiglitz143/English">http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stiglitz143/English</a></p>
<p>Paul Volcker, again:  “There are some on ‘Wall Street’ who would like to return to ‘business as usual’. After all, for a time, and for some that system was enormously remunerative. However, it placed at risk not only the American economy, but also large parts of the world economy. The challenge is not to paper over or tinker around the edges of the broken system.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/db7fafe2-a90b-11de-b8bd-00144feabdc0.pdf">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/db7fafe2-a90b-11de-b8bd-00144feabdc0.pdf</a></p>
<p>4.  The President and Congress should restore to the American people the legal rights to hold accountable those who defraud and otherwise abuse them. With respect to Wall Street and corporate financial practices, that will require politicians with the guts to override a few Supreme Court decisions. On this one, I defer to the little-known (outside securities law circles) but eminently qualified James Cox, professor of law at Duke University.  He is currently a member of the Standing Advisory Group of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and former member of the New York Stock Exchange Legal Advisory Committee and the National Association of Securities Dealers Legal Advisory Board.  In June, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee the following: <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/11-6-29%20Cox%20Testimony.pdf">http://judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/11-6-29%20Cox%20Testimony.pdf</a></p>
<p>“No principle is more ingrained in western civil and criminal law than that individuals and entities that wrongfully harm another should bear the consequences of their misconduct. However, a perusal of law reports reflects that this principle does not apply when the misconduct is securities fraud.</p>
<p>A few cases &#8212; (each influenced by Central Bank and Stoneridge [two Supreme Court decisions that together eliminated private liability for those who knowingly aid and abet securities fraud] &#8212; illustrate this outlier characteristic. Corporations whose executives knowingly prepared false documents to conceal from their customer’s auditors that $17 million dollars in the customer’s revenues were fraudulent “roundtrip transactions” and did so to retain the customer as a client are not responsible to investors who purchased the customer’s shares at prices inflated due to the fraudulent roundtrip transactions.  Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC. v. ScientificAtlanta, Inc., 552 U.S. 148 (2008).</p>
<p>The president of a newspaper subsidiary who fraudulently inflates the number of </p>
<p>subscribers and revenues for the subsidiary is not liable to those who purchased the parent company’s shares at prices inflated as a consequence of the president’s reporting chicanery having been incorporated into the consolidated financial statements issued by the parent. Pugh v. Tribune Co., 521 F.3d 686 (7 th Cir. 2008).</p>
<p>The outside lawyer who on 17 different occasions engineered on behalf of the </p>
<p>client [Refco, the once giant derivatives dealer] fraudulent sham transactions for the purpose of concealing in various offering documents that the client firm had massive trading losses and was unable to repay millions of dollars due on margin was not liable as a primary participant to investors who suffered significant losses upon the ultimate bankruptcy of Refco. Pacific Investment Management Company LLC v. Mayer Brown LLP, 603 F.3d 144 (2010).</p>
<p>The above cases are leading cases in this area, but they are not aberrations. Indeed, each of the above cases is consistent with [the June 13, 2011] Supreme Court decision, Janus Capital Groups, Inc., v. First Derivative Traders, 2011 WL 2297762 (S. Ct. 2011).  The issue in Janus Capital was whether the investment advisor who prepared the prospectus issued by Janus Investment Fund was responsible for misstatements contained in the prospectus. The divided (5 to 4) court held that the advisor „did not “make” any of the statements in the Janus Investment Fund prospectus.‟ The court supports its conclusion with the analogy to the relationship of speechwriter and a speaker where the court concludes that “[e]ven when a speechwriter drafts a speech, the content is entirely within the control of the person who delivers it.  And, it is the speaker who takes credit – or blame – for what is ultimately said.” However, the analogy fails.  </p>
<p>When a speech is delivered it is delivered by a human being; a corporation is not such a being and can only act through individuals and then can act only through the symbiosis of the entity structure or structures by which the entity operates.”  </p>
<p>People who look at Janus will be reminded of the same Court’s Citizens United ruling. In both radical decisions, the Justices subverted human civil justice by granting business enterprises the rights of human beings.   <br />“Protestors Give Obama and Congressional Dems Second Chance”    <br />Be that as it may, the above list of demands is only a start.  President Obama, once a community organizer himself, could still wear FDR’s mantle.   As Paul Krugman says:    <br />“Democrats are being given what amounts to a second chance. The Obama administration squandered a lot of potential good will early on by adopting banker-friendly policies that failed to deliver economic recovery even as bankers repaid the favor by turning on the president. Now, however, Mr. Obama’s party has a chance for a do-over. All it has to do is take these protests as seriously as they deserve to be taken.&#8221;    <br />No doubt, those camping in the park near Wall Street and in the shadow of Trinity Church would agree that, as a start, the federal government should enforce existing laws against defrauding the public, and restore to citizens the legal rights to hold accountable those who did and do defraud them.  That part is simple.   <br />The hard part is actually delivering the Rooseveltian change candidate Obama dangled before us at the third battle of Manassas.  And that battle has not yet been won, although he was elected President the next day.</p>
<p>Civil War history buffs know that the Confederate States of America won the first and second battles of Manassas. Hopefully, the citizens of the United States of America will win the third one with the help of the Wall Street protestors and President Obama.</p>

<li>Private Investment peaks in 2006. Dating the start of the <s>current</s> recession from December of 2007 still strikes me as being six months late.

<li>Consumption goes up fairly steadily from 1981, encompassing 8% more of total GDP—around a 12% increase over less than thirty years.  Coincidentally, the Reagan Revolution moves taxes more heavily onto consumers at the same time.  (Note that only about half of the appreciation in consumption is reflected in the change in Net Exports.)

<p><strong>Expect Neither ‘Sustainable’ nor ‘Comprehensive’ From Euro Area Leaders</strong></p>
<p>﻿﻿On Sunday, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,790954,00.html">Merkel and Sarkozy </a>promised a “sustainable and comprehensive” solution to the euro debt crisis ahead of the November 3-4 G20 meeting. Along with this rather grand announcement are absolutely no details on their plan. However, <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/125014.pdf">Van Rompuy </a>today pushed back the European Summit, which convenes now on October 23, to ‘finalise our comprehensive strategy on the Euro area sovereign debt criris’. Perhaps a real plan is in the works. I think not.</p>
<p>In the back of my mind, I have 5 necessary conditions that must be satisfied in order to achieve a ‘comprehensive and sustainable’ policy response to the Euro area debt crisis. None of these conditions will be satisfied in full, critical conditions not even partially (namely 3. and 4. below). I can only conclude that any response/strategy negotiated at the October Summit will be neither ‘comprehensive’ nor ‘sustainable’.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The 5 elements of a resolution to the European debt crisis:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Element 1.</em> There’s too much debt, and it must be written down. Banks are exposed to insolvent governments and defaults from a decade of leverage built in the private sector (Spain, Ireland, and Portugal). Europe is at just the initial stages of this process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expectation for October 23rd: <strong>Partial response</strong>. This may be partially addressed if they include significant haircuts to Greece’s debt as part of the bank recapitalization effort. However, there are no details as to how the bank recapitalization efforts will transpire (except for the elusive word ‘comprehensive’). And if they address Greece restructuring only, then we’ll likely be here again in coming quarters – Europe is a <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/2011/09/13/the-european-debt-crisis-in-charts/">few years behind the US</a> in their deleveraging cycle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, unless the bank recapitalization effort is done by some pan-euro body and ALL banks are forced to take capital jointly (not unlike TARP), I view any lesser, nationalistic effort, as a net-negative for medium-term market sentiment. Another positive response, in my view, would be a joint guarantee of bank deposits, which would require coordination at the supranational level. Full coordination would be welcome but is unlikely.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Element 2</em>. Near-term liquidity needs to be provided to those sovereigns/banks that are solvent but face funding pressures. The ECB has addressed the funding pressure for the near term and is likely to continue to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expectation for October 23rd: <strong>Partial response</strong>. This is only a partial response because the ECB has already sufficiently addressed <a href="http://www.ecb.int/press/pr/date/2011/html/pr111006_4.en.html">fixed term liquidity </a>operations. Currently, European banks hold about €200 billion <a href="http://www.ecb.int/mopo/liq/html/index.en.html">in excess reserves </a>(7-day average), up from roughly €25 billion spanning the bulk of 2011, and unlimited FX funding is available <a href="http://www.ecb.int/press/pr/date/2011/html/pr110915.en.html">through March of 2012</a>. The ECB continues to purchase Italian and Spanish bonds on the secondary market through its SMP in support of two arguably solvent sovereigns.</p>
<p>Notably, though, there’s still a large hole in the capacity of the EFSF to do it all: recapitalize the banking systems, provide emergency lending to national governments, and backstop Spain and Italy. Addressing the insufficiencies of the EFSF, either as a structure and/or a policy response-tool (or the permanent ESM counterpart), <strong>would entail a full response. However, I expect nothing to be announced regarding </strong>the capacity of the EFSF to address all efforts. An announcement that does alleviate the capacity problem of the EFSF would be a net-positive.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Element 3</em>. A move toward more fiscal interconnectedness should be more decisively established, including a fiscal ‘lender of last resort’. This function may be performed by ECB, but presumably a fiscal institution should act in this role.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expectation for October 23rd: <strong>No response</strong>. In fact, this is the part of the ‘comprehensive solution’ that will likely require an acute worsening of economic and financial conditions (interrelated).’</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Element 4</em>. Switch to 1st gear in the drive for fiscal austerity and competitiveness. True, some countries could benefit greatly from reform, which buffets long-term growth potential. However, fiscal and institutional reform to increase competitiveness takes years to pass through to potential growth, and the timeline needs to be extended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expectation for October 23rd: <strong>No response</strong>. This is the most challenging piece of a comprehensive solution. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3ba2f7c4-ee76-11e0-a2ed-00144feab49a.html&#038;sa=U&#038;ei=PB-TTvWZNuL50gHyyZFU&#038;ved=0CBEQFjAA&#038;usg=AFQjCNE7s7-jdcUo4k8rHwTwyg87raB5MA">Martin Wolf calls it</a> fostering a ‘credible adjustment’ of the flows (i.e., macroeconomic imbalances). Under a credible Euro-area adjustment plan, reform from ALL parties involved, rather than just by the weaker nations, must be implemented. Until Germany and the core ‘exporters’ (all of the core countries except for France run current account surpluses) institute reform alongside the weaker debtor countries, adjustment has no hope.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Element 5</em>. Macroprudential policies and new infrastructure needs to be erected in order to address and enforce macroeconomic Treaty rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expectation for October 23rd: <strong>Wildcard, but probably nothing substantial</strong>. This would require (probably) amendments to EU Treaties and/or mandates for current institutions (like the EBA or the ECB).</p>
<p>In conclusion, markets may be making a mountain out of what is likely to be a molehill response to the current crisis, one that’s neither ‘comprehensive’ nor ‘sustainable’. If, however, we do get some response by way of required actions 3 or 4, that would be a great leap forward for the sustainability of the Euro area.</p>

<p>In a recent posting, I commented further on the lack of arguments supporting the corporatist lobbying drive for another &#8220;repatriation tax holiday&#8221; for multinational corporations that have stashed more than a trillion abroad (often through gimmicky transfers of intangible property such as rights to patents developed in the United States).  See  <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/10/repatriation-holiday-lobbying-money-speaks.html">Repatriation Holiday Lobbying&#8211;Money Speaks </a>(Oct. 3, 2011).</p>
<p>The reasons are manifold.  Corporations today are not cash-strapped&#8211;they&#8217;ve got lots of cash in the US too.   And even if they need cash that is currently offshore, they can borrow against that cash at exceptionally low rates today. So they aren&#8217;t investing in expansion that would create new jobs for lack of cash&#8211;they are not investing in expansion for lack of customers.  The middle class is collapsing, after four decades of reaganomics have steadily worked to erode unions and the empowerment they offer workers, leaving worker wages in decline while their bosses roll into the ranks of the superrich on their newfound ability to take an undue share of the companies&#8217; productivity gains.  Even when money is actually brought back (rather than already resting in US bank accounts), it is most likely to be used to pay even higher performance bonuses to top managers and to pay for dividends and share buybacks for shareholders.  And those shareholders are most likely merely to use it to make new secondary market share purchases&#8211;resulting merely in a net change in their portfolios&#8211;not direct funding of new enterprises.  Much of those secondary market investments are likely to be in emerging markets rather than in the United States. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Most telling is that the very fact of one tax holiday means that corporations will inevitably plan for and conduct business assuming future tax holidays.  It is ikely that planning for this current lobbying effort began on the day Congress passed the 2004 Jobs Act!  What that means is that <strong>the tax holiday itself encourages even more of the very offshoring activity it claims to be amerliorating.  C</strong>orporations will use gimmicks to move and stash away even more money offshore to avoid even more current taxes, in the hopes that there will be a further tax holiday that will allow almost zero taxation on those repatriated profits.  That certainly happened after 2004&#8211;the companies that had been good citizens and had regularly repatriated cash found themselves losers compared to the bad citizens that had used offshoring to avoid taxation.  More of the good citizens then became bad citizens, and the amount of offshore cash has grown much faster since the 2004 repatriation holiday than before.</p>
<p>And our experience with repatriation tax holidays was a telling one.  Corporate lobbyists worked hard to get the misnamed 2004 &#8220;American Jobs Act&#8221; passed with a very low tax rate for repatriated funds.  Yet it resulted in very little job creation. </p>
<p>(This is not surprising, since (i) corporate tax cuts don&#8217;t create jobs; consumer demand does and (ii) Congress didn&#8217;t put any real teeth in the job creation end of the legislation, such as demanding that any corporation repatriating cash and expecting the low rate establish that it had created substantial new jobs with the repatriated funds that were not on the planning board at the time repatriation was first introduced or when it was passed and that those jobs were permanent full-time domestic jobs.) </p>
<p>In fact, a new study by the Institute of Policy Studies addresses what it calls the &#8220;dangerous myth&#8221; that &#8220;corporate tax cuts create jobs&#8221; and the &#8220;disastrous results&#8221; of the 2004 tax holiday.  It reminds us that a government report found that 12 of the top repatriators brought home $100 billion (a third of the total repatriated under the earlier provision) and yet laid off 67,000 workers in the two years after the windfall.  Further, the 2004 holiday allowed 843 companies to use $312 billion in repatriated funds while avoiding $92 billion in taxes.  The worse factoid of all is the one that shows that U.S. taxpayers  &#8220;provided a huge subsidy to corporations that destroyed jobs&#8221;:  <em>58 corporations that accounted for about 70% of the repatriated funds  <strong>cut almost</strong> 600,000 jobs</em>.  Report at 6-7.  See <a href="http://www.ips-dc.org/reports/corporations_that_take_tax_holidays_slash_jobs">America Loses: Corporations that Take &#8216;Tax Holidays&#8217; Slash Jobs</a>, Institute for Policy Studies (Oct. 3, 2011) (summary, with link to full report). </p>
<p>The report is clear in its description of the way US corporations shift profits overseas and then lobby for even lower taxes.</p>
<p>Drug companies — and many other companies as well, especially in the technology sector — don’t just <em><em><em>make </em></em></em>profits overseas. They <em><em>shift  </em></em>profits overseas. The process has become lucratively routine. One example:  A U.S.-based corporation begins the process by having a foreign subsidiary register its patents in countries like Luxembourg that do not tax income from intellectual property. The subsidiary then charges its U.S counterpart a high price for use of the patents. These high royalty fees, coupled with the costs of research, marketing, and management, allow the U.S. operation to report to the IRS an artificially small profit — or even no profit at all. With no appreciable profit to report, the U.S. operation has no appreciable corporate income tax to pay. The company’s actual profits sit undisturbed with the overseas subsidiary.  Report at 11.</p>
<p>The report also scorns the lobbying efforts of <a href="http://www.winamericacampaign.org/">WIN America</a>, which has spent more than $50 million lobbying for the tax break, which would cost the fisc around $80 billion in lost revenues.  Report at 9-11.   WIN America&#8211;a coalition of 18 publicly traded corporations and 24 trade associations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce&#8211;has &#8220;hired 42 former congressional staffers who worked for the House Ways and Means Commitee or the Senate Finance Commmittee&#8221;.  Report at 9.  It goes on to rep9ort on the way individual members of the coalition have lobbied for the tax break (e.g., Pfizer&#8217;s sponsoring a favorable section on 60 Minutes) and cut jobs (e.g., Duke Energy&#8217;s cutting 10,000 jobs, probably as a result of its 2006 merger with Cinergy in the U.S., contributing to the North Carolina Democratic Party and then, shortly after getting support for repatriation from the Democratic governor of North Carolina and its Democratic Senator Kay Hagan).</p>
<p>For other commentary, see also John Carney, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/44773176">Corporate Tax Holidays Might Not Create Jobs</a>, CNBC (Oct 4, 2011) (commenting on the IPS report as well as the Heritage Foundation report discussed below).</p>
<p>The WIN America coalition was undoubtedly taken by surprise when the right-leaning Heritage Foundation came out with its own report, a &#8220;backgrounder&#8221; on taxes that condemns the repatriation tax holiday idea as not doing much to create jobs: J.D. Foster &#038; Curtis Dubay, <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2011/10/Would-Another-Repatriation-Tax-Holiday-Create-Jobs">Would Another Repatriation Tax Holiday Create Jobs? </a>(Oct. 4, 2011).    The Heritage Foundation report acknowledges that &#8220;<em>if another repatriation tax holiday were enacted, one should expect a similar result as last time: specifically, a surge in repatriations and little appreciable increase in domestic investment or job creation.&#8221;  </em>And it cites the reasons one would expect&#8211;today&#8217;s multinationals that have money to repatriate are not cash-strapped:  any investments that they need to make for business expansion purposes (that would create new jobs) they can do readily without needing a repatriation tax holiday to grease the skids.</p>
<p>By the way, the Heritage Foundation is resisting repatriation because it wants the big prize&#8211;an overall cut in the corporate tax rate and a shift from our current system of taxing worldwide income (after tax credits for taxes paid elsewhere) to a territorial system&#8211;and it doesn&#8217;t think repatriation will be treated as a step in that direction.  Those Heritage-supported tax policies would result in even more offshoring and even less corporate tax contribution to the fisc, which is already terribly low at around 2-3% of GDP.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the WIN America coalition struck back today, with a press release attacking its ordinary ally for not supporting the repatriation tax holiday drive: <a href="http://www.winamericacampaign.org/2011/10/04/fact-check-heritage%E2%80%99s-flawed-study-ignores-previous-support-repatriation/">Fact Check: Heritage&#8217;s Flawed Study Ignores Their Previous Support for Repatriation</a> (Oct. 4, 2011).  The coalition has three arguments: (1) Heritage said something different back in December 2010, (2) other studies say repatriation will create millions of jobs, (3) the 2004 Jobs Act really did work in spite of what these other studies claim because the firms themselves say they created jobs, and (4) lots of people support repatriation.  None of these arguments hold water.</p>
<p>The coalition first complains that a December 2010 Heritage study concluded that repatriation would &#8220;provide additional liquidity&#8221; that would increase shareholder wealth allowing them to make &#8220;new investments&#8221; and would permit the firms to finance current operations, reducing their need to borrow working capital.  Let&#8217;s parse this out.  The  primary reason that doesn&#8217;t make sense today (if it ever did, which is dubious) is, as the Heritage Foundation&#8217;s current report points out, that US firms are not cash strapped.  They don&#8217;t need more liquidity to be able to make investments or finance their current operations.  They probably don&#8217;t even want to reduce loans that are at historically low interest rates any more than they are doing.  And shareholders&#8217; &#8220;new investments&#8221;, as noted above, are just a move from one portfolio investment to another&#8211;they are not investments that encourage entrepreneurs or go to the working capital of companies but just a result of secondary market purchases.  Very little of that does much for the US economy or anything for creating new U.S. jobs.</p>
<p>WIN America counters that the August 2011 study done for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, <a href="http://www.winamericacampaign.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/The-Need-for-Pro-Growth-Corporate-Tax-Reform.pdf">The Need for Pro-Growth Corporate Tax Reform</a>, claims that a repatriation tax holiday will &#8220;speed the pace of economic recovery, increasing GDP by roughly $360 billion and creating approximately 2.9 million jobs&#8221; because repatriation tax holidays are &#8220;a private-sector approach to stimulus.&#8221;  That&#8217;s quite simply balderdash.  These same kinds of pie-in-the-sky claims were made about the disastrous 2004 repatriation tax holiday, and they were proven wrong then.  They are based on the same bad economics now, the economics that says that &#8220;the high U.S. [corporate tax] rate harms economic growth, the amount and quality of U.S. investment, and the wages of U.S. workers.&#8221;  That claim is simply unsupported&#8211;the U.S. is a tax haven, a reasonable amount of taxes will never discourage a business from expanding its business when it thinks that expansion is going to be profitable and it has the money to do it.  It is in fact this same school of economic thought that has given us the Laffer curve, the &#8220;rational man&#8221; calculations, and the rest of the Hocus-Pocus economics enterprise that treats rigidly unrealistic assumptions as God&#8217;s Truth to justify an ever-increasing share of corporate profits going to managers rather than workers. </p>
<p>WIN America then argues that 23% of the 2004 repatriated funds went to job creation and should be considered a great benefit to the economy.  That number is derived from a survey of tax executives&#8211;essentially self reporting on the result of the company-favorable tax repatriation holiday, so it is not only a very low return on the high tax cost of the repatriation tax holiday, but also one that must be evaluated with some acknowledgement of the fungibility of money and the ability of firms to claim that job creation and investment that they would have done anyway was done &#8220;because of&#8221; the repatriated funds.</p>
<p>WIN America concludes with quotes from lots of people (probably written by WIN America or one of its army of lobbyists, don&#8217;t ya think?).  These quotes just repeat the desired sound bites &#8212; &#8220;bringing the money home&#8221; will &#8220;create jobs and re-invest in America&#8221; (GOP representative Gregory Meeks, Sept. 9, 2011); &#8220;let&#8217;s bring those dollars back&#8221;&#8230; and &#8220;companies outght to put it into workforce training or they ought to put it into research and development&#8221; (GOP Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Sept. 14, 2011).  And so on.</p>
