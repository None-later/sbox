<p>  House passes spending bill    </p>
<p>While the Senate was wrangling over what of the noxious provisions in HR 3630 they would have to keep in order to get expanded unemployment compensation and a payroll tax cut, the House passed a spending bill 296-121 (with 147 Republicans and 149 Democrats in favor) to carry the government through September 2012.  Steinhauer &#038; Pear, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/us/politics/boehner-ties-oil-pipeline-to-payroll-tax-bill.html">Senate Leaders Agree to a Two Month Extension of the Payroll Tax Cut</a>, New York Times (Dec. 16, 2011).</p>
<p>The GOP strategy is to obstruct and demand&#8211;one right-wing idea after another is inserted into every bill, just so the Dems will think they have won something when they give the Republicans ten things instead of 100!<br />
<blockquote>As wrangling over the tax has continued, Republican leaders have sought to build support for the measure by adding conservative policy provisions, which have replaced earmarks as the legislative sweetener for Republican lawmakers in a Congress where fundamental differences about the role of government in American life deeply divide the parties.<br />That conflict, which mirrors the broader political dynamic across the country, is unlikely to ebb in the second session, as Republicans labor to make life more difficult for President Obama and Democrats struggle to hold the White House and the Senate.  Id.</p></blockquote>

<p>The spending bill isn&#8217;t much better.  See Sonmez, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/government-funding-bill-that-will-avert-shutdown-passed-by-house/2011/12/16/gIQAq2ggyO_blog.html">Government Funding Bill That Will Avert Shutdown Passed by House</a>, Washington Post Blog, Dec. 16, 2011; Steinhauer &#038; Pear, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/us/politics/boehner-ties-oil-pipeline-to-payroll-tax-bill.html">Senate Leaders Agree to a Two Month Extension of the Payroll Tax Cut</a>, New York Times (Dec. 16, 2011). Defense gets $518 billion and military gets a 1.6% pay raise.  (Remember that this same house in HR 3630, the unemployment extension bill, wanted to freeze all federal workers&#8217; pay for another year, and require greater retirement contributions, among other stingy things for ordinary people.) </p>
<p>In line with the GOP&#8217;s anti-regulations ploy, the House bill makes it harder for the government to regulate marketing for food targeted at kids&#8211;now there has to be a cost-benefit analysis.  Regretably, cost-benefit analysis is one of those &#8220;economics&#8221;-based policy ideas that essentially favors the retention of the status quo: any regulation will cost businesses something (restrained marketing to kids costs junk food businesses a whole sector of potential targets, er, customers), and the business world portrays the benefit of healthy food or less exploited kids as miniscule compared to the wonders of their profits and what that can do for society (the wealthy will get wealthier, no doubt).</p>
<p>The House doesn&#8217;t care much for ordinary people.  Low-income heating assistance spending will be cut compared to last year and the National Institutes for Health will be barely increased.  The GOP is placing its moral oprobrium of gays in the limelight by prohibiting health money from being used in needle exchange programs, which have been shown to be effective in curbing the spread of AIDS.  Obama&#8217;s education initiative is cut 20%&#8211;in spite of the fact that education is key to economic growth and the development of human capital.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In this <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/competition-hasnt-worked-in-health-care/2011/08/25/gIQAyvXPyO_blog.html#pagebreak">must read post</a> Ezra Klein asked Ron Wyden and Paul Ryan for evidence that forcing the CMS (Medicare/Medicade) to compete more with private insurers  can be used to reduce health care spending.  The logic must be that the private sector is better able to control costs so private insurers can insure for less, and, if they must compete, will do so.  </p>
<p>They answered* pointing to competition in the Federal Employee Benefits Program.  Klein counters noting that costs have risen as fast for the FEBP as for employee health insurance plan which don&#8217;t ask employees to chose between competing offers.  Note those other plans, the ones without competition, are mainly used by private profit maximizing firms.  </p>
<p>To support their claim that private firms are better at controlling costs than the Federal Government, they pointed to a Federal Government program, and just assumed that it is more efficient than the approach taken by profit maximizing firms.  So the proof that the private sector can do it better than the Federal Government is based on the assumption that the Federal Government must be doing it better than the private sector.</p>
<p>It pained me to type Wyden in the title, because I think he is responsible for the best contribution to the national policy debate since Martin Luther King had a dream</p>
<p>OK so he really sincerely hates employer provided health insurance, but the evidence does not support him, and the guy licking the cake was under 65 and not stuck with Medicare.  Also what Albert Einstein said about Medicare Advantage and Ryan-Wyden (and Ryan-Rivlin &#8212; who has ever fit his definition of craziness better than Ron Wyden ?).</p>

<p>I am only posting this, because I have been very remiss about posting this semester (I&#8217;ve actually been teaching).</p>
<p>* Yes I am envious as all hell that someone half my age can get an answer out of a Senator and the chairman of a major House committee.  Given how much work each of us has done on the topic I conclude that life is just soooo uh  fair.  I hate that.</p>
<p>update:  OK so I tend to get stuck on youtube.  But you really really have to watch this arabic language McDonalds ad.  To understand Arabic views of US capitalism, gender relations, Big Macs and Meat Loaf, &#8230; oh hell just watch</p>
<p>update 2:  The second video is relevant.  Part (estimated at one seventh of the extra cost or 2% of total costs) of the reason that Medicare advantage csts more than ordinary CMS Medicare is that the plans do offer advantages to subscribers.  They have to do this, because participation in Medicare Advantage is voluntary and Medicare Advantage is competing with Medicare which has the strongest brand in the USA &#8212; much stronger than McDonalds or Coca Cola or iWhatever.</p>

<p>EA Infernal Devaluation Progressing</p>
<p>The EU answer to rebalancing portfolio and trade flows within the Euro area (EA) without currency devaluation is recession and deflation. They call this ‘internal devaluation’ – shifting relative prices by reducing domestic demand in the debtor countries, thereby shifting the terms of trade. Marshall Auerback calls it ‘<em>infernal</em>devaluation’. Marshall’s right.</p>
<p>Today we got more evidence that infernal devaluation is progressing. <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-16122011-AP/EN/3-16122011-AP-EN.PDF">EA unit labor costs </a>(ULC) – average cost of labour per hour workers – increased 0.2% in the third quarter, slowing the annual pace from 3.1% to 2.7%. While the slowdown was to be expected, given the deterioration of domestic demand, the elevated level of growth in ULC suggests that wages in Europe are stickier than what is needed to effectively drive the terms of trade via internal devaluation. Better put: downward pressure in European wages moves more like molasses than water; it will take severe recessions in some of the debtor countries to drive relative prices down sufficient enough to feasibly shift the terms of trade.</p>
<p>The table below lists the average annual ULC gains/losses relative to the EA overall. Germany’s moving on par with the EA, averaging -0.05% (rounded to 0 in the Table) annual relative ULC growth. Germany should be seeing relative appreciation. Spain and Italy are seeing average annual relative depreciation, -0.6% and -0.3%, respectively, per quarter. This is consistent with what is ‘supposed to happen’ in Italy and Spain to shift relative capital and trade flows. However, Netherlands and Finland are matching pace, big exporters that theoretically <em>should</em> be turning importers. France is seeing relative appreciation, +2.2% average annual relative ULC gains; but they were already running CA deficits. Austria and Belgium experienced relative annual price gains, +0.65% and 0.99%, respectively; but they’re too small to matter. Greece and Ireland (Greek data is truncated at Q2 2011) successfully devalued. But at what cost? Their unemployment rates that are now multiples of what they were before the crisis.</p>

<p>As a point of reference, the average annual depreciation of US ULC relative to that of the EA is -2.1%. Not only are EA countries losing competitiveness to key developed players, the US for example, but they’re fighting a battle to the bottom within the EA. This is a lose-lose situation.<br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2011/12/ULC_table1.jpg"><img alt="" height="163" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2011/12/ULC_table1.jpg" width="982"></a><br />I hear through unnamed sources that Sarkozy and Merkel are planning (another) Summit next month – I cannot validate this through really anything except word of mouth. They’re meeting to discuss the impact of the contractionary austerity policies on EA economic growth. Duh.<br />The denial regarding the <em>infernal </em>impact of their deflationary policy is truly remarkable.</p>

<p>Payroll Tax Cut -Keystone vote up Saturday at 9 in Senate</p>
<p>Apparently, Senate leaders on Friday ironed out the difficulty between the GOP and the Democratic party.  The GOP got most everything it wanted, and the Dems got just barely more than nothing.  That&#8217;s the way &#8220;negotiating&#8221; seems to go in the Congress these days.  The right demands and demands and demands and gets most of it by obfuscating and obstructing. </p>
<p>This time the Dems were worried about not getting a spending bill.  So while the House passed a spending bill to carry the Federal Government through September 2012, the Senate caved on all the things they&#8217;d said they wouldn&#8217;t cave on&#8211;like the ridiculous provision for expedited approval of the Keystone Pipeline.  All to get just a 2-month extension of the payroll tax cut and expanded unemployment benefits&#8211;which the GOP knew it could not afford not to pass, no matter what.  And Obama has already flipped on his earlier looks-like-he&#8217;s-finally-figured-out-how-to-stand-tall position that he would veto any bill that carried the expedited Keystone approval provision.  See Steinhaur &#038; Pear, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/us/politics/boehner-ties-oil-pipeline-to-payroll-tax-bill.html">Senate Agrees to a Two-Month Extension of the Tax Cut</a>, New York Times (Dec. 16, 2011). <br /><a name="more"></a>The GOP continues to call the Keystone pipeline project a &#8220;job creator&#8221;, even though it will create no more than 50 permanent jobs, at a considerable environmental cost.  Schumer calls the Keystone provision a &#8220;Pyrrhic victory&#8221; for the GOP, because he says Obama will not approve it if pushed.  That&#8217;s not so clear to me.  Schumer also spins the cave-in as a victory for Dems! saying that the GOP won&#8217;t have the leverage of the need to pass a spending bill when this issue comes back.  See  Rubin et al, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-16/u-s-senate-leaders-agree-on-two-month-payroll-tax-cut-extension.html">U.S. Senate Leaders Agree on Two-Month Payroll Cut </a>, Bloomberg.com (Dec. 16, 2011). <br />Again, past experience suggests this may be too rosy an assessment.  There were commentators who thought that surely the Congress would not pass further tax cuts after the 2001 tax cuts resulted in large deficits but instead we got the 2003 bill and the 2004 tax giveaway for corporations bill and many others, with the deficits mounting with each one.  One would have thought that the sunset of the various Bush tax cuts in 2010 would have been a perfect time for the Dems to develop a spine, but they didn&#8217;t.  And the Dems weren&#8217;t even able to pass a bill ending the carried interest subsidy for hedge fund managers, in spite of the Great Recession and the need to reign in financial institutions.<br />The Senate bill will apparently at least not include some of the bad stuff  that was in HR 3630 as passed by the House&#8211;it is &#8220;scaled back&#8221; so it looks like medicare premiums won&#8217;t rise for seniors, and  the GOP won&#8217;t win its attempt to end medicare&#8217;s coverage of outpatient rehabilitative therapy for stroke victims and medicare payments to doctors will not be affected.   Nor will it include the &#8220;extensions&#8221; of expiring tax provisions like the R&#038;D credit or the active financing exception for the financial  industries&#8217; deferral of its offshoreprofits.  Id.<br />The Senate bill will apparently be paid for by raising the guarantee fees for Freddie and Fannie, something that was included in HR 3630.  Id.  Vote is to take place at 9 am Saturday.<br />crossposted at <a href="http://www.blogger.com/Payroll%20Tax%20Cut%20-Keystone%20vote%20up%20Saturday%20at%209%20in%20Senate" target="_blank">ataxingmatter</a></p>

<p>Social Security&#8230;Hearts and Minds</p>
<p>   Tom Margenau wrote an essay about the payroll tax holiday in The National Memo <a href="http://nationalmemo.com/content/your-tax-holiday-gift-lump-coal" target="_blank">Is Your Tax Holiday Gift A Lump of Coal?</a>  His essay seemed to me to illustrate one of the problems with the Social Security &#8220;debate&#8221; as it has been constructed.</p>
<p>Margenau  describes himself as &#8220;not very good with numbers,&#8221; but someone who has been accused of being &#8220;a bleeding heart liberal.&#8221;  &#8220;But,&#8221; he says, &#8220;this is one liberal who gives the Republicans credit&#8230; at least they are willing to talk about it.&#8221;   The trouble with all this is that Margenau does not understand the numbers, so he is giving the Republicans credit for being willing to talk about a problem that does not exist.</p>
<p>This is exactly what &#8220;liberals&#8221; have been doing:  searching, searching for a way to ease their bleeding hearts by solving the huge, terrible problem that only looks huge when you don&#8217;t understand the numbers.</p>
<p>Margenau cites the famous &#8220;in less than 20 years there will be only two workers supporting each retiree.&#8221; And he proposes &#8220;relatively modest changes&#8230; bumping up the retirement age..&#8221;</p>
<p>You may read his full essay at the place cited.  Easiest for me to simply reprint here the reply I sent to him. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Tom,  Your heart is in the right place, but you miss the critical point.  Social Security is not welfare.  It is critically important that it   is not welfare.  FDR understood this so he made it &#8220;worker paid&#8221;   insurance, &#8220;so no damn pollitician can take it away from them.&#8221;  Social Security was never in trouble. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> All that 3 to 1 and 2 to 1   worker to retiree ratio is lying nonsense meant to impose on people   whose math skills are not very good.  What it amounts to is that if people are going to live longer&#8230;  say   20 years after working 40 years, instead of 13 years after   working 40 years, they will need to save about one third more each   month for their own retirement.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> This means raising the payroll tax   from 6% to about 8%.  And since the change in life expectancy is not   going to happen all at once, it means we can raise the payroll tax   one half of one tenth of one percent each year. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> This is an increase of 40 cents per week for the average worker   today.  And while the increase gets bigger over time, so do wages. So   the increase will never be felt as more of a burden than that 40   cents per week.  AND the workers will get the money back, with   interest, so they can look forward to a longer retirement with better   benefits than today&#8217;s retirees. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> The Republicans were not being more responsible&#8230; they were telling   a Big Lie.  They could get away with it because the average person is   innumerate, and the average liberal no longer understands the   important difference between Social Security and welfare.  It is probably too late, but it would help if the people who think SS   is important at least understood the facts and the basic principle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Margenau replied to me that &#8220;the worker to beneficiary ratio is not lying nonsense.  It is critically important.&#8221;  And indeed it is.  It is fundamental.  But it doesn&#8217;t mean what he thinks it means.  All it means is that if we are going to live longer we are going to have to save more for our retirement. The &#8220;more&#8221; is not burdensome.</p>
<p>But working an extra year could be hell for many people.   Meanwhile, Our President, and his Friends Across the Aisle have killed Social Security.  They did it by the breathtakingly bold and easy step of just taking away its funding by calling for a &#8220;payroll tax holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Democrats &#8230;Democrats!&#8230; are now running on the issue of making the payroll tax holiday permanent &#8220;to avoid a huge tax increase on the middle class.&#8221;  The lying is sickening.  But the people will go for it.  And the Republicans will cry,  &#8220;Oh no, not the briar patch!  Don&#8217;t throw me in dat briar patch Br&#8217;er Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>And laugh up their sleeves while the &#8220;progressives&#8221; think they have scored a huge win for the poor.   And the poor will never understand what happened until they go to retire and learn they&#8217;ve had another year added on to their sentence, or have to go to the welfare office to prove they need &#8220;benefits,&#8221;  and they better bring a note from their doctor saying they only have one more year to live.</p>
<p>The only way out of this would be a sudden demand by a hundred million working people to &#8220;raise our taxes!  give us back our Social Security!&#8221;</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                            <a href="./../../../category/steve-roth/index.html" class="post-category-41" title="Steve Roth"><div class="color-box"></div>Steve Roth</a>                                                                     </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Let&#8217;s start with two basic facts:</p>
<div>• Governments in all thriving, prosperous countries tax/spend 25–50% of those countries&#8217; GDP (averaging around 40%).</div>
<div></div>
<div>• Governments in non-prosperous countries &#8212; those that haven&#8217;t suffered a recent crash in the numerator/GDP &#8212; are all below that range.</div>
<div></div>
<p>There is not a single thriving, prosperous country that does not tax at these levels, or engage in massive quantities of redistribution. Not one.</p>
<p>For me, this raises the conundrum:</p>
<div>If policies eschewing such redistribution are so economically efficient &#8212; as claimed by libertarians/conservatives/Republicans/neoclassical economists &#8212; one would expect at least one country to have emerged that eschews those policies, and to see that country surge ahead of all the rest.</div>
<div></div>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t happened. Not once.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s easy to jump to the <em>post hoc ergo propter hoc </em>conclusion:</p>
<div>Redistribution is necessary for a prosperous country to emerge and thrive. It is at least a necessary (though of course not necessarily sufficient) <em>cause</em> of that prosperity.</div>
<div></div>
<p>But of course you can argue the opposite causation:</p>
<div>Prosperity causes bigger government.</div>
<div></div>
<p>I see two possibilities there:<br /><a name="more"></a>
<div></div>
<div>1. Government services are &#8220;normal goods&#8221; &#8212; as people get more prosperous, they want more of them. Giving people what they want is not a bad thing.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2. The growth of government is an emergent property of a prosperous economy, and is not actually an expression of, does not provide, what individuals want. It just happens because of the inherent dynamics of the system. (Dynamics that are easy to imagine but that I won&#8217;t describe here.)</div>
<p>#2 is, I think, the the argument that libertarians would make to explain the correlation between government size and prosperity.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to adjudicate in any definitive way between these two conclusions, or between [one of them] and the redistribution-&#8220;causes&#8221;-prosperity conclusion.</p>
<p>Given some correlation (necessary to even assert causation), the only way to convincingly demonstrate causation is to tell a coherent and convincing story about the process by which the causation happens. That&#8217;s what I did in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/12/nine-reasons-that-progressive-policies.html">my first Angry Bear post</a> (well, you can judge for yourself how convincing it is).</p>
<p>Absent any definitive way to decide, for the time being I&#8217;m going to stick with the first-blush conclusion suggested by the correlation, and supported by my theories of causation:</p>
<div>Larger government and a significant dose of redistribution are necessary for a prosperous, modern country to emerge and thrive.</div>

<p>Foreign-owned US insurance companies frequently reinsure through their foreign affiliates and then claim a deduction under section 832(b)(4)(A) for the reinsurance premium paid to the affiliate to reduce the US tax liability of the US company.</p>
<p>Rep. Richard Neal (D-Ma) introduced a bill on October 12 that has been referred to the House Ways &#038; Means Committee, where it now languishes unattended by the Republican chair, David Camp of Michigan.  <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3157:">H.R. 3157</a> amends the Internal Revenue Code to create a new section 849, which disallows the deduction for certain reinsurance premiums and related amounts paid to non-taxed foreign affiliates, defined as members of a controlled group, with 50% rather than the usual 80% used to define a control relationship. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The President&#8217;s FY 2012 Budget included a similar proposal for disallowing some affiliated reinsurance premium amounts.  Earlier iterations of a disallowance bill were introduced in 2000 and 2001.  A bill with somewhat broader disallowance provisions, H.R. 3424, was introduced by Representative Neal in 2010 and did receive a hearing at Ways &#038; Means that year.  <!-- more --> The Joint Committee on Taxation issued a report on reinsurance with offshore affiliates prior to the hearings on H.R. 3424 in 2010, titled &#8220;Present Law And Analysis Relating To The Tax Treatment Of Reinsurance Transactions Between Affiliated Entities&#8221;, <a href="http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&#038;id=3690">JCX-35-10</a> (including a description of HR 3424 and the President&#8217;s FY 2012 proposal, beginning at page 22).  As noted in the JCT report:</p>
<blockquote><p>When these assets are shifted from a U.S. insurer to an offshore reinsurer with a foreign parent, these earnings may no longer be subject to U.S. income taxation. If the U.S. insurer and the offshore reinsurer are affiliated, the profits attributable to the reinsured risks remain within the affiliated group, although the earnings on the assets may no longer be subject to U.S.income taxation. (footnotes deleted)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the offshore affiliate is in a low or no-tax jurisdiction, the result may be almost no tax  on the reinsurance premium amounts (other than the applicable excise tax, if not eliminated by treaty).  Not surprisingly, the trend over the last few decades has been towards reinsurance arrangements with affiliates:  between 2001 and 2008, ceding of insurance of offshore affiliates grew by more than 108%, while ceding of insurance to nonaffiliated offshore entities grew by only 16%.  See JCT report at 11, n.21 and accompanying text.  Bermuda, a jurisdiction with no corporate tax and one especially friendly to insurers, is the most frequent jurisdiction for these affiliated reinsurance transactions.  The JCT report notes that the lack of a market price for affiliate transactions provides an incentive to shift income between affiliates at off-market prices.</p>
<p>Also not surprisingly, lobbyists for these foreign-owned insurance companies have fiercely fought the possibility that this handy tax-reduction technique might be legislated away.  The &#8220;Coalition for Competitive Insurance Rates&#8221; put out a press release on November 29, praising Republican lawmakers from Florida who had joined in a letter, available <a href="http://abir.createsend4.com/t/y/i/ydlyjhd/l/t/">here</a>, opposing the bill. The claim is that eliminating the tax avoidance technique will be a &#8220;punitive tax on reinsurance&#8221; that would &#8220;lead to higher premium costs&#8221; because it would &#8220;impose a tariff on international reinsurance firms&#8221;  and that this would amount to &#8220;punitive and anti-competitive taxes.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Florida Republican representatives note that 90% of Florida&#8217;s insurance is reinsured offshore.  The fact that such affiliate reinsurance is widespread does not mean that it is a better means of risk management.  The regular amount of US taxes that would be charged on those US affiliates&#8221; income is not a &#8220;punitive&#8221; tax: it is merely the amount of tax that those firms would pay if they do not use affiliates as reinsurers. </p>
<p>Note that moving the insurance to an affiliate doesn&#8217;t achieve the risk-shifting that reinsurance is designed to accomplish&#8211;it retains the risk within the controlled group.  (The IRS litigated a number of captive insurance cases under the theory that a controlled group constitutes a single economic &#8220;family&#8221; and hence cannot achieve risk-shift or risk-diversification.  Although courts were hesitant to adopt this theory, it does seem to capture the essence of the affiliate reinsurance problem.  The JCT report noted above also suggests the theory as a means of addressing the tax avoidance technique.)  Although lobbyists claim that reinsurance with affiliates is a valuable &#8220;risk-management&#8221; tool and that reinsurance with affiliates accomplishes the same risk management as reinsurance with non-affiliated parties, it seems that reinsurance within a controlled group does not provide the same risk protection as nonaffiliated reinsurance.   A catastrophic event covered by the reinsurer could result in liquidation of its assets, including its interest in the US affiliate.</p>
<p>Insurers using offshore affiliate reinsurers claim that there are nonetheless real non-tax advantages: (i) reducing adverse selection/moral hazard from information asymetry between insurer and reinsurer and (ii) &#8220;allowing risk and capital to be moved more easily &#8230; to respond to changing market conditions.&#8221;  See Cragg, Cummins &#038; Zhou, The Impact of a U.S. Tax on Offshore Reinsurance Market, The<a href="http://www.brattle.com/_documents/uploadlibrary/upload863.pdf">Brattle Group</a> , May 1, 2009 (research funded by the Coalition for Competitive Insurance Rates projecting a 2.1 &#8211; 2.4% rise in insurance costs upon elimination of the affiliate reinsurance scheme) (also cited in the JCT report for these claims). </p>
<p>These so-called advantages of affiliate reinsurance appear spurious.  First, while the interests of the insurer and its affiliated reinsurer are aligned (so that the insurer will have less incentive to select the worse policies for that affiliated reinsurer or to be lax in its policy making for policies it will reinsure with its affiliate), the absence of real risk-shifting would make that alignment of little real value.  Alternatively, as the JCT report notes, the aligning of interests may mean that the premium paid to affiliated reinsurers should be <em>lower</em> than the third-party premium, meaning that much of the affiliated reinsurance market may result in understatement of the US company&#8217;s income. Furthermore, nonaffiliated reinsurers may well undertake more comprehensive due diligence connected with taking on real reinsurance risk, and thus in fact contribute to a better risk-balanced insurance market.  </p>
<p>Second, the claim that reinsuring with offshore affiliates allows for easier movement of capital in response to market conditions is of little real benefit to the U.S. insurance market.  The foreign parent that reinsures the U.S. affiliate has received an advantage from having that reinsurance premium as its capital while at the same time reducing its US affiliate&#8217;s tax liability, but that merely substantiates the complaint of domestic companies that the ability to reinsure with a foreign affiliate gives an unjust  competitive advantage&#8211;the double whammy of the tax deduction to the US affiliate and the capital infusion to the foreign company.  Further, as we saw in the 2008 financial crisis,  globalization of interactions among financial companies can have deeply negative systemic effects. </p>
<p>On balance, eliminating the deduction for affiliate reinsurance premiums is not the creation of an &#8220;anti-competitive tax&#8221; whenthe insurer is using the affiliate to shift income offshore and avoid paying U.S. corporate taxes.   In fact, the ability of some insurance companies to offshore preimums is itself anti-competitive, since it puts wholly domestic U.S. insurance companies at a disadvantage.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In my first post here as an official Bear, I want to start by thanking Dan Crawford and the rest of the Clan of the Angry Bear for inviting me to join the party. I&#8217;ve been a regular lurker and occasional commenter for years, and have learned a huge amount from the experts here. I&#8217;m looking forward to contributing more regularly.</p>
<p>For my inaugural post, I&#8217;m going to break with my tradition and rather than inflicting data on you, I&#8217;m instead going to frame much of what I write in some big-picture ideology and theory.</p>
<p>I think this thinking does much to explain what Mike Kimel in particular has made so clear here over many years (with occasional help from <em>moi</em>): that based on the long-term historical record, by pretty much any economic measure it&#8217;s <em>progressive</em> policies that deliver superior growth, prosperity, fiscal responsibility, opportunity, individual liberty, and a vibrant, robust economy and society.</p>
<p><strong>How can that be?</strong> Aren&#8217;t Republicans &#8220;the party of growth&#8221;?</p>
<p>That question cuts straight to the reason I started blogging back in 2004. Back then I generally and rather unthinkingly accepted (at least provisionally) the dominant meme of Reaganomics &#8212; that larger government hurts economic growth. But I&#8217;ve always been a curious fellow (yes, in both senses&#8230;), so I started pulling data and crunching it to see for myself. (I am from Missouri, after all.)</p>
<p>I was pretty astounded at the time to find that the dominant meme just wasn&#8217;t true. Run the numbers various ways yourself, or do a review of the <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/small-government-spurs-growth-economists-say-no.html">professional</a> <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/an-open-letter-to-robert-barro.html">literature</a>, and you get the same results: <strong>in prosperous countries, government size has basically no correlation with long-term economic growth</strong> (even though government sizes vary <em>hugely</em> &#8212; from well under 30% of GDP up to 50%+). Go figger.</p>
<p>And that means that all the rhetoric, ideology, and theory supporting that meme has a problem. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that it was in fact wrong by a 180 degrees.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how I came to what I&#8217;m giving you here &#8212; a reprise, revision, and reworking of thinking I <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-party-of-prosperity-the-seven-reasons-that-democrats-policies-are-more-economically-efficient.html">wrote up</a> a couple of years ago:<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><strong>Alternate Title: </strong><br /><em><strong>The Nine Habits of Highly Efficient Economies</strong></em></p>
<p>Republican economic policies are widely perceived (especially by Republicans) as being pro-growth and pro-prosperity, even though <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&#038;hl=en&#038;rlz=1B7GGLL_enUS365US365&#038;q=site%3Awww.angrybearblog.com+cactus+democrat+republican&#038;aq=f&#038;aqi=&#038;aql=&#038;oq=">All</a>. <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/democrats-are-profligate-spendthrifts-oh-wait.html">The</a>. <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/pro-growth-republicans-get-real.html">Evidence</a>. <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/pro-growth-republicans-revisited.html">Demonstrates</a>. <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/where-did-the-deficit-come-from-conservatives-of-course.html">The</a>. <a href="http://www.blogger.com/pro-growth-republicans-debunked-again-some-more.html">Opposite</a>. <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-26-at-6.45.50-AM-433x500.png">Even the rich get richer under Democrats</a> (except for the very rich) &#8212; though not at the expense of the poor and the middle class.</p>
<p>Progressives deliver more prosperity. They deliver it to more people. And they do it without busting the budget.</p>
<p>How do they achieve all that? Through the miracles of economic efficiency &#8212; policies that make the markets actually work &#8212; and work better &#8212; for the greater prosperity of all.</p>
<div><strong>Wisdom of the Crowds.</strong> Democrats&#8217; dispersed government spending &#8212; education, health care, infrastructure, and social support &#8212; puts money (hence power) in the hands of individuals, instead of delivering concentrated streams to big entities like finance, defense, and business. Those individuals&#8217; free choices on where to spend the money allocate resources where they&#8217;re needed &#8212; to truly productive industries that deliver goods people actually want.</div>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>Preventing Government &#8220;Capture.&#8221; </strong>Money that goes to millions of individuals is much less subject to &#8220;capture&#8221; by powerful players, so it is much less likely to be used to then &#8220;capture&#8221; government via political donations, sweetheart deals, and crony capitalism. Those bogeyman &#8220;welfare queens&#8221; don&#8217;t have much power or presence on K Street. The Wall Street and Defense Welfare Queens quite decidedly, do.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Economic Stability. </strong>The social support programs put in place during and since the New Deal serve as automatic stabilizers for the economy, providing the kind of anticyclical fiscal policy that legislators and monetary authorities cannot &#8212; in their infinite discretion &#8212; be relied upon to deliver. Just as volatility trashes the returns on your investment portfolio, wild swings in the economy trash collective prosperity and the spectacular potential of compounding growth.</div>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>Labor Market Flexibility. </strong>When people feel confident that they and their families won&#8217;t end up on the streets &#8212; they know that their children will have health care, education, a measure of economic security, and a decent safety net if the worst happens &#8212; they feel free to move to a different job that better fits their talents &#8212; better allocating labor resources. &#8220;Labor market flexibility&#8221; often suggests the freedom (of employers) to hire and fire, but the freedom of hundreds of millions of employees is far more profound, economically.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Freedom to Innovate. </strong>Individuals who are standing on the social springboard that Democratic policies provide &#8212; who have that stable platform beneath them &#8212; have the economic freedom and security to strike out on their own and develop the kind of innovative, entrepreneurial ventures that are the true engine of long-term growth and prosperity (and personal freedom and satisfaction) &#8212; without worrying that their children will suffer terribly if the risk goes wrong. Give twenty, forty, or a hundred million more Americans a place to stand, and they&#8217;ll move the world.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Profitable Investments in Long-Term Growth. </strong>From education to infrastructure to scientific research, Democratic priorities deliver money to projects that the private market don&#8217;t support on their own, and that have been demonstrated to pay off many times over in widespread public prosperity.</p>
</div>
<div><strong><strong>Labor and Trade Efficiencies.</strong> </strong>The social support programs that Democrats champion &#8212; if they truly provide an adequate level of support &#8212; give policy makers much more freedom to put in place what are otherwise draconian, but efficient, trade and labor policies. If everyone who works is guaranteed a decent income by a program like the Earned Income Tax Credit, we have less need for the economically constricting effects often associated with unions and protectionism.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Power to the Producers. </strong>The dispersal of income and wealth under Democratic policies provides the widespread demand (read: sales) that producers need to succeed, to expand, and to take risks on innovative new endeavors. (There aren&#8217;t many rich people, so they can&#8217;t buy very many iPads.) Rather than assuming that government knows best and giving money directly to businesses and banks, Democratic policies trust the markets &#8212; the people &#8212; to direct that money to the most productive producers.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Fiscal Prudence. </strong><em>True conservatives pay their bills.</em> From the 35 years of declining debt/GDP after World War II (until 1982) to the years of declining debt under Bill Clinton, to the flattening of the debt runup that&#8217;s projected under Obama (after the historic spike that Reaganomics and Bushonomics has delivered), Democratic policies demonstrate which party deserves the name &#8220;fiscal conservatives.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div>These aren&#8217;t actually &#8220;the&#8221; nine reasons &#8212; there are many more (I haven&#8217;t even mentioned smart, sensible regulation) &#8212; but they&#8217;re a great starting point for the kind of thinking that needs to be repeated over and over, endlessly, for decades (a la the Republicans&#8217; incredibly effective long-term brainwashing campaign following the Powell memo), to bring about the change our country needs to thrive in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Progressives are the party of prosperity, of individual opportunity, and of economic freedom. The historical and comparative evidence shows it in spades, and there&#8217;s very coherent and convincing theory to explain why. That&#8217;s a lot of what I&#8217;ll be talking about here at the Bear. I&#8217;m excited to hear your thoughts.</p></div>

                                <p>Health Care thoughts: PPACA Employer Mandate Part 1</p>
<p>So I am trying to put together a template for evaluating the employer  health insurance mandate under PPACA&#8230;.</p>
<p>Some preliminary thoughts:</p>
<p>50 employees does not mean 50 employees, there as a Full Time Equivalent (FTE) calculation that is certain to confuse employers because it is different than any other FTE calculation we have ever seen.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />In the process of avoiding penalties employers need to obtain information about household income and number of persons in the household, but obtaining the information could be difficult and verifying the information could be impossible. Asking for the information before hiring could be illegal (opinions vary so far). Monitoring changes will be very difficult. And how will the government gather and update this information?</p>
<p>Smaller employers say 40 to 200 head count (or FTE) without sophisticated HR resources are going to be really confused.</p>
<p>This is gonna be interesting. Any thoughts from the Bears?</p>

<p>From an e-mail from guest contributor Michael Halasy:</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t necessarily know either. My research (Operations Research with a Workforce focus) is modeling many of these changes (stochastic, variable, simulation, etc.). I think Tom&#8217;s point is correct in that this will get interesting. We need better modeling data to determine this. A good friend is a senior fellow at Lewin, and I know he is doing a lot of this modeling now (impact of ACA on companies, physician practices)&#8230;..I think it&#8217;s simply too early right now&#8230;</p>
