                                <p>Yves Smith spells out her strong opinion of our dilemma nationally for the elections of 2012. This particular arena of regulating banks and non banks and and accountability also takes on a wider symbolic meaning in this election cycle.  How this plays out in determining national budget spending priorities through the lens of an explosion of money spent on national and state elections makes for a need for voters to pay close attention to actual issues and to gain some knowledge underlying economic understanding&#8230;a complicated task for a potentially interested public.  We in Mass. have another election to follow closely through Elizabeth Warren, who has a different take on the issues.

<blockquote><p>&#8230;So let’s return to the rebranding of Obama. From the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/64fd5abc-2042-11e1-8462-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz1fqUwRF2A">Financial Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Barack Obama outlined a plan to toughen penalties against banks that commit fraud in a speech on Tuesday that hardened his attacks on Republicans for “collective amnesia” in backing policies that caused the financial crisis and economic downturn.</p>
<p>Speaking in Osawatomie, Kansas, Mr Obama summoned the spirit of another president, Teddy Roosevelt, who spoke in the same city a century ago about his “new nationalism” and the need for a fairer system that supported the middle class..</p>
<p>Mr Obama was scathing about the banks’ opposition to new financial regulations, saying they were only feared by “financial institutions whose business model is built on breaking the law, cheating consumers or making risky bets that could damage the entire economy”.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>“I’ll be calling for legislation that makes [anti-fraud] penalties count – so that firms don’t see punishment for breaking the law as just the price of doing business.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The misdirection is blindingly obvious. The claim is that the Administration needs new tools to get tough on banks. No, it has plenty of tools, starting with Sarbanes Oxley. As <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/03/a-straightforward-criminal-case-against-wall-street-ceos-and-senior-executives.html">we’ve discussed at length in earlier posts</a>, Sarbox was designed to eliminate the CEO and top brass “know nothing” excuse. And the language for civil and criminal charges is parallel, so a prosecutor could file civil charges, and if successful, could then open up a related criminal case. Sarbox required that top executives (which means at least the CEO and CFO) certify the adequacy of internal controls, and for a big financial firm, that has to include risk controls and position valuation. The fact that the Administration didn’t attempt to go after, for instance, AIG on Sarbox is inexcusable. The “investigation” done by Andrew Ross Sorkin in his Too Big To Fail (Willumstad not having a good handle on the cash bleed, the sudden discovery of a $20 billion hole in the securities lending portfolio, the mysterious “unofficial vault” with billions of dollars of securities in file cabinets) all are proof of an organization with seriously deficient controls.</p>
<p>But more broadly, it’s blindingly obvious this Administration has never had the slightest interest in doing anything more serious than posture. <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/03/the-empire-continues-to-strike-back-team-obama-propaganda-campaign-reaches-fever-pitch.html">As we wrote in early 2010</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recall how we got here. Early in 2009, the banking industry was on the ropes. Both the stock and the credit default swaps markets said that many of the big players were at serious risk of failure. Commentators debated whether to nationalize Citibank, Bank of America, and other large, floundering institutions..</p>

                                <p>As the Senate election begins in earnest in Massachusetts, with a great deal of money already pledged and attack ads begun, the contest has the ability to capture the nation&#8217;s attention and imagination.  We will be following aspects of the election for our readers as the year progresses. Re posted is a statement she made on regulation and the role of non-banks in our system.  Of course the issues are ongoing today:
<p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/09/elizabeth-warren-exclusive.html">Angry Bear post 2009</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/?p=4454">Elizabeth Warren</a> of the Congressional Oversight Committee for TARP, and champion of an active voice for consumer protection regulation, offers her thoughts in <i>Real Change: Turning up the heat on non-bank lenders </i>with one of her latest essays at <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/">New Deal 2.0</a>, part of the <a href="http://rooseveltinstitution.org/">Roosevelt Institution</a>.    <br />We have watched regulation slip away, which is of course not always bad, through terminating good rules, decreased funding to an agency to make enforcement less of an issue, and leadership in an agency to change the intent of regulatory function.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>The big banks are storming Washington, determined to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPA). They understand that a regulator who actually cares about consumers would cause a seismic change in their business model: No more burying the terms of the agreement in the fine print, no more tricks and traps. If the big banks lose the protection of their friendly regulators, the business model that produces hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue — and monopoly-size profits that exist only in non-competitive markets — will be at risk. That’s a big change. <a name="more"></a>  <br />But there is an even bigger change in the wind: regulating the non-banks. Democrats and Republicans alike agree that the proliferation of unregulated, non-bank lenders contributed significantly to the financial crisis by feeding millions of dangerous financial products into the economic system. Non-bank institutions were active participants in the race to the bottom among lenders. From subprime mortgage loans to small dollar loans, they showed how to wring high fees and staggering interest rates out of consumer lending. Their fine-print contracts, and new tricks and traps, transformed the market.    <br />Despite widespread agreement about the problem, the U.S. has never made a sustained, systemic effort to regulate non-bank lenders&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;As lending abuses became more obvious, there was no effort to close regulatory gaps and loopholes or to devote federal resources toward the oversight of non-bank institutions. The reasons are many, but one of the most benign explanations is that policymakers for too long assumed that states could deal with the non-banks because the non-bank lenders are often small and often operate locally (although Countrywide showed that state-based organizations can metastasize rapidly). As it turns out, the states actually faced several limitations in reining in these lenders.   <br />States, just like the federal government, were subject to intense lobbying by creditors. In short order, many states changed their rules to undercut basic protections. For example, the consumer finance industry succeeded in rewriting state interest rate regulation to allow for massive increases in allowable effective rates — even when the advertised rate looks far lower and obscures the true cost of credit. In many states, making an end run around local usury laws is now as easy as running around a single fencepost. At the same time, state legislatures face the perpetual lag-behind problem. They are unable to adjust to a rapidly changing financial services market, too slow to identify problems and not capable of changing the laws quickly enough to head off serious problems.    <br />Moreover, resources are always constrained at the state level, and the enforcement of consumer credit laws competes with a wide variety of other state obligations. When consumer credit laws were violated, states often lacked the capacity to undertake serious investigations or to prosecute offenders. Some states made heroic efforts, but others left consumer financial issues far down their priority list.    <br />The problem of enforcement has been exacerbated by a serious structural problem. When an abuse surfaced-for example, a local paper ran a news story about an unfair practice or a consumer group assembled evidence of sharp practices-local officials often responded by jumping on small banks. The non-banks were often scattered and difficult to find, while the biggest financial institutions were typically protected from local prosecution through pre-emption. That left the small banks holding the bag. These small banks, often those with state charters, were the easiest institutions to locate and the cheapest to prosecute — even if they were only tangentially involved in deceptive practices. The result was that the worst offenders slipped away. Non-banks could shut down for a while, and then reappear when the heat was off. In effect, the state enforcement structure benefitted the big banks and the non-banks.    <br />The CFPA presents the first real opportunity to change that harmful structure.    <br />First, the CFPA will regulate consumer financial products across the board-using the same rules for all mortgages or for all small dollar loans, regardless of whether the mortgage or the loan is issued by a national bank, a state bank or a non-bank. The old practice of different sets of rules and different regulatory structures for the same products would disappear. Instead, the CFPA would create a coordinated set of baseline rules applicable across the board.    <br />Consolidated rule-making will also stop the practice of lenders shopping around for the regulator with the weakest rules. Bank holding companies have enjoyed an enormous advantage by having the freedom to structure their many business divisions to exploit regulatory weakness. They can operate a federally chartered bank when preemption is valuable to them. At the same time, they can purchase the products of non-banks in bulk, creating informal partnerships that exploit gaps in the state regulatory system. In fact, the Center for Public Integrity found that 21 of the 25 largest subprime issuers leading up to the crisis were financed by large banks. (Remember this the next time you hear a lobbyist blaming the crisis on non-banks and denying the role of the bank holding companies.) With consistent rules across the board, the CFPA would put an end to these practices.    <br />Consistent rules are important, but, as we now know, it isn’t enough to have good rules on the books. There must also be a serious effort to enforce those rules. With the right sources of funding and some smart strategic thinking about how to force non-banks to follow the same rules as other lenders, the entire landscape of consumer lending would change.    <br />From history, we have learned that an agency’s source of funding is critical to its success. By allowing the Agency to tax lenders directly — perhaps a dime for every open credit card account, a quarter for every open mortgage, etc. — Congress can make sure that the CFPA stays well-funded in the years ahead. The right funding structure will allow the Agency to develop the capacity to go after the non-banks and the dangerous products they originate, and it will insulate the Agency from political efforts to starve-the-regulators into inaction. Moreover, as we now know, the cost of even a well-funded agency is dwarfed by the cost to the government and the economy as a whole of bank failures. The cost of the failure of just one thrift – IndyMac — was almost ten times the annual budget of the Securities and Exchange Commission.    <br />New forms of strategic thinking will also be needed. By creating a system for mandatory lender registration, for example, CFPA will be able to keep track of the consumer lenders out there — something that no current regulators have the tools to do. To encourage compliance, the CFPA can work with other federal agencies — like the Treasury Department or the Internal Revenue Service — to identify unregistered lenders. In states that already register certain non-bank lenders, the CFPA can work off those registrations and collaborate with state officials. This is tough work, but a consumer agency with expertise and resources will rise to the challenge.    <br />The CFPA can also get smarter with enforcement by exploiting concentration points, places where small players are effectively grouped together. In the case of mortgage brokers, for example, without the large bank holding companies and their subsidiaries as customers for the loans they place, many would be out of business. Focusing regulatory attention on the buyers would create substantial leverage over the brokers as well. If the sponsors and funding mechanisms for the worst practices go away, so will the worst practices.    <br />There is more that we can do to deal with non-bank lenders, but only if Congress creates a strong CFPA. If we stick with the status quo — which treats loans differently depending on who issues them and places consumer protection in agencies that consider it an afterthought &#8211; we know what will happen because we have seen it happen before. Lenders will continue their tricks and traps business model, the mega-banks will exploit regulatory loopholes, and the non-banks will continue to sell deceptive products. In that world, small banks will need to choose between lowering standards or losing market share, and they will still get too much attention from regulators while the non-banks and big banks get too little. Dangerous loans will destabilize both families and the economy, and we’ll all remain at risk for the next trillion-dollar bailout.    <br />Regulating the non-banks hasn’t been tried in any serious way. The CFPA offers a real chance to level the playing field, to add balance to the system, and to change the consumer lending landscape forever.</p></blockquote>

<p>A Simple Question about NGDP Targeting</p>
<p>It seems that a big part of the econosphere these days talks about NGDP targeting.  Translating this into English, a number of economists believe the Fed should be adjusting monetary policy to achieve a desired level of nominal GDP in any given year.  To be very precise, both the economese and the English should be adjusted slightly to explain what is really meant:  the Fed should be adjusting monetary policy to achieve a given desired rate of nominal GDP in any given year</p>
<p>To me there are two very obvious problems with this.  The first should be evident to anyone who ever spent time in South America in the 1970s or 1980s, or has so much as heard of, say, Zimbabwe or the Weimar Republic:  why should the Fed or anyone else care about nominal growth rates?  Nominal figures are useful for <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/01/in-my-opinion-thomas-sowell-is-hack.html">Sowellizing</a>, which apparently can be very profitable, but in the end, only inflation adjusted figures tells us whether we&#8217;re better off or not.  </p>
<p>But there is a second problem, <a name="more"></a>  and the easiest way to state it is by analogy.  Think of the Fed as the quarterback on an American football team.  I don&#8217;t much like American football, but it is evident that the goal of a quarterback is not to throw a specific number of completed passes, or even to get certain score the board.  The goal is to do what it takes to win the game.  Getting 28 points doesn&#8217;t help you if the other team walks away with 35.  On the other hand, 28 to 21 achieves the quarterback&#8217;s goal nicely.  (And of course, whether 28 points looks impressive or not depends on a number things, including the condition of your teammates and the other team&#8217;s defense.)  For a good quarterback, winning the game sometimes means mostly staying out of the way, while at other times it means taking charge.  But specific measurable numbers mean nothing in the end. </p>
<p>Now, the Fed has a dual mandate (imposed by law):  set policy to maximize employment and keep prices stable.  Of course, the two goals conflict to some extent.  Stable prices means keeping inflation rates at about zero, which nobody advocates as it would generate slow economic growth (and thus low levels of employment).  Maximizing employment could be accomplishing economic growth rates, but the Fed often tries to slow down growth rates in order to prevent the onset of inflation.  </p>
<p>The Fed is left with something that loosely translates as this:  &#8220;try to get the economy to grow as quickly as possible without setting off too much inflation.&#8221;  It accomplishes that goal to a greater or lesser extent at different times.  </p>
<p>But given the number of moving parts out there, that seems to be a much easier, and much more logical approach than saying:  let&#8217;s shoot for a 3% increase in nominal GDP this year.  </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Lest this post be seen as a defense of the way the Fed does its job, I should note:  I personally think the Fed has been doing a very poor job for quite a while, and some of my earliest posts are criticisms of the Fed.  I&#8217;m especially horrified by the Fed&#8217;s approach to the economic mess we&#8217;re in &#8211; as I&#8217;ve been noting since 2008, ensuring that institutions with insane and harmful business models survive to engage in more spectacularly bad behavior is no way to help the economy, and that is true whether one has NGDP targets or not.</p>

                                <p>Maggie Mahar has been has been showcased at Angry Bear in prior years, mainly in regards to healthcare, but has written on many topics with an economic theme.  I am happy to announce she has agreed to write for Angry Bear, so please welcome her when her first post or two appears.  Of course, readers, I am sure you will provide ample comment in the Angry Bear tradition.  The following is a quick bio:</p>
<p>Maggie Mahar is the author of Money-Driven Medicine: The Real Reason Health Care Costs So Much (Harper/Collins 2006) and Bull! A History of the Boom, 1982–1999 (Harper/Collins, 2003), a book that Warren Buffett recommended in Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s annual report.</p>
<p>She also narrated <a target="_blank" href="http://www.moneydrivenmedicine.org/">Money-Driven Medicine</a>, a  film based on her book, produced by Alex Gibney (best known for Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room ) and directed by Andy Fredericks. <br />Bill Moyers called  it &#8220;one of the strongest documentaries I have seen in years.&#8221; </p>
<p>From 2007 to  2011, she wrote the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/www.healthbeatblog.org">HealthBeatBlog</a>, focusing on the economics and politics of heatlh care reform. The blog drew a loyal following made up of  medical professionals, health policy experts,  patient advocates., and others willing to take a skeptical look at our health care system.   </p>
<p>Before beginning to specialize in health care, Mahar was a financial journalist. From the late eighties through the late nineties, she worte cover stories for Barron&#8217;s.. There, she covered  both Wall Street and  Washington, investigating and profiling corporate America while also writing about financial markets in the U.,S and abroad, with an emphasis on Japan and Russia.. After leaving Barron&#8217;s, she wrote a column about international markets and economics for Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Before becoming a journalist,Mahar was an English professor at Yale University.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2011/12/johnston-income-inequality.html">Taxprofblog</a> comes David Cay Johnston&#8217;s <em>Income Inequality Increases as Bank Regulation, Prosecutions Decrease</em> through Reuters, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/2011/12/04/the-taxpayers-burden/">The Taxpayers’ Burden</a>, by <a href="http://www.perfectlylegalthebook.com/author.htm">David Cay Johnston</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The accompanying graphic shows a fascinating correlation. In the years before New Deal regulation of banks and after the easing of regulations began in 1980, bank failures were quite high. So was income inequality.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/files/2011/12/US_BNKFAIL1211_SC.jpg"><img title="US_BNKFAIL1211_SC" alt="" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/files/2011/12/US_BNKFAIL1211_SC.jpg" width="500" height="350"></a></p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>But from about 1933, when the federal regulation of banks was put in place, to 1980, when Chicago School theories began to shape policy, bank failures were rare. During those years incomes were much more equal, with a prosperous middle class. &#8230;</p>
<p>Correlation is not causality, but the fact that income inequality rose as banking regulations were eased makes sense. Freed of restraints, banks got into all sorts of activities that generated fees and saddled clients with high-interest debt. And once banks could collect fees for mortgages without having to worry about repayment — because the mortgages were sold off by Wall Street — the crucial link between reward and responsibility was severed.</p>
<p>With loosened financial regulation it would seem smart to increase law enforcement. Instead, enforcement was cut, as the chart from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse shows. Based on Justice Department internal reports, it shows criminal prosecutions involving financial firms down sharply since fiscal 1999.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>These findings about bank failures, income inequality and lack of prosecutions all take us back to the coordinated attempt by the central banks of the United States, Britain, Canada, the European Union, Japan and Switzerland to delay the day of reckoning on European debt. &#8230; Given the revolving doors that allow the financial class to move smoothly between government, central banks and financial firms throughout the modern world, and how those in power in all of these places have invested their reputations in Chicago School theories, my educated guess is that taxpayers will be stuck with the costs. Let’s hope I am wrong.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Numbers Behind Newt&#8217;s Plan to Balance the Budget</p>
<p>Newt Gingrich&#8217;s website provides information on <a href="http://www.newt.org/solutions/jobs-economy">The Gingrich Jobs and Prosperity Plan</a>.  It starts with this:  </p>
<blockquote><p>America only works when Americans are working. Newt has a pro-growth strategy similar to the proven policies used when he was Speaker to balance the budget, pay down the debt, and create jobs. </p></blockquote>
<p>Excellent.  That statement should be enough to get an idea of what the program will look like.  I want to focus on the first piece:  balancing the budget. (You can&#8217;t pay down the debt unless you run a surplus, so balancing the budget also deals with that issue.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the surplus / GDP looks like for the years from 1988 to 2004.  The gray bar covers the years from 1995 (the Republican Revolution took office, and Newt Gingrich became speaker in 1995) to 1998 (Gingrich resigned as speaker in November 1998.)</p>
<p>(Incidentally &#8211; the surplus is simply Total Federal Receipts less Total Federal Expenditures, which come from lines 37 and 40 of the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=9&#038;step=1">National Income and Product Accounts Table 3.2</a>.  GDP comes also comes from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">BEA</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nVPk_K2elno/Ttwok_cI9LI/AAAAAAAAAxw/F18FsfQFySY/s1600/Newt_Figure_1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nVPk_K2elno/Ttwok_cI9LI/AAAAAAAAAxw/F18FsfQFySY/s320/Newt_Figure_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As you can see, the deficit did indeed turn into a surplus when Gingrich was in office.  However, the chart makes it clear the trend began before Newt took office and continued after Newt left office.  In fact, it seems that the deficit started falling in 1993.  The surplus, on the other hand, peaked in the year 2000, fell, and the budget returned to a deficit.  So what defined the years from 1993-2000?  Oh yeah, they were the years Clinton was President.  So Newt is basically saying he would support the policies that produced success in the Clinton years.  </p>
<p>That is wonderful&#8230; those were years of great prosperity.  You have to go back to the JFK &#038; LBJ years to find presidents who oversaw faster growth rates in real GDP.  But let&#8217;s stay focused on the deficit and surplus issue.  In fact, let&#8217;s deconstruct the number into its constituent parts.   Figure 2 shows Total Federal Receipts / GDP and Total Federal Expenditures / GDP.  </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_c3tYqZvztE/Ttwok0P3RZI/AAAAAAAAAx8/dd7clNlTomc/s1600/Newt_Figure_2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_c3tYqZvztE/Ttwok0P3RZI/AAAAAAAAAx8/dd7clNlTomc/s320/Newt_Figure_2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>As is evident from Figure 2, Total Federal Receipts / GDP hit a low point in 1992 and started to rise in 1993, eventually peaking in the year 2000 and then falling.  Total Federal Expenditures / GDP hit a high point in 1992, then began falling in 1993, eventually hitting a local nadir in 2000 and then starting to rise again.  The trend during the Newt Gingrich years looks like the rest of Clinton years&#8230; well, except for a slight slowing in the rate at which expenditures were dropping.  </p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking that Newt&#8217;s comments about deficit reduction speak more to his views on expenditures than on taxes.  After all, few Republicans talk about increasing the tax burden these days and it would take a lot of guts for Newt to break with his party on this one.  But looking once more at the numbers its obvious Newt really does want Americans to pay more.  </p>
<p>Consider&#8230;  in 1995, Gingrich&#8217;s first year as speaker, federal expenditures were 22% of GDP.In 1998, they were 20% of GDP.  But&#8230;  revenues in 1995 were 19.2% of GDP.  That is to say, had revenues remained at the 1995 level, they would have been less than expenditures and the budget would have still been deficit Newt&#8217;s last year in office (and in fact, in 1999 as well).  But Newt takes credit for balancing the budget.  </p>
<p>Thus&#8230;  by necessity he is taking credit for raising the tax burden on the American people.   Granted, there were no hikes in the marginal rate while he was speaker, but the increase in the tax burden came about with increased enforcement and regulation.  This is a  man with political courage!  This is a man who puts doing the right thing above any thoughts of personal gain! </p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;d like to put the tax hikes that Newt seems to be advocating in context.  For this, I&#8217;m going to steal a graph from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Facts-Presidents-Measure-Issues/dp/B005HKSK8M/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0">Presimetrics</a>, the book I coauthored with Michael Kanell.  In it, we used a slightly different version of the tax burden:  instead of Federal Revenues / GDP, we looked at the percentage of people&#8217;s income that went to taxes.   We looked at the annualized rate of change of this version of the tax burden for each Congressional administration from 1952 to 2008.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we found:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E20x9DhypGc/TtwollW_ImI/AAAAAAAAAyI/U7x0mQ5Y-HA/s1600/Newt_Figure_3.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E20x9DhypGc/TtwollW_ImI/AAAAAAAAAyI/U7x0mQ5Y-HA/s320/Newt_Figure_3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3.</p>
<p>As Figure 3 shows, the Republican Revolution (which granted, extended a few years beyond Newt) oversaw the largest (by far!!!) annualized increase in the tax burden of any Congress in several decades!  Because taxes aren&#8217;t that popular with Republicans these days, Newt is downplaying the issue, but he seems to be dogwhistling it for those of with some familiarity with the numbers.  The only alternatives are that he is ignorant of the numbers, or that he is will to obfuscate the facts, but hopefully we can expect more than that from someone running for the highest office in the land.</p>

<blockquote><p>What caused the housing bubble?</p>
<p>This is a different, though related, question from what caused the collapse of the financial sector or why unemployment is sky-high right now. Why did housing value skyrocket and then collapse? More broadly, why did all kinds of consumer debt expand so greatly over the past decade?<br />&#8230;<br />there’s another argument, which looks at the explosion of international lending and the indebtedness of the United States by foreign investors. Normally capital runs from rich countries to poor countries, but something changed where it reversed as capital went rushing to the United States. This exposed the United States to the same kind of risks developing nations usually face. And the new book Lost Decades by Menzie D. Chinn and Jeffry A. Frieden, economists at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and Harvard, is the best book-length treatment of this argument.</p></blockquote>
<p>(italics mine)<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2011/11/solving_america_1.html">Menzie Chin</a> writes about Lost Decades at Econbrowser:</p>
<p>&#8230;Jeffry Frieden and I conclude in our book, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~mchinn/lostdecades.html">Lost Decades</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>America’s prosperity requires fiscal responsibility. The phrase “fiscal responsibility” has been used so much that it is something between an obligatory buzzword and a code word for cutting government spending. In our view, true fiscal responsibility involves a willingness to raise sufficient tax revenue, over the longer term, to pay for the programs the government implements. Fiscal responsibility should not be equated with a small government, but rather with a commitment to pay for the government services provided. If the nation affirms that enhancing national defense and improving health care for the poor are legitimate goals, fiscal responsibility entails raising the revenue to fund these programs, rather than borrowing for them.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Cost of Education Is Crushing the Opportunity We Mean It to Provide</p>
<p>The Occupy Wall Street movement has no formal goals but several consistent memes have emerged among the crowd demonstrations in various cities across the country. Most of these have to do with the concentration of wealth and the collusion/corruption between big business and government. However, a more selfish trend also has surfaced among the demonstrators – many want their college student loans forgiven.  </p>
<p>A small, informal survey among New York protestors last week by equity research analyst David Maris found ninety-three percent of them advocated student-loan clemency. This idea actually is neither original to OWS nor unique among its members.</p>

<p><i>Sign bewailing large student loan debt</i>             <br /><i>from one Occupy Wall Street protestor</i></p>

<p>New York University Professor Andrew Ross recently proposed a radical solution to student loan debts the he calls “A Pledge of Refusal.” The idea requires those who owe to sign a pledge to stop making payments on their student loans once the pledge garners a million signatures. Meanwhile, an online petition supporting student loan forgiveness has collected over a half million signatures.   </p>
<p>President Obama announced a plan last week to provide student loan relief. First, he is reducing the maximum repayment on student loans from fifteen percent of discretionary annual income to ten percent. Second, he will allow borrowers to combine loans from the Family Education Loan Program with direct government loans, with a lower consolidated interest rate. Obama plans to use his Executive authority to bypass Congress for this program.   </p>
<p>Democratic Representative Hansen Clarke of Michigan wants to go even further. He has introduced legislation (H.R. 365) that includes creating incentives for banks to negotiate with distressed lenders, providing tax credits for education expenses and student loan debt, and making more private student loans eligible for discharge in bankruptcy proceedings.   <br />Both Obama’s and Clarke’s solutions fall short of general clemency but protestors are unlikely to obtain this remedy. A Rasmussen poll found only twenty-one percent of American adults in favor of blanket forgiveness as contrasted to sixty-six percent opposed. Many feel clemency would be unfair to lenders as well as those borrowers who repaid their student loans. At worst, they write off OWS protestors and other advocates for loan forgiveness as spoiled, lazy slackers who expect a free ride.   </p>
<p>Such epithets are unfair, counters conservative columnist Nicholas Kristoff this week in the <i>New York Times</i>. “While alarmists seem to think that the movement is a ‘mob’ trying to overthrow capitalism, one can make a case that, on the contrary, it highlights the need to restore basic capitalist principles like accountability.” Kristoff goes on to deplore how “some financiers have chosen to live in a government-backed featherbed. Their platform seems to be socialism for tycoons and capitalism for the rest of us . . . they can privatize profits while socializing risk.”   <br />Representative Clarke concurs that most protestors “are not asking for [a bailout]. They are simply asking for a system that is not rigged against them.” When big bankers and investment firms can make poor decisions without suffering obvious consequences, then the motivation for individuals requesting similar absolution may not be admirable but it is understandable.   <br />While the current crop of students and recent graduates may be whining about the problem more than past generations, they face an objectively bigger problem. This year, the average borrower graduating from a four-year college left school with roughly $24,000 of student debt, with ten percent facing debt of $40,000 or more, according to the College Board. Total student loan debt will exceed $1 trillion this year and it now exceeds outstanding credit card debt, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.   </p>
<p>Only seven percent of graduating bachelor’s degree holders come from the bottom quarter of income earners, as compared to twelve percent back in 1970. Intended as relief and opportunity for the distressed poor, student loans have become an unavoidable middle class reality. In addition, a series of laws passed by Congress last decade have increased the difficulty of discharging debt, including student loans, through bankruptcy.   <br />The website <i>College Scholarships</i> reports on several programs that forgive or reduce student loan debt for graduates willing to work in high need/disadvantaged areas. The problem is such programs are limited to highly targeted professions, such as nurses, attorneys, and teachers. What is more, they often require a minimum of five years experience. Traditionally, graduates take such jobs immediately after graduation to acquire experience, when they are most inclined to social activism and less acclimated in their lifestyles to larger salaries.   </p>
<p>I attended college for six years, ultimately earning a master’s level degree in 1984. I won several scholarships, based on merit; qualified for several grants, based on need; and I worked. In spite of this, I fell short of the necessary money for tuition and books on a couple of occasions. I took out a couple of federal student loans to make up the difference that I was able to repay within a few years of graduation.   </p>
<p>Contrast my experience with that of Robert Applebaum, who graduated from Fordham Law School in 1998 with about $65,000 in debt. After going to work as an Assistant District Attorney in Brooklyn, his salary forced him to put his student loans in “forbearance,” which prevents default but allows continued accrual of interest. Applebaum began repaying his loans upon leaving the DA’s office in 2004 but remains $88,000 in debt today.   <br />Tommaso Boggia is an MPA candidate at Presidio Graduate School and an advocate for student loan clemency. He writes at the website <i>Triple Pundit</i>, “Regardless of work ethic, more and more middle class families are slipping into poverty, in part because of the heavy debt burden of house ownership and of pursuing a higher education degree . . . A whole generation is seeing their plans and ambitions shackled by the extra weight of their student loan payments. These young people are unable to buy a home, start a family, or do the socially important but underpaid jobs in the social services sector.”   </p>
<p>In the post-World War II era, a college education was the chief means by which children from working poor families could leapfrog into the middle class or even affluence. Increasingly, however, the cost of this requirement is becoming the very thing holding them back from the opportunities promised by the American Dream.  </p>
<p>The most cited reason for exploding debt is the ever-increasing cost of college. Average in-state tuition and fees at four-year public colleges rose an additional eight point three percent in 2001 alone, passing $8,000/year ($17,000/year with room and board). In addition, the American Council on Education notes that budget cuts and other austerity measures have reduced state appropriations to higher education by eighteen percent over the last three years.   </p>
<p>Richard Vedder, Director of the Center for College Affordability and Productivity and author of the book <i>Going Broke by Degree – Why College Costs Too Much</i>, maintains that we are looking at the problem exactly backwards. Writing in the <i>National Review</i>, he argues that just as an abundance of easily obtainable, low interest mortgages spurred the housing bubble that caused the 2008 financial crisis, “Arguably, federal student financial assistance is creating a second bubble in higher education.”   </p>
<p>Vedder also points out that government doles out loans without discrimination to a student’s prospects of success in college, despite the fact that over forty percent of those pursuing a bachelor’s degree fail to receive one within six years, or chances of success after college, regardless of whether a student’s field of study offers poor versus good job/career availability. During a 2011 <i>PBS NewsHour</i> appearance, Vedder argued American society must “open up opportunities for people to consider a variety of different options after high school, one of which is college, but there are many others.”  </p>
<p>Most of us may not agree with those advocating total clemency for student loan debt. While this solution may be overly simplistic and impractical, it seems clear that some reforms are necessary – whether the efficiencies proposed by Obama, the incentives proposed by Clarke, or Vedder’s more draconian measures toward higher education in general. It also means we need to give OWS protestors and other loan forgiveness advocates more credit for identifying a real, substantive, and systemic problem beyond their selfish interests.  </p>
<p>If we value an education for our children as much as we claim, our society has to find a way to re-engineer it back from the crushing burden it has become to more of the opportunity we aspire it to be. Right now, the main thing we are teaching our kids is learning to owe. This is neither opportunity nor American exceptionalism. </p>
