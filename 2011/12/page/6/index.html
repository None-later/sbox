<p>[edited 2 pm 12/13 to provide additional links to news coverage of some of the changes]</p>
<p>Congress has been playing politics as usual over the few policies that are on the table that have a real chance of assisting, to some degree, the plight of ordinary Americans and perhaps even the slow recovery that is still trying to gain steam&#8211;extension of the reduction in payroll taxes (from 6.2% to 4.2%) and extension of unemployment compensation.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The Republicans have refused to pay for these common sense tax reductions for ordinary Americans with a similarly common sense tax increase on the wealthiest Americans who have continued to capture all the productivity gains in the economyt.  Republicans in the House think that these kinds of provisions should be offset by more goodies for the &#8220;uberclass&#8221;&#8211;at least as evidenced by the <a href="http://rules.house.gov/Media/file/PDF_112_1/legislativetext/HR_1209.pdf">H.R. 3630</a>, the bill introduced by Dave Camp (R-MI) and to be voted on today at about 4:30 pm. </p>
<ul>
<li>It would restructure unemployment compensation in ways that add hurdles and make it less likely that unemployed Americans will qualify&#8211;providing more state flexibility and experimentation (including paying employers to cover part of cost of wages exceeding the recipient&#8217;s prior benefit level), permitting demeaning drug testing of all unemployment compensation recipients (section 2127), and requiring a high school diploma or participation in state &#8220;reemployment services&#8221; for which recipients may be charged up to $5 weekly out of their unemployment compensation.  It would severely curtail the total number of weeks for which federal unemployment assistance is available&#8211;moving to a 59-week limit from a 99-week limit.  Methinks I see Scrooge here&#8230;.. </li>
<li>It will interfere with the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s ability to regulate, letting corporations continue to harm the environment at the expense of ordinary Americans.   See Subtitle B.  Section 1102(b) lists rules that are &#8220;stayed&#8221; by the legislation and provides that no new rules can have an effective date earlier than 5 years out and requires consideration of various factors in determining that date.  Further, it requires adoption of the laxer 2000 definitions for certain key terms and the imposition of the &#8220;least burdensome&#8221; among potential regulatory alternatives.  This is a key cave-in to corporate polluters.  </li>
<li>It will expedite the KeystoneXL pipeline by requiring a permit to be issued within 60 days unless within that time the President determines that the pipeline will not serve the national interest (in which case within 15 days the President must provide various committees and members of Congress a report justifying that conclusion from various perspectives).  It indicates that the environmental impact statement from August will be treated as satisfactory for environmental and historical preservation purposes and shall not have to be supplemented if there are modifications to the plan  and no further federal environmental review shall be allowed.  This is a clearly ideologically driven provision, failing to give due regard to the potential longterm environmental impact on drinking water aquifers or historical preservation impact.  </li>
<li>It would provide yet another tax reduction for US corporations that have paid less and less taxes over the last decade, with a renewal of the ill-advised 100% expensing provision in section 168(k)(5) (along with the alternative of accelerating AMT credits) </li>
<li>it makes further changes to medicare such as applying a cap to hospital outpatient therapy services and reversing part of the Health Reform Act passed earlier, by permitting new doctor-owned hospitals and permitting existing ones to expand, even though it has been shown that such hospitals spend more on testing and procedures (and profit more from them).  See, e.g., Pear, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/health/policy/republican-tax-and-unemployment-bill-would-help-hospitals-owned-by-doctors.html">G.O.P. Bill Would Benefit Doctor Owned Hospitals</a>, New York Times at A24, Dec. 13, 2011. </li>
<li>it would continue funding for the &#8220;healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood&#8221; initiative, see <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_42_00000603----000-.html">42 U.S.C. section 603(a)(2)</a>  (the cynic in me suspects that these funds primarily go to programs supported by religious institutions and that they proselytize more than they teach reasonable relationship skills) </li>
<li>it includes an extensive section remaking flood insurance provisions, including, in section 3005, lifting the cap for premium increases for flood insurance from 10% to 20% (an apparent boon to insurers), and another section prohibiting the administration from &#8220;disregarding&#8221; any levee or floodwall, even if it is not accredited.  <strong>The goal, made clear in section 3009, is privatization of the national flood insurance program</strong>. </li>
<li>It includes extensive broadband spectrum auction provisions in Title IV, Subtitle A, reallocating spectrum from federal to nonfederal use.  These provisions, among many detailed ones, e.g., <strong>permit private administrators of state public safety networks to use the public spectrum for private purposes as well as the public safety  purpose</strong>and prevent states from denying requests for modifications of existing wireless towers that do not substantially change the physical dimensions thereof. </li>
<li>It increases the guarantee fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. </li>
<li>It requires a social security number for the refundable child credit</li>
<li>It provides in section 5895 a 100% tax on &#8220;excess unemployment benefits&#8221; that go to millionaires (unemployment compensation is reduced proportionately as the adjusted gross income increases from $750,000 to $1 million)&#8211;The Times today has an article on the bill and notes that the number of millionaires receiving unemployment compensation is very small, but that their participation is predicated on the fact that the unemployment compensation program is a type of insurance into which payments are made to cover payouts.  <strong>Means testing such insurance programs is in sync with the right-wing goal of means-testing as a prelude to privatizing and/or eliminating all federally administered social welfare insurance programs, such as medicare and Social Security (and, see above, national flood insurance).</strong></li>
<li>It increases pension contributions from longterm federal workers by .5% a year for 2012-2014 and for those &#8220;secure annuity employees&#8221; with less than five years of service, by more than 10% a year and using 5 year average pay rather than 3 year average pay, sets annuity amounts, and ends the annuity supplement for post-2012 retirees. </li>
<li>it extends the general freeze on federal pay for another year</li>
<li>It increases the premiums for Medicare Part B and Part D for those making $80,000 or more (for those making $200,000 or more, the applicable percentage is 90%)&#8211;this again appears to move these national social welfare insurance programs towards more means-testing that will facilitate privatization or eventual elimination.  </li>
<li><strong>It sets up a number of procedural hurdles in the Senate, which is already hogtied by the ease with which a minority of its members can filibuster and thus stop legislation that is supported by a solid majority of its members.  For examples,</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>it requires a 2/3 vote in the Senate to amend the dates for section 601(c) of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr4853enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr4853enr.pdf">2010 Tax Relief Act</a>&#8211;that&#8217;s the temporary employee payroll tax cut;</strong></li>
<li><strong>it provides that a point of order by any Senator against an emergency designation in a bill eliminates that designation and makes it impossible to bring the designation through a floor amendment unless there is a supermajority 3/5 vote in favor of doing so (limiting debate to 1 hour)&#8211;thus one right-wing Senator intent on obstructionism can make it very unlikely that an important provision can pass by preventing even reasonable debate about the importance of the provision!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The GOP, of course, touts its bill as creating jobs.   While the Keystone pipeline may create some short-term jobs (the New YorkTimes reports estimates from Transcanada itself  and the State Department of only about 6500 temporary construction jobs  and maybe 50 permanent new jobs&#8211;see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/opinion/keystone-claptrap.html">Keystone Claptrap</a>, Editorial, New York Times at A34, Dec. 13, 2011), the potential negative impact on aquifers could be life-threatening.  Most of the other provisions are Scrooge-like additions of hurdles and caps on social welfare provisions or attempts to roll back the social welfare insurance provisions into means-tested ones that will be even more susceptible to the derogatory and inflamatory class-action warfare that the right has increasingly unleashed on anything that doesn&#8217;t give a break to the wealthy and corporate clients of the all-powerful Washington lobbies. </p>
<p>On lobbies, just read the New York Times article about the wealth that online educators are getting from state and federal taxpayer dollars for delivering no or sub-standard education, and the amount of taxpayer money being spent on lobbying to ensure the continuous flow of that wealth.  See Saul, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/education/online-schools-score-better-on-wall-street-than-in-classrooms.html">Profits and Problems at Online Charter Schools</a>, New York Times, Dec. 12, 2011.  It&#8217;s obvious that the corporatist agenda sees no problem with siphoning off taxpayer dollars for private benefit with little public good created, but complains mightily about any siphoning off of exorbitant corporate profits&#8211;that tend to go to wasteful excess managerial compensation or portfolio enhancement&#8211;for taxes intended for public benefit.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the Keystone and other right-wing-rhetoric-driven items in a bill to provide the payroll tax cut and a limited unemployment extension (with hurdles) demonstrates the absurd level of ideological partisanship engaged in by the House Republicans.  Senate Majority Leader Reid characterized the bill as loaded with &#8220;ideological candy&#8221; that the Senate would reject.  Sloan &#038; Rubin, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/12/13/bloomberg_articlesLW5T8C6K50Z4.DTL">House to Vote on Payroll Bill as senate Eyes Tax Sweeteners</a>, Bloomberg.com (Dec. 13, 2011).    Of course, most of the sweeteners that Reid proposes adding are components of the right-wing corporate-friendly agenda&#8211;like the R&#038;D credit that rewards what companies do anyway; the active financing exception for big banks, insurers and other financial institutions that lets them defer taxation on their financing income earned overseas; and accelerated depreciation for restaurants and motorsports tracks that provide special tax subsidies to particular industries!</p>

                                <p>The number of newly reported drug shortages (mostly generic) has been growing:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were 74 newly reported drug shortages in 2005. </li>
<li>The number dipped slightly to 70 in 2006, then rose to 129 in 2007, 149 in 2008, 166 in 2009, and 211 in 2010. </li>
<li>In mid-2011 there were about 246 shortages. </li>
</ul>
<p>NPR had a special on this about a month ago, but increasing numbers of people in Boston area report inability to easily fill prescriptions is on the rise, and hospitals report shortages that affect their abilities to deliver services, even surgery.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last month, I published a post on the nonsense that is Black Friday sales (<a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/11/no-black-friday-sales-were-not-up-16-not-even-6/">No, Black Friday Sales Were Not Up 16% (not even 6%</a>). That evolved into a Washington Post article, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/did-black-friday-save-the-season-beware-the-retail-hype/2011/11/29/gIQAfNCUMO_story.html"><em>Did Black Friday save the season? Beware the retail hype</em></a>.</p>
<p>Today, we learn that many breathless forecasts from NRF to ShopperTrak were so much <strong>hot air </strong>and <strong>empty hype</strong>: Sales were flat to up only modestly. Total U.S. retail sales in November gained only 0.2%, following a 0.6% October. Even that month was revised downwards.</p>
<p><em>Retailers themselves may pay the price for their massive discounting</em>: Not only might their quarterly earnings be affected by the margin pressure, but they continually train investors shoppers to hunt for discounts. Retail therapy and sport shopping are being replaced by extreme couponing and sites like Living Social and Groupon.</p>

<p>In case you hadn&#8217;t heard about it, Gingrich would offer taxpayers a choice to pay tax under current policy or at a 15% rate, with zero taxation of capital gains, dividends and interest that accrues mostly to the rich and uberrich, while corporate tax rate would be reduced to a mere 12.5%.  For the rich, the 15% rate on their ordinary income and the 0% rate on their predominant form of income (capital gains and income from capital) would be a windfall.  For corporations, it would practically amount to the elimination of the corporate tax.  It should be no surprise that tax revenues would decline substantially: the <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=3252&#038;DocTypeID=2">Tax Policy Center study of Gingrich&#8217;s plan</a>estimates by $1.3 trillion over a decade.  While the lower two quintiles would get an average tax cut of about $440, the top 1% (starting at incomes of about $629,000) would get an average $344,000 cut and the top 0.1% (starting at incomes of about 2.868 million) an average $1.9 million cut.  Id. </p>

<p>Gingrich&#8217;s rationale is one that the right-wing American Enterprise Institute strongly supports&#8211;the tired old reaganomics rationale that eliminating taxes on capital will create new investments.  See, e.g., <a href="http://blog.american.com/2011/12/why-romney-is-wrong-and-gingrich-is-right-on-capital-gains-taxes/">Why Romney is Wrong and Gingrich is Right on Capital Gains Taxes</a>, AEI ( Dec. 12, 2011).  This theory is hogwash&#8211;lowering the return on investment by the piddling tax (whether 15% or 20%) will not keep folks from investing.  Folks will still make profits and they will still invest those profits, even if they have to pay taxes.  Paying no tax on dividends and capital gains won&#8217;t make the rich suddenly invest in entreprenuerial activities, my friends.  (Simply trading corporate stocks on the secondary market is not, by the way, entrepreneurial.)</p>
<p>The Gingrich website also objects that this plan is really good for everybody.</p>
<blockquote><p>An optional flat tax reform will be simple: Tax returns can be done on one sheet of paper,” the website says. “Subtract from income a standard deduction and deductions for charity and home ownership, multiply the result by the fixed, single rate of taxation of at most 15 percent, and the process is over.”  Wash. Post, above (quoting the website).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Folks, the hardest part of the income tax is figuring out whether you have income and how it is characterized (capital or ordinary).  Neither of those two difficulties disappears under Gingrich&#8217;s system.  Furthermore, ordinary fold really don&#8217;t have a very difficult time with their tax returns&#8211;they have wage income (withheld against), report the standard deduction and personal exemptions, and get a refund of part of the amount withheld.  The appeal to simplicity is a cover for the real purpose&#8211;to provide an unprecedented tax break to the wealthiest Americans at a time when the right is targeting Medicare and Social Security for cuts.  This is just one more example of class warfare from the right wing.</p>

                                <p>By <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a>  </p>
<p>EA Spreads: Why Should the Trend Change?
<p>They <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/10/world/europe/euro-zone-agrees-to-reinforce-maastricht-rules.html">changed the title</a>; but originally the NY Times reported “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/10/world/europe/euro-zone-agrees-to-reinforce-maastricht-rules.html">Euro Zone Agrees to Reinforce Maastricht Rules</a>“.  That’s exactly what EA policy makers agreed to last week – not much to bring home.</p>
<p>The real shift in policy came from the ECB. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8949723/Merkels-Teutonic-summit-enshrines-Hooverism-in-EU-treaty-law.html">Ambrose Evans-Pritchard </a>highlights the ECB’s actions as ensuring some sort of bank profitability, while at the same time defining the buyer of EA sovereign bonds. The banks will access funding from the ECB for up to 3 years at a very low and variable rate &#8211; currently the policy rate is 1% – and earn a higher return on their holdings of government debt (This morning, Italian 2-yr debt is trading at 6.05% – not bad). The banks will be ‘encouraged’ to buy government debt, thereby ensuring a funding source for the sovereigns. But this is not a business model, neither for the banks nor for the sovereigns.</p>
<p>Europe is headed toward recession – in fact, it’s probably already contracting – and EU policy makers agreed to explicitly enforce contractionary policy. Kevin O’Rourke calls it a <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/orourke1/English">Summit of Death</a>, while Paul Krugman argues the impossibility of the grand <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/10/lessons-from-europe/">internal devaluation</a> experiment. I call it economic oppression coupled with zombie bank deleveraging – it is absolutely not in Spain’s best interest to be pushing sharp fiscal contraction while the private sector is itself deleveraging.</p>
<p>But alas, they’ve decided to put off the only credible solution, fiscal union, for another time. I suspect that global investors are going to see right through this simple fact. External investors will grow tired of the zombie deleveraging and recession, of which more selling will cheapen bonds further. Regarding bond spreads, why should this Summit lead to any different outcome than the ones before it? It shouldn’t.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p>Until EA policy makers make a concerted step toward fiscal union, the bond crisis will continue to evolve just as it has at each crossroad in the past. The european sovereign crisis will deteriorate further.</p>

<p>The chart above illustrates the average 10yr spread of the 9 bond markets listed over a like German bund alongside each major announcement date (see table below) through December 9. The trend has been up while volatile. Furthermore, no announcement to date has successfully stemmed the upward bias in bond spreads. EA policy makers consistently avoid the only truly credible answer: fiscal union.</p>

<p>American v. Brazilian Healthcare, a Continuing Series</p>
<p>I spoke to my sister on Skype last night.  She&#8217;s been in Natal, in Northeastern Brazil, for the past few months.   Last week, she noticed a couple small warts growing on her leg.  So she wandered down to a government run hospital and and had them removed.  The hospital was low on supplies, and the doctor asked her to contribute a box of Q-tips (since Q-tips would be needed in the procedure).  The total cost of the whole thing:  12 reais, or about $6.60 American, plus a box of Q-tips.  </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve had a post that dealt with my sister and the Brazilian health care system.  A few years ago I wrote about the time she had <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/american-medical-system-one-persons.html">emergency open heart surgery</a> in Brazil, and how it compared very favorably with her experience with (planned) open heart surgery in the US.  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Now, on the subject of the US, my wife also has an interesting healthcare story to relate.  She got a letter from Aetna, her insurance provider, indicating they didn&#8217;t know why they were being asked to pay for services when she doesn&#8217;t have health insurance through them.  Interestingly enough, money is withdrawn from our bank account each month to pay for her health insurance, and a call to Aetna indicated that she did, in fact, have health insurance.  A number of phone calls back and forth between my wife, Aetna, and her doctor resolved the issue (I think) &#8211; the doctor is being paid, etc.  But it isn&#8217;t the first time this has happened, and it serves to follow up our family&#8217;s <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/health-insurance-american-style.html">earlier experience with health insurance</a>.  All told, I would estimate my wife and I have spent about 40 hours &#8211; that would be a workweek &#8211; dealing with health insurance since July.  </p>
<p>Brazil is a poor country, and I don&#8217;t think anyone has ever suggested that the Brazilian health system is the best in the world.  On the other hand, we often hear precisely that about the American system from certain circles, despite the astounding cost (which doesn&#8217;t seem to include the waste of time dealing with the paperwork or fighting with health insurance companies) and ho-hum outcomes.  I&#8217;m starting to think a lot of Americans are absolutely insane.  Lord knows it would explain a lot.</p>

                                <p><em><strong>Note</strong></em>: I wasn’t going to post this, but after all the flack Willard Romney is receiving about offering to bet his fellow millionaires $10,000, I find myself in the unusual position of being sympathetic to him.  Therefore, the story of the day in early November of 1992 on which I offered to bet $10,000:  </p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://blog.nj.com/njv_paul_mulshine/2011/12/hey_mitt_stop_explaining_and_s.html">Paul Mulshine</a> (h/t <a href="http://www.bluejersey.com/diary/19988/news-roundup-open-thread-for-wednesday-dec-14-2011">Blue Jersey</a>) claims that had Perry taken the bet—that is, had the courage of his convictions—he would &#8220;have awarded him the 10 grand.&#8221;*****  Instead, Perry claimed he&#8217;s &#8220;not a betting man,&#8221; all evidence contrariwise (e.g., his continuing this campaign) notwithstanding. Instead, the multimillionaire <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2011/12/12/perry-i-dont-have-10k-to-bet/">lied</a>.  Good thing he&#8217;s not running on character.</p>
<p>I am, truth to be told, probably a lousy poker player.  Not so bad as Barack Obama, but—aside from tells—when I see a sucker, I don’t hesitate.</p>
<p>So, a while back, when <a href="http://lancemannion.com/" target="_blank">Lance Mannion</a> (of <a href="http://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/2011/08/this-just-in-lance-mannion-is-still-wrong.html" target="_blank">Lance Mannion is Still Wrong</a> fame) started tweeting about how Obama’s recent activities meant that liberals <a href="https://twitter.com/LanceMannion/status/98226972043386881" target="_blank">need to double-down and work to get large Democratic majorities for Obama in 2013</a>. Since that worked so well in 2009-2010, I went looking for an opening.  And <a href="https://twitter.com/LanceMannion/status/98233798591909888" target="_blank">found one</a>:</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>
<p>Really, Boehner almost lost his Speakership over this, he may yet, and he sounds like he won the World Series &#8211; <a href="http://goo.gl/di359">http://goo.gl/di359</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>which required <a href="http://twitter.com/klhoughton/status/98378507482185728" target="_blank">an appropriate, calm, measured reply</a>*:</p>
<blockquote><p>@<a href="http://twitter.com/LanceMannion">LanceMannion</a> Really, Obama lost his Presidency over this, and he sounds as if he&#8217;s cruising toward multimillion dollar CofC [Chamber of Commerce] speaking fees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which produced <a href="https://twitter.com/LanceMannion/status/98396584416509952" target="_blank">the bet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/klhoughton">klhoughton</a> Dinner says he&#8217;s re-elected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which lead to a discussion of betting on Presidential elections, which I admitted <a href="https://twitter.com/klhoughton/status/98417826490097667" target="_blank">I only did once before</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>K: I did bet $10K that WJC would win. But that was the day of the election. Now, my biggest risk is that Romney beats Bachmann.</p>
<p>L: You bet HOW MUCH?????</p>
<p>K: $10,000. (Trade was vetoed by my boss. Long story. Still bitter.) Other side was someone who is prominent [and from what I can tell a major source] in [William D. Cohan’s] <em>House of Cards</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bitter story below the fold.</p>
<p>It’s Election Day, 1992.  I am (somewhat) young, single, paying about $600/month in rent, and making Real Money for the first time in a year or so. (Ask your grandfather about the recession of 1990-1991.) In short, I am not liquidity-constrained.</p>
<p>Alan “Ace” Greenberg—the last CEO of Bear Stearns who was worth paying—had endorsed William Jefferson Clinton several months previously. He was the first head of a Wall Street firm to do so, but not the last.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, George H. W. Bush has been going around the country for the past week, campaigning as if he doesn’t want to win.  Or at least that’s the way it sounded to me, and I suspect the majority of the American people. It’s long after the Supermarket Scanner incident,** but he has spent the past two days yelling—calling Al Gore “Ozone Man” in Detroit—and generally Not Being Serious. For a candidate whose major strength is that he is Serious, it was clear that he was expecting to lose.</p>
<p>When the candidate expects to lose, it’s not a bad idea to bet against him. His information is likely better than yours, and his “tell” is showing.</p>
<p>So when one of the salespeople, who had a rather short temper, was pontificating at the end of the day about how GHWB was going to win that evening, I offered a friendly wager. At least, it started out that way.  But this is Wall Street.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ken: “Bet you $10 Clinton wins.” As I said, trying to keep it a friendly wager. We would spend more than $10 on lunch (which was a company expense anyway).</p>
<p>Salesman (irritated at being challenged): “Make it $100.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, when the mark says, “Take my money!” it’s at least a venial sin not to do so.  But if we’re going to talk about real money…</p>
<blockquote><p>Ken:  “Make it $1,000.”</p>
<p>Salesman (getting angrier): “If you’re that certain, make it $10,000.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point I hesitate. Not for effect, but just to do the calculations.  I know I have about $20,000 in liquid assets*** at the time, so another order of magnitude is out of the question.****  Can I afford to lose A Sure Thing?  Absolutely.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ken: “Done.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, my boss—who had met the soon-to-be-former President and still thought fondly of him—intervened. (It is left as an exercise whether he made it up to me in bonus.)</p>
<p>So when millionaire Willard “Mitt” Romney offers to bet $10,000 with <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/08/30/rick_perry_rich/" target="_blank">millionaire Rick Perry</a> or <a href="http://wonkette.com/457137/newt-gingrich-a-mega-millionaire-sam-brownback-still-cant-get-any-respect-from-teen-twitterer" target="_blank">millionaire Newt Gingrich</a>, he’s basically fitting the minimum criterion for “this should get your attention.”  It’s hardly an “all-in”bet; as Hendrik Hertzberg notes, it’s more a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/hendrikhertzberg/2011/12/gingrich-romney-debate.html" target="_blank">casual wager</a>.</p>
<p>As Francis Scott Key’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald" target="_blank">descendant</a> once noted, “The rich are different.” And Papa’s rejoinder, “Yes, they have more money” is especially relevant when judging how sincerely the person believes their position to be correct.</p>
<p>Mitt’s offer to his fellow multimillionaires isn’t notable for its size; what is notable is that—as with me nineteen years ago—neither Gingrich nor Perry was willing to call and raise him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*Those who have read my last two posts will realize that I say this without the slightest hint of irony, and that your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>**I’m sympathetic to GHWB on that one, by the way.  I lived and shopped in Washington Heights at the time, so we didn’t have scanners in any of our supermarkets either.  No one managing those stores would even think about making that type of capital investment.  And I shopped in stores a lot more often than the President—or even the Vice President—of the United States ever would. Those being the two jobs GHWB had had since 1981, the odds of him having encountered a supermarket scanner are about the same as [pick famous actress not related to my neighbor’s husband or filming one of her novels] showing up on my front door.</p>
<p>***I may have been counting Lines of Credit as part of liquid assets.</p>
<p>****I’m certain, in retrospect, that he would have said “done” on $100K. And given that I would have estimated the probability of losing at less than 10%, economic theory says that I should have offered the higher amount, even knowing I couldn’t cover it.  I believe this is the theory recently used by MF Global, who were dealing on direct-from-Mario-Draghi information.</p>
<p>*****The AP <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/ap_factcheck_misstatements_abo.html">disagrees</a>, but I find myself agreeing with Mulshine—a strange feeling in itself.</p>

<blockquote><p>In its top of the hour news segment NPR reported that President Obama hoped that voters would give him credit for avoiding a second Great Depression. If this is an accurate representation of what President Obama said then it should have devoted a segment to economists&#8230;for trying to set an unbelievably low bar for measuring the success of his economic policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The post has no elaboration itself, but readers are knowledgeable.  This is more like a topical thread&#8230;and of course relates to message and campaigns of the candidates.  But the Republican candidates have their own set of rhetorics.</p>
