                                <p>by <strong>Linda Beale</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/"><strong>Illinois&#8217; deficit reduction scheme </strong></a> <br />crossposted with <strong>Ataxingmatter</strong>
<p>States have generally suffered during this economic crisis much the way most people have&#8211;there&#8217;s been less money coming in as sales receipts slowed during the recession, more services needed as many become homeless, insuranceless and generally more vulnerable during the recession, and bills have continued to pile up (including for mundane things like utilities and print jobs and more long-term commitments like pension promises made to state employees to secure competent workers often at lower-than-market wages for those competencies).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p>States have a number of options for dealing with the demands.  They can layoff employees and freeze salary increases, taking the brunt of the recession out of the hide of state services and state employees and at the same time likely making the recession worse as the state is unable to provide the kinds of assistance to its most vulnerable populations that it otherwise would have been able to do.  They can utilize accounting gimmicks to delay a few bills and accelerate a few revenue items, making this year look better at the cost of next year.  They can use reserve funds that they&#8217;ve set aside for a rainy day, though when such funds are used for basic operating expenses, it guarantees that a truly rainy day will come and there will be no funds to meet the unexpected needs.  Or they can raise taxes&#8211;either sales taxes, which will fall primarily on the most vulnerable, since consumption taxes are a kind of flat, across-the-board tax that is regressive since the poor spend all of their income (and pay taxes on all of it) while the rich spend a small share of their income (and hence pay minimal taxes in proportion to their ability to pay).</p>
<p>Some states have dealt with the problem with the perennial accounting gimmickry.  All  that does is paper over the problem and pass it along to the next budget year.  That&#8217;s what Schwartzeneggar did in part in California, meaning that Jerry Brown has a huge budget gap to face that will require a mix of cuts and tax increases.  Treating accounting gimmicks as a real solution is sort of like George W. Bush saying that the $1.3 Trillion of tax revenue losses created by his 2001 tax cut bill  wouldn&#8217;t really ever materialize, because of the &#8220;laffer effect&#8221; that tax cuts would be so conducive to economic growth that the government would actually get as much revenue as before or even more! Laugable, of course, since any serious economist will tell you that tax cuts do not pay for themselves.  Even more laughable now after the experience of the 8 years of the Bush regime when a new tax cut bill passed every year and we had at best an anemic job creation record  and no sharing of productivity gains with workers.  Tax cuts that just leave more money in the pockets of overly compensated managers and already wealthy shareholders do just about nothing towards creating jobs.  Mainly that give more money to people that already have a lot of it, and those people are more likely to put it in emerging economies or some other kind of vehicle that does nothing to support entrepreneurship or create jobs here in the USA.</p>
<p>Some states seem to be dealing with the fiscal crises by cutting workers pay and cutting workers.  That is likely merely to make the crisis worse over the long run.  It increases unemployment&#8211;thrusting a number of former public employees on the dole.  It leaves businesses facing less purchasing power&#8211;especially in and around the state capitol.  It creates an atmosphere of austerity which breeds its own consumer pessimism that feeds negatively into the recession cycle.  It leaves state services shorthanded, with a likely result that accidents and crimes will increase (as state parks and large public events are understaffed), and other indicators of a good quality of life will go down (long lines at the department that issues drivers&#8217; licenses, etc.).</p>
<p>So that leaves thinking about tax increases.  Even those who think state taxes should increase&#8211;especially in ways that make them more progressive (think Michigan&#8211;where a very low income tax rate that is constitutionally capped means that the wealthy benefit hugely from the state&#8217;s expenditures but pay very little in taxes)&#8211;may hesitate to recommend large tax hikes during recessions, in part because of the psychological impact of a tax hike, on top of all the other &#8220;bad&#8221; economic news.  If people have a choice, they might just move to a state that doesn&#8217;t have such a tax hike.  And since tax increases are most likely to impact people with higher incomes who have a choice, it is possible (though certainly not inevitable) that a tax increase on higher incomes will lead to some exodus from the state of those high income earners who are mobile.  But there are reasons that a tax increase might make the most sense out of the various unpleasant options.  The fears about exodus are probably exaggerated&#8211;people have any number of reasons for choosing where to live, and a business that has established ties (customers, vendors, workers) cannot so easily just move lock stock and barrel to another state.  Tax money in state coffers will be spent as it comes in&#8211;it really isn&#8217;t taking that money out of the economy, but just reallocating it to preferential uses.  To the extent that the money is used to support vulnerable populations who would otherwise create a burden on local and state government anyway, it is clearly a win-win proposition.  And of course if the state funds are used in ways that encourage business startups or new types of businesses to move to the state (and use supplies, hire workers, etc.), the state expenditures will give greater bang for the buck than leaving them in the hands of weathier state residents who would have invested them abroad.  When tax increases permit a state to satisfy the various obligations it has entered into, that fosters a climate of business certainty and trust&#8211;state employees know that the contract they have entered will be honored, businesses in the state agree to contract with the state because they will be paid, and the state and its municipalities can successfully borrow in the muni market to meet those capital expansion needs that require longer term financing.</p>
<p>All in all, it seems that reasonable tax increases should be a win-win proposition, even during difficult economic times.  What is reasonable?  A tax increase that will be paid by people and businesses that can afford it and that will be used to support worthy state endeavors.</p>
<p>At any rate, that is the decision that Illinois Democrats reached today, as an income tax increase &#8220;squeaked through&#8221; the Illinois House (60-57 vote Tuesday) and Senate (30-29 vote Wednesday) before the new legislative session began this afternoon.  See Karen Pierog, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1217617620110112">Illinois Lawmakers Pass Big Tax Hike to Aid Budget</a>, Reuters, Jan 12, 2011.  The bill temporarily increases the individual and corporate income tax rates, and sets a spending limit through fiscal 2015.    For a description of the proposal put together by the Governor and Speaker and Senate President, whichapparently had stiffer rate increases and other provisions than the bill actually passed last night (which is not yet available on the Illinois website), see <a href="http://www.iassw.org/legislative.htm">here</a> (Phil Milsk legislative update on January 7 for Illinois Association of School Social Workers).</p>

                                <p>As the title indicates, this will be a more than usually confused post.<br />The stimulus was the now famous grief over elementary fairness which errupted when <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/business/11lawyers.html?_r=2&#038;hp">&#8220;[Judge] Scott Fairgrieve of Nassau County District Court, wrote that &#8216;swearing to false statements reflects poorly on the profession [of law] as a whole&#8221;</a> and fined lawyer Steven J Baum $20,000 for false statements in support of a foreclosure.  Baum also suffered a Schack attack when Judge Arthur M. Schack referred to one filing as “incredible, outrageous, ludicrous and disingenuous.” </p>
<p>Baum wrote &#8220;Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Toto not a good time to be a sleazy lawyer in New York (when was the last time that was true?).</p>
<p>The part which stunned me was <br />
<blockquote>Anne Reynolds Copps, the chairwoman of the real property law section of the New York State bar, said, “We had a lot of concerns, because it seemed to paint attorneys as being the problem.” Lawyers feared they would be responsible for a bank’s mistakes. “They are relying on a client, or the client’s employees, to provide the information on which they are basing the documents,” she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>So her view is that lawyers do not have the responsibility to check the claims of fact they make to judges, to look at the evidence.  So what exactly do they do?  Is the claim that their job is to look good in a suit and speak proper English with a confident tone?</p>
<p>Lawyers have discovered that they can make a whole lot more money by not doing their jobs and claiming they have done their jobs.  Big surprise.  Now the idea that they might have to give up that income, because they don&#8217;t have time to do what they have been claiming they have been doing is shocking.</p>
<p>I think that this is a very general phenomenon.   </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how much money Baum made, but it is clear that one lawyer with a huge income must have been mainly taking money for doing what he didn&#8217;t bother to do </p>
<p>&#8220;David J. Stern, a lawyer whose Florida firm has been part of an estimated 20 percent of the foreclosure actions in the state, has been accused of filing sloppy and even fraudulent mortgage paperwork.&#8221;  One firm [working on] 20% of the foreclosures, how many partners? How many associates with law degrees?  How many robo signers?</p>
<p>Bankers and lawyers used to earn good money for, among other things, due diligence, keeping records, keeping proof if the records were contested, and complying with burdensome laws and regulations.  </p>
<p>Relatively recently, they have earned immense incomes claiming they had done those things without bothering to do them.  I guess that the fee charged by the lawyers who didn&#8217;t glance at the evidence is the same as the fees charged by lawyers who check if something is true before telling it to a judge.  Clearly, one can make a lot of money claiming to have done something difficult and time consuming without bothering to do it.</p>
<p>Banks charge fees for handling transactions, but clearly stopped bothering to, say, handle transfer of a mortgage in a way that the entity which paid them could foreclose when the time came. </p>
<p>Banks charge to exchange currencies.  If they are trading pieces of paper for pieces of paper, then they have to hold money to do that and they have to keep people from stealing it.  If I am taking money out of an ATM in a country with a different currency from my bank account, I am forcing some computer somewhere to multiply two numbers.  Ouch.  But they charge as if they were doing it with pen and paper (or maybe an abacus).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d guess that most of the huge profits of the financial services sector are based on separating gamblers from their money, but a large part come from charging for services not rendered and another large part come from charging a lot for services which cost very little to provide now that they have computers.</p>
<p>The terror at the idea that judges won&#8217;t accept &#8220;because I say so&#8221; as proof shows how much the system depends on no one checking what was actually done in exchange for the huge flow of fees.</p>

                                <p>One of the best rules in mathematics is that, to determine the value of all the variables, you need only as many distinct equations as you have variables. (previous sentence edited for clarity.) So let&#8217;s combine a couple of recent articles (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/01/links-for-2011-01-10.html">Mark Thoma</a> for the first, <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/balancing-budget.html">Digby</a> for the second.)</p>
<p>Richard Florida <a href="http://real-estate-and-urban.blogspot.com/2011/01/some-evidence-about-state-government.html">finds three studies of State Government Spending Multipliers</a>. The three studies find multipliers of 1.5, 1.7, and 2.12. Let&#8217;s be nice (in context) and use the lower one. StateMultiplier = 1.5</p>
<p>David Dayden notes that <a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2011/01/10/crushing-state-budget-cuts-wiping-out-stimulative-effects-of-tax-deal/">budget cuts in just two (large) states can be matched against the Fed&#8217;s &#8220;stimulus&#8221; monies</a>. Let&#8217;s see how much, putting the best face possible on the data (i.e., taking the most optimistic projections). CADeficit (ignoring &#8220;reserve&#8221;): $26.4B (12.5 + 12 + 1.9). ILDeficit: $19B (13 + 6).</p>
<p>That gives us a CA-ILEconomyCost of (26.4 + 19)*1.5 = US$68.1B</p>
<p>The Federal Stimulus is $55-60B. Again, let&#8217;s be optimists and say $60B. The required multiplier is then:</p>
<p>FedMultiplier * FedStim = CA-ILEconomyCost</p>
<p>FedMultiplier * $60B = $68.1B</p>
<p>FedMultiplier = 1.135</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the minimum multiplier needed just to counter those two states. Add in <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/texas-taxes/2011-budget-shortfall/">Texas</a> (whose shortfall appears to be on par with California&#8217;s, and is larger than Illinois)and you&#8217;re at 1.77.</p>
<p>Only 47 states to go.</p>
<p>The maximum multiplier needed just to solve the CA-IL gap is 1.71. Add in TX and you&#8217;re at 2.63 with 47 states to go.</p>
<p>The Right-Leaning Econ Bloggers (e.g., Tyler Cowen and Greg Mankiw; I apologize to the former for linking him to the latter) argued in 2008-2009 that Federal Stimulus has a multiplier of 1.3 or less.*</p>
<p>1.3 would put the economy at neutral if the multiplier is 1.7 (median estimate) and most but not all of the CA ambiguities break the wrong way.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just eliminating the effect of those two states. Add in TX and the multiplier goes to 2.64—rather close to Christina Romer&#8217;s 3.0 that was attacked continually by Mankiw et al.</p>
<p>Repeat after me: There was No &#8220;Second Stimulus.&#8221; If the economy is going to go into full recovery—i.e., can I have jobs with that?—it will have to be from Private Sector Investment, which has been (let&#8217;s be nice) on the sidelines so far,* and really doesn&#8217;t appear to be warming up to replace TARP.</p>
<p>*Strangely, this was not argued by them as an argument that the initial &#8220;stimulus&#8221; was too small for the even-then-obvious shortfalls in C and I; I can&#8217;t believe they thought MX was going to cover the difference, but that&#8217;s a side discussion, perhaps.</p>
<p>*We can quibble over whether that was and remains the correct decision. As has often been noted here, a lack of demand is not exactly an incentive to expand, unless you think that will be changing soon. A true recovery should have convinced firms that a change is gonna come.</p>

                                <p>Even though Europe is on the forefront of global bond news these days, I&#8217;d like to revisit the US Treasury market. Specifically, I&#8217;ll look at the Canadian-US bond spreads, which tell an interesting tale of Fed purchases and US deficit fears.</p>
<p>First, the Canadian over US government bond spreads for two longer term issues, 10yr and 30yr in chart below, have been falling for some time. Today (Jan. 10, 2011), the 10-yr Canadian Treasury over the 10-yr Treasury spread is around -12 basis points (bps), i.e., the Canadian 10-yr bond is 12 bps lower than the US 10-yr. The 30-yr spread is roughly -86 bps.</p>
<p>The recent divergence of the &#8216;spread&#8217; between these two spreads presents a bit of a conundrum, since the two have more or less moved in lockstep.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TSt5WxixsqI/AAAAAAAADbg/nWHhspYY0ms/s1600/spreads_chart.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TSt5WxixsqI/AAAAAAAADbg/nWHhspYY0ms/s400/spreads_chart.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><em>Note: in the chart above, each dotted line represents the period average for the 30 calendar day (30-c.day) moving average spread of similar color.</em></p>
<p>The conundrum is this: the 30-yr spread has deviated well below its 2002-2011 average of 8 bps, while the 10-yr spread is sitting roughly at its average, -13 bps. But this is not a conundrum if you consider recent US policy, holding all else equal.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>One the one hand, the Federal Reserve is concentrating its bond purchases in the long end of the curve, primarily below the 10-yr maturity. <a href="http://www.ny.frb.org/markets/lttreas_faq.html">According to the NY Fed</a>, 23% of the $600 bn will be allocated to the 7yr-10yr part of the curve, while just 4% will support the 17yr-30yr end. Therefore, and holding all else equal, the CAN-US spread proxies somewhat the effects of Fed policy in the bond market. The Fed is supporting the 10-yr spread roughly at trend(Section II in chart above), while contemporaneously raising inflation expectations relative to that in Canada.</p>
<p>On the other hand, without Fed support the 30-yr spread is pricing in not only rising inflation expectations but also an increasing US sovereign risk premium relative to that in Canada. This is a similar premium that was attached to Canadian sovereign debt in the early- to mid- 1990s (Section I in the chart above).</p>
<p>Compare the chart below, which illustrates the annual federal deficit in the two countries as a percentage of GDP, to the chart above. Notice how when the red line, (Canadian government deficit) moves aboe the blue line (US government deficit), the average spread drops (Section III in first chart)? That premium is now feeding into the 30-yr spread at an increasing rate (Section II of first chart).</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TSs2NCyHE0I/AAAAAAAADbA/tb-fOfChgio/s1600/deficit_chart.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TSs2NCyHE0I/AAAAAAAADbA/tb-fOfChgio/s400/deficit_chart.JPG" border="0"></a>I am in no way suggesting that the US should undergo a similar fiscal austertiy program as that taken in Canada in 1995 (please see <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2010/10/canadas-budget-triumph.html">Stephen Gordon at Worthwhile Canadian Initiative</a>). What I am demonstrating, though &#8211; and rather qualitatively, I might add &#8211; is that absent active Fed purchases in the back end of the curve, there is a risk premium emerging in the US bond market relative to that of at least one country with markedly lower government deficits, all else equal, of course.</p>

<p>It can happen, in fact, because conservatives so thoughtlessly and readily use violent eliminationist rhetoric when talking about &#8220;liberals&#8221; (to wit: anyone who is not a conservative). They will adamantly deny it, of course, but the cold reality is that this kind of talk creates permission for angry and violent people to act it out.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The Tax Rate that Maximizes Economic Growth, Part 3… With Gov&#8217;t Spending, Money Supply and Demographics</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=29">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>Today I will build a model that explains over three quarters of the annual movement in real GDP between 1929 and the present.  The model depends on marginal tax rates, government spending, the Fed, and demographic trends.  This post isn’t light reading and will demand a bit of attention, but I’m going to try to make it worth your while.  Let’s just say there’s a lot here that contradicts what you’ll read in your standard economics textbook.</p>
<p>This post continues the “Kimel curve” theme I’ve been following for the past few weeks, namely that there is a top that maximizes the growth of real GDP.  That is relatively easy to find: run a regression with growth in real GDP as the dependent variable, and the top marginal income tax rate and the top marginal income tax rate squared as explanatory variables.  (If you haven’t seen any posts in this series, or aren’t familiar with regression analysis, you might want to take a look <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=268">the first post in the series </a>.)  Official and relatively reliable data for GDP is available going back to 1929.  The growth maximizing top marginal tax rate according to that simple model is in the neighborhood of 65%.  </p>
<p>This week I’d like to add a few other variables that I think might affect growth.  The first is government spending; for a long time there has been a debate in this country about whether government spending can boost the economy. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Another variable I want to add is the Fed’s behavior.  If you’ve read <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">Presimetrics</a>, the book I wrote with Michael Kanell, you know this is a variable I think has a huge effect on the economy, and not quite in the way textbooks tell you.  So I’m going to add two variables, both of which are dummies.  As I’ve noted in a couple posts, a dummy variable takes a value of one or zero, which also amounts to a “yes” or a “no.”  The first of these Fed behavior dummy variables tells us whether the real money supply increased a lot.  I’m defining that as a situation when the median 3 month change in real M1 throughout the year exceeded 1%.  (Real M1, obviously, being just M1 adjusted for inflation.)  The second Fed behavior dummy variable looks at whether there’s a big drop in the real money supply; that is, the variable is true when the median 3 month change in real M1 was a decrease of greater than 0.5%.   Why the asymmetry between big increases (over 1%) and big decreases (over 0.5%)?  Simple –the money supply should grow over time if only to keep up with population increases.</p>
<p>Moving on… the model contains two demographic variables.  One is the percentage of the population between 35 and 54 years of age.  That is to say, the proportion of people in more or less their prime earning years.  (I imagine prime earning years was closer to 35 in 1929, and has moved closer to 54 today as manual labor has become a less important piece of the economy.)  I’m also including the percentage of the population that is above 70 years of age; on average, most people in that demographic are not active in the work force.  </p>
<p>Finally, I’ve included one more dummy variable for the 1929 to 1932 period.  I’m not ready to explain that collapse yet, so I’ve included this variable if only to indicate that there is something different about those years than other years for which we have data.</p>
<p>So here’s what we get when we run a regression in Excel.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TSp8PGDqiFI/AAAAAAAAAgc/PN2u_imv4G4/s1600/Figure_11.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TSp8PGDqiFI/AAAAAAAAAgc/PN2u_imv4G4/s400/Figure_11.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>To interpret…  the adjusted R2 (light blue) tells us that the model explains about 76% of the variation in the growth in real GDP.  (If you’re interested – I did some residual analysis and the usual batch of things to be worried about come up with nothing.  E.g., the correlation between et and et+1 = 0.04.)  </p>
<p>Tax rates and tax rates squared are significant (green cells).  We get the same curve that has showed up in previous posts on this topic, but in this instance, the fastest real GDP growth occurs when the top marginal tax rate is 59%.  A bit lower than the 65% figure from earlier models, but close enough… and pretty far away from what most economists and politicians and talk show hosts will tell you.  Like it’s a surprise such folks are wrong.</p>
<p>And on the topic of those folks being wrong… government spending is significant, contributes to growth, and does so at an increasingly faster rate as government spending increases.  (Burnt orange.)  On the other hand, it doesn’t necessarily pay for itself.  In future posts I’d like to split out government spending, as I have a feeling different forms of government spending have different effects.  </p>
<p>What about the Fed?  Well, it turns out the economy grows faster when the Fed increases the money supply quickly, and grows more slowly when the Fed decreases the money supply.  Not a surprise if you read my book, but…  you may recall your econ courses that taught you the Fed is supposed to try to boost the economy when it is in the doldrums, and slow the economy when its growing too quickly.  If the Fed really behaved that way, big increases in real M1 would be accompanied by slow economic growth, and big decreases in real M1 would be accompanied by fast economic growth.  This is yet another indication of something I’ve pointed out many times before – historically, either the folks on the Fed’s board don’t know what they’re doing, or they’re doing something different than most economists believe they’re doing.  Since they’re political appointees, I’d bet on both.  </p>
<p>1929 – 1932 is negative and significant.  No surprise.</p>
<p>Demographics – the prime earning demographic is positive and significant.  The more people in that demographic, the faster the economy grows.  No surprise, but a big negative – that demographic hit a peak in 2001.  It drifted down very slowly since, but its not going up any more.  The elderly contingent, on the other hand, is not significant.  </p>
<p>OK.  So…  the idea that if we want to maximize economic growth, the top marginal rate is somewhere well north of what most people believe seems to survive over a number of different posts.  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=261">Here&#8217;s one reason why.</a>  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=256">Here&#8217;s another.</a>  I’ll have a few more posts on the topic – this little exercise keeps raising more and more questions in my mind.</p>
<p>But a question – are these posts getting too complicated for a blog?  More graphs?  Comments?</p>

<p>M1 comes from a number of different sources.  M1 from prior to 1947 is available biannually (June and December) from documents in the FRASER collection of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  Specifically, data from prior to 1946 came from <a href="http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publications/bms/page/282/61/download/282.pdf">here</a>, and data from 1941 to 1947 came from <a href="http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publications/bms2/issue/60/download/102/section1.pdf">here</a>.  The data was “monthleycized” using a simple linear transformation.  FRASER also contains monthly data from 1947 to 1958 <a href="http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publications/bms2/issue/60/download/102/section1.pdf">in this document </a>.  Finally, another St. Louis Fed database, FRED, contains <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M1NS">monthly M1 from 1959 to the present</a>.  </p>
<p>Inflation adjustments were computed using monthly and yearly <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI-U</a> figures from the BLS.</p>
<p>Population figures were obtained (and organized painstakingly) from various Census sources:  <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/pre-1980/PE-11.html">pre-1980s</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/1980s/">1980s</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/1990s/">1990s</a>, and <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/2000s/">2000s</a>.  (I’m certain there was an easier way…)</p>
<p>As always, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them.  Drop me a line at my first name, period my last name, at gmail period com.  And note my first name in the e-mail address is mike.  An “m” gets you someone else whose patience is starting wear thin.  Also, on the subject of “m”s – my last name has only one.  Because a lot of people have been asking for my spreadsheets as of late, to make things easier please tell me the the name of this post, the date it appeared, and where it appeared.  </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I am sick today and had to cancel plans with a friend tonight. I decided to look at Eurozone unemployment rates to pass the miserable time.</p>
<p>According to the Friday <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-07012011-AP/EN/3-07012011-AP-EN.PDF">Eurostat press release</a>,<br />
<blockquote>The euro area1 (EA16) seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 10.1% in November 2010, unchanged compared with October4. It was 9.9% in November 2009. The EU271 unemployment rate was 9.6% in November 2010, unchanged compared with October4. It was 9.4% in November 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Eurozone started growing again in Q3 2009. But since then, the regional labor forces show a sharp divergence in resource utilization, as measured by the unemployment rates: the weak (Periphery) from the strong (core).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it looked in 2007 before the Eurozone entered recession.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TSjhLdmckcI/AAAAAAAADao/Ch7dQShfMe8/s1600/decouple_1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TSjhLdmckcI/AAAAAAAADao/Ch7dQShfMe8/s400/decouple_1.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The 2007 unemployment rates were quite similar in levels, where the differences in unemployment rates across the Eurozone are defined primarily by structural, rather than cyclical, factors.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it looks now, where the weakness in resource utilization due to cyclical factors is hitting the Periphery hard compared to the core countries, especially Germany.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TSjhLsGTulI/AAAAAAAADaw/_LI81T7Kcpg/s1600/decouple_2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TSjhLsGTulI/AAAAAAAADaw/_LI81T7Kcpg/s400/decouple_2.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><a name="more"></a>The chart above illustrates the change in the unemployment rate over the last two years using the September-November 3-month average for comparison. The countries are ranked from largest to smallest percentage increase in the unemployment rate over the two periods.</p>
<p>All of the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain) have seen their unemployment rates rise by 57% (Spain) or more (+82% for Ireland). To the right of the Euro Area average, you have Germany and Luxembourg seeing their unemployment rates decline over the same period.</p>
<p>The divergence in labor force deterioration across the Eurozone since 2007 is quite striking.</p>
