<p><strong>More on Illinois&#8217; income tax increase &#8211;thinking about globalization</strong><br />crossposted with <a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/"><strong>Ataxingmatter</strong></a>
<p>As states continue to face difficult times and vulnerable residents unemployed by the Great Recession come to the end of their ropes with the last of their unemployment support checks (those unemployed for 99 weeks don&#8217;t get any more help under the latest extension), the rhetoric continues to escalate.</p>
<p>As I noted in my last post on Illinois&#8217; decision to increase its personal and corporate income tax rates (See Illinois <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/96/PDF/096-1496.pdf">Senate Bill 2505</a>, signed into law by Gov. Quinn on Jan. 13), tax increases&#8211;especially those that require people and companies of wealth and power to kick in a fairer share of the tax burden&#8211;may well make sense even as the country deals with the continuing fallout of the banksters&#8217;s binge of casino speculation.  Governor Quinn noted when signing the Illinois legislation that the tax increase was need to stave off fiscal insolvency.   The 5% individual income tax rate applies until January 2015, at which time the rate reverts to 3.75% for ten years and then 3.25% after 2025.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p>The right wing&#8217;s preferred solution&#8211; to see the states fire public employees or at the least reneg on their earlier commitments to fund pensions (which generally permitted them to hire highly skilled employees at lower wages than would otherwise have been possible)&#8211; would only make grave matters much worse. There are important programs to be funded in the states, and ultimately a higher tax burden that is allocated to those who can best pay it may be the best solution.  Management efficiencies need to be undertaken, and wasteful spending and corruption stifled, but in many cases those savings are relatively small.  The &#8220;no new taxes&#8221; mantra that has dominated public discourse under the Chicago School thinking has kept states from dealing forthrightly with these issues for decades.</p>
<p>Wisconsin&#8217;s new governor, right-winger Scott Walker, is a perfect illustration of the zany rhetoric and gamesmanship being played about tax matters all across this country.  He has said he would spurn federal stimulus money and ditch a planned high-speed rail line between Madison and Milwaulkee.  See James warren, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/us/16cncwarren.html">Wisconsin Sounds Off, but Misses the Point</a>, New York Times, Jan 15, 2011.  High speed rail is the wave of the future, and the US needs to catch that wave soon or be left behind.   Walker&#8217;s rhetoric here seems designed to please wealth and power (and the kooks in the &#8220;tea party&#8221; who are foolish enough to think that federal monies for infrastructure is a waste of &#8220;their&#8221; tax money), but move the state in the opposite direction from where it needs to go.  Walker has also gone on the air in a campaign intended to take advantage of corporate dislike of the Illinois tax hike, inviting corporations to &#8220;escape to Wisconsin.&#8221;</p>
<p>James Warren&#8217;s piece in the Friday New York Times challenges that sentiment.  Seems that the Illinois personal rate (5%) is probably less than taxation under the progressive scale of 4.6% to 7.75% in Wisconsin.  And if Caterpillar or some other big corporation were to move to Wisconsin, it would face a higher rate of 7.9% compared to the 7% rate passed for Illinois.    So Walker&#8217;s rhetoric is just that&#8211;trying to make hay out of the mere fact that Illinois increased its tax rates.  As Warren points out, politicians need to start thinking about what is good for the region and &#8220;not just poach others&#8217; enterprises&#8221;.   </p>
<p>We need to think strategically, as globalization has made it much easier for companies to move to greener pastures&#8211;not just other states, but out of the states.  Congress could help that by eliminating the provision in the Code that permits companies to move active business assets abroad without paying tax on the built-in gain.  In fact, Congress ought really to consider revamping the entire reorganization provisions in the Code.  We have seen that too big to fail banks are costly for us.  Rather than aiding consolidation of companies through nonrecognition provisions, what if we made reorganizations more difficult and costly?  Combine that with a renewed anti-trust vigor, and encourage smaller businesses to stay in this country.  Localvore could take on a new meaning.</p>

<p><strong>The Data Shows that State &#8220;Beggar Thy Neighbor&#8221; Policies Don&#8217;t Work.</strong><br />Cross posted at <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=297">the Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>Many states seem to believe a “beggar thy neighbor” approach to taxes works best. That is, the state with the lowest taxes will “steal” business from other states and produce the fastest economic growth.  A lot of people seem to believe it works.  The data stands in opposition to them.  </p>
<p>States raise revenues through a variety of means – state income taxes, property taxes, fines on overdue books, etc.  The <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/about/"> Tax Foundation </a>, which bills itself as “a nonpartisan tax research group based in Washington, D.C” and which I believe can be fairly described as generally advocating lower taxes in general, provides a <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sl_burden_ustotal&#038;allstates-20080807.xls"> file </a> showing the the overall state tax burden and per capita income for every state for each year from 1977 to 2008.  </p>
<p>So here’s what I did after the fold.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I took the per capita income, adjusted by the <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI-U</a>, and got the real per capita income, which I then used to compute the percentage growth (or shrinkage) in real per capita from one year to the next for every state and every year from 1977 to 2007.  I did the same thing for the US, getting the US average growth in real per capita income from t to t+1 for every year from 1977 to 2007, and subtracted that amount from the state growth rates.  This provided the amount by which each state grew (or shrunk) faster (or not) than average, each and every year from 1977 to 2007.</p>
<p>The next step was to take the state tax burden for each state for each year, and subtract from that the average state tax burden for that year.  Result:  1,550 combinations of (tax burden for a state in a year less average tax burden for all states for the same year) on one hand, and (growth in real per capita income from one year to the next for a state in a year less the average growth in real per capita income over the same period).  In other words, a comparison between being above or below average on tax burdens and being above or below average on real per capita income growth.  </p>
<p>Here’s a histogram:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TTOXopstG8I/AAAAAAAAAgk/wOtss0XyTm4/s1600/state%2Btaxes1.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TTOXopstG8I/AAAAAAAAAgk/wOtss0XyTm4/s400/state%2Btaxes1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>The graph is a bit busy, but let me interpret it. The first bar is for observations for which the tax burden was between 4.25% and 3.75% below (i.e., more 4.25% below, or less than or equal to 3.75% below) the average state tax burden for that year.(sentence updated&#8230;.dan)<br />There are 7 observations (figure in purple at the bottom), and the median growth rate for those 7observations was 1.65% slower than the average for that year.</p>
<p>What the graph tells us is that there seem to be two maxima; going the beggar thy neighbor route can lead to faster than average growth, and there is a sweet spot: keeping tax burdens at about 2.5% below average has, historically tended to be associated with growth rates in real per capita income 0.47% above average.  However, get too far away from that sweet spot and the doo-doo really hits the fan.  The states that keep the tax burdens the lowest also produce the slowest growth, on average.</p>
<p>For states that don’t take the beggar thy neighbor route (i.e., they take a tax and spend approach), things generally go a little better.  The sweet spot there – keeping tax burdens about 2% above average – produces growth rates about 0.67% above average.  And getting too far away from that sweet spot doesn’t seem to lead to catastrophic outcomes either.</p>

<p>This post continues the “Kimel curve” theme I’ve been following for the past few weeks, namely that there is a top that maximizes the growth of real GDP.  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=278">This post</a> has an analogous histogram showing the relationship between top marginal tax rates and growth in real GDP for the US from 1929 to the present.  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=268">This one</a> &#8211; the first of several to do so – computes the growth maximizing tax rate for the US economy.  I plan to go back to work on the national data analysis in the coming posts, but everyone needs a break now and then.</p>
<p>As always, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them.  Drop me a line at my first name, period my last name, at gmail period com.  And note my first name in the e-mail address is mike.  An “m” gets you someone else whose patience is starting wear thin.  Also, on the subject of “m”s – my last name has only one.  Because a lot of people have been asking for my spreadsheets as of late, to make things easier please tell me the the name of this post, the date it appeared, and where it appeared.  </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

                                <p>In 2005 Kash Mansori of Angry Bear took a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2005/06/are-earnings-rising-or-stagnant.html">Are Earnings Rising or Stagnant?</a> It is an issue worth periodic review:<br />
<blockquote>This question is not as easy to answer as it may first appear. In working on various posts last week I came across an apparent contradiction in the official data on compensation: some series show it rising in real terms, while others show it barely able to keep up with inflation. This discrepancy was also noted by a few readers, who deserve credit for their sharp eyes.</p>
<p>So I thought I’d take a bit of time to sort out these conflicting data series for myself. Here’s what I found. (A warning and apology here: what follows is a relatively econ-geeky post about data details that many may find uninteresting&#8230; and I won&#8217;t be offended if you stop reading here.)<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>So what’s my answer to the title question of this post? Personally, if I had to choose just one series to use it would be the P&#038;C series. In addition to being arguably the most complete series, it seems to have done the best job of matching my sense about how the economy has done over the past 20 years. When asked, I think that most people would agree that income growth was indeed much lower during 2002 and 2003 than it had been during the late 1990s; the P&#038;C series bears that out, while the ECI series doesn’t. Meanwhile, the CES series excludes benefits, which I think are a major part of the story today.</p>
<p>But let me reiterate the point that I have made several times now: just because real compensation is rising, that doesn’t mean that people are better off, particularly if nearly all of the gains are just going to paying higher health insurance premiums. This data persuasively illustrates that nearly all of our real compensation gains today (and I do think we&#8217;re seeing them) are being eaten up by the monster that we call a health care system in the US. Until we address the profound inadequacies of our health care system, this trend will only get worse.</p>

<p><strong>Spencer</strong> took another quick look in 2010, lifted from his email this Saturday:</p>
<p>This is not an easy subject and there is no &#8220;right&#8221; answer.  </p>
<p>A few comments.  The average hourly earnings data is for people who earn an hourly wage or punch a time clock as oppose to those earning a salary.  As a general rule this is the lower earning segment of the population as college educated professionals and managers are much more likely to be salaried. It reflects what is happening to about 80% of the labor force.  Surprisingly, this percent has not changed significantly over the years.  But the average hourly earnings data has clearly been changed by the changing composition of employment as more highly paid manufacturing employment has both declined in importance and relative pay.  </p>
<p>I always though of the ECI as a measure of what it cost a firm to keep an employee in the same job.  It is deliberately designed this way to try to avoid the problem of changing composition of the labor force from distorting the data.  There are positive and negatives to this.  </p>
<p>The compensation data is the most comprehensive measure of labor payments.  The one question I have never resolved to my own satisfaction is how it treats the payment to CEOs and other senior management with stock options.  It is a difficult accounting issue at the level of the individual firm, let alone for the aggregate economy.  But remember the chart I did a while back of compensation as a share of business cost.  From WW II to 1980 this was a very stable ratio with minor cyclical fluctuation around 66%.  But since 1980 labors share of the pie has been on a falling trend and is now at around 57% of business cost.  <br />I think this best shows the way the middle class has been squeezed. This measure avoids the issue of how to measure inflation.  </p>
<p>The best data for seeing the middle class squeeze is the data published by the Census on family and household income by age,sex, race,etc.,.  </p>
<p>All the inflation series have their drawbacks and shortcomings.  The PCE deflator does not have the cost of housing and so until the last few years probably significantly understated the true cost of living for the middle class.  We are all familiar with the unresolved issue of how the CPI treats housing cost.  <br />The CPI only measures &#8220;out-of-pocket&#8221; medical expenses and because of this I suspect it significantly  <br />understates and under-weights the impact of rapidly rising medical prices on the middle class.  All the Census data uses the CPI-U-RS that recalculated the CPI from 1978 to 2002 using the new methodology for the CPI that incorporates the rental equivalence housing measure and other methodological changes in the way the CPI is calculated.</p>

This is noteworthy given the apparent acceptance by politicos that Social Security needs fixing at all.  Here is part of the transcript:</p>
<p>MR. GREGORY:  Social Security, how does it have to change?  What they put on the agenda is raising the retirement age, maybe means testing benefits.  Is it time for Social Security to fundamentally change if you&#8217;re going to deal with the debt problem?</p>
<p>SEN. REID:  One of the things that always troubles me is, when we start talking about the debt, the first thing people do is run to Social Security. Social Security is a program that works, and it&#8217;s going to be&#8211;it&#8217;s fully funded for the next 40 years.  Stop picking on Social Security.  There are a lot places we can go to&#8230;</p>
<p>MR. GREGORY:  Senator, you&#8217;re really saying the arithmetic on Social Security works?</p>
<p>SEN. REID:  I&#8217;m saying the arithmetic on Social Security works.  I have no doubt it does.  For the next&#8230;</p>
<p>MR. GREGORY:  It&#8217;s not in crisis?</p>
<p>SEN. REID:  No, it&#8217;s not in crisis.  This is, this is, this is something that&#8217;s perpetuated by people who don&#8217;t like government.  Social Security is fine.  Are there things we can do to improve Social Security?  Of course.  But don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p>MR. GREGORY:  Means testing?  Raising the retirement age?</p>
<p>SEN. REID:  &#8230;don&#8217;t&#8211;I&#8217;m&#8230;</p>
<p>MR. GREGORY:  Do you agree with either of those?</p>
<p>SEN. REID:  I&#8217;m not going to go to any of those back-door methods to whack Social Security recipients.  I&#8217;m not going to do that.  We have a lot of things we can do with this debt that&#8217;s a problem.  But one of the places where I&#8217;m not going to be part of picking on is Social Security.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>

                                <p>for the longest time the earliest Annual Report of the Social Security Trustees readily available was that of the second Report in 1942 and that only in a fairly clumsy PDF format that doesn&#8217;t allow my browser to cut and paste (though I can from most PDFs). But the fine people (no snark) at ssa.gov/history made the 1941 Report available recently in HTML. And in the course of that dispel some myths about the origins of the Trust Fund which contrary to a certain strain of opinion was not a product of the 1983 legislation. Follow the link in the title or check out the excerpts under the fold. All from the actual text of the Report transmittal to Congress.</p>

<blockquote>The Federal old-age and survivors insurance trust fund was created pursuant to section 201 of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1939, approved August 10, 1939. This trust fund became effective on January 1, 1940, and superseded the old-age reserve account established under the Social Security Act of 1935. The trust fund is held by a Board of Trustees composed of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Chairman of the Social Security Board, all ex officio. The trust fund so held is available for the payment of old-age annuities and survivors insurance benefits and the necessary expenditures incurred by the Social Security Board and the Treasury Department in the administration of the program. The Secretary of the Treasury is designated as the Managing Trustee.</p>
<p>Resources made available to the trust fund included the securities held by the Secretary of the Treasury for the old-age reserve account, accounts standing to the credit of the old-age reserve account on the books of the Treasury as of January 1, 1940, and interest on the investments. The appropriation to the trust fund for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1941, and for each fiscal year thereafter, are required by section 201 of the Social Security Act, as amended, to be equivalent to 100 percent of the taxes (including interest, penalties, and additions to taxes) received under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and covered into the Treasury. Interest on and proceeds from the sale or redemption of any securities held by the trust fund are required to be credited to the fund.</p></blockquote>
<p>i.e. receipts from FICA and any interest on the Trust Funds are not fungeable, they are required to be credited to the Trust Fund. </p>
<blockquote><p>The old-age and survivors insurance trust fund provides a financial margin of safety for the system against the first impacts of unforeseen changes in the upward trend of disbursements as well as against these short-term fluctuations and contingencies. At the end of June 1940 approximately 50 million persons already held social security account numbers and about 42 million workers had made contributions toward benefits under the system. In the future, millions of additional workers will come under the program as they obtain jobs in covered employments. Most of the rights now being accumulated toward benefits by these contributors and insured workers will not mature for many years. Consequently, benefits under the program are expected to increase markedly over a long period. This results from the fact that larger numbers of workers will be eligible and will qualify for benefits and from the expectation that the proportion of the population in ages 65 and over, estimated at 7 per-cent in 1940, may eventually rise to perhaps 14 to 16 percent. Hence the essential assurance of future financial soundness of the system, with its rising rate of disbursement, rests on a graduated increase in contribution rates or provision of income from other sources, or both.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is a reserve fund. And increases in contribution rates were anticipated right from the beginning, the common belief that FDR promised that rates would never go up being simple after the fact bullshit. And the growth in beneficiary population over time equally anticipated.</p>
<blockquote><p>During the period January 1 to June 30, 1940, new investments amounting to $324.9 million were made for the fund and securities amounting to $22.0 million were redeemed as required to meet current withdrawals for benefit payments and administrative expenses. The new investments were in the form of special old-age and survivors insurance trust fund notes bearing 2.5 percent interest. As a result of these transactions the average interest rate on investments of the trust fund was 2.91 percent on June 30, 1940.</p>
<p>The assets of the old-age and survivors insurance trust fund as of June 30, 1940, were $1,744.7 million.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Trust Fund has ALWAYS been invested in Special Treasuries designated for that purpose.</p>

                                <p>Via Benzinga, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.benzinga.com/news/buybacks/11/01/775535/timmy-does-bailouts-geithner-shovels-more-bail-out-money-to-bank-of-ameri#ixzz1B1dN3sUU">L. Randall Wray notes</a> more of the same for socializing the costs of our financial woes:<br />
<blockquote>In truly depressing news, Secretary Treasury Geithner announced he was funneling $2.8 billion more bail-out funds to Bank of America. In the deal, Fannie and Freddie would agree to abandon claims that they had been sold trash in fraudulent “mortgage backed securities” by the BofA. (A similar deal was provided to Ally Financial.) </p>
<p>As I have written, holders of the securities have gradually realized that the securitizations did not meet the “reps and warranties” asserted by the banks that pooled mortgages. A growing number of investors have demanded that the originating banks take back the fraudulent securities, including Fannie and Freddie, as well as the NYFed and PIMCO. But true to form, Timmy prefers to backstop the control fraud banks rather than forcing them to bear the costs of their frauds. </p>
<p>The actual losses that Freddie and Fannie will take on the toxic waste sold to them by Countrywide (absorbed by Bank of America, which is now responsible for the put-backs) will undoubtedly be much larger than the $2.8 billion they received in the settlement. And guess who will suffer that extra loss? You betcha: Uncle Sam. As always, Geithner instinctively socializes losses to protect Wall Street&#8217;s private bonuses.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Health Care: Privacy and Security</strong><br />Technology both enabled these offenses and enabled the discovery of the offenses.</p>
<p><strong>First:</strong></p>
<p>Three employees and a contract nurse were terminated from the Tuscon University Medical Center for looking at medical records of the Tuscon shooting victims. None are accused of leaking any information.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>:</p>
<p>Darling daughter called me this week during the 11 o&#8217;clock news. Ohio Health had announced that patient data from Grant Hospital in Columbus had been compromised. She has been a patient there in the last six months.</p>
<p>An employee had stolen computers from the IT inventory, attempted to wipe the hard drives and then to sell the computers. Whatever data was lost was encrypted and the probability of a compromise is low, but Grant will be required to do the full court press on HIPAA security procedures (at no small cost).</p>

                                <p>Paul Krugman has been outdone by someone else who works for the New York Times</p>
<p>&#8220;Opinions on Shape of Earth Differ; Both Sides Have a Point&#8221; was exteme but <br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/08/health/policy/08cong.html">&#8220;In Battle Over Health Law, Math Cuts Both Ways&#8221;</a> is the epitome of a nadir.</p>
<p>The key word which Krugman missed is &#8220;math&#8221;.  To Krugman math is a set of artificially constructed theoretical systems in which meanings are more than usually precise and answers often have a right answer and a wrong answer.</p>
<p>For a true journamalist, math is black magic and any claim in math might be true.  It is the perfect setting for he said he said.  </p>
<p>I do not blame the headline guy.  The article by DAVID M. HERSZENHORN is as appalling as the headline.  The article contains plainly false claims on matters of fact.  One is clear enough that the New York Times must publish a correction.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In this case the debate in which both sides have a point (by the jounamalists definition of debate) is between the CBO and Republicans in congress.  Note that the non-partisan CBO is considered one side of the debate.  No Democrats in congress are quoted at all.  The debate is over the fact that the CBO scores repeal of the affordable care act as adding to the deficit.  Notably, according to the rules of the last congress, this verdict is final.  Not because the CBO is God (or even Moses) but just because some terms must be defined, the CBO scoring is written into the rules (and will be again as soon as the Republicans are done with their repeal the ACA stunt)</p>
<p>Herszenshon makes no mention of the fact that rejecting the CBO score is generally not allowed.  The CBO score becomes just one opinion among many.  Unfortunately for Ballance, the argument against the CBO score includes many lies.</p>
<p>Mr Herszenhorn asserts &#8220;The Democrats designed the health care law so that most of the cuts and new taxes begin early while most of the spending, on insurance subsidies, for instance, begins in 2014.&#8221;  I stress this claim is made in his name and in the name of the Times.  It is a false claim which must be corrected.  The weasle word &#8220;most&#8221; doesn&#8217;t do the trick.   It is there because the excise tax starts well after 2014.  In fact, the tax increases and spending cuts roughly track the spending increases.  The claim in the New York Times is deliberately vague but still false.</p>
<p>A grosser falsehood (in this case a lie) is put in the mouths of un named &#8220;Republicans.&#8221;  &#8220;The Republicans also say that the budget rules effectively double-count nearly $400 billion in Medicare savings as both reducing the cost of the health care law and prolonging the life of the Medicare trust fund.&#8221;  This is false.  All of the budget rules discussed in the article are CBO rules which do not estimate the life of the Medicare trust fund.  The DBO did not double count.  Herszenhorn knows this.  That is why instead of writing &#8220;the CBO&#8221; as in the rest of the article he wrote &#8220;the budget rules.&#8221;  In this case as well he is attempting to mislead the reader.  Again he fails.  <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2011/01/omnibus_post_on_the_gimmicks_i.html#more">Via Ezra Klein</a> note <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/03/the_true_cost_of_the_health-ca.html">Paul Ryan</a> admitting that the CBO didn&#8217;t double count </p>
<p>By stating a false claim of fact without either noting that it is false or allowing someone honest to contest the claim, Herszenhorn effectively makes the claim his own.</p>
<p>He goes on to do it again &#8220;They also complain that the projections omitted $115 billion in spending required to administer the law&#8221;!  This claim is false.  $115 is the forecast discretionary budget of agencies in any way involved with implementing the ACA. It is not an estimate of additional funding which congress is predicted to appropriate because of the bill.  In any case, that would require new bills and Republicans don&#8217;t have to vote for them.  The same post by Klein again</p>
<blockquote><p>The $115 billion isn&#8217;t &#8220;implementation&#8221; but &#8220;discretionary spending.&#8221; And most of that spending predates the bill. As CBO Director Doug Elmendorf said, &#8220;CBO’s discretionary baseline, which assumes that 2010 appropriations are extended with adjustments for anticipated inflation, already accounts for much of the potential discretionary spending under PPACA.&#8221; The exact amount it already accounts for is $86 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>One car argue about the predicted additional $29 billion but not about the $86 billion which are just past appropriations of the agencies updated for inflation. The $29 billion forecast almost certainly won&#8217;t occur, since Republicans will not vote for them.</p>
<p>The outlay of the article is as bad as the errors of fact.  Long befor explaining the CBO estimates Herszenhorn writes the colorful and totally nonsensical</p>
<blockquote><p>And, for the love of gravity and basic mathematics, how can the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the official scorekeeper charged with keeping count of the nation’s fiscal condition, say that it would cost the government $230 billion over 10 years to repeal a law that would spend $930 billion to extend health insurance to 32 million people? </p></blockquote>
<p>Evidently in the sub first grade understanding he ascribed to his readers A-B>0.  The problem is that many readers will just read the first few paragraphs and most will remember &#8220;the love of gravity and basic mathematics&#8221; long after they have forgotton the tiny bits of mathematics allowed into the article.</p>
<p>This is mainstream journalism at its worst.  If a major party argues somethign based on lies and nonsense, then counteraguments which would show them to be fools and or knaves must be suppressed.  Math is totally mysterious.  Plainly false claims of fact must not be checked because saying that a claim is false is shrill and unbalanced.  Perhaps I overstate my claim.  I have seen no evidence that such nonsense is repeated with so much deference if it comes from the Democrats.</p>
<p>There are lies, damn lies and statistics as presented by the MSM.</p>
