                                <p>by <strong><a href="http://presimetrics.com/">Mike Kimel</a></strong></p>
<p>Following a merger, a few months ago I took a severance package from my most recent employer.  Put another way, I became unemployed.  I started looking for another job but without much luck. In the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve also started doing some consulting work with two clients.  Its been sporadic but lucrative, and I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to ramp that up quickly.  Having been a consultant before for eight years, I know the tough thing is always maintaining a strong enough stable of clients.  (FYI, the work I&#8217;ve been doing has been economic analysis, business analytics, and litigation support.  If you or anyone needs that sort of a skillset, drop me a line at &#8220;mike&#8221; period &#8220;kimel&#8221; at &#8220;gmail.com.&#8221;)  Fortunately, in addition to the consulting, we have some other income coming in and a fair amount saved up, so I don&#8217;t need to get 100 mph immediately.</p>
<p>One of the drawbacks of being unemployed or an independent consultant involves health insurance.  When I left my employer, I became eligible for COBRA.  Here&#8217;s my ongoing COBRA story.  I&#8217;m going to change all names to protect the guilty and innocent alike.  Call my former employer A, the COBRA administrator they use B, and my insurance company C.</p>
<p>A few weeks after I took the severance, A informed B that I was no longer with the company and thus eligible for COBRA.  I had been checking B&#8217;s website religiously because I&#8217;m kind of paranoid about lacking health insurance.  So one day, I logged on and found that I was eligible.  But there was a small problem &#8211; somewhere along the line, I had lost my dependents.  So I called B, B called A, some other stuff happened in the background, a day or two went by, and when I logged in, lo and behold, my wife was now listed as a dependent.  But there was a small problem &#8211; I also happen to have a (at the time) thirteen month old son.  So I called B, B called A, some other stuff happened in the background, a day or two went by, and when I logged in, lo and behold, my son was now listed as a dependent.   But there was a small problem &#8211; neither of my dependents was listed as having been on my insurance policies when I was employed, thus making them ineligible for COBRA coverage.  So I called B, B called A, some other stuff happened in the background, and when I logged in, lo and behold, my wife was listed as having been on my health insurance.  But there was a small problem &#8211; my son was not listed as having had health insurance, making him ineligible for COBRA.  So I called B, B called A, some other stuff happened in the background, and when I logged in, lo and behold,  both my dependents were listed as having been on my health insurance policy when I was employed.  But there was a small problem &#8211; it seems that the records provided indicated that I had two spouses and no son.  One of my two spouses, interestingly enough, had the same name, birthday and gender as my now non-existent son.  The records, in other words, indicated that I personally was violating a nontrivial number of laws. So I called B, B called A, some other stuff happened in the background, and when I logged in, lo and behold, well, I couldn&#8217;t find the mistake in the records.  So I signed up for COBRA, and I put us on direct payment from my bank account.</p>
<p>All&#8217;s well that ends well, no matter how much time is wasted.  But I did mention that my insurance company, C, was going to be a part of the story, right?  Today a letter comes in the mail.  My wife had gone to a dermatologist.  The dermatologist submitted the bill to C.  C informed the dermatologist that we no longer had coverage.  </p>
<p>So I called B.  It was a lovely conversation.  I was informed that, yes, they have been withdrawing money from my account, and yes, I am paid in full, but nevertheless, C&#8217;s records do show us having no coverage.  I was told B is calling C.  I was told that in 24 to 48 hours I need to call C to see if they listed us as having the insurance coverage for which I have been paying.  At some later point my wife or I will also have to call the dermatologist.  Call me cynical, but I expect this is going to take a lot of time and interfere with my ability to generate income.  </p>
<p>As an aside, in the past few weeks we&#8217;ve started looking at new insurance options. Interestingly enough, it seems that if everyone in the family is generally healthy, COBRA is generally not the best option.</p>

<p>&#8230;. to keep mom/dad alive.</p>
<p>Physicians and nurses often dread these conversations. Any of us who have been on the family side of this know how agonizing it can be.</p>
<p>And I know even mentioning this can cause a firestorm.</p>
<p>However, there are some unsettling issues raised by these conversations, issues that are a sort of third rail of health care (and no there are no proposed death panels).</p>
<p>First, does this attitude increase suffering? Many of the elderly have 4 &#8211; 10 major diagnosis (COPD, CHF, PAD, diabetes, a-fib, etc. etc.) and very little quality of life. Especially problematic is the ping-pong that often occurs between the hospital and the nursing home (families often see a transfer to the hospital as a magic bullet, physicians often give in).</p>
<p>Second, Medicare is paying for a great deal of hospital care that may have very little value.</p>
<p>No one wants the government making these decisions, but at some point the care is futile and often painful. Some patients and families deal with these issues well, others do not.</p>
<p>For my part, I have a health care POA, a living will, and everybody in the family knows the course of action I want in various situations. Ditto for Mrs. R. It is still tough though.</p>

On a year-over-year basis real average hourly and weekly earnings are down -2.4%.</p>
<p>With real wages falling so steeply no wonder the retail sales report was weaker than expected.<br />I continue to stick with my position that with wage growth so weak the economy can not sustain accelerating inflation.  Higher inflation will lead to a weaker economy, not an inflationary spiral.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking Engagement</strong></p>
<p>If anyone is in the Akron, Ohio area and has any interest, I will be giving a guest lecture at David Cohen&#8217;s American Presidency class on Monday Sept. 19. The class runs from 12:05-12:55 in Leigh Hall 510.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be talking about <strong><em>Presimetrics</em></strong>, the book I co-authored with Michael Kanell.  I&#8217;ve prepared a few slides which I&#8217;ll make into a post after the lecture.</p>

<p>I present some basic statistics to highlight the problem in Europe. In short, there exists a deleterious positive feedback loop between overly leveraged banks and their sovereigns in key markets.</p>
<p>Exhibit 1: European Banks are overly levered. Spanning 2006 through the latest data point, key European banking systems &#8211; France, Germany, and Italy &#8211; increased leverage.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-po8bdUAaJt0/Tm6X9RXpxJI/AAAAAAAAD7o/60EU56tICYY/s1600/bank_leverage.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-po8bdUAaJt0/Tm6X9RXpxJI/AAAAAAAAD7o/60EU56tICYY/s400/bank_leverage.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>The chart above illustrates the ratio of bank assets to capital (see the <a href="http://fsi.imf.org/">IMF&#8217;s Financial Soundness Indicators</a> for the data and description of &#8216;capital&#8217;). The countries are ranked by largest % drop in bank leverage spanning the period 2006 to current (Greece, Austria, and Belgium) to the largest % surge in leverage spanning the same period (France, Italy, and the UK). Note: the 2006 data is taken from the <a href="http://www.imf.org/External/Pubs/FT/GFSR/2007/02/pdf/statappx.pdf">2007 IMF Global Financial Stability Report</a>.</p>
<p>The level of leverage is not strictly comparable across countries due to differences in national accounting, taxation, and supervisory regimes. However, while the US banks have delevered over the period, the big European banks &#8211; Germany, Italy, and France &#8211; have increased leverage. Assets need to be written down.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Exhibit 2. While leverage is too high, asset quality is dropping. The banks are increasing exposure to government loans and securities relative to traditional loans.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VYxTd40z7os/Tm6Y_IwXJGI/AAAAAAAAD7w/kbjlZxYz3Tk/s1600/asset_quality_chart.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VYxTd40z7os/Tm6Y_IwXJGI/AAAAAAAAD7w/kbjlZxYz3Tk/s400/asset_quality_chart.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>The chart illustrates the nominal stock of loans held on the bank balance sheets of the Monetary Financial Institutions in Europe. The data are <a href="http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/browse.do?node=2116074">from the ECB</a>. Loans to governments and holdings of government securities are increasing more swiftly than traditional lending.</p>
<p>Exhibit 3. The asset quality of that rising stock of loans to the government sector is deteriorating&#8230;quickly. Italian and Spanish 10yr bonds are 1.5% and 1.2% higher, respectively, since the beginning of 2010, while German 10-yr yields are 1.5% lower.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hpfo0_BAgWk/Tm6d8tDEF8I/AAAAAAAAD8A/UCK3jWTFe3M/s1600/bond_yields_chart.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hpfo0_BAgWk/Tm6d8tDEF8I/AAAAAAAAD8A/UCK3jWTFe3M/s400/bond_yields_chart.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> The chart illustrates the 10-yr bonds across the euro area bond markets. The latest data point (today around 12pm) is listed in the legend.</p>
<p>Bond investors are clearly differentiating between the riskier bonds &#8211; Spain, Portugal, and Belgium &#8211; from the &#8216;core&#8217; &#8211; Germany, Netherlands, Austria, Finland, and yes, France. Whether or not bond markets are right to regard Finland or France as &#8216;core&#8217; is a different matter entirely. But the point is clear: bond markets are in crisis mode, and there&#8217;s a stark segmentation in yields across the region.</p>
<p>Cross border exposure dictates that some of these highly levered banking systems are exposed to the same government securities currently trading at distressed levels. A case in point is France with outsized exposure to Italy and Greece (see <a href="http://www.bis.org/statistics/consstats.htm">Table 9B</a>).

                                <p>Some of you may remember that last cycle I sometimes posted charts showing real exports and imports versus trend to show how trade  was doing.  It is now over two years since imports and exports bottomed so I thought It was time to update those charts for this cycle.  But as I started looking at the data I made a very interesting discovery.</p>
<p>Real petroleum exports &#8212; both crude and refined product  &#8212; are exploding. After being flat for years, petroleum exports have been growing at some 33% to 50% rates since 2006.  They have leaped from about $2 B (2005 $) to over $5 B (2005 $).  This is a significant development that few people have recognized.</p>

For example from 1994 to 2005 petroleum exports had fallen from a sum equal to about 10% of petroleum imports  to under 5%.   But they now amount  to almost a third of petroleum imports.<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7TTT6cCpQTU/Tm-0wDttVnI/AAAAAAAABv0/Wg46s4PfjtY/s1600/Clipboard01%2BOIL%2BSHARE%2BOF%2BIMP.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7TTT6cCpQTU/Tm-0wDttVnI/AAAAAAAABv0/Wg46s4PfjtY/s320/Clipboard01%2BOIL%2BSHARE%2BOF%2BIMP.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Consequently,  when you look at US dependence on foreign oil it makes a big difference in the analysis if you just look at the data on gross imports or if you adjust the data to look at net petroleum imports &#8212; imports less exports. Gross imports show that since the last cyclical peak the combination of falling demand and even  expanded domestic production over the last couple of years had produced a significant drop in real petroleum imports. I&#8217;ve long used oil imports as a measure of the US marginal demand for oil.   This approach shows that real petroleum imports have fallen to their level of about ten years sago &#8212; a rather import ant development.   But if you look at the net data, real petroleum imports are back to levels of 20 years ago.  This shows that the US is making much more significant progress  in reducing its dependence on foreign oil than is generally recognized.</p>

<p>This also has a significant impact on the US balance of trade. In recent months the real trade balance has appeared to be bottoming and this has been starting  to get economists and analysts optimistic that trade could make a significant positive contribution to growth in coming quarters.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bk7dFnUjJlc/Tm-1DjEBpOI/AAAAAAAABwE/BxJ4UXcPJHE/s1600/Clipboard01%2BBALANCE%2BALL.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bk7dFnUjJlc/Tm-1DjEBpOI/AAAAAAAABwE/BxJ4UXcPJHE/s320/Clipboard01%2BBALANCE%2BALL.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>But the improvement has almost all stemmed from petroleum.  The real trade balance excluding petroleum is still deteriorating, although maybe not as severely as it had been earlier in the cycle.</p>

<p>Moreover, if you look at real non-petroleum exports they appear to be rolling over. When I tried to do a trend analysis neither a linear or  an exponential equation generated a good fit.  I had to resort to a polynomial equation to get a good fit.   But real non-petroleum exports shows  significantly worse prospects for trade adding to growth in coming quarters that the consensus expects.<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5xiDiyBlTag/TnDFgQw1NZI/AAAAAAAABwk/KIkA_Xu2d24/s1600/Clipboard11.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5xiDiyBlTag/TnDFgQw1NZI/AAAAAAAABwk/KIkA_Xu2d24/s320/Clipboard11.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>

                                <p>The Census Bureau has released estimates of poverty in 2010. Coverage focused on the headline poverty rate which is horrible enough. Much worse, 6.7% of people in the USA suffered severe poverty, that is lived in households with income less than half the poverty line. This is the highest severe poverty rate on record (the series only goes back to 1975 &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why). </p>
<p><a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/historical/people.html">Look at Table Five.</a></p>
<p>I blame welfare reform.  Yes the severe recession and slow recovery is a major factor, but the 2010 ratio of the severe poverty rate and the poverty rate is 0.444 which is also the highest on record.  That ratio is a crude way of looking at the effect of welfare reform. </p>
<p>Like the poverty rate, the severe poverty rate goes up in recessions, goes up when inequality increases and goes down when per capita income grows. However, the pattern is very different with a long term trend of increasing severe poverty and no correspond trend of the headline poverty rate. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I think it is clear that this can be explained with two acronyms AFDC and TANF. In 1975 the economy was in bad shape, the poverty rate was 12.3 % which is not vastly lower than the 2010 poverty rate of 15.1%. The severe poverty rate was 3.7 % less than 56% of the current rate. The fraction of people in poverty but not severe poverty was 0.301 in 1975 much lower than it is now.</p>
<p>During the period of high inflation, the real value of welfare benefits declined. This explains at least part of the increase in severe poverty. In 1983 the poverty rate peaked at 15.2% and the severe poverty rate peaked at 5.9%. Compared to 1983 a smaller fraction of people are in poverty but a larger fraction of people are in severe poverty. I think that welfare reform is the only plausible explanation.</p>
<p>If the ratio of number in severe poverty to number in poverty were the same as in 1983 the severe poverty rate would be less than 5.9%.  </p>
<p>This post is an update of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/all-time-record-level-of-severe-poverty.html">my post about the 2009 severe poverty rate </a>(I admit to cutting and pasting as if such an admission were necessary).  The political debate has not taken the record severe poverty rate into consideration. Quite the opposite. As far as I know, no politician dares discuss reversing welfare reform.   </p>
<p> I think the still widely accepted conclusion that welfare reform was a great success is based on two gross and obvious errors. </p>
<p>First the matter was considered to have been decided by 2000. Only specialists reconsidered the analysis of welfare reform with any data not collected during the amazing boom of the late 90s. </p>
<p>Second a huge amount of attention is focused on the poverty rate and almost no one ever looks at the severe poverty rate. It is as if people think that it doesn&#8217;t matter how poor one is once one is under the poverty line. This is more extreme than not caring about income distribution. </p>
<p>But it is accepted as a fact that welfare reform worked like a charm. Evidence which isn&#8217;t more than 11 years old, and the fact that $11,000 <br />It&#8217;s almost as if most people had no clue what it is like to be poor so that they don&#8217;t even know that the poor are much poorer than they used to be.</p>

                                <p>The current low level of long term interest rates is creating all types of debate about what it is suppose to signify and what investors are discounting.</p>
<p>Maybe they are not signaling anything and it is just a return to normal for interest rates.  For example, from 1871 to 1960 long Treasuries were below 4% some 75%of the time.   Over the long sweep of history very low rates were more the norm than the high rates of recent decades.  Maybe the recent history was the exception and we are now just returning to a more normal level of rates.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>

<p><strong>The Effect of Individual Income Tax Rates on the Economy, Part 6: 1981 &#8211; 1993</strong> </p>
<p>This post is the sixth in a series that looks at the relationship between real economic growth and the top individual marginal tax rate.  The first looked at the period from 1901 to 1928, the second from 1929 to 1940, the third from 1940 to 1950, the fifth looked at 1950 &#8211; 1968, and the sixth from 1968 to 1988.  Because the Reagan era is so pivotal in the American psyche, though it was covered in the last post, I intend to focus on it again.  The last post included the lead in to Reagan&#8217;s term, this post contains the follow-up to his term.  In this post I&#8217;ll look at the period from 1981 to 1993.  </p>
<p>Before I begin, a quick recap&#8230;  both the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1901 &#8211; 1928 period</a> and the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_22.html">1929 &#8211; 1940</a> failed to show the textbook relationship between taxes and growth.  In fact, it seems that for both those periods, there was at least a bit of support for the notion that growth was faster in periods of rising tax rates than in periods when tax rates were coming down.  It is worth noting that growth from 1933 to 1940 was generally quite a bit faster than at any other peacetime period since data has been available, both on average and for individual years.  Not quite quite what people believe, but that&#8217;s what it is.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_29.html">1940 &#8211; 1950</a> period, we did observe slower economic growth following a tax hike and faster economic growth followed a tax reduction.  However, that happened when the top marginal tax rate was boosted above 90%.  <br />Interestingly enough, though the so-called &#8220;Kennedy Tax Cuts&#8221; are often used as one of the prime exhibits on the benefits of cutting taxes, a look at the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1950 &#8211; 1968</a> period yields no such conclusion.  Growth rates were already rising before the tax cuts occurred in 1964 and 1965, reached a peak when the tax cuts took place, and started shrinking immediately afterwards. The other period that is always pointed to as evidence that tax cuts spur growth is the Reagan years, which showed up in the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_1325.html">1968 &#8211; 1988</a> post.  It turns out that put into context, the Reagan years produced one year of rapid but not particularly extraordinary growth a few years after tax cuts began.  That&#8217;s it.  </p>

<p>Real GDP figures used in this post come from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis.</a>  Top individual marginal tax rate figures used in this post come from the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a>.  As in previous posts, I’m using growth rate from one year to the next (e.g., the 1980 figure shows growth from 1980 to 1981) to avoid “what leads what” questions. If there is a causal relationship between the tax rate and the growth rate, the growth rate from 1980 to 1981 cannot be causing the 1980 tax rate.  Let me stress this point again as I&#8217;ve been getting people e-mailing me to tell me I&#8217;ve got the growth rates shifted a year.  That is correct, and is being done on purpose (and is shown on the graph labels).  To avoid questions of causality, the growth rate in year X used in this post is the growth rate from year X to year X+1.  And when I say &#8220;to avoid questions of causality&#8221; &#8211; you&#8217;d be amazed at how many people write me when I don&#8217;t do this and insist that sure, higher tax rates seem to be correlated with faster growth, but that&#8217;s because when growth is faster governments feel more willing to charge higher tax rates.</p>
<p>With the preliminaries out of the way, let&#8217;s get started.  The first graph shows the tax rates from 1981 to 1993 along with the t to t+1 real GDP growth rates.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_mUizk7USxg/Tm1ODoiD7lI/AAAAAAAAAtI/CoYppBxqLJA/s1600/Figure_1_-_1981_-_1993.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_mUizk7USxg/Tm1ODoiD7lI/AAAAAAAAAtI/CoYppBxqLJA/s320/Figure_1_-_1981_-_1993.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that what the graph does not, repeat, does not show is that lower tax rates have much to do with faster economic growth.  In fact, some of the slowest sustained economic &#8220;growth&#8221; that occurred during the Reagan-Bush years coincided with the lowest tax rates:  28% and 31%.  The one standout year occurred when tax rates were at 50%, and had been at 50% for a few years.  And yet, somehow this period has entered the public consciousness as Exhibit A that Tax Cuts Work.  </p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;d like to point out that unlike the folks who venerate Reagan today, Reagan himself did have a reason, an excellent reason, in fact, to try tax cuts&#8230; at least the first round of tax cuts.  Looking back from the vantage point of 1980 and leaving out the WW2 years, real economic growth when tax rates were in the 90% + range was lower than it was when tax rates were in the 80% to 89.9% range, and that was slower than when tax rates were in the 70% to 79.9% range, and that in turn was slower than when tax rates were in the 60% to 69.9%.  That is shown in the graph below.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O2fwRwsWdSI/Tm1OYbsuqPI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/Kk4hp-yUxF0/s1600/Figure_2_-_1981_-_1993.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O2fwRwsWdSI/Tm1OYbsuqPI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/Kk4hp-yUxF0/s320/Figure_2_-_1981_-_1993.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>Note that all the information contained in Figure 2 was available by the time Reagan took office.  If the information in Figure 2 is all you have,  it isn&#8217;t unreasonable to wonder whether further reductions in the tax rate will lead to faster economic growth.  Of course, Reagan did have a bit more information available.  He also had growth rates from the last time tax rates were in the 24% and 25% range  (i.e., the start of the Great Depression) which were negative&#8230; and which might have tipped him off that the relationship between tax rates and growth is actually quadratic.  But I guess its a bit much to expect any of Reagan&#8217;s advisors to consider anything like a <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/24732335">quadratic relationship</a>. </p>
<p>In any case, we can combine Figures 1 and 2 to put the Reagan &#8211; Bush rates into context:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uAgbprfASbo/Tm1QByAQpyI/AAAAAAAAAtY/7ALYtKzMX1k/s1600/Figure_3_-_1981_-_1993.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uAgbprfASbo/Tm1QByAQpyI/AAAAAAAAAtY/7ALYtKzMX1k/s320/Figure_3_-_1981_-_1993.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering, during seven of the 12 Reagan-Bush years, growth rates were actually below the average rate observed when top marginal tax rates were above 90%&#8230; and the really slow growth during the Reagan &#8211; Bush era occurred disproportionately when tax rates were at the 28% and 31%.  That is to say, when tax rates were at their lowest levels in the Reagan &#8211; Bush era, growth rates were also at their lowest.   And as the graph also shows, every single year, repeat, every single year of the Reagan Bush had a lower average growth rate than when tax rates were in the 60% to 69.9% range.  </p>
<p>So&#8230;  what we don&#8217;t from the Reagan &#8211; Bush era is anything that supports the notion that lower tax rates correlate with faster economic growth.  (Note&#8230; correlation does not imply causality, but lack of correlation certainly does imply lack of causality.)  We do see that it could have been a rational experiment for Reagan to cut tax rates from 70% to 50%.  It was not a rational experiment, based on what happened at 50%, to cut rates further, and the result was easily predictable.  </p>
<p>And speaking of rational&#8230;  the story the data tells is strongly at odds with what is commonly believed.  And this isn&#8217;t ancient history.  Most of us lived through this.  It isn&#8217;t rational for us to believe things that aren&#8217;t true.  But collectively, we do.  And its leading to crummy growth rates.  What a surprise.</p>
