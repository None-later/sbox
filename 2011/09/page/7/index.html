Call or write committee chairs for more open meetings.:</p>
<p>Senator Patty Murray: (202) 224-2621   <br />Representative Jeb Hensarling: (202) 225-3484</p>
<blockquote><p>Sample Script:</p>
<p>Hello, my name is ________ and I am calling to ask that [SENATOR MURRAY / REP. HENSARLING] work to ensure the public will continue to have access to the Super Congress&#8217; meetings.</p>
<p>I was pleased to hear that the first two meetings of the Super Congress would be broadcast live, but am concerned about what will happen when actual negotiations begin. It is very important that, as co-chair of the Super Congress, [SENATOR MURRAY / REP. HENSARLING] do everything in her/his power to provide public access to these hearings.</p>
<p>CSPAN broadcasts committee hearings all the time, and it would not be difficult to make these deliberations public as well. I urge [SENATOR MURRAY / REP. HENSARLING] to keep the Super Congress open to the public.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p><strong>The Effect of Individual Income Tax Rates on the Economy, Part 5: 1968 &#8211; 1988</strong><br />This post is the fourth in a series that looks at the relationship between real economic growth and the top individual marginal tax rate.  The first looked at the period from 1901 to 1928, the second from 1929 to 1940, the third from 1940 to 1950, and the fifth looked at 1950 &#8211; 1968.</p>
<p>Before I begin, a quick recap&#8230;  both the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1901 &#8211; 1928 period</a> and the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_22.html">1929 &#8211; 1940</a> failed to show the textbook relationship between taxes and growth.  In fact, it seems that for both those periods, there was at least a bit of support for the notion that growth was faster in periods of rising tax rates than in periods when tax rates were coming down.  In the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_29.html">1940 &#8211; 1950</a> period, we did observe slower economic growth following a tax hike and faster economic growth followed a tax reduction.  However, that happened when the top marginal tax rate was boosted above 90%.  Interestingly enough, though the so-called &#8220;Kennedy Tax Cuts&#8221; are often used as one of the prime exhibits on the benefits of cutting taxes, a look at the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1950 &#8211; 1968</a> period yields no such conclusion.  Growth rates were already rising before the tax cuts occurred in 1964 and 1965, reached a peak when the tax cuts took place, and started shrinking immediately afterwards. </p>
<p>Real GDP figures used in this post come from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis.</a>  Top individual marginal tax rate figures used in this post come from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a>.  As in previous posts, I’m using growth rate from one year to the next (e.g., the 1980 figure shows growth from 1980 to 1981) to avoid “what leads what” questions. If there is a causal relationship between the tax rate and the growth rate, the growth rate from 1980 to 1981 cannot be causing the 1980 tax rate.  Let me stress this point again as I&#8217;ve been getting people e-mailing me to tell me I&#8217;ve got the growth rates shifted a year.  That is correct, and is being done on purpose (and is shown on the graph labels).  To avoid questions of causality, the growth rate in year X used in this post is the growth rate from year X to year X+1.  And when I say &#8220;to avoid questions of causality&#8221; &#8211; you&#8217;d be amazed at how many people write me when I don&#8217;t do this and insist that sure, higher tax rates seem to be correlated with faster growth, but that&#8217;s because when growth is faster governments feel more willing to charge higher tax rates.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get started below the fold:<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s put up a diagram showing growth rates and tax rates for the period from 1968 to 1988.  But we almost don&#8217;t have to do it. We all know what happened.  We&#8217;ve been told so many times.  Tax rates were very high in the late 60s and 70s.  And then came <strikethrough>the Lone Ranger</strikethrough> Reagan, and, and lo, Reagan cut taxes.  The result is that the economy began to grow like never before.  Sure, the story is strikingly similar to the one about the tax cuts in the 1960s, and we know from the last post how that turned out.  But still, the Reagan story is even more widely accepted, so here&#8217;s the graph that accompanies the story:</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B_fasxOfbAc/TmgQ48iMK8I/AAAAAAAAAsw/X7jXyVFVtFc/s1600/partfive1.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="198" width="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B_fasxOfbAc/TmgQ48iMK8I/AAAAAAAAAsw/X7jXyVFVtFc/s320/partfive1.jpg"></a></div>
<p>Figure 1.</p>
<p>Wait.  That can&#8217;t be right.  Something is wrong with the data because it doesn&#8217;t match the narrative!!!  Yes, there was a tax cut and the economy started growing.  But the only growth that was unusually strong for the time period occurred in one single year, from 1983 to 1984.  And immediately afterwards it dropped and kept dropping.  </p>
<p>In 1987, there was a small pickup in growth which accompanied a further tax cut (50% to 38.5%), but the year after, when the top marginal tax rate dropped further (to 28%), growth fell again. </p>
<p>Strip away the rhetoric, and it would seem the &#8220;evidence&#8221; for the benefits of Reaganomics, for the most part, are that following the small tax cut in 1981 (70% to 69.25%) and the bigger one in 1982 (69.25% to 50%), there was one seemingly extraordinary year of growth from 1983 to 1984.   I could swear the narrative usually isn&#8217;t stated in this way.    </p>
<p>But let&#8217;s take a close-up of the Reagan years and put them (and the one extraordinary year) in perspective.  In the next graph we have the 1980 -1988, but for comparison, I&#8217;ve included the growth rate from 1938 to 1939.  That happens to be the third slowest year of the pre-WW2 New Deal era.  Here&#8217;s what it looks like:</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PG8gOI6EnLo/TmgRWfL_kfI/AAAAAAAAAs4/npXDBW1GAUs/s1600/partfive2.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="198" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PG8gOI6EnLo/TmgRWfL_kfI/AAAAAAAAAs4/npXDBW1GAUs/s320/partfive2.jpg"></a></div>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>Now, you may be able to noodle out why I picked the third slowest year of FDR&#8217;s first 8 years from the graph &#8211; see, it turns out that Reagan&#8217;s best year was faster than FDR&#8217;s worst, and FDR&#8217;s second worst pre-WW2 years, but that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>Redoing Figure 2 and adding in FDR&#8217;s best pre-WW2 New Deal year:  1940 to 1941, produces this graph:</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gm2TX1GQY7U/TmgRho3OV7I/AAAAAAAAAtA/jPQ9NhAdB9Y/s1600/partfive3.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="198" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gm2TX1GQY7U/TmgRho3OV7I/AAAAAAAAAtA/jPQ9NhAdB9Y/s320/partfive3.jpg"></a></div>
<p>Figure 3.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t look at all like what you learn in school, eh?  How about what you hear on Fox?  Or from El Rushbo?  What about from Rick Perry?  Heck, you don&#8217;t even hear about this from liberals.  </p>
<p>What you will hear is denial, and on the rare occasions where someone is willing to accept the data, excuses.   Now, I&#8217;m sympathetic to the idea that FDR and Reagan were Presidents at very different times, that perhaps FDR had higher potential growth due to a bounceback effect  (I don&#8217;t buy it, but I&#8217;m sympathetic to the idea).  I also don&#8217;t find it offensive if someone states that times and laws were different, and even if Reagan had FDR&#8217;s approach to government in mind, he could never have enacted the same policies that FDR applied.  What I am not sympathetic to are people who tell us about how well Reagan&#8217;s policies worked and who also insist that FDR ruined the economy or made it worse.  People who make such claims  can only fall into two categories, the &#8220;good&#8221; one being the misinformed.  </p>
<p>So to sum up&#8230; so far in this series&#8230;  it seems the evidence has been at least weakly against the idea that tax cuts lead to faster economic growth in the 1901 &#8211; 1928, 1929 &#8211; 1940, and 1950 &#8211; 1968 periods.  The 1940 &#8211; 1950 period does seem to behave consistently with that notion, though it is worth noting that it happened when tax rates were above 90%.  The period from 1950 &#8211; 1968, despite the frequent obfuscatory comments from certain sectors, also completely fails to support the notion that lower tax rates are followed by faster economic growth.  And frankly, the 1970s and 1980s don&#8217;t help the cause either.</p>
<p>Because the Reagan years play such an important role in the way we do economic policy in this country, we&#8217;ll revisit them in the next post in the series.  </p>

                                <p>Reuters provides a synopsis of a report by the OECD on <a target="_blank" href="http://link.reuters.com/pek53s">tax-avoidance strategies by multinational corporations</a>:
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>30/08/2011 &#8211; Due to the recent financial and economic crisis, global corporate losses have increased significantly. Numbers at stake are vast, with loss carry-forwards as high as 25% of GDP in some countries. Though most of these claims are justified, some corporations find loop-holes and use ‘aggressive tax planning’ to avoid taxes in ways that are not within the spirit of the law.</p>
<p>This aggressive tax planning is a source of increasing concern for many countries and they have developed various strategies to deal with it. Working cooperatively, countries can deter, detect and respond to aggressive tax planning while at the same time ensuring certainty and predictability for compliant taxpayers. <br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/61/0,3746,en_2649_33767_48570813_1_1_1_1,00.html"><em>Corporate Loss Utilisation through Aggressive Tax Planning</em></a> [report is gated], which builds on <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/48/0,3746,en_21571361_44315115_45944752_1_1_1_1,00.html"><em>Addressing Tax Risks Involving Bank Losses</em></a> (2010), looks at a number of commonly used schemes and identifies three key risk areas: corporate reorganisations, financial instruments and non-arm’s length transfer pricing.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p>David Cay Johnson <a target="_blank" href="https://research.tdwaterhouse.ca/research/public/Markets/NewsArticle/1314-N1E78021O-1">presents his interpretation of the data</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>The latest evidence of this tax after-the-factism comes from an eye-popping global tax avoidance study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p>
<p>What makes the study by tax authorities in 17 major countries so astonishing is not just the size of the losses, but when they were booked.</p>
<p>Country after country showed corporate losses equal to a 10th or more of an entire country&#8217;s economic output.</p>
<p>In Germany, corporations list 576.3 billion euros of tax losses on their books one year, equal to one quarter of German economic output that same year. What matters there is not just the stunning size of these losses, but also that they were booked before the global meltdown. The German data are from 2006.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I don&#8217;t understand my fellow US citizens.  Many commenters will note that they told me that I didn&#8217;t since I don&#8217;t live in the USA, but I didn&#8217;t when I lived there.</p>
<p>After the jump I try and fail to make sense of the latest <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/A_Politics/_Today_Stories_Teases/Correct_NBCWSJ_poll.pdf">NBC/WSJ poll</a>.</p>
<p>The nickel summary is that I thought that Obama should propose stimulus based on tax cuts not spending increases, because spending won&#8217;t be increased, high spending is unpopular, and there is no point paying a political price for a proposal which congress will reject anyway.  Then the people say they want more spending (and lower deficits).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>OK so look at Q34 what should the jobs proposal include.</p>
<p>The second most popular option (after the Georgia like program of subsidize hiring of long term unemployed for 8 weeks) is infrastructure spending with a 47% saying its a good idea and only 26% saying its a bad idea.  Continuing to cut the payroll tax rate gets 40 vs 20.   Yes only 40 % of US adults think it is a good idea to cut their taxes !?! </p>
<p>Strange. But what is much stranger is comparing Q34 in which a huge majority support hiring subsidies and a plurality support all the other deficit increasing proposals and responses to Q28</p>
<p>Which of the following two statements comes closer to your point of view? (ROTATE STATEMENTS) </p>
<p>Statement A: The president and the Congress should worry more about boosting the economy even though it may mean larger budget deficits now and in the future.  <br />38%<br />Statement B: The president and the Congress should worry more about keeping the budget deficit down, even though it may mean it will take longer for the economy to recover. <br />56%</p>
<p>Now the question does suggest that stimulus increases budget deficits &#8212; this is only true if the balanced budget multiplier is zero which no one but Robert Lucas asserts (one of the few ways to fail my intro macro course is to assert that one can stimulate with spending increases or tax cuts but not with spending increases financed by tax increases).  It also adds &#8220;in the future,&#8221; which is true only if one assumes that spending is increased not just pulled forward (accelerating maintanance which will be needed sooner or later) or that there is no long lasting effect of unemployment on the unemployed (hysteresis).  That&#8217;s an &#8220;or&#8221;  but the first is a simple point and everyone believes in hysteresis (even if very few know what the word means).  But on the other hand, the question asserts (correctly but controversially) that austerity will slow recovery.  </p>
<p>Why do people hate deficits so much ?  They do even if they are told that deficits are good for the economy (which they are only during the rare periods when the economy is in a liquidity trap).  Why do they advocate focusing on the deficit and policies designed to increase the deficit ?</p>
<p>Before going on, there is no majority American.  Most people gave consistent answers but enough flipped to change a solid majority for austerity into a plurality for every kind of stimulus under consideration.  What might they be thinking ?</p>
<p>I think part of what is going on is that Government spending is unpopular in the abstract but popular in the concrete (and asphalt) .  One way to reconcile the answers of those who flipped is that they want to cut foreign aid by 20% of the Federal budget and increase infrastructure spending by 5% of the Federal budget.  It is hard to understand the policy proposals of people who don&#8217;t know what current policy is (foreign aid is about 0.7% of the budget).</p>
<p>Another is that they really really want to soak the rich &#8212; to stimulate without adding to the deficit by paying for it with higher taxes on the rich.  Then if told this won&#8217;t happen (it won&#8217;t) they don&#8217;t want stimulus at all.  I think the best policy would be to stimulate a lot and soak the rich, so I hope I have company (although I think that deficit financed stimulus is almost as good).  But I doubt it.</p>
<p>Also the voters blame Republicans yet generic Republican is ahead of Obama and the Republicans are ahead on the generic congressional ballot.  It is just weird.</p>
<p>But again, the penny summary is that I was totally wrong about the most politically effective jobs speech.  Obama should call for infrastructure spending.  He was right and I was wrong (he has more pollsters than I do).</p>

                                <p>The standard model of Economic Development is Romer’s (1989, JPE 1990) adaptation* of Solow’s (1956, 1957) Model.  Basically,<br />

<p><img alt="Y=AK^aL^{1-a}\," src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/8/1/481e35d4e18ad0ca6715fd78d109e75e.png"></p>

<p>became</p>
<blockquote><p>Y = AK<sup>α</sup>(HL)<sup>(1-α)</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where the H stands for “human capital,” which multiplies the ability of labor. (Think high-skills labor—construction work, plumbing, teaching—where the worker continually “learns by doing” [op cit., Arrow, 1962]. The additional “human capital” multiples the effect of the labor.</p>
<p>One central question is how much of α is attributable to capital and how much is attributable to labor.  Standard Macroeconomics and Economic Development courses teach varying values for α, ranging from around 25% to about 1/3 (33.3%): that is, the mixture is between 3 and 4 parts of Labor to every one part of Capital.</p>
<p>How does the compensation go?  Well, not quite that way:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-PysKeU2Pmzw/TmVL_rVfokI/AAAAAAAAAh4/nB1bAuxL2e8/s1600-h/COE%25255B3%25255D.png"><img title="COE" border="0" alt="COE" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-bnXdQM5N2wM/TmVL_7BiAtI/AAAAAAAAAh8/o0NtNlO8Abs/COE_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="443"></a> </p>
<p>The banded area is the estimate of actual allocations of capital and labor.  The bars show the compensation to labor (and, therefore, the area above that to 100% are the portion of GDP that is being allocated to capital).</p>
<p>Economic theory tells us that if something is receiving excessive rents—as capital is clearly doing in the United States—there is suboptimal growth occurring across the economy. The standard method of adjusting for that is to reduce the excessive rents through either the introduction of competition (preferred if possible) or through taxation and redistribution.  Following are the tax rates on Capital v. Labor:</p>

<p>Note also that labor is not necessarily allowed to exclude its “depreciation” above the value of the “standard deduction” ($8,500 for an individual, $11,600 for a married couple). This is clearly a skewed incentive, with preferable tax treatment given to the overvalued resource (capital) at the expense of the undervalued one (labor).</p>

<p>This post is the fourth in a series that looks at the relationship between real economic growth and the top individual marginal tax rate.  The first looked at the period from 1901 to 1928, the second from 1929 to 1940, the third from 1940 to 1950.  This week we look at 1950 &#8211; 1968.</p>
<p>Before I begin, a quick recap&#8230;  both the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1901 &#8211; 1928 period</a> and the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_22.html">1929 &#8211; 1940</a> failed to show the textbook relationship between taxes and growth.  In fact, it seems that for both those periods, there was at least a bit of support for the notion that growth was faster in periods of rising tax rates than in periods when tax rates were coming down.  In the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_29.html">1940 &#8211; 1950</a> period, we did observe slower economic growth following a tax hike and faster economic growth followed a tax reduction.  However, that happened when the top marginal tax rate was boosted above 90%.  </p>
<p>There were also a few other findings that might be surprising given the poor acquaintance Americans have with data.  For example, the so-called Roaring 20s were a period in which the economy was often in recession.  The New Deal era, on the other hand, coincided with some of the fastest economic growth rates this country has seen since reliable data has been kept.  Additionally, rather than leading to faster economic growth, the economy actually slowed, a lot, during World War 2.  </p>
<p>Real GDP figures used in this post come from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis.</a>  Top individual marginal tax rate figures used in this post come from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a> [<strong>link fixed</strong>].  As in previous posts, I’m using growth rate from one year to the next (e.g., the 1980 figure shows growth from 1980 to 1981) to avoid “what leads what” questions. If there is a causal relationship between the tax rate and the growth rate, the growth rate from 1980 to 1981 cannot be causing the 1980 tax rate.</p>
<p>Now that the preliminaries are done, if I was following the same pattern I followed in other posts I&#8217;d post a graph showing real GDP growth rates and tax rates.  But this time I&#8217;m going to hold off on that graph for a few more paragraphs.  Instead, I want to discuss an extremely pervasive myth about the period, and how that affects our understanding of economic of the era.  The myth involves the so-called Kennedy Tax Cuts.  Ask most economists and they&#8217;ll tell you:  the economy was in the doldrums until Kennedy cut taxes from 91% to 70%.  After that shot in the arm, growth took off like a shot.  There is a second myth, but it is more confused:  the myth of the idyllic 1950s.  That one says that there was rapid growth in the 1950s because the US had little economic competition, what with the rest of Free World haven&#8217;t been destroyed during World War 2.  It doesn&#8217;t reconcile that well with the Kennedy tax cut myth since, of course, for the Kennedy tax cuts to pull the economy out of the doldrums caused by a 91% tax rate, the economy has to be in the doldrums rather than idyllic when tax rates are 91%.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s look at what happened.  The graph below shows growth rates for the period.  (I&#8217;m not including tax rates quite yet&#8230; that comes later.)</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-M5qkVx3U4PE/TmPGSAVaPoI/AAAAAAAAAhs/Tb4FR3mYmC0/s1600/Figure%2B1%252C%2B1950%2B-%2B1968.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-M5qkVx3U4PE/TmPGSAVaPoI/AAAAAAAAAhs/Tb4FR3mYmC0/s320/Figure%2B1%252C%2B1950%2B-%2B1968.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Well, growth rates in the 1950s weren&#8217;t steady.  There were a lot of ups and downs.  During three years in the 1950s, growth rates equaled or exceeded those in Reagan&#8217;s best year.  But it was also a period in which in which there were two recessions (and two more between 1945 and 1950, and another one in 1960) and the economy actually shrunk in two different years.  The 1950s can&#8217;t be characterized as idyllic nor as the doldrums. </p>
<p>Now, there is a point in the graph that seems consistent with the idea that Kennedy did something that was a game changer.  Kennedy took office in January 1961, while the economy was going through the downward part of the cycle we had seen repeated since 1950.  And then&#8230; instead of the economy continuing on its downward trajectory, growth picked up and accelerated (with one blip), staying (mostly) above 5% through about 1965.  LBJ of course, took office when JFK was shot on November 22, 1963 so in this version of history, presumably, the end of the Kennedy boom came about when LBJ started inflicting socialism on us.  The only fly in that ointment to that story, of course, is that while hitting the same growth rate as Reagan achieved in his best ever year was not uncommon in the 1950s when the top marginal tax rate was 91%, it stopped happening after JFK.</p>
<p>Which is all well and good, except for one detail apparent in the graph below which shows both the growth rate and the tax rate:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1-BrR5tPmVg/TmPGSdrckAI/AAAAAAAAAh0/Moagrbe0Sqw/s1600/Figure%2B2%252C%2B1950%2B-%2B1968.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1-BrR5tPmVg/TmPGSdrckAI/AAAAAAAAAh0/Moagrbe0Sqw/s320/Figure%2B2%252C%2B1950%2B-%2B1968.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As figure 2 shows, the cut in the top marginal rate occurred in 1964 (91% to 77%) and 1965 (77% to 70%).  Yes, the Kennedy tax cuts were pushed through by LBJ after Kennedy was dead, and  growth rates had already been fast and getting faster for several years before they occurred.  Worse, real growth in the 1960s reached their peak &#8211; the acceleration that had begun years earlier all of a sudden came to a halt &#8211; when the tax cuts occurred.  For the remainder of LBJ&#8217;s term, growth remained strong, but not as strong as it had been earlier.  For instance, the average of the annual growth rates of the 1961 to 1962, 1962 to 1963, and 1963 to 1964 years when tax rates were 91% was 5.41%.  The average from 1966 to 1967, 1967 to 1968, and 1968 to 1969, after the tax rates were dropped was 3.49%.  (Yes, I know, in his last year LBJ raised tax rates back to 75.25%, but even then it was well below the 91% before the tax cuts.)  </p>
<p>This is not, repeat, remotely consistent with the myth I keep hearing about the Kennedy tax cuts.</p>
<p>So far in this series&#8230;  it seems the evidence has been at least weakly against the idea that tax cuts lead to faster economic growth in the 1901 &#8211; 1928, 1929 &#8211; 1940, and 1950 &#8211; 1968 periods.  The 1940 &#8211; 1950 period does seem to behave consistently with that notion, though it is worth noting that it happened when tax rates were above 90%.  Next post in the series:  1968 &#8211; 1980.  </p>

                                <p>Spencer came home from vacation and found downed trees and lines and sporadic wifi connections he attempted in the neighborhood.  His report will have its own timetable this week.  I found <a target="_blank href=" http:>Michael Konczal&#8217;s take at New Deal 2.0</a> useful.  There was certainly a lot of reactions to the information.</p>
<blockquote><p>Payroll data came in this morning showing zero net new jobs. Actually, it came in at +17,000 private payroll jobs, -17,000 public payroll jobs. The government continues to drop jobs, shedding around 600,000 since the beginning of the recession. This has become a major disaster that has increased the ranks of the unemployed and put downward pressure on demand at the worst possible time.</p>
<p> The terrible private payroll jobs numbers need to be taken into account along with two other worrisome signs. Firstly, in the previous two months job numbers were revised down, making the anemic recovery even worse. June dropped from 46,000 to 20,000 jobs created, and July went from 117,000 down to 85,000. The labor market is even weaker than we thought.</p>
<p> The second sign is that major indicators surrounding those who do have a job are weak. Let’s look at the total amount of hours worked in the economy, production and non-supervisory hours. The Bureau of Labor Statistics adds up all the hours worked in the economy and plots them on a graph, divided by a previous year to set a baseline. This is total hours worked in the entire economy, not hours per employee or anything like that. And that number declined in August:</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Rebecca Wilder</p>
<p> Recently we saw retail sales figures come out of <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SPRSRAY:IND">Spain</a>, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-31/german-july-retail-sales-remained-unchanged.html">Germany</a>, <a href="http://www.insee.fr/en/themes/info-rapide.asp?id=94&#038;date=20110901">France</a>, and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=PMIIASMS:IND">Italy</a>. Across Europe, the seasonally-adjusted pattern of real retail sales is diverging. </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xjFzyCLcP9o/TmAsrDBK5YI/AAAAAAAAD6w/8ho3kKexn-M/s1600/retail_sales.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xjFzyCLcP9o/TmAsrDBK5YI/AAAAAAAAD6w/8ho3kKexn-M/s400/retail_sales.jpg"></a>The chart above illustrates the real seasonally-adjusted and working-day-adjusted (for Europe) level of retail sales across key countries in Europe and the US (for comparison). The raw data is indexed to 2007 for comparison. Euro area retail sales closely track those of Germany, so I&#8217;ll speak to Germany alone in this post. The final data point for sales in Italy, France, and the euro area is June 2011, while that for Spain, Germany, and the US is July 2011. Finally, Spain&#8217;s retail sales are released on a working-day but not seasonally adjusted basis. I adjust the figures for seasonal factors using a simple Census X12 ARIMA algorithm in EViews. </p>
<p> German and French consumers are hitting the retailers, while Italian and Spanish consumers are cutting back. <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2011/06/retail-sales-and-fiscal-policy-in.html">In this post</a>, I argued that the timing of the second drop in Spanish retail sales (following the recession) eerily coincides with the outset of fiscal austerity in Europe. US retail trade has outperformed that in Italy and Spain since the 2009 trough. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />
 Spanish and US consumers have something in common: household saving rates fell in order to support retail shopping. In contrast to US consumers, though, Spanish consumers were forced to cut back both on retail spending AND savings. In Spain, there&#8217;s not enough income to increase retail spending and/or saving rates. </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TurtEwXBWyM/Tl_3Ui9cZLI/AAAAAAAAD6o/cBH_sRyu09M/s1600/saving_rates.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TurtEwXBWyM/Tl_3Ui9cZLI/AAAAAAAAD6o/cBH_sRyu09M/s400/saving_rates.jpg"></a>The chart illustrates household saving ratios (saving as a percentage of disposable income). Although the levels cannot be directly compared, since each are released in either gross or net form (net being gross ex depreciation), the trends are illustrative. Spanish saving plummeted since its peak in 2009. As of Q1 2011, the saving rate is already at the level <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/household-saving-rates-forecasts-2011_hssv-gr-table-2011-1-en">forecasted by the OECD</a> for all of 2011. </p>
<p> This is not going to end well. As the Spanish government <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/business/global/spain-debt-sale-precedes-vote-on-balanced-budget-amendment.html">struggles to meet its deficit target amid a battered economy</a>, it does so at the cost of the domestic saving rate. Households will be forced to draw down saving further as a share of income in order to facilitate the government&#8217;s deficit objectives. </p>
<p> This deflationary policy is NOT sustainable. </p>
