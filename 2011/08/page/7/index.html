                                <p>It&#8217;s that they are so <em>bad</em> at it.</p>
<p>At least they made clear that <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/08/01/debt_ceiling/index.html">Glenn Greenwald was correct</a> when he said the deal is <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/08/03/myths-and-facts-about-debt-ceiling-compromise">exactly what Obama wanted</a>:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Fact: President Obama laid out key priorities that had to be part of any deal. Those priorities are reflected in this compromise.</strong>&#8230;the initial down payment on deficit reductions does not cut low-income and safety-net programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Third, we set up a path forward that will put pressure on Congress to adopt a balanced approach. And finally, we raised the debt ceiling until 2013, ensuring that House Republicans could not use the threat of default in just a few months to force severe cuts in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. [emphasis theirs]</p></blockquote>
<p>Uh, yeah, about that &#8220;<a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/08/nobody-could-have-predicted-4">we protect Medicare shtick</a>.&#8221; Maybe you should try actually saying that <em>in public</em>, or <em>in negotiations</em>.</p>
<p>And they play with straw men:<br />
<blockquote><strong>when push came to shove, Republicans backed down on their key demands.</strong> For months, Republicans called for a budget that would have ended Medicare as we know it, made catastrophic cuts to Medicaid, or cut investments in education by 25 percent, clean energy by 70 percent and infrastructure spending by 30 percent. As if that wasn’t enough, they also demanded that we repeat this debt-ceiling crisis, just a few months from now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gosh, I feel so &#8220;protected&#8221; now. Instead, the White House agreed to cut <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/08/01/news/economy/debt_ceiling_students/index.htm">education</a> <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9OSOUMO0.htm">loans</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/03/epa-republicans-tea-party">sidebarred the EPA discussion until they can lose that</a> (h/t Mark Thoma) (having already <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/science/earth/26climate.html">surrendered on a &#8220;market-based&#8221; energy solution</a>), and had Goolsbee lying to Jon Stewart last night about how there will be a <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-august-3-2011/exclusive---austan-goolsbee-extended-interview-pt--2?xrs=share_copy">National Infrastructure Alliance</a> that will <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=1pm">work in the same manner as TARP</a>.</p>

Assuming he&#8217;s the Democratic nominee, which I do, I&#8217;ll vote for Obama, because the alternative will still&#8211;somehow&#8211;be worse. But I really can&#8217;t see how, in good conscience, I could defend the economic policies of a guy who has signed on to fiscal contraction in the midst of a major downturn. And that&#8217;s leaving aside the President&#8217;s apparent lack of understanding of the importance of bargaining from strength. So much for all that poker expertise he&#8217;s supposed to have.</p>
<p>What a shame.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>I got into this relationship without any illusions about who you were. I never listened when others told me that you were perfect. I never listened when some told me you weren&#8217;t worth my time. I got together with you because I believed in us. You and me. Somewhere along the way, you stopped caring. Somewhere along the line, you started believing in others more than you believed in me.</p>
<p>I loved you as a smart, principled man. I worked at this relationship. Even when we fought, I still sought out the good in you. Now, finally, after watching you have affair after affair, saying each time that it was just a one-time thing, I have to allow myself to feel bitter and angry and more than a little foolish. And I have to do that by myself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure many of my friends will be upset. &#8220;What are you going to do now?&#8221; they&#8217;ll say. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to date Mitt or Michele, are you?&#8221; What that implies is that I should <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/liberals-hate-the-debt-deal-so-what/2011/08/02/gIQA0AIsqI_blog.html">settle</a>, that I should compromise myself and my dreams just to keep us together. No one deserves that kind of power. And they never considered a third option between staying with you and being with someone else. They never considered that I could just be alone. </p>
<p>So this is a separation, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be dating again quickly. But I need a break. I need to remember why I loved you. I need to miss you. I need to see if I miss you. Sure, sure, you&#8217;ll say, I&#8217;m being a drama queen, that nothing has changed, that I don&#8217;t live in the real world, that everything you&#8217;ve done has been for me, that I just don&#8217;t understand what it&#8217;s like to live with the pressure that you have. No, but I have to live with the results of what you do. And after you&#8217;re done, in 2013 or 2017, you&#8217;ll still be a rich moderate conservative and I&#8217;ll still be a middle-class liberal trying his best to clean up all the messes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna pack up my stuff and head out now. I wish you well, truly, for everyone&#8217;s sake. But I think if there&#8217;s anything you can take away from this, it&#8217;s simple:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not me. It&#8217;s you.</p></blockquote>
<p>When even <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/08/i-am-no-longer-among-the-most-pessimistic-economists-in-the-room.html">Larry Summers gives up on you</a>, it&#8217;s time to pack your bags.  Which is undoubtedly what several of the more politically-aware appointees started doing around twenty-four hours ago, making getting anything done all the more improbable.</p>

<p>If you claim the Federal Reserve Board is an independent entity, why do you argue that &#8220;a higher inflation target is a political nonstarter&#8221; (even while conceding that &#8220;economists have argued, with some logic, that the employment picture would be brighter if the Fed raised its target for inflation above 2 percent&#8221;)?</li>

                                <p>To which some might be tempted to respond: &#8220;What fresh hell is this?!&#8221; Well it is an attempt to backfill some of the argument behind my last post on consumption vs accumulation in relation to investment and marginal rates.</p>
<p>A.V. Chayanov was an early Soviet era agricultural economist of enormous influence during his time. Unfortunately his empiricism ran afoul of Stalinist magical thinking, ultimately to be a non-Marxist economist proved to be literally fatal, five years into a sentence in a labor camp in Kazakhstan Chayanov was re-arrested in 1937 and shot the same day. His most important works were finally made available in English in 1966 under the title <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Theory-Peasant-Economy-V-Chayanov/dp/0299105741">The Theory of Peasant Economy</a>. The material is quite dense and has enough data tables, graphs and equations to make both Kimel and Spencer weep with joy and I don&#8217;t intend to summarize it here. But it did smash the idea that the typical peasant labor unit, aka the family, operated as an instrument of accumulation and/or had its labor maximally exploited. Instead even the most oppressed serfs of Czarist Russia had astonishingly high amounts of leisure time at most points in their life cycles and ramped their labor up and down to maintain fairly predetermined consumption targets. This required the highest level of labor intensity during early child rearing years when small children were from an economic position pure friction, but mostly this intensity was not maintained afterwards even though it would have meant higher levels of accumulation. In short the peasant household was not a profit oriented operation at all, efforts in that direction generally being ends directed, particularly in the form of setting up children as their own economic unit. All in all the data collected and analysis made by Chayanov does not support the theory of peasant economy common to western liberal economics in either its neo-classical or Marxist formulations, with the mismatch with the latter being ultimately fatal.</p>
<p>But what does this have to do with oxen? Well it turns out that reading Chayanov illuminated my understanding of English agricultural economy in the middle ages. More below the fold.<a name="more"></a><br />In 1086 after 20 years of consolidating control after his conquest of England in 1066 William the Conqueror commissioned the Domesday survey. In the course of this William&#8217;s commissioners accomplished something almost inconceivable for its time, a near total economic survey of the entirety of England that established down to the acreage the control, rent, and carrying capacity of every land holding as it was currently and in the time of his predecessor Edward the Confessor (William considering King Harold whom he defeated at Hastings to be an usurper). The information was compiled into two large books the Little and Great Domesday which rather miraculously survived down to our time and represent the oldest public record of England. The entire text is now available online as well as in translation in a Penguin addition. Lots of great stuff but I want to focus on one aspect, that of the typical peasant holding in relation to the plow team.</p>
<p>The great middle swatch of England between the County of Kent (which is a historical world unto itself) and Wales in the west and Yorkshire and Lancashire in the north was largely devoted to &#8216;open field&#8217; farming in which ownership to various strips were scattered between three or less often two large fields. The nominal unit of land ownership was the hide which served both as the basis for taxation and as a measurement for a specific area of land. Unfortunately for us that measure varied from place to place. The historical literature on the hide is vast and in places astonishingly bitter but at risk of stirring ghosts of historians past I am going to define it as roughly 60 acres. While landlords might measure their holdings in terms of hides it was the very rare tenant that would hold so much, indeed a substantial peasant would be lucky to hold a virgate or 30 acres, while half virgates (~15 acres) or bovates (~7.5 acres) might be more common. Now the word &#8216;bovate&#8217; derives from Latin &#8216;bos, bovis&#8217; meaning &#8216;ox&#8217; and was considered the minimum size needed for a peasant to maintain two oxen. But here is the key point. In traditional open field farming a plow team consisted of eight oxen drawing a single plow. The manpower needed to direct the plow consisted of two people, a plowman and a ox boy, one doing the heavy work of directing the plow itself, while the boy and mostly literally such just keeping the oxen moving along the furrow.  Okay all this is just Medieval English History 1, but few people seem to have drawn the conclusion that a collision of Chayanov and Domesday points you to.</p>
<p>If a typical peasant tenant holds a bovate and owns two oxen while a middling peasant might hold a semi virgate with four oxen and yet it takes eight oxen to make up a full team then cooperation is essential. Except for the rare virgater putting together a plow team means a cooperative effort between 2-4 peasants or in some cases more (Domesday has holdings only large enough for &#8216;half an ox&#8217; and in one case at least reports that there is half an ox there &#8216;ubi semi-bos&#8217;). But here is the kicker, since it only takes one adult plowman to operate the plow in any given day, this means the other 1-3 or more peasants are on any given day not working their own fields. Now some of this time is occupied by tilling the lords fields using the lord&#8217;s plows but as often as not such plowing services require the tenants to bring their own plows which of course is impossible if another tenant is using it at the time. All of which kind of blows to smithereens the long held construct of the peasant working at the plow from dawn to dusk. Not just because the typical plowing session lasted only half the day (the oxen needing the other half to graze) but because your typical peasant might only be faced with plowing duties every other day or four. Nor was plowing a round the year occupation, you plowed in preparation for planting or in some cases conditioning of the field, but for much of the year the fields were just growing their crops, at most needing some weeding or drainage maintenance.</p>
<p>Now obviously there were other tasks to keep peasants occupied but few if any so labor intensive as working a heavy plow. Which kind of up-ends our typical understanding of peasant life particularly as contrasted to that of the factory worker of 18th and 19th century England. Almost all economic literature I am aware of simply builds in the assumption that as onerous as the six day, 72 hour work week might have been, at least those workers were better off than the serfs of Czarist Russia, working as they did from dawn to dusk for merciless landlords. Well frankly neither the data painstakingly collected and analyzed by Chayanov from actual workers in Czarist times or the English evidence based on field sizes and plow teams from 11th century Domesday really fits that model very well. Moreover a look at the calender for rural England in the middle ages shows an astonishingly long list of &#8216;holidays&#8217; &#8216;feast days&#8217; and &#8216;Saint&#8217;s Days&#8217; when no work was performed at all.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am not suggesting that daily life in England or certainly Czarist Russia was exactly like Hobbiton in the Shire. Just that our common understanding of mud stained serfs working under the cruel lash of their overseers may be just the mirror image of that same fantasy. Reality as almost always being more complicated.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Ken writes that Ezra Klein has turned into a Fred Hiatt Jr.  I was inclined to differ.  As evidence, I considered linking to</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/to-govern-responsibly-the-white-house-will-need-to-negotiate-like-republicans/2011/07/11/gIQAljjorI_blog.html#pagebreak">To govern responsibly, the White House will need to negotiate like Republicans</a></p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t sound like Hiatt.  Then I got to the policy proposal </p>
<blockquote><p>The White House should announce that it won’t extend any of the Bush tax cuts and will instead insist on a Gang-of-Six-esque plan that cleans the code, lowers rates for everyone, and raises $2 trillion or more in revenue. If the GOP refuses, the tax cuts will expire, </p></blockquote>
<p>That sounds just like Hiatt.  My comments after the jump.  </p>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/08/02/286026/growth-raises-taxes/">Oh and also Matt Yglesias</a></p>
<blockquote><p>rapid GDP growth is a friend of progressive governance. This, in turn, is one reason why tax reform that closes loopholes in exchange for cutting rates could be such a useful idea.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree with this policy proposal.  What&#8217;s this about &#8220;lowers rates for everyone&#8221;,  that is, lower rates for the top 1% than Bush and the Republicans introduced.  Why ?  It makes no sense.  Also it is unpopular.  Most people in the USA want higher rates for the rich.  They also want to keep the mortgage interest deduction.    </p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid Klein has been drinking from the Washington Post water coolers .  Even very young very serious villagers agree that the 86 tax reform was the best thing evar &#8212; we need fewer loopholes and lower rates.   That&#8217;s why the economy has done so well since 86 while it did so poorly with top rates of 70% or higher.</p>
<p>In my view, the problem with letting Bush cuts expire on income over $250,000 is that Clinton rates on income over $250,000 were way too low.   Somehow it is agreed that, even as a bargaining proposal, a top rate higher than Clinton&#8217;s is unmentionable.  Why ?  There is overwhelming popular support for higher taxes on the rich.  There is no popular support for eliminating any major tax deductions.  </p>
<p>Now another thing we need right now is stimulus.  It is very hard to stimulate the economy when everyone in official Washington (including you) has decided that the issue to address is the deficit &#8212; which is too high.  However, it is possible.  If the tax code is made more progressive, aggregate demand increases (the propensity to consume is lower for the rich).  </p>
<p>I think the best policy now is to raise taxes on the rich *and* extend the payroll tax cuts *and* extend UI *and* do the making work pay tax cut again.  This will drive the Republicans crazy, but, hey they are already crazy and will not be able to risk arguing that taxes must be low especially for the &#8220;most productive job creators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Specifically on Yglesias, I genuinely don&#8217;t know if he is confident that lower rates cause faster GDP growth or if he thinks that closing loopholes causes faster GDP growth.  Somehow the idea that the combination of fewer deductions and lower rates is good has become so deeply implanted that the idea that no explanation of the logic or (absence) of evidence is needed.</p>

<p>Edward Harrison draws our attention to the euro area bond crisis: <a href="http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2011/08/spain-italy-belgium-yields-now-under-attack.html">Spain, Italy, Belgium yields now under attack</a>. I&#8217;d like to add to this thread by offering some illustrations of the polarizing of bond markets that&#8217;s coincident with the euro area bond crisis. (Notice I do not say currency crisis because it&#8217;s really the bond markets that are seething &#8211; the euro area, hence the currency, is thought to be relatively secure for now.)</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A9QP74NUXlk/TjiZ8NpK6pI/AAAAAAAAD3Q/SweXk4TJZo8/s1600/core_yields.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A9QP74NUXlk/TjiZ8NpK6pI/AAAAAAAAD3Q/SweXk4TJZo8/s400/core_yields.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Spain, Italy, and Belgium are breaking away from the &#8216;core&#8217;, Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Finland, and France. But if you look really hard, France is showing a fair bit of stress too; it&#8217;s underperforming the other core countries.</p>
<p>This is ironic. By attempting to stem broader contagion by ring-fencing Greece, Ireland, and Italy, euro area policy makers focused market attention on those countries too big to quickly ring-fence, i.e., Italy and Spain.</p>

<p><strong>Stop Acting Surprised</strong></p>
<p>It seems a lot of Democrats seem surprised that Obama is willing to give up on what they view as core principles.  On the Republican side, there seems to be an implicit understanding that pretending the economic mess and spending began under Obama&#8217;s watch, and thus the policies that they favor (most of which Obama has continued, whether they admit it or not) bear no responsibility for where we are today.  As a reminder that reality is what it is, even if memory is weak and feeble, I&#8217;d like to repost something <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/11/role-of-president-elect-before-jan-20.html">I wrote a few days after Obama was elected</a> in its entirety below:  </p>
<p><strong>Is Obama Starting Poorly?</strong></p>
<p>One of the things that worried me about Obama was that he (like McCain) supported the ridiculous bail-out bill. As <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/welfare-queen.html">I noted</a> when it passed, it wasn&#8217;t going to work, and the net effect would be this:<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;shady, undeserving characters will be enriched, young versions of the idiots who got us into the mess will launch successful careers (can you say &#8220;Kashkari&#8221;?), and the promised benefits to the American public, the schmucks footing the bill, will never materialize.</p></blockquote>
<p>We now know the banks are not loaning out money which was the thing this whole bail-out was supposed to accomplish, but Goldman, Welfare, Queen, &#038; Sachs (to borrow a term from Lambert Strether left at the previous post) has made out like the proverbial bandit, Kashkari&#8217;s career is made, and the American public would be better off being beaten with a stick than having to pay for this garbage. </p>
<p>Sure, the idea for this was rammed down everyone&#8217;s throat by the administration and Bernanke, but the Dem leadership guided it through, and Obama voted for the bail-out. To me, it was the financial equivalent of invading Iraq because Osama hit us on 9/11. I can understand that at the time, many people thought something absolutely positively had to be done. Even many smart people who aren&#8217;t crooks &#8211; just folks who are too decent to be cynical enough to anticipate what this administration will do when you let them, felt the gubmint had to act, and act fast. So I can understand Obama voting for this piece of $%^&#038;.</p>
<p>But, now that we know the thing not working, and Paulson isn&#8217;t even pretending it was intended to work as advertised, isn&#8217;t it time to pull the plug? Shouldn&#8217;t the President-elect be out there, demanding an end to this waste of money? Shouldn&#8217;t he be calling on Congress to pull back the money that hasn&#8217;t already been thrown away? Shouldn&#8217;t he be proposing some other alternative? (If the problem, as we were told a while back, is that banks aren&#8217;t loaning money, and they&#8217;re still not loaning money, why is it worse for gubmint to loan money directly to people and corporations that need it than it is for the gubmint to find all sorts of ways to help Paulson&#8217;s former employer?) Instead, there&#8217;s all this talk about spending even more money on even more undeserving people and companies in a wider variety of industries, and Obama is not saying anything to discourage any of this. </p>
<p>I understand that the man hasn&#8217;t even been inaugurated yet, and I stand by what I wrote not long ago &#8211; I&#8217;m willing to give him a chance. (Heck, I voted for him.) But this bodes ill. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Now, its been a few years, and we still have a problem.  There&#8217;s no demand.  Consumers are sitting on their hands.  Companies are sitting on their hands.  Banks are sitting on their hands.  Which leads to a second post I wrote <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/11/how-to-bail-out-economy-less-wrong-way.html">a few days later</a>, which I&#8217;m also reproducing in its entirety:</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>How To Bail Out the Economy &#8211; A Less Wrong Way</strong></p>
<p>Regular readers know I&#8217;ve had post after post explaining why a bail-out would be a bad idea and would not work, dating to long before the bail-out began. I predicted that the end result would be the further enrichment of some of the very folks who brought us this mess and junior versions of the same folks who were too young to get in on the original crime spree, but otherwise, we&#8217;d have nothing to show for the trillions that would get spent.</p>
<p>The supposed &#8220;rationale&#8221; for this bail-out is to make sure that companies that are willing and able to produce goods and services that consumers wish to purchase are able to do so, and that in turn consumers are willing and able to purchase goods and services that companies want to bring to market. The story line is that this can be accomplished by giving money to the financial sector, that sector of the economy that for the past few years has specialized in selling squirrel meat as fillet mignon. Give those talented folks some money to make up the massive losses pulled off in the past years and they will happily loan money to producers and consumers, we are told. </p>
<p>Its becoming obvious even to the likes of Henry Paulson that no matter how much money gets paid to Goldman, Welfare, Queen &#038; Sachs and Citi and Countrywide and the rest of &#8217;em, the &#8220;financial system&#8221; of old is gone forever. Compensating buyers of squirrel meat is more than enough burden on the taxpayer, but it seems we&#8217;re expected to make Goldman, Welfare, Queen &#038; Sachs whole for paying the exorbitant salaries of folks like Henry Paulson in the past, and the current and future generations of Henry Paulson to boot. Clearly this is not only a very, very, indirect way to keep companies producing and consumers buying, its also adding a bunch of layers of unnecessary expenses.</p>
<p>So&#8230; if the goal is to stimulate production and/or consumption, why not cut out the unnecessary layers of exorbitant expense? I&#8217;m not sure I see the reason for bailing out car companies, but say that was the goal for some reason. In that case, the government could simply buy a $20K car for every single American, every single one, and spend less than the $7 trillion that&#8217;s been committed so far. That&#8217;s well over 30 times as many cars as GM made last year. Worldwide. You could bet the car companies would tool up for this, and it would employ a lot of people, and it would stimulate the economy. Additionally, we&#8217;d all have another car thrown in. Sure, it might be a GM vehicle, but its still something, which is more than the nothing we&#8217;re gonna get from pumping it into the Goldman, Welfare, Queen &#038; Sachs black hole. Heck, it doesn&#8217;t have to be cars &#8211; the gubmint could simply commit to spending $20,000 on something, anything each of us picks. You could take your 20 G and spend it on a menu of American made options.</p>
<p> Preposterous, you say? Inflationary, you say? Jingoistic, you say? Sure, I say. Its a stupid idea and I don&#8217;t like it all. But I think its a much better idea than the current bail-out approach, which I think is worse than taking (for now) $7 trillion and setting it on fire. Giving the money to the likes of Henry Paulson&#8217;s former employer is simply rewarding bad behavior and sending the wrong message, not to mention preposterous, inflationary, and jingoistic.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>So&#8230;  <strong>to summarize a few things that seemed obvious to me a few years ago and yet which I&#8217;m finding today aren&#8217;t part of the narrative any more:</strong></p>
<p>1.  The government response to the problem began long before Obama took office.<br />2.  The government response to the problem wasn&#8217;t going to have any positive effect since it addressed a non-existent problem (i.e., poor decision making on on Wall Street) and didn&#8217;t address the actual problem (i.e., weak aggregate demand on Main Street).  <br />3.  The government response to the problem was going to have a negative effect since it was extremely costly.<br />4.  By the time of the 2008 election, the sitting administration had abandoned the rationale for the government response, but maintained that response regardless.<br />5.  By the time of the 2008 election, Republican and Democratic leaders, including Barack Obama, knew the sitting administration had abandoned the rationale for the government response and yet were continuing that response regardless, and nobody complained.</p>
<p>In a sane world, the folks who let things get where they are, including pretty much all our esteemed members of Congress and our esteemed President, would not be allowed to be involved in &#8220;solving the problem&#8221; now.  Most economists who had some input into the previous &#8220;solutions&#8221; or who cheerleaded for them would also be shown the door.  But that&#8217;s not where we are.  </p>
<p>The solution to our current mess is obvious, and was obvious a few years ago.  Equally obvious is that we won&#8217;t be going anywhere near that solution.  But if you&#8217;re wondering what the world would look like if we did follow the obvious solution, just remember&#8230;  the last time the economy took a tumble like this, and was further exacerbated by bad policy response was 1929-1932.  In 1933, four years after the proverbial doo doo first hit the fan, the correct policy response was finally implemented.  Real economic growth rates for ten of the next 11 years exceeded 5% a year.  Real economic growth rates for nine of the next 11 years exceeded 8% a year.  Real economic growth rates for five of the next 11 years exceeded 10% a year.  (Data <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls">here</a>.)</p>
<p>It has now been almost four years since the doo doo hit the fan this time around.  Does anyone expect we&#8217;re going to see that kind of performance  this time around?</p>

                                <p>Readers here will know more about the US federal government income statement than I. However, given the near ubiquitous deficit hysteria, I wanted to illustrate the truth about the budget deficit. The truth is, that deficit hysteria has been set in motion by A surge in government spending on items like unemployment compensation, food stamps, and other types of &#8216;support payments to persons for whom no current service is rendered&#8217; AND low tax receipts. Yes, long-term reform is needed; but my general conclusion is that the deficit hysteria is sorely misplaced.</p>
<p>First things first, the fiscal deficit &#8211; receipts minus net outlays as a % of GDP &#8211; is big. In June 2011, the 12-month rolling sum of net receipts (the budget deficit) was roughly 8.5% of a rolling average of GDP. This is down from its 10.6% peak in February 2010, but the level of deficit spending clearly makes some nervous.</p>
<p>Why should they be nervous about the &#8216;level&#8217; of the deficit? I don&#8217;t know, since recent &#8216;excess&#8217; deficits are cyclically endogenous. The chart below illustrates the spending and tax receipt components of the US Treasury&#8217;s net borrowing (see Table 9 of the <a href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/mts/index.html">Monthly Treasury Statement</a>). Weak tax receipts and big spending are driving the federal deficits (spending, as we will see below, has surged on items directly related to the business cycle).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vieS9T9mgKA/Tjh8m4EUA8I/AAAAAAAAD24/pV57iha5Ekw/s1600/deficit_breakdown.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vieS9T9mgKA/Tjh8m4EUA8I/AAAAAAAAD24/pV57iha5Ekw/s400/deficit_breakdown.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />READ MORE AFTER THE JUMP!<br /><a name="more"></a><br />In June, the 12-month rolling sum of tax receipts &#8211; mostly corporate and individual income taxes and social insurance and retirement receipts &#8211; was 15.6%, which is up from its 14.5% cyclical low in January 2010. On the spending side, net outlays in June 2010 were a large 24.2% of GDP and down just slightly from the 25.3% peak in February 2010.</p>
<p>Deficit hysteria should be more appropriately placed as &#8220;lack of jobs and tax receipts hysteria&#8221;. At this point, the budget could just as easily worsen as it could improve, given the fragile state of the US economy (see <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/08/forecast-update.html">Tim Duy&#8217;s recent post at Economist&#8217;s View</a>).</p>
<p>Why the wrong hysteria?</p>
<p>Reason 1. Taxes. Some would love to increase taxes &#8211; but the fact of the matter is, that tax receipts remain well below their long-term average of 18% of GDP. Tax receipts will not improve without new jobs since individual income taxes account for near 50% of total receipts.</p>
<p>Reason 2. The spending has been on cyclical items. </p>
<p>The best time to &#8216;worry&#8217; about government spending is NOT when the economy is barely moving.</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates the big ticket items of the monthly outlays &#8211; roughly 87% of total outlays. The broad spending components are listed in Table 9 of the <a href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/mts/mts0611.txt">Monthly Treasury Statement</a>. The long-term average shares of total spending are indicated in the legend.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mLbWzh6wWqs/Tjh_5-VFDsI/AAAAAAAAD3A/y4iHx9lNusI/s1600/spending_bigticket.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mLbWzh6wWqs/Tjh_5-VFDsI/AAAAAAAAD3A/y4iHx9lNusI/s400/spending_bigticket.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The items health, medicare, and income security (inc security) are all above their respective long-term averages. But spending on income security outlays is the only spending component to have broken its trend, i.e., surge. According to the GAO&#8217;s budget glossary (<a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05734sp.pdf">link here, .pdf</a>), this item includes the following cyclical spending:<br />
<blockquote>Support payments (including associated administrative expenses) to persons for whom no current service is rendered. Includes retirement, disability, unemployment, welfare, and similar programs, except for Social Security and income security for veterans, which are in other functions. Also includes the Food Stamp, Special Milk, and Child Nutrition programs (whether the benefits are in cash or in kind); both federal and trust fund unemployment compensation and workers’ compensation; public assistance cash payments; benefits to the elderly and to coal miners; and low- and moderate-income housing benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s spending on unemployment and food stamps that&#8217;s driving spending at the margin.</p>
<p>The same deal exists with the &#8216;smaller ticket items&#8217;. Of these <br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uf1PT7gZamI/Tjh_900F3BI/AAAAAAAAD3I/vh5Khf_3tCM/s1600/spendins_smallerticket.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uf1PT7gZamI/Tjh_900F3BI/AAAAAAAAD3I/vh5Khf_3tCM/s400/spendins_smallerticket.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>OK &#8211; so deficit hysteria is about, but it&#8217;s misplaced. One could argue for more, not less, spending to get the jobs growth, hence tax receipts, up.</p>

<div>In the comments to my post <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/reminder-from-obamas-february-2009.html">&#8220;A reminder from Obama&#8217;s February 2009 speech&#8221;</a>, there is the following:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;I guess it relates to the fake Obama they had made up in their heads,&#8230;&#8221; </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>This sums up the early comments to the post suggesting that those who trusted Obama have only themselves to blame.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I addressed that concept in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/11/obama-is-he-or-isnt-he-real.html">Obama, is he or isn&#8217;t he real&#8230;?</a>  In that post I presented transcripts of Obama&#8217;s speeches and responses to questions and then argued:   </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;Are those talking like Glen Greenwald correct in that people should not be surprised with Obama&#8217;s appointments? Maybe, but then based on the above Obama words, that would mean we (you and I) just plain have to approach our relationship with governing as suspect until proven otherwise. Unfortunately, that means we will always be a day late and a dollar short having never known at the time of the decision if we made the correct one because you can not go by what is said.&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I recommend people go and not only read the posting, but the comments.  (History is always fun to review.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>I concluded that posting with:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div> &#8220;Do you know what happens to a person when they can never get a straight, no hidden agenda answer from one they count on? They go nuts.&#8221;</div>

<div>This all speaks to the issue of growing our economy, because to promote distrust in a developed economy where 77% of our capital is intangible (via 2005 World Bank study) is to be destroying the prime driver of our growth. I wrote about the issue of were our true wealth comes from a few times.  For this posting I am drawing on<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/02/attention-republicansblue-dog.html"> Attention Republicans/Blue Dog Democrates: Tax cuts as stimulus work against your goal.</a></div>
<div>February 5, 2009.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>From the World Bank study:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>“An economy with a very efficient judicial system, clear and enforceable property rights, and an effective and uncorrupt government will produce higher total wealth.”</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I concluded:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div> &#8220;The republicans/blue dogs, and those helping them by lending their &#8220;professionalism&#8221;, think they are only effecting a political strategy. In truth, they are destroying the very basis for the wealth they desire. Their entire campaign for decades to discredit, to instill mistrust in the primary institution we have, the US (We the People) government, has been the primary cause to our economic decline. To increase the level of distrust is to decrease the available “intangible capital” which is 77% of our wealth generating power. &#8220;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Which brings us to what we just experienced with the debt ceiling issue.  It&#8217;s not just the resulting budget changes, it&#8217;s the overall cognitive change being made in the people regarding trust of our ability to access a candidate and make the choice that will produce the desired results.  Clinton, as for the Dems made the first blow to our trust with &#8220;triangulation&#8221;.  I can and have on my own gone back and read speeches and answers to questions by Clinton during his first run and it shows the same as I note regarding Obama in &#8220;is he or isn&#8217;t he real&#8221;.  Obama is (knowingly or not) bringing our trust close to death.   </div>
<div>Even the debt ceiling event is only the latest in a string of recent events that all drive an additional spike into the coffin of &#8220;trust&#8221;.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Last night on Racheal Maddow&#8217;s show, Chris Hayes, noted that we are now in a phase of governance where &#8220;created&#8221; crisis is the vehicle for results.  Yes, Shock Doctrine governance level II..  It was presented from the perspective that the conservative mind set is the one employing such a tactic.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Visit msnbc.com for <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/">breaking news</a>, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032507">world news</a>, and <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032072">news about the economy</a></div>
<p>
<div></div>
<div>  In my opinion, what he missed, and what makes this a unique form to this nation&#8217;s version of Naomie Klein&#8217;s  Shock Doctrine is that there are enough economically conservative minded people in the opposing party (democratic party in this case) that the ruse can be played out with a more believable presentation than if just one side is playing along.  Yes, both side play it differently, but would that not be expected based on the supposed &#8220;base party&#8221; paradigms?  At no time during any of these &#8220;crisis&#8221; did the primary players on the democratic side resist the crisis by calling it out.  Instead, they used it to get what the conservative faction of the party (a smaller faction since the last election) wants. These &#8220;wants&#8221; being very much inline with the republican non Norquist/Tea Party faction&#8217;s wants.  Commonly referenced as  Wall Street.  In the end, no one to blame&#8230;It was the crisis.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>This pattern has held true through out Obama&#8217;s current term.  In the latest example, the proposed budget from the house progressive caucus, the largest of the democratic party caucuses never was mentioned by the president.  Recall the single payer health insurance issue? </div>
<div></div>
<div>The issue for this posting is not the &#8220;wants&#8221;.  It is not about the resulting policy from the latest ruse played on We the People.  The prime issue, the issue always suggested, implied, bandied about, but never out and out confronted: Public Trust.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>This latest Obama/conservative policy process has brought us closer than ever to the demise of our economy and thus our democracy not primarily by the furthering of the financial disequilibrium, but by the perpetuation and enlarging of the perimeters of social order that will now be distrusted.  I think we have approached, if not completely included the full boundaries of American culture in that which is to be distrusted with the completion of this debt crisis event. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Sadly, I do not think Obama and those referred to as the &#8220;adults in the room&#8221; know what they have done.  Instead. as I stated above, they believe they are just &#8220;effecting a political strategy&#8221;. </div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are 2 versions of distrust.  First is the distrust nurtured by those who have made it a political tool of their strategy for political dominance, power and fortune.  It is the &#8220;&#8230;most dangerous words in the English language: I am from the government and I am here to help you&#8221;.  These people do not know that in essence their distrust is part of the ruse.  The other distrust is those who see the ruse, have acted via those they trusted only to find they can no longer be trusted.  I don&#8217;t believe one is worse than the other, but I do know having both means the solution will be slower in materializing.  In both cases those in power can not be trusted and those who know it, presently have no one in power to represent their solutions.  It serves to make the what is the solution clear, it does not server to make it any easier or quicker in coming. </div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>I do not believe this mode of operation is forever simply because we are not naturally selfish, self serving for survival sake creatures. We are not naturally so shallow in our collective thinking.  It is only in our isolated, individual thought that we can and will be shallow.  Of course this assumes that the concepts and application of virtual reality throughout our daily lives does not mutate us way from our natural self.   A big assumption considering &#8220;reality&#8221; is in the phrase &#8220;virtual reality&#8221; and the character dynamic is trust.    </div>

                                <p>Today a host of global purchasing managers indices (PMIs) reiterated that the global economy is slowing&#8230;.quickly.</p>
<p>Within 24 hours, <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-official-pmi-slips-to-507-in-july-2011-07-31">China</a>, the <a href="http://www.ism.ws/ISMReport/MfgROB.cfm?navItemNumber=12942">US</a>, and the <a href="http://www.markiteconomics.com/MarkitFiles/Pages/ViewPressRelease.aspx?ID=8369">euro area</a> all reported July PMIs falling toward the feared 50 (below which the manufacturing industry is contracting) &#8211; 50.7, 50.9, and 50.4, respectively. The UK PMI fell below 50 to <a href="http://www.markiteconomics.com/MarkitFiles/Pages/ViewPressRelease.aspx?ID=8369">49.1 in July</a>.</p>
<p>I would posit (and I believe that others have, too, <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/edwardhugh/">like Edward Hugh</a>) that this is directly related to Fed policy, specifically that of quantitative easing (QE).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JNmHD3tiZuA/TjbZ29TmJTI/AAAAAAAAD2w/kqgH80cygTU/s1600/global_pmis_chart.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JNmHD3tiZuA/TjbZ29TmJTI/AAAAAAAAD2w/kqgH80cygTU/s400/global_pmis_chart.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />READ MORE AFTER THE JUMP!<br /><a name="more"></a>The chart above illustrates the stated PMIs alongside the dates of a shift in the <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/pomo/display/index.cfm">Federal Reserve&#8217;s QE policy</a>. The shorter bars indicate those dates when the Fed ended QE and announced that it would reinvest maturing proceeds. On the other hand, the full bars illustrate the outset of QE.</p>
<p>Falling PMIs correlate with the end of QE. New QE correlates with a rebound in global PMIs. Given this correlation and the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/q2-us-gdp-report-just-terrible.html">latest GDP release</a>, I expect that talk of QE anew to surface.</p>
