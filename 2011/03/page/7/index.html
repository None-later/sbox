<p>We tax profs have a tendency to tell our colleagues that tax law should be a mandatory topic for all law students because there&#8217;s nothing that you do that has economic consequences for which tax law isn&#8217;t relevant.  Whether you are marrying or divorcing, having a baby or buying a home, there are tax considerations that you should know about.  If you are starting a business, depositing the proceeds of a theft in a bank, embezzling or gambling, there are tax considerations that you should know about.  If you are filing a tort action, there are tax ramifications.  If you own property, there are tax consequences.  If you work and earn a salary, there are tax consequences.  If you find a diamond in the street and keep it, there are tax considerations.  If  you get an &#8220;extreme makeover&#8221; home, there are tax consequences.  If your home is rented by tourists in town to see the Master&#8217;s Golf tourney, the tax consequences will vary tremendously if the tenants are there for only 10 days versus if they are there for three weeks, even if you live in the house every other day of the year.  And on and on.</p>
<p>Ted Seto, a tax prof at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, noted another interesting fact about tax law that relates to this claim.  He notes that many of the important laws in other fields that we tend to think of as just a part of the common law had their origins in&#8211;you guessed it&#8211;tax law.  The following is quoted with his permission:  <a name="more"></a> </p>
<p>
<blockquote>The<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_in_Shelley's_Case"> Rule in Shelley&#8217;s Case </a>was an anti-tax-avoidance rule. So was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_of_worthier_title">Doctrine of Worthier Title</a>. So was <a href="http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/30781/Quia-Emptores-Statute-of-as-discussed-in-Statutes-of-Westminster-England-1275-1285-1290">quia emptores terrarum</a>, the statute that, by accident, created modern Anglo-American property in the first place. And the <a href="http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/magna-carta.htm">Magna Carta</a>, which created the beginnings of Anglo-American democracy, was a tax cap agreement (sort of like Prop 13). It&#8217;s all tax, all the way down.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Medical Malpractice Reform: Truth in Advertising Needed (Part Three of Three</strong>)
<p>So in the first two articles we have addressed the historic effects of tort reform using Texas as an example, and subsequently we reviewed the effects of tort reform on so called “defensive medicine” practices, looking at both the effect of reform measures on physician/provider ordering patterns, as well as the possible effects on patient outcomes or mortality.    <br />Today, we are going to examine the last party in this carousel. The insurance agencies themselves. For starters, I wanted to examine if there was any sort of a relationship between malpractice premiums, and healthcare spending. So, using historic healthcare expenditure rates from the NHE database (CMS), I calculated the rate of healthcare growth, percentage wise, per year from 1995-2008. I then used an ISO database set to examine the growth in insurance premiums per year.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l9vhc4U8ScE/TXaVTWtb8BI/AAAAAAAAAjs/QRh9R2vXTQE/s1600/viewer.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l9vhc4U8ScE/TXaVTWtb8BI/AAAAAAAAAjs/QRh9R2vXTQE/s400/viewer.png" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As we can plainly see, there is no correlation, but out of sense of thoroughness, I even ran a simple regression.  <a name="more"></a></p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9gZD3Dgg4cFxt0aG59Z9vY2Ow1di80Vjduouv3M-7jKIxYS0q2eW66B7bKkC-fUbvhGv5h4kfpCgYJYyAPKmHpW2c_ZogzvTwmM5AUgxRcQetUUtYk0" width="523" height="439"><br />But with an R-Squared of 0.021, there is simply little correlation there.     <br />So what causes these random spikes in medical malpractice premiums? Well, according to the AIR (Americans for Insurance Reform) these are due to the economic cycles of insurers and to drops in investment income.     <br />Lastly, I visited this article, <a href="http://www.centerjd.org/air/TrueRiskF.pdf">http://www.centerjd.org/air/TrueRiskF.pdf</a>, which found:</p>
<p>1.     Inflation-adjusted payouts per doctor not only failed to increase between 2001 and 2004, a time when doctors’ premiums skyrocketed, but they have been stable or falling throughout this entire decade.</p>
<p>2.    Medical malpractice insurance premiums rose much faster in the early years of this decade than was justified by insurance payouts.</p>
<p>3.    At no time were recent increases in premiums connected to actual payouts. Rather, they reflected the well-known cyclical phenomenon called a “hard” market. Property/casualty insurance industry “hard” markets have occurred three times in the past 30 years.</p>
<p>4.    During this same period, medical malpractice insurers vastly (and unnecessarily) increased reserves (used for future claims) despite no increase in payouts or any trend suggesting large future payouts. The reserve increases in the years 2001 to 2004 could have accounted for 60</p>
<p>percent of the price increases witnessed by doctors during the period.</p>
<p>But the real devil, the real devil is in the loss ratios…I’m assuming that we are all familiar with the MLR discussions that raged over the past two years discussing what should be an allowable loss ratio for health insurance. Malpractice also has it’s loss ratios, and oh boy, are they favorable to the insurance industry. 61.1% is the average, in 2007, for the average loss ratios for malpractice insurance companies.  To put this another way as per the article: In 2007, medical malpractice insurer profit based just on insurance transactions, that is,just on the premiums they took in, was 24.6%. This was more than double the amount on insurance transactions for the entire industry (11.0%).</p>
<p>If I were a physician who paid my own malpractice, I would be livid over these figures. It is not as though there is a huge advertising market for medical malpractice insurance. 38.9 cents on every dollar are kept as almost pure profit. Surely, administrative costs cannot account for this. Add to this, this last nugget: Inflation-adjusted payouts per doctor not only failed to increase between 2001 and 2004, a time when doctors’ premiums skyrocketed, but they have been stable or falling throughout this entire decade.</p>
<p>It seems, that right now would be a great time to own a malpractice insurance firm. Too bad, that it isn’t so great for everyone else in healthcare.</p>

<p>I agree that, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/03/02/supreme-court-corporations-dont-have-personal-privacy-rights/">as the article at Raw Story says</a>, the decision is a striking contrast to the court&#8217;s ruling in Citizens United, which upended decades of campaign finance regulation, allowing corporations to spend unlimited amounts on political campaigns without having to identify themselves.</p>
<p>Some commentators are amused by the last sentence of the final paragraph of Roberts’ opinion in the case. The paragraph reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>We reject the argument that because “person” is defined for purposes of FOIA to include a corporation, the phrase “personal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) reaches corporations as well. The protection in FOIA against disclosure of law enforcement information on the ground that it would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy does not extend to corporations. We trust that AT&#038;T will not take it personally.</p></blockquote>
<p>The line strikes me as a nod to a hilarious Supreme Court Dispatch article that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2281715/">Dahlia Lithwick wrote in Slate</a>, reporting on the oral argument in the case in January, in which she treated AT&#038;T as an actual human and said “he” was in court that day to watch the argument. </p>
<p>But there’s really no mistaking that Roberts and some of the others are feeling burned by the massive criticism of the Citizens United opinion last year.</p>

<p><strong>Does the Tea Party Dislike Goodwin Liu?</strong></p>
<p>Politico had an article last week called <a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=A01558F9-D07C-414E-8DDB-DA9EBE6D4718">“Will Senate ever vote on Liu?”</a> Liu is Goodwin Liu, a prominent liberal Constitutional Law professor at the UC, Berkeley. His official profile at the U. is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=4360">here</a>.</p>
<p>Obama nominated him in 2009 to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the appellate court for the west coast states, Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii, and by far the largest of the federal appellate courts. His Judiciary Committee hearing was held more than a year ago, and the nomination was voted out of that Committee more than a year ago but was never brought to a floor vote because Republicans planned to filibuster it. Obama renominated him early this year, and his Committee confirmation hearing was held yesterday. The Politico article says this time the nomination will be brought to a floor vote but that his confirmation is unlikely.</p>
<p>The Politico article summarizes the controversy about his nomination:<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Liu, 39, has captured the hopes of liberals who see him as one of Obama’s few bold judicial picks, someone with the intellect and youth for the circuit court bench, a traditional stepping stone to the Supreme Court. But Republicans have argued that he lacks any judicial experience, his legal writings are proof of his intention to legislate from the bench, and his criticism of Supreme Court Judge Samuel Alito after he was nominated to the court revealed an inexperienced social activist who has no place on a federal bench.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article says the Democrats and the Obama administration blame Senate gridlock, generally, on judicial nominees for the Senate’s earlier failure to confirm Liu, but “Republicans have suggested that Democratic leadership had been unwilling to take time on the Senate calendar in order to entertain a lengthy floor debate about Liu’s positions on controversial issues like affirmative action and the death penalty.” </p>
<p>Apparently what offends the Republican senators the most about Liu is that he testified against Samuel Alito’s confirmation to the Supreme Court in 2006, saying that Alito’s record as a federal appellate judge suggested that he “envisions an America where police may shoot and kill an unarmed boy to stop him from running away with a stolen purse … where a black man may be sentenced to death by an all-white jury for killing a white man.” Liu has retracted the comment and apologized for it, and said yesterday in his opening statement that it “was not an appropriate way to describe Justice Alito as a person or his legal views.” </p>
<p>He’s probably right that that statement was not an appropriate way to describe Justice Alito as a person or his legal views. The statement was, after all, about Samuel Alito, not Clarence Thomas. But the fact remains that Alito, like Thomas, selects a (very) few constitutional rights that he votes to interpret broadly, almost always those that are part of the rightwing political agenda, circa 1985, and, like Thomas, votes to effectively decimate the other constitutional rights, certainly when it comes to the rights of criminal defendants, but also concerning the rights of others. (Unlike Thomas, Alito and his spouse haven’t claimed intellectual-property rights to “Liberty.”)</p>
<p>The Politico article quotes Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus as saying, “We will have to work very, very hard on his behalf and I know that Goodwin Liu is intending to meet with every senator that he can. I hope that through his one to one meetings people will see how reasonable and measured he is, and he can get enough support so that he can break through cloture.”</p>
<p>But Chu and the White House should focus their efforts as well on noting that Liu, unlike Alito, is a strong civil libertarian in most respects, not just the respects that rightwing ideology dictates, and certainly not just in the respects that Reagan-era rightwing ideology dictates. And although Washington has yet to recognize this, the two—Tea Party ideology and Reagan-era rightwing ideology—diverge significantly, at least in theory, on many legal issues, including concerning the issues that they really care about.</p>
<p>I mean, how many Tea Partiers really care one way or the other about the death penalty? Or, for that matter, about affirmative action? What they do care about is civil liberties, generally, not just a few select ones.</p>
<p>So moderate Republican senators who vote for cloture on Goodwin Lui’s nomination probably won’t be defeated by a Tea Party candidate in a primary election because of that cloture vote. If it’s mentioned at all, say in a TV ad by some private group (the Koch crowd, maybe?), the senator could simply respond that Liu is a libertarian. </p>
<p>And, if necessary, that Alito is almost entirely not.</p>

                                <p>Moody&#8217;s has downgraded its rating on Greek sovereign debt:<br />
<blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12664681">Greece debt rating cut further by Moody&#8217;s</a></strong></p>
<p>Moody&#8217;s has downgraded Greece&#8217;s debt to &#8220;highly speculative&#8221; prompting an angry response from the finance ministry. Greek bonds fell after the rating agency cut its rating from Ba1 to B1.</p>
<p>Moody&#8217;s cited &#8220;endemic tax evasion&#8221;, &#8220;very ambitious&#8221; austerity plans, and the possibility that the EU may force a debt restructuring on Greece after 2013 as reasons for its decision.</p>
<p>Greece&#8217;s finance ministry said the move was &#8220;incomprehensible&#8221; and called for tighter regulation of rating agencies. </p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, Moody&#8217;s downgrading of Greece&#8217;s debts reveals more about the misaligned incentives and the lack of accountability of credit rating agencies than the genuine state or prospects of the Greek economy,&#8221; said the Greek finance ministry in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having completely missed the build-up of risk that led to the global financial crisis in 2008, the rating agencies are now competing with each other to be the first to identify risks that will lead to the next crisis.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I have to say, I agree completely with the sentiments expressed here by the Greek finance ministry.  In my mind, the credit rating downgrades have become a lagging indicator of problems, and have demonstrated little or no predictive power.  Take a look at the chart below.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The blue line shows the interest rate spread on long-term Greek government bonds over the equivalent bonds issued by the German government.  The other two lines show the ratings assigned to Greek sovereign debt by S&#038;P and Moody&#8217;s since January 2008, normalized so that they&#8217;re on the same scale.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ynq0rZIZZ4A/TXT1tu4enII/AAAAAAAAAZ0/fItY69BB7XQ/s1600/greek%2Bdebt%2Bspreads1.PNG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ynq0rZIZZ4A/TXT1tu4enII/AAAAAAAAAZ0/fItY69BB7XQ/s400/greek%2Bdebt%2Bspreads1.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a>The question I ask myself is this: would paying attention to ratings have helped me make (or save) any money on Greek debt?  If we assume that the market is charging the Greek bonds a higher interest rate to compensate for the higher chance that the Greek government will default, then the interest rate spread is a rough measure of the market&#8217;s estimation of the likelihood of Greek government default.  The market seems to pay little attention to credit ratings, and if I had used the credit ratings as a cue to buy or sell Greek government bonds, I can&#8217;t see that it would have provided me with any benefit.</p>
<p>But this has become completely typical of credit ratings in recent years &#8211; just think about how badly they mis-rated a giant swathe of assets leading up to the financial crisis of 2008. All in all, I&#8217;m not quite sure why we should care about what rating Moody&#8217;s and S&#038;P assign to Greece&#8217;s sovereign debts &#8211; or any other debt, for that matter.</p>

<blockquote>In a Labor Day address in 1980, Ronald Reagan said:</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the values inspiring those brave workers in Poland … They remind us that where free unions and collective bargaining are forbidden, freedom is lost.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Reagan as above, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&#038;address=385x560345">in video.</a></p>

                                <p>by <strong>Mike Kimel</strong></p>
<p>Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=382">Presimetrics blog</a></p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t understand <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/03/canadian-data-on-income-stagnation.html#comments">this post by Tyler Cowen</a>.  He begins by noting:<br />
<blockquote>The median earnings of full-time Canadian workers increased by just $53 annually &#8212; that&#8217;s right, $53 annually &#8212; between 1980 and 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then links to two documents, one of which says <a href="http://spon.ca/canada-discovers-trickle-up-economics/2010/12/28/">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A more likely explanation is that the rich have used their clout to get governments in the United States, Britain and Canada to change the rules, redirecting economic benefits to themselves.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>They convinced governments, for instance, to alter the rules governing executive stock options, making them much more lucrative. (Although only about one-third of Canada’s top corporations were using stock options early in the 1990s, they were all were using them by the end of the decade. The value of stock options for Canadian CEOs exceeded their salaries by 300 per cent.)<br /><!-- more --></p>
<p>The rich also managed to use their control of corporate boards to push up executive compensation. Since corporate boards are largely made up of corporate executives, a decision to raise the salary of an individual CEO helps set a higher standard for executive pay generally, benefitting all board members.</p>
<p>“They have a conflict of interest, since they have a stake in high financial salaries,” notes Richard Posner, a critic of today’s executive compensation (and also, incidentally, the judge who recently turned down Conrad Black’s U.S. legal appeal).</p>
<p>The rich also greatly enriched themselves by convincing governments to lower their taxes. Whereas the top marginal tax rate — the rate paid on income above a certain level — averaged 80 per cent in Canada in the early postwar years; it is now just 46 per cent (39 per cent in Alberta).</p>
<p>It was argued that lower taxes would encourage better performances at the top, increasing overall economic growth.</p>
<p>But that didn’t happen. On the contrary, economic growth rates were higher in the early postwar years — roughly twice as high — as they’ve been since 1980.</p>
<p>This suggests that higher taxes on the rich — like those in the early postwar era — do not discourage economic growth.</p>
<p>In fact, the introduction of an inheritance tax in Canada (like ones that exist in almost all advanced nations) would enable Ottawa to collect enough revenue to create educational trust funds for all Canadian children, thereby significantly improving national productivity.</p>
<p>Yet anyone advocating higher taxes on the rich is quickly denounced by groups like the right-wing Fraser Institute. Mark Milke, a commentator with the institute, dismisses concerns about rising inequality in Canada as merely the product of envy, or what he calls the “green-eyed beast.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The very next sentence Cowen writes:</p>
<blockquote><p> This is one reason why I do not adhere to some of the progressive or &#8220;class struggle&#8221; explanations of relative stagnation in median income growth.  Canada is not ruled by the so-called Republican Right.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know enough about Canada to say whether or not the article he linked to is correct, but it seems to be directly contradicting his thesis.  </p>
<p>I note that his blog has a very, very healthy comment section, and it doesn&#8217;t seem like the folks leaving comments noticed anything amiss either.   Very odd.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Earlier this week <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/03/its-pretty-simple-ecbs-now-in-hiking.html">I argued</a> that the ECB&#8217;s inflation target of just below 2% is too simplistic, especially during periods of supply-side price shocks: energy, food, VAT hikes. Here&#8217;s a menu of reactions to the ECB&#8217;s announced rate hike (Trichet used the phrase &#8216;strong vigilance&#8217;, which <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/03/ecb-rates-trichet-idUSLDE7221LJ20110303">historically is a leading indicator of a rate hike</a> in the following month): <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/04/the-madness-of-jean-claude-trichet/">Paul Krugman</a> calls it &#8216;madness&#8217;; <a href="http://macromarketmusings.blogspot.com/2011/03/inflation-targeting-gets-another-black.html">David Beckworth</a> sports the &#8216;black eye&#8217; metaphor; <a href="http://kantoos.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/is-trichet-out-of-his-mind/">Kantoos</a> is somewhat more explicit in his language; <a href="http://moslereconomics.com/2011/03/04/eu-daily-europes-bank-signals-it-may-raise-interest-rates-to-tamp-down-inflation/"> and Warren Mosler</a> goes for the Disney theme.</p>
<p>And then I see that one of my favorite blogs, <a href="http://eurointelligence.com/">the Eurointelligence blog</a>, interprets the policy response as warranted in the face of an &#8216;overheating&#8217; export sector. <a href="http://www.eurointelligence.com/homepage/daily-morning-news-briefing/article/back-to-strong-vigilance-but-note-trichet-is-also-playing-politics.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=901&#038;cHash=1ebbfdafef6da9482285baa739d26d4f">From Eurointelligence</a>:<br />
<blockquote>(It is our interpretation that the ECB is very keen to drive up the euro’s exchange rate against the dollar to reduce the commodity price shocks, and to reduce the overheating in the export sector. This is why the ECB was keen to signal this interest rate as early as possible, to underline the transatlantic policy gap. We don’t think the ECB intends to hike interest rates to very high absolute levels, though we consider a 2% year-end rate realistic.)</p></blockquote>
<p>RW: My initial reaction was: what? Am I missing something here? Is the ECB right to be strongly vigilant? Is the export sector (1) overheating? and (2) therefore unmooring Eurozone inflation expectations?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Exhibit 1: Real exports are 1.5% below the pre-crisis level (1H 2008). No overheating there. Based on the chart below, whose data are <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database">from Eurostat</a>, I&#8217;d even argue that there is a possible stagflationary scenario on the horizon if investment doesn&#8217;t pick up.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h376iXe7f_Y/TXOUxES5mSI/AAAAAAAADgE/zVLxzsplgY0/s1600/gdp_chart.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h376iXe7f_Y/TXOUxES5mSI/AAAAAAAADgE/zVLxzsplgY0/s400/gdp_chart.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>If it&#8217;s not the export sector, perhaps it&#8217;s a broader impetus to prices driven by services and consumption goods. No.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Exhibit 2: The chart below illustrates the diffusion of HICP inflation (the ECB&#8217;s target inflation index, which is a consistent measure of inflation across the 17-member currency union). I calculate the diffusion index to measure the breadth of prices that are rising at a rate of 2%: > 50 and there&#8217;s a larger share of sub-components prices increasing at a greater than 2% annual rate, or <br />The breadth of Eurozone 2% price gains is very low, 31, or 31% below its historical average (45).</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6XFauk_wBq8/TXOdXI3_gsI/AAAAAAAADgk/67DNhl75zvY/s1600/inflation_diffusion.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6XFauk_wBq8/TXOdXI3_gsI/AAAAAAAADgk/67DNhl75zvY/s400/inflation_diffusion.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />We know that headline inflation is estimated at <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-01032011-BP/EN/2-01032011-BP-EN.PDF">2.4% in February</a>, or about 0.4% above the ECB&#8217;s comfort zone &#8211; perhaps that&#8217;s passing through to inflation expectations.</p>
<p>Exhibit 3: The chart below illustrates near-term Eurozone inflation expectations, as measured by the 5-yr inflation swap. (Note: and inflation swap is a market security that allows an investor to hedge against inflation by paying a fixed rate and receiving inflation-linked interest payments in exchange). According to the swap market, inflation expectations are priced at 2.151%; this appears well-anchored especially compared to the 2007 period when it drifted upward.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_dQD3UTYUoM/TXOYJZy8LBI/AAAAAAAADgU/XWO2wWIfaGg/s1600/5-yr%2Bswap%2Bindex.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_dQD3UTYUoM/TXOYJZy8LBI/AAAAAAAADgU/XWO2wWIfaGg/s400/5-yr%2Bswap%2Bindex.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Another measure of inflation expectations, the ECB&#8217;s Survey of Professional Forecasters, sees inflation peaking in <a href="http://www.ecb.int/stats/prices/indic/forecast/html/table_3_2011q1.en.html">2011 at 1.9%</a>. No unmooring of inflation expectations there.</p>
<p>Related to the chart above, perhaps the ECB is looking at the sharp upward trajectory of inflation expectations in the swap market since October 2010 as unhealthy. No. That trajectory in inflation expectations is just a re-emergence of <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2010/12/whats-behind-recent-treasury-yields.html">normalized inflation expectations</a>, as the Fed worked to re-establish the US price trajectory. Global inflation expectations turned from drifting downward to a trend rate. Then perhaps it&#8217;s that Eurozone inflation expectations are outpacing those in other developed economies. Again, no.</p>
<p>Exhibit 4: The chart below illustrates the 5y5y forward break even rates of inflation for the US, UK, and the Eurozone, which is from <a href="http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/mobu/mb201102en.pdf">page 84 of the ECB&#8217;s February (yes, this month) monthly Bulletin</a>. The Eurozone is definitely the laggard here!</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--Tp8vNGWEfs/TXOZRXf74ZI/AAAAAAAADgc/sLSIHbD3Ezg/s1600/ECB_m2_chart.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--Tp8vNGWEfs/TXOZRXf74ZI/AAAAAAAADgc/sLSIHbD3Ezg/s400/ECB_m2_chart.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>My interpretation of these statistics &#8211; and yes, there are <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=9099">many ways to measure inflation</a> &#8211; is that the ECB is overreacting to the inflation pressures coming from commodity prices, energy prices, and VAT hikes. The liquidity squeeze is afoot.</p>

<p>1. Is a 7-8% return reasonable to expect (smoothed over time) in the future?<br />2. If a different system is used from here on out? what are appropriate transitions?&#8230;Felix compares to 401k plans as being totally inadequate but there are other proposals.<br />3. What about the question of buyouts?<br />4. Interestingly several of the commenters were using the MA teachers retirement system as an example, which makes it useful for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/03/ma-teacher-retirement-system-and-wi-bit.html">AB post here</a>.<br />5. What are the incentives inherent in the current system?  (ie. most value is actually &#8216;accrued&#8217; in the last five (?10) years of acummulated contribution for a pensioner?  Not unlike any plan based on yearly contributions over decades. <br />6. The meme of baby boomers/versus younger contributors was brought forward but without numbers&#8230;this also could be subsumed under #2 and #3.<br />7.
