<blockquote><p>&#8230;What happens to the participation rate is an important question. If the Civilian noninstitutional population (over 16 years old) grows by about 2 million per year &#8211; and the participation rate stays flat &#8211; the economy will need to add about 100 thousand jobs per month to keep the unemployment rate steady at 8.9%.</p>
<p>If the population grows faster (say 2.5 million per year), and/or the participation rate rises, it could take significantly more jobs per month to hold the unemployment rate steady. As an example, if the working age population grows 2.5 million per year and the participation rate rises to 65% (from 64.2%) over the next two years, the economy will need to add 200 thousand jobs per month to hold the unemployment rate steady.</p>
<p>That is why forecasting the participation rate is important &#8211; and why reports of the number of jobs needed to hold the unemployment rate steady are all over the place (and can be very confusing &#8211; and I&#8217;m guilty of using different numbers).</p>
<p>Here is a look at some the long term trends (updating graphs through February 2011)&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Worth a visit this weekend.  It also points to questions regarding other types of policy questions for planners.</p>

                                <p>{Cross posted from dkos Social Security Defenders Group}</p>
<p>If we back up a bit and examine Social Security absent the lenses of the various economic and ideological stakeholders, it is clearly not in crisis. But it does face challenges, or at least one challenge viewed three different ways.</p>
<p>The challenge is stated pretty simply: under current law and current intermediate economic and demographic projections Social Security&#8217;s income from all sources is projected to fall short of costs under the scheduled benefit in the late 2030s. But that is the last point of agreement in this debate and even that overstates the confidence in those projections. But &#8216;Intermediate Cost&#8217; is at least a common point of departure.</p>
<p>The basic challenge as stated assumes that the assets in the Trust Fund both as to principal and interest will be available as income and will serve to backfill tax revenue until assets are depleted, after which current law mandates that benefits be cut to match then current revenue. Which under current projections means a 22% cut compared to the baseline. But this is where views of the challenge diverge dramatically, and so suggestions of what to do about it. Wonkery below the fold.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Supporters see the challenge as the cut in benefits itself and so frame solutions in the of better outcomes after 2038. That is one challenge.</p>
<p>One the other hand one group of critics see the problem as being in the benefit schedule itself which they see as overgenerous and so frame solutions in terms of keeping future retirees from demanding a 100% of schedule result, even as they may not openly advocate the 78% result current projections give us.</p>
<p>Which puts the two solution sets in dynamic opposition, with supporters wanting to drag 78% up and critics wanting to drag 100% down.</p>
<p>But a second, overlapping set of critics see the challenge in more immediate terms, for them the problem is paying down the current obligations of the Trust Funds, which in their more charitable public moments they express in terms of avoiding crowding out other spending, but in their more candid moments is revealed to be our old friend tax avoidance.</p>
<p>Which is why Republicans are in a box. There is no question that Trust Fund assets are a legal obligation under current law and backed by Full Faith and Credit, legalistic arguments that they have no real economic value, or that one part of government can&#8217;t &#8216;really&#8217; owe another part, or appeals to Flemming v Nestor running into rock of law and historic and current practice, in fact the Disability Insurance Trust Fund is busily cashing in large chunks of its principal as we speak, just as both Trust Funds did throughout the 70s until the Funds went to near zero in 1982.</p>
<p>The box takes form. While it is reasonable to make the economic case that the projected scale of Trust Fund asset redemption on a year to year basis at some point becomes so onerous that it makes sense to stretch it out, that would require actual numbers for the years 2011 to 2037. Because for this group a policy of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; simply brings forward their own &#8216;Tax Freedom Day&#8217;, for them Trust Fund Depletion is the equivalent of burning the mortgage, while any cuts in benefits prior to 2037 just extends the life of the Trust Fund and so their payments. Their only total escape is to cut benefits and shift taxes downward so dramatically that they never have to pay anything back, and so in effect abrogate the Trust Funds completely. Which gives them a teensy problem of buy-in, particularly if the end result results in a worse than 78% outcome that a policy of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; provides.</p>
<p>Because 78% provides a kind of lower bound here and &#8216;reformers&#8217; are faced with supplying numbers that show that in real terms their &#8216;Something&#8217; provides a better real outcome for the grandchildren they profess to be worried about.</p>
<p>We know what it would cost right now if we left the system untouched and filled the projected gap by tax increases on people earning under the current cap schedule. We have the numbers and the dollars per week per worker and remarkably it turns out to be couch change, and CBO has confirmed the numbers of similar tax based plans. Or we could agree to split the difference and only take an 89% solution. But any solution that doesn&#8217;t provide a 78% plus outcome on net for those future taxpayers and retirees across the board should be rejected.</p>
<p>Graham made an appeal to that 78% number as something to be avoided, yet there is no plan currently on the board that delivers a better result for workers at a lower cost than &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. Maybe they can sell a straight out proposal to &#8216;reform&#8217; Social Security by cutting benefits so as to fund tax cuts for billionaires and just be willing to take the political heat a naked CBO score would supply. But I don&#8217;t see it, which is EXACTLY they attempted to sneak Social Security into some packaged &#8216;Grand Compromise&#8217; via the Catfood Commission and now the C.R. and Debt Limit showdowns, and why the Dems move to build a wall of separation this week are so important.</p>
<p>Because if they want a straight up and down fight over the economics and financing of Social Security based on actual cost and outcomes for a huge majority of Americans, we got the numbers and they just don&#8217;t. They were just hoping that people wouldn&#8217;t understand that in the Republican dictionary &#8216;shared sacrifice&#8217; means &#8216;workers sacrifice, capitalists take shares in the result&#8217;.</p>

Total payroll employment rose 192,000 and private payroll employment rose 222,000&#8211; one of the strongest this cycle. Moreover the household survey reported employment gains of 250,000.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eHjcjnW_zyc/TXD4X0GZMMI/AAAAAAAABio/5zsKmdaUbbQ/s1600/Clipboard08.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eHjcjnW_zyc/TXD4X0GZMMI/AAAAAAAABio/5zsKmdaUbbQ/s320/Clipboard08.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Part of the strength obviously was just a make up for the very weak gains in January because of the weather.  The two months combined do not really represent much of a break in trend.  This is apparent in the unemployment rate which only fell from 9.0% to 8.9%.<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-beYycf-CJk0/TXD6H5c7lnI/AAAAAAAABjQ/7ueMYLnxuOc/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-beYycf-CJk0/TXD6H5c7lnI/AAAAAAAABjQ/7ueMYLnxuOc/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>The hours worked show the same slow trend.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KIrfXG41VgE/TXD4g76w30I/AAAAAAAABiw/_yAyjXeVb2w/s1600/Clipboard09.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KIrfXG41VgE/TXD4g76w30I/AAAAAAAABiw/_yAyjXeVb2w/s320/Clipboard09.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>Moreover, average hourly earnings growth remains subdued.  Wage growth may be trying to bottom, but any earlier evidence that it is starting to accelerate has disappeared.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-F3hJK06rAWc/TXD4KmYvB3I/AAAAAAAABiY/GnHhlo1Bp0o/s1600/Clipboard05.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-F3hJK06rAWc/TXD4KmYvB3I/AAAAAAAABiY/GnHhlo1Bp0o/s320/Clipboard05.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>Moreover, average weekly earnings growth remains weak.  With income growth this weak fears of significantly higher inflation appear to be misplaced.  Although headline inflation may be ticking up because of food and energy,  the weak income growth implies that the impact of higher food and oil prices will be felt much more in weak consumer spending rather than higher inflation expectations.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-phGHqrUoOdY/TXD4RNczMAI/AAAAAAAABig/xuD_Yt4y3JE/s1600/Clipboard06.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-phGHqrUoOdY/TXD4RNczMAI/AAAAAAAABig/xuD_Yt4y3JE/s320/Clipboard06.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The basic trend that employment is doing better than in the last two jobless recovery but poorly compared to what happened in earlier cycles before the great moderation does not seem to have changed regardless of how bullish this employment report may seem.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qSvaUgI2kTo/TXD9w8wb24I/AAAAAAAABjw/HMuV6yH6KKA/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qSvaUgI2kTo/TXD9w8wb24I/AAAAAAAABjw/HMuV6yH6KKA/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>I recognize that labor force growth has slowed and that over the long run the old labor force growth of some 2% can not be sustained.  But it is still informative to compared the recent results compared to the old trends.</p>

Not great, but okay.

(e-mail slightly revised for clarity)</p>
<p>by <strong>Beverly Mann</strong>
<p>Clarence and Ginny Thomas, the Go-To Folks for Liberty</p>
<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>I’m obviously very supportive of the political goals of both of the organizations whose web sites you’ve pointed me to and asked my opinion about concerning their efforts against Clarence Thomas.  But the petition demanding impeachment of Thomas for ruling in favor of Citizens United because in 1991 that organization sponsored television commercials urging Thomas’s confirmation by the Senate strikes me as ridiculous. And not just because the House, which would have initiate an impeachment process and then vote articles of impeachment, is in Republican control.</p>
<p><em>The problem with Thomas’s participation in the Citizens United case isn’t that the organization that filed the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of some of the McCain-Feingold election-law restrictions happened to be Citizens United. Citizens United actually challenged a regulation in that law that had nothing to do with campaign contributions. It was the Court itself (the five-member majority, obviously) that reached out on its own to address the constitutionality of the restrictions on corporate campaign contributions. </em><br /><a name="more"></a><br />The problem is that Koch Industries, the most prolific and pervasive of corporate campaign contributors in federal and state election campaigns, and the Koch brothers, were huge players in this controversy. The purpose of the Koch campaign contributions is to affect the outcome of elections in order to affect enactment, repeal or enforcement of a vast array of environmental laws and regulations that impact their immense oil, gas, manufacturing, ranching, finance and commodities trading businesses. (I got those listings from Wikipedia.) Scalia and Thomas attended and spoke at Koch-sponsored four-day law conferences at luxury resorts. Their expenses were paid by the rightwing bar group, the Federalist Society, which receives substantial donations from Koch Industries and which may have actually received dedicated funds for those expenses from Koch Industries. If so, Scalia and Thomas may not have known of this.</p>
<p>In any event, the decision by these two to participate in the Citizens United decision is not an impeachable offense. What might be an impeachable offense, in my opinion, is Thomas’ failure to comply the disclosure statute; he lied on his disclosure statement, for at least six years, in what I think is a significant respect. As I wrote last week, that may violate a criminal statute, although that is not my area of expertise and I don’t know whether it does or not. And if it does, I hope he is eventually prosecuted for it.</p>
<p>The information that Thomas withheld was that his wife was paid a very substantial amount of money during those six years by rightwing interests. Comments he made in a speech at a Federalist Society function last weekend hint, if I understand the comments correctly, that he withheld that information in contravention of federal statute as part of what he considers his and his wife’s crusade for Liberty in the name of the Constitution, and that he believes—and he made this clear in that speech, as the speech was reported—that he and his wife are the True Arbiters of the meaning of that word as the Constitution intends it; no one else need apply. They are the liberty messiahs, so they are entitled to violate the law, and certainly ethics codes, in the service of their holy mission. And make no mistake. This is a holy mission.</p>
<p>Here are quotes from a <a target="_blank" href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=98FB7622-57C3-4BBF-8F77-83BDD2822C8F">Politico story about the speech</a>:</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Thomas spoke in vague, but ominous, terms about the direction of the country and urged his listeners to “redouble your efforts to learn about our country so that you’re in a position to defend it.”   <br />He also lashed out at his critics, without naming them, asserting they “seem bent on undermining” the High Court as an institution. Such criticism, Thomas warned, could erode the ability of American citizens to fend off threats to their way of life.    <br />“You all are going to be, unfortunately, the recipients of the fallout from that – that there’s going to be a day when you need these institutions to be credible and to be fully functioning to protect your liberties,” he said, according to a partial recording of the speech provided to POLITICO by someone who was at the meeting.    <br />“And that’s long after I’m gone, and that could be either a short or a long time, but you’re younger, and it’s still going to be a necessity to protect the liberties that you enjoy now in this country.” …
<p>At one point Thomas recognized his wife in the audience and suggested she was being targeted for her beliefs, telling the audience, according to the recording, “my bride is with me, Virginia Thomas. And some of you may know her. But the reason I bring that – specifically bring it – up is there is a price to pay today for standing in defense of your Constitution.”</p>
<p>Thomas said his wife “started her organization to give 24/7 every day in defense of liberty,” and said he shared her principles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>Yes, that’s right. Thomas thinks it’s his critics who seem bent on undermining the Court as an institution and that could erode the ability of American citizens to fend off threats to their way of life.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I WAY underestimated the simplicity of ECB policy. I think that the terse <a href="http://www.ecb.int/mopo/html/index.en.html">monetary policy objective</a> explains quite well the ECB&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ecb.int/press/pressconf/2011/html/is110303.en.html">announced stance </a>on policy today:<br /><em><br />
<blockquote><em>The primary objective of the ECB’s monetary policy is to maintain price stability. The ECB <strong>aims at inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term</strong>.</em></p></blockquote>
<p></em><br />Today the ECB announced that it would keep the refi rate unchanged at 1%, however, Trichet made it quite clear that rate hikes at the next meeting cannot be ruled out (rather should be ruled in). The market response was pretty strong: bond markets are now pricing in 75 basis points of rate hikes this year, which would take the refi rate to 1.75% by the end of 2011; the euro&#8217;s close to breaking the 1.40 mark; and the 2-year yield is 13 basis points higher on the day.</p>
<p>The trigger, in my view, was the ECB&#8217;s increased <a href="http://www.ecb.int/press/pressconf/2011/html/is110303.en.html">inflation projection</a>:<br /><em><br />
<blockquote><em>The March 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 2.0% and 2.6% for 2011 and between 1.0% and 2.4% for 2012.</em></p></blockquote>
<p></em><br />The fact that the ECB is now projecting 2012 inflation upwards of 2.4% , which exceeds by leaps and bounds their 2% target in &#8216;ECB talk&#8217;, implies that the committee sees the medium-term outlook on inflation as seriously biased toward the upside. For the ECB, this means policy is way too accommodative.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Let&#8217;s step back a moment, though. Despite the &#8216;strong&#8217; growth in the Eurozone, Germany, the largest Eurozone economy, has not fully recovered it&#8217;s GDP lost during the recession. As of Q4 2010, GDP remains 1.4% below its 2008 peak.</p>
<p>In my view, the ECB&#8217;s policy objective is too simplistic. During times of supply-side inflation shocks to food and commodities (i.e., wheat droughts or Middle East unrest), headline inflation overestimates the true impetus to prices.</p>
<p>Core and service prices are still very muted, while it&#8217;s goods prices that&#8217;s driving the price spikes.</p>

Better put: the Eurozone remains overly exposed to global growth shocks.</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>In a January 2009 ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos, then President-elect Barack Obama said fixing the economy required shared sacrifice, &#8220;Everybody’s going to have to give. Everybody’s going to have to have some skin in the game.&#8221; (1)   <br />For the past two years, American workers submitted to the President’s appeal—taking steep pay cuts despite hectic productivity growth. By contrast, corporate executives have extracted record profits by sabotaging the recovery on every front—eliminating employees, repressing wages, withholding investment, and shirking federal taxes. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The global recession increased unemployment in every country, but the American experience is unparalleled. According to a July OECD report, the U.S. accounted for half of all job losses among the 31 richest countries from 2007 to mid-2010. (2) The rise of U.S. unemployment greatly exceeded the fall in economic output. Aside from Canada, U.S. GDP actually declined less than any other rich country, from mid-2008 to mid 2010. (3)</p>
<p>Washington’s embrace of labor market flexibility ensured companies encountered little resistance when they launched their brutal recovery plans. Leading into the recession, the US had the weakest worker protections against individual and collective dismissals in the world, according to a 2008 OECD study. (4) Blackrock’s Robert Doll explains, “When the markets faltered in 2008 and revenue growth stalled, U.S. companies moved decisively to cut costs—unlike their European and Japanese counterparts.” (5) The U.S. now has the highest unemployment rate among the ten major developed countries. (6).</p>
<p>The private sector has not only been the chief source of massive dislocation in the labor market, but it is also a beneficiary. Over the past two years, productivity has soared while unit labor costs have plummeted. By imposing layoffs and wage concessions, U.S. companies are supplying their own demand for a tractable labor market. Private sector union membership is the lowest on record. (7) Deutsche Bank Chief Economist Joseph LaVorgna notes that profits-per-employee are the highest on record, adding, “I think what investors are missing &#8211; and even the Federal Reserve &#8211; is the phenomenal health of the corporate sector.” (8)</p>
<p>Due to falling tax revenues, state and local government layoffs are accelerating. By contrast, U.S. companies increased their headcount in November at the fastest pace in three years, marking the tenth consecutive month of private sector job creation. The headline numbers conceal a dismal reality; after a lost decade of employment growth, the private sector cannot keep pace with new entrants into the workforce. </p>
<p>The few new jobs are unlikely to satisfy Americans who lost careers. In November, temporary labor represented an astonishing 80% of private sector job growth. Companies are transforming temporary labor into a permanent feature of the American workforce. UPI reports, “This year, 26.2 percent of new private sector jobs are temporary, compared to 10.9 percent in the recovery after the 1990s recession and 7.1 percent in previous recoveries.” (9) The remainder of 2010 private sector job growth has consisted mainly of low-wage, scant-benefit service sector jobs, especially bars and restaurants, which added 143,000 jobs, growing at four times the rate of the rest of the economy. (10) </p>
<p>Aside from job fairs, large corporations have been conspicuously absent from the tepid jobs recovery. But they are leading the profit recovery. Part of the reason is the expansion of overseas sales, but the profit recovery is primarily coming off the backs of American workers. After decades of globalization, U.S. multinationals still employ two-thirds of their global workforce from the U.S. (21.1 million out of 31.2 million). (11) Corporate executives are hammering American workers precisely because they are so dependent on them. </p>
<p>An annual study by USA Today found that private sector paychecks as a share of Americans’ total income fell to 41.9 percent earlier this year, a record low. (12) Conservative analysts seized on the report as proof of President Obama’s agenda to redistribute wealth from, in their words, those ‘pulling the cart’ to those ‘simply riding in it’. Their accusation withstands the evidence—only it’s corporate executives and wealthy investors enjoying the free ride. Corporate executives have found a simple formula: the less they contribute to the economy, the more they keep for themselves and shareholders. The Fed’s Flow of Funds reveals corporate profits represented a near record 11.2% of national income in the second quarter. (13)   <br />Non-financial companies have amassed nearly two-trillion in cash, representing 11% of total assets, a sixty year high. Companies have not deployed the cash on hiring as weak demand and excess capacity plague most industries. Companies have found better use for the cash, as Robert Doll explains, “high cash levels are already generating dividend increases, share buybacks, capital investments and M&#038;A activity—all extremely shareholder friendly.” (5) </p>
<p>Companies invested roughly $262 billion in equipment and software investment in the third quarter. (14) That compares with nearly $80 billion in share buybacks. (15) The paradox of substantial liquid assets accompanying a shortfall in investment validates Keynes’ idea that slumps are caused by excess savings. Three decades of lopsided expansions has hampered demand by clotting the circulation of national income in corporate balance sheets. An article in the July issue of The Economist observes: “business investment is as low as it has ever been as a share of GDP.” (16)</p>
<p>The decades-long shift in the tax burden from corporations to working Americans has accelerated under President Obama. For the past two years, executives have reported record profits to their shareholders partially because they are paying a pittance in federal taxes. Corporate taxes as a percentage of GDP in 2009 and 2010 are the lowest on record, just above 1%. (17)</p>
<p>Corporate executives complain that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world, but there’s a considerable difference between the statutory 35% rate and what companies actually pay (the effective rate). Here again, large corporations lead the charge in tax arbitrage. U.S. tax law allows multinationals to indefinitely defer their tax obligations on foreign earned profits until they ‘repatriate’ (send back) the profits to the U.S. U.S. corporations have increased their overseas stash by 70% in four years, now over $1 trillion—largely by dodging U.S taxes through a practice known as “transfer pricing”. (18)Transfer pricing allows companies to allocate costs in countries with high tax rates and book profits in low-tax jurisdictions and tax havens—regardless of the origin of sale. U.S. companies are using transfer pricing to avoid U.S. tax obligations to the tune of $60 billion dollars annually, according to a study by Kimberly A. Clausing, an economics professor at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. (18)</p>
<p>The corporate cash glut has become a point of recurrent contention between the Obama administration and corporate executives. In mid December, a group of 20 corporate executives met with the Obama administration and pleaded for a tax holiday on the $1 trillion stashed overseas, claiming the money will spur jobs and investment. In 2004, corporate executives convinced President Bush and Congress to include a similar amnesty provision in the American Jobs Creation Act; 842 companies participated in the program, repatriating $312 billion back to the U.S. at 5.25% rather than 35%. (19) In 2009, the Congressional Research Service concluded that most of the money went to stock buybacks and dividends—in direct violation of the Act. (20)</p>
<p>The Obama administration and corporate executives saved American capitalism. The U.S. economy may never recover. </p>
