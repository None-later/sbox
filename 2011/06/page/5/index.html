                                <p>Brad DeLong, not generally a Leading Indicator in such matters, follows <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/06/the-unemployment-crisis-continues.html">Mark Thoma yesterday</a> in looking into the abyss and <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/very-short-reading-list-unemployment-in-the-1930s/">seeing the outline of a train around the &#8220;light&#8221;</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Henceforth, I will call the current unpleasantness not &#8220;The Great Recession,&#8221; but rather &#8220;The Little Depression.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This still strikes me as optimism, but I&#8217;m stil on what do you call 1873-1896 (much more similar to the current situation) when &#8220;The Great Depression&#8221; only lasted about 17 years?</p>

                                <p>&#8230;it seems that way, at least, when I listen to much of the rhetoric coming out of Washington.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not just Washington, it&#8217;s Wall Street, too. In my line of work, finance, market participants grapple with the monthly economic data flow, eyeing each release as if it&#8217;s telling a new story about the current prospect for US economic growth &#8211; that it isn&#8217;t <em>just</em> treading water. &#8216;Consensus&#8217; economists forecast their expectations for the economic release of the day, the market then trades based on the surprise to which the data beat or disappointed expectations. Day in, day out, that&#8217;s what we do.</p>
<p>I have a problem with this automated way of viewing the world. It&#8217;s tough to hear Wall Street economists defend their forecasts, stating that &#8216;oil&#8217; or &#8216;Europe&#8217; are the primary risks to the outlook; or that the structural unemployment rate has risen markedly so that harmful inflation is right around the corner. Step back, take a look at where 2.7% annual growth (current Consensus for 2011) actually gets the US labor market (see chart below).</p>
<p>The biggest risk to the outlook is not oil, it&#8217;s unemployment. The longer that the labor market remains idle &#8211; in fact, the labor force is now <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?id=CLF16OV">trending downward </a> &#8211; the lower will the average skill level will go. Then you&#8217;re going to get something much more structural, the so-called positive feedback loop.</p>

<p>People move to the US for the American Dream &#8211; I wonder where they&#8217;ll go now&#8230;. Germany?</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bLujc76JzUg/TfIFYmUwbpI/AAAAAAAADqo/GiKzqILJf7E/s1600/G7_urate.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bLujc76JzUg/TfIFYmUwbpI/AAAAAAAADqo/GiKzqILJf7E/s400/G7_urate.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The chart above illustrates the harmonized G7 unemployment rates indexed to 2007 for comparability. The latest readings (June mostly) are listed in the legend.</p>
<p>The US labor market, as measured by the unemployment rate, deteriorated much more precipitously than that in any other G7 country. Germany stands out as the sole labor market that&#8217;s shown any marked improvement, furthering a trend that started with the the Hartz Concept. (I just did a Google search of the Hartz commission and came across this <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/1292407">Economist article written in 2002</a> &#8211; remarkable.)</p>
<p>Policy drives the structural level of unemployment, not the other way around. In the US, there are currently no true boundaries to the supply of labor, rather it&#8217;s demand. Congress should be targeting job creation and aggregate demand, not the 2012 elections.</p>
<p><a href="http://curiouscapitalist.blogs.time.com/2010/04/05/whats-worse-high-unemployment-or-inflation/">Stephen Gandel</a> is right: there is no upside to high unemployment, just downside. You want to drop the deficit? Create jobs and aggregate demand so that the population &#8216;can&#8217; pay taxes.</p>

<p>The link to the ACA litigation blog article I discuss is <a target="_blank" href="http://acalitigationblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/regulated-activity.html">here</a> .</p>
<p><strong>‘Markets’ and the ACA: Why the Supreme Court Will Uphold the ACA</strong> </p>
<p>In my post last week about the activity/inactivity canard on which the challengers to the constitutionality of the ACA claim, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In his [blog] post, [high-profile rightwing law professor Randy] Barnett pointed out something that was not in the other reports I’d read about [last month’s oral arguments in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals]: that in a lengthy exchange with [acting Solicitor General Neal] Katyal, [Judge Diana Gribbon] Motz indicated that she buys the activity/non-activity distinction, because she believes the definition of the word “regulate” means “regulate activity.”  She kept insisting that if the failure to buy health insurance is inactivity rather than activity, then, under her understanding of the definition of the word “regulate,” Congress couldn’t regulate it. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Katyal flubbed the response to this.  Partly.  He noted the Supreme Court’s most recent relevant Commerce Clause/Necessary and Proper Clause decision, <i>Gonzales v. Raich</i>, a 2005 opinion that held that the federal statute enacted under the Commerce Clause powers that criminalizes the growing and use of marijuana applies even to homegrown marijuana that is not sold even intrastate, much less in interstate commerce, and that is just for the personal use of the grower.  The rationale: that even those actions impact the interstate market for marijuana.  Since the Commerce Clause gives Congress the authority to regulate interstate markets, Congress can, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, regulate things that otherwise cannot be regulated under the Commerce power if those things impact the interstate market.  </p>
<p>Motz, though, missed the point. Growing marijuana is an activity, she pointed out, so how is Raich relevant to whether Congress can, under the Commerce Clause together with the Necessary and Proper Clause, regulate inactivity, she wanted to know?  Well, um, maybe that what’s relevant isn’t the particular reason why the Commerce Clause alone isn’t enough and must be aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, but instead that if something—whether activity only within a state’s boundary, or instead inactivity, or instead whatever—impacts a market that Congress has the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate, then Congress has the constitutional authority to regulate it as necessary and proper under the Commerce Clause.<br />Katyal apparently was too dumbfounded to explain this.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power, in the Constitution’s precise words, “To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” It’s one of the “enumerated,” or specified, powers that the Constitution gives Congress, and which the Necessary and Proper Clause augments.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, Santa Clara U. law professor Brad Joondeph, who has a blog called “aca litigation blog,” wrote trenchantly as the opening paragraph of a lengthy post titled “The regulated activity”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Much ink has been spilled over whether Congress&#8211;using its commerce power alone, or its commerce power in conjunction with the Necessary and Proper Clause&#8211;has the authority to regulate &#8220;inactivity.&#8221; But there is a logically prior question&#8211;a question that is often quite tricky in enumerated powers cases&#8211;that must be resolved before reaching the inactivity issue. Namely, one has to define exactly what conduct Congress is regulating in the challenged provision.</p>
<p>[A] critical question that every judge must confront (or at least every judge reaching the merits) is whether the minimum coverage provision (a) regulates conduct in the <i>health insurance</i> market (as the challengers contend), or (b) regulates conduct in the <i>health care services</i> market (as the United States maintains).</p>
<p>In a direct and immediate sense, of course, the individual mandate regulates behavior in the insurance market. But one can easily argue (as with §4306 above) that what it <i>really</i> regulates is the payment for services in the health care service market. Sure, the provision, when examined in isolation, only directly concerns the purchase of health insurance. But the broader scheme, taken as a whole, shows that what Congress was actually regulating&#8211;of which the individual mandate is only a part&#8211;is the financing of health care services. Congress logically cared whether people carry health coverage not for its own sake, but due to its implications for the financing of services in the health care market, the ultimate object of its regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>So which is it? Which market does the minimum coverage provision actually regulate?</p>
<p>The larger point, he says, is that</p>
<blockquote><p>the relevant “regulated activity”—or, phrased differently, the relevant regulated market—is quite open to debate [and that the] fact that the challenged provision only regulates a particular activity directly (… the decision whether to acquire health insurance in the case of the ACA) does not answer the question. The regulated activity or market, for purposes of evaluating whether the challenged provision is within Congress&#8217;s enumerated powers, may well be different than the conduct that the provision <i>directly</i> governs. Answering the critical question is not as simple as examining the empirical realities of the challenged provision by itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s spot-on.  But I think it would be profoundly disingenuous for any judge to say that the relevant market is simply the health insurance market.  The purpose and the effect of the ACA, including the mandate provision, clearly is to regulate the method by which healthcare is funded in this country.  </p>
<p>Joohdeph ends his post by saying that the distinction between regulation of the market for health insurance and regulation of the market for healthcare is “obviously of enormous importance.”  He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>For if the relevant market is only that for health insurance, the minimum coverage requirement looks truly unprecedented (and constitutionally problematic). But if the relevant market is that for health care services, then what Congress is regulating is a market in which virtually every American <i>actively</i>participates&#8211;and the minimum coverage provision is merely regulating the <i>commercial terms</i> on which thatactive participation occurs. And this framing, of course, makes it seem well within Congress&#8217;s authority to regulate interstate commerce.</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s right, but only if, as he says earlier, the market for health insurance is defined so narrowly that health insurance is viewed as a commodity, a product, independent of the product’s purpose and effect.  And then, the constitutional issue would not, I think, be whether Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause, aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, to regulate the health insurance market, but instead whether this violates some other constitutional limitation.  You know: the slippery-slope-to-government-compelled-consumption-of-broccoli argument.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Supreme Court is unlikely, in my opinion, to say that the relevant market is health insurance rather than healthcare.  That would pretty much require them to do what they did in <i>Bush v. Gore</i>: pronounce the ruling good for that case only.  Which is why I think the ACA will survive the constitutional challenge.  But if it doesn’t, it’s likely to be one a 5-4 slippery-slope-to-government-compelled-consumption-of-broccoli ruling. </p>
<p>&#8212;-  </p>
<p>The most important of the ACA-case appellate arguments is tomorrow afternoon in Atlanta, at the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.  This is the appeal in the case in which 26 states and one private organization are the plaintiffs, and in which the trial-level judge, Roger Vinson, held the entire ACA unconstitutional because, he said, the mandate is too essential to the entire statute to strike that provision down without also striking down the entire ACA.  Paul Clement, who, it was announced today, will be representing Arizona in defending the constitutionality of the most draconian of Arizona’s recently enacted immigration-law statutes, and who is representing six Republican House members in defending the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, is the states’ lead attorney.  (Looks like a pattern here, for Clement.)</p>

<p>Continuing my <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/monetary-policy-im-sorry-its-just-not.html">prior post</a> suggesting that what ever monetary policy has done, it has not reached that vast majority nor has it addressed what is the main issue, I viewed <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PPMC1yThA7s/Te2CxHdeVII/AAAAAAAAAok/JpU9l8iU52s/s1600/Figure_1stagnation.bmp">this chart</a> by Mike Kimel and thought: Perfect!<br />Then comes Ken Houghton linking to <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/06/08/were-halfway-to-a-lost-decade/">this article</a> with it&#8217;s chart. <br />What do they have in common? Income inequality. So let me repost <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/its-big-one-honey-i-know-it.html">this graph</a> from my 12/2007 post.<br />I&#8217;m only posting the second half of the graph, as that is the one that matters. </p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g-5O6E53JmA/TfD-FYlVwUI/AAAAAAAAARE/q0txm5D_CnA/s1600/Bottom+99%2525+income+vs+outlays+63+-+05.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="197px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g-5O6E53JmA/TfD-FYlVwUI/AAAAAAAAARE/q0txm5D_CnA/s320/Bottom+99%2525+income+vs+outlays+63+-+05.JPG" t8="true" width="320px"></a></div>
<div>Take a look at 1996. That is the year that personal consumption crossed over the income level of the bottom 99%. It&#8217;s been borrowed money ever since. For an economy that runs on making money from money, that&#8217;s not a problem for those who earn their income by such a manor, is it?</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div></div>
<div>Back to Mike&#8217;s chart. He noted that the change in what type of spending was associated with recessions happened around the early 70&#8217;s. That time is when another major event happened. The rise in productivity disconnected from the rise in wages. That is, any rise in productivity did not produce a corresponding rise in wages as was the historical norm. My position is that this was the start of the &#8220;new&#8221; service economy of making money from money that went into full mode with Reagan. Ok, we went from government spending to private sector spending as the fuel for the economic engine which I agree with Mike is what is the real mechanisms that is behind the results Mike notes Tyler Cowen labeled The Great Stagnation. Mr. Cowen is correct, it&#8217;s a great stagnation, but stagnation has it&#8217;s cause. Regarding both Mike and Mr. Cowen, the shift from government spending to private sector spending being considered the fuel that resulted in stagnation is not the complete answer. The change in the means of spending coincides with the ideology change. We went all Milton and Rand ideologocially. However, the act of spending dollars and the means by which dollars are spent is not the fuel of the engine, it only referrers to the distribution of the fuel. Mike is taking about the distribution system and Mr. Cowen is talking about the results of using that system.</div>
<p>So, what is the real culprit? What is it about the fuel that made us get to where we are today? </p>
<p>We started starving the engine of fuel. And we did it by using a supposedly better fuel distribution system. Instead of moving the money into the engine via the broadest distribution system, we followed an idea that suggested a more focused distribution system would work. It has not worked. It has quite literally starved the engine of fuel. I noted <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/12/income-distribution-and-gdp-it-matters.html">this here</a>. <br />To quote that post using the time span of 1933 to 2005: </p>
<p>
<blockquote>For the first 43 years, GDP doubling was always ahead of the income. For the next 32 years, GDP growth was always behind the income which was do to the top 1%&#8217;s share. Their&#8217;s is the only income that increased faster than the economy. In chart form it looks like this:<br />First 43 years doubling: GDP 8.6 yrs, 99%&#8217;ers 10.75 yrs, 1%&#8217;ers 14.3 yrs.<br />Next 32 years doubling: GDP 10.6 yrs, 99%&#8217;ers 11 yrs, 1%&#8217;ers 8 yrs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first 43 years the share of income to the top 1% was declining to a low in 1976. After that in was increasing.</p>
<p>Ok, now to Mike&#8217;s chart. He stated: <br />
<blockquote>Basically, if you corner enough economists, you might get them to tell you recessions begin if there&#8217;s a big drop in private consumption, private investment, or gov&#8217;t spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading that statement while looking at his chart should be causing fire alarms and sirens to sound. This is because, if &#8220;private consumption&#8221; is an accepted cause of a recession, and the only time such appears to be associated is this current recession in 72 or so years of having recessions, then something has radically changed. If that chart showing that an accepted cause of recession only happened once in recent history, then honey, it&#8217;s the big one.</p>
<p>I think there is no way to deny it. Income inequality is the dinosaur in the room. It is the meteor that hit the earth. It is why all the past solutions theorized and used since the New Deal recovery are not working.   
<div>They can&#8217;t work because they do not address the predicted but never before (recent history) experienced.</div>
<p>So, look at my chart again. It&#8217;s borrowed money that keep the consumption going since 1996 (yeah the supposedly great Clinton year). You do know that the share of income rose faster to the top 1% during his 2 terms than during Reagan, Bush 1 and Bush 2? It was debt combined with &#8220;new products&#8221; designed to pretend people could pay the debt which kept it going. </p>
<p>In terms of numbers: $1,400,000,000,000. That&#8217;s 1.4 trillion dollars every year, year in and year out that the original system had moving through it that is now somewhere in the new system doing nothing as it relates to building a larger, stronger, healthier economic engine. You can&#8217;t cut taxes enough to make up for this. You can&#8217;t distribute enough money via QE to make up for this mostly because QE does not address this at all <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/monetary-policy-im-sorry-its-just-not.html">as noted.</a> <br />  <br />Still not convinced with my graph, Mike&#8217;s chart and the chart Ken referred too? Then try this on for size: <em><u>Recent Trends in Household Wealth in the United States: Rising Debt and the Middle-Class Squeeze—an Update to 2007, by Edward N. Wolff, Levy Economics Institute of Bard College</u></em> </p>
<p>March 2010 Page 20 to 22</p>
<blockquote><p>As noted above, the ratio of debt-to-net-worth of the middle three wealth quintiles rose from 37 percent in 1983 to 46 percent in 2001 and then jumped to 61 percent in 2007. Correspondingly, their debt-to-income rose from 67 percent in 1983 to 100 percent in 2001 and then zoomed up to 157 percent in 2007! This new debt took two major forms. First, because housing prices went up over these years, families were able to borrow against the now-enhanced value of their homes by refinancing their mortgages and by taking out home equity loans (lines of credit secured by their home)&#8230;Where did the borrowing go? Some have asserted that it went to invest in stocks. However, if this were the case, then stocks as a share of total assets would have increased over this period, which it did not (it fell from 13 to 7 percent between 2001 and 2007). Moreover, it did not go into other assets&#8230;The question remains whether the consumption financed by the new debt was simply normal consumption or was there a consumption binge (acceleration) during the 2000s emanating from the expanded debt? That is, did the enhanced debt simply sustain usual consumption or did it lead to an expansion of consumption?</p>
<p>The average expenditure of the median income class was virtually unchanged from 1989 to 2001 and also from 2001 to 2007. Thus, the CEX data, like the NIPA data, show no acceleration in consumer spending during the debt splurge of the 2000s. <strong>As a result, it can be concluded that the debt build-up of the 2000s went for normal consumption, not enhanced consumption.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Got that? Let&#8217;s summarize: The share of income to the 99% of people declined from 1976 onward. At the same time the means of making money changed from labor production to money manipulation (producer economy to finanicialized economy) adding to the reduction in share of income. We also changed the ideology to one from relying on the vast population (as represented by the individual and We the People) to relying on a small portion of the population to distribute what money was created. We did this for 33 years. By 1996, people were borrowing as a means to sustain their standard of living (not increase it). If the people are not spending to increase their standard of living, then is the economy really growing? By 2006 people were no longer able to make the payments and consumption was declining.  Then gas hit $4/gal and winter heating was looking like another $4000 to $6000 would be needed.</p>
<p>To date, nothing has been done to address this. Nothing at all. And, by &#8220;this&#8221; I mean, the income inequality that has resulted in an an economy where a very small group of people (top 1%) are taking money out of the system (that is money that would fuel the engine) faster than the engine can make it which results in an ever faster declining share to the rest of the people. Instead, we have refined new fuel and dumped it right into the top 1%&#8217;s hands and wonder why the engine is still sputtering? </p>
<p>One other issue I have with framing and the words used today: <em><u>Under water.</u></em> </p>
<p>People are not under water. They are not drowning in debt. On the contrary, people are dehydrating. They are starving for water. Do you know what the symptoms are of dehydration? You get thirsty and then urinate less to conserve water. (debt spending) Then you stop making tears and stop sweating. (can&#8217;t borrow) Eventually your muscles cramp, the heart palpitates and you get dizzy. (close to bankruptcy, voting against your interest) Let it go long enough and you get confused, weak and your coping mechanisms fail. (Tea Party, etc) In the end, your systems fail and you die. (recession)</p>
<p>People are dehydrating and Washington is doing nothing about it because they believe it is drowning.  They are throwing out life boats to people in a desert.  That is the chart Ken linked to.</p>

                                <p>Anyone who was in the MBS market and not working for a primary originator can tell you that the MBS securitization market ended around Halloween 2006.  (Those of us who were at places with origination go a few more months, but had no flow by February.)</p>
<p>Only economists were fooled by what I&#8217;ve been calling a <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/supply-side-factors-and-soft-patch.html">Xmas Miracle</a>, and even they (via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/06/our-lost-half-decade-and-its-not-over-yet.html">Mark Thoma</a>) are <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/06/08/were-halfway-to-a-lost-decade/">starting to wise up</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The blue line is the usual measure of GDP, which is obtained by adding up total spending. When you read the newspapers, this is the number they report. But the Fed’s Jeremy Nailewaik has convincingly shown that red line—which is the sum of all income—is the more reliable measure.  In theory the two lines should be identical—one person’s spending is another’s income—but in practice, the measurements differ. I’ve also plotted the peak, trough, and latest reading of each measure.<br />Focus on the red line, and you’ll see that the recession began in the final quarter of 2006, not the end of 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can sustain a bubble as long as more funds are coming into the system. Sell the 1BR on the West Side, reinvest the profits on the 2BR in Park Slope while that seller reinvests in 2,600 square feet in Summit or Hasting-on-Hudson who&#8230;</p>
<p>Until the incomes stop moving—transaction costs slow the margin, generally just after a few of the easier lenders demonstrate the flaws of their &#8220;business model&#8221; and the infrastructures have been built up at other firms based on those chimeric profits, when fixed costs and narrowing margins make better and better firms look worse and worse.</p>
<p>Economics has caught up with finance.  What will they think of next?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Reuters reports that <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/43290858">the mainstream Republican Party has decided to <s>jump the shark</s> admit it is insane</a>:<br />
<blockquote>David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush and a Republican advocate for raising the debt limit, said he holds regular question-and-answer sessions with Republican congressman over a beer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have yet to meet one Republican who actually says a failure to raise the debt limit scares them,&#8221; Frum said. &#8220;It is deeply, deeply troubling the number of Republicans I now talk to &#8211; and I include the mainstream &#8211; who think a technical default is manageable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many on Wall Street disagree.</p>
<p>They fear even the briefest default would cause a steep climb in interest rates worldwide and a tumbling U.S. dollar, which would tip a fragile economy back into recession and cause financial market upheaval on a scale not seen since the collapse of Lehman Bros.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let us be clear: a &#8220;technical default&#8221; is manageable. It is <em><strong>being managed right now</strong></em>. We&#8217;ve been in &#8220;technical default&#8221; since <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/04/will-the-us-really-default-in-may-if-the-debt-ceiling-isnt-raised/237719/">around May 15th</a>. Vendors are seeing payments delayed, contract signings are being put off, funding is being delayed. We can <a href="http://modeledbehavior.com/2011/02/04/failure-to-pay-us-soldiers-is-not-default/">not pay soldiers</a>, after all. They&#8217;re getting food and lodging in Afghanistan or Iraq or Libya anyway; they don&#8217;t need money.</p>
<p>Pat Toomey appears to believe that would be a good idea:<br />
<blockquote>Republican Senator Pat Toomey has even introduced legislation directing the U.S. Treasury to prioritize debt service over other payments if the debt limit is not raised. It has 22 Republican co-sponsors in the Senate and 98 in the House of Representatives, although no members of the Republican leadership have backed it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good thing Toomey thinks those <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/china-us-debt-ceiling-2011-6">ungrateful Chinese bondholders</a> are important. But who are they more important than?</p>
<p>Short answer: Republican voters.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Longer answer: Social Security recipients, who traditionally receive their checks and direct deposits on the 3rd of the month.</p>
<p>Which means the funding has to be available—to authorize scheduled ACH transfers, if nothing else—on the 2nd.</p>
<p>Which means— since for purposes of the &#8220;deficit,&#8221; Social Security is part of the &#8220;unified budget&#8221;—that Social Security&#8217;s EOD balance will decline on August 2nd, since there will be no coupon receipts or security redemptions that day.</p>
<p>In short, Toomey wants to pay bondholders and screw Social Security recipients. And he has at 110 Senators and Representatives who believe that is a good idea.</p>
<p>I want to see all 111 of them meet with all of their SocSec recipients on 3 August 2011 and tell them, &#8220;Well, we had to balance the suffering. And it was either you or the Chinese government. And they <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/06/httprobertreichorgpost6188608377.html">mean more to us than you do</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>UPDATE: Felix <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/06/08/will-geithner-prioritize-debt-repayment/">focuses on the same paragraph</a>, reaching half of the same conclusion. Take the next step, mate.</p>

<p>A recently released Medicare Trustees report detailing the insolvency of Medicare HI has been used by conservatives and supporting news media to call again for an overhaul or privatization of Medicare to save healthcare for those on Medicare. </p>

<p><i>&#8220;The gravest threat to Medicare is doing nothing. If we do nothing, not only will Medicare collapse but so will our fiscal house.”</i> Thursday, May 26, 2011; Senator Dan Coates Indiana</p>
<p>This is not the first time a politician, a think tank, or the news media has predicted the demise of Medicare due to exhausting its funds (Table 1). Both Medicare and Medicaid have also been identified numerous times as being the cause of rising healthcare cost resulting in calls for drastic over halls, privatization, state voucher programs, complete elimination, etc. In any case, 40 years later Medicare is still here and its funds will not be exhausted as claimed in the recent New York Times and Wall Street Journal articles. Instead, the program will not be able to meet its entire obligations for Medicare HI. <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2011/05/medicare-is-going-bankrupt-again.html">At the Chicago Tribune, Eric Zorn culls from the news media examples</a> of the sky falling in on Medicare:  <i>Medicare is Going Bankrupt Again</i>&#8221; May 5, 2011</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The Medicare hospital trust fund faces bankruptcy by 1976 and taxes must either be raised or benefits reduced the senate finance committee was told today</i>.” Chicago Tribune, July 2, 1969</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In the last few years, when it appeared that the Medicare trust fund would run out of money in 1987-89&#8230; But the need seemed less urgent after the Congressional Budget Office issued new estimates last September indicating that the Medicare trust fund would not go bankrupt until 1994.&#8221;</i> The New York Times; January 20, 1985</p>
<p><i>“The Medicare hospital insurance program faces bankruptcy by 1996, two years earlier than projected last year.”</i> The Washington Post; April 1, 1986</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Medicare trustees reported Wednesday that the program&#8217;s financial outlook is getting worse, touching off a new round of debate over the future of the federal health insurance system for the elderly and disabled. According to the trustees, who give the program a fiscal checkup every year, the fund that pays Medicare hospital bills dipped into the red last year and will go broke in early 2001. That&#8217;s a year earlier than they predicted in 1995.” </i>“DIRE FORECAST SPARKS NEW MEDICARE DEBATE TRUSTEES&#8217; REPORT USED AS FODDER FOR POLITICAL SALVOS BY BOTH SIDES,” The Chicago Tribune; June 6, 1996. </p>

<p>40+ years and the &#8220;EverReady&#8221; Medicare HI Bunny is still solvent as Eric Zorn shows in the chart above and details in his article. Much of today&#8217;s issues can be blamed on a smaller working Labor Force resulting in lower tax revenues.</p>
<p>The attack on Medicare with the threat of vouchers or overhaul has never had justification beyond &#8220;the sky is falling&#8221; proclamations. Furthermore such an overhaul would have no impact upon rising healthcare costs. Try (I did) finding out what certain services cost so you can control the cost of an outcome in a privatization scenario, when you are seriously ill, and the answers or non-answers from your doctor and the staff will only forestall your diagnosis/remedy. Similar to a 401K, the impact of proposed privatization and voucher plans shifts the burden of rising healthcare costs and risk to the healthcare recipient who will have far less of an impact on those rising costs as an individual and far less on a healthcare system encountered. The same as private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid reflects the rising cost of the healthcare industry intent on the selling of service, procedures, and product with Medicare being more efficient in controlling those costs in comparison. In the end; a few tweaks here and there as Coberly, Bruce, and others have suggested will provide a temporary fix to Medicare without impeding access to healthcare and not provide a solution to rising healthcare costs.</p>
