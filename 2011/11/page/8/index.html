                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The current consensus is that Berlusconi is toast, or, as Krugman would say, Crostini.</p>
<p>It is a bit risky to change horses in mid crisis and change Prime ministers in mid stream, but Berlusconi is a large part of the reason no one trusts Italy. Also everyone is totally sick of him especially his closest allies.</p>
<p>update update: The evidence that Berlusconi is falling is now somewhat stronger.  The opposition parties are now discussing who they might support as Prime minister of a government of national unity.  Basically the question is whether they will accept a member of Berlusconi&#8217;s inner circle so long as he is not Berlusconi or whether they demand Mario Monti.  They are suggesting that they will stand firm (yeah sure tell me about it).</p>
<p>La Repubblica is confusing me.  The headline and abstract guy suggests that UDC the wimply centrist ex Berlusconi allied party is ruling out a government lead by Berlusconi&#8217;s right hand man Gianni Letta &#8220;L&#8217;Udc (video) chiude a un incarico a Gianni Letta.&#8221; That is the UDS is rejects a nomination of Gianni Letta.  But the linked article says that the not quite so wimpy center-left main opposition party, the Democratic party PD, insists on someone untainted by Berlusconi (when asked, in effect, do you mean Monti, PD general secretary Bersani noted that the decision about who to ask to try to form a government is made by the President of the Republic, or in plain English yes.</p>
<p>OK now video.  The video does not make the advertized veto.  It is amusing as it shows the totally spineless center right long term Berlusconi ally P Casini advocating &#8220;revolution&#8221; but he in the video he doesn&#8217;t rule out a revolution lead by Berlusconi&#8217;s right hand man Letta.  Also the revolution is a revolution in the cause of austerity which is achieved by national unity and by ending intra-Italian conflict.  </p>
<p>Huh you ask ?  How can a revolution be an alternative to conflict ?  The fact is that this abuse of Italian is about average for around here.  A &#8220;revolution&#8221; is &#8220;a very big improvement,&#8221; not, you know, a revolution.  So Casini doesn&#8217;t even understand how absurd it is to talk about all parties united in the name of austerity as a revolution.  The video does show that Italy&#8217;s leading daily isn&#8217;t up to angrybearblog editorial standards, but it is funny*.  Imagine George Bush talking about the importance of knowledge and expertise.  </p>
<p>* Before anyone else mentions it, I admit that they do spell words correctly.  My spell checker keeps telling me that I am not typing correctly spelled Italian.  I can&#8217;t spell, but I usually find some way to get a computer to check my spellling (my computer isn&#8217;t working and I am embezzling the services of the computer which the Italian Public bought for Elisabetta&#8217;s research).</p>

                                <div><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson.html">This is a 16 minute</a> * lecture by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_G._Wilkinson">Richard Wilkinson</a>.  It is posted at TED.  I am posting it here, as I can not believe this information has not received more attention now that the US is awakening from the decades long delusion of prosperity which did not and as shown in the lecture could not lead to greater justice (which implies equality) via the model of economics we have been using. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The model known by many aliases (Chicago School, Friedman, etc) has resulted in the thought that people are drowning in debt and that we have privatized the profits but socialized the losses. These are inaccurate metaphors. They are the results of the language of the delusion we have been living for 3 decades and thus by definition can not capture the truth of our condition. As the science presented in the lecture shows, if our all encompassing concern should be equality, then people are not drowning, they are <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/monetary-policy-im-not-only-not-feeling.html">dehydrating</a>. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The dehydration is the results of privatizing security in life and socializing the risks in life. We are not “drowning” in risk or losses. We of the 99% are lacking in the substance that reduces risk. One can certainly drown from too much water, but the natural risk in life is not having too much water, it is having too little. Thus is the realization of the delusional statement “drowning in debt” and “socialized the losses”. </div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>The lack of reduction of life&#8217;s risks is the inequality, the social injustice&#8230;the diversion from the purpose expressed in the preamble to our Constitution. “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>The following <a href="http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/wilkinsoninequality.html">concluding statement</a> from a different lecture by Professor Wilkinson summarizes the TED lecture. As you watch the lecture keep in mind the 4 goals I highlighted of the preamble and consider that they were put into a document that created an government 223 years ago this year (based on ratification). I have a greater respect for the intellect and their insight into the human experience of those who wrote and ratified our Constitution. </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>“For thousands of years the best way of improving the quality of human life has been to raise material living standards. We are the first generation to have got to the end of that process. No longer does economic growth improve health, happiness, or wellbeing. If we are to improve the real quality of life further, we have to direct our attention to the social environment and the quality of social relations. But rather than continuing to tackle each problem separately, by spending more on medical care, more on police, social workers and drug rehabilitation units, we now know that it is possible to improve the psychosocial wellbeing and social functioning of whole societies. <strong>The quality of social relations is built on material foundations &#8211; on the scale of the material inequalities between us</strong>.” </p></blockquote>

                                <p>Italy is more fubar than you imagine possible even taking into account the fact that it is more fubar than you imagine possible.  That said, I insist the we are solvent (I am really really  and that Italian long term treasuries (BTPs) are a great buy right now.  </p>
<p>Please.  We need the money.  But I am not joking (OK I admit I am not buying BTPs either).</p>
<p>I really have to write about this, since it is the topic of the week and I actually live here.  So I will write a long long rambling post (with no useful links).</p>
<p>Update: check corrections at the end of the post.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The current critical situation</p>
<p>Since last summer, Italy has been in play &#8212; the price of BTPs fell sharply, that is, the interest rate spread between BTPs and Bunden (German bonds) shot up to  around 400 basis point 4%.  As a result, Italy enacted a harsh austerity plan with painful spending cuts.  The European Union fiscal nagging body (Ecofin) and, more importantly the European Central Bank (ECB) demanded more.  This lead to a series of rapidly proposed and revoked emergency plans.  The Berlusconi government has agreed on a further do something plan in which sales of public property (mostly land and real estate) play an important role (&#8220;First they sell the family silver&#8221; H. MacMillan)</p>
<p>The financial system has worked out not necessarily to Italy&#8217;s advantage &#8212; the latest BTP auction implies paying 6% interest on money raised and the Euro denominated BTP/bund spread is at a record high. The Italian Central Bank claims that Italy is solvent so long as it doesn&#8217;t have to pay more than 8%.  Investors are clearly not convinced.</p>
<p>Berlusconi&#8217;s wish was to temporarily pass this plan as an emergency decree &#8212; Presidential decrees temporarily have the force of law until they lapse or are converted into laws by Parliament.  His latest problem is that the President in question is President of the Republic Georgio Napolitano not President of the Cabinet Silvio Berlusconi, and Napolitano refused.  </p>
<p>The reason for this refusal was that the plan includes the immensely controversial proposal to make it easier for employers to fire employees (Italians employed by firms with more than 15 employees have about as much job security as US public sector employees).  This fits the &#8220;now more than ever&#8221; logic of conservatives proposing the same thing they always propose as a response to every crisis.  It is also what happens when you have an internal debate between advocates of austerity and stimulus, finally realize that they are opposites and look for a third way.</p>
<p>Anyway the plan is now a proposed amendment to the 2012 budget bill.  Berlusconi has declared the vote on the plan a vote of confidence. This limits debate and prevents obstruction and also means that he will no longer be Prime Minister of the majority of either house of Parliament votes no.</p>
<p>The Political Background</p>
<p>Berlusconi does not, at the moment, have a majority in the Camera dei Deputati (the lower house of Parliament).  Various allies have moved their party (or part of it) to opposition.  Various individual members of Parliament have switched parties.  Less than half of the deputies are now willing to say that they think that Berlusconi should be Prime minister.</p>
<p>This is partly the result of the financial crisis and the unpopularity of austerity, but it is mostly just the we&#8217;ve all had it up to hear with Berlusconi and are sick and tired of him (I have been sick and tired of him for 20 years).  He always used to be popular for some reason which I could never understand (especially because no one ever admitted voting for him). Now he is very unpopular with a favorable rating in the low thirties.  The only major politician with a lower rating is his one remaining important ally Umberto Bossi. Only 35% of adult Italians in a poll expressed support for any of the center-right parties which support Berlusconi.  In contrast 45% supported the center left coalition of parties and around 14% supported the coalition of center center parties which used to support Berlusconi but don&#8217;t anymore. Also the far left and far right has some support.  </p>
<p>It has been repeatedly demonstrated in court that Berlusconi has broken the law.  He has chosen not to contest these verdicts (note not accusations).  He hasn&#8217;t been condemned mostly because of the statue of limitations (which keeps running during trials and appeals in Italy) and partly because of special laws declaring his actions not to be crimes (that would be false accounting) or declaring that the Prime Minister can&#8217;t be prosecuted (he can again as those laws were declared unconstitutional as they clearly are).  Also sex scandals which are sordid and pathetic and not sexy at all.  Also a long record of horrible economic performance under Berlusconi (interrupted by a period of OK economic performance with rapid employment growth during 5 years when he was in opposition).  Also, come on it has long been obvious to everyone outside of Italy, and, in fact, everyone who doesn&#8217;t rely on Berlusconi controlled TV for their news.</p>
<p>So an amendment which must pass or else Italy might be treated as Greece is treated but at least Berlusconi will no longer be Prime Minister might be voted down.  The vote is scheduled for next week.  I&#8217;m pretty sure the opposition would be willing to vote yes on the condition that Berlusconi resign.  He won&#8217;t do this.</p>
<p>So what will happen ?  Don&#8217;t ask me.  It is more likely than not that the amendment will pass and Italy will muddle on.  The trade unions will not be pleased  (they will probably bring two or three million people to Rome to protest &#8212; a tiny change in the employment protection law was protested by the largest crowd in Roman history which is long).  This will not reassure investors.  Also parts of bills can be repealed by referenda and that part of this bill will be repealed.</p>
<p>If the amendment fails, well then maybe investors&#8217; reaction will send Italy to even the bank of Italy admits that things can&#8217;t go on this way levels and something will be done.  Also even if Berlusconi wins this one he is probably, in Paul Krugman&#8217;s words <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/mamma-mia/">&#8220;crostini.&#8221;<br /></a></p>
<p>If Berlusconi is removed what next ?  Parliament could decide for early elections.  This is a long process as the President of the Republic can only hold them after trying to find a new majority and failing.  Elections take a long time.  Many members of parliament will lose their jobs (which actually pay well by Italian standards).  They won&#8217;t like this.  So a more likely outcome would be some sort of government of national unity, probably with a Prime minister from the current cabinet.  This would reassure investors (surely most AngryBear readers know that when, at a joint press converence, Merkel and Sarkozy were asked if Berlusconi had reassured them, they looked at each other and laughed).</p>
<p>To me the natural candidate is the nerdy tightwad treasury minister Giulio Tremonti who has been fighting for austerity since forever.  He and Berlusconi are pretty much no longer on speaking terms (bit of a problem during a financial crisis).  The problem is that everyone hates Tremonti, so he isn&#8217;t mentioned as a possible national unity Prime Minister.</p>
<p>More likely would be one or another of the underling facilitators of Berlusconi.  Yech.  Some people dream that Mario Monti the right of center, highly respected former EU competition commissioner might be made Prime Minister.  The problem is that Berlusconi will absolutely oppose anyone but Berlusconi (he has never in his life voted confidence in anyone but himself).  He still has a whole lot of power.  So the government will be weak.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it would be good for my health to continue typing this post.</p>
<p>update: Two corrections:<br />First the current effort to raise money (mostly by selling publicly owned real estate) is an amendment to a &#8220;stability bill&#8221; not next year&#8217;s budget bill.  <br />Second, and more important, the proposed amendment doesn&#8217;t include the extremely unpopular provision making it easier to fire workers without proving just cause.  Basically, they tried to get the President to do this with an emergency decree, but didn&#8217;t dare ask members of parliament to vote for it.  The President was a communist so long as the Italian Communist Party lasted, the went with the more moderate part of the party.  OK so he was a notoriously boring stuffy conservative establishment communist, but still a communist.</p>

<p>the right&#8217;s smoke &#038; mirrors scams about corporate tax &#8220;reform&#8221;
<p>One could get a pretty gloomy picture of the state of Social Security, and the need to &#8220;reduce entitlements&#8221; while at the same time hearing about the (faked) urgency of cutting corporate taxes in order to give our US multinationals an edge in global competition, if you pay much attention to the GOP presidential candidates talk and listen to their echo chambers in the right-dominated GOP factions in the House and Senate and their marketers in the Koch etc. funded propaganda tanks like the misnamed &#8220;Americans for Prosperity&#8221; (should be &#8220;Americans for prosperity for the have-mores&#8221;). </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>These same right-wing politicians and funders were gung-ho for two budget-busting manuveurs under George W. Bush&#8211;outrageous tax cuts of primary benefit to the rich (such as the gradual reduction of the estate tax to its one-year repeal in 2010 and its rebirth in 2011 at an absurdly low rate with an equally absurdly high exemption amount) and outrageous spending for more and more militarization of the US society (wars of choice in Iraq and Afghanistan, where hundreds of thousands have died but little in the way of lasting peace has been gained, and a gigantic &#8220;homeland security&#8221; apparatus that has eroded the civil rights of US citizens, including allowing one to be targeted and assassinated on solely the say-so of the executive branch without any of the due process protections supposedly guaranteed by our pre-Bush constitution).  Cheney of course famously quipped that deficits don&#8217;t matter any more, when he was helping to push the $1.3 trillion 2001 tax cut that would give him and George W. huge tax cuts in the tens of thousands for 2001 alone.  Then there was the 2003 tax cuts aimed especially at relieving the have-mores of taxes on the money their money earned (cutting dividend rates on corporate stock to the same low rates as net capital gains) and the 2004 tax cuts aimed especially at giving multinational corporations the many tax breaks they&#8217;d been lobbying for avidly for the last two decades, along with a &#8220;repatriation holiday&#8221; that allowed the ones who&#8217;d worked most assiduously to avoid paying US taxes on their profits from intangible intellectual property rights to spend the money on outsize managerial compensation and shareholder stock buybacks while firing regular employees with very little or even no tax consequences.</p>
<p>Now, the right wants to repeat all of that.</p>
<p>Dave Camp, minion of multinational corporations, is crafting a give-it-all-away package of so-called corporate tax reform that may cut back on loopholes but in the process will lower rates and allow multinationals to offshore money-making enterprises, with the results that even fewer multinationals will actually pay any federal corporate income taxes. (The text of Camp&#8217;s release about his corporate tax &#8220;reform&#8221; proposal is appended at the end of this posting).  Camp calls for a 25% rate and a territorial tax system that would cut corporate tax revenues even further.  The Joint Tax Committee has noted that cutting all the loopholes in a base-broadening attempt would allow lowering the corporate tax rate only to 28%.  See <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20111102-714429.html">Wall Street Journal report on the JTC report</a>.</p>
<p> All of this is rationalized by the right as necessary to help US multinationals &#8220;compete&#8221; on the global stage. </p>
<p>You&#8217;d think that US corporations were slaving away under incredibly heavy US federal income tax burdens, but there&#8217;s no truth to that at all.  Most of the griping about the corporate tax talks solely about federal statutory rates and not about either the effective tax rates (what corporations actually pay) or about the lack of most of the other kinds of corporate taxes paid by corporations housed in other developed nations (much higher Value-Added Taxes and excise and transfer taxes). </p>
<p> In fact, most US multinational corporations are not heavily taxed at all, and most of the smaller US corporations zero out their profits with shareholder &#8220;salaries&#8221; (deductible) and other often easily manipulated expenses (personal expenses of &#8216;family farmers&#8217; whose homes and cars and everything else are &#8220;owned&#8221; by the family farm corporation, etc.).  Citizens for Tax Justice has for several years looked at publicly reporting US corporations&#8217; fiscal statements on taxes and profits to tell the real story about profitabilty and taxes.  It&#8217;s not the story the Chamber, the National Association of Manufacturers, or the anti-tax, anti-government funded groups or the Koch brothers want known.  But it&#8217;s the facts.  CTJ&#8217;s most recent study makes clear that US multinationals have no trouble competing due to taxes.  See the report: <a href="http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2011/11/corporate_taxpayers_corporate_tax_dodgers_2008-2010.php">Corporate Taxpayers and Corporate Tax Dodgers, 2008-2010</a>. </p>
<p>As Andrew Leonard reports today, the study shows that 37 of the country&#8217;s largest corporations paid zero taxes in 2010.</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2010, Verizon reported an annual profit of nearly $12 billion. The statutory federal corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, so theoretically, Verizon should have owed the IRS around $4.2 billlion. Instead, according to figures compiled by the Center for Tax Justice, the company actually boasted a <em>negative tax liability</em> of $703 million. Verizon ended up making even more money <em>after</em> it calculated its taxes.</p>
<p>Verizon is hardly alone, and isn’t even close to being the worst offender. Perhaps most famously, General Electric raked in $10.5 billion in profit in 2010, yet ended up reporting $4.7 <em>billion</em> worth of negative taxes. The worst offender in 2010, as measured by its overall negative tax rate, was Pepco, the electricity utility that serves Washington, D.C. Pepco reported profits of $882 million in 2010, and negative taxes of $508 million — a negative tax rate of 57.6 percent.</p>

<p>Andrew Leonard, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/11/03/the_great_corporate_tax_scam/?source=newsletter">America&#8217;s Corporate Tax Obscenity</a>, Salon (Nov. 3, 2011).  Four industries&#8211;finance, utilities, oil/gas/natural resources and IT&#8211; reap huge windfalls from the current corporate tax code.  Those windfalls that aren&#8217;t likely to be eliminated in any &#8220;reform&#8221; that passes the right-wing Congress&#8211;just look at the current lobbying for maintaining the &#8220;active financing&#8221; exception for banks&#8217; passive income, an exception that allows banks to defer taxation on their passive earnings, unlike most other industries. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way that a territorial tax system (that allows US corporations to continue moving active businesses offshore tax free and moving patents and other rights off shore to ensure that the income from the rights aren&#8217;t taxed in the US) combined with incredibly low rates will raise an appropriate amount of income from corporations.  It is a giveaway to the corporations that think they have now bought Congress. At the same time, as the CTJ report authors note, most of these reform schemes actually will allow corporations to move even more jobs and businesses offshore.  If we really wanted to enact good corporate tax reform, we&#8217;d remove the loopholes favoring big industries like Big Oil, get rid of the accelerated depreciation allowances that let companies expense long-term investments, require an &#8220;exit tax&#8221; of ordinary income on all appreciated assets and untaxed earnings whenever a corporation restructures itself into a foreign company or moves its active business assets abroad, and otherwise tighten up the corporate tax rules to ensure that corporations pay a fair share in taxes.</p>
<p> It is up to the people to show that they haven&#8217;t loss the power to take control in our democracy, but given the lack of understanding of tax and fiscal issues in this country, and the deep pockets of corporations to fund the Chamber and other group&#8217;s misleading information and distortion of facts on these issues, it is questionable whether US democracy can save itself.</p>
<p>Appendix:  Camp release about proposal for corporate tax &#8220;reform&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-MI) unveiled an international tax reform discussion draft as part of the Committee&#8217;s broader effort on comprehensive tax reform that would lower top tax rates for both individuals and employers to 25 percent. In addition to rate cuts, the plan would transition the United States from a worldwide system of taxation to a territorial system &#8211; a move virtually every one of America&#8217;s global competitors has already made.</p>
<p>Camp unveiled the draft legislative language with a specific request &#8211; that employers, academics, practitioners and workers provide comment and add their voices to the legislative process.</p>
<p>Commenting on the release of the proposal as a part of his overall approach to comprehensive tax reform, Camp stated, &#8220;Instead of having laws on the books that encourage hiring U.S. workers, our outdated international tax system encourages employers to keep profits and jobs outside of America. If we are serious about creating a climate for job creation, now is the time to adopt tax policies that empower American companies to become more competitive and make the United States a more attractive place to invest and create the jobs this country needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ways and Means discussion draft would:</p>
<p>&#8211; Reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 percent &#8211; bringing it in line with the average of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Committee continues to examine base broadening measures that will replace the revenue foregone by reducing the corporate tax rate, so these measures are reserved in the discussion draft for future release.</p>
<p>&#8211; Shift from a worldwide system of taxation to a territorial-based system. The new plan:</p>
<p>* Exempts 95 percent of overseas earnings from U.S. taxation when profits are brought back to the United States from a foreign subsidiary.</p>
<p>* Includes anti-abuse rules to ensure companies do not avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes.</p>
<p>* Frees up existing overseas earnings to be reinvested in America after they are taxed at a low rate in line with current repatriation proposals.</p>
<p>* Makes American companies more competitive on the global stage with little or no impact on the federal deficit.</p>
<p>In advocating the need for international tax reform, Camp cited several reasons why current U.S. tax policies are putting American employers and workers at a competitive disadvantage:</p>
<p>&#8211; America will soon have the highest corporate tax rates in the industrialized world: Only Japan has a higher corporate tax rate than America, which has a combined federal-state rate of 39.2 percent &#8211; and Japan has already indicated its intent to lower its rate.</p>
<p>&#8211; Our &#8220;worldwide&#8221; system of taxation is a remnant from the Cold War: While it has been 25 years since Congress reformed the tax code, it has been almost 50 years since it undertook a bottom-up review of our international tax laws. In other words, our international tax rules were written when the United States accounted for 50 percent of the global economy and had no serious competition from others.</p>
<p>&#8211; American employers face double taxation compared to their foreign competitors: As a result of our &#8220;worldwide&#8221; system of taxation, when U.S.-based companies try to bring profits back home, they must pay U.S. taxes on top of the tax they already pay in the foreign market U.S. tax laws encourage investing in a foreign country instead of bringing profits back home: Because U.S.-based employers face additional taxes if they bring their overseas earnings back to invest in the United States, it is cheaper for these companies to reinvest profits overseas instead of creating jobs here.</p>
<p>&#8211; America is losing ground: In 1960, U.S.-headquartered companies comprised 17 of the world&#8217;s largest 20 companies &#8211; that&#8217;s 85 percent. By 2010, just six &#8211; or a mere 30 percent &#8211; U.S.-headquartered companies ranked among the top 20.</p>
<p>&#8211; Our foreign competitors are actively reforming their tax laws: Other countries are actively reforming their international tax codes &#8211; giving employers lower rates and moving towards a territorial tax system. Countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany, have recently lowered their tax rates to spur job creation and economic growth. Yet, America is sitting on the sidelines doing nothing. The United States cannot sit back and watch jobs go overseas because the tax code provides such perverse incentives.</p>

                                <p>The employment report showed little evidence that the trends of the past year have changed.<br />Over the past three months private payroll employment grew some 72,000, 191,000 and 104,000<br />while government employment fell 132,000, 33,000 and 24,000.<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rJ_sutjCrj4/TrPm11XW4cI/AAAAAAAAB1M/7yqjYIv-Pjg/s1600/Clipboard01%2Bprivate%2Bpayroll.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rJ_sutjCrj4/TrPm11XW4cI/AAAAAAAAB1M/7yqjYIv-Pjg/s320/Clipboard01%2Bprivate%2Bpayroll.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3OifFJw8nN0/TrPkzkTeVKI/AAAAAAAAB0o/nTsgiSj10Zo/s1600/Clipboard01%2BPAY%2BCYCLES.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3OifFJw8nN0/TrPkzkTeVKI/AAAAAAAAB0o/nTsgiSj10Zo/s320/Clipboard01%2BPAY%2BCYCLES.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a> <a name="more"></a><br />The one encouraging signs was the third strong month of employment growth reported in the household survey.  Over the last three month it has shown gains of 331,000, 398,000 and 277,000.<br />After slowing earlier this year the growth of employment reported by the household survey is<br />reaccelerating. Because the household survey often leads the payroll survey this is a significant trend change to watch.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Frz3HTCRLNE/TrPnKszqtBI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/yDeM_dq5dNw/s1600/Clipboard01%2Bemp%2Bgrowth.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Frz3HTCRLNE/TrPnKszqtBI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/yDeM_dq5dNw/s320/Clipboard01%2Bemp%2Bgrowth.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>The average weekly hours was unchanged at 33.4 so the index of aggregrate hours worked only increased 0.1% as compared to a 0.5% gain last month and a -0.2% drop in the previous month.<br />But overall the trend of modest gains in hours worked has not changed.</p>

It looks like the slowdown is accelerating, not reversing.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tvddwdtEWcA/TrPk95T-oBI/AAAAAAAAB00/EF_euRvlETQ/s1600/Clipboard01%2BXAHE.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tvddwdtEWcA/TrPk95T-oBI/AAAAAAAAB00/EF_euRvlETQ/s320/Clipboard01%2BXAHE.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>With the small change in the workweek the slowing of average hourly earnings means that average weekly earnings growth is also slowing.  While the European situation earns the headlines and the market is reacting strongly to those headlines it still looks to me like the major risk to the economy and the markets is weak income growth.  The third quarter improvement in consumer spending and the economy stemmed from consumers drawing down savings and taking on debt as the savings rate fell significantly.<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i6MVH80WImg/TrPlLJaT6EI/AAAAAAAAB1A/ez9yufNThrM/s1600/Clipboard01%2Bweek%2Bwage.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i6MVH80WImg/TrPlLJaT6EI/AAAAAAAAB1A/ez9yufNThrM/s320/Clipboard01%2Bweek%2Bwage.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>

<p>Worries About Italy: Growth and Politics<  
</p>
<p>Current bond market pricing implies a 6.17% yield on a 10-yr Italian government bond, or 430 basis points (%/100) over a like German government bond. I’d call this distressed levels for Italian debt, especially for an economy that is very likely contracting as we speak. Today <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/11/links-for-2011-11-03.html">Mark Thoma </a>points us to Kash Mansori’s article on “Italy’s future”. In the article, <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/italys-future.html">Kash points out that </a>the [market] “<em><strong>is worried </strong>about Italian debt dynamics <strong>simply and purely because of skyrocketing interest rate </strong>expenses that the Italian government is now facing thanks to the eurozone debt crisis.</em>”</p>
<p>I disagree and comment that his argument is circular in nature. See, the market is pricing in Italian solvency risk by way of a rising risk premium, which then portends more solvency risk as borrowing costs rise. But the market is not pricing in solvency risk <em>because of the risk premium, </em>rather the risk premium is rising due to (1) terrible growth dynamics in Italy, and (2) heightened political risk in Italy.</p>

<p>The PMI’s illustrate the likely recession in Italy – <a href="http://www.roubini.com/analysis/165315.php">Roubini Global Economics</a> is pointing to negative growth starting in Q3 2011. Those countries that issue debt in a foreign currency (since Italy does not <em>own</em> the euro rather it <em>uses </em>the euro) are subject to market constraints. And with negative growth comes higher government deficits; but the market is not satisfied with the high Italian public debt levels.  Therefore, bond investors push for ‘fiscal discipline’ via a rising risk premium.</p>
<p>Another driver of the increasing Italian risk premium is political risk. You can see this in the spread between Italian 10yr bond yields and the Spanish 10yr bond yields, which has collapsed since the summer and is now trading at -70 bps. That means the Spanish sovereign is borrowing at a 10yr yield that is 70 bps cheap to Italy, where it used to pay a premium. Something idiosyncratic is going on with Italy.</p>

<p>The beginning of July corresponds with the outset of a<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18867308"> political rift </a>that brought the credibility of Berlusconi, as it pertains to Tremonti’s deficit targets, into question. Berlusconi now has only a slim majority in the Parliament, so passing future legislation tied to fiscal austerity is fraught with risk. Despite the fact that Italy is forecast to run a 2011 primary surplus (just <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2011/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2009&#038;ey=2016&#038;scsm=1&#038;ssd=1&#038;sort=country&#038;ds=.&#038;br=1&#038;c=156%2C158%2C132%2C112%2C134%2C111%2C136&#038;s=GGXONLB_NGDP&#038;grp=0&#038;a=&#038;pr1.x=66&#038;pr1.y=11">one of two just G7 economies</a>), the recessionary outlook requires added fiscal discipline and reform. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-03/berlusconi-arrives-at-g-20-empty-handed-after-vowing-revamp.html">To date, we’ve seen </a>no such legislation, just promises on the reform front. Implementation risk is high in Italy, thus the risk premium rises.</p>
<p>So interest rates are rising as a consequence of the deteriorating economic fundamentals and questionable politics; that’s what the market is <em>worried about</em>. I do agree with Kash, though, that austerity is not the answer. But that’s how the Germans are rolling. This idea of fiscal austerity and gaining competitiveness is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_Plus_Pact">new mantra for Europe </a>&#8211; a mantra that will probably make or break the EA. I refer you to an<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3ba2f7c4-ee76-11e0-a2ed-00144feab49a.html&#038;sa=U&#038;ei=DdOyTojZGOjj0QHX17i7BA&#038;ved=0CBsQFjAA&#038;usg=AFQjCNELDitVAfJX2cdfse6dHErkJ2sV6w">excellent article by Martin Wolf </a>that lays out the Euro area adjustment challenges clearly and succinctly.</p>

<p>The Kimel Curve and the Kitchen Sink, Part 2:  The Reagan Era to the Present</p>
<p>I often post about the relationship between the top marginal tax rate and economic growth, which I&#8217;ve noted can be described this way:</p>
<p>% change in real GDP from t to t+1 =
<div> a + b*Top Marginal Tax Rate at time t<br />                                      + c* Top Marginal Tax Rate squared at time t</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ve modestly described that relationship as the &#8220;Kimel curve.&#8221;)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done this many times, and have added all sorts of things to the curve, but in every case, the results are more or less the same:  the top marginal tax rate that maximizes growth is somewhere in the neighborhood of about 64%, give or take about 5%.</p>
<p>Its usually my practice to use all data available when I&#8217;m estimating that relationship.  That means going back to 1929, the first year for which the BEA keeps data on real GDP.  In part that&#8217;s because I get accused of cherrypicking if I don&#8217;t use all the data available.  But lately I&#8217;ve started getting accused of somehow trying to bias results by using all the data available.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m going to run a version of the model similar to the one I ran <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/by-mike-kimel-ive-been-writing-about.html">last week</a>, but I&#8217;m going to start with data from 1981, which is when Reaganomics set in.</p>
<p>(More after the jump!)<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The specific model I&#8217;m going to estimate is this</p>
<p>% change in real GDP from t to t+1 =</p></div>
<div> a + b*Top Marginal Tax Rate at time t<br />+ c* Top Marginal Tax Rate squared at time t<br />                                     + d* % of pop 35 &#8211; 44 at time t<br />                                     + e* % of pop 45 &#8211; 54 at time t<br />                                     + f* President is a Republican (Y/N) at time t</p>
<p>Here are the results:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C_UynkVQ-sw/TrNIxh1uXUI/AAAAAAAAAvk/nlwDRQMx0h8/s1600/kitchen%2Bsink.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C_UynkVQ-sw/TrNIxh1uXUI/AAAAAAAAAvk/nlwDRQMx0h8/s320/kitchen%2Bsink.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>A few things to note:  the percentage of the population 35 to 44 is not significant, though it was significant when data going back to 1929 was used.  Conversely, the percentage of the population 45 to 54 was not significant with data going back to 1929, but is significant here.  What that tells me is that for much of the period from 1929 to the present, the percentage of the population 35 to 44 was one of the more important demographics for driving growth.  However, more recently, the population 45 to 54 has become more important reflecting the reduced importance of manual labor.</p>
<p>The Republican dummy wasn&#8217;t significant when using data going back to 1929&#8230; and it isn&#8217;t significant in the more recent period either.</p>
<p>But what really matters, in my opinion at least, is this:  the coefficients on the top marginal tax rate and the top marginal tax rate squared are both significant.  The former is positive and the latter is negative.  That means the Kimel curve applies to the period since 1981 to the present as well.</p>
<p>The growth maximizing tax rate obtained when using data for the period from 1981 on is 44%, about 20 percentage points below the top marginal rate obtained when using data going back to 1929.  So, why the difference?  I don&#8217;t know, but I have some ideas:</p>
<p>1.  The period from 1981 on includes one observation where the tax rate was above 50% (i.e., 1981, when the economy was in a recession), several at 50%, and the rest below.  The model simply hasn&#8217;t &#8220;observed&#8221; higher tax rates and the growth rates associated with those higher tax rates.</p>
<p>2.  Prior to Reagan, the public was more accepting of the idea that tax rates should be higher.  Reagan changed the zeitgeist.  The government became the problem, not the solution, and taxes, well taxes came to be viewed as theft.</p>
<p>My guess is that its a combination of both factors.  But even if you lean primarily toward the second reason, and assume the optimal tax rate has shifted down over time&#8230; its still well above where tax rates are now.</p>
<p>In fact, tax rates have been below 40% since 1987.  The annualized growth rate in real GDP during the 23 years from 1987 to 2010 was 2.6%.  The last time real GDP grew that slowly during a 23 year period was&#8230;  well, who knows &#8211; it never happened before then in the time since the BEA has been keeping data.  If you decide to, well, cherry pick and leave out the Great Recession&#8230;  the annualized growth rates in real GDP from 1987 to 2007 was a hair over 3% a year.  Previous to that, the last time annualized growth rates were that low for the same number of years occurred at the end of World War 2.  Put another way&#8230;  the period from 1987 on may have been a success in terms of keeping tax rates low, but it has been a failure in terms of economic growth, as the only time the economy has done worse was when it switched out of a command economy and went immediately into a recession.  (I can&#8217;t help but notice that the only time when the economy did worse happened to come during what David R. Henderson refers to as the <a href="http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/publication/U.S.%20Postwar%20Miracle.Henderson.11.4.10.pdf">Post War Economic Miracle</a>.)  Better policy would get us faster economic growth and that would be good for everyone, even those paying the highest marginal rates.</p>
<p>Housekeeping&#8230;  GDP data came from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">BEA</a> and tax rates came from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a>.</p>
<p>A few other comments&#8230;  the correlation between residuals at time t and time t+1 in the model estimated is about 16.5%.  One could do other checks, but it seems very, very unlikely that autocorrelation is a problem here.  Of course, we&#8217;re also missing some important variables&#8230; the fit could be a lot higher.   I&#8217;ll start incorporating some of the suggestions I received from readers after the last post.</p>
