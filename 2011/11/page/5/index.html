<p>GOP two-step approach problematic
<p>Discussion continued apace yesterday about the &#8220;supercommittee&#8221; and the idea of agreeing to agree someday on some revenue increases while going ahead with cuts.</p>
<p>This approach is a terrible one since it gives the obstructionist GOP members just another setting in which to refuse to go ahead with tax increases and to &#8220;negotiate&#8221; yet again over just what counts as a revenue increase.  Like the gimmicks that became so overused in the 2001, 2003, 2004 Bush tax bills, this &#8220;deal&#8221; is just another gimmick for the radical right to get its way&#8211;cuts to Social Security and Medicare, cuts to all programs intended to help the vulnerable, no cuts to military programs, and no tax increases&#8211;especially not for the rich.</p>
<p>Republicans on the right are already arguing for applying &#8220;dynamic analysis&#8221; which tends, in their versions, to be rosy scenarios of increased growth due to tax cuts:  <a name="more"></a> this is a cop-out way to claim revenue increases that won&#8217;t materialize while making actual cuts to much needed social programs.  They are also arguing for dramatic changes in the way the earned benefits programs work&#8211;such as means-testing for recipients&#8211;as first steps in working towards outright elimination of those programs.  You get comments like those of Jim Jordan (Republican of Ohio) who wrote in an op-ed in USA Today that taxes &#8220;should not punish success to satisfy some false definition of balance.&#8221;  See Rubin,  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-14/debt-accord-may-be-two-step-process-hensarling-says.html">Debt Accord May be Two-Step Process, Hensarling Says</a>, Bloomberg (Nov. 14, 2011).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jim Jordan (Republican of Ohio) said in a USA Today piece that taxes should not be raised because they &#8220;should not punish success to satisfy some false definition of balance.&#8221;  Id. </p>
<p>This is a wrongheaded view of taxes.  The radical right uses language about taxes &#8220;punishing success&#8221; because they see defending the rich from  taxation as their mission.  The rich are defined as &#8220;successful&#8221;&#8211;even if the wealth is merely built on top of inherited wealth and position, and even if the rich did nothing at all to earn the wealth.  Taxes do not punish success.  Taxes are the way that we cooperate together to fund important government programs that serve all of us.  Even when they act as transfer programs that transfer resources to the poor and elderly, they are serving all of us by making our society work better. </p>

<p>Scott Sumner Digs Deeper</p>
<p>Scott Sumner <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=11887">criticizes</a> my most recent post in which I indicate that Keynesian theory explains growth rates during the New Deal era better than theories proposed by monetarists.</p>
<p>He starts by criticizing this, which I wrote in my <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/11/sumner-skidelsky-keynes-and-liquidity.html">earlier post</a>.<br />
<blockquote>Aggregate demand was very slack when FDR took office.</p>
<p>FDR showed up in Washington with a plan to start spending a lot of money and thus boost aggregate demand.</p>
<p>The immediate effect was to convince factories they&#8217;d be running down their inventories. That boosted producer prices. It had a much smaller effect on consumer prices because everyone knew the gubmint was going to buy a heck of a lot more producer goods than consumer goods. (The government did buy some consumer goods for the various programs, plus there was a spillover effect, but as the graph clearly shows, the action was on the producer side.) </p>
<p>After a bit of time, the public realized FDR wasn&#8217;t planning just a one-off, but rather a sustained program of purchases of industrial items. That led them to start using some of their idle capacity, which meant not just selling the fixed amount that was in inventory. The rate of price increases thus dropped. </p>
<p>GDP increased the fastest rate in the United States peacetime history since data has been kept. There was a big hiccup, of course, in 1937 when the government cut back on spending for a while. </p></blockquote>
<p>Sumner&#8217;s most important point:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prices didn’t start rising when FDR came to Washington with spending plans; they started rising when he began depreciating the dollar.  Furthermore, the weekly rise in the WPI index was highly correlated with weekly increases in the dollar price of gold (i.e. currency depreciation.)  And those changes (in gold prices) were caused by explicit statements and actions by FDR.  Not by fiscal stimulus, which would be expected to appreciate the dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK.  Using the cool graphical tool from FRED, the Federal Reserve Economic Database, I generated this graph of the series that from what I can tell seems to be Sumner&#8217;s favorite price index when discussing the period:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1Cqq3EfPBmM/TsJlNCRi01I/AAAAAAAAAwE/HcK96jO1Ieg/s1600/Sumner_digs_deeper.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1Cqq3EfPBmM/TsJlNCRi01I/AAAAAAAAAwE/HcK96jO1Ieg/s320/Sumner_digs_deeper.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Now, take a gander at the graph.  And bear in mind, FDR was inaugurated in March 1933.  But everyone knew what he was going to do, spending-wise, once he showed up.  You can see the decline in prices halt and start reversing even before he took office.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&#8217;m not sure what Sumner means when he refers to the period when he says FDR &#8220;began depreciating the dollar.&#8221;  There was a gold standard in place going back a long time.  That means the value of the dollar was its price in gold.  The price of gold was $20.67 an ounce for decades before FDR took office.  It was $20.67 an ounce until the Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934, when the price of gold was changed to $35 an ounce.  (To be precise, the government devalued the dollar on January 31, the day after the Act passed.)  </p>
<p>The peak in the curve came in February 1934, days or at most weeks (the index isn&#8217;t that precise) after the Gold Reserve Act.  Put another way&#8230;  price inflation using Sumner&#8217;s measure peaked when the currency was devalued.  That is precisely 100% the opposite of what Sumner wrote.  </p>
<p>But there are some extenuating circumstances for Sumner.   </p>
<p>(The next paragraph summarizes <a href="http://www.moneychanges.org/2011/04/jesse-jones-gives-inside-story-on-fdr-gold-and-great-depression/">this story</a>, from the memoirs of Jesse Jones.)  </p>
<p>It seems that on October 22, 1933, Jones, the head of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and Henry Morgenthau, then Farm Credit Administrator but soon to be Treasury Secretary, were told by FDR to come by on October 23 to devaluing the dollar by changing its relationship with gold.  The three men &#8211; FDR, Morgenthau, and Jones, then went about raising the price of gold by fiat between then and January 31, 1934, when prices came to rest at $35 an ounce, a price where they stayed through 1971.</p>
<p>I assume that&#8217;s what Sumner is talking about.  So let me modify Figure 1 to only show the period from January to October 1933.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KYBtQL7TEUw/TsJlNRh3FoI/AAAAAAAAAwQ/NL9WCbZLdjE/s1600/Sumner_digs_deeper2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KYBtQL7TEUw/TsJlNRh3FoI/AAAAAAAAAwQ/NL9WCbZLdjE/s320/Sumner_digs_deeper2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>Now, recall, Sumner&#8217;s evidence that the Keynesian view is wrong and the monetary view is right is:  &#8220;Prices didn’t start rising when FDR came to Washington with spending plans; they started rising when he began depreciating the dollar.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet&#8230;  the graph shows very clearly that prices started to rise when FDR came to Washington with spending plans, not at the end of October when he began depreciating the dollar.  As is very evident from the graph, by that time prices had already been increasing for quite a while.  Wholesale prices, by October 1, were up 17% from the beginning of the year.  If you started in October of 1933, it wasn&#8217;t until December of 1936 before prices increased another 17%.  </p>
<p>The point is, Sumner is wrong.  He is very wrong about when prices started to rise.  He is also very wrong about why prices started to rise.  And since &#8220;when&#8221; and &#8220;why&#8221; are assumptions in his model, his model is very wrong.  </p>
<p>Now, for completeness I&#8217;m going to tackle the other thing Sumner mentioned in his post.  Sumner&#8217;s critique of me includes this:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are all sorts of the problems with the argument that the inflation of 1933-34 was caused by expectations of fiscal stimulus.  First of all, it’s completely at variance with Keynesian theory, which Kimel seems to be trying to defend.  Keynesian theory says demand stimulus doesn’t raise prices when there is “slack,” and there has never been more slack in all of American history than in 1933.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem for Sumner is that Keynesian theory is merely an extension of good old fashioned Adam Smith.  Prices depend on supply and demand.  You can have a good or service go up in price locally even as it goes down everywhere else.  </p>
<p>As I noted in my earlier post, and he quoted:  </p>
<blockquote><p>The immediate effect was to convince factories they&#8217;d be running down their inventories&#8230; After a bit of time, the public realized FDR wasn&#8217;t planning just a one-off, but rather a sustained program of purchases of industrial items. That led them to start using some of their idle capacity, which meant not just selling the fixed amount that was in inventory. The rate of price increases thus dropped.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which of course, is very consistent with the timing of events.  </p>
<p>None of this is to pick on Sumner.  There&#8217;s a whole cottage industry dedicated to advancing a story that government spending cannot have a positive effect on the economy during recessions or depressions.  The problem for those trying to advance that story is that government spending does seem to correlate with positive effects during those periods.  So alternate theories are proposed, and have been proposed for decades.  And those theories often make a lot of sense&#8230; until you take a close look at the data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/supreme_court/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Supreme Court</a> on Monday agreed to hear a challenge to the 2010 <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/health_care_reform/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">health care overhaul</a> law, President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. The development set the stage for oral arguments by March and a decision in late June, in the midst of the 2012 presidential campaign…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/11/13/us/politics/challenges-to-the-health-law.html">Appeals from three courts had been vying for the justices’ attention</a>, presenting an array of issues beyond the central one of whether Congress has the constitutional power to require people to purchase health insurance or face a penalty through the so-called individual mandate. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court agreed to hear appeals from just one decision, from the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, <a name="more"></a>  the only one so far striking down the mandate. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/13/us/13health.html">The decision</a>, from a divided three-judge panel, said the mandate overstepped Congressional authority and could not be justified by the constitutional power “to regulate commerce” or “to lay and collect taxes.” </p>
<p>The appeals court went no further, though, severing the mandate from the rest of the law. </p>
<p>On Monday, the justices agreed to decide not only whether the mandate is constitutional but also whether, if it is not, how much of the balance of the law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, must fall along with it. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>On Monday, the justices agreed to consider that question. The justices also said they would consider an intriguing threshold issue.</p>
<p>In September, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/health/policy/09virginia.html">ruled that it was premature to decide the case</a> in light of the Anti-Injunction Act, a federal law that bars suits “for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.” The Supreme Court had interpreted the term “tax” very broadly for purposes of the law. </p>
<p>If the Fourth Circuit ruling is correct, individuals may not challenge the individual mandate until the first penalty is due in April 2015. On Tuesday, a dissenting judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/health/policy/appeals-court-upholds-health-care-law.html">also endorsed that position</a>. </p>

<p>So the Democrats and Republicans on the so-called &#8220;Super-Committee&#8221; that is supposed to find $1.2 trillion in budget reductions/increased revenues within a week now thinks it has a solution&#8211;let the regular tax committees (Finance and Ways &#038; Means) come up with the tax revenues, while the Super-Committee will go on and specify the spending cuts.  See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/us/politics/panel-seeks-way-to-reach-a-deal-on-tax-increase.html">Deficit Panel Seeks to Defer Details on Raising Taxes</a>, New York Times (Nov. 14, 2011).</p>
<p>The proposal doesn&#8217;t sound like anything that the Dems on the panel should accept.  For a piddling reduction in some of the deductions available to the most affluent individuals, the GOP is willing to lower the rate on those individuals to 28%!  Just more enriching the rich.  The Dems shouldn&#8217;t agree to that.  Especially since Grover Norquist thinks that any such agreement would be undone immediately, while any stupid agreement the Dems make to &#8220;reforming&#8221; (i.e., cutting benefits from) the earned benefits programs will be allowed to take place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grover G. Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, whose antitax pledge has been signed by most Republicans in Congress, said in an interview, “I am not losing any sleep” over the Republicans’ latest proposal. Mr. Norquist said he was confident that, “at the end of the day, the Republican House will not pass a tax increase.”</p>
<p>“As a face-saving measure,” Mr. Norquist said, the deficit reduction panel “could give lots of instructions to the tax-writing committees.” In complying with those instructions, he said, the House and the Senate could pass very different bills.  Id.</p>

<p>It is hard to see why any cuts to the earned benefits programs should be made. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are more important now than ever because of the weak economy.  We are a rich country and we can afford these programs.Tax 100% of compensation for Social Security.   And treat all profits interests as compensation income when allocations are received, so that partnerships treat persons as partners only when they have a capital investment in the partnership business.</p>
<p>Let the military be cut at least $750 billion.  And raise the rest through taxes&#8211;especially through a progressive estate tax and through eliminating the character preference for capital gains income. </p>
<p>This country is tired of being held hostage by far-right radicals  who don&#8217;t understand that the government acts for the people and who don&#8217;t give a damn for anybody that isn&#8217;t in the top 20% of the income and wealth distribution.  We are tired of the radical right&#8217;s anarchistic actions to prevent the government from borrowing money to carry out important programs.  We are tired of the radical right&#8217;s stupidity about the economy and its reliance on ideological beliefs in &#8220;trickle down&#8221; programs to justify tax cuts no matter what situation the country is in.  We are tired of the radical right&#8217;s refusal to acknowledge the facts about the failures of the four-decade experiment with reaganomics, during which time the large multinational corporations have been allowed to function like quasi-sovereigns.  We are tired of seeing tax policies that support consolidation of corporate empires and movement of business overseas, while Americans lose jobs and watch their wages decline.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Contentv2.pdf">From the report</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Procurement funding grew from $62.6B in FY01 to as much as $135.8B throughout the decade.3 In constant dollars, base procurement funding in FY10 increased by 41 percent from FY01.4 Increases also were augmented by the use of supplemental war funding. In FY02, only $1.4B was appropriated for procurement in supplemental war funding. That increased every year until $65.9B was appropriated in FY08. FY08 ended up as the high water mark, but the following three years have all seen procurement funding of about $30B included in war funding.5 In all, $232.8B or 22 percent of total procurement funding in the last decade came from supplemental war funding. Although procurement funding increased in the base budget, supplemental war funding significantly enhanced the resources available.</p>

<p>The Mother Jones article<br />
<blockquote>
<p>says the military is hardly in dire straits when it comes to funding its big-ticket items. &#8220;The services capitalized on funding to modernize their forces, especially the major weapons programs that constitute the heart of the services&#8217; capabilities,&#8221; writes the report&#8217;s author, Russell Rumbaugh—a retired Army officer and ex-CIA military analyst.</p>
<p>The study shows there&#8217;s one big reason the brass are concerned about budget-cutting discussions in Congress: They&#8217;ve been double dipping into the taxpayer&#8217;s pocket to finance weapons purchases. Of the roughly $1 trillion spent on gadgetry since 9/11, 22 percent of it came from &#8220;supplemental&#8221; war funding—annual outlays that are voted on separately from the regular defense budget. Those bills are primarily intended to keep day-to-day operations running in Iraq and Afghanistan—meaning that if a member of Congress votes against a supplemental spending bill, she exposes herself to charges that she doesn&#8217;t &#8220;support the troops&#8221; in harm&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s plenty to cut, thanks to McKeon and his congressional cohort. This spring, they <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/06/congress-defense-budget-stealth-earmarks">preserved defense earmarks</a> after vowing that they wouldn&#8217;t; voted to <a href="http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/03/gop-house-panel-halts-gear-troops">make more Humvees the Army doesn&#8217;t want</a> (and reject Afghanistan base defense systems that it did); to keep <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/04/military-ge-f136-jsf-engine">an unnecessary $3 billion GE contract</a> to build an &#8220;alternative engine&#8221; for the single-engine Joint Strike Fighter, whose costs are approaching $1 trillion; and <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/06/eight-weirdest-defense-budget-amendments">to repatriate US victims</a> of the 1804 Barbary War in Libya.</p>
<p>In their defense, they did vote to trim defense dollars by <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/04/gop-plan-cut-defense-no-color-copies-west">banning color copies</a> at the Pentagon.</p>

                                <p>Rumors suggest that Italy is so desperate for money that it will try the full Monti*. </p>
<p>Mario Monti is about to be asked to try to form a government.  Of course the actual negotiations have begun, except it doesn&#8217;t seem that Prof.  Monti is inclined to negotiate.  His position seems to be that Italian politicians totally blew it (correct) so they will let him try to fix things (good luck with that).</p>
<p>The rumored position of the Berlusconi has moved from the prime minister should be one of his guys, to he should name half of the cabinet to he should name at least someone (who would be Gianni Letta his Rove) to OK just don&#8217;t take away my TV (spoiled kids are that way).</p>
<p>Monti has already <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2011/11/13/news/totoministri_milella-24929436/?ref=HREA-1">semi-officially announced that the new economics minister with be Guido Tabellini who is widely considered to be the most eminent Italian economist in Italy**. He is known for his work on how politicians do not serve the public interest (kids this was an original approach when he started &#8212; really).</p>
<p>The justice minister is likely to be a judge***. </a> Monti is alleged to have specifically refused to negotiate with Berlusconi about any reforms to the Justice system (which has been repeatedly reformed in ways which keep Berlusconi out of jail).</p>
<p>The bit about TV is, sadly, not a joke.  Monti is rumored to have agreed that he won&#8217;t change the regulation of TV.  He also is rumored to have agreed not to change the horrible electoral law.  I am summarizing Italian newspapers which report rumors.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how it will turn out, but it seems to be a rather radical shift. The logic seems to be that members of parliament who know they will never be re-elected will do anything to avoid early elections (their salary is actually fairly high by Italian standards and Berlusconi supporters come cheap).</p>
<p>Both Monti and Tabellini are definitely right of center.  The aim seems to be to reassure investors.  </p>

<p>*Yes I wrote the post for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bDDsZLYK1s&#038;feature=related">the joke in the title</a>.  Have a problem with that ?</p>
<p>** There are many eminent Italian born economists who have escaped all over the world.  Also there are eminent English economists and one Canadian economist who live in Italy.  Finally I am reporting the general view and not making any personal evaluation.</p>
<p>*** the one sour note is  &#8220;La quarta alternativa è quella di Carlo Nordio, magistrato inquirente a Venezia,&#8221; that is &#8220;the fourth alternative (for justice minister) is Carlo Nordio an investigating magistrate in Venice.&#8221; Nordio is a total hack.  There is an interception of one of Craxi&#8217;s lawyers noting that he and Nordio (then as now a magistrate) were working together.  Then he investigated cooperatives vaguely related to the Italian Communist Party over scandals which make Solyndra look scandalous (including was the tombola (bingo) money in a communist club kept separate from party money &#8212; really).  If Nordio is justice minister than Berlusconi will have achieved his final aim of having one of his guys in the cabinet and continuing to use politicians to obstruct justice.</p>

<p>GOP wants to repeal Dodd-Frank: instead they should listen to Nassim Taleb
<p>Nassim Taleb, the author of the book on long-tail events, suggests in a Nov. 6, 2011 op-ed in the New York Times that &#8220;it is only a matter of time before private risktaking leads to another giant bailout like the ones the United States was forced to provide in 2008.&#8221; </p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty strong language, and should be cause for worry among those GOP debaters who have been in a pissing contest over how much legislation they can suggest for repeal, like Dodd-Frank, health care reform, and environmental protection.  Instead of defending big banks, the GOP should start thinking about how to break them up.  Instead of suggesting that we need to repeal Dodd-Frank and end regulation of banks, Taleb says we do need  regulation but can&#8217;t depend on it alone: &#8220;Supervision, regulation, and other forms of monitoring are necessary, but insufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>And instead of defending risk-taking bankers as innovators and entrepreneurs, Congress should be considering measures to undo the incentives for risk taking.  Taleb says&#8211;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/opinion/end-bonuses-for-bankers.html">End Bonuses for Bankers</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]t&#8217;s time for a fundamental reform:  Any person who works for a company that, regardless of its current financial health, would require a taxpayer-financed bailout if it failed, should not get a bonus, ever.  In fact, all pay at systemically important financial institutions&#8211;big banks, but also some insurance companies and even huge hedge funds&#8211;should be strictly regulated.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bonuses are particularly dangerous because they invite bankers to game the system by hiding the risks of rare and hard-to-predict but consequential blow-ups, which I have called &#8216;black swan&#8217; events. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like sound advice.  Bonuses encourage risktaking, and risktaking encourages breakdowns of TBTF banks.  Breakdowns lead to taxpayer bailouts.  To break the chain, deny the bonuses.</p>
<blockquote><p>The asymmetric nature of the bonus (an incentive for success without a corresponding disincentive for failure) causes hidden risks to accmumlate in the financial system and become a catalyst for disaster.  This violates the fundamental rules of capitalism:  Adam Smith himself was wary of the effect of limiting liability, a bedrock principle of the modern corporation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Taleb touches on a factor in the expanding risk of our economy&#8211;and the expanding immunity of the manager class from the risk they cause.  Corporations provide limited liability to their owners.  And innovations over the last few decades have expanded limited liability to almost all investors even in pass-through entities that pay no entity-level tax, through the limited liability company and the limited liability partnerships. That is one of the reasons I have argued for Congress to enact legislation to restrain the availability of tax-free mergers and reorganizations.  The combination of easily attained limited liability plus easily attained consolidation of entities has been a factor in the growth of the corporatist state.</p>
<p>Taleb has a good point about the incidence of bonuses in the US market system as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>We trust military and homeland secrutiy personnel with our lives, yet we don&#8217;t give them lavish bonuses.  They get promotions and the honor of a job well done if they succeed, and the severe disincentive of shame if they fail.  For bankers, it is the opposite: a bonus if they make short-term profits and a bailout if they go bust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Eliminating bonuses would make banking boring again, like it was before the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.  Boring, in this case, is good.  Congress should consider what kind of legislation could be designed to make bonuses in banking less likely, through tax disincentives or other means.</p>

<p>SOCIAL SECURITY AIN&#8217;T BROKE</p>
<p>A Reply to Linda Beale</p>
<p>I want to take advantage of Linda Beale&#8217;s essay &#8220;Social Security: It Ain&#8217;t Broke Unless China is too&#8221; to make some points of my own.  I want to be clear at the outset that I am grateful to Linda for her essay.  She is essentially right.  My comments are secondary.  It&#8217;s not a case of my disagreeing with Linda, but of having something to say that I hope will help people understand the Social Security &#8220;question&#8221; a little better.  </p>
<p>I am going to assume the reader has Linda&#8217;s essay in front of him.</p>
<p>First, I don&#8217;t agree with Krugman: you CANNOT think of Social Security as &#8220;part of the budget.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t know how the government talks to itself about this,  but they sure went to a lot of effort to segregate Social Security funds from the budget with a payroll tax and a Trust Fund. . You don&#8217;t have a &#8220;trust fund&#8221; if the money is fungible.</p>
<p>We once had a reader at Angry Bear point to a CBO &#8220;paper&#8221; that said because SS funds come into the Treasury like other taxes, they cannot be regarded as separate from those other taxes. The money is not &#8220;marked&#8221; so you can tell SS money from other money.  This is a lie.  The government is quite capable of keeping track of where the money comes from and where it is dedicated by law to go.  So be warned, there are experts, even in the heart of CBO who are quite willing to lie to you if they think they can get away with it.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Second,  i don&#8217;t like the usage  &#8220;workers pay&#8230; to support [past workers, current retirees] who paid into it in the past.&#8221;   While this is technically true,  it is misleading.  Those current retirees DID pay into SS in the past.  They paid for their own benefits.  Pay as you go is merely the very clever way the first cohort&#8217;s payments are protected from inflation, and earn interest, without being exposed to the risks of the market, so they can be returned to the taxpayer in time to help pay for his retirement.  It is critical that people understand that the workers pay for their own benefits.  It is NOT &#8220;the young paying for the old.&#8221;   When they figure your benefits, they look at what YOU paid in, not what your son is paying in.</p>
<p>Like a lot of things in life, both ideas are true here.  We are paying for the older generation, just as the next generation will pay for us. But at the same time we are paying directly for ourself.  The money we pay is recorded against our name.  Just like in a bank account.</p>
<p>Third , you&#8217;ll get some disagreement  about when the Trust Fund was created and what for.  Beale is essentially right about the present Trust Fund being created to allow the boomers to pay in advance for the part of their own retirement benefits that would be needed in excess of normal pay as you go. The trust fund was there at the beginning as a simple way to buffer income against outgo, both for normal monthly ebbs and flows, and for the occasional recession when taxes collected would fall short of benefits &#8220;promised.&#8221;  But the &#8217;83 Social Security Commission knew the boomer retirement was coming, and the tax rate they set at that time &#8220;just happened&#8221; to result in a Trust Fund large enough to bridge the boomer retirement. This is the point we have reached today.  A long expected point, in spite of the liars screaming that SS has gone &#8220;cash flow negative.&#8221;  SS has not gone &#8220;negative.&#8221;  It&#8217;s cash flow includes interest, and eventually principle, from the savings it generated exactly for this purpose.</p>
<p>Fourth, I don&#8217;t agree with Beale that there is NO &#8220;problem.&#8221;  The Trust Fund is not the problem.  The problem is that as people live longer, they will need to devote a higher percent of their earnings to their retirement.. OR not retire as young, OR live on less when they do.  I don&#8217;t think any sane person would choose options 2 and 3 when option 1 is so cheap.  But it IS a &#8220;problem,&#8221;  a very small one once it is understood, which is why the bad guys work so very hard to prevent your understanding it.  You, the young, can insure your own future retirement  with no increase in retirement age or cut in monthly benefits simply by raising your own tax&#8230; really your own savings rate&#8230; one half of one tenth of one percent per year,  or about forty cents per week in today&#8217;s terms.  This is an enormously better solution than not letting people retire when they are old, or cutting their benefits below survival levels, or taxing the rich and turning Social Security into welfare as we knew it.</p>
<p>Fifth.. the Trust Fund treasuries will indeed run out some time around 2030 or 40 or 50.  It is a fatal argument to tell people don&#8217;t worry be happy.  Even &#8220;the young&#8221; can see that they will be taking a benefit cut when they retire if nothing is done.  Their problem is they don&#8217;t know they can avoid the benefit cut by raising their own &#8220;tax&#8221; by an amount so small they would not even notice it.  </p>
<p>Default or not Default is not the question.  Default would just move up the day when the tax needs to be raised, but would make no real difference in justice to anyone.  And the lying bastards won&#8217;t default in a way you could bring them to court for.  They will just cut benefits one way or another so the TF does not have to be paid back in a time inconvenient to themselves.  They CAN do that.  And that is the extent to which Uncle Sam borrowing from himself IS a problem.  But it is not the problem that the liars say it is.  Uncle Sam will have no problem finding the money. In fact, i don&#8217;t think the liars really care about the money. What they really want to do is destroy Social Security. They hate it because they hate the idea of &#8220;the help&#8221; being idle.  They can&#8217;t imagine you might think you have something more important to do with your golden years than work for them.</p>
<p>Sixth..  The liars claim that the iou&#8217;s are meaningless is based on their idea that the government has to tax the people to find the money to pay the people.  This is a confusion &#8230; we are not all the same person&#8230;  but it is one they probably sincerely believe, and it isn&#8217;t helpful (to them) for us to miss the point. It needs to be explained. The money is owed to the people who paid their payroll tax on the understanding that it would be used to pay for their retirement.  It will be paid by people who did not pay that payroll tax, and who presumably benefitted by borrowing the money.  They will not be paying twice for their Social Security.  They will be paying for the first time for what their government bought with the money they borrowed FROM Social Security.  The rich know that it is THEY who will be taxed to pay back the money they borrowed from Social Security.  And they are just short sighted enough to stop thinking right there, especially as they can rationalize that the money was borrowed not by them but by &#8220;the government&#8221;  whoever that is. But since they hate the government, they can pretend they have no obligation to pay it&#8217;s bills just by pretending they got no benefit from spending the money.</p>
<p>Again, I want to think Linda for her essay, and I hope this helps.</p>
