                                <p>The NYT <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/business/economy/14dip.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;pagewanted=print">moves deeply into delusion</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The rolling real estate crash that ravaged Florida and the Southwest is delivering a new wave of distress to <em>communities once thought to be immune— economically diversified cities where the boom was relatively restrained.</em></p>
<p>In the last year, home prices in Seattle had a bigger decline than in Las Vegas. Minneapolis dropped more than Miami, and Atlanta fared worse than Phoenix. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Putting it politely, that is h*rs*sh*t. Anyone who was paying attention in the Atlanta area—or <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/10/never-blame-on-hyperoptimism-what-can.html">who has been paying attention to Georgia Bank Failures</a>—has described the Greater Metro Area&#8217;s housing prices (let alone Atlanta itself) as a bubble. (As I noted at the link above, one of our commenters, <a href="http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http%3A%2F%2Fangrybear.blogspot.com%2F2009%2F06%2Fnoted-for-record-failed-bank-edition.html&#038;title=Noted%20for%20the%20Record%2C%20Failed%20Bank%20edition%20~%20Angry%20Bear&#038;path=%2F7261484830963939755&#038;avatars=yes&#038;standalone=no&#038;scoring=yes&#038;paginate=1000&#038;backwards=no&#038;sort=date&#038;thread=yes&#038;permalink=http%3A%2F%2Fangrybear.blogspot.com%2F2009%2F06%2Fnoted-for-record-failed-bank-edition.html&#038;skin=echo&#038;smiles=no&#038;editable=yes&#038;popup-title=Echo">Nancy Ortiz, was all over this</a> in <strong><em>June of 2009</em></strong>; and the old Business Week covered it in <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/investing/wall_street_news_blog/archives/2009/10/weekend_reading.html">an article published in October of that year</a>. Does the NYT believe that local banks fail for no reason?  As Peter Carbonara wrote in the BusinessWeek piece:<br />
<blockquote>One Material Loss Review released today, for example, describes the death throes of FirstCity Bank, which had $297 million in assets and was based in Stockbridge, Georgia, a town not far southeast of Atlanta. FirstCity, like many other banks in the metro Atlanta area, partook of <em><strong>the state&#8217;s late, lamented enormous real estate boom</strong></em>, making a large number of loans to local builders. When the boom turned into a crash in 2007, those loans turned bad. The bank failed on March 20. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Minneapolis is another clear case where the locals were talking about a bubble back in late 2006/early 2007. Commenter TrickStar was <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2008/11/case-shiller-index-falls-174/#comment-128775">all over Minneapolis at Barry Ritholtz&#8217;s place it in November of 2008</a>. (Indeed, by March of 2010, the <a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/spf/CSHomePrice_Release_033056.pdf">S&#038;P/Case-Shiller Index was claiming a &#8220;recovery&#8221; for Minneapolis</a> [link is PDF]. Talk about &#8220;green shoots.&#8221;)</p>
<p>That same PDF&#038;again, from 11 months ago, using January 2010 data—discusses Seattle, which had the fifth-largest drop in housing prices during 2009. And that was over a year ago. As the Seattle Bubble blog noted, <a href="http://seattlebubble.com/blog/2010/12/28/case-shiller-seattle-home-prices-hit-new-post-peak-low/">things only got worse last year</a>.</p>
<p>SEATTLE UPDATE:  Even <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/seattles-foreseeable-housing-bust/">David Leonhardt piles on</a>.  Hint to the NYT: Institutional Memory is an Asset <em>only when used</em>.  If you need someone to run your Knowledge Management division, give me a call and we&#8217;ll talk.</p>
<p>In short, anyone who was paying attention knew that all three cities were prime examples of housing bubbles. The idea that the NYT&#8217;s best economics writer doesn&#8217;t is frightening at best.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/02/new-program-for-offshore-accounts.html"><strong>New Program for Offshore Accounts</strong></a><br />crossposted with Ataxingmatter
<p>As I mentioned in earlier posts, the IRS has released information about a new voluntary disclosure program for offshore account holders.  The last program, which closed in October 2009, provided a low penalty of 20% of the highest aggregate balance in offshore accounts for the various failure to file information returns (FBAR and others) and elimination of any risk of a 75% fraud penalty or criminal prosecution for those accepted into the program who &#8216;truthfully, timely, and completely&#8221; comply with their disclosure obligations under the initiative.  This one is only slightly harsher, with a 25% aggregate-balance penalty.  Participants would also pay a 20% accuracy-related penalty on any tax underpayments for relevant years.</p>
<p>The information is available on the IRS website under &#8220;<a href="http://www.irs.gov/compliance/enforcement/article/0,,id=205909,00.html">How to make a Voluntary Disclsure under the 2011 OVDI </a>(standing for &#8220;Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Initiative&#8221;) and in a new Q/A on the website, <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/international/article/0,,id=235699,00.html">2011 OVCI frequently asked questions and answers</a>.  Generally, a taxpayer (or representative) asks the IRS criminal investigation division for a &#8220;pre-clearance&#8221;.  If granted, it essentially means that the taxpayer is not already a person of interest to the IRS for offshore accounts.  Then the taxpayer has thirty days to comply with the reporting obligations by filing an &#8220;<a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/ltr-voluntary-disclosure01312011__1_.pdf">offshore disclosure letter</a>&#8220;.  That letter discloses the source of the funds, informs the IRS if the taxpayer or related entities are under audit or criminal investigation, and estimates the highest values and income of the offshore accounts for the years between 2003 and 2010.  The taxpayer has to reveal the country, institution, contact at the institution, date account opened, information about any entities connected with the account(s), and details of all meetings and other communications with the account institution and with other advisers about the account.  Once accepted into the program, the taxpayer must make a &#8220;full&#8221; voluntary disclosure by August 31, 2011&#8211;this includes filing amended returns, paying the prescribed penalties, providing complete information on facilitators of the offsore accounts, and filing a closing agreement with the IRS.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The Q&#038;A uses an example of a person with a million on deposit since before 2003, earning $50,000 a year from 2003 to 2010. </p>
<p><em>They would pay $518,000 plus interest. This includes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Tax of $140,000 (8 years at $17,500) plus interest,</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>An accuracy-related penalty of $28,000 (i.e., $140,000 x 20%), and</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>An additional penalty, in lieu of the FBAR and other potential penalties that may apply, of $350,000 (i.e., $1,400,000 x 25%).</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If the taxpayers didn’t come forward, when the IRS discovered their offshore activities, they would face up to $4,543,000 in tax, accuracy-related penalty, and FBAR penalty. The taxpayers would also be liable for interest and possibly additional penalties, and an examination could lead to criminal prosecution.</em></p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this plays out.  Some of my colleagues who practice in this area tell me they believe there are at least several hundred thousand Americans who have &#8220;substantial&#8221; foreign accounts.  But there are a number of them, I understand, who have decided to take the risk of not being discovered in order to continue to avoid paying these taxes and penalties.  As these programs increase the numbers of accountholders who report contacts, banks and advisers who have assisted in this process, the risk becomes measurably greater.  Personally, I hope that those who choose to continue being scofflaws are the losers and not the government (which is just &#8220;we the people&#8221;).</p>

<p><strong>Canadian economic growth is about two percentage points higher under Liberal governments</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=346">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>Frances Woolley has a piece in <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2011/02/why-is-canadian-gdp-growth-higher-under-liberal-governments.html">Worthwhile Canadian Initiatives</a> that begins like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Canadian economic growth is about two percentage points higher under Liberal governments. At least, that&#8217;s what my colleagues Stephen Ferris and Marcel Voia found in their recent article in the <a href="http://economics.ca/cgi/jab?journal=cje&#038;article=v44n1p0107">Canadian Journal of Economics</a> (earlier ungated version <a href="http://www2.carleton.ca/economics/ccms/wp-content/ccms-files/cep09-11.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>This is a large impact. For example, if the economy was growing at 1 percent under a Conservative government, switching to a Liberal government would increase the predicted GDP growth rate to around 3 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been reading my blog posts, or <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">Presimetrics</a>, the book I co-authored with Michael Kanell, you&#8217;ll recognize this is about the same conclusion that can be drawn about the United States.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Because of the similarity in outcomes for Canada and the US, its worth considering whether the drivers are the same.  Woolley suggests two explanations for the Canadian results.  The first:</p>
<blockquote><p>One hypothesis begins with the observation that the Liberals are Canada&#8217;s natural governing party &#8211; they have been in office more often, and for longer, than any other political party. Temporary interruptions to their rule, for example, the election of R.B. Bennett, occur when something goes seriously wrong. </p></blockquote>
<p>This explanation doesn&#8217;t work for the US.  Democrats have outperformed Republicans from 1929 (the first year for which data is available from the BEA) to the present.  That&#8217;s 81 years, and Republicans have had the Oval Office for 39 of them &#8211; just slightly less than half.  In the period from 1953 to the 2008 the period we focus on in our book, Democrats still easily outperform Republicans, there are a total of 56 years, and Republicans have been President for 36 of them. </p>
<p>The second explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p>A second hypothesis is that Liberals pursue pro-poor policies and Conservatives don&#8217;t. This means that Liberals will tend to be elected when people are feeling poor, that is, at the bottom of the business cycle, whereas Conservatives will tend to be elected at the top.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one also doesn&#8217;t work in the US.  Yes, FDR and Obama were elected when economic disasters were underway, but malaise was the word of the day when Reagan was elected.  (And leaving out FDR and Obama doesn&#8217;t change results.)  On the other hand, JFK was elected and both Truman and LBJ became President when the country&#8217;s mood was exceptionally strong. (Growth under LBJ was second only to FDR, and Truman turned in the worst performance among Democrats thus far.)  </p>
<p>Frankly, I think the first sentence of the second hypothesis may have some juice to it, but you have to divorce it from the sentence that follows it: </p>
<blockquote><p>A second hypothesis is that Liberals pursue pro-poor policies and Conservatives don&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>The difference in &#8220;pro-poor&#8221; versus not &#8220;pro-poor&#8221; explains tax policy, and tax policy <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=301">correlates with growth</a> in the US.  The difference in &#8220;pro-poor&#8221; versus not &#8220;pro-poor&#8221; explains tax policy, and tax policy <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=301">correlates with growth</a> in the US.  I suspect, but I haven&#8217;t checked yet, that there are two other differences between Democrats and Republicans in the US, and Liberals and Conservatives that matter:</p>
<p>1.  Where the money gets spent.  (i.e., &#8220;pro-poor&#8221; spending v. not &#8220;pro-poor&#8221; spending)<br />2.  Regulation of externalities</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://macromarketmusings.blogspot.com/2011/01/ecb-is-getting-something-right.html">David Beckworth</a> points to <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=8601">Scott Sumner</a>, who points to <a href="http://kantoos.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/ngdp-level-targeting-works/">Kantoos</a> on the effectiveness of nominal income targeting in Germany. <a href="http://kantoos.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/germany-ngdp-and-annual-wage-growth-1991-2010.jpg">Kantoos&#8217; illustration</a> certainly suggests that the ECB has been successful in getting the dynamics of output and prices (nominal GDP) right over the last decade.</p>
<p>I have no contention with the historical evidence. Whether or not the historical data supports an effective nominal GDP target is trivial compared to the suggestion that the ECB will tolerate a pickup in German nominal GDP going forward. Wage pressures and lower unemployment will lead higher nominal GDP, but will likely increase German inflation as well; this will set the stage for tighter, rather than accommodative, ECB policy.</p>
<p>Although Kantoos did acquiesce that the ECB doesn&#8217;t officially target  nominal GDP, he didn&#8217;t, in my view, give this simple fact enough face  time. The ECB is the most hawkish of the G4 central banks. As you can see from the histogram of inflation over the last decade, the central tendency is very strong at 2-2.5%.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LaakIqA78v4/TVfql1Z3-HI/AAAAAAAADeE/2hUr87kb7Jo/s1600/inflation_histogram.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LaakIqA78v4/TVfql1Z3-HI/AAAAAAAADeE/2hUr87kb7Jo/s400/inflation_histogram.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a> As the histogram shows, the ECB rarely institutes a policy rule that drives inflation above <a href="http://www.ecb.int/mopo/html/index.en.html">its stated objective</a>: &#8220;the ECB aims at inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.&#8221; The ECB&#8217;s reaction-function to German price pressures will be of utmost importance, given Germany&#8217;s 26% weight in Eurozone inflation.</p>
<p><a href="http://kantoos.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/ngdp-level-targeting-works/">Kantoos</a> and <a href="http://macromarketmusings.blogspot.com/2011/01/ecb-is-getting-something-right.html">David Beckworth </a>posit that the 2% wage growth achieved due to highly competitive German industry (see reference at end of post) is evidence that the ECB targeted  nominal GDP and nominal per-capita GDP effectively. In contrast, I would argue that the ECB&#8217;s had it pretty  easy, where the recession simply delayed the inevitable tightening that would have occurred  in favor of the 2% inflation target.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qsvJgdPF3IU/TVbUDUy4ziI/AAAAAAAADdc/52_13_xBmco/s1600/percap_income.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qsvJgdPF3IU/TVbUDUy4ziI/AAAAAAAADdc/52_13_xBmco/s400/percap_income.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>(Read more after the jump)<a name="more"></a><br />Measured on a quarterly basis, annual per-capita nominal income growth in Germany averaged just 2.1% since Jan. 1999 (when the <a href="http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html">ECB took over monetary policy </a>across the Eurozone). Germany represents 26% of the HICP (harmonized price index used by the ECB, and the weighting data is available at <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database">Eurostat table</a> prc_hicp_inw),  so upward economic pressure on German prices and output (nominal GDP), would manifest into, all else equal (i.e., not  offset by deflation in other big countries), average  inflation above the ECB&#8217;s comfort zone &#8211; I use the word &#8216;zone&#8217;  loosely; it&#8217;s 2%. The ECB is unlikely to tolerate this.</p>
<p>Currently, tax hikes and a rebound of economic activity and commodity prices are pressuring prices in even the &#8216;fiscally austere&#8217; European economies (Spain at 2.9% annual inflation in December). So the offset to German inflation pressures on the average inflation rate are not existent at this time.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lOaUpS9wA1Q/TVfw1b2DlNI/AAAAAAAADeM/mMpBk5AQDrU/s1600/inflation_chart.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lOaUpS9wA1Q/TVfw1b2DlNI/AAAAAAAADeM/mMpBk5AQDrU/s400/inflation_chart.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>My sense is that the ECB is biding its time until German price  pressures emerge before they have to tighten monetary  policy across the Eurozone. For example, the ECB must have been happy  that s<a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/02/08/business-specialized-consumer-services-eu-germany-volkswagen_8297126.html">ome German unions are negotiating wage hikes</a> that are lower than the current rate of annual per capita nominal GDP growth, 4% Y/Y in Q2 and Q3 2010. (see chart above).</p>
<p>So how much time does the ECB have? At this time, excessive inflation is not ubiquitous in the German HICP, the ECB&#8217;s preferred measure of inflation. Currently it really is mostly a food and energy story.</p>
<p>I computed a diffusion index across all of the subcomponents of the HICP index for some Eurozone economies. The index is pretty simple: above 50, there are more   components of the HICP that are growing at a greater than 2% annual pace, while   below 50, there are more components growth below the 2% pace.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Bx_Y1--nocw/TVbi9IUg7HI/AAAAAAAADd8/vCj2xZlS1Vo/s1600/inflation_diffusion.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Bx_Y1--nocw/TVbi9IUg7HI/AAAAAAAADd8/vCj2xZlS1Vo/s400/inflation_diffusion.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The December diffusion in Germany, 28, is lower than its average since  2004, 33. Not only has Germany historically seen prices growing broadly lower than 2%, but they still are. However, despite the low the level of diffusion, the trend is upward.</p>
<p>As wage contracts reset, I expect that the breadth of price increases will increase and drive overall inflation above the historical German comfort zone, 1.5% average 1995-2007 (before the recession). In the weaker economies, Portugal (not shown),  Italy, and Spain, there has been a pickup in subcomponent-level 2% inflation as well &#8211; eventually pressures in these economies should fade with fiscal austerity.</p>
<p>However, pressures are in the pipeline. Tight capacity  utilization and labor markets will inevitably drive inflation on the cost side.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TXFJp99SHcw/TVf1Tx9hllI/AAAAAAAADeU/QYE3EQDMleo/s1600/capacity_util_chart.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TXFJp99SHcw/TVf1Tx9hllI/AAAAAAAADeU/QYE3EQDMleo/s400/capacity_util_chart.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>According to the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/surveys/documents/2011/bcs_2011_01_en.pdf">European Commission</a>,  the survey of German Q1 2011 capacity utilization, 84.9%, is above its  decade average, 83.1%. Eventually, German firms will have to pay  higher wages on the margin in order to satisfy strong(er) demand.</p>
<p>And German labor markets are tight. <a href="http://www.piie.com/publications/opeds/oped.cfm?ResearchID=789">Schroeder&#8217;s labor reform</a> has dropped the  unemployment rate, 6.6% in December 2010 on a seasonally-adjusted and harmonised basis, to well below its 15-year average, 8.5%. Inflation from  the cost side is certainly in the works, barring a surge in  productivity, that is.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K4mzFzKIAlU/TVf1T-LqGPI/AAAAAAAADec/aewF6mWFwAA/s1600/urate_chart.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K4mzFzKIAlU/TVf1T-LqGPI/AAAAAAAADec/aewF6mWFwAA/s400/urate_chart.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>In my view, German prices should be allowed to trend upward &#8211; the German real exchange rate is too low. If Spain, Italy, Portugal, or Ireland are to have any chance at all for fiscal austerity to actually drop the fiscal deficit, German prices must rise (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/eurozone-rebalancing-depends-on-german.html">I&#8217;ve written about this before</a>). In my view, though, it&#8217;s more likely that the ECB attempts to quash a discrete shift in German nominal income growth via tighter policy than accommodate it.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care: Policy Confusion</strong></p>
<p>The Obama administrative, and especially the Department of Health and Human Services, is pushing the notion of accountable care organizations (ACOs) and similar innovative integration strategies to improve the cost-benefit ratio of health care services. This is integral to PPACA (&#8220;Obamacare.&#8221;)</p>
<p>ACOs and other integrated provider networks are to provide 1) better coordination of care and 2) lower cost, perhaps through a bundled payment system. The exact form of these organizations is still evolving. </p>
<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountable_care_organization</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission appears to be preparing to hammer physicians and hospitals under the assumption ACOs and the like are anti-competitive. This is consistent with pre-PPACA enforcement policies.  Reports and lawyer gossip say there is a tug-of-war between the two agencies, with the Justice Department being more sympathetic to the integration.</p>
<p>To be fair, the FTC is supposed to enforce the laws on the books, perhaps we need some clarification from Congress?</p>
<p>A little clarity would speed the integration and further the intent of PPACA, IMHO.</p>

<p><strong>Rules to Write By</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=342">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>Things to keep in mind, especially when posting here or writing me letters:</p>
<p>1. I don&#8217;t cite authority as proof, and I ask that you have the courtesy to not do the same to me.  Its bad enough when you cite Paul Krugman.  After all, you could be quoting him incorrectly, or out of context.  Additionally, Krugman, like the rest of us, could simply be wrong.  Its even worse when you cite someone who is paid to have a specific opinion.  Cut out the middle man and make the argument yourself.</p>
<p>2.  Get your data from a reputable source. In general, that means whatever government agency generates the data though there are exceptions.  A think tank which pushes a specific point of view is not one of those exceptions.  When it comes to international data, either get it from the government agencies in countries you are looking at, or the World Bank, IMF, UN, CIA, Statistical Abstract of the US or Penn World Tables.</p>
<p>3.  If you want to compare economic growth across time periods, adjust for inflation or the size of the economy or both.</p>
<p>4.  If you want to compare economic growth across countries, adjust for inflation as well currency differences. </p>
<p>5.  If you want to compare growth rates of anything, be consistent with your starting and ending points.</p>
<p>6.  If you want to compare any two samples, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/01/further-critique-of-romer-and-romer.html">be consistent in how you assign points between the samples</a>.</p>
<p>7.  Do not argue by assertion. </p>
<p>8.  Economics is not complicated.  If you require assumptions you cannot explain or which do not pass the giggle test when stated in plain English to the average person in order to show a given effect, that effect does not exist.  <br />9.  Do not try to impress me with big words.  Especially when they are statistical terms.</p>
<p>10.  If you haven&#8217;t tried applying data to your model, your model is probably worthless. </p>
<p>11.  If most or all of the observations in your sample are a special case to your model, your model is worthless.</p>
<p>12.  One anecdote does not make a rule.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>13.  Use as much data as is available, or follow a consistent rule for how much data to use and how to deal with it.  Do not cherry pick.</p>
<p>14.  No magic lags.  Be consistent in your use of lags.  If your analysis says that Reagan is responsible for growth during the Clinton administration, he better be responsible for growth during the Bush 1 administration too.  And if Reagan is responsible for events that happened four to twelve years after he left office, explain why he isn&#8217;t responsible for events that happened 13 years after he left office.  Also, explain why some predecessor of Reagan&#8217;s isn&#8217;t responsible for growth during Reagan&#8217;s administration.</p>
<p>15.  In economics, time moves in a single direction.   For some reason a lot of people write to tell me about how growth during the Kennedy administration only picked up after the so-called Kennedy tax cuts.  But those tax cuts occurred in 1964, and Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.  And growth was very rapid during the Kennedy administration.  (I.e., quite a bit faster than under Reagan.)  I also get a lot of people informing me that growth sucked under FDR until WW2 began.  But&#8230; if you consider growth during FDR&#8217;s term only through &#8217;38 or only through &#8217;40, it is still faster than under any other President. </p>
<p>16.  Correlation does not imply causality.  Sadly, it is impossible to prove causation in the real world when you&#8217;re talking about economics.  However, if X leads to Y using a variety of different types of data, looked at a variety of different ways, it is certainly strongly suggestive.</p>
<p>17.  Lack of correlation does imply lack of causality.  If you cannot show that economic growth or tax revenues are negatively correlated with tax rates, then please don&#8217;t argue that lower tax rates lead to faster economic growth.<br />18.  Before you insist that paying taxes cannot possibly help the economy, either explain why building roads, funding basic research and fighting epidemics harms the economy or explain why there will be a more optimal provision of such services should the government ceases providing them.</p>
<p>19.  Regardless of what you want to believe, real economic growth during the Reagan administration was slower than real growth during the FDR, JFK, LBJ and Clinton administrations.  Two of these administrations raised marginal tax rates and one cut them.  What these administrations had in common was a vision for expanding the role of government.</p>
<p>20.  In the U.S., monetary policy is conducted by the Fed, not by the President.  Inflation is caused by printing too much money.  Do not attribute the inflation of the 1970s to Carter (or Nixon, for that matter).  Do not attribute the end of that inflation to Reagan.  One can reasonably state that the Fed reacted badly to something the President did and that caused inflation.  One cannot reasonably state that the President caused inflation.</p>
<p>21.  If your example of a libertarian paradise is a city state whose government owns much of the productive capacity of that city state, drop it and come up with something that actually does look like a libertarian paradise.  That is to say, a place with a very small, very non-intrusive government that does little more than setting and enforcing a very limited number of rules.  I can come up with several  I am sure you can come up with several too.</p>
<p>22.  If you believe Hong Kong has a flat tax, I suggest you inform the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department that <a href="http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/taxes/taxfiling/taxrates/salariesrates.htm#sr">they are in error</a>.  Bonus points if you tell them you found out about their mistake from a friend.</p>
<p>23.  Please do not tell me I do not understand the private sector.  Yes, I was an adjunct professor for five years, but that does not make me an academic by trade.  When I was an adjunct, my primary profession was as a consultant, working for myself.  I also have never worked directly (i.e., not as a consultant) for any government.  That is to say, I have been in the private sector my entire professional career.  And yes, I still have a day job with a Fortune 500 company.  This is the second Fortune 500 company for which I have worked.  I have also worked for a (then) Big 6 Accounting firm.</p>
<p>24.  Please do not tell me I do not understand the entrepreneurial mentality.  My wife and I own a small business we started from scratch.  My wife is a serial entrepreneur.  My sister is a serial entrepreneur.  Two of my three closest friends are serial entrepreneurs.  I also note that tax considerations have never been a big driver for myself, for my wife, for my sister, or for my buddies when starting a business. </p>
<p>25.  Social Security is more than a retirement fund &#8211; it is also an insurance fund. </p>
<p>26.  If someone (whether the government or the private sector) offers you a financial incentive to shoot your own foot, it is still your own #$%@ fault if you pull the trigger.</p>
<p>27.  <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/11/christy-romer-to-cea.html">Birds of a feather</a> <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2011/02/one-for-my-photo-album.html">flock together</a>.</p>
<p>28.  Ignore the catch-up effect at your peril.</p>
<p>29.  Have a clue about your data sets.  The BEA did not estimate GDP before to 1929.  The BLS did not estimate unemployment before to 1948.  Estimates for those series prior to those dates were produced decades after the fact by others, using more limited information, and sometimes an agenda.  So if you use Lebergott&#8217;s unemployment statistics for the 1930s, don&#8217;t be surprised if you&#8217;re asked why we should trust figures that classified a few million people working for the WPA and the CCC as unemployed.  If you tell me about economic growth in 1870, tell me where the data you are using originates and why I should consider it to be credible. </p>
<p>30.  I used to write posts looking at the effect of the tax burden on economic growth, and people would write to tell me I should use marginal tax rates.  Lately I&#8217;ve been focusing on the effect of marginal tax rates on growth, and people write to tell me I should use tax burdens.  (In two cases, a person who had the first complaint also had the second complaint.)  I cannot repeat every single thing I&#8217;ve ever written in every post every time I write a new post.  Before you decide to berate me for ignoring your favorite hobby horse or tell me that results would be different if I used A instead of B, look through the archives at <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/">Presimetrics</a> or <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Angry Bear</a> to see if I really haven&#8217;t covered that material already.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be putting this list of rules somewhere permanent on the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">Presimetrics</a> website, and expanding it as things come to me.  Feel free to suggest other things people should keep in mind.</p>

                                <p>Many people are afraid that US inflation is about to accelerate.  I think they are totally irrational, but the point is that they can be useful too.  Most people in the USA don&#8217;t know about Treasury Inflation Protected Securities with payments indexed to the CPI.  The inflation chicken littles would be delighted to invest in TIPS if they knew about them.</p>
<p>Some people know about TIPS.  Many are economists.  <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2011/02/the-specter-of-inflation/#">One is a wayward philosopher journalist.</a>  I expect that some people look at the TIPS rate and manage firms.  They certainly should &#8212; it should be a key determinant of investment.</p>
<p>The point is that if the people with irrational fear of inflation buy TIPS then they will drive up their price and drive down the return.  This should stimulate investment.  </p>
<p>I wonder if a campaign to promote TIPS would do more to stimulate investment than the recent Fed Quantitative Easing II policy.  I&#8217;m sure it can&#8217;t hurt and am trying to do my part.</p>
