                                <p>People have been asking me what I think of the Obama administration’s budget for 2012, as well as Republican plans to cut government spending.  My thought in both cases is this: it’s all understandable – even predictable – if you recognize that both sides have one primary goal right now: to win the presidential election in 2012.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><strong>The Republicans: Excellent Students of Political Economy</strong></p>
<p>Republicans in Washington, it is clear to me, have no interest in deficit reduction.  (There may be an exception to this generalization, but I can’t think of any off hand, and would welcome suggestions.)  Why do I assert this?  Simply because none of them have proposed a serious plan to significantly and realistically reduce the budget deficit.  No, <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2011/01/the_deficit_doesnt_care_what_y.html">not even Paul Ryan</a>.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, they have no discernable moral or ideological position on the size of the federal government.  True, many Republicans have talked a lot about “out-of-control government” since Obama became president, echoing and amplifying the wild-eyed ways many of them talked about the federal government’s excessive reach (black helicopters and all) under the Clinton administration.   But when a Republican is president they have no qualms about increasing the size or responsibilities of the federal government.  (Think TSA and Medicare prescription drug benefit, for example.)</p>
<p>My conclusion is that Republicans in Washington right now are driven by one very simple and clear objective: to recapture the White House in 2012.  Everything they say or do must be interpreted in that context, and then it all makes sense.</p>
<p>Next, we must recognize that they are also excellent students of political economics.  In particular, they have taken to heart the lesson that the state of the economy is probably the single most important factor in determining which party wins the election for President. (Though there’s some debate about whether the “state of the economy” in this context is <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2010/12/political_economy_0">the level of income or its growth rate</a>.)  </p>
<p>Well, the equation is then pretty simple:</p>
<p>(Desire to beat Obama in 2012) + (Obama is more beatable if economy is bad) = Do what you can to make the state of the economy bad.</p>
<p>Yes, the cynicism and cold-heartedness embodied in this equation is truly breathtaking.  But it explains a lot.</p>
<p>Why propose dramatic cuts in government spending?  Because they will help make the state of the economy bad.  <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2011/02/intermediate_ma_1.html">Very effectively</a>.</p>
<p>Why not worry about <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/02/boehner-if-jobs-are-lost-as-a-result-of-gop-spending-cuts-so-be-it.php">the unemployment effects of spending cuts</a>?  Because that’s an inevitable part of helping to make the state of the economy bad.  (In other words, increased unemployment is exactly the point, silly!)</p>
<p>Why <a href="http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/133677-states-prepare-for-reduced-aid-under-gop-led-house">reduce aid to states</a> facing their own budget crises?  Because that is also an extremely efficient way to help make the state of the economy bad.</p>
<p>It’s a simple equation, and once you understand that the Republicans also understand this equation, and furthermore, that it is the one thing they deeply believe in, then Republican behavior in Washington becomes explicable and even predictable. </p>
<p><strong>The Obama Administration: It’s All About the Middle 20%</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Obama administration has just put out its budget for 2012.  The cuts proposed by the administration have mystified many on the left.  But they’re easy to explain if you believe that, given Republican control of Congress, the budget is purely a political document.  As anything other than a political document <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/how_the_world_works/2011/02/14/the_irrelevance_of_obama_s_budget">the budget proposal is irrelevant</a>.  </p>
<p>And therefore the main usefulness of the 2012 budget proposal (from the Obama administration’s point of view) is if can somehow help Obama’s reelection chances.</p>
<p>For the Obama administration, the calculus works like this:</p>
<p>1. The chance of reelection depends mainly on the state of the economy.  We need to do what we can to prevent the Republicans from actively making the economy worse over the next year, they think to themselves, but that’s probably <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/the-great-abdication/">the limit of what is possible regarding the economy</a>.  So let’s move on.</p>
<p>2.  Given the state of the economy, the Obama administration reasons, the primary goal of purely political acts (such as the preparation of the 2012 budget proposal) must be to do whatever else can be done to persuade the “middle 20%” of Americans to vote for Obama. (40% of Americans will vote against him no matter what, and 40% will vote for him no matter what.)  Note that this is the opposite of the Roveian strategy of firing up and turning out the base to win elections, but it is clearly what Obama’s political advisors believe.</p>
<p>3.  The middle 20% will be more likely to vote for him if they think he’s in the middle himself – compromising, striking a balance between left and right, etc. </p>
<p>4. The 2012 budget proposal is a very good way for the Obama administration to persuade the middle 20% that Obama is in the middle himself.  It offers some real cuts – including cuts that the left hates.  It makes some gestures toward deficit reduction.  But it is not as vicious as the Republican alternative, and leaves the entitlement programs that are loved by the middle 20% completely alone.</p>
<p>This calculus suggests to me that the 2012 budget proposed by the administration has exactly accomplished their goal: it has generated howls of protest from both left and right, thus helping to persuade the middle 20% that he’s in the middle, too.</p>

<p>In response to my post commenting on Frances Woolley&#8217;s post, Frances Woolley left the following <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/02/canadian-economic-growth-is-about-two.html">comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On WCI, one of the commentators suggested that the Liberal/Conservative growth differential is partly due to differences in military spending. In Canada where we don&#8217;t have a large defence industry, money spent on &#8220;guns and bombs&#8221; probably has a low multiplier. So the spending story could well be part of it.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also differences in monetary policy (Liberals are more expansionary) and immigration policy (Liberals are more pro-immigration) &#8211; though in general anti-immigrant sentiment rises in economic downturns so it&#8217;s hard to figure out what the causal mechanism is there. On the other hand, a lot of commentators on WCI have argued that, because political platforms change so much over time, it&#8217;s hard to identify any political party with any particular policy stance.</p></blockquote>
<p>I figured I probably needed at least one graph to respond properly, so its easier to do it in a post.   I would note first &#8211; I am not that familiar with Canadian data and I don&#8217;t have the time right now to plunk down some cash at Statistics Canada, so I&#8217;ll stick to the US side of things.  </p>
<p>1.  Guns and Butter.  For the US, using data from 1929 to the present, this doesn&#8217;t work.  Yes, in recent decades, Republicans have been more military oriented than Democrats.  However, FDR was president during WW2, Truman was president during Korea, and the bulk of Vietnam occurred under LBJ.  (FDR and LBJ had monster growth, Truman had crummy growth.)<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>2.  Monetary policy doesn&#8217;t work at all in the US.  First, monetary policy is the prerogative of the Fed in the US, and Figure 1-10 in Presimetrics (available in the free download of <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/presi_ch1.pdf">Chapter One</a>) shows you that Republicans benefited more from the expansion of the real money supply.  And I was playing with the graphing tools at the FRED site (Federal Reserve Economic Database of St. Louis) and spit out this:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kfgsADUYhss/TVnIQJBP1_I/AAAAAAAAAis/4etqDDUJXJs/s1600/M1_indices.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kfgsADUYhss/TVnIQJBP1_I/AAAAAAAAAis/4etqDDUJXJs/s400/M1_indices.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>The curves show the percentage increase in nominal M1 over the length of each administration since the start of that administration.  Blue curves are Democratic administrations, Red are Republican.  Its pretty clear that in general, the expansion of nominal money was greater under Republicans too.</p>
<p>3.  Immigration.  Could be.  I haven&#8217;t checked.</p>
<p>4.  Policy changes over time.  In the US, at least, there has been one thing that has differentiated both parties since 1929, with two exception &#8211; Truman, the worst performing Democrat thus far, and Obama, in his first two years, also no great prize, have both behaved in a Republican way by this standards:  the change in the tax burden.  As I&#8217;ve noted time and again, you can change the tax burden two ways &#8211; one is through the law (by cutting or raising marginal rates or what income gets taxed, etc.).  The other is through enforcement.  And we find that among Democrats barring Truman and Obama, they all raised the tax burden, even LBJ who drastically cut marginal rates.  On the flip side, every Republican, even Bush 1, who famously raised marginal rates, lowered the tax burden.</p>

<p>Liberal attacks on Social Security are the unkindest cut of all.
<p>The Center for American Progress’s Matt Miller has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/09/AR2011020903118_Comments.html">argued</a> that liberals can learn a valuable lesson from NY Governor Andrew Cuomo’s proposed budget. With his state facing a fiscal crisis, the Governor has proposed to cap growth of state spending on the Medicaid program. Miller has argued that we should follow his example and apply a similar cap to Social Security spending.</p>
<p>Briefly, New York’s Medicaid spending was slated to grow by 13%, much faster than the overall inflation rate. Governor Cuomo has proposed to ignore funding formulas and to limit growth to 6%. Miller wants liberals to follow that example by changing Social Security’s formula used to adjust benefits.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Miller rightly notices that Social Security expenditures are also projected to grow faster than inflation. Of course, some of that is due to our aging society, with more retirees to support. But funding formulas for Social Security also contribute to growth of individual benefits beyond cost of living adjustments. In other words, Social Security expenditures in real terms (after inflation) increase faster than growth of the retired population, meaning that the benefits received in the future by a retiree will be higher in real terms than they are today.</p>
<p>Here’s why. In the 1970s it was recognized that if real living standards rise over time (due to growing productivity of workers), then Social Security retirement benefits would fall behind even if they are adjusted for inflation. Suppose you retired today at age 65 and were fortunate enough to live another 25 years to the ripe old age of 90. Let us say you retire at the typical benefit of $18,000 paid to one who has earned a medium wage pre-retirement. If that benefit is adjusted every year to account for inflation, when you die in 2036 you will still be able to buy the same consumer basket in your last year of life (assuming the COLA adjustments accurately reflect inflation — something that is not really true). But over that 25-year period you will watch as the average American living standard rises relative to your own. You will become relatively impoverished.</p>
<p>Over a period that long, it is likely that living standards will have increased substantially; over the course of US history they have typically doubled each generation. You will have fallen far behind in relative terms — from a not-so-comfortable living standard ($18,000 is by no means extravagant today) to a living standard that is half as good in relative terms.</p>
<p>For comparison purposes, based on current formulas, your Social Security retirement is projected to grow in real terms from that $18,000 now to $24,000 in 2030 and to $29,000 in 2050 (should you be so lucky to live to the age of 104!). Your living standard will grow by 60% as it keeps pace with the growth of American workers’ living standards. In relative terms, you do not fall behind. If everyone else is driving flying saucers to Venetian vacations, you’ll be able to do the same.</p>

<p>There are of course two objections. First, we do not know how much living standards will rise. It will depend on growth of labor productivity. But by linking growth of Social Security benefits to real wage growth we are ensuring that no matter how much productivity grows (whether it is zero or 400 percent), seniors will get their share.</p>
<p>Second, one could argue that in absolute terms, seniors are no worse off if we limit benefit growth to cover inflation. They’ll probably still live better in America than they would in India, after all.</p>
<p>But one thing we do know is that well-being depends more on relative comparisons than on absolute terms. Relative poverty is more detrimental to one’s physical, psychological, and emotional health than is absolute poverty. At first that might sound counterintuitive, but researchers from many disciplines have consistently found this to be true. It is relative poverty that isolates an individual, that reduces her ability to participate fully in society. So while it is commonplace to note that America’s poor are rich by Indian standards, that comparison is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Miller’s justification for elimination of the real living standard adjustment is based on two fallacies.</p>
<p>First, he argues that financing growth of Social Security benefits will “crowd out” all the other liberal priorities. The federal government simply will not be able to “afford” the costs of “guaranteeing great teachers for poor children, universal preschool, repairs for America’s crumbling roads and sewer” if we let living standards of seniors rise.</p>
<p>Second, he refers to growing numbers of retired baby boomers as the cause of the problem. It is a little publicized fact that when the intergenerational warriors trot out their “unfunded entitlements” that supposedly total tens of trillions of dollars, the shortfall is entirely due to the projected deficits in the long distant future after all baby boomers are dead and buried. The projected date of Armageddon, when Social Security first starts to run deficits (that is, when its total revenues fall short of its benefit payments) changes from year-to-year as assumptions change based on recent economic performance. But typically that date is sometime in the 2040s.</p>
<p>Think about it. The babyboomers will be closing in on the century mark by then. Yes, a few of them might make it. But most of us partied way too hard in the 1960s and 1970s. Heck, we were surprised to make it to the 1980s.</p>
<p>I do not have the space to go through all the reasons why the very long-term (75 years and beyond) projections of Social Security’s finances show growing budget deficits — but it mostly comes down to implausibly pessimistic and inconsistent assumptions about economic variables. In any case, it turns out that the projected financial shortfall amounts to about 2% of GDP per year after 2040 or so. In other words, if we find a way to shift 2% more of GDP annually toward Social Security’s funding over the next 30 years, the “looming financial crisis” disappears. By the way, we achieved a greater shift than that between 1960 and the 1990s. Only an ideologue could trump that up to a crisis.</p>
<p>But forget the finances. What really matters is growth of our nation’s ability to take care of the young, the workers, and the aged. Will we be able to produce enough goods and services to provide a rising living standard to all (supplemented by imports — if the rest of the world continues to prefer to “consume” green paper money over their own output, a topic for another day)? On all plausible projections the answer is a resounding “yes”. Indeed, even the pessimistic projections made by the Social Security Trustees shows rising living standards for all even as we age as a society.</p>
<p>That makes sense. The average worker in 1965 supported more dependents (young plus old) than workers are ever projected to support again. Why is that? Elementary: the parents of baby boomers supported 3.7 kids; the flip side of an aging society is that workers today and into the future are supporting more old people but fewer kids. It’s a tradeoff. We may not like it, but the alternatives are unpleasant: euthanasia for the elderly or very much higher birthrates. Far better to accept the aging society and to continue to ramp up productivity so that we can provide for them.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is precisely that productivity growth that drives the growth of real benefits that Miller wants to cut! If we don’t get rising productivity, we don’t get rising real benefits. Miller is focused on something that is not an issue, and has created a “solution” for something that is not a problem.</p>

<p>David Cay Johnston, former New York Times tax reporter and now a columnist at Tax Analyst&#8217;s Tax Notes, writes this week about  the way both the Obama White House and the Republican party conspire to provide every-increasing benefits through the tax system to some while stiffing the working poor.  <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/files/david-cay-johnston.-obama-and-the-gop-united-against-the-working-poor.-tn-14feb11.pdf">Download David Cay Johnston.

<p>The beginning paragraphs make the critical points.</p>
<p>The tax compromise passed in December has been hailed everywhere as a payroll tax cut combined with an extension of the Bush tax cuts, despite the fact that it raised taxes on a third of Americans. The killing of Obama’s Making Work Pay tax credit, which the White House called the biggest middle-income tax cut ever, and the replacement of it with the Republicans’ payroll tax cut raised taxes on single workers whose wages come to $20,000 or less and married couples with less than $40,000 in wages. That’s 51 million taxpayers, the Tax Policy Center estimated.</p>
<p>[Two-thirds of the poorest quintile had a tax increase of $134 (about 1.3% of total cash income), whereas] at the top, just 1.8 percent of the top 1 percent ([those with] more than $564,600) were hit with a tax inrease.  Just 1.3 percent among the top tenth of 1 percent ([those with] more than $2 million) got a tax hike.  These best-off one in 1,000 Americans got a tax cut worth on average $45,000 each, all financed with borrowed money.</p>

<p>The more I get to know this recovery, the more I’m starting to like it.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s been rather standoffish, giving the cold shoulder to millions of unemployed Americans. And true, through much of 2010 it was maddeningly elusive, never giving us confidence that it was here to stay. But the more data I review from the second half of 2010, the more I start liking what I see. Particularly because the data suggests to me that this recovery, while not roaring, is being built on a solid foundation, and therefore has the potential to grow into something pretty meaningful as this year progresses.</p>
<p>There are four things in particular that make me guardedly happy about this recovery.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><strong>1. The manufacturing sector. </strong><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ne0uGUCxusE/TVnGz4SA6hI/AAAAAAAAAYE/WOLwDVbEtI4/s1600/manuf%2Bjobs1.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ne0uGUCxusE/TVnGz4SA6hI/AAAAAAAAAYE/WOLwDVbEtI4/s320/manuf%2Bjobs1.PNG"></a><br />I’ve spent a lot of time over the last week explaining why I am <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/lean-mean-manufacturing-machine.html">bullish on US manufacturing</a>. The manufacturing sector is too small to make a significant dent in the US’s vast unemployment problem. However, it has been the source of some net job creation (see table), and more generally is a good indicator of the competitiveness of the US economy in terms of international trade. Which brings us to&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>2. US exports. </strong><br />Exports from the US did very well in the second half of 2010, which helped to give the US economy a substantial boost toward the end of the year. Best of all, this strong export performance was driven by <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/selling-stuff-to-china.html">sales to the growing, dynamic, developing countries of the world like China</a>. That makes it likely that continued rapid growth in China and other developing countries will actually provide a noticeable boost to the US economy in 2011 and going forward. Compare this with what happened during the recovery from the previous recession. As shown in the chart below, in 2002-03 US export growth only provided a modest 0.45% boost to GDP. This time around, however, US export growth has been adding over a full percentage point to US GDP growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IvpgBH-KSzo/TVnHlGs_JQI/AAAAAAAAAYM/9X5ZJSTzh8w/s1600/recovery%2B1.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IvpgBH-KSzo/TVnHlGs_JQI/AAAAAAAAAYM/9X5ZJSTzh8w/s400/recovery%2B1.PNG"></a><br /><strong>3. Business purchases of investment goods.</strong><br />Unlike the recovery from the last recession, when businesses were extremely slow to begin purchasing new equipment and machinery, in 2010 business spending on things other than buildings grew at a healthy rate. In fact, investment spending in “equipment and software” (the “e&#038;s” in the chart above) added over a full percentage point to GDP growth through 2010. The best part of this kind of spending is that it provides a much greater boost to productivity, and thus long-term economic growth, than personal consumption spending. The fact that in 2010 far more of the growth in real GDP came from business investment (and less from residential investment) than was true during the previous recovery is a very good sign for medium and long-term economic growth in the US.</p>
<p><strong>4. Household financial retrenching. </strong><br />The biggest drag on economic growth during this recovery has been the ongoing financial rebalancing that US households have been doing by paying down debt. But while this has meant that consumption has not grown as rapidly as it might have, it also means that this recovery is not (unlike the previous one) being built on borrowed money. Household debt levels have fallen dramatically over the past two years (see the chart below), and while arguably still higher than they should be, the fact that households have been reducing their debt in a pretty determined way suggests that households will be able to increase, and sustainably increase, their spending in 2011 and beyond as incomes grow faster.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wp7S5e6nq84/TVnISlF8NlI/AAAAAAAAAYU/geat1AK9I3M/s1600/recovery%2B2.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wp7S5e6nq84/TVnISlF8NlI/AAAAAAAAAYU/geat1AK9I3M/s400/recovery%2B2.PNG"></a><br />Yes, all in all, I think there are some very nice things to like about this recovery. Now we just need it to set to creating new jobs in a serious way. But based on the strong foundations on which this recovery is being built, I think it won’t be much longer before we see meaningful falls in unemployment levels in the US.</p>
<p>I must say: after being very bearish on the US economy through all of the 2000s (and particularly during my previous stint writing for Angry Bear, 2003-06), it’s nice to finally have something hopeful to write about this surprisingly alluring recovery&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Key European CDS are starting to turn in the more northern direction again, as the German-French &#8216;pact for competitiveness&#8217; faces <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,745383,00.html">near-unanimous pushback across Europe</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ALLZu81DlW8/TVmUyM4j-XI/AAAAAAAADek/LeczhVBaunc/s1600/cds_spreads.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ALLZu81DlW8/TVmUyM4j-XI/AAAAAAAADek/LeczhVBaunc/s400/cds_spreads.JPG" border="0"></a>Credit default swaps (CDS) are a market security used by investors to buy 5-yr protection (in this case) against default (or the like). As the spread rises the implied probability of default does too. Current market values imply a 39% probability of default by the Irish sovereign (listed in legend), 20% by that of Spain, and 14% by the Italian sovereign, etc. Cash bond spreads are blowing out again, too, where Spain now must pay a 216 bps premium over Germany on a 10-yr loan (the sovereign bond). I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s not totally irrational.</p>
<p>I completely understand why these negotiations are stalling. I&#8217;m Spain &#8211; it&#8217;s not clear that Spain commented against the pact based on <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,745383,00.html">this article</a>, but I digress &#8211; why would I agree to a deal that forces more &#8216;competitive&#8217; measures, which really just means quashing indexed wage growh, reducing the government deficit, adhering to a fiscal policy rule (which, by the way should be modeled after Germany&#8217;s debt brake), and adopting a standardized tax rate? Okay, I will if you (Germany) will. Meaning, I&#8217;ll increase my competitiveness by stripping away aggregate demand if you allow prices to rise. I&#8217;m Germany &#8211; no way. (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/eurozone-rebalancing-depends-on-german.html">Please see my previous post </a>which argues that a successful transition to a more stable Eurozone depends on higher Germany inflation.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,742565-3,00.html">Der Spiegel spells it </a>out pretty succinctly in an article that is now two weeks old but still totally relevant:<br /><em><br />
<blockquote><em>Germany will only agree to additional guarantees for the euro rescue fund &#8212; as the Commission and other parties have called for &#8212; if its partners approve its competitiveness pact.<br /></em></p></blockquote>
<p></em><br />Simply put: we (Germany) will only agree to eventually bail you out if you agree to our harsh demands at that time, or you agree to our harsh demands now. You&#8217;re choice.</p>
<p>This political drama is far from over. (More exciting analysis below the jump)</p>
<p>(Dan here&#8230;Kantoos responds to Rebecca&#8230;http://kantoos.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/rebecca-wilder-on-eurozone-monetary-policy-and-german-inflation/ )<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another little fact to think about: The price to buy protection against a default by the Japanese sovereign is just 77 bps, that&#8217;s only 23 bps above that for the German sovereign. This is ironic because Germany is the premiere demander of fiscal austerity, while Japan is not (to say the least) with gross debt equal to 221% of GDP (<a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fm/2011/01/update/fmindex.htm">according to the IMF</a>) &#8211; <em>or is it</em>?</p>
<p>The table below lists common characteristics usually associated with rising CDS spreads (CDS spreads are current as of 4pm today and may vary according to pricing source): the stock of debt held by foreigners (any currency denomination) and the stock of gross public debt. The final column illustrates the ability of a country to print fiat currency that is not backed by anything but government decree.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s pretty clear: Japan and the US have very elevated government debt, but low external holdings AND can print their own money to finance liabilities (which by the way are in most part denominated in their respective currencies). Clearly markets&#8217; attach weight to this simple fact via low CDS spreads.</p>

<p>Economist James K. Galbraith attends a Pete Peterson-funded road show.
<p>The <a href="http://www.pgpf.org/Issues/Fiscal-Outlook/2010/09/28/The-Fiscal-Solutions-Tour.aspx">Fiscal Solutions Tour</a> is the latest Peter G. Peterson Foundation effort to rouse the public against deficits and the national debt — and in particular (though they manage to avoid saying so) to win support for measures that would impose drastic cuts on <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/category/social-securitys-fiscal-fitness/">Social Security</a> and Medicare. It features Robert Bixby of the Concord Coalition, former Comptroller General David Walker and the veteran economist Alice Rivlin, whose recent distinctions include serving on the Bowles-Simpson commission. They came to Austin on February 9 and (partly because Rivlin is an old friend) I went.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Mr. Bixby began by describing the public debt as “the defining issue of our time.” It is, he said, a question of “how big a debt we can have and what can we afford?” He did not explain why this is so. He did not, for instance, attempt to compare the debt to the financial crisis, to joblessness or foreclosures, nor to energy or climate change. Oddly none of those issues were actually mentioned by anyone, all evening long.</p>
<p>A notable feature of Bixby’s presentation were his charts. One of them showed clearly how the public deficit soared at the precise moment that the financial crisis struck in late 2008. The chart also shows how the Clinton surpluses had started to disappear in the recession of 2000. But Mr. Bixby seemed not to have noticed either event. Flashing this chart, he merely commented that “Congress took care” of the budget surplus. Still, the charts did show the facts — and in this respect they were the intellectual highpoint of the occasion.</p>
<p>A David Walker speech is always worth listening to with care, for Mr. Walker is a reliable and thorough enumerator of popular deficit-scare themes. Three of these in particular caught my attention on Wednesday.</p>
<p>To my surprise, Walker began on a disarming note: he acknowledged that the level of our national debt is not actually high. In relation to GDP, it is only a bit over half of what it was in 1946. And to give more credit, the number Walker used, 63 percent, refers to debt held by the public, which is the correct construct — not the 90+ percent figure for gross debt, commonly seen in press reports and in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_public_debt">comparisons</a> with other countries. The relevant number is today below where it was in the mid-1950s, and comparable to the early 1990s.</p>
<p>But Mr. Walker countered that fact with another, which I’d never heard mentioned before: in real terms he said — that is, after adjusting for inflation — per capita national debt is now twice what it was back then.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/contact/test/">Sign up for weekly ND20 highlights, mind-blowing stats, event alerts, and reading/film/music recs.</a></p>
<p>The problem is that real per capita national debt is a concept with no economic meaning or importance. (No government agency reports it, either.) Even in the private sector, debt levels matter only in relation to income and wealth: richer people can (and do) take on more debt. Real per capita national income is well over three times higher today than it was in 1946 — so how could it possibly matter that the “real per capita national debt” is twice as high?</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Walker made a comparison between the United States and Greece, with the implication being that this country might, some day soon, face that country’s interest costs. But of course this is nonsense. Greece is a small nation that has to borrow in a currency it cannot control. The United States is a large nation that pays up in a money it can print. There is no chance the markets will mistake the US for Greece, and of course they have not done so.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Walker warned that “foreign lenders… can’t dump their debt but can curb their appetite” for new US Treasury bonds. This was an oblique reference to the yellow peril. The idea, when you think about it, is that the Chinese central bank will acquire dollars — which it does when China runs an export surplus — and then fail to convert them into Treasury bonds, thereby choosing, voluntarily, to hold dollars in cash, which earns no interest, instead of as Treasury bills, which do. Mr. Walker did not try to explain why this would appeal to the Chinese.</p>
<p>Walker closed by calling for action tied to an increase in the debt ceiling; specifically for a hard cap on the debt-to-GDP ratio with “enforcement mechanisms,” which could include pro rata cuts in Social Security and Medicare benefits and tax surcharges. He did not specify whether the cap should apply to gross federal debt or only to that part of the debt held by the public (a number which the Federal Reserve can change, any time it wants, by buying or selling public debt). When pressed, in the question period, he would not even say what he thought the cap should be.</p>
<p>I waited for Ms. Rivlin to add something sensible. But she did not. Apart from some platitudes — she favors “serious tax reform” and “restructuring Medicare” — her interesting contribution was to restate Mr. Walker’s comment about “foreign lenders,” who might say “we’re not going to lend you any more money.” That this would amount to saying “we’re not going to sell you any more goods” seems — from a question-and-answer and brief exchange afterward — genuinely not to have crossed her mind.</p>
<p>The Fiscal Solutions Tour comes with a nice brochure, and even (in my case) with a flash drive containing Mr. Bixby’s powerpoints. But does Mr. Peterson think he’s getting his money’s worth? The President, in his State of the Union, mostly ignored him. The Bowles-Simpson effort (which he paid for in part) and the closely allied Rivlin-Domenici plan are fading from view. And as the House Republicans forge their own course, demanding radical spending cuts right now — for political rather than economic reasons, which they don’t even bother to explain — the tired and shabby arguments of these old deficit-worriers hardly seem connected, any more, to the battles at hand.</p>
