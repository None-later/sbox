Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/03/the_white_house.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://krugman.page.nytimes.com/b/a/258176.htm">Paul Krugman</a> saying only 45%.  That’s a 45% nominal increase which is more like a 25% increase in real terms.   I don’t have the data but what do wish to bet that the number of patients has increased by more than 25%.  Does this White House insist on lying about everything?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZjdjZGM4NzNlYjNkMjgyYmQxMmZmZDMzODQxNGRkODc=">Thomas Nugent</a> claims:</p>
<blockquote><p>Few politicians, especially those enamored with higher tax rates for the rich, focused on the real reason for the big market decline: the prospect of an increase in the capital-gains tax rate in China.</p></blockquote>
<p>You don’t say?  I didn’t even know that there was a “prospect of an increase in the capital-gains tax rate in China”.  Of course, Nugent offers nothing to back up this idle speculation.  But the real reason for the latest nonsense from Nugent is that he can join in on some good old <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/senator-clintons-letter-to-treasury.html">Clinton bashing</a>.  You see, the Senator does not share Nugent’s advanced views of credit markets:</p>
<blockquote><p>So let’s dispel some of the mythology surrounding U.S. global debt. Politicians in this country would have us believe that Americans are out there, hat-in-hand, asking for money from foreigners &#8211; money that is going to have to be repaid someday. Fortunately this is a false assumption (although it still can lead to flawed economic policies). Americans buy enormous amounts of goods from abroad (assets) and pay for these goods in dollars (liabilities). Hence, world trade is a zero sum game!  An example will help explain the financial dynamics.  Assume you want to buy a car built in Japan. To finance this purchase, you go to your U.S. bank to take out a loan &#8211; a loan that will create the deposit that you will use to buy the car. Soon enough, the loan is approved: The bank has issued a new loan, Japan has its name on the deposit, and you own a new car. But something else has occurred: Technically speaking, domestic credit has funded foreign savings. Notice there is no “imported capital” involved. In fact, there is no such thing with today’s floating exchange-rate policies. Additionally, all three parties in the transaction are happy: Japan now has dollars rather than the car, something it wanted in the first place since it put the car up for sale in the U.S.; the bank, in the business of expanding loans, has done just that; and you’re on the road in your vehicle of choice. There is no imbalance in any of this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course if you decide to keep on borrowing to buy an expensive house, several nice vacations, and expensive restaurant meals – one day your debts might overwhelm you.  Which was the Senator’s point.  Alas, Nugent was too busy listening to words the Senator never said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Beware politicians like Hillary Clinton who promote capital controls and protectionist measures to insure our sovereignty and stability.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Senator was not calling for capital controls.  She was calling for fiscal responsibility – a topic that Nugent has never grasp.  Well at least Nugent did not say the Senator was xenophobic.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: PGL Smackdown by the AB readers who pointed out <a href="http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&#038;art=8648&#038;size=A">this article</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A speech to the People’s National Congress by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao announcing his government’s intention to seek a rate of economic growth of 8 percent this year down from 10.7 per cent in 2006 also had a negative impact.  Experts fear that investors might panic and sell off to reduce potential losses &#8230; Rumours that China might impose a capital gains tax on stock market earning have fuelled the sell-off. Chinese tax authorities denied speculation that it is planning such a tax but many expect China to take steps to reduce money supply for fear of inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I will say a couple of things in my defense.  This article attributes the primary cause of the stock market decline to be the announcement of the premier that the government was about to adopt a tighter monetary policy.  Now anytime a stock market crashes, all sorts of rumors as to the cause come out of the woodwork.  So yea – there may have been rumors about an increase in capital gains taxation, but that’s not exactly hard evidence of a cause and effect relationship.</p>

<blockquote><p>BAGHDAD, Monday, March 5 — Iraqi special forces and British troops stormed the offices of an Iraqi government intelligence agency in the southern city of Basra on Sunday, and British officials said they discovered about 30 prisoners, some showing signs of torture</p></blockquote>
<p>Three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a conservative Shiite, condemned the raid in Basra, but he publicly said nothing about the evidence of torture.</p>
<p>“The prime minister has ordered an immediate investigation into the incident of breaking into the security compound in Basra and stressed the need to punish those who have carried out this illegal and irresponsible act,” said the full text of a statement issued late Sunday by his office.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some comments:<br />1.  These are our allies.  Sure, they don’t seem to achieve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dostum">the level of butchery of some of our Afghan friends</a>, but these are our friends in Iraq.  Congratulations, your tax dollars pay for this.<br />2.  Our puppet (let’s call it like it is) in Iraq seems to get upset about only a few things.  These are searching for missing American personnel, cracking down on al Sadr, and doing something about torture.<br />3.  As the British leave southern Iraq, what happens to the incentive of, um, Iraqi intelligence to engage in torture?<br />4.  So what was the point of unloading Saddam again?  WMDs?  There were none.  Threatening the US?  How?  Oil?  Well, the Michael Ledeens would insist we would never be so vulgar.  Oh yeah, Saddam was an evil man.  And the administration replaced that evil man with?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/03/60_minutes_jihad_on_social_sec.html#015736">Dean Baker</a> objects to the 60 Minutes interview with <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/03/01/60minutes/main2528226.shtml">David Walker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>if they wanted to be accurate, the 60 Minutes crew could have pointed out that almost the whole horror story is driven by projections of exploding health care costs, not “entitlements” for the elderly (e.g. Social Security).</p></blockquote>
<p>While this is a fair point, most of this interview did focus on health care costs:</p>
<blockquote><p>David Walker is an accountant, the nation’s top accountant to be exact, the comptroller general of the United States. He has totaled up our government&#8217;s income, liabilities, and future obligations and concluded the numbers simply don’t add up. And he’s not alone. Its been called the &#8220;dirty little secret everyone in Washington knows&#8221; – a set of financial truths so inconvenient that most elected officials don’t even want to talk about them, which is exactly why David Walker does &#8230; &#8220;What’s going on right now is we’re spending more money than we make…we’re charging it to credit card…and expecting our grandchildren to pay for it. And that’s absolutely outrageous,&#8221; he told the editorial board of the Seattle Post Intelligencer. You have heard this before, from Ross Perot 15 years ago. You might have even thought the problem had been solved, when President Clinton announced, &#8220;Tonight, I come before you to announce that the federal deficit … will be simply zero.&#8221; &#8220;Well, those days are gone. We&#8217;ve gone from surpluses to huge deficits and our long range situation is much worse,&#8221; Walker says &#8230; The problem with Medicare, Walker says, is people keep living longer, and medical costs keep rising at twice the rate of inflation. But instead of dealing with the problem, he says, the president and the Congress made things much worse just three years ago when they expanded the Medicare program to include prescription drug coverage. &#8220;The prescription drug bill was probably the most fiscally irresponsible piece of legislation since the 1960s,&#8221; Walker argues.</p></blockquote>
<p>You see – that is the difference between Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.  President Clinton likely wanted to expand the role of the government in providing health care including a prescription drug benefit but realized that he had raised taxes by as much as possible given the opposition of the GOP to any tax increase.  President Bush on the other hand brags about “giving us our money back” AND a prescription drug benefit often in the same speech.  And when faced with a choice between making the new benefit less costly to future taxpayers versus making it as lucrative for Big Pharma as possible – he choose the latter.  No wonder Dean gets to make this argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>As is clear to anyone who is moderately competent at arithmetic, the projected budget problems are due to a projected explosion in health care costs, not demographics. If U.S. health care costs were more in line with those in any other wealthy country, there wouldn&#8217;t be much of a budget crisis to talk about.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back to the 60 Minutes for the real problem here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Asked if he knows any politicians willing to raise taxes or cut back benefits, Walker says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know politicians that like to raise taxes. I don&#8217;t know politicians that like to cut spending, but I think what we have to recognize is this is not just about numbers. We are mortgaging the future of our children and grandchildren at record rates, and that is not only an issue of fiscal irresponsibility, it&#8217;s an issue of immorality.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Could we hear at least one of the candidates for President admit that we’ll either have to cut spending or raise taxes – or both?</p>

                                <p>I’ve had a few posts lately in which I noted that by coincidence, changes in the real money supply (M2) per capita look exactly like they would if the Fed were trying to influence Presidential elections.  </p>
<p>Table 1 below shows the 12 month percentage change in real M2 per capita for years in which there is no presidential election, in which there is a presidential election with no incumbent, in which there is a presidential election and an incumbent from a different party than the Fed chair, and in years in which there is a presidential election with an incumbent from the same party as the Fed chair.  As to color coding – green indicates the, um, friendliest short term monetary policy, orange the least friendly short term monetary policy.  The data goes back to 1959.</p>
<p>(Results may differ marginally from those in the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and_01.html">previous post</a> as I inadvertently failed to include data from 1962 in the table last time around… apologies.)  </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RewKX6AuXAI/AAAAAAAAAHs/3x-ZvxxWxRw/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+4,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RewKX6AuXAI/AAAAAAAAAHs/3x-ZvxxWxRw/s320/Fed+Independence+4,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>In comments, readers have objected that the Fed doesn’t claim to target the money supply, or that it doesn’t have direct control of the money supply.  The latter objection seems a bit odd to me…  the Fed controls the money supply very directly through open market operations (buying and selling treasuries), the required reserve ratio, and moral suasion (pronouncements to banks during the monthly meetings with commercial banks – when the Fed tells banks that it would be a nice thing if the banks loaned out less money over the next month, why, by golly, the banks tend to think it would be a nice thing too).  In fact, I would imagine that the interest rate, in particular the Fed Funds rate (which is the interest rate that the Fed does control) is probably only the second most important way of affecting the money supply.</p>
<p>Table 2 is similar to Table 1, except it shows the Fed Funds rate  -that is, the interest rate the Fed controls directly.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RewL1qAuXBI/AAAAAAAAAH0/LEb8Ljp-iD8/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+4,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RewL1qAuXBI/AAAAAAAAAH0/LEb8Ljp-iD8/s320/Fed+Independence+4,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The table above seems to indicate that for whatever reason, whenever there is an election with an incumbent from a different party than the Fed Chair, the Fed Funds rate has a tendency to be high.  Similarly, when there is an election with an incumbent from the same party as the Fed chair, the Fed Funds rate is unusually low. </p>
<p>But perhaps these results are due to a few elections in which inflation was high.  After all, the correlation between monthly inflation and the Fed Funds is over 50% for our sample period.  Thus, it is reasonable to assume the Fed will take short term inflation into account when setting the Fed Funds rate.  Table 3 looks at the Fed Funds rate less the one month inflation rate.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RewKLqAuW-I/AAAAAAAAAHc/-kMOdbb_50k/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+4,+Table+3.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RewKLqAuW-I/AAAAAAAAAHc/-kMOdbb_50k/s320/Fed+Independence+4,+Table+3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Hmmm….  It still looks like friends are favored and enemies are hosed.  Well, maybe a one month inflation is an anomaly.  Table 4 looks at the Fed Funds rate less the 3 month inflation rate.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RewJ_KAuW9I/AAAAAAAAAHU/K2nJs9S1PQw/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+4,+Table+4.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RewJ_KAuW9I/AAAAAAAAAHU/K2nJs9S1PQw/s320/Fed+Independence+4,+Table+4.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Marginally less clear-cut, but still, there is a pretty obvious pattern.</p>
<p>So&#8230; one of the following must be the case:<br />1. Somewhere there is a massive mistake in my spreadsheet<br />2. The Fed is trying to benefit incumbents from the same party as the Fed chair and harm incumbents from a different party as the Fed chair<br />3. By shear coincidence, the Fed is acting as if it is trying to benefit incumbents from the same party as the Fed chair and harm incumbents from a different party than the Fed chair, but it has no such intent.</p>
<p>I frankly don&#8217;t find option to be remotely credible. I hope option 1 isn&#8217;t it, but to mitigate that, as always, my spreadsheet is available to anyone who wants it. And one final administrative detail &#8211; I think there may be a few more things to look at here before moving on from this topic. I can think of a few more posts I&#8217;d like to write assuming I can find the data.</p>

                                <p>The Ex-Girlfriend and I were driving home today &#8211; we were on the 14 freeway close to where it merges into the 5 headed into Los Angeles around 3:30 this afternoon.  As we passed one of the onramps, we noted that there was something &#8211; a sofa or something similar &#8211; in the middle of one of the onramps we passed by.  It was large enough and solid enough (at least it looked solid enough) that, had any car hit it, there would have been some serious damage.  Cars on the onramp were going around the thing, whatever it was.  Interestingly enough (to us, at least), one of the cars that went around it was a highway patrol car.</p>
<p>The highway patrol car never stopped, never even slowed down.  Now perhaps it was headed somewhere in a hurry.  Its possible, but it didn&#8217;t have its lights on, and it appeared to us to begin the usual highway patrol car activity (i.e., patrolling for speeders) once it got on the road.  </p>
<p>Both the Ex-Girlfriend and I were surprised it did not stop to clear or at least mark the debris.  I guess the fact that we were surprised is a good thing, and speaks to what we&#8217;ve come to expect from the highway patrol.  It is a pity that some other things we see reasonably often don&#8217;t surprise us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/capitalcommerce/070302/probing_the_mind_of_bushs_econ.htm">James Pethokoukis</a> interviews the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers:<br />
<blockquote>On the trade deficit: The reason for the trade deficit &#8230; is primarily, to my mind, the capital account surplus. It&#8217;s not the trade deficit per se. It&#8217;s that people want to invest in the United States. &#8230; I think of that as a good thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does seem that Pethokoukis left out part of Lazear’s statement so it’s hard to tell what he really said here.  But if this captures the essence of what Lazear said, one has to wonder how got a degree in economics.  The balance of payments identity states that the sum of the current account and the capital account must be zero unless the Central Bank (for the U.S., the Federal Reserve) is engaging in reserve intervention.  In other words, it is true that we have a large capital account surplus that corresponds to the large current account deficit BY DEFINITION.   But what is deriving this result?  That an identity balances cannot answer this question.  My answer has tended to be that we have decided as a nation to save very little so that the degree that we do have investment spending means we have to lean on foreigners to loan us the proceeds.  Now if our investment demand was very high – that might be a good thing.  But investment demand is not that high.  </p>
<p>Our graph shows (gross) investment relative to GDP from 1977 to 2006.  This ratio tends to be cyclical so it is a bit higher now than it was in 2002.  But also notice that the ratio fell after the 1981 tax cut and is now lower than it was in 2000.  Do I blame tax cuts designed to encourage people to consume more that were not accompanied by reductions in government purchases.  Both of these periods of fiscal irresponsibility were accompanied by increases in the current account deficit.  I guess Edward Lazear is not free to criticize the fiscal irresponsibility of his boss or to discussion the reduction in national savings.  So all he is allowed to do is talk about identities as if they can tell us what is cause and effect.</p>

                                <p>I was channel surfing yesterday when the clicker landed on the Belt Ways Boys long enough for me to hear Fred Barnes declare that no one wants to belong to a union.  Not wishing to waste another second listening to a couple of Faux News nutcases lie about everything, I found a decent movie.  <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-op-chait4mar04,0,2476942.column?coll=la-news-comment-opinions">Jonathan Chait</a> does a much better job at discussing the current proposal before Congress:</p>
<blockquote><p>CONGRESS IS debating a measure to change the way workers can form a union. Instead of holding a secret-ballot election, a union could be formed if a majority of employees sign a card indicating they want a union. The House passed the bill Thursday. However, the Senate will probably filibuster it, and if that somehow fails to happen, President Bush will certainly veto it. But it shows, despite conservative bluster about Big Union goons, just how modest the contemporary labor agenda is. The conservative objections to a &#8220;card-check&#8221; plan certainly have some merit. In an ideal world, workers would decide whether to form a union by holding a free secret-ballot election. The workers would be able to listen to arguments from both sides, consider their choice and vote entirely on the merits of the arguments put forward.  The problem is that, in the real world, union elections bear little resemblance to this happy picture. Companies that face organizing drives have an enormous amount of control over the elections. They can hold mandatory meetings and barrage employees with anti-union propaganda. (Employees, obviously, can&#8217;t call a halt to work for a mandatory pro-union propaganda session.) They can predict that a union will result in the shop closing and everybody losing their jobs. And that&#8217;s just the legal part. On top of that, they can do all sorts of illegal things: fire workers involved in organizing, actually threaten to close the shop if a union forms and so on. Enforcement of these violations tends to be spotty and lax. Generally, it takes years for illegal union-busting firms to face any penalties and, even then, whatever fine they pay is often well worth the price of maintaining their bargaining power over the employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can hear conservatives arguing that unions are deviations from perfect competition.  Chait offers a few thoughts on this topic:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the real problem in the American economy is not that workers have too much bargaining power. It&#8217;s that they have too little. Corporate profits have exploded in recent years, while wages for average workers have barely budged. It&#8217;s obviously great that business is doing so well. What we need are a few measures to help divvy up the pie just a bit more evenly. Anything that helps to slow down the massive erosion of unions is one of those sensible, small steps.</p></blockquote>
<p>He doesn’t seem to buy into the perfect competition model of labor markets and neither does <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/03/market_failure_.html">Mark Thoma</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The union question is a hard one for me. I don&#8217;t believe that the degree of market power workers and firms bring to the bargaining table is in balance. &#8220;Superstars&#8221; at the upper end of the income distribution have too much market power, and firms have too much market power at the lower end of the income distribution, where the lower end starts at fairly high levels of income. Unions are one potential answer for workers at the lower end of the income distribution, but is a return to unions the best solution to the market power imbalance? Should we return to the past, or should we try to use the changing political landscape as an opportunity to build better institutions for both workers and firms, institutions that offer workers the same degree of bargaining power that unions provide, and the same degree of income, health, and retirement security, but do so more efficiently? We already know how unions work, pretty much, but can we do better?</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Regular readers may recall I&#8217;ve been looking at money supply and growth rates, and lately I&#8217;ve had a few posts on whether the Fed is attempting to influence elections or not.  Some readers have noted that things I&#8217;ve noted &#8211; increased real M2 per capita around Presidential elections when there is an incumbent from the same party as the Fed chair and decreased real M2 per capita around elections in which there is a Presidential election in which there is an incumbent from a party different than the Fed chair &#8211; could be pure coincidence.  Some have objected that the Fed doesn&#8217;t control money supply directly, etc.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m continuing on.  Last night I did some work looking at interest rates (nominal and real).  Assuming I didn&#8217;t make a mistake (and I want to check my work before I post it, so hopefully it will go up later today or tomorrow) results are interesting.  And its quite possible I will have additional posts on the topic after that.  </p>
<p>But let us say that several weeks go by, and I manage to provide a pretty good proof of my contention.  Let us say, hypothetical, that most people, when they see the evidence, agree that over the past 50 years or so, the Fed has been pretty blatant about interfering in elections.</p>
<p>Then what?  Is it possible to prosecute individual members of the Fed board for something like that? What are the nuts and bolts?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>It seems that <a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=111606C">Jerry Bowyer</a> has found a new home to write his incessant stupidity.  This offering is called <em>Why I Like Deficits</em>:<br />
<blockquote>When strong nations go to war, they borrow money. Weak nations, not so much. That&#8217;s because strong nations usually win, and winning nations usually repay their creditors &#8230; Defense is a sort of infrastructure, too. It provides benefits for future generations, just like roads and bridges do. Is it some kind of rip-off that my kid&#8217;s future tax bills will include interest payments from the war against Jihadists? Not if we win.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the fact that that stupid decision on March 19, 2003 to invade Iraq has turned out to be rather costly in terms of Federal spending.  As long as we crush those nasty Iraqis, our children will somehow benefit?  Bowyer has a very different definition of winning than most of us do.  It would seem to me that this stupid decision has insured that our children will not only have higher tax bills but also more global insecurity because of this “gift from God” for Osama bin Laden (his words).</p>
