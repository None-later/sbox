<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, things are only getting worse. When Speaker Pelosi’s youngest grandchild (born just as the Democrats were taking over Congress) turns ten, Social Security will be taking in less from payroll taxes than will be needed for benefits. Social Security then will turn to its so called “trust fund,” which simply means that Social Security will demand a portion of general tax revenues to supplement payroll taxes. By 2040, when the Speaker’s 33-year-old grandchild will likely be entrenched in the workforce and trying to raise Pelosi’s great-grandchildren, Social Security will require the equivalent of 17 percent of payroll, or taxes nearly 40-percent higher than they are today.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know if Ms. Lukas has children.  If she does, could someone else teach her kids public finance?  Either Ms. Lukas is too stupid to or she is willing to lie – at least to her National Review leaders. Psst kids &#8211; you know that savings account that mommy is keeping for you?  Hire an independent auditor to make sure mommy isn&#8217;t raiding it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Greg Mankiw characterized one part, appropriately in my view, as xenophobic. PGL at AngryBear responded with other parts that were, in his view (and to a lesser extent, mine) appropriately critical of our current macroeconomic policies.  The main problem with Clinton&#8217;s argument is that there is no particular connection between the amount of U.S. debt that China and Japan hold and what happened last week.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with the last sentence and I’ll add an analogy.  When the US stock market crashed in October 1987, some pundits who know nothing about financial economics blamed this on Reagan’s fiscal policy.  Of course, we all knew about Reagan’s fiscal policy for years before the October 1987.  I guess some pundits do not get that changes in market values depends on changes in the perceived fundamentals.  </p>
<p>But I have a question for Andrew, which goes along with my frustration with Greg’s post.  Let me do this by analogy.  I owe a fair amount for my house.  If I decide that I should also run up my credit cards for expensive meals and vacations and purchase a very expensive car, I might start getting letters from my banker asking why my payments are so late.  And this banker has the power to reclaim my car as well as my house if my financial troubles continue.  Is making this observation equivalent to me being xenophobic or somehow racist?  Before anyone answers, consider the fact that I’m a white dude and so is my banker.  So pray tell – where does anyone get from Senator Clinton’s speech that she’s being xenophobic?  We’ve be in the same position had it be the Europeans that purchased all of this U.S. debt.  Right?</p>

But this thing, as terrible as it was alleged to be, was not only never proven, it—the gravamen of the whole dispute—was never even charged. </p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Bennett can tell us, since he&#8217;s so mortified by the criminalization of policitics &#8211; what was alleged in public &#8211; what was the terrible thing that caused the outrage &#8211; when Congress decided to impeach President Clinton?  Was that terrible thing proven in a court of law, or was Clinton never even charged with that terrible thing?</p>

                                <p>Their hypocrisy is on <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=ZDk4ZWM0N2RiZWZkZjE4NzFmMWEyYzM4ODYzMTQ3Mzc=">full display</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush should pardon I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby. The trial that concluded in a guilty verdict on four of five counts conclusively proved only one thing: A White House aide became the target of a politicized prosecution set in motion by bureaucratic infighting and political cowardice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well if there were cowards involved in this: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.  Even the jury thought this was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/06/libby.juror/index.html">Cheney’s doing</a>.  But the spinmeisters at the National Review blame the CIA:</p>
<blockquote><p>From the very beginning of the ensuing spectacle, petty agendas subverted justice. The CIA, at war with the White House, and in particular with the vice president’s office, referred the leak to the Justice Department, even though the agency certainly knew that there had been no criminal violation since Plame wasn’t “covert.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the National Review continues its brazen dishonesty.  And of course, Scooter Libby never lied to anyone:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reasonable people can conclude that it was only Scooter Libby’s imperfect memory—not willful deception &#8211; that gave rise to the charges of lying under oath and obstruction of justice.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Really?</strong>  So this jury was unreasonable?  The National Review proves once again that it thinks that its readers are stupid little children that deserve to be lied to.  But these lies are so incredibly stupid – one has to wonder who they are trying to convince with such utter horse$%^t?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: More BS from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDY1MGY0Mjk1OGVjNmM2YzIxNjdiYjBhZmZiOTM4NmU=">Byron York</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After three and a half years, the CIA-leak case ends with one conviction</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe his hair gets in the way of his ability to count but its was four convictions.  But this is the part where Mr. York flat out lied (again):</p>
<blockquote><p>On virtually every day of the perjury and obstruction of justice trial of Lewis Libby, it was hard not to imagine that the jurors were asking themselves, “Why is this guy on trial?” Why wasn’t Richard Armitage, the former State Department official who first leaked the identity of Valerie Plame Wilson, in the courtroom? Or Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary who told reporters about Mrs. Wilson? Or Karl Rove, the top White House aide who ever-so-briefly discussed her with journalists? As it turns out, that is exactly what jurors were thinking. “There was a tremendous amount of sympathy for Mr. Libby on the jury,” said juror Denis Collins, the only one of the 11 jurors who chose to speak to the press after the verdict. “It was said a number of times, ‘What are we doing with this guy here? Where’s Rove? Where are these other guys?’ I’m not saying we didn’t think Mr. Libby was guilty of the things we found him guilty of. It seemed like he was, as [Libby attorney Ted] Wells put it, he was the fall guy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The “other guys” is not a reference not to Richard Armitage.  It was a reference to Dick Cheney.  But Mr. York can’t say that as his job is to carry the water for these traitors in the White House.  York has lied for the past 3.5 years and his predictions of an acquittal fell flat on his dishonest face.  Oh well – the campaign for the pardon phase of this cover-up begins.</p>

                                <p>We have a housecleaner come by every so often, maybe every two or three weeks.  The Ex-Girlfriend always cleans the apartment before the housekeeper arrives.  I know this behavior isn&#8217;t unique to the Ex-Girlfriend.  Still, it strikes me as odd behavior.  And it isn&#8217;t consistent.  The Ex-Girlfriend is more likely to leave dirty pots and dishes in the sink before the housecleaner shows up.  (I hate leaving things in the sink.)  </p>
<p>And just like Forrest Gump, that&#8217;s all I have to say about that.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17479718">NBC</a> reports on the verdict.  I was going to post a best reaction and the dumbest reaction, but it’s a tie for the latter.  Sharing the award for the dumbest reaction is White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino:<br />
<blockquote>“I would not agree” with any characterization of the verdict as embarrassing for the White House. “I think that any administration that has to go through a prolonged news story that is unpleasant and one that is difficult &#8211; when you’re under the constraints and the policy of not commenting on an ongoing criminal matter &#8211; that can be very frustrating</p></blockquote>
<p>The White House let its minions “comment” on this case, which is to say lie repeatedly.  I’m wondering what Dana Perino meant by “constraints”?  I guess they were constrained from actually telling the truth about TraitorGate – lest Congress demand impeachment of both Dick Cheney and George W. Bush.  But how could not have this award also go to <a href="http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2007/mar/06/fox_news_analysts_libby_verdict_flawed_no_underlyine_crime">Victoria Toensing</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I am totally surprised, because the verdict is inconsistent. That doesn&#8217;t bother the law at all; the courts don&#8217;t care if verdicts are inconsistent, because they say whichever way the jury reached the decision, that&#8217;s up to the jury. But practically, the verdict is inconsistent because if you&#8217;re looking at this, you would either think Scooter Libby had decided to lie to the FBI and the grand jury, or he did not. And it seems to me rather strange that it&#8217;s split. Oh, in the one situation talking to the FBI, he did not, and in the others, he did. It doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Victoria wasn’t really following the trial as she was too busy acting as a minion for the White House.  But Mr. Libby was clearly a busy lad back in 2003 whispering all sorts of things to all sorts of people, which is why Fitzgerald brought five separate charges.  Anyone following this case believed that one of the five was weaker than the others.  And the jury acquitted Mr. Libby on that one particular charge.  I’m sure Ms. Toensing understands that juries do not have to take five separate charges as an all or nothing proposition.</p>
<p>For the best comment so far, I turn the microphone over to <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/blog/?p=91">Speaker Pelosi</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Today’s guilty verdicts are not solely about the acts of one individual. This trial provided a troubling picture of the inner workings of the Bush Administration. The testimony unmistakably revealed – at the highest levels of the Bush Administration – a callous disregard in handling sensitive national security information and a disposition to smear critics of the war in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that Mr. Fitzgerald has ended his investigation, might we suggest that Congress begin theirs?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/03/after_libby.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> edges out Speaker Pelosi for best reaction to the verdict:</p>
<blockquote><p>What it is really about &#8211; what it has always been about &#8211; is whether this administration deliberately misled the American people about WMD intelligence before the war. The risks Cheney took to attack Wilson, the insane over-reaction that otherwise very smart men in this administration engaged in to rebut a relatively trivial issue: all this strongly implies the fact they were terrified that the full details of their pre-war WMD knowledge would come out. Fitzgerald could smell this. He was right to pursue it, and to prove that a brilliant, intelligent, sane man like Libby would risk jail to protect his bosses. What was he really trying to hide? We now need a Congressional investigation to find out more, to subpoena Cheney and, if he won&#8217;t cooperate, consider impeaching him.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree – time to investigate.  And if the White House stonewalls, time to impeach.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The National Review has a bunch of BS on this topic, but I suspect our rightwing troll will demand I note the BS from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODM4MDMxMTgzNzU1YTVkZTliZDUyZmVjN2JmMWI4ODM=">Victoria Toensing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Scooter Libby verdict makes no logical sense, but that won’t bother the legal notions of an appellate court. In convicting on four counts but acquitting of one, the jury made the peculiar decision that Libby lied before the grand jury about his conversation with Time’s Matt Cooper, but not to the FBI when the agents questioned him about the same conversation. Libby gave the same general answer in both fora, specifically that he told Matt Cooper that he did not know if it were true that Joe Wilson’s wife worked for the CIA.</p></blockquote>
<p>She is referring to counts 3 and 5 – forgetting the fact that the jury found Libby guilty of counts 1, 2, and 4 as well.</p>

                                <p>When we noted the debate as to funding for <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/veteran-medical-care-how-much-has.html">veteran medical care</a>, we should have noted this from <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://krugman.page.nytimes.com/b/a/258176.htm">Paul Krugman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s important to understand these numbers, in order to react to the inevitable right-wing attempt to spin the Walter Reed scandal: predictably, they’re claiming that the problems at Walter Reed show the evils of “socialized medicine.” Um, no: they show what happens when a government that doesn’t care starves veterans’ health care of resources even as its war places huge new demands on the system, and then makes things even worse through cronyism and privatization.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does seem that Nobel-Prize winner Dr. <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/006985.htm">Michelle Malkin</a> blames socialized medicine and offers this solution:</p>
<blockquote><p>Will the Bush-bashers join with free-market critics to effect real change and help the troops who need and deserve better care?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/03/05/malkin-walter-reed-was-privatized">John Amato</a> argues that Walter Reed was already on the path to privatization.  Since neither John nor Michelle are economists, let’s turn the microphone over to <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002900.html">Max Sawicky</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In practice anything is subject to privatization and can be done well, or badly, either privatized or not. The problem lies more in whether privatization is carried out to save money &#8211; that&#8217;s usually the justification &#8211; and in the attitude of public sector overseers.  For services that are hard to monitor, relatively speaking, private firms save money by reducing labor costs, which means less labor or labor of reduced qualifications (and cost). If the public sector lacks the inclination or resources to monitor contracts, you are going to get problems. When Republicans privatize, they are susceptible to the delusion that the service will deliver itself, so oversight is lacking. They are also reluctant to nourish the &#8220;acquisitions workforce&#8221; &#8211; Federal managers who make and monitor contracts.</p></blockquote>
<p>All that’s left to add is that when one tries to run an invasion on the cheap, bad things are likely to happen.</p>

                                <p>Over the past few days I’ve had a few posts looking at whether the Fed acts to improperly influence elections.  Last night, that included <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and_9610.html">this post looking at real M2 per capita and changes in real GDP per capita</a>.  So far, a pattern has been developing in these posts…  factors the Fed has some control over (real M2 per capita, the Fed Funds rate) seem to always loosen up when an incumbent is running for office if that incumbent is from the same party as the Fed.  These same factors tend to tighten up when an incumbent is running for office if that incumbent is from a different party from the Fed.  Additionally, the pattern observed does not seem to be in reaction to changes in the economy, at least as measured by real GDP per capita.  In fact, movements in real GDP per capita around these elections seem to reflect changes in the real M2 per capita (or fed funds rate).</p>
<p>Today’s post is not where I intended to go next.  (I’m hoping to have a look at the ten year rate next.  I expect it to behave a bit differently – the Fed has less control over that, after all so the pattern I’m expecting is different.)  But in response to reader dilbert dogbert’s question, the table below shows the real M1 per capita in the various months through the year.  As with the other graphs, I have color coded the fastest growing and slowing growing months in each category, and as before, there is a solid column of orange (least favorable to growth) and a solid column of green (most favorable to growth), and the columns are precisely where they are in the other series.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Re1r3IzH87I/AAAAAAAAAIM/V-dijmMqhSM/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+6,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Re1r3IzH87I/AAAAAAAAAIM/V-dijmMqhSM/s320/Fed+Independence+6,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The interesting thing for me is that M1 tends to be negative throughout the sample, except in years in which a “friendly” incumbent is running for re-election.  Society has been using less cash per person, once you adjust for inflation, since 1959 (when the sample begins).  The use of other instruments – credit cards, for instance, seems to be making cash less important… except right before a friendly incumbent is running for re-election.</p>
<p>One more interesting thing… columns 1 and 2 might be negative, just like column 3.  But notice the difference in magnitude of the numbers.  This is not something that is attributable to randomness.  And as we’ve already seen before, its not attributable to the Fed reacting to the economy either.  So what else is there?  At some point, we move beyond the realm of coincidence.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Over the past few days I’ve had a few posts looking at whether the Fed acts to improperly influence elections.  For example, the following chart, </p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and_05.html">reproduced from an earlier post</a> shows that the increase in real M2 per capita every month is higher in years in which a Presidential incumbent from the same party as the Fed chair runs for re-election than in other years.  By contrast, when an incumbent is running for re-election but he is from a different party than the Fed chair, the growth in real M2 per capita is not only lower every month than in other years, it is also negative.  </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rey8HozH86I/AAAAAAAAAIE/Em-Z017U5G4/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+4,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rey8HozH86I/AAAAAAAAAIE/Em-Z017U5G4/s320/Fed+Independence+4,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I’ve also produced tables (see the same link as above) showing that the fed funds rate, which the Federal Reserve controls directly, has similar very clear-cut behavior:  when a “friend” is running for re-election, the fed funds rate is unusually low, and when an “enemy” is running for re-election, the fed funds rate is unusually high.  </p>
<p>A cynic might conclude from this that the Fed helps its friends by making money cheap and easy to benefit its friends, yet tight and expensive to hurt its enemies.  </p>
<p>Now, some readers have objected.  They point out this can be coincidence.  The Fed may well be reacting properly to conditions in the economy.  Let us consider that argument in more detail.  If the Fed is behaving impartially, to get the clear-cut results we see in real M2 per capita and fed funds rate, the Fed needs a reason to slow down the economy when an incumbent from the other party is running for office, and it needs a reason to try to jump start the economy.  </p>
<p>Put another way, for this to be a coincidence, for the Fed to be operating properly, when an “enemy” is running for re-election, the economy has to be growing quickly, and when a “friend” is running for re-election, the economy has to be faltering.  (Take another look at the table above – the table doesn’t exactly brook a middle ground.)  </p>
<p>On the other hand, a cynic such as myself would disagree.  The cynic would say – the loose money supply in the last column… that will cause rapid growth.  Similarly, the tight money supply in the second to last column… that will cause growth to slow.</p>
<p>This makes for a testable hypothesis, H0: Fed acting properly v. H1: Fed acting improperly.  So… what does happen with growth?  The table below shows the growth rate in real GDP per capita per quarter.  (Unfortunately, the data is not available monthly).</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rey8AozH85I/AAAAAAAAAH8/SNBHhpkmBIY/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+5,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rey8AozH85I/AAAAAAAAAH8/SNBHhpkmBIY/s320/Fed+Independence+5,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>What do we see?  Well, in the three quarters leading up to an election, real growth per capita is fastest precisely when the Fed’s friends can use the help.  And in two of the three quarters leading up to an election, growth is slowest precisely when the Fed’s enemies can use the extra weight dragging them back.  In the quarter, growth is almost at its slowest, missing by a mere 0.02%!</p>
<p>Note also… when growth is fastest in column 4, it is usually quite a bit faster than in other columns – there is little room for confusion on the Fed’s part, and simply insisting that the Fed was working with preliminary data seems a stretch.  </p>
<p>What about in the quarter in which the election takes place?  What explains that?  Well… elections take place about a third the way through that quarter.  Thus, the Fed has the time to reverse course.  In fact, after at least a year of improperly tight money, it has to loosen up to prevent a recession, and after at least a year of improperly loose money, it has to tighten up to prevent runaway inflation.  </p>
<p>Sure, the data is limited, but when the same results are obtained several ways, appealing to coincidence gets less and less likely.  I’ll be honest, I managed to convince myself last week.  But if any of you still need convincing, in the next day or two, I’ll look at the coincidence question again, from a different direction, this one involving both cause and effect of Fed behavior.  </p>
