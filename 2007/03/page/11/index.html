                                <p>Reader T-Bone sends along something he posted on a gaming-clan forum (go figure!) forum.  (I took the liberty of editing it slightly.) </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>I believe supply-side economic policies that we have now are not effective in increasing growth or potential growth. It doesn&#8217;t work as advertised. Bush&#8217;s tax cuts for the wealthiest people was maybe the worst policy we could have.  Some have suggested they would like to see the cuts geared more towards the middle class. But I would go further. I think we&#8217;re probably could do better, long-term growth-wise with some level of higher taxes for the richest. BTW, I&#8217;ll use the words rich/poor for simplicity and lack of a better word&#8230;</p>
<p>1a. Basics<br />Look at how it works. If you cut taxes for the largest incomes, you give the richest more money. They invest (save) a much larger portion of the additional money than the lower classes would with the same total amount of money. Lower income people would spend a larger percentage, saving less than the rich do. Also, some of their savings (investment) would be like the same investment as the rich, while some would be to pay off debt, which is freeing up some investment for the rich (so would be essentially the same as the rich having more to invest).</p>
<p>1b. Basic summary<br />So with tax cuts to the rich, you get more investment, some demand.<br />With tax cuts to the poor, you get more spending (demand), some investment in their hands, and some investment put into the hands of the rich (when they pay off debt).</p>
<p>2.a Supply-side basic<br />Now the idea behind supply side economics is that more investment money will lead to more long-term investments (ability to create better products, or more efficient products, or to increase output).</p>
<p>2.b Futility of supply-side<br />However, there is not exactly a lack of investment. If there is something to be invested into, then whether it will get the investment depends on some things. First is the expected rate of return, considering risk and alternative investments (opportunity cost). High risk investments with only a promise of small rewards if successful won&#8217;t get much investment. The best investments get the first money.</p>
<p>2.c Effects of increasing investment (assuming no change in demand)<br />When you increase the amount of investment money, more of the investments with lower rates-of-return get investment money. Investors are more-or-less spreading investments around equally to the best investment. For example as one stock gets bought and pushes up the price, the return on that stock decreases compared to the price paid for that stock (that why your mutual funds can be value/equity focused, expecting a stock is undervalued and will rise in price with more investment, or your mutual fund can be growth focused, expecting a company will grow and increase profits, increasing the value that way). But also anything that will grow in value is an investment, including homes. With an increase in the investment money, as other investments become more saturated, homes as an asset become a better investment, increasing their value. Investments are not just in the USA either. More investment money in American hands also increases the investment in stocks abroad, as well as other investments abroad. Wherever the best return is, that&#8217;s where the money goes.</p>
<p>2.d Summed up idea behind supply-side.<br />So that&#8217;s where the supply side comes in. You give more money for investment, and so people are looking for more places to put it. Investment is cheaper/easier to come by.</p>
<p>3.a Demand is real driver<br />But in my opinion, the demand side is much more important. What makes an investment give a higher rate of return (and thus get investment money more readily) is demand. In fact, low demand can actually cause a loss on investment (nobody wants to invest in that and would rather hold the money).</p>
<p>3.b Economies of scale (efficency)<br />More demand also allows more economy-of-scale efficiency increases, which is that the cost per-person of providing a product or service decreases as you serve more and more people. This increases the profits, which can be reinvested or distributed as pay or to stockholders.</p>
<p>3.c Quality of spending (also regarding efficiency)<br />I would also argue there is a difference in the quality of GDP or quality of spending that comes from the rich versus the poor. Lower income people spend the money on &#8220;better quality&#8221; or &#8220;more efficiently produced&#8221; goods/services than the wealthy. I mean, the satellite radio companies (XM and Sirius now merging) will do better with money in the hands of lower incomes than on higher incomes because they need lots of customers, not a few rich customers. There is great economy of scale in that type of business, as well as many more technology related businesses. The only cost of adding a new customer is the cost of creating their satellite radio for them to use. They don&#8217;t need to add new programming to accomodate the new customer, etc.. But when a rich person exhausts their collection of efficient goods and services, they start using money for inefficient things, things that give little value for a lot of cost (or a high GDP contribution but little real value). One good example in mind is a guy who had a custom luxury car built for just himself for a couple million (or was is 10+ million?), and took like 15 people working for some decent amount of time to create it. There no efficiency gained by building that car. It&#8217;s not produced on an assembly line and there&#8217;s no incentive from it to improve the efficiency of the assembly line. Imagine what those 15 workers could have created in that time for average people. That was an extreme example, but the same applies for other jobs being done that quite unnecessary. Hiring a full time crew to take care of a your mansion, of which 3 rooms are ever used, etc.</p>
<p>3.d Increasing Capacity<br />When talking about production capacity, a company isn&#8217;t going to expand unless demand warrants it. If for some reason there is no investment to be had (is that possible?) or if the investment is too expensive to obtain compared to the added return on expanding, then the shortage of product could allow prices to be raised in order to accumulate the investment needed simply from profit. If there isn&#8217;t increased demand, then any additional investment is useless.</p>
<p>3.e Improving processes<br />When improving processes (improving production efficiency) the costs are weighed against the savings. Again, if there is no money on hand, the money needs to come from outside investment. The cost of the outside investment is weighed against savings gained from the improved processes. But adding a ton of money to the global pool of available investment only lowers the costs of investment marginally, compared to the gain a business gets from higher profits (internal investment money) and a bigger return on the improvement because of the larger demand.</p>
<p>3.f R&#038;D<br />When investing in R&#038;D the same is true, but instead of improved processes, you have improved product.</p>
<p>3.g New Business (demand vs investment)<br />When talking about investing in new business, again demand is the driving factor. More demand makes new business a better investment.</p>
<p>3.h New Business (motivation to use investment)<br />I would also argue that each dollar being saved by a lower income person is more likely to be used for new business than each dollar being saved by a rich person. A rich person who already has such large income will have less motivation to venture into something new in addition to whatever is currently earning them a large income. Spread that amount of investment into the hands of lower income individuals, and they have more motivation and dedication to improving their status by starting something.</p>
<p>4. Paying for tax breaks (or increased spending)<br />When you give a tax break, you also need a way to pay for it. You could cut spending, or raise taxes elsewhere. You could also pay for it with borrowing (debt). It does no good to borrow from US citizens, since you just take their investment money. So in the overall scheme of things, you need to get foreign loans to actually increase investment. Likewise, any debt incurred by a lower class citizen is actually investment money being used by someone else (the money loaned is no longer available for investment).</p>
<p>5. Bush 43<br />The current Bush has lowered taxes, increased debt, increased some spending while cutting other spending. I believe some of the spending cuts were funding to programs where the state and local (or the individual taxpayers) had to pick up the slack. This meant raising taxes or adjusting funding at the state and local levels, or causing people to have to pay more for something that was covered by the gov. So cutting taxes at the federal level to force tax increases at the local and state levels or causing higher expenses on the individual level aren&#8217;t exactly tax cuts, but tax shifting.</p>
<p>6. Quick conclusion.<br />Anyway, main point was that supply-side economics slows us down more than it helps. If you want to maximize growth, we are currently at a point where our best growth would come from more tax on the richest to pay for either debt-reduction, gov spending, or tax cut targeted at the lower incomes.</p>

<blockquote>But the cliche of the Irish pub filled with Guinness drinkers is giving way to a different picture as new wealth, new opportunities and immigration transform tastes and drinking habits in one of Europe&#8217;s fastest growing economies. Alongside the decline of Guinness is an increasing appetite for wine, spirits, cider and imported beer &#8230; Latest figures from global drinks giant Diageo, which owns Guinness, show local sales for the brand down about 7 percent in the six months to the end of December 2006 from a year before. Wine now accounts for over a fifth of alcohol drunk in Ireland &#8230; But the decline of Guinness is by no means global.  Sales are doing well in North America and parts of West Africa &#8211; where the stronger, bottled local version of Guinness has a reputation, perhaps undeserved, for everything from helping prevent malaria to enhancing male sexual prowess. But while &#8220;Irish pubs&#8221; have become a fixture across the globe, many in Ireland have been struggling. Guinness reckons Irish pubs are opening abroad at the rate of about one a day &#8211; the same rate as rural pubs are closing back home.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the Irish are enjoying more French wine while Americans are enjoying more stout beer from Ireland.  This all sounds like the benefits of free trade to me.  If Diageo is selling more outside of Ireland but less in Ireland, why would <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmYxYTc4MzYxMDhkYWYwYzFjNWJiNTBmMWEyNTNjMGQ=">KLo</a> suggesting that this is the end of Guinness?  Of course, one could always turn to the latest Annual Report for Diageo.  In fact, we see the following statement from their 2006 Annual Report:<br />
<blockquote>Guinness volume declined 3% although pricing offset weak volumes and net sales, after deducting excise duties, were flat year on year.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, nominal sales are flat but not declining rapidly.  While this is not great news, it does not signal the end of this brand.  I guess the folks at the National Review do not realize that Annual Reports exist.</p>

<blockquote>Lucas writes that the promised benefits under the current system cannot be met with only the revenues that are brought in through the payroll tax. By 2030, Social Security obligations will consume 17 percent of payroll, compared to 11 percent today.

We’ve gone over these two issues repeatedly.  There is a Social Security Trust Fund reserve that the National Review simply ignores.  And privatization does not create funds out of thin air.  Assuming that the folks at the National Review are not complete idiots (one has to wonder) – do they think repeating their lies ad nausam will make them true?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/washington/14attorneys.html">Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Jeff Zeleny</a> have a nice run down on how President Bush wants to insulate himself from the prosecutor firing scandal.  AG Gonzales takes “responsibility” but not blame.  It was all D. Kyle Sampson’s fault.  It is absurd to believe that Sampson did this by himself.  So I believe Gonzales must resign.   But as we see from this story, now the blame is being put on Harriet Miers who was not part of the Justice Department as she was White House Counsel.  </p>
<p>And of course, Dan Bartlett offers us this lie:<br />
<blockquote>With Mr. Bush traveling in Mexico, the White House insisted that the president’s role had been minimal and laid the blame primarily on Harriet E. Miers, who was White House counsel when the prosecutors lost their jobs and who stepped down in January. “The White House did not play a specific role in the list of the seven U.S. attorneys,” said Dan Bartlett, Mr. Bush’s counselor, referring to a Justice Department roster of those to be dismissed. But he said the White House, through Ms. Miers’s office, ultimately “signed off on the list.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Further down in the story, it seems the real concern to this White House is whether this scandal will damage Bush himself.  The probability that AG Gonzales will be forced out of office looks pretty high to me.  That’s what one gets when one does Bush’s bidding.  When trouble brews, it’s time to throw another pawn under the bus.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://tbogg.blogspot.com/2007/03/buh-bye-berto-reviews-are-in.html">Tbogg</a> is placing a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/markets-in-everything-betting-on-white.html">bet</a> on the day we’ll see the AG resign.<br />
<blockquote>If they&#8217;ve lost Cornyn, &#8216;Berto is a goner. I&#8217;m guessing Friday afternoon&#8230; late in the day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good luck Tbogg!</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTQxZjQ0YjQ1OGRiMjg0OWQ2MzMzZTE2MTQyMTUwNmQ=">Andy McCarthy</a> argues:<br />
<blockquote>Now, no matter what you think of Gonzales&#8217;s performance, it would be a travesty to allow him to be forced out because the opposition has turned the USAtty fiasco into a referendum on abuse of presidential power.  As there has been absolutely no abuse, they shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to win &#8211; which makes it all the more infuriating that Gonzales, if it would make the problem go away, seems only too eager to surrender an important executive prerogative, namely, the authority of the president, rather than the court, to appoint interim U.S. attorneys pending senate confirmation. </p></blockquote>
<p>No abuse of power?  Is McCarthy spinning or just utterly clueless?</p>

                                <p>I’m sad to see <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/13/AR2007031301763.html">Senator Kent Conrad</a> endorses fiscal irresponsibility:<br />
<blockquote>Senate Democrats unveiled a spending blueprint yesterday that envisions a massive expansion of the nation&#8217;s health-insurance program for children, as well as billions of additional dollars for other domestic priorities such as public education, veterans&#8217; health care and local police. Despite the additional spending, Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said the proposal would virtually erase the federal deficit within four years without raising taxes and produce a surplus of $132 billion by 2012.  Under that scenario, Conrad said, Congress could extend President Bush&#8217;s signature tax cuts past their 2010 expiration date and halt the expansion of the alternative minimum tax, but only if sufficient revenue is raised elsewhere to cover the cost of about $800 billion over five years. &#8220;We believe some of the tax cuts will be extended. Perhaps all of them will be,&#8221; Conrad said during a late-afternoon briefing for reporters at his Capitol Hill office. &#8220;You can extend any or all of them, if you pay for them.&#8221; Conrad was vague on the details of how that might be accomplished. Possible sources for the extra cash, he said, include improving taxpayer compliance, eliminating offshore tax havens and conducting a top-to-bottom overhaul of the tax system.  The briefing yesterday, billed as a preview of a budget document that is to be released today to the Senate Budget Committee, marks the beginning of a months-long attempt by the new Democratic majority to craft an alternative to Bush&#8217;s spending plan for the budget year that begins in October. It also marks another step to restore discipline to the congressional budget process, which has faltered badly over the past decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the Senator wants to restore fiscal discipline, he pretends we can extend these tax “cuts” (read deferrals) and have more government spending.  How is that possible?  The answer may lie in who wrote this WaPo article – Lori Montgomery.  I suspect the Senator is talking about the unified surplus (deficit) which includes the increasing Social Security surplus.  Of course, Lori Montgomery might ask “what Social Security surplus”?  But I would like to see the Senator’s proposal scored in terms of the General Fund DEFICIT.  Our friend <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/03/more_budget_confusion_from_the.html#015865">Dean Baker</a> would want us to cast these figures in terms of percent of GDP.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: My thanks to AB reader CoRev for letting us know that the <a href="http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2007/03/balanced_budget.html">Skeptical Optimist</a> is still doing his silly trend line forecasts:<br />
<blockquote>Balanced budget trend: still June 2008 &#8230; one of the quickest ways to slow down or halt the growth of tax receipts would be the prospect of a tax rate hike. <br />Assuming nominal tax revenues and nominal spending continue to grow at the rates indicated by his trend lines, then the Social Security surplus will match the deficit in the rest of the Federal budget.  Of course, there is no reason to believe the assumption that nominal tax revenues and nominal spending continue to grow at the rates indicated by his trend lines.  After all, the temperatures in LA today will be about 10 degrees cooler than yesterday.  If this trend continues, I’ll have to go buy a heavy winter coat for the weekend.</p></blockquote>
<p>And of course, Skeptical Optimist is about as dumb as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/was-2003-tax-cut-responsible-for-recent.html">Lawrence Kudlow</a> when it comes to the effect of tax rates on economic growth.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This blog has some smart readers.  Sure, many of you are not economists, but nobody is perfect.  Many of you, whether or economists or not, have something to say that is interesting to say about the economy or economic issues.  In many cases, its just a question or series of questions, in other cases, it’s the answer to a question.  </p>
<p>Over the past few months, I have encouraged readers to write guest blogs, and I’ve posted these guest blogs.  I hope the practice continues.  But I’d also like to encourage those of you who wish to become more regular contributors to follow your dream of becoming, well, a regular contributor here at Angry Bear.  And (suggestion courtesy of reader Movie Guy) I’d like to ask for volunteers for something else.  Regular readers know PGL always has something to say about the BLS unemployment report release.  Perhaps you are interested in inflation, or money supply, or something else for which there is a regular release.  Why not be the “Angry Bear designated writer” on that topic?  Whenever a report comes out, link to it and write up a brief post.  Tell us whether the number was expected, and what it means.  </p>
<p>Sure, blogging takes time.  But I can say from experience, it’s a lot of fun, and you learn a lot in the process.  And if you decide to write a weekly post, or a bi-weekly post, it isn’t a big time commitment, but you’ll be helping the blog grow.  And you’ll have the opportunity to flesh out your ideas and guide the discussion.</p>
<p>As to content – just look to recent guest posts.  A very wide variety of topics have been covered.  As to attitude &#8211; Angry Bear has designated the blog “left of center.”  But some of the guest posts have been written by decidedly right of center readers.  There is no reason why we can’t have a right of center regular either.</p>
<p>Please e-mail me if you’re interested in helping make Angry Bear all that it can be.  (Note – I’ll be out until Thursday, so you might not get a response from me until then.)</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>OK.  If you’ve been awake in the past six years, you know the first three years of the GW term were pretty awful.  You also know the second three years were adequate.  (For a look at GW’s performance, and that of other Presidents, see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and_05.html">here</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I haven’t run any numbers, and I’ve been swamped lately, but I would guess that the next couple of years of the GW administration will show, at best, adequate growth.  I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s some major tanking in the economy within the next two years either.  Like the other Republican Presidents since Ike, he will underperform every Democrat in the post –WW2 era when it comes to the annualized increase in real growth less increase in debt per capita.  He’ll probably underperform even if debt is left out.  He’ll probably even underpeform if you leave out the “per capita” and fail to adjust for inflation.</p>
<p>So now the question… what happens after that?  What will be the position of all those who are crowing these days about how tax cuts work, and pointing to GW’s adequate three years as evidence?  (These people all ignore the fact that GW’s tax cutting started in his first year in office.  In 2001, he cut the lowest marginal rate from 15% to 10%, and the top rate was also cut by half a percentage point.  The top rate was cut by another half a percentage point in 2002.)  </p>
<p>I see a few options.  They could insist his performance was just dandy, facts be damned – call that the St. Ronald the Reagan scenario.  That basically involves pretending that one’s mostest favoritest wonderfulest president just managed to beat out the performance of history’s greatest monster, and that only by driving up the debt.  </p>
<p>Another option is to insist that it’s Clinton’s fault.  A third option is to insist that somehow one of the other actions that GW took somehow nullified the magical properties of the tax cuts.  (I.e., “he spends like a democrat!”)  A fourth option is to admit they’re wrong, they’ve been wrong, and they’ve led the country down a ruinous path.  </p>
<p>I could be wrong… who knows, GW might produce the bestest most Reaganish economy ever in the next two years.  Time will tell.  But what if I’m right?  What option are the believers going to take?  (Its pretty option they aren’t going to take.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Another impressive jobs report was released by the U.S. Department of Labor last Friday, but you didn’t hear anything about it from the big-three Republican candidates for president. They claim to support President Bush’s supply-side tax cuts, and say they will fight repeal should they be elected to the Oval Office. Yet neither Sen. McCain, nor former-Gov. Romney, nor former-Mayor Giuliani talks about the continued economic benefits of the sweeping tax cuts of 2003 &#8230; Just look at the evidence. Wall Street economist Michael Darda points out that real wages from increased job creation have climbed at twice the speed during this business cycle than in the first 66 months of the previous cycle. Boosted by service-sector job creation, nonfarm payrolls grew by 97,000 in February, with a net upward revision of 55,000 for the December and January reports. The median length, or duration, of unemployment fell 8 percentage points in the last year, while non-management wages increased 4.1 percent, almost twice the inflation rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s definitely look at the evidence – starting with last month’s news on employment.  An increase of only 97,000 is weak employment growth.  But why is Kudlow presenting the payroll survey when he has argued that the household survey is the better measure?  Could it be that employment per the household survey fell?  Yes – the unemployment rate fell but that’s because the labor force participation rate fell.  And don’t you love the fact that Kudlow is talking increases in the nominal value of “non-management wages”?  In real terms, wages are only 0.5% higher than they were in July 2003.  This is not the massive increase in real wages that Michael Darda and the man in the clown suit want to portray.</p>
<p>Conservative economist <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/03/more-laffer-curve-laughers.html">Andrew Samwick</a> must pay more attention to what Kudlow’s colleague &#8211; Ramesh Ponnuru – has been doing than Kudlow as Senator McCain has bought into the free lunch supply-side nonsense that Kudlow is peddling.  Andrew passes along a couple of questions from conservative economist <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/03/mccain-on-laffer-curve.html">Greg Mankiw</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. If you think the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts increased revenue, why did you vote against them?</p>
<p>2. If you think tax cuts increase revenue, why advocate spending restraint? Can&#8217;t we pay for new spending programs with more tax cuts?</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrew has a few questions of his own:</p>
<blockquote><p>As Greg has announced that he&#8217;s an economic advisor to Governor Romney, I&#8217;ll be very curious to hear Romney&#8217;s response to a direct question about the circumstances under which he would be willing to increase taxes if he&#8217;s elected President.  The question that I would like to have answered by any policy maker who voted for the tax cuts and believes that they have increased revenues is: Why did you make them so small?</p></blockquote>
