                                <p>In the middle of the usual supply-side spin, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzUzMzA0N2UxM2E0MTg4Mzk5YmI1Zjk3YzU4ZGVlZmE=">Chris Edwards</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s become fashionable to argue that increased government spending on education is the key to success for countries like Ireland. I’m skeptical.</p></blockquote>
<p>Has Mr. Edwards ever been to Dublin?  When he decides to actually visit the country that he chooses to use as evidence for his supply-side spin, might I suggest he visit Trinity College and the University of Dublin?  Edwards also refers to the Ireland of twenty years ago as a “backwater”.  How insulting!</p>
<p>But let’s take a look at his argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ireland has boomed in recent years, and it now boasts the fourth-highest gross domestic product per capita in the world. In the mid-1980s, Ireland was a backwater with an average income level 30 percent below that of the European Union. Today, Irish incomes are 40 percent above the EU average. Was this dramatic change the luck of the Irish? Not at all. It resulted from a series of hard-headed decisions that shifted Ireland from big government stagnation to free market growth. After years of high inflation, double-digit unemployment rates, and soaring government debt that topped 100 percent of GDP, Irish policymakers began to cut spending in the late 1980s in a desperate bid to recover financial stability.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll give him that the Republic of Ireland did move to fiscal restraint – which of course is the opposite of the Bush fiscal train wreck that the National Review cheerleads for.  Edwards, however, would have you believe that Ireland has low tax rates:</p>
<blockquote><p>Low business tax rates have helped Ireland attract huge inflows of foreign investment. Given the country’s modest size, it boosts a high-tech industry second to none. Intel, Dell, and Microsoft are among the island’s biggest exporters. Ireland also hosts booming insurance, banking, money management, and pharmaceutical industries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where to begin?  Even though Kash has started his own blog, he left <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/irelands-corporate-taxation.html">this gem </a> back in late 2005:</p>
<blockquote><p>So Ireland enjoys a decided benefit from its low corporate income tax rates. But note that this benefit is a very different one from the typical supply-side argument in favor of low taxes, which is that low taxes promote growth by promoting capital investment and thus generating economic growth. There certainly was a lot of capital investment in Ireland during the 1990s. But much of the gains to Ireland from its low tax rates were simply due to profit transference from the US to Ireland by US multinational corporations. As I&#8217;ve argued before, the link between economic growth and tax rates has yet to be established.</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier, Kash had provided <a href="http://%20angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/capital-taxation-and-growth.html">this evidence</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ireland has indeed been the fastest growing economy in the OECD (that&#8217;s the club of the world&#8217;s richest countries). But it has HIGH taxes on capital, not low ones. At the other end of the spectrum is Italy, with the lowest economic growth in the OECD. Yet Italy has extremely LOW tax rates on capital income.</p></blockquote>
<p>I also have had several posts on Ireland’s economic growth with a good summary with links to some very good papers (often by economists at Trinity College and the University of Dublin) provided <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/irish-economic-miracle-and-tax-policy.html">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Irish economic miracle was in part an employment boom as it had laid the foundation for a productivity boom many years earlier. This employment boom piggybacked the U.S. technology boom with U.S. multinationals realizing that Ireland not only was a gateway into the European Union that could avoid customs duties but also a means for reducing its effective tax rate by using transfer pricing manipulation to shift U.S. income into tax-advantaged Ireland. The really odd thing about the tax cut jihadists in the U.S. is that they are now complaining that the IRS might actually enforce section 482 of the U.S. tax code. Their hypocrisy is apparent when they claim – as many have been recently doing – that enforcing section 482 will lead to an outsourcing of jobs to low-tax jurisdictions. The Irish know that the lack of enforcement of section 482 has been part of their success in attracting jobs from U.S. multinationals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Edwards says he’ll spend St. Patrick’s Day in a pub.  Might I suggest he spend the day in a library catching up on the real economics literature on Ireland’s economic growth?</p>

<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/03/krugman_vs_barr.html#more">Mark Thoma</a> reminds us of the November 1, 2004 <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/economy/CharlieRose110104.html">Charlie Rose Show</a> where Paul Krugman debated Robert Barro.  While it was an interesting debate – this portion of Barro’s comments reminded me of what we often see over at the National Review:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because I think where we are now, which is actually quite a good economy &#8211; owes quite a bit to the 2003 tax cut plan. And I &#8211; I should distinguish a lot between the 2003 and 2001 tax cut plans. They are really quite different. The big thing about the 2003 plan is that it didn&#8217;t just heap money to people. It didn&#8217;t just particularly give money to people at increased incentives to do things. It did that particularly by accelerating the marginal income tax rate cuts. It did it by cutting some of the tax rates that pertain to saving. It motivated people to work more, to enhance productivity, to increase investment. It worked great. I mean, since early 2003, the economy has done extremely well. And I &#8211; I can&#8217;t prove it for sure, but I think it is a very convincing case that that tax cut in 2003 was a lot responsible for it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good grief!  Even before the 2003 tax cut was passed, economists such as Paul Krugman were suggesting that we would enjoy a return to full employment as the great investment slump would eventually reverse itself.  The Federal Reserve had reduced the Federal Funds from around 6.5% in late 2000 to around 1% by 2003.  A year later, the Federal Reserve would reverse its easy money policy as aggregate demand began to increase.  Barro just ignores these Keynesian considerations and pretends its all some sort of supply-side phenomena.  But as Barro often tells his students, Keynesian recessions tend to reverse themselves on their own without assistance from fiscal policy.  On the eve of the 2004 elections, however, he makes out like he is Lawrence Kudlow.  Sad.</p>

                                <p>I was reading some of the comments from a post earlier in the week and I have a question.  It may seem unserious, but it isn&#8217;t.  How do we know that the price system is the best allocator of goods and services in a world in which most of the assumptions of the perfect competition model don&#8217;t hold?  Is it just that the US works better than North Korea and the old USSR?  But does it work as well as most Scandinavian countries?  Does it work as well as it used to in the early 1960s when the highest marginal tax rates were so much higher than now and the government&#8217;s role inthe economy was so much bigger?  And if not, what does that say?  And the fact that it works better than places that are pretty anarchic, such as Somalia &#8211; does that say something too?</p>
<p>How would we test a statement like &#8220;the price system is the best allocator of goods and services?&#8221;</p>

                                <p><a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/03/center-for-responsible-federal-budget.html">Andrew Samwick</a> reports on the annual conference of the <a href="http://www.crfb.org/">Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget</a>.  I can see why they invited him:</p>
<blockquote><p>the government budget should be in balance over the course of business cycle, where budget here refers to the General Fund, excluding surpluses or deficits in entitlement programs. As an alternative, I would accept a weaker standard that there be no trend in the ratio of total federal debt to GDP. (This debt figure includes any debt held by government trust funds.) Second, all entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare should be sustainably solvent using enumerated and dedicated revenue sources &#8230; Enumerated and dedicated revenue sources means that the practice of relying on the General Fund to finance upwards of 75 percent of Medicare Part B and D should end &#8211; no open-ended commitments. Enumerate a revenue source to pay for it. Personally, I won&#8217;t work actively for the election of any political candidate or the in the administration of any politician who espouses a budget policy at odds with these targets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrew criticizes the current administration’s fiscal record in general and with this specific complaint:</p>
<blockquote><p>If concern over tax burdens on future generations is what motivates you, then it is completely inconsistent with that motivation to pass a Medicare prescription drug bill that generates a projected unfunded obligation that is bigger than the projected unfunded obligation in Social Security. It is also completely inconsistent with that motivation to run General Fund deficits that are not balanced by later surpluses, raising the debt burden on future generations. This sort of inconsistency will doom any chance at prudent reform of any of the programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>He continues noting his concern that the Social Security debate is being framed in terms of a class conflict.  Indeed it is – especially for those who ignore his call to think in terms of balancing the General Fund over the long-run.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader Bruce Webb mentions the one thing that sort of bothered me with Andrew’s post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why Medicare Part B and D should require any dedicated revenue source beyond what is required for any other government program is simply assumed here. Yes we are taking a portion of your income and using it to pay for health care for the elderly. Yes we are taking a portion of your income and using it to buy aircraft carriers. As a nation we have accepted the notion that we need to fund public roads, and public libraries, and airports, and law courts. Yet Samwick insists on walling off public health.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair, we should contrast what Andrew writes to what President Bush has done.  Bush decided to increase public funding of health care (as in that prescription drug benefit) as he reduces income taxes.  And this hack we have to call President often brags about both fiscally irresponsible moves in the same speech.  After all – the modern Republican Party thinks money grows on trees.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<blockquote> Just a Matter of pH</p></blockquote>
<p>Global warming skeptics often praise the benefits of global warming. After all, the opening of the Northwest Passage means better trade routes. CO2 in the atmosphere means healthier plants. And who in northern latitudes would not wish for balmier days?</p>
<p>But there are side effects to our love affair with CO2 that are not often mentioned. In fact, whether the earth cools or warms is absolutely irrelevant to these effects. I repeat: Absolutely irrelevant.</p>
<p>One of the most startling effects is the acidification of the oceans. Since 1750, the oceans have become increasingly acidic. In the oceans, CO2 forms carbonic acid, a serious threat to the base of the food chain, especially on shellfish of all sizes. Carbonic acid dissolves calcium carbonate, an essential component of any life form with an exoskeleton. In short, all life forms with an exoskeleton are threatened: shell fish, an important part of the food chain for many fish; coral reefs, the habitat of many species of fish….</p>
<p><i>The formation of carbonic acid does not depend upon temperature.</i> Whether the oceans warm or cool is irrelevant. Of concern only is the amount of CO2 that enters the oceans. And, as readers of my last thread might remember, we are accelerating our creation of CO2 at an alarming rate. According to the <a href="http://www.energybulletin.net/3768.html">Energy Bulletin</a>, China alone is planning of 562 new coal plants by 2012.</p>
<blockquote><p>“By 2012, the plants in three key countries &#8211; China, India, and the United States &#8211; are expected to emit as much as an extra 2.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to a Monitor analysis of power-plant construction data. In contrast, Kyoto countries by that year are supposed to have cut their CO2 emissions by some 483 million tons.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to one estimate, between 1750 and 1994, oceans absorbed 118 billion tons of CO2—and we were just starting serious CO2 production. As anyone with a fish tank knows, as the pH falls, the water becomes more acidic. Fish life becomes more and more <a href="http://news.mongabay.com/2007/0308-oceans.html">problematical</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This absorption has made the world&#8217;s oceans significantly more acidic since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Research published last year by Mark Jacobson, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, indicated that between 1751 and 2004 surface ocean pH dropped from approximately 8.25 to 8.14. James Orr of the Climate and Environmental Sciences Laboratory further estimated that ocean pH levels could fall another 0.3 &#8211; 0.4 units by 2100.” </p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, <a href="http://news.mongabay.com/2006/0331-uw.html">by 2050</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>“…there may be too little carbonate for [in the Pacific] organisms to form shells as soon as 2050.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since 1990 alone, pH levels in the Pacific have dropped .0025. Such a drop may not seem significant until one understands pH levels.</p>
<p>Both of the articles cited above are well-worth reading in full. The first article is perhaps the most germane, touching, as it does, on the causes of the Permian extinction, the largest mass die-off in the earth’s history. Yes, the oceans became acidic, far more so than ours will by 2100, I think, I hope.</p>
<p>What’s an economist to do with such studies? How do we measure the economic effects? Simply looking at the usual trade-offs doesn’t work. Does the opening of the Northwest Passage count as a gain here? I think not. Do balmier days count as a gain? Nope. And what if the earth is warming because of solar cycles or cosmic rays or giant bonfires stoked by giants in the earth? Not important. What is important is the amount of CO2 we are creating. </p>
<p>If economists understand basic chemistry—and I think they do—,</p>
<p>if they understand that we are producing prodigious amounts of CO2—and I think they do&#8211;,</p>
<p>if they trust the actual pH measurements now being taken—and they should&#8211;, </p>
<p>then the argument is a slam dunk.</p>
<p>I like my old metaphor—and will again trot it out: We are all subprime borrowers. Right now our credit seems good. Life seems good. We look around and behold the miracle of our civilization, on its capacity to grow and on the energy it has harnessed. </p>
<p>But all things have their price; nothing is free. A glass of oil is less expensive, it seems, than a glass of bottled water. But is it? Perhaps we have borrowed too much from the ancient dead, those whose blood and flesh created all that oil. Maybe, like ghosts from the forgotten past, they will demand their own pound of flesh. We borrowed from them. Repayment may be sooner than we think.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;<br />correction.  This from cactus&#8230;  I screwed when I copied Stormy&#8217;s file in and edited&#8230; that&#8217;s pH, not Ph.  My bad.</p>

                                <p>Reader MarkG sends along the following question: </p>
<blockquote><p>Larry Ellison, the CEO and founder of Oracle sold almost $50M in Oracle stock over the last couple months. He did the same thing at the peak of stock market in 2000, selling $100M worth of shares. Does he know something the rest of us do not, or his random selling luckily timed again? </p></blockquote>
<p>I think to answer the question properly, we have to know if he regularly sells $X million or if those are one time events.  My guess &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t have any inside information about the stock market as a whole.  I don&#8217;t see how he or anyone else could.  But I could be wrong.  Anyone think different?</p>

                                <p>This one is by reader Divorced One Like Bush:</p>
<p>Property taxes and commercial development<br /> Our taxes are getting too high!  It&#8217;s not just building the school, it&#8217;s the operation costs that will kill us!  The new teachers contract is coming, more taxes!  You&#8217;re forcing people to move out!  We need commercial development!  We need to cut our taxes!</p>
<p> You know what is missing in this discussion (a discussion happening in every town USA)?  The question: Compared to what?  What are we basing the above statements on?  Is it simply that we have less money after the bills are paid?  Well, from 1955 to 1998, GDP rose by a factor of 20.  Tax burden as a percent of income rose by a factor of 26.7.  But income for a family of 4, 2 people working (sound familiar) only rose by a factor of 11.5.  From 1976 to 2001 the top 1 % share of income went from 8.6 % to 21%.  Yes, we have less money at the end of the day.  Unfortunately, not benefiting from the national wealth as we had in 1955 (when the tax burden was 18% of your pay and would be today if all was equal) is a national policy issue.</p>
<p> So, what about taxes, specifically the property taxes puzzle?  We have less money to pay them and they keep going up.  The usual proposed and acted on solutions are to promote commercial development, sell and move to another town and elect those who promise to cut the taxes.  There is one monstrously missing piece to the puzzle.  Does it work? Do these actions actually result in lower taxes?  I didn&#8217;t know.  So, I looked because the town just OK&#8217;d a 600K sq ft retail shopping development (with an office building and some condo&#8217;s to make it mixed use) across the street from me stating that it would be a financial benefit to the town.   </p>
<p> I can tell you only one  approach for sure will work for sure: moving.  However, you need to  calculate the annual change in the tax rate for a series of years for the towns you are considering.  Commercial development might help.  It&#8217;s a big might.  You have to look at the historical development and the tax rise.  You should look at house values over time while your at it.  Wouldn&#8217;t do any good to move to a town with a low tax rate if what is gained in your pocket  is lost in slow rising house values.  Electing people who promise to cut your taxes doesn&#8217;t work.  Within one to 3 years of the cut, you&#8217;re going to pay.  And beware of towns that have suddenly become popular.  Moving to towns that have become popular is like buying a stock after everyone else has.</p>
<p> That&#8217;s it.  You can keep your taxes low by constantly moving until we have reversed the national trend of less fairly sharing in the national wealth which we all work to create.  But, you have to do your homework.</p>
<p> Do you really want to keep moving?  It&#8217;s not really practical and it could get costly such that the tax advantage is lost.  So, what&#8217;s left?  We can learn the effects of decisions others have made and then apply those lessons to our policies.  Don&#8217;t repeat the mistakes of others.  Brilliant!  Thus, I share the following with all of you in hope that it will begin a more concrete discussion in your neck of the woods concerning managing the tax rate.</p>
<p>  For my work, I went to RIEDC.com because they have historical data on every RI town going back to at least 1986.    I picked towns that I thought covered the spectrum of development and wealth.  They are: N. Smithfield, Burrillville, Cumberland, Woonsocket, Smithfield, Foster, Warwick, W. Warwick, E. Greenwich, W. Greenwich.  These 10 towns represent 26% of RI.  To help you sense the spectrum, Foster is on the Connecticut boarder, had no commercial development and negative population to Warwick with the state airport to W. Greenwich with Amgen, APC, right off interstate 95  and inbetween, including 4 that boarder my town.  I also counted all re-evaluation years as 0.  I then produced a chart of percent change (after charting the raw numbers).</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RflHoRx2MqI/AAAAAAAAAIc/3sxTheJUj8Q/s1600-h/Town_comparison_chart+cropped.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RflHoRx2MqI/AAAAAAAAAIc/3sxTheJUj8Q/s320/Town_comparison_chart+cropped.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p> The first series to look at are the house value rise (percent increase).  The House Val %, is for the most recent 17 years.  Compared to 1991 to 2001 period (Hval 91-01%), there has been a rather large increase in the post 2001 years.  Whether this is good or bad depends on what you value more; a lower tax bill or greater passive wealth.</p>
<p> The next number to look at is something I created to make it easy for me to compare towns.  I wanted a number that reflected the combined value of rise in household income, house value, tax rate and population.  I considered house and income value rise a positive, tax and population rise a negative and found the average.  I labeled it the V factor.  V for viability as these 4 factors reflect the viability of the town as it relates to producing a net positive change in wealth for it&#8217;s citizens.  I admit, very simplistic, but it works.   The higher the better.</p>
<p> Last is the Commercial Ratio.  It is the dollar amount (reduced to xx.x) divided by the V factor.  The lower the number the better.  It was my way of quantifying the commercial development on the viability of the town.</p>
<p> A casual look shows that commercial development will not keep your tax rate down.  Except if you are Burrillville which had one large industrial project; a power plant.  However, it will not produce the rise in household income a town needs and appears to effect the house values too.  Six of the towns have greater commercial development than N. Smithfield and all have higher average annual tax increases.  West Greenwich, with low commercial development did well.  Not seen here is that it&#8217;s development was 78% industrial. But W. Greenwich had a 50% in population.  I believe this is why they are #1 in tax rate increase.  Foster appears the winner.  They even had a 5 year span of negative to zero tax rate changes.  However, by the 3rd year after the streak ended they had a 9.1% hike streak.  That&#8217;s the trend for all towns who try to reverse their tax rate, it goes up big a few years later.  Kind of like the national tax cut game. </p>
<p> But, for my purposes Smithfield (an abutting town) presented the most interesting data.  They had a new retail development go in, but ½ the size of that proposed for my town.  It&#8217;s citizens have seen since 1999 in sequence a 9.8, 4, re-val, 5.5 and 8.7 percent rise in the tax rate.  It&#8217;s commercial development has been only 10% industrial.   My town only had a 6.4% total rise in the same time span.  Also, the state is now spending $350K to redo the exit ramp to that plaza because of the back up onto route 295. </p>
<p> Well, there you have it.  You can move to another town and be successful in lowering your tax rate, for a while.  You might get some help from the right commercial development, but your personal wealth may not rise to it&#8217;s fullest.  Forget the politician that just wants to cut your taxes.  It&#8217;ll catch up to you sooner or later and it will hurt.  Lastly is the town of  East Greenwich an oddity. It is considered a wealthy town if not the wealthiest, but it is not doing well by it&#8217;s citizens in creating personal wealth.  Maybe East Greenwich is showing us a sort of diminishing returns effect, only wealth related?  Or maybe when you have the money you don&#8217;t mind spending it on your town.</p>
<p> By the way.  Just got my new appraisal in.  The town average increase was 20%.  My property?  Went up $550.00.</p>

<blockquote>Republicans charged yesterday that Capitol Hill Democrats are hatching a plan to raise taxes, noting that a new Democratic budget proposal assumes a $400 billion revenue jump over five years without adequately specifying where the money would come from.  The Democratic budget blueprint, released during a hearing of the Senate Budget Committee, suggests that the extra cash could be raised by improving tax collections, closing tax shelters and cracking down on off-shore tax havens. But Republicans argued that those steps would not produce sufficient new revenue to cover the gap. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost like Wizard of Oz tax policy here,&#8221; said Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), the committee&#8217;s ranking minority member. &#8220;There&#8217;s somebody behind the curtain, and we can&#8217;t see who it is, but he&#8217;s going to come up with the money to pay for this.&#8221; That $400 billion gap is just a small piece of the Democratic revenue puzzle, Republicans said. To halt the expansion of the alternative minimum tax beyond 2009, a goal many Republicans share, Democrats would need to find $450 billion more in new revenue. And at least some of President Bush&#8217;s signature tax cuts would expire in 2010 unless still more billions of dollars could be raised elsewhere.  White House Budget Director Rob Portman said the president&#8217;s tax cuts are as good as gone if the Democrats pass their plan. Letting the Bush cuts lapse on schedule in 2010 would mean tax increases for millions of Americans. &#8220;We think it&#8217;s exactly the wrong time to talk about raising taxes,&#8221; Portman said. &#8220;It puts at risk the economic growth and job creation&#8221; that he sees as a consequence of the Bush cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where to start with such horrific writing?  Montgomery suggests a $850 billion gap but over what time period?  Five years?  Ten years?  What is this as a percent of GDP?  I guess it is fair to suggest that the Democrats should be more clear about what they are proposing but for a Republican to toss out “Wizard of Oz tax policy” begs the question – where was Senator Gregg when this White House fed us a parade of Fuzzy Math to defend its fiscal irresponsibility? </p>
<p>Montgomery quotes White House Budget Director Rob Portman as saying 2010 would be the wrong time to raise taxes.  Why is it the wrong time?  When would be the right time?  Montgomery plays Steno Sue and just quotes the “risk the economic growth and job creation” garbage without challenging it.  But Montgomery did offer us this:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been living through fairyland budgets where you think you can have tax cuts for free,&#8221; said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin</p></blockquote>
