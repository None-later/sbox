                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I’ve always been leery of the legal system.  I’ll have a post at some point about my one and only dealing with the legal system at a later date, but suffice to say, that one dealing is the reason I try to avoid having to deal with the system.  The Ex-Girlfriend is less cynical, or perhaps was.  This post is about her recent experience, followed by a few questions.</p>
<p>Here’s our side of the story.  The Ex-GF was negotiating with another individual.  The other individual was to provide some business services and had come highly recommended.  After an initial contact, the other party sent the Ex-GF a proposal.  The Ex-GF requested numerous and significant changes, but anticipating successful conclusions to the negotiations (see the earlier comment on lack of cynicism), made a good will payment equal to $1,000.  Long story short…  13 weeks later, there was still no further proposal.  The Ex-GF made many and repeated attempts to call the other party.  Finally, the Ex-GF finally got through, and told the other party the deal was off.  The other party refused to return the $1,000.  The Ex-GF took her to small claims court.</p>
<p>Two things came up:<br />1.  The guy running the court was clearly not a judge.  He repeatedly referred to the proposal as a contract.  <br />2.  The other party indicated that the Ex-GF made no attempt to contact it.  The Ex-GF did not have her phone records (cellphone and landline) with her, which was a mistake.  </p>
<p>As to item 1, I was under the impression that, a contract requires both an offer and an acceptance.  It seems to make no sense to have someone making decisions, even in Small Claims Court, who is unclear on this.  But on the other hand, if it is I that am unclear on this, I should note that I have in front of me a contract that says Bill Gates owes me $10 billion.  I have another one that notes that the money Warren Buffett intends to give to charity actually belongs to me.  Sure, those bastards refused to sign the contract, but a contract is a contract.</p>
<p>As to item 2… an attorney friend of the Ex-GF (actually, a former boyfriend of hers – does that make him the Ex-GF’s Ex-BF?) says everyone lies in Small Claims Court and nobody cares.  Is that true?  If the Ex-GF were to send photocopies of her phone bills (for three months) to Small Claims Court, would the other party be prosecuted?  If not, why not?  After all, if there is no penalty for perjury, the system cannot work at all.  I understand that the system is not intended to provide justice, but rather to enforce the law, but if its not making any attempt to do either, what use is it?</p>

                                <p>If there wasn’t enough evidence that Zell Miller has gone completely insane, we now have his <a href="http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/shared-blogs/ajc/politicalinsider/entries/2007/03/09/says_zell_military_shortages_s.html">solution to everything</a> is to have more babies grow up in poverty:<br />
<blockquote>It hasn’t gotten widespread play yet, but former U.S. Sen. Zell Miller made a little news this week in Macon when he declared that abortion has contributed to the military’s manpower shortage, the Social Security crisis, and the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States.  “How could this great land of plenty produce too few people in the last 30 years? Here is the brutal truth that no one dares to mention: We’re too few because too many of our babies have been killed,” Miller said.  “Over 45 million since Roe v. Wade in 1973. If those 45 million children had lived, today they would be defending our country, they would be filling our jobs, they would be paying into Social Security,” the former Georgia governor said. “Still, we watch as 3,700 babies are killed every single day in America. It is unbelievable that a nation under God would allow this.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Zell does seem to call for a theocracy here as in “it is unbelievable that a nation under God would allow this”.  After all – we need the government to dictate such choices to woman according to give him hell Zell.  It would seem some of the comments to those who read this post from the Atlanta Journal and Constitution are concerned that kids that grow up in poverty aren’t the solution to a Social Security shortfall but may be adding to it.  It’s good to know not everyone in Georgia is insane as their former Senator – even though <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MTdjNGUzNmQwN2Q4ZjIxZmQ1NTdmMDliYjIwNjU4MWU=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> is.</p>

Thus, the American public is more comfortable if military contracts are given to American companies.  But what if the American companies are not particularly loyal?</p>

<p>Does this mean its time to stop giving Halliburton no bid contracts?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I have posted something like the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/david-altig-on-national-savings-and-why.html">following</a> several times:<br />
<blockquote>the fiscal irresponsibility of the Bush Administration changed all of that so we now have a fairly low national savings rate. David links to several folks who are “reminding us that saving calculated from the National Income and Product Accounts does not really measure changes in the value of assets &#8211; a more appropriate measure of saving” &#8230; So if someone told you that real wealth per capita grew by only 1.1% over a 7-year period, doesn’t that sound like a low net private savings rate? And let’s also remember that real government debt per capita has also grown during this period.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here I was following up on another excellent post from <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2007/02/us_saving_not_q.html">David Altig</a>.   <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/03/undiscourse_sit.html">Brad DeLong</a> let’s us know that Lawrence Kudlow has not been paying attention:<br />
<blockquote>Bob Solow was sitting on the left end&#8211;Solow, Shapiro, Schwartz, Rohatyn, Kudlow, Kerrey, Kosterlitz, Hormats, DeLong. Bob Solow expressed concern and worry over the declines in the U.S. savings rate over the past generation. Larry Kudlow, in the middle of the panel, aggressively launched into a rant&#8211;about how the NIPA savings rate was wrong, about how the right savings rate was the change in household net worth, about how there was no potential problem with America saving too little, that the economy was strong, and that that day&#8217;s employment report had been wonderful, and that Paul Krugman had predicted nine out of the last zero recessions, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  What is one to do? You watch a guy &#8211; Bob Solow &#8211; one of the smartest and most thoughtful people I know, having his intellectual impact neutralized by a guy &#8211; Kudlow &#8211; who really isn&#8217;t in the intellectual inquiry business anymore. Kudlow clearly has not thought through the biases and gaps in the household net worth number: if he had, there is no way he could say what he is saying.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is just a slice of what Brad has to offer on Kudlow’s rant.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_03/010895.php">Kevin Drum</a> picks up on a comment to Brad’s post:<br />
<blockquote>In the law business, I see it all the time. The Federalists put on a panel with one lefty, a few centrists, a few conservatives, and a raving nutbag. Who wins the debate? Who cares? The nutbag is always legitimated by being there. And that&#8217;s the point of the debate.</p></blockquote>
<p>One has to wonder – why was Kudlow invited in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/03/an_intellectual.html">Mark Thoma</a> picks up on a comment from Bruce Bartlett:<br />
<blockquote>When you saw that the organizers had stupidly put too many people on the panel, you should have refused to participate. You should have also asked who else was invited. When you saw that they had invited some whom you view as having insufficient stature to participate, you should have refused to participate. If more scholars did this, conference organizers and talk show producers might improve the quality of such events.</p></blockquote>
<p>This would be <a href="http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9366139">Gresham’s Law</a> in action.  Asking a clown like Kudlow causing a scholar like Brad not to show!  But Bruce is right – Kudlow was to “insufficient stature to participate”.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Newton’s three laws of classical mechanics provide a model that describes much of the world we see around us, the world of macroscopic objects traveling at well below the speed of light, very well.  Put another way – they apply under certain assumptions.  If those assumptions are not appropriate, if you’re trying to describe something that doesn’t match the assumptions at all, you need another model.  Now, are the assumptions ever “true?”  Well, no.  But they can be close enough.  A competent physicist will know, for example, when not to use the classical model, and instead </p>
<p>The same is true in economics.  Consider the perfect competition model.  It indicates that left to its own devices, a market outcome will be perfectly efficient.  While there is no such thing as a perfectly competitive model in the real world, we tend to implicitly take for granted that most of the assumptions of the perfectly competitive model hold, and thus, allowing for competition will lead to the best outcomes.</p>
<p>I note that the perfect competition model is not the only one that produces optimal outcomes.  Given a benevolent all-seeing dictator, you can end up at the same outcome.  But while we all know that a benevolent all-seeing dictator is clearly ridiculous, all-seeing homogenous atomistic firms (to name some of the stated assumptions of the perfect competition model) apparently are not.</p>
<p>But what if the assumptions of the perfect competition model are ridiculous?  For example, here’s an article that points out that <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20011">“there are very few poor students at America&#8217;s top colleges, and a large and growing number of rich ones”</a>.  I don’t think that’s a surprise to anyone.  </p>
<p>Now, it is evident that there is nothing resembling equality of opportunity.  So scratch homogenous among the assumptions.  In fact, scratch atomistic – someone whose family can donate a library to a school has some market power, and it really doesn’t matter what market we’re discussing.  And perfect information is a bad joke.</p>
<p>Now, most of us are perfectly to willing to accept that the idea of a benevolent all-seeing dictator is stupid.  What does it take to reach the same conclusion about the competition model?  For what its worth, let me add &#8211; I believe in competition, but as Gandhi said about Western Civilization, I think it would be a good idea, not one that has ever been tried.  I say let everyone start from the same point, and let those who are smarter, faster, more talented, willing to work harder, or whatnot, come out on top.  But I don’t think that’s what the folks who like to beat their chest and say they’re in favor of competition have in mind.</p>

<blockquote>One more point: Valerie Plame is getting $2.5 million for “her story.” How much did New York publishers and Hollywood producers pay for the stories of Paula Jones and Juanita Broaddrick?</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, President Clinton admitted he behaved like a jerk with respect to Ms. Jones and leave it to Cliffy to dust off that Jane Doe #5 canard.  But the real stupidity of the day goes to the Roundtable of ABC’s <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek">This Week</a> that featured George Will and Torie Clark (ABC failed to mention that Ms. Clark was a Pentagon spokesperson during the Iraq War).  It would seem that most of the panel was pushing the no underlying crime BS so hard that David Corn just sat there. </p>
<p>Will led off with the claim that Novak’s July 14, 2003 hit job was just another news story like the thousands that he has written.  I wonder if our enemies are going over Mr. Will’s past columns to see if he has also outed CIA agents?  Ms. Clark suggested that Ms. Plame was not an important person.  So why do we bother protecting our CIA agents given that these pundits deem them to be so insignificant?  And of course, Libby’s perjury and obstruction of justice was no worse than Bill Clinton being dishonest about adultery. </p>
<p>To think I was mad at my cable network for showing a bunch of high school girls babbling on about horses rather than show Face the Nation.  Maybe ABC should have given the twenty minutes of wasted air time for this parade of pathetically stupid and dishonest pundits to some other high schoolers.  It would have been far more enlightening.  </p>
<p>I tried to find a transcript to this morning’s This Week.  They don’t do transcripts apparently.  I guess I know why.</p>

<p>In plain English, the problem, the obvious problem, is liberals and democracy.  How long before they decide the problems in America have the same cause?</p>
<p>(This was a facetious post.  We&#8217;ve all heard for years that the problems in Iraq are caused by the unwillingness that many of us have to ignore reality and clap louder.  And we&#8217;ve all heard for years that the problems that exist here are rooted in the same place.)</p>

                                <p>Via TBogg, a post about how <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/2007/03/double_surge/">Mitt Romney</a> made donations (for the first time ever) to a number of right wing organizations (including the folks we admire at the National Review) back in December.  Apparently, this was the first time he had contributed to any of these groups, and apparently, some of these groups went from dissing the man to being supportive.  </p>
<p>Lest anyone think this idea is comes from the rarified brain of either<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/something-wicked-this-way-comes.html">Greg Mankiw or Glenn Hubbard</a>, at least two of those first time donations, to the folks at the Federalist Society and our friends at Heritage, came before the worthies were attached to his campaign.  Of course, it is possible the economists ran some numbers and pointed out that the NRO and various &#8220;Citizens for&#8221; (Life, Lower Taxes, etc.) organizations might have broader appeal than those who do nothing but write boring articles about the intent of the Founding Fathers.</p>
<p>I guess the lesson to all is&#8230; its not too late to demonstrate your convictions or otherwise make your quid pro quos if you want to run for President.  On a related note, its probably not too late to create your own <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/">&#8220;Firefighters for&#8221;</a> campaign either.</p>
<p>Full disclosure.  No political campaign has sent me any money.  Yet.  But I&#8217;m still hopeful.  If you find me writing good stuff about Sam Brownback or Tom Tancredo, you&#8217;ll know what happened.</p>

                                <p>Iraq is a mess. (The best description of the current situation I&#8217;ve seen is from <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/2007/03/double_surge/">Matthew Yglesias</a>). Everyone, even GW, is willing to admit things haven&#8217;t turned out as planned. (The plan, as I recall, involved finding WMDs, US troops packing up and going home six months later, etc.) </p>
<p>But things in the economy haven&#8217;t gone according to plan either. And yes, there was an official plan, the administration&#8217;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/budtoc.html">Economic Blueprint</a>. My favorite part is the first and biggest policy initiative &#8211; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">expanding the surplus and paying down the debt</a>.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the economy, there are still plenty of people touting how successful the plan was. How many times have you heard that the tax cuts are working &#8211; the evidence being a small shrinkage in the deficit that didn&#8217;t even exist when GW took office, or a growth rate that is up from the recession? </p>
<p>The signs of failure (i.e., the vast chasm between declared goals and current conditions) are, if anything, bigger when it comes to the economy than when it comes to Iraq. At least with Iraq, GW can claim to have vanquished Saddam. With the economy, he vanquished the surplus. So what accounts for the fact that Fox News viewers are willing to admit there are problems with Iraq, and nevertheless think GW knows what he&#8217;s doing when it comes to the economy?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MTMxOWRkYjgyNDhjOTU5ZTY2OWU2ZTg2ZmUxMzQ1NjQ=">Ramesh Ponnuru</a> of the National Review recently interviewed Senator McCain.  After they discussed the Iraq War, they discussed McCain’s support for Social Security privatization.  It is unfortunately a rather silly set of babbling exemplified by this:<br />
<blockquote>But I don’t think that they got the message of how broken the system is. You see what I mean?</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the fact that Senator has helped President Bush with the disinformation campaign claiming the system is broke, we don’t see what he means.  But it gets worse:<br />
<blockquote>If I were president, I’d have three agenda items (assuming that immigration reform is somehow addressed). Do away with wasteful spending, take every step necessary to do away with wasteful spending. Second, Social Security reform. Third, help Medicare and Medicaid. Why in that order? Because I think you can succeed in the first two far more easily than the third. Because the third is far more complex an issue. I can explain the Social Security problem to any group of Americans in five minutes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cutting waste is fine but if McCain thinks this will solve the massive deficit problem, he is dumber than the National Review nitwits interviewing him.  As far as his explanation of the Social Security problem, it goes something like this.  Social Security is heading for bankruptcy but the magic fairy dust known as privatization offers the free lunch promise that money grows on trees.  Speaking of free lunches, the following is getting all of the attention:<br />
<blockquote>PONNURU: If you could get the Democrats to agree, or at least to come to the table on entitlements or on tax simplification, are those circumstances under which you’d be willing to accept a tax increase?<br />SEN. MCCAIN: No; no.<br />PONNURU:  No circumstances?<br />SEN. MCCAIN: No. None. None. Tax cuts, starting with Kennedy, as we all know, increase revenues. So what’s the argument for increasing taxes? If you get the opposite effect out of tax cuts?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/03/i_can_do_that_v.html">Mark Thoma</a> brings us <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-chait10mar10,0,6317892.column?coll=la-opinion-rightrail">Jonathan Chait</a>:<br />
<blockquote>We all know that? In fact, economists know that this is not true. Conservative economists know this isn&#8217;t true. Even conservative economists who work in the Bush administration have admitted this isn&#8217;t true. &#8230; There&#8217;s really no dispute among economists about that.&#8221; How does McCain explain his conversion to voodoo economics? He doesn&#8217;t. He says things like: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t changed. My record is the same on all issues, which is that of a conservative Republican.&#8221; Which is funny, because a few years ago one of his close advisors &#8211; someone who is now furiously insisting that McCain has always been a staunch conservative &#8211; told me, &#8220;Ideologically, we all changed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark argues:<br />
<blockquote>Given the vast amount that&#8217;s been written concerning tax cuts and government revenue and the broad consensus on the topic, it&#8217;s difficult to believe that any major candidate could be ignorant of the work showing that tax cuts do not increase revenue. If they are ignorant of this broad consensus, or if they choose to simply ignore the evidence and adopt the party line that tax cuts pay for themselves, then questions should be raised about their ability to lead the nation in economic policy. Will they understand enough economics to implement effective policy? If they do understand, will ideology or party loyalty get in the way?</p></blockquote>
<p>While Mark has a very good point, we should remember that McCain was being interviewed by one of the National Review nitwits who remain completely ignorant of the broad consensus that the free lunch brand of “supply side economics” is bogus.</p>
