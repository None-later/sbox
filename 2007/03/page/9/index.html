                                <p>Reader ILSM continues his commentary on the new F-22 fighter.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>I have compared the F-22, a &#8220;fifth generation fighter&#8221;, to a Porsche which has no road to run on.  I have implied there are no threat aircraft out there.  That may or may not be the case.  The only other &#8220;fifth generation fighter&#8221; is the US F-35.  The Russian design houses are working on &#8220;fifth generation&#8221; designs.</p>
<p>Doing a bit of research I find I am in part wrong.  There are potential competitors; some are supposed to be quite equal to the F-22.  Aside from the Russians and Chinese, who use Russian designs and engines, the competitors for the F-22 are Europeans, supposedly our allies.   The Chinese are delivering their indigenous J-10, a generation 4.5.</p>
<p>The recently retired chief of staff of the Air Force, who should be more knowledgeable than I, flew both the F-22 and the Eurofighter Typhoon.  He said the Typhoon was a “NASCAR racer” while the F-22 was a “Formula-1 racer, cannot compare the two”.  I would not buy a car from him.</p>
<p>The F-22 specification was written in 1979, and has been changed a lot over the past 28 years.  The prototype contract was let in 1986, the design selected in 1991 and the first crash took place in Apr 1992.  The first unit received F-22s in 2004, twenty five years! </p>
<p>It has survived huge cost increases, and long delays.</p>
<p>Technical advances in the F-22 are: low supersonic cruise without afterburner, maneuverability, avionics and stealth.  </p>
<p>In comments on another thread, reader Buffpilot said the F-22 shot down 5 or 6 fourth generation aircraft in a scripted flying simulation.  I have seen reported simulations nearer to 1 to 1 with generation 4.5 Typhoon adversaries. </p>
<p>Generation 4.5 jet fighters are: late models of the F-16, F-15 and F-18; the Chinese J-10, a MiG, an Su and the Eurofighter.  </p>
<p>The US has spent 25 years and a huge amount of money to build a totally new aircraft that is marginally equal to the competition in air combat or dogfighting.  So, it needs other work.  It needs to shoot down cruise missiles; which means it needs large numbers and time on station to be a platform for air to air missiles, a job that should be done by older F-16’s with new avionics.  </p>
<p>It needs to be an interceptor, just like the F-106, my generation air defense with delta wings and one engine controlled by off system intelligence.  It is optimized for fighting dog fights but is so expensive it needs to do other things.</p>
<p>Do we really need a dog fighter?  I would propose a look toward the battleship war during WW I.  The battleships were so vital and so expensive that the Germans never came out with them.  The Germans and British deterred each other.  They found other ways to do the war at sea, submarines.</p>
<p>What should the we do if:</p>
<p>The F-22 is barely equal to the Typhoon or J-10?</p>
<p>Is far Superior to the Typhoon or J-10?</p>
<p>Is inferior to the Typhoon or J-10?</p>
<p>My answer to all three potential truths, which we won’t know, is keep working on a design and do not build nor train with the F-22.  The ability of the plane to solve a set of tactical opponents is not clear.</p>
<p>Same for the F-35.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/03/bad-loans-banks-and-coming-credit.html">Kash</a> and <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/183071">Nouriel Roubini</a> are worried that the bad loans in the subprime market may spillover onto the rest of the economy via a credit crunch.  AB reader OldVet points us towards <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/IC16Dj05.html">Jephraim Gundzik</a> who is concerned with increasing perceptions of risk:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plunging stock markets around the world and dollar depreciation indicate that risk perceptions are changing dramatically. This change in risk perception will produce a prolonged and sharp correction in all of the world&#8217;s stock markets. Growing risk aversion will push US Treasury yields lower, triggering dollar devaluation and soaring precious-metals prices in the months ahead.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gundzik argues that the expansionary monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan “masked rising global investment risk”.  He also argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed reversed course in late 2004, but the very slow pace of monetary-policy tightening did little to weaken thriving mortgage-credit growth, which continued to bound higher in 2005. The combination of super-loose monetary policy and very gradual monetary-policy tightening encouraged mortgage lenders in the US greatly to loosen credit standards, triggering unprecedented growth in US real-estate values and home construction. The booming housing market accelerated US economic growth, further obscuring investment risk associated with very rapid credit growth and sharply deteriorating credit standards &#8230; Though monetary policy in the US and Japan remains extremely loose, the sudden downdraft in global equity markets and dollar depreciation, which began early this month, indicate that risk perceptions have changed dramatically. This sudden shift was driven by unexpected weakness in the US economy &#8211; the product of the collapsing housing market, soaring real-estate foreclosures, and their very negative impact on the US financial system.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we are about to see an investment slump – I trust these folks are not saying we need to return to tight monetary policy.  Actually, I tend to agree with Gundzik as he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though interest rates will fall in the US, this will not immediately stimulate a resurgence in the housing market. Mortgage lenders and banks saddled with growing non-performing loan portfolios will continue to tighten credit standards, leaving many potential borrowers in the cold. At the same time, surging foreclosures will add to the housing supply, forcing home prices much lower. This loss of home equity combined with a credit drought will undercut private demand in the US, prompting a rise in unemployment and further weakness in private demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also sounds pessimistic about world business investment demand.  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve does not appear to share this pessimism.  I hope Ben Bernanke is correct, but I don’t envy his job over the next several months.</p>

<p>The Jobs Numbers in Context</p>
<p>Toward the beginning of each month the Bureau of Labor Statistics presents its estimate of the number of jobs created during the previous month. These estimates are usually large numbers, in the tens or hundreds of thousands, and are given with little context. Thus they often elicit lame, misleading or even fantastical statements about their meaning.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of attributed meaning to the March 9 estimate of 97,000 new jobs in February 2007:<br />     • &#8220;Nonfarm payroll employment continued to trend up (+97,000)&#8230;&#8221; <br /><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">BLS News Release, March 9, 2007</a></p>
<p>     • &#8220;Job growth slowed last month but still remained firm&#8230;97,000 &#8212; slightly more than analysts expected.&#8221;  <br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/10/business/10econ.web.html?hp=&#038;pagewanted=print">Jeremy W. Peters, NYT, March 10, 2007</a></p>
<p>     • &#8220;&#8230;economists were generally happy with the latest employment data and said it shows that the labor market remains healthy.&#8221; <br /><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117344634221132150.html?mod=todays_us_page_one">Conor Dougherty, WSJ, March 10-11, 2007</a></p>
<p>     • &#8220;The latest jobs report is further evidence that the doomsayers aren&#8217;t right about the state of the U.S. economy. There were 97,000 new jobs last month&#8230;&#8221; <br /><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117375326105635045.html?mod=todays_us_opinion">Michael Darda, WSJ, March 13, 2007</a></p>
<p>     • &#8220;The U.S. job-creating machine is firing on all cylinders.&#8221; <br /><a href="http://author.nationalreview.com/latest/?q=MjE0OA==">Larry Kudlow, NRO, March 13, 2007</a></p>
<p>Whatever the motivation behind such assertions, sincere or propagandistic, they misrepresent what is actually happening. Furthermore, how does the average citizen relate to an estimate like 97,000? On the face of it, it is just a big number.</p>
<p>To better understand job growth, common analytic methods applied are to: display the raw job numbers over time; use moving averages; chart a function of the number of months after an event like a recession; look at period-to-period percent changes; graph employment-to-population ratios.</p>
<p>What is variously missing in these approaches is, for example, being able to: identify specific months such as September 2001; make meaningful comparisons over time or across administrations; evaluate against some objective criterion; directly take into account US population growth; clearly represent the data so that it can tell its own story.</p>
<p>Interestingly, working-age population data can supply context and further our understanding of the jobs data. The BLS has monthly payroll and population data from January 1948 on. The Bureau’s default working-age population is defined as ages 16 and up. More realistic is to use ages 18-64. It turns out that these data, ages 18-64 beginning with January 1948, correlate highly with the payroll data (simple correlation coefficient > .99). Indeed, a strong correlation makes sense: more people mean more consumers mean more jobs.</p>
<p>As an improvement then, besides the raw or nominal count, the monthly job creation numbers can be expressed on a more human scale, as a rate that adjusts for population growth. This can easily be accomplished by reporting the monthly estimates as the number of jobs created per 1,000 adults (JPT) aged 18-64. That is: {total monthly change in the number of jobs created} divided by {total working-age population in 1,000&#8217;s for that month}. This simple metric would enhance understanding. Furthermore, it would put job-creation numbers in real terms so reasonable comparisons can be made, just as we use the CPI to make dollars comparable over time.</p>
<p>Explicitly recognizing the important role population growth plays in job creation, at least for developed countries, shows that economic policy often affects only the margins of job growth (recall, one JPT is one new job per 1,000 people per month), and can help belie incredible claims about job creation. </p>

Lazear, WSJ, October 2, 2006</a> wrote &#8220;In the past three years [we have added more jobs] than all the jobs added in the European Union and Japan combined.&#8221; Such claims continued to appear on the Whitehouse website at least into February 2007, e.g., <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/02/20070202-3.html">here.</a> Assuming a similar relationship exists between job and population growth with the EU and Japan as with the US, a quick check in the CIA World Factbook and a little arithmetic show that for every one person added to the EU and Japan combined, we put four new people into our population. Of course our job creation is higher. One might just as well claim that “Under our administration we have fewer people per square mile than in the EU or Japan.”</p>
<p>With the JPT index we can put the payroll numbers in perspective. For instance, the average JPT since January 1948 is 1. Since the overall average is 1 and the working-age population is now about 186 million, the March payroll numbers would have to be 186,000 just to be average. Individual data points can be identified and put in context, such as September 2001. Beginning with Truman, the average Democratic JPT is more than double the average Republican JPT. Bush I and Bush II are virtually tied for the lowest average JPT of all administrations, at 0.35 and 0.36 respectively. </p>
<p>Here is a chart to illustrate the value of the index. I believe it speaks for itself, and shows how the example assertions given at the beginning misrepresent.</p>

<p>In addition to displaying the general value of the index, this chart also shows that approximately since June 2005 the aggregate job situation is getting worse. And that is just the aggregate numbers, not about the kinds of jobs.</p>

                                <p>As <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/013087.php">Josh Marshall</a> was listening to Valerie Plame testify on Friday, he reflected upon a certain segment of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Iraq intel report:<br />
<blockquote>The section of the report dealing with Niger, Wilson and Plame is simply a tissue of lies. It&#8217;s a shame on the Democrats who served on the committee who got gamed into approving it. You can read through our archives for detailed discussions of the report&#8217;s contents. But it is a deliberate construction of half-truths, flat out lies and intentional misdirection &#8211; all quite conscious on the part of the authors &#8211; meant to discredit Wilson and thus protect the president. Then-Chairman Roberts (R-KS) prostituted his office by working in concert with the White House to obstruct and misdirect the investigation he was supposedly in charge of leading. And of course the conclusions of the report have become socially acceptable lies repeated endlessly by virtually every Republican in Washington and every conservative editorialist, most recently David Brooks in the Times, but certainly by many others.</p></blockquote>
<p>A very timely reminder in light of the latest dishonest hit job from Faux News’ <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/03/18/hume-plame-oath">Brit Hume</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Today on Fox News Sunday, Brit Hume continued his campaign to smear Valerie Plame Wilson. Previously, he had falsely said that it was “unlikely she was” covert. Instead of apologizing this morning, he launched a new attack against Plame, claiming that she had lied under oath when she testified on Friday about whether she recommended her husband be sent to Niger to investigate Iraq’s supposed nuclear ambitions. Hume said Plame’s testimony “flies in the face of the evidence” adduced by the “bipartisan” Senate Intelligence Committee, which said that “she very much did have something to do with it, that she recommended him and that she put it in a memo.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I linked to the post from Faiz for several reasons.  While Hume wants you to believe that this statement in the intel report was put there by the entire committee, Faiz reminds us that the claim was put there as an addendum to that report by Senators Pat Roberts, Christopher Bond, and Orrin Hatch.  Not that I think that this trio of rightwingers wouldn’t tell all sorts of lies to discredit Wilson and thus protect the president – we should acknowledge that they were supposedly relying upon the testimony of a CIA employee who appeared before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.  But here is the relevant portion of Ms. Plame’s testimony as to what her colleague had testified to:<br />
<blockquote>REP. VAN HOLLEN: So, just so I understand, Mr. Chairman, if I could &#8211; so, there was a memo written by the [Counterproliferation Division] officer, upon whose alleged testimony the Senate wrote its report that contradicts the conclusions <br />MS. PLAME WILSON: Absolutely.<br />REP. VAN HOLLEN: contradicts the conclusions from that report.<br />MS. PLAME WILSON: Yes, sir.<br />REP. VAN HOLLEN: Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that this committee should ask for that memo. And it bears directly on the credibility of the Senate report on this very, very important issue, which they’ve attempted to use to discredit Ambassador Wilson’s mission.<br />REP. WAXMAN: I think the gentleman makes an excellent point, and we will insist on getting that memo.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Faiz notes, this CIA employee wanted to be interviewed again by the committee to correct the distortions placed in this addendum by these three dishonest rightwing Senators.  But the trio refused to consider the offer.  Of course, Brit Hume did not tell his Faux News viewers any of this.  One has to wonder – given how many times Brit Hume was lied to the Faux News audience – why anyone bothers to listen to him?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-assess18mar18,1,7762310.story?page=1&#038;track=rss">Doyle McManus</a> reports on the political implications of the firing of eight prosecutors for Alberto Gonzales, Karl Rove, and President Bush:</p>
<blockquote><p>As more Republicans called last week on Alberto R. Gonzales to resign, President Bush&#8217;s aides began to look beyond the attorney general and focus on preventing the controversy over the firing of federal prosecutors from spreading &#8211; and endangering Karl Rove, the president&#8217;s top political advisor. &#8220;This is not going to go away,&#8221; warned Joseph E. DiGenova, a former U.S. attorney in the Reagan administration. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure the president is going to let it go as long as he can … but there&#8217;s only so much bleeding he can take.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are wondering whether this DiGenova is the husband of the TraitorGate excuser Victor Toensing, you are correct.  The good news in this story is that certain GOP leaders are calling for Gonzales to resign:</p>
<blockquote><p>Several leading Republicans said they expected Gonzales to resign in the next few weeks. They asked to speak on condition of anonymity because their comments conflicted with Bush&#8217;s public position that his attorney general does not need to leave. Two Republican senators, John E. Sununu of New Hampshire and Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, and one Republican congressman, Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach, have publicly called on Gonzales to resign. Others have said privately that the attorney general should leave. And no leading Republican in Congress has stepped forward to defend Gonzales &#8211; a sign that any political support he once enjoyed has virtually disappeared.</p></blockquote>
<p>I bet Mr. Toensing thinks that Sunnunu et al. are sissies:</p>
<blockquote><p>But other Republicans defended Rove. &#8220;There&#8217;s no suggestion of illegality in anything he has done,&#8221; DiGenova said. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t the one making inaccurate representations on Capitol Hill. I would think that would trump any demand [from Congress] for testimony.&#8221; Rove, speaking at a university last week, dismissed the controversy as groundless. &#8220;We&#8217;re at a point where people want to play politics with it,&#8221; he said &#8230; &#8220;The incompetence has been amazing,&#8221; DiGenova charged. &#8220;Managing crises, beginning with preventing crises, is what life in Washington is about…. But these guys didn&#8217;t have a plan ready to answer questions once the problem became public. They still don&#8217;t have their stories straight. &#8220;There are too many Stepford husbands in this administration: young men who are perfectly coiffed and have great clothes, but very few of them have ever been in a courtroom,&#8221; he added.</p></blockquote>
<p>DiGenova probably understands what it means to be a Stepford husband.  All this spin that this controversy does not constitute a crime and is nothing more than a few mistakes and not fully answering questions accurately is the kind of BS that was most likely penned by his wife.  </p>
<p>I have to go now as Senator Feinstein is about to appear on <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/ftn/main3460.shtml">Face The Nation </a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The highlight of Senator Feinstein’s interview on <em>Face the Nation</em> can be found <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/03/18/ftn/main2581974.shtml">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calf., a member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she&#8217;s reserving judgment about whether or not he should resign. But one of the fired U.S. attorneys is from San Diego. Feinstein said Carol Lam was fired after she sent a notice to the Justice Department that she had a case against Dusty Foggo, a defense contractor.  &#8220;The next day, an e-mail went from the Justice Department to the White House saying &#8216;We have a real problem with Carol Lam,'&#8221; Feinstein told Chief Washington correspondent Bob Scheiffer. &#8220;All I&#8217;m saying, as the evidence comes in, as we look at the e-mails, there were clearly U.S. attorneys that were thorns in the side &#8211; for one reason or another &#8211; of the Justice Department. And they decided, by strategy, in one fell swoop, to get rid of seven of them on that day, December the 7th.&#8221; Feinstein said that even though U.S. attorneys are appointed by the President, they have to be politically independent, and she worries that if this issue isn&#8217;t dealt with, U.S. attorneys will not be able to act objectively.  &#8220;That is very difficult for me to believe that you can fire seven prosecutors on a given day, five of whom are involved in major corruption cases one way or another, and the attorney general who is the head of the organization hasn&#8217;t given a go-ahead somewhere along the line,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We need to find that out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Over at ABC’s <em>This Week</em>, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek">George Stephanopoulos</a> interviewed Senators Leahy and Cornyn where this type of behavior was called “politics”.  It is sad to see George Stephanopoulos reading from the White House talking points on this particular controversy.  Cornyn for his part said Senator Schumer had a conflict of interest and to subpoena Karl Rove would turn this investigation into a political witch hunt.  Ahem!</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><strong>Update</strong>: We should stop criticizing m.jed for providing the link to the <a href="http://www.cagw.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&#038;id=10570">CAGW</a> discussion – and we should thank him.  Why?  First – check out this claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush requested $103 billion in emergency spending for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and disaster relief.  The House Appropriations Committee included an additional $21 billion in the U.S. Readiness, Veterans’ Health and Iraq Accountability Act, 2007, that is being marked up today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bush claimed he asked for only $95.5 million suggesting the rest was pork.  CAGW says Bush asked for $103 billion – leaving a smaller difference than Bush suggested.  Secondly, add up what CAGW calls pork and it doesn’t come close to $21 billion.  In a way, CAGW has made my point that not all of the additional proposed spending should be considered pork. </p>
<p>**************************************</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/17/radios.ap/index.html">AP coverage </a> of Bush’s radio address this St. Patrick’s Day was so hilarious that my second pint of beer must wait.  AP wasn’t trying to be funny but I’m not so sure about the President:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8211; President Bush on Saturday accused Democrats who are moving anti-war legislation through Congress of using troops as leverage to win domestic political battles. &#8220;Unfortunately, some in Congress are using this bill as an opportunity to micromanage our military commanders, force a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq and spend billions on domestic projects that have nothing to do with the war on terror,&#8221; Bush said in his weekly radio address.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is from a President who drummed up jingoism to win the 2002 election and abused the Iraq War to win re-election.  But this post is about spending:<br />
<blockquote>Bush repeated his promise that his request for funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan must be approved &#8220;without strings and without delay&#8221; or he will veto it &#8230; The spending bill totals $124 billion, $95.5 billion of which is targeted for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The rest of the funds in the House bill would be distributed among domestic programs unrelated to the wars &#8211; health care for veterans and low-income children, aid to agriculture and more. Republicans said that was a thinly disguised attempt to win support from reluctant Democrats with pork-barrel spending. Democrats said the extra money was for legitimate needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>A couple of things here.  If Bush vetoes this bill – that will delay the authorization of the funds for this misguided Iraq War.  But this suggestion that the approximately $30 billion, which is designated for health care for veterans and low-income children, is pork barrel strikes me as idiotic logic.  More sensible logic would be to tag the $95.5 billion as pork as this whole damn war was Karl Rove’s political strategy.  <em>I need a drink!</em></p>

                                <p><strong>Breaking news on this St. Patrick’s Day!</strong>  <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NjgyMzBiZmU4ZTE5ZTNkMTJlN2NlYThlN2QyMjVjYjg=">Jonah Goldberg</a> has a source that says Joseph Wilson outed his wife.  The source seems to be another <a href="http://www.sweetness-light.com/archive/when-and-why-joseph-c-wilson-iv-outed-valerie-plame">wingnut</a> has just makes it up as he goes.  But compare what Goldberg pulled to what his fellow nutcase really said.  Goldberg’s excerpt:<br />
<blockquote>Given the chronology and Mr. Armitage’s remarks, it seems quite obvious Mr. Wilson outed his wife when he spoke to the Senate Democratic Policy Committee and then to the subsequent reporters at the Times, the Post and elsewhere, when he was hawking his story about his trip to Niger.  Wilson’s motivation for bringing up his wife would have been exactly as Armitage suggested to Woodward. Wilson told the panelists and reporters about Plame’s work at the CIA to give his radically new and dangerous story more credibility. It’s highly probable Wilson used his wife’s position as a WMD analyst at the CIA to bolster his outrageous (and we now know fallacious) claims against a then popular President in a time of war.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fellow wingnut did not claim Wilson told Armitage.  Rather the claim is that Wilson and Nicholas Kristof were at the same May 2, 2003 dinner and had breakfast with Kristof the next day.  There is not a shred of evidence that Wilson told Kristof that his wife was a CIA agent. And notice something else that Goldberg omitted:<br />
<blockquote>Why would Richard Armitage have been talking about Wilson and Plame in June of 2003? This was still weeks before Joe Wilson wrote his New York Times editorial, and a month before Robert Novak published his column mentioning Valerie Plame.  Armitage brought this up because he is a gossip and it was already common knowledge because Joe Wilson had been calling all of the newspapers trying to get them to run his story about his mission to Niger.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Office of the Vice President suspected that Wilson was talking to the press, which is why Cheney’s campaign to smear Joseph Wilson started even before Wilson’s New York Times article.  After all, we KNOW Scooter Libby told Judith Miller that Valerie Plame was a covert agent back in June 2003.  Ah but you protest that Ms. Miller did not run a hit story on Ms. Plame before July 14, 2003!  True but neither did Nicholas Kristof.  But how cold Kristof run such a story since there is no evidence that Wilson told Kristof what Goldberg’s fellow wingnut is alleging.  </p>
<p>Oh well, the liars at the National Review have to attack Valerie Plame with any nonsense they can – even if they look incredibly stupid in the process.  No wonder Jonah Goldberg can’t finish his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-Totalitarian-Temptation-Mussolini/dp/0385511841">stupid book</a>.</p>

If the only clerk at a store refuses to sell alcohol to such an individual, either because they cannot touch alcohol, or (more problematically?) because they feel such rituals are the work of the devil, what happens?  Either way, someone&#8217;s freedom of religion gets trampled.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Regular readers may recall I mentioned the Ex-GF was a wardrobe consultant in the movies for many years.  Now that she&#8217;s decided to get out, she&#8217;s decided I should get in.  After much badgering, I agreed to have headshots made last month.  Thinking this was all a harmless hobby on her part, I let the Ex-GF submit me for a few roles while I went about my business (i.e., economic/statistical consulting).  </p>
<p>A few days ago, it struck home that perhaps this hobby isn&#8217;t harmless after all. I got a callback.  Yesterday afternoon I spent five hours running around in a cop uniform.  (I had one line, but otherwise I&#8217;m background while a couple of detectives try to solve a 30 year old murder in one of those murder re-enactment type shows.)  </p>
<p>Pay for such a thing is dismal, though there&#8217;s a lot of food available, some of it good.  (This is because the cast also eat that food&#8230;.  the actors are merely an excuse to have the production company pay for the meals of those who decide what food is going to be bought.)  And I knew it was dismal going in.  So why do it?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the callback was simply dumb luck and I don&#8217;t expect it to happen again.  (FWIW, I have a lousy voice, and it sounds lousier when reproduced electronically.  I guess I&#8217;d be OK as the nerdy buddy, the professor, or the accountant.)  So I figured &#8211; let&#8217;s see what its like.  A friend of mine, also a non-actor, played a zombie in a low budget movie for the same reason.  I was at the set from mid-afternoon to night.  My friend the zombie was at his set all weekend.</p>
<p>So&#8230; this was entertainment.  Which leads to a thought I had in Vegas about ten years ago.  Everyone knows the house wins in the end.  But people sit with their cups full of quarters, or stand around the roulette or blackjack tables for hours.  Why?  Well&#8230;  I think &#8220;for hours&#8221; is the key part of the sentence.  If they take your money away over a period of 4 hours, in a nice setting, with free drinks, its entertainment.  If they take it away in 5 minutes, its a mugging.  People go back to Vegas because they don&#8217;t feel they&#8217;re getting mugged.</p>

                                <p><strong>Update</strong>: The 22-page statement of <a href="http://republicans.oversight.house.gov/Media/Hearings/20070316WHClassified/ToensingTestimony.pdf">Ms. Toensing</a> shows us several things including what an arrogant twit she is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Under the term “covert agent,” two types of individuals are covered: an officer and an agent. A person working for the CIA is an “officer.” A person who is an informant or source for the CIA is an “agent.” The media often err in this distinction.</p></blockquote>
<p>We bow to her superior intellect as she blames the CIA for TraitorGate:</p>
<blockquote><p>No White House can prudently safeguard classified or otherwise non-disclosable intelligence information (such as covert status) unless its own intelligence agency follows the proper procedures to inform it and its Executive branch clients of that classification or status. If Plame was really covert in July 2003 (or within five years of covert), the CIA was required under the statue to take “affirmative measures” to conceal her relationship to the United States, particularly because the criminal law comes into play.</p></blockquote>
<p>She follows this with a sequence of Byron York style questions that have nothing to do with the claim she is making.  But hey – she sounds smart for tossing out a lot of horse manure.  But then comes the central claim to her entire BS:</p>
<blockquote><p>In his own words, in an autobiography titled, “Politics of Truth,” Joseph Wilson, husband of Plame, reveals the timing of her return from foreign assignment as June 1997, some six years prior to Novak’s July 2003 column.</p></blockquote>
<p>And of course, she never left the safety of the United States from June 1997 to July 2003.  If you believe this then you were not listening to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/03/16/hayden-cia-plame-covert">Valerie Plame</a> earlier in the day:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cummings also asked Wilson to respond to the specific claim, made by Victoria Toensing and others, that Plame had lost her covert status because she “had not been stationed abroad within five years.” Cummings asked, “During the past five years, Ms. Plame, from today, did you conduct secret missions overseas?” She answered, “Yes I did, congressman.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Every bit of Toensing’s BS has been proven to be false over and over – and yet this woman continues to repeat her lies.  Of course, I should thank <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTE2MGE4Y2QyZjQ0YWVhMzg3ZDhiNzAyMjY2NDkyNDM=">Klo</a> even if she to think Toensing had a point (and apparently Tom Maguire does too – go figure).  Speaking of wingnuts being suckered by Ms. Toensing’s serial dishonesty – check out <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=N2JlNjE3MDllNzA4YjBlMTQ2YjU5ZWM5MWNkOTgyYzE=">Andy McCarthy </a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don&#8217;t know all the facts necessary to render a definitive judgment, but it sure seems like Mrs. Wilson is using the continuing sensitivity of facts about her formerly covert STATUS to suggest, misleadingly, that she continued to have a covert RANK once she returned back home and was assigned to headquarters &#8211; where a zillion people a day saw her walk in and out of CIA and the Agency was obviously not trying to conceal the fact that she worked there.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow – a zillion people each day watched Ms. Plame enter Langley?!  I know she’s cute so I hope this was just horny lads and not enemies of the state.  But didn’t Andy listen to Ms. Plame’s testimony in the morning or was he too busy reading the bloviations from the Corner Kids all day?  Or what was that line from Tom Maguire again – sworn testimony from CIA agents can’t count as they are not attorneys.  I guess sworn testimony from the DCIA can’t count either.  </p>
<p>Such a wonderful alternative universe do these wingnuts live in!</p>
<p>******************<br /><a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/03/16/waxman-hearing-panel-ii-part-ii"> Christy Hardin Smith</a> and her colleagues at TraitorGate Central have been doing very good work today covering the hearing chaired by Henry Waxman.  Let’s start with the “testimony” of serial liar Victoria Toensing:<br />
<blockquote>Rep. Waxman goes into how Toensing reached her conclusions.  She says that Valerie is “not a covert agent under the Act.”  Toensing now arguing whether Hayden understands what “covert” means.  Doesn’t know whether she can talk about what was or was not leaked — because Toensing wants to argue about what the meaning of “leak” is?  Do you have first hand information that people at the White House have knowledge that she was a covert agent?  No.  Says she has information only through testimony at the trial. Toensing now going on and on about testimony at trial not including information on covert status again, despite knowing that Judge Walton had a limiting instruction on any testimony regarding covert status information before the trial ever started &#8230; Rep. Cummings going into the Toensing Op-Ed issue — “foreign assignment” parsing of language and statutory authority.  [CHS says: Toensing is filibustering her answers with the Dems.] Ex. Order 12958 – Hayden’s approval of Waxman’s statement that Ms. Wilson’s status was classified, that she was a covert agent protected under the aforementioned Executive Order. Rep. Watson going into the Toensing assertions in her WaPo Op-Ed now.  “It seems to me that your remarks are contrary to Ms. Wilson’s statement here.  Do you still maintain that she was not a covert agent?”  Toensing says “not under the law.”   Rep. Watson is very carefully guarding her time.  Toensing says that she did not talk to either the CIA or Valerie Wilson about Valerie’s employment status.  Toensing says that under “her” statute, Valerie isn’t what she would qualify as “covert” in her legal interpretation.  Rep. Watson says she isn’t asking about IIPA – in contrast, she’s asking about Administrative rules under the Executive order.  Prohibits both reckless and negligent disclosures of classified information – and violates the executive order even though it does not violate the IIPA?  Toensings stalls and tap dances and then asks for the question to be repeated.  Yes, that is correct.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, we also heard from DCIA Hayden as well as Ms. Plame herself as to the fact that she was covert.  Why Ms. Toensing who has never had a clue would testify to the contrary is just beyond me.  But there’s more:<br />
<blockquote>Toensing now blames David Corn for Valerie&#8217;s disclosure &#8211; says David published Valerie&#8217;s covert status before Novak.   Van Holen says he understands her focus is on the criminal aspect, but that he finds it stunning that the WH has never done any investigation into the disclosure.  Toensing says &#8220;shame on the CIA.&#8221;  Toensing now blaming Grenier for not telling the Vice President and/or Libby that Valerie&#8217;s status was classified or covert  says this came -from corss-examination testimony.</p></blockquote>
<p>Corn’s article ran on July 16, 2003 whereas Novak’s ran on July 14, 2003.  Could somehow give Ms. Toensing a calendar?  But there is where it got fun:<br />
<blockquote>Waxman says that he is going to hold the record open, and check Toensing&#8217;s statements on the record.  Waxman says he will be checking with Fitzgerald on his interpretation of the law.  [CHS asks:  Is it me, or is that a &#8220;correct the record, or there may be a perjury question in the offing if we find errors in your testimony?&#8221;]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh joy!</strong>  Victoria Toensing serving time in prison for perjury!  <br /><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/03/16/hayden-cia-plame-covert">Nico</a> at ThinkProgress has Ms. Plame’s testimony on this matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cummings also asked Wilson to respond to the specific claim, made by Victoria Toensing and others, that Plame had lost her covert status because she “had not been stationed abroad within five years.” Cummings asked, “During the past five years, Ms. Plame, from today, did you conduct secret missions overseas?” She answered, “Yes I did, congressman.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/03/16/plame-covert-testimony">Faiz</a> at ThinkProgress details some of the others who have lied about this – followed by “We await their apologies and statements of correction.”  Faiz also reminds us of another lie by <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTg1MTdlZGE4OWVmOWUyMTA3ZDcxMTNiM2RjZjYwYjk=">Jonah Goldberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But it sounds like the leaker is dropping in rank and importance as is the transgression. Wilson&#8217;s wife is a desk jockey and much of the Washington cocktail circuit knew that already.</p></blockquote>
<p>So now that their serial lies have been exposed, let’s check on what the <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/">Corner Kids</a> have been saying today.  Read them all – they are still lying.  They better be glad they were not under oath today.</p>
