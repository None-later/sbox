<p>This from <a href="http://hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc070319.htm">Steve Hussman</a>, manager of the Hussman Fund 3/19/2007.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>“Among all FDIC insured institutions, total assets represented $11.8 trillion at the end of 2006, of which about 40% were real-estate related loans. Though foreclosures currently represent just over 1% of total mortgage debt outstanding, it&#8217;s important to remember that the average return on assets (earnings as a percentage of assets) in the U.S. banking system is also only about 1%. So any continuation in defaults will quickly find its way into earnings figures, either by provisions for loan loss reserves or by actual charge-offs.</p>
<p>Remember also that banks operate on a ratio of about $10 of assets (generally loans outstanding) per $1 of shareholder equity capital. So a 1% loss of existing loans can wipe out about 10% of shareholder capital. Since banks are required to hold such capital against their loan portfolio, wiping out capital also wipes out part of their ability to originate new loans. Importantly, bank capital requirements are a separate constraint from the reserve requirements placed on a bank&#8217;s demand deposits</p>
<p>Note the difference. Reserve requirements apply to the liabilities of a bank (basically customer deposits), while capital requirements apply to the assets of a bank. If banks have insufficient reserves to meet, say, the demand of customers for cash, the Fed can intervene by buying up Treasury securities from banks and paying with reserves (this is what the FOMC really does when we talk about a “Fed rate cut”). Banks can then meet their obligations to depositors without having to call in loans. This is a legitimate “lender of the last resort” function for which the Fed actually does have a critical role (as I&#8217;ve noted elsewhere, except during banking crises, the Fed&#8217;s powers to affect the economy are largely imagined). While some individual banks may be at greater risk than others, we should not be concerned about a general banking failure, precisely because of the Fed&#8217;s ability to act as a lender of last resort.</p>
<p>But capital requirements impose a different constraint altogether. A Fed easing might loosen a binding constraint on bank reserves, but it does not increase shareholder equity capital. Loan losses still go straight to the bottom line, and if the losses are sufficient to reduce shareholder capital, they also limit the amount of new loans that banks can make. It&#8217;s that risk of earnings weakness and “de-leveraging” of the U.S. financial system (not the risk of a general banking collapse), that is a growing concern here.</p>
<p>That is not to say that the Fed is anywhere close to “coming to the rescue” here. The latest inflation figures were fairly hostile to any hope for a near-term rate cut. Meanwhile, overall U.S. capacity utilization has pushed up to 82% &#8211; a level at which the Fed has historically been much more inclined to raise rates than lower them. To call this a “Goldilocks” environment where inflation and economic risks are balanced is like the proverbial image of the guy with his head in the freezer and his feet in the oven, saying the temperature is just right. Inflation and economic risks are balanced because both are unfavorable.”</p></blockquote>

                                <p>This one is by reader CoRev. It highlights a big problem. Rape is a horrific crime. Falsely accusing someone of rape is also. My suspicion is that there are a lot of women out there who have been raped by a criminal that went unpunished, and a lot of men who have been falsely accused. I also believe that false accusations of rape make it much harder to prosecute real rapists, which means more rapists moving freely through society and more women becoming rape victims. Being a data kind of guy, as I read CoRev&#8217;s post, I tried to think of how to test the magnitude of the problem. Sadly, I have no idea.</p>
<p>Note also.  This post is on a sensitive subject.  I assume reader CoRev wrote it in the most delicate way he could.  However, I&#8217;ve found from my own writing, when tackling controversial topics its easy to write something that can be misinterpreted.  Please keep that in mind as you read this.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>False Rape Claims are Real and Disastrous for the Accused</p>
<p>A secret that feminists do not want out is that Women Lie About Rape. The past year has had a spate of highly publicized rape claims which have proved to be in kind terms, erroneous, or in less kind terms, false. Three come to mind immediately, 1) Duke lacrosse (LAX), 2) US Naval Academy Midshipman Lamar Owens (LO) and the US Air force Academy&#8217;s (USAFA) multiple rape claims. The military cases have completed the criminal justice system and the accused have been acquitted, while Duke Lax has been removed from the prosecutors hands. Why are these cases being brought and lost? Because they were not true from the beginning.</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s study courses universally teach just the opposite. Common teachings include: Women don&#8217;t lie about rape. Why would they, it is so painful. Even when they do it is no more than the average of other crimes, two percent. </p>
<p>Two percent? Where did this come from? A <a href="http://llr.lls.edu/volumes/v33-issue3/greer.pdf">study of feminist research</a> documents done by Edward Greer has shown that the claim is a pyramid interlocking and circular references originating from Susan Brownmiller&#8217;s &#8220;Against Our Wills&#8221;. And, the research that Ms. Brownmiller cites? A seminal comment, not researched, by Lt Julia Tucker, former commander of the New York city Sex Crimes Analysis Unit, provided for a New York Judge giving a speech before the New York Association of the Bar, Jan. 16, 1974. </p>
<p>What we have is a &#8220;consensus fact&#8221;. All literature leads to the same facts; therefore, it MUST be true.</p>
<p>Contemporary studies, most better documented than leading feminists, show just the opposite. <a href="http://www.falserape.net/false-rape.htm">This link</a> summarizes findings from a variety of reports. But, be assured that these reports do exist. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.falserape.net/falserapeafa.htm">A summation of several studies</a>, including references, shows that as many as half of all rape claims may be false. Most reports show that the actual number is actually at least ten times the &#8220;Women&#8217;s Literature&#8221; claims.</p>
<p>Once a woman cries, &#8220;Rape,&#8221; the man she points to is seen as guilty&#8211; and the courts make it easy to condemn. Indeed in the Military Services there are victims Support Offices. Cry rape and automatically the accuser is a victim, has a formal infrastructure to support her, and, is usually given transactional amnesty for anything that may come out in her testimony. </p>
<p>The accused has NO SUPPORT. He must pay for his legal fight, and whether he wins or loses his life is scarred. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.falserape.net/false-rape.htm">Reasons some women do it include</a>:</p>
<p>1· to create an alibi,<br />2· to get revenge,<br />3· to get attention or sympathy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next time you hear the story line: &#8220;Stop, or I&#8217;ll claim rape!&#8221; Think about the message being sent to American man and women. Does it reinforce the erroneous teaching in the women&#8217;s study programs. More over, is it a result of the teachings? False rape claims are much higher than what is taught and much more damaging than thought.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Back to cactus&#8230; When I was in college, I had a job giving tennis lessons. One of my students was a girl about thirteen. Her home shared a tennis court with several other homes. Oftentimes, after the lesson, we&#8217;d walk to her house and I&#8217;d find nobody was there. Having grown up in a dangerous place, I wasn&#8217;t about to simply walk away and let a thirteen year old girl walk into a large empty home by herself. On the other hand, I wasn&#8217;t about to walk into a house with a thirteen year old girl either for reasons similar to those detailed by CoRev above. My solution was to sit on the stoop with the door of the house open while she checked every room in the house. She mocked me for it every time &#8211; and let me tell you, you haven&#8217;t been mocked until you&#8217;ve been mocked by a thirteen year old girl.</p>

It seems with the scandals, its becoming safe for people who should have spoken up earlier to speak up now.</p>
<blockquote><p>The leader of the Justice Department team that prosecuted a landmark lawsuit against tobacco companies said yesterday that Bush administration political appointees repeatedly ordered her to take steps that weakened the government&#8217;s racketeering case.</p>
<p>Sharon Y. Eubanks said Bush loyalists in Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales&#8217;s office began micromanaging the team&#8217;s strategy in the final weeks of the 2005 trial, to the detriment of the government&#8217;s claim that the industry had conspired to lie to U.S. smokers.</p>
<p>She said a supervisor demanded that she and her trial team drop recommendations that tobacco executives be removed from their corporate positions as a possible penalty. He and two others instructed her to tell key witnesses to change their testimony. And they ordered Eubanks to read verbatim a closing argument they had rewritten for her, she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>News reports on the strategy changes at the time caused an uproar in Congress and sparked an inquiry by the Justice Department. Government witnesses said they had been asked to change testimony, and one expert withdrew from the case. Government lawyers also announced that they were scaling back a proposed penalty against the industry from $130 billion to $10 billion.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I kid you not – the man who let the world know that Valerie Plame was a CIA agent is at it <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/21/AR2007032101788.html">again</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Republican Rep. Peter Hoekstra could hardly believe what he heard on television Friday as he watched a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing. Rep. Henry Waxman, the Democratic committee chairman, said his statement had been approved by the CIA director, Michael Hayden. That included the assertion that Valerie Plame Wilson was a covert CIA operative when her identity was revealed.  As House intelligence committee chairman when Republicans controlled Congress, Hoekstra had tried repeatedly to learn Plame&#8217;s status from the CIA but got only double talk from Langley.</p></blockquote>
<p>Say what?  All you have to do if you want to know whether someone is a CIA agent is to call the CIA?  Of course, they tend to give double talk.  But this rightwing hack who only pretends he is a reporting continues with his dissembling:</p>
<blockquote><p>But Hayden, in a conference with Hoekstra yesterday, still did not answer whether Plame was covert under the terms of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.  The former CIA employee&#8217;s status is critical to the attempted political rehabilitation of former ambassador Joseph Wilson and his wife &#8230; Claims of a White House plot became so discredited that Wilson was cut out of Sen. John Kerry&#8217;s presidential campaign by the summer of 2004. Last week&#8217;s hearing attempted to revive a dormant issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep – Novak is still trying to paint Joseph Wilson and his wife as liberal Democrats.  He knew better when he trolled the Federal Election Commission files, which ultimately led him to out the rest of Plame’s CIA colleagues. But read the whole pathetic op-ed as Novak dusts off just about all of the discredited talking points.  My only question is why the Washington Post would run the musings of a serial liar and partisan hack who did way too much damage back in the summer of 2003?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I’ve recently had a few posts looking at whether the Fed acts to improperly influence elections.  I want to take a step back, and consider the purpose of the Fed.  Quite simply, the purpose of the Fed is to regulate the money supply, which means to ensure that there is always enough liquidity to lubricate the economy, but not enough for there to be runaway inflation.</p>
<p>The Fed’s primary tool for changing the money supply directly through open market operations.  When it wants to increase the money supply, it buys treasury bonds with money it creates from thin air, thus putting the money it created from thin air into circulation.  When it wants to decrease the money supply, it sells treasury bonds from its stash, and in effect destroys the money the bond buyers paid for those bonds.  When the money supply is loose, people are more willing to spend, and when the money supply is tight, people are more likely to sit on money.</p>
<p>But the Fed has are other ways to influence the economy, such as changing the Fed Funds rate.  When interest rates fall, people’s spending goes up, and when interest rates rise, people’s spending goes down.</p>
<p>Thus, the Fed both reacts to the economy, and causes changes in the economy.  Which leads?  Table 1 below shows how real M2 per capita correlates with real GDP per capita using data going back to 1959 – when the Fed’s M2 series begins.  (Note…  since GDP data is quarterly, M2 data was converted to quarterly by using data for three month averages ending in March, June, September and December.)</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RgJzw0YJ08I/AAAAAAAAAJE/FBKanxwSVQk/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+8,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RgJzw0YJ08I/AAAAAAAAAJE/FBKanxwSVQk/s320/Fed+Independence+8,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>What does this show?  Well, quarterly real M2 per capita is correlated with real GDP per capita, mostly on a real time basis – neither real M2 per capita nor real GDP per capita “leads.”</p>
<p>Now, let’s say we believe the Fed tries to actively manipulate elections.  In that case, we would expect to see the biggest increases in real M2 per capita occur before elections in which an incumbent the Fed is friendly with is running for office, and we’d expect to see the smallest increases (and actual decreases) in real M2 per capita.  Regular readers recall this is precisely what we saw <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and_05.html">in an earlier post</a>.  </p>
<p>But a true cynic would not stop there.  He or she might feel that if the Fed is trying to influence an election, the Fed would start well before the election, and the Fed would bring as many of its tools to bear as possible, not just the money supply.  He or she might also feel that such manipulation would take time, and thus the manipulation would occur before the results are seen.  Put another way… in years leading up to elections that the Fed wants to influence, there will be a higher (absolute) correlation between the real M2 per capita and lags of real GDP per capita than between real M2 per capita and (unlagged) real GDP per capita.  The cynic would also feel that in years when there is no election, the Fed would not engage in those shenanigans, so the correlations would behave pretty much as they do in Table 1 above, in that the highest correlation are “real time.”</p>
<p>Which leads us to Table 2.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RgJzrEYJ07I/AAAAAAAAAI8/PVEo6cgWyL4/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+8,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RgJzrEYJ07I/AAAAAAAAAI8/PVEo6cgWyL4/s320/Fed+Independence+8,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So what do we see here?  </p>
<p>In years in which there is no election (column 1), the highest absolute correlations between real M2 per capita and real GDP per capita occur in real time.  Check.</p>
<p>In years in which the there is an election that the Fed wants to influence (columns 3 and 4), changes in the money supply will lead changes in the economy.  Not so true in column 3, but as reader Sebastian Holsclaw never tires of pointing out, column 3 only has 2 observations.  As to column 4, it looks pretty definite.  Hence, check.  </p>
<p>Now maybe you don’t think the Fed has all that much control over M2, or you like your correlations higher before you reach conclusions.  Well, in that case, I was saving this table using real M1 per capita just for you.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RgJzgEYJ06I/AAAAAAAAAI0/e5MX4bhZAf4/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+8,+Table+3.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RgJzgEYJ06I/AAAAAAAAAI0/e5MX4bhZAf4/s320/Fed+Independence+8,+Table+3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(The earlier post looking at real M1 per capita <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and_06.html">is here</a>.)</p>
<p>Extremely high correlations, and every one of the cynical predictions hold true with Real M1 per capita.  Check, check, and check.</p>
<p>So… from earlier posts on this topic, we learn that the Fed manipulates the real money supply in precisely the way we’d expect if we were cynical enough to believe the Fed wants to manipulate elections.  In this post, we learn that it actually has an effect on the economy, in fact, precisely the effect we’d expect if we were very cynical.  At some point, one has to conclude this is not a coincidence.  At some point, one has to conclude the fed is purposely manipulating the economy to influence elections, in violation of who knows what laws and even its own charter. </p>
<p>I haven’t chance to write it up yet, but I’ve also been looking at the real growth rate in the economy and the real growth rate of the real money supply per capita.  When I get a chance, I’ll have a post showing both in November of each year, broken out by whether there is an election, whether there is an incumbent running, etc. </p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/013171.php">Josh Marshall</a> and his TPM team have been the driving force in the reporting of the prosecutor purge scandal.  Josh broke the news early this morning that there may have been an 18 day gap between November 15 and December 4:</p>
<blockquote><p>The firing calls went out on December 7th. But the original plan was to start placing the calls on November 15th. So those eighteen days are pretty key ones.</p></blockquote>
<p>But not fast as there were a few emails from this period as reported <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_5487582">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a frank e-mail exchange, Brent Ward complained to senior Justice Department officials about resistance from several U.S. Attorneys to prosecuting obscenity cases. Those complaints apparently contributed to the later, now controversial firings of prosecutors Daniel Bogden in Nevada and Paul Charlton in Arizona. Ward, the head of a federal obscenity task force, wrote that the opposition was eroding interest from the FBI and jeopardizing the still-fledgling initiative.  The former U.S. Attorney in Utah went so far as to ask Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to weigh in and order the prosecutors to pursue the cases.  Ward&#8217;s complaints later were cited as a reason for the terminations of Bogden and Charlton, according to a trove of documents the Justice Department has turned over to Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this Salt Lake Tribune reporter being gullible?  I smell a rat.  Our friends at <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/03/21/a-second-set-of-emails-from-the-gap">ThinkProgress</a> must be smelling the same rat:</p>
<blockquote><p>it makes sense that the administration would include this set of emails and apparently virtually nothing else from that 18-day-gap, since the emails from Ward bolster the administration’s case that the firings were based on performance-related concerns.</p></blockquote>
<p>How stupid does George Bush think we are!</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I have been thinking of this for some years now. I heard this at a site I still visit, and I think readers here may have some ideas.</p>
<p>A bit of the economics of our military &#8220;investment process&#8221;.</p>
<p>In 2007, military procurment is about $84.2B. This is nearly 63% (constant dollars) of what was spent in 1986 at the height of the Reagan build up. The 2005 procurement funds were closer to 75% of the Reagan build up advancing from about 40% in 2001.</p>
<p>If a typical weapon system costs 15% of its total life cycle cost to design and test, another 20% to produce, and the remaining 65% to operate and sustain to keep the force trained and ready to go to war. This is historical record. I would expect to see the operations and maintenance budget about twice the size of the procurement and R&#038;D budgets. Not the case.</p>
<p>The 2007 defense budget is about 37% to buy new equipment (procurement and R&#038;D), 37% to operate and support the equipment we have, with new stuff arriving all the time. The remaining 25% for the military personnel costs.</p>
<p>To keep the new and old equipment in good shape and ready to use in war, the department should spend a lot more (twice in operating funds to procurement funds in my opinion) than roughly the same amount as procurement it spends now.</p>
<p>This divergence may be an emphasis on new stuff over keeping what we have in prime condition.  This reflects the fact that more money is made by the military industrial complex by selling new stuff than maintaining the stuff we have.</p>
<p>The industrial complex does not make much money developing things as that is usually cost plus a modest profit. The industry does not make much money repairing things because that is also cost plus modest profit.</p>
<p>Industry makes a good profit on fixed price production where the costs are not related to the price and so margins can be widened.</p>
<p>The new stuff comes out and is like the B-2 broke most of the time. Theoretically, it is referred to as infant mortality. More things break on new things especially when the design and production processes are not so good.</p>
<p>As we continue to buy more new stuff, we build a tidal wave of support costs which in the future will compete for funds with &#8220;needs&#8221; to buy new stuff.</p>
<p>Eventually something gives and it is ability of all the stuff we have to do the job, because we deferred repairs and training so that we could buy new stuff which is soon to be left to rust as even newer things are bought.</p>
<p>Reduced training and huge down time, means there is no real need for the stuff.</p>
<p>Things that are broke all the time, because we never spent enough to keep them up, are then a justification for new things and the bow wave ebbs and flows. Never enough money to keep the stuff running, but always enough to buy new things which won&#8217;t be running either.</p>

                                <p>Hoisted from comments, Brad de Long-style.  I&#8217;ve taken the liberty of slightly editing some comments by reader Buffpilot that might help one understand where some of the costs of operating the military go.  His comments focus on bombers.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Training: B-2 bomber pilots get two sorties/month in the B-2. They also get time flying T-38 trainers and fly one of the most realistic combat simulators around. The B-52/B-1 pilots fly 4-5 sorties/month but have crappy simulators and no T-38s. Costs per flying hour go on a ratio of 1/2/6 (B-52/B-1/B-2). The B-1 and B-52 costs would be roughly the same, but the B-1s still practice low-level flying which beats the planes up more and sucks down a lot more gas/hour. B-52s fly high only and by one measure costs roughly $20K/hr to fly in 2000 (how you calculate this number varies widely but the ratios stay the same). B-2 costs are almost totally due to keeping them stealthy. The B-2 actually reports two MC rates, one with stealth and one without, and the numbers you see above (33% with stealth, 80% without) haven’t change since I was tracking it in the pentagon in 2000. All the bomber units sit around an 80% readiness rate at any one time.</p>
<p>Readiness:  All the bombers are on a 5 year rotation for depot-level maintenance. Thus roughly 2-3 B-2s are always ‘in the shop’ (as are, for example, 7-9 B-52s). 1-2 will be out constantly for MX training and base-level modifications/maintenance (but can come up quickly). Of the rest a certain % will be kept at the highest readiness level for quick reaction tasking, the 33% mentioned above, i.e. 6-7 aircraft, the rest of the fleet will be used for your day-to-day pilot training. They will churn the aircraft through all these activities to maintain and even wear on the planes. </p>
<p>Crew:  The bombers are only manned at a 1.2 crews/plane. Over Afghanistan that meant a time line for a B-52 crew would look like this. Takeoff fly 16 hour mission and land. 3 hours postflight (debrief, mx, etc). Then roughly 36 hours off time, show 3 hours prior to takeoff and repeat. For months. It was very tough on the flyers and beat them up. On the plus side no one could really shoot at you, though we did loose a B-1 due to a nighttime electrical malfunction.</p>
<p>Use:  The B-2s have seen very little work over Afghanistan of Iraq and are not usually deployed anymore since we ran over Iraq. They are not needed; we have bases in both of those countries and operate fighters from inside the countries.</p>

                                <p>This post is by Ole Keynesian.  He ponders not just GDP, but dumpster diving.  How cool is that?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/49547/">article</a> from Alternet just caught my eye.  It describes a new class of dumpster divers, self-proclaimed &#8220;freegans&#8221;.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Freeganism (a conjunction of &#8220;free&#8221; and &#8220;vegan&#8221;) is the philosophy that participation in our capitalist economy makes a person complicit in the exploitative practices that are used to create consumer goods. One freegan defines the term as &#8220;living beyond capitalism,&#8221; which can involve any number of practices: urban foraging, hopping trains, volunteering in lieu of working a paying job, repairing things like bikes and clothes instead of buying new ones, squatting instead of paying rent.&#8221;</p>
<p>To test the theory that enough food is thrown away to sustain body and soul, the author embarks on a three day grocery shopping trip through the trash bins.  By the time the experiment ends she is calorically satisfied and mentally enlightened: &#8220;&#8230;So 5.4 billion pounds of food were lost at the retail level in 1995. So half the food produced in this country never gets eaten&#8230;.But now that I&#8217;ve had to throw away good food I&#8217;ve foraged from the trash to make room in the fridge for even better food, now that I&#8217;ve passed up wrapped cinnamon buns not because they&#8217;re stale, but because there are fifty of them, it&#8217;s started to sink in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uneaten food, which passes through the entire value chain as wasted effort and resources, is nevertheless added to this country&#8217;s GDP and counted as a share of economic growth.  But this is only one example of the prosperity story being told by a metric that doesn&#8217;t accurately measure prosperity.  </p>
<p>The Everyday Economist wonders what benchmark would better evaluate the health of the economy.</p>

                                <p>Via Pharyngula, there may be a way to eliminate malaria, but the way to do it is <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/03/curing_malaria_by_helping_mosq.php">to make mosquitoes healthier</a>.  Talk about a trade-off.  Who knows what effect there would be to making the mosquito population healthier?</p>
<p>What if it were possible to eliminate mosquitoes completely.  Would that be a good idea?  Perhaps, but I assume there&#8217;d be a cost, maybe some birds or lizards or other (beneficial) insects might go extinct as well.</p>
