                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Economists have been advocating a tax on oil and/or gasoline for as long as I have been an economist.  More recently, Greg Mankiw has even started a Pigou Club on <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/">his blog </a>  .  I agree with it myself but the problem is that in the current political climate ANY kind of tax increase is unlikely and even if it werent, a tax big enough to offset the externalities of our huge oil demand would be extremely damaging in the short run – enough so to make it a bad idea from a short run economic as well as political point of view.</p>
<p>I will go out on a limb and say it will be a cold day in hell when President Bush proposes such a tax.  Not only is it against his religion (no taxes, none, not ever, not for any reason) but it is also against the interests of his oil industry friends.  He has yet to go against either of these and I don’t expect him to change in tonight’s State of the <place st="on">Union</place> or anywhere else.</p>
<p>But what OUGHT we to want even if our benighted leader cant bring himself to propose it?  Other commentators (See for example, knzn   <a href="http://knzn.blogspot.com/">here </a> ) have discussed whether oil demand elasticities are high enough to &#8220;work&#8221; and beyond that the developing world (especially China and India) is the place where demand growth is likely to be the highest, but there are several considerations that make a Pigovian tax a good idea and a simple implementation plan that would make it both more feasible and more effective.</p>
<p>Though demand growth is projected to be huge in China and India it is undeniable that the US consumes a disproportionate share – more than a quarter &#8211; of world oil demand at the present time ( See  <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/oil.html">here </a>  )  The <country-region st="on"><place st="on">U.S.</place></country-region> can and should be a leader on this issue since we are one of the main reasons for the high level of demand.  In fact, our intransigence has done more to stymie global climate treaties than any other single factor.</p>
<p>Though short run oil demand elasticities may be low, long run ones are without a doubt much higher.  But even this understates the importance of raising the price of oil.  The main goal is NOT to encourage more conservation within our current technological base though that is a good idea and the experience of the past year shows that the effects can be significant.  Rather it is to encourage development of new non-oil technologies to replace our foreign dependence altogether.  New technologies will only become economically feasible if/when oil becomes more expensive and is widely perceived as certain to remain so.</p>
<p>And there is perhaps the biggest problem – If we in the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">US</place></country-region> are successful in lowering oil demand the result will be lower oil prices for us and everyone else with a consequent loss of the incentive to consume less and with the added problem of undercutting the profitability of any potential new technology.  How to get around this?  A tax big enough to ensure the viability of alternative technologies over the long run.  In essence we want to speed up the incentive to invest in new technologies by not waiting until world oil prices force it on us.  But how to make a tax big enough to accomplish this without taking the short run economic hit noted above?</p>
<p>The answer to this is to phase it in gradually over a long period.  An oil tax that added a dollar a barrel each year for the next two or three decades would not only provide the long run certainty that would be needed to risk development of new technologies but it would also be gradual enough not to cause any short run disruptions.  It would be at least two or three years before it even brought <country-region st="on">US</country-region> taxes in line with what already exists in <place st="on">Europe</place> but could be raised to whatever point is needed to provide an adequate incentive to develop alternatives as well as a Pigovian offset.</p>
<p>Politically, this idea would be a lot easier to sell than a single large tax increase would be.  No politician would be forced to do something massively unpleasant in any single year or election cycle, while appeals to the need for energy independence would go far in convincing voters of the need for sacrifice.  Indeed, is there <i>anybody</i> left in the country who doesn’t think it would be a good idea not to need to worry about foreign oil supplies?</p></p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As a follow up to my (admittedly simplistic) post yesterday <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/optimal-amount-of-tax-collection.html">optimal tax collections</a>, I noticed that there is one interesting bit of information in the spreadsheet, still untouched, that would make a nice post by itself.</p>
<p>So how does growth (in real GDP per capita) look for deficits of different size?  Letting A equal deficits > 4% of GDP, B equal deficits between 2% and 4% of GDP, C equal deficits between 2% and 0% of GDP, and D be surpluses, and using data going back to 1950:</p>
<p>__________A_______B______C_______D<br />t to t+1___2.81%___1.89%___2.81%___0.46%<br />t to t+2___2.75%___1.98%___2.34%___1.18%<br />t to t+3___2.49%___1.91%___2.34%___1.46%<br />t to t+4___2.17%___1.96%___2.26%___1.77%<br />t to t+5___2.11%___2.00%___2.28%___1.74%<br />t to t+6___1.86%___2.12%___2.20%___1.84%<br />t to t+7___1.89%___2.11%___2.20%___1.90%<br />t to t+8___1.92%___2.13%___2.11%___2.28%</p>
<p>As an example of how to read the table, the annualized growth rate, over a seven year period beginning in a year when deficits lie between 0 and 2% of GDP is 2.20%.</p>
<p>What does this show?  Well, over the short run, say, one to three years, the largest growth rates are associated with a large deficit.  Two explanations I see for this:</p>
<p>1.  The responsible reason:  Governments are Keynesian, spending a lot when times are bad, and cut back on spending when times are good (to pay off the debt raised when times are good)<br />2.  The irresponsible reason:  In the short term, a deficit is free money.  After a few years, though, it has to be paid back.  The larger the deficit, the more principal and interest have to be paid back.</p>
<p>I would think option 1 can be dismissed out of hand by anyone with the self-awareness of a stick of gum.  Few administrations have made much of an effort to pay off debt when times are good.  </p>
<p>Over the longer haul (8 years), it seems that running a small deficit or perhaps even a surplus (see year 8!) is correlated with the highest growth.  I would imagine this is especially true if growth can exceed the deficit, and interest rates are low.  </p>
<p>Data<br />Deficit and surplus from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z3.xls">OMB Table 1.3</a><br />Real GDP per capita from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">BEA NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  </p>
<p>Note that because tax and deficit data is for fiscal year, I used real GDP per capita for the third quarter of the calendar year.</p>
<p>As always, if you want my spreadsheet, drop me a line.</p>

<blockquote>Equating adjustments to Social Security&#8217;s benefit schedule with a default on government bonds is a red herring. The government has adjusted Soc Sec&#8217;s benefit schedule repeatedly (for instance, in 1977 and 1983) without this being interpreted as a government default.</p></blockquote>
<p>But no one is saying that.  Well no one outside of the rightwing troll who calls himself Roland Patrick at Andrew’s place and Patrick R. Sullivan at our place.  What Dean, Brad, and I have been complaining about is the abuse of the Trust Fund reserves to bail out the General Fund deficit.  Andrew’s commenter suggests that no one wishes to do that.  Well, I don’t and I suspect Andrew doesn’t.  But George W. Bush does.  </p>
<p>But it’s this comment that leaves me shaking my head:<br />
<blockquote>Finally, it&#8217;s a widely-accepted myth, but a myth nevertheless, that the Greenspan Commission &#8220;deliberately&#8221; tried to pre-fund benefits by building up a big Social Security Trust Fund.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not a myth that payroll contributions were raised.  And assuming the folks on the Greenspan Commission were reasonably intelligent, they had to know that expected payroll contributions would exceed Social Security benefits for the next 35 years or so.  Yes, Alan Greenspan knew that the Trust Fund would accumulate a lot of reserves.  Whether you call this pre-funding or not, the claim made by this commenter lacks credibility unless one assumes that the folks on the Greenspan Commission were stupid.  I prefer not to believe such silliness.  In fact, the commenter continues:<br />
<blockquote>They simply sought a result of 75-year actuarial balance on average, without careful attention to how they got there.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the commenter actually tries to model out what a “75-year actuarial balance on average” means during the life span of the Baby Boomers, he would realize what Brad, Dean, and I have been talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader Bruce Webb insists we review the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/trust/1996/appendices.htm">1996 Trustees Report</a>:<br />
<blockquote>As a result of legislation enacted in 1977 and in 1983, substantial increases in the trust funds were estimated to occur well into the next century, so that the program was partially &#8220;advance funded,&#8221; rather than being funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. Also, because of declines in long-range fertility rates and average real-wage growth that were assumed in the annual reports over the period 1973-87, the annual rate of growth in taxable earnings assumed for the long range became significantly lower than the assumed interest rate. Therefore, during the period 1973-87, the results of the average-cost method and the present-value method began to diverge, and by 1988 they were quite different. While the average-cost method still accounted for most of the effects of the assumed interest rate, it no longer accounted for all of the interest effects. The present-value method, of course, does account for the full effect of the assumed interest rates. So, in 1988, the present-value method of calculating the actuarial balance was resumed. A positive actuarial balance indicates that estimated income is more than sufficient to meet estimated trust fund obligations for the period as a whole. A negative actuarial balance indicates that estimated income is insufficient to meet estimated trust fund obligations for the entire period. An actuarial balance of zero indicates that the estimated income exactly matches estimated trust fund obligations for the period.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure if this were the passages Bruce wants us to read, but I’ll provide a link to their handy <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/trust/1996/figiiib1.html">Figure III.B.1</a>, which forecasts total income (including interest) exceeding outlays through 2018.  And this was the 1996 forecast.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Reader Erisian23 sent me an e-mail linking to <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/news/2007/Government_watchdog_says_control_spending_or_0115.html">comments by David M. Walker, Comptroller General of the United States</a>.  Walker, who runs the GAO, said, &#8220;Continuing on our current fiscal path would gradually erode, if not suddenly damage, our economy, our standard of living, and ultimately even our domestic tranquility and our national security.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, on the subject of how high US tax revenues should be, he responded, &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you an exact number &#8230; but more than 18.2 percent (of GDP), but below 25 percent.&#8221; </p>
<p>Erisian23 notes that 18.2% to 25% is a wide range, and asks whether its possible to narrow that down.  The nickel answer… the size of revenues should depend in part on the size government should be.  When government gets large enough, at the margin, it is less efficient at creating growth than the private sector, and hence cutting back on the size of government is good in the long run.  On the other hand, if government gets small enough, at the margin an extra dollar spent on government services is more efficient at creating growth than the private sector.</p>
<p>So what does growth (in real GDP per capita) look when federal tax receipts are X percent of GDP?  Letting A equal 0 to 17% of GDP, B being 17% to 18% of GDP, C being 18% to 19% of GDP, D being 19% &#8211; 20% of GDP, and E being 20% to 21% of GDP, and using data going back to 1950 (we have not observed federal tax receipts above 21% of GDP in this time):</p>
<p>_________A______B______C_____D______E<br />t to t+1__1.48%__2.72%__1.59%__2.12%__0.98%<br />t to t+2__1.50%__2.58%__1.46%__2.43%__0.91%<br />t to t+3__1.10%__2.46%__1.47%__2.76%__1.23%<br />t to t+4__1.55%__2.42%__1.52%__2.45%__1.50%<br />t to t+5__1.71%__2.38%__1.68%__2.24%__1.66%<br />t to t+6__1.68%__2.34%__1.77%__2.15%__1.60%<br />t to t+7__1.71%__2.29%__1.79%__2.30%__1.68%<br />t to t+8__1.72%__2.30%__1.81%__2.24%__NA</p>
<p>As an example of how to read the table, the annualized growth rate, over a seven year period beginning in a year when tax collections are 18% to 19% of GDP, is 1.79%.</p>
<p>The fastest growth rates, both over the short run and over eight years (I chose not to go longer – after 8 years one is definitely facing a different president’s policies) seem to happen when tax receipts are between 17% and 18% of GDP.  However, 19% to 20% of GDP also looks very good – D beats B in several years.</p>
<p>But… if “too little” is collected, this means deficits.  Does the same apply to deficits, or at least large ones?</p>
<p>The table below looks at the same thing, but only for those years in which there was a surplus, or a deficit of less than 2% of GDP.</p>
<p>_________A______B______C_____D______E<br />t to t+1__1.42%__2.51%__2.25%__1.99%__0.98%<br />t to t+2__1.53%__2.42%__1.96%__1.82%__0.91%<br />t to t+3__0.84%__2.56%__1.92%__2.28%__1.23%<br />t to t+4__1.33%__2.66%__1.84%__1.93%__1.50%<br />t to t+5__1.41%__2.72%__1.89%__1.55%__1.66%<br />t to t+6__1.24%__2.75%__1.86%__1.44%__1.60%<br />t to t+7__1.20%__2.69%__1.78%__1.81%__1.68%<br />t to t+8__1.29%__2.64%__1.71%__1.94%__NA</p>
<p>The benefits of having tax collections fall between 17% and 18% of GDP seem to increase when the country runs a small deficit or a surplus.</p>
<p>And when there is a large deficit?</p>
<p>_________A______B______C_____D______E<br />t to t+1__1.55%__3.01%__1.09%__2.34%__NA<br />t to t+2__1.44%__2.62%__1.08%__3.46%__NA<br />t to t+3__1.88%__2.23%__1.14%__3.56%__NA<br />t to t+4__2.23%__2.12%__1.29%__3.31%__NA<br />t to t+5__2.62%__2.04%__1.53%__3.16%__NA<br />t to t+6__3.00%__1.98%__1.69%__3.09%__NA<br />t to t+7__3.25%__1.93%__1.79%__2.95%__NA<br />t to t+8__3.02%__1.94%__1.89%__2.65%__NA</p>
<p>Column B no longer looks all that great.  It does in the short term, but at periods longer than a year out, it produces lower growth rates than collecting at 19% to 20% of GDP.  </p>
<p>Note an interesting fact…  the lowest tax collections- 0 to 17% of GDP, actually exhibit the fastest growth 7 and 8 years out.  But… I suspect this is an artifact of the data.  Almost half of the observations in which real GDP per capita occurred in the beginning of the Clinton administration, or within 8 years of its beginning.  Since that administration was one of relative fiscal responsibility, it is unlikely that the high growth rates of that era were caused by the previous fiscal irresponsibility.</p>
<p>Conclusion….  The data suggests that the fastest rates of growth have been observed when tax receipts have been between 17% and 18% of GDP, but only if the deficits have been kept small (or there is a surplus) at the same time.  When deficits are large, its better to collect more – closer to 20% of GDP… presumably to pay off the deficit and pay down debt. </p>
<p>Data<br />Tax receipts and deficit or surplus as a percentage of GDP from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z3.xls">OMB Table 1.3</a><br />Real GDP per capita from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">BEA NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  </p>
<p>Note that because tax and deficit data is for fiscal year, I used real GDP per capita for the third quarter of the calendar year.</p>
<p>Administrative notes:<br />1.  As always, my spreadsheets are available upon request, even Thomas Sowell.<br />2.  The cool thing about playing with data is, barring mistakes, one often learns something.  When I started this exercise, I would have bet the data would show the optimal federal tax collection would be in the neighborhood of 20% of GDP and up, assuming no deficit.</p>

                                <p>This post is by reader Edward Charles Ponzi Jr.  He can be reached at “ed” “the” “dci” all as one word, no quotes, at gmail dot com.</p>
<p>While the Chairman&#8217;s Speech had many Angry Bears discussing Social Security finances, one Bear (a Prudent one) was thinking of some different issues altogether. Doug Noland &#8212; economist at Prudent Bear Funds &#8212; publishes a regular feature: &#8220;The Credit Bubble Bulletin&#8221;. The Bernanke speech of Jan 18 was featured in this weeks Bulletin, along with some other Fed-centric comments. With all of Noland&#8217;s Bulletins &#8212; you must scroll down to the LAST SECTION to read his comments &#8212; the beginning is a long list of current data. In this case the last section is: &#8220;Mishkin on Asset Bubbles and Monetary Policy&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Excerpt: &#8220;I hope readers will recognize that we today confront one of the Corrosive Consequences of Inflationism: Complacency and lack of resolve to deal with critical issues.  Confidence in the Fed&#8217;s capacity to cut rates, manipulate market behavior, and &#8220;reflate&#8221;/&#8221;reliquefy&#8221; has never been as unyielding as it today.  If the power of the Fed was not made clear in the early nineties, it was in 1998, 1999, and 2000-2003.  If the banking system needs recapitalized, there&#8217;s no problem.  Hedge fund and Y2K scares, the Fed&#8217;s on the case.  If a collapsing tech Bubble is weighing on growth, simply inflate home prices.  If the corporate bond market suffers from bursting Bubbles, fraud, and problematic risk-aversion, well, just communicate to the marketplace that it&#8217;s the Fed&#8217;s policy to garnish outsized financial profits on the risk-takers and leveraged speculators.  When the debt load – for individuals, businesses, governments, speculators – for the entire nation – becomes too onerous, just inflate system Credit, liquidity, asset prices, incomes, earnings and tax receipts.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I am a Prudent Bear Fund stockholder &#8212; I read his work regularly. I am not sure I have ever seen the issue of Credit Bubbles come up here in Angry Bear Land. We&#8217;re all BEARS aren&#8217;t we?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/17/business/17leonhardt.html?ex=1326690000&#038;en=7f221bfce7a6408c&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">David Leonhardt</a> created an interesting blog discussion by asking what else <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/01/what_else_could.html">$300 million a day</a> could purchase in terms of other forms of government spending.  We could increase other forms of government spending by $100 billion a year, but even this member of the deficit hawk wing of the Democratic party (with all my talk of crowding-out aka the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/michael-mandel-wants-to-ignore-law-of.html">law of scarcity</a>) had to be reminded by Menzie Chinn in <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2007/01/escalation_and_1.html"> Escalation and Accidental Military Keynesianism</a> that I am a Keynesian at least in terms of business cycle analysis.  Menzie provides other analyzes that show often much we are spending at least $100 billion a year on this military misstep.  </p>
<p>But what’s interesting is that Menzie looks at the fiscal policy multipliers per a couple of large econometric models.  Both seem to suggest that the short-term multiplier is near unity but the real GDP impact dissipates over time.  All this makes sense to me as I kept pestering Menzie with crowding-out comments.  But Brad Setser schools this Bear with <br />
<blockquote>no need to worry about crowding out. China is set to finance the &#8220;surge&#8221; with a &#8220;surge&#8221; in its current account surplus &#8230; tho I guess some of that surge may be offset by a slide in the savings surplus in the oil exporters.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Menzie reminds me that the Interlink model is a fixed interest rate model, I went back to my old Principles of Macroeconomic notes (trust me they are old as I have not been in front of a classroom of freshmen in a while – so bear with me).  Let’s consider a simple closed economy model with fixed interest rates where the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) = 0.9, the marginal propensity to tax (t) = 0.3, and the marginal propensity to invest (MPI) = 0.12 so the marginal propensity to spend = MPC(1 – t) + MPI = 0.75, which implies a multiplier that equals  1/(1 – 0.75) = 4.  Could a $100 billion increase in defense spending lead to a $400 billion increase in real GDP?  </p>
<p>Perhaps for a war that began in the second quarter of 2003 when the GDP gap was rather large.  But how large?  Let me begin with a modified version of the Lawrence Kudlow <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow112202.asp">Deficit Dance</a> approach:<br />
<blockquote>As a result, actual economic performance has fallen below the long-term 3.5% historical trend line, which reflects the economy&#8217;s indisputable potential to grow. If that trend line were extended through 2002, as though no slowdown had occurred, then the potential third-quarter gross domestic product would have been $9.829 trillion. Instead, actual GDP fell $364 billion short of the mark. Cumulatively, over the past two years, the loss of potential GDP comes to $1.95 trillion &#8211; a considerable amount.</p></blockquote>
<p>I say modified version as Kudlow’s estimate of the gap (circa $2 trillion a year) confuses summing 6 quarters of annualized flows with the proper averaging of them.  But I take the $9848 billion real GDP figure for 2000QII real GDP (all figures in 2000$) and assume a 3.5% annual growth rate – potential GDP would be $10,919 billion so the GDP gap would be $706 billion since reported real GDP for 2003QII was $10,213 billion.  But this estimate might be too high as 2000QII real GDP may have been beyond full employment and there are reasons why full employment growth may have slowed (such as the anti-supply-side fiscal excesses of the Bush Administration).  Besides – the assumption that the potential GDP grows by 3.5% per year leads to the conclusion that the gap is now $718.  Some might argue that the average real GDP growth for the past six years, which has been around 2.5% per year is a reasonable estimate of the growth rate for potential GDP.  Under this conservative assumption, the GAP was $392 billion.  I prefer, however, to proxy potential GDP by assuming a 3% growth rate.  By this measure, the GAP as of 2003QII was $548 billion, while the gap as of 2006QII was only $371 billion.  Not exactly full employment in 2006 – but perhaps reasonable.  But by any of these proxies, we had a large GDP gap when the Iraq War started.  Of course, a student might ask “wasn’t the 2001 tax cut designed to offset the recession?”  Good question, but I wonder answer – the aggregate demand benefits of this tax cut were less than the White House had predicted perhaps because their aggregate demand policies were poorly designed. </p>
<p>But here’s the problem with this simple multiplier model.  Most large econometric models – such as Interlink – have lower implied fiscal policy multipliers.  If I were teaching a principles class, I would wonder if I should next introduce financial market considerations (aka upward sloping LM curves and the traditional IS-LM crowding-out effect) or some version of open economy macroeconomics.  Brad Setser might suggest a fixed exchange rate (Bretton II) model with the Chinese Central Bank pegging U.S. interest rates.  OK, we then need to add only the marginal propensity to import (MPM) to our definition of the marginal propensity to spend, which now equals MPC(1 – t) + MPI  &#8211; MPM.  If MPM = 0.15, then the marginal propensity to spend is only 0.6 with a multiplier equal to 2.5.  Interlink likely relies on a lower marginal propensity to consume in its estimate that the short-run multiplier is unity.</p>
<p>But what if exchange rates are not pegged and what if the Federal Reserve does not keep interest rates constant in the face of fiscal policy?  On the former, I have tended to argue that fiscal stimulus would likely lead to dollar appreciation, which would crowd out net exports.  The argument assumed that the fiscal stimulus would lead to higher interest rates.  The Price-adjusted Broad Dollar Index had increased from around 100 in early 2000 to almost 113 during the first quarter of 2002, but this appreciation was short lived.  By late 2003, the index had declined to 100 where it stayed through the third quarter of 2004.  </p>

<p>Part of the explanation of why the dollar was not stronger may have been monetary policy, which drove interest rates down.  Our graph shows the 10-year TIPS showing that real interest rates fell from over 4% in the late 1990’s to less than 1% by the end of 2003.  Real interest rates remained below 1% through mid-2005.  But as the economy has appeared to move closer to full employment, the Federal Reserve has moved towards a tighter monetary policy with real interest rates rising to around 3%.  And yet, the dollar has continued to devalue.  Mercifully, we have not yet seen extensive crowding-out from this reversal in monetary policy.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Here&#8217;s an article about <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/weekend/lostluggage_1.html">airlines losing passengers&#8217; luggage</a>.  I was wondering where permanently lost luggage goes.  In theory, presumably, it stays somewhere under the control of an airline.  After all, if you go to San Francisco but your is mistakenly placed on a flight to Tokyo, eventually, after going around on the little carousel enough times, some airline employee will pull it aside.  But if that were true, it should be possible, except in the rare instances where somehow all identifying information were to disappear both from the exterior and interior of the luggage, to reunite the luggage with its owner.  And yet, a lot of luggage seems to disappear forever.</p>
<p>Which means that lost luggage must, at some point, leave the airlines&#8217; custody.  But how?  Some thoughts:</p>
<p>1.  From what I can tell, most US airports don&#8217;t check that the person leaving with luggage is the owner of the luggage.  With no practical deterrent to theft, thieves will proliferate.  I wonder if thieves specialize in luggage that goes around the carousel many times, and thus appears unclaimed?  In other words&#8230; thieves may actually save the airlines from the hassle of getting the luggage back where it belongs (albeit at a cost &#8211; some small token of compensation for the loss of the luggage).  Would this explain why US airports don&#8217;t check baggage tags?</p>
<p>2.  Within the airlines, some employees engage in theft, and its not worth the time or effort for the airlines to ferret out that theft.</p>
<p>3.  When airlines choose not to reunite luggage with its owner, presumably they dispose of the luggage.  Perhaps receipts from this method of disposal (auction perhaps?) exceed the greater of the cost of compensating passengers and the cost of reuniting the luggage.</p>
<p>I would guess someone somewhere has worked all this out.  And that someone works for an airline.</p>

                                <p>AB readers may have been surprised that I suggested I have respect for the <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/01/some-clarifications.html">Andrew Samwick</a> view, which he has clarified:<br />
<blockquote>I don&#8217;t favor default on securities issued by the federal government. I didn&#8217;t bring this up &#8211; it shouldn&#8217;t even be a question. But Social Security is not a security issued by the federal government. It is a program that current generations legislate on their own behalf and largely at future generations&#8217; expense. It is not the only such program. I think all such programs need to be carefully considered, and in particular, that we should tread very lightly on future generations&#8217; income when the proceeds go for our own consumption, not for investments that increase the size of the economy they will inherit. That attitude applies to Social Security, to Medicare, and to the level of federal debt &#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t characterize anything I&#8217;ve suggested at any point as a default on Social Security. I do want to scale the program back to what can be afforded in the long term (as I have defined both &#8220;afforded&#8221; and &#8220;long term&#8221;) with roughly the same payroll tax rate on future generations as we&#8217;ve paid.</p></blockquote>
<p>The formulation of the issues provided by <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/01/what_kinds_of_s.html">Brad DeLong</a> once again proves invaluable:<br />
<blockquote>It depends on what kind of Social Security reform we are talking about. There&#8217;s one reform in which benefits are cut and taxes are raised but the equality:</p>
<p>(Current Value of Trust Fund) + (Present Value of Future Social Security Taxes) = (Present Value of Future Social Security Benefits)</p>
<p>is preserved. That&#8217;s not a default.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another reform in which the principal purpose is to open up a gap between the left hand side and the right hand side and make:</p>
<p>(Current Value of Trust Fund) + (Present Value of Future Social Security Taxes) > (Present Value of Future Social Security Benefits)</p>
<p>That is tantamount to default.</p>
<p>Most proposals for Social Security reform that start out with statements like &#8220;The Social Security Trust Fund doesn&#8217;t really exist&#8221; are proposals of the second kind.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean, Brad, and I would object to the second form of “reform”, which I’ll discuss in a moment.  Isn’t Andrew putting forth the first form? In other words, is he suggesting a form of privatization that lowers the payroll tax rate, which of course would require policymakers to lower the Present Value of Future Social Security Benefits such that the equality hold.  If so, we cannot accuse this proposal of what I’ve called the backdoor employment tax increase.</p>
<p>But as Andrew has explained, policy makers have managed the rest of the Federal government such that the expected value of future income taxes cannot cover Federal debt plus the present value of expected future Federal spending outside of the Social Security program.  This is the fiscal crisis that Ben Bernanke testified to – as did Alan Greenspan when he was Federal Reserve chairman.</p>
<p>So how does President Bush intend to address this general fund fiasco?  Certainly not an increase in income taxes.  Certainly not a reduction in defense spending.  Certainly not a repeal of that expensive prescription drug benefit that he brags about in the same speeches where he brags that his tax cuts have given us our money back.  This kind of pandering and dishonesty is not the fault of Andrew Samwick or Ben Bernanke.  And it’s this kind of dishonesty that leads me to believe that President Bush is advocating what Brad called the second form of “reform”.  Dean Baker calls this default and some uber-technical types object to his term.  Fine – let me call it grand larceny.  If implemented, it would be a backdoor employment tax increase.  Now if President Bush and his minions want to balance the budget by raising employment taxes, might we simply ask that they be honest about it?  But then one could argue my suggestion is silly – after all, how many thieves call the bank before they come over and clean out the vault?</p>
<p>I am not in favor of complete privatization as workers likely do want some form of defined benefits retirement plan.  Mark Thoma has been excellent in discussing this aspect of the debate.  Of course, one can reasonably ask whether we need as much longevity insurance as the Social Security program offers.  Andrew and I might have a difference of opinion on this issue.  But as I read Andrew’s many excellent discussions on this, he is not advocating an implicit backdoor employment and nor am I.  Let’s be honest – President Bush and his minions are pushing for a backdoor employment tax increase.  But let’s also be fair to Andrew – he is NOT one of Bush’s minions.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/01/what_promises_h.html">Brad DeLong</a> also enjoyed what Andrew Samwick had to say and adds this background:<br />
<blockquote>In the early 1980s, acting on the advice of the Greenspan Commission, President Reagan and the congress began &#8220;prefunding&#8221; Social Security&#8211;having the Social Security system run a surplus in the years from 1983 to 2017 or so in order for it to run a deficit later on. Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and the congresses of the 1980s and early 1990s (and George W. Bush and his congresses of 2001-2006) used this Social Security surplus as an excuse for not dealing with their enormous general-fund deficits: taxes were lower and spending was higher than if they had lived up to their responsibilities or not had the Social Security operating surplus to draw on.  What does this history entail for future fiscal policy, both as a matter of honor and a matter of prudence? Andrew Samwick tries to think through these issues, and gives his take. He says smart things</p></blockquote>
<p>The only thing left to say is that George W. Bush created the latest round of enormous general fund deficits.  We shall all remember this the next time George W. Bush cynically claims he wants to reform Social Security.</p>

                                <p>I was peeking over at the Corner to see if the National Review nitwits had commented on Bernanke’s testimony – and they did not disappoint.  <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NjlkNTgzNWIzNzZhZjE5NzdlMmRkNDIyOTlkODIxMjY">Lawrence Kudlow</a> starts off with some babbling about growth and personal accounts. <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjQ1MWJjN2FhZDhmMWNkODA0NWExZThkODcyNDY4YjE=">Ramesh Ponnuru</a> tries his best to reign in Kudlow’s babbling:<br />
<blockquote>Larry, I&#8217;m all for higher growth. But Bernanke did address that question: &#8220;To some extent, strong economic growth can help to mitigate budgetary pressures, and all else being equal, fiscal policies that are supportive of growth would be beneficial. Unfortunately, economic growth alone is unlikely to solve the nation&#8217;s impending fiscal problems. Economic growth leads to higher wages and profits and thus increases tax receipts, but higher wages also imply increased Social Security benefits, as those benefits are tied to wages.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While Ponnuru’s quotes the relevant passage from Bernanke’s testimony, he makes the mistake of thinking Kudlow understands simple English.  Check out <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZGJkYTUzZGU2ZTk0MzkzZDgwZTFiMmI1ZTIzMmExYjk=">this reply</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Does growth solve Social Security? Bernanke says it won’t. But the S.S. Trustee reports on the difference between 2 percent and 3 percent growth show otherwise.  That’s the key point. And part of that key point is the productivity element. Good growth and capital formation will keep productivity strong. And that is what’s really driving the Trustees’ optimistic model that shows no bankruptcy.</p></blockquote>
<p>What part of  “economic growth can help to mitigate budgetary pressures” does Kudlow not understand?  OK, higher growth might give us the Trustees’ optimistic model (the Bush crowd is likely really ticked at Kudlow for agreeing with Dean Baker) but someone tell Kudlow that Bernanke and Ponnuru were talking about the overall Federal budget.  And the General Fund deficit is not going to be eliminated by 3% long-term growth. </p>
<p>Nice try Ramesh, but it’s hard to educate a fool who refuses to listen.</p>

                                <p>I am back after baking in the sun in <country-region><place>Nicaragua</place></country-region> for a couple of weeks doing absolutely nothing at all but swing in a hammock staring at the ocean.  Not even internet access for the most part which is a good thing to do every now and then for those of us who are addicted to it.  Also a good break from the surface-of-Pluto conditions I found in upstate NY when I got back.  But what I also found was that Tom Friedman, who usually drives me crazy with his ability to believe his own nonsense even when it flies in the face of numerous facts, said something good.  Admittedly, it was buried in the middle of an otherwise silly column of the Iraq-would-be-a-huge-success-if-only-my-fantasy-were-reality genre.  On January 12 (sorry, it’s behind the subscription wall) he said</p>
<p>“You need to tell Iraqis that by calling for a surge in troops you&#8217;re giving them one last chance to reconcile, otherwise we&#8217;re gone by Dec. 1. And you need to tell Americans that you&#8217;re creating a $45-a-barrel floor price for imported oil, so investors can safely finance alternatives without worrying that they&#8217;ll be undercut by OPEC.”</p>
<p>The first part I won’t even try to comment on apart from saying I would be happy if we were gone by December 12.  Tom seems to be unable to believe that the situation in <country-region><place>Iraq</place></country-region> really is beyond our power to fix.  The second part, however, is a great idea.  Not one that Tom Friedman thought of but a good idea nevertheless.  There have been numerous proposals from economists for decades to raise the price of oil so that it reflects societal costs.  But at this particular point in time it is perhaps more obvious than ever just what those costs include.  Ask yourself this – How big a pigovian tax would be needed to account for the following costs of our unrestrained consumption of imported oil?</p>
<p>&#8211;  the <country-region><place>Iraq</place></country-region> War. Even lowball estimates put this at $2 billion a week.  And though we have had numerous excuses, does anyone really think we would be there if they had no oil?</p>
<p>&#8211;  2 <country-region><place>US</place></country-region> deaths/day  (Though far higher on some days such as today at 21)</p>
<p>&#8211;  pollution</p>
<p>&#8211; global warming</p>
<p>This is a very incomplete list but the basic lesson remains.  We are already paying a very high price per gallon of gas.  We just aren’t paying all of it at the gas station.  As a result we are stuck in a situation where it doesn’t pay to invest in alternative technologies since there is no way to know that they won’t be undercut if the price of oil takes a dip in the near future.</p>
<p>This dip is in fact more likely than not.  When the price of oil spiked recently a lot of investment went into developing oil sources that were previously uneconomic.  When these come on line the current situation of tight supply will be gone.  If it is coupled with a recession then lower prices are likely for a while even though the long run outlook remains one of higher prices.  If investors in alternative energy technologies had some confidence that they would not be affected by such short run dips then they would be much quicker to put money into them.  We should all be in favor of this.</p>
<p>(A note.  Hydrogen is NOT an alternative energy source.  It is an alternative intermediate form for transporting energy in, e.g. cars.  Why?  Because you need to use energy – usually electricity – to make the hydrogen in the first place.  This means that hydrogen, though clean burning at point of end use, is really just another way of using electricity which is produced by all of the same old sources we have had for a long time – coal, oil, nuclear, hydro, etc.  A truly alternative source would be one which did not rely on these fuels to produce the electricity, e.g. wind or solar)</p>
