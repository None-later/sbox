                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/economonitor/173770">Felix Salmon</a> objects to something Dean Baker said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s agree, for the sake of argument at least, that the social security trust fund exists, chock-full of government bonds. Like any trust fund, its trustees have control over what it pays out and when. If the trust fund reduces the amount it pays out, or only pays out later than currently mandated, that&#8217;s a change in the trust fund. It is not a bond default. Insofar as the bonds in the trust fund exist, they will continue to receive their coupon and principal payments. It&#8217;s what the trust fund does with those payments that&#8217;s being debated.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2007/01/bernanke_and_th.html">James Hamilton</a> agrees:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would suggest first that the word &#8220;default&#8221; is completely inappropriate for this discussion. The term &#8220;default&#8221; has a very clear and very narrow legal meaning, used to refer to a situation in which one has promised to make a specific identified dollar payment to a specific individual at a specific date, and the payment is not made.</p></blockquote>
<p>But there’s an ambiguity at play that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/01/what_kinds_of_s.html">Brad DeLong</a> clarifies:</p>
<blockquote><p>It depends on what kind of Social Security reform we are talking about. There&#8217;s one reform in which benefits are cut and taxes are raised but the equality:</p>
<p>(Current Value of Trust Fund) + (Present Value of Future Social Security Taxes) = (Present Value of Future Social Security Benefits)<br />is preserved. That&#8217;s not a default.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another reform in which the principal purpose is to open up a gap between the left hand side and the right hand side and make:</p>
<p>(Current Value of Trust Fund) + (Present Value of Future Social Security Taxes) > (Present Value of Future Social Security Benefits)<br />That is tantamount to default.</p>
<p>Most proposals for Social Security reform that start out with statements like &#8220;The Social Security Trust Fund doesn&#8217;t really exist&#8221; are proposals of the second kind.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad, Dean, and I have all said we’d be in favor of the first kind of reform. Andrew Samwick is also a member of this coalition.  I think most of us would recognize that the suggestions made by James Hamilton could be part of the first type of reform.  </p>
<p>But let’s be honest – the Bush Administration has no serious proposals of reducing the massive General Fund deficit, which is why they allude to the second type of “reform”.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/01/chairman-ben-and-long-term-budget.html">Andrew Samwick</a> weighs in on this debate – and provides links to several of his previous contributions.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/19/mondale.cheney.ap/index.html">AP</a> follows Walter Mondale who had the courage in 1984 to tell us taxes would have to be increased.  Jimmy Carter’s former Vice President is not happy with George W. Bush’s Vice President: Dick “Deficits Don’t Matter” Cheney:<br />
<blockquote>Vice President Dick Cheney has bullied federal agencies and given absurd advice about the nation&#8217;s risk and Iraq, Walter Mondale said Friday … Mondale, who served under Carter, said Cheney and his assistants pressured federal agencies as they prepared information for President Bush.  &#8220;I think Cheney&#8217;s been at the center of cooking up farcical estimates of national risks, weapons of mass destruction and the 9/11 connection to Iraq,&#8221; he said. That does not serve the president, because he needs facts, Mondale said. &#8220;If I had done as vice president what this vice president has done, Carter would have thrown me out of there,&#8221; Mondale said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think he could have tolerated a vice president over there pressuring and pushing other agencies, ordering up different reports than they wanted to send us. I don&#8217;t think he would have stood for it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So did “Dead Eye” Dick step up and defend himself personally.  Oh no, he hides behind the skirts of Lea Anne McBride, a spokeswoman for Cheney:<br />
<blockquote>Twice elected to serve with President Bush, the vice president is committed to protecting Americans from those who wish to do us harm.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the best Ms. McBride had to offer?  Cheney is truly a coward when he has to hide behind the skirts of someone with so little to say.  I’m not quite sure why Walter Mondale chose today to go off on this White House.  It’s not that this was way over due – but plainly to speaking Walter Mondale: what took you so long?</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://hardblogger.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/01/19/36730.aspx">David Shuster</a> watches the jury selection process in the Scooter Libby trial as to whether he committed perjury and obstruction of justice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vice President Cheney’s testimony and role in the CIA leak investigation is going to be far more intriguing than previously thought.  There were two clues yesterday.  (1)  A Libby lawyer, for the second time in this process, asked a potential juror how they will view Vice President Cheney if his testimony is “contradicted” by another witness.  (2)  Late yesterday, Patrick Fitzgerald asked a juror who expressed admiration for the office of the vice president whether that potential juror would have any problems if counsel (Fitzgerald) conducted an aggressive cross examination of the vice president?</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, will the jurors watch the Vice President and think to themselves – is this jerk lying under oath just like he lies in every other venue of public life?  Yes – the Libby perjury trial may turn on whether the Vice President is a serial liar.  OK, I can’t serve as I have made up my mind on this score years ago.</p>

                                <p>AB reader Oldvet points us to more Social Security stupidity, this time from <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&#038;sid=a_46QcGbvFZk">Scott Lanman and Craig Torres</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the U.S. government may face a &#8220;fiscal crisis&#8221; in the coming decades if it fails to deal with the rising costs of retirement and medical benefits for the aging population &#8230; The White House Office of Management and Budget projected in July that the budget deficit would be $339 billion this fiscal year, up from $248 billion last year. The OMB estimated that the deficit would narrow to $188 billion in 2008. Bush entered office in 2001 with a budget surplus of $127 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah yes, the unified deficit thing again.  As in “what Social Security surplus”?  I guess Lanman and Torres will say – we were just reporting on Bernanke’s testimony.  </p>
<p>Further down, they note:<br />
<blockquote>Under Congressional Budget Office projections, the ratio of federal debt held by the public to gross domestic product will rise to about 100 percent in 2030 and &#8220;grow exponentially after that,&#8221; from about 37 percent now, Bernanke said. &#8220;Ultimately, this expansion of debt would spark a fiscal crisis, which could be addressed only by very sharp spending cuts or tax increases, or both,&#8221; Bernanke said in the testimony.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm.  Total Federal debt is closing in on 70% of GDP already.  But public debt is only 37% of GDP.   It’s like magic when one can ignore those Trust Fund reserves!  </p>
<p>But Chairman Ben is correct about “a fiscal crisis, which could be addressed only by very sharp spending cuts or tax increases”.  So Mr. and Mrs. America (OK, that’s Dick Armey’s line) – what should it be?  Should you just turn over part of your future Social Security checks as you kids continue to pay high payroll taxes?  Or should we raise income tax rates so the very rich have to share some of the future burden?</p>

<blockquote>There’s something happening here, and what it is seems completely clear: the Bush administration is trying to protect itself by purging independent-minded prosecutors &#8230;  Since the day [this administration] took power&#8230; ethical problems and conflicts of interest have been the rule, not the exception. For a long time the administration nonetheless seemed untouchable, protected both by Republican control of Congress and by its ability to justify anything and everything as necessary for the war on terror. Now, however, the investigations are closing in on the Oval Office. The latest news is that J. Steven Griles, the former deputy secretary of the Interior Department and the poster child for the administration’s systematic policy of putting foxes in charge of henhouses, is finally facing possible indictment. And the purge of U.S. attorneys looks like a pre-emptive strike against the gathering forces of justice. Won’t the administration have trouble getting its new appointees confirmed by the Senate? Well, it turns out that it won’t have to.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s return to October of 1973 with a story from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/102173-2.htm">Carroll Kilpatrick</a> (back in the days when the Washington Post was worth reading):<br />
<blockquote>In the most traumatic government upheaval of the Watergate crisis, President Nixon yesterday discharged Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox and accepted the resignations of Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William D. Ruckelshaus. The President also abolished the office of the special prosecutor and turned over to the Justice Department the entire responsibility for further investigation and prosecution of suspects and defendants in Watergate and related cases. Shortly after the White House announcement, FBI agents sealed off the offices of Richardson and Ruckelshaus in the Justice Department and at Cox&#8217;s headquarters in an office building on K Street NW.  An FBI spokesman said the agents moved in &#8220;at the request of the White House.&#8221; Agents told staff members in Cox&#8217;s office they would be allowed to take out only personal papers. A Justice Department official said the FBI agents and building guards at Richardson&#8217;s and Ruckelshaus&#8217; offices were there &#8220;to be sure that nothing was taken out.&#8221; Richardson resigned when Mr. Nixon instructed him to fire Cox and Richardson refused. When the President then asked Ruckelshaus to dismiss Cox, he refused, White House spokesman Ronald L. Ziegler said, and he was fired. Ruckelshaus said he resigned. Finally, the President turned to Solicitor General Robert H. Bork, who by law becomes acting Attorney General when the Attorney General and deputy attorney general are absent, and he carried out the President&#8217;s order to fire Cox. The letter from the President to Bork also said Ruckelshaus resigned. These dramatic developments were announced at the White House at 8:25 p.m. after Cox had refused to accept or comply with the terms of an agreement worked out by the President and the Senate Watergate committee under which summarized material from the White House Watergate tapes would be turned over to Cox and the Senate committee. In announcing the plan Friday night, the President ordered Cox to make no further effort to obtain tapes or other presidential documents. Cox responded that he could not comply with the President&#8217;s instructions and elaborated on his refusal and vowed to pursue the tape recordings at a televised news conference yesterday. That set in motion the chain of events that resulted in the departure of Cox and the two top officials of the Justice Department and immediately raised prospects that the President himself might be impeached or forced to resign. In a statement last night, Cox said: &#8220;Whether ours shall continue to be a government of laws and not of men is now for Congress and ultimately the American people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect George W. Bush will need several folks who – like Robert Bork did back in 1973 – will sacrifice integrity to do the bidding of the would be emperor.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Yesterday I had a post on the Iraq war which I ended with the following sentence:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that Maliki is trustworthy either, but its hard to understand how GW can&#8217;t step back and realize he&#8217;s done more to help Bin Laden&#8217;s cause than even Bin Laden.&#8221;</p>
<p>A reader questioned this.  I placed a response in comments&#8230; But it occurs to me that to many people its not obvious that GW is actually helping Bin Laden&#8217;s cause, albeit inadvertently.  So I&#8217;m going to quote myself&#8230;</p>
<p>Bin Laden talks a lot of about a holy war between Sunni and Shia. Pay any attention to what the folks in Egypt and Saudi Arabia have been saying about the Shia lately? It used to be that the Saudis were content to persecute their own Shia minority (15% of the population), but now that they&#8217;re engaged in a proxy war with the Iranians (and both the Iranians and the Saudis are in a proxy war with the US, except for the US there&#8217;s no proxy about it), they&#8217;re starting to up it a notch. I&#8217;m not exactly sure what&#8217;s with the Egyptians&#8230; I don&#8217;t pay enough attention, but Mubarak apparently has actually used the word Shia in speeches a few times lately.</p>
<p>So&#8230; <br />1. Bin Laden wants a Sunni v. Shia holy war<br />2. There&#8217;s been an armed truce between Sunni and Shia for a couple of hundred years now<br />3. Since sometime in 2003, there&#8217;s been a fight between Sunni and Shia in Iraq, which has degenerated into a proxy war between the wealthiest Sunni country and the biggest Shia country</p>
<p>Since the proxy war would not have happened without the invasion of Iraq (despite Osama&#8217;s best efforts), the region would still be at the armed truce stage. Conclusion&#8230; GW has &#8220;done more to help Bin Laden&#8217;s cause than even Bin Laden&#8221; (to quote myself).</p>

                                <p>This post is by Angry Bear reader erisian23:  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m still working out my thinking on wage floors so this is not offered in the spirit of a final answer, merely a snapshot of where I&#8217;m currently at. In the interests of keeping this relatively concise, I&#8217;m necessarily glossing over many important but non-core details. It&#8217;s a complicated problem set, to say the least.</p>
<p>A Low-Cal Economic View</p>
<p>A guaranteed minimum wage acts like a tax upon the creation and maintenance of minimum wage jobs. We know that what we tax, we discourage. The lower the fair market value of the labor relative to $7.25, the steeper the effective tax becomes and presumably the more drastic the impact on that market. We are in effect actively suppressing the creation of the market-determined optimal number of these types of jobs. That also means reducing the options available to those who would take these jobs. These are people who, if anything, need more, not fewer options.</p>
<p>If we decide that low wage jobs are undesirable for whatever reason, we might be willing to leave people unemployed vs. encouraging the creation of additional low-end jobs. However the American dream of achieving prosperity by moving upward and onwards is balanced against a number of realities, for example: (1) some people today who have climbed the ladder quite proficiently started out on the lowest rung and (2) some will find the limits of their aptitude, current skills (language, education, craftsmanship, etc), personal motivation, or other factors leave them in low wage positions indefinitely.</p>
<p>For whatever reason someone is working at a low paying job, I take it as a given that their gainful employment is preferable to their unemployment. I also assume that the creation of additional similar jobs represents increasing demand for their particular type of labor and should ultimately benefit them over time in areas like working conditions or job benefits, even if not a natural wage at or above $7.25/hr. Based on this it stands to reason that, all else being equal, more low wage jobs are preferable to fewer. If â€œany job is better than no job, we ought to encourage demand and competition in both entry level and dead-end labor markets to the benefit of all concerned. We certainly should not be placing a special tax solely on the creators of these jobs.</p>
<p>In the Name of Justice</p>
<p>Bizarrely, taxing purchasers of low-wage labor is precisely how we attempt to achieve our socially just aim. As a result, both the purchasers and suppliers of low-wage labor suffer, one through artificially increased costs and the other through artificially decreased demand for their labor. Adding insult to injury, the minimum wage and its increases do not share their negative impacts on the market for accountants, attorneys, software engineers, etc. It is, for example, Johnson &#038; Sons Landscaping, its employees, and its customers who will pick up the tab for society&#8217;s largesse while my household income and Deloitte &#038; Touche&#8217;s profit margins and job listings are likely to be relatively immunized.</p>
<p>As proponents of social justice, it&#8217;s difficult to argue that this is a socially or economically fair arrangement. Society may for example strongly believe that charities who serve food to the needy represent a noble cause. This hardly compels us to conclude that businesses in the food service industry, and only they, must donate 10% of their revenues to the charities we prefer.</p>
<p>If society-at-large wishes to purchase the psychic and social benefits of a guaranteed standard of living for all workers, what reason do we have for shifting the costs of our kindness onto others? The desire to hire low valued labor does not inherently imply an obligation to sustain that person in a manner society determines is suitable. It is society that is imposing this requirement for a minimum guaranteed standard of living and so it should be society that pays for it. It&#8217;s easy to be generous with other people&#8217;s money. We don&#8217;t discover our true values and priorities until we pay the costs ourselves.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to put my money where my mouth is. Let the ditch diggers wage in Seattle sink to $4.50/hr. Let the cost of a cashier to a grocer in Kansas fall to $3.25/hr. If guaranteeing them a better standard of living then means raising my taxes, do it. I am willing to pay my fair share to support my beliefs because ultimately it&#8217;s the degree to which society is willing to assume these costs that we can arrive at the real market value of having a guaranteed minimum standard of living in the first place.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Regular AB readers know I often link to the blog of <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/01/the_social_security_trust_fund.html#015167">Dean Baker</a>.  Dean has said something I often try to get across, but he is so eloquent here that we just give him the microphone: <br />
<blockquote>Since the “entitlement” cutters seem to be on the warpath again, it might be time for another sermon on the Social Security trust fund. This one really should not be hard, but I am afraid that that there are many powerful people with a vested interest in creating confusion, and they have succeeded. </p>
<p>In 1983, Congress (following the recommendation of the Greenspan commission) deliberately raised the Social Security tax far above the level needed to pay current Social Security benefits. This led to a large surplus. Under the law, this surplus must be used to buy U.S. government bonds. Also, under the law, the bonds held by Social Security are liabilities of the federal government, just like any other bonds. When the program needs the money from the bonds to pay benefits, it can rely on the interest and eventually the principle from these bonds, just like any private pension or individual. </p>
<p>Note, that there was never any rule that any Social Security only gets government bonds if the government runs a surplus. In other words, from the standpoint of Social Security, it matters not an iota that the government has mostly run deficits for the last quarter century. This may have been bad policy, but it doesn’t affect the size of the trust fund. </p>
<p>The most recent projections from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office show that Social Security will have enough money between projected taxes and the bonds in the trust fund to pay all benefits through the year 2046, with no changes whatsoever.<br />This is very important to understand when someone like Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke proposes cuts to Social Security. Workers have already paid for these benefits. The Social Security tax is very regressive. Its regressivity can be justified by the progressive payback structure of the program. However, if the benefits are cut, at appoint when the program can still easily afford the benefits (e.g. 10-20 years), then the government has effectively stolen from the people who paid Social Security taxes. </p>
<p>There are many people who want to do this – effectively default on the government bonds held by the Social Security trust fund. If this default is now on the national agenda, then it certainly seems reasonable for the workers who are losing their benefits to raise the prospect of defaulting on government bonds more generally. After all, what can possibly be the rationale of only defaulting on the government bonds held by workers through the Social Security trust fund, but not defaulting on the government bonds held by the wealthy people who think this is such a good idea?</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Do the editors of the National Review have any commonsense?  OK, they don’t want the oil companies to lose their special privileges gained over the last several years of lobbying efforts – but why would the National Review be so stupid to put up <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDk1MDFiYjY5MDg1ZjZkYzU0M2M2ODczZDkzMzFkZjc=">Grover Norquist</a> to make the case:</p>
<blockquote><p>The “Clean Energy Act of 2007” would raise taxes on both domestic oil producers and American consumers … Claiming that “Big Oil” owes $6 billion in royalty fees for production in federal waters, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has implied that oil companies got away with murder after Hurricane Katrina sent oil prices skyrocketing past $70 a barrel. In a Wall Street Journal editorial Tuesday, however, the exact nature of the leases that allowed for that production was revealed. The leases, signed by the Clinton administration’s Interior Department in 1998, made no stipulation about royalty payments. Even after the lessees inquired about the lack of royalty payments, the Interior Department signed the contracts anyway. Nonetheless, the new Democratic majority intends to violate binding contracts, forcing domestic producers to accept a $9 per barrel royalty fee from the leases. If they do not except, they lose the right to bid for federal property in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some on the right are confusing uber-technical legal arguments with the economics of demand and supply.  Whether or not some contract administrator screwed up big time during Clinton’s second term, Norquist is advocating letting oil companies to use government resources free of charge.  This is a subsidy and I would suspect that the incidence of this subsidy accrues to the supplier not the consumer.  But I’m assuming an inelastic supply curve.  Norquist wishes to scare us by saying the incidence of removing this subsidy accrues to the consumer.  OK Grover – what are your estimates of the elasticities of demand and supply?</p>

<blockquote>Since the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects that Social Security can pay all future benefits for the next 39 years, with no changes whatsoever, this definitely gives new meaning to the word &#8220;looming&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;insolvency.&#8221; The real headline for this article should have been that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is apparently suggesting that the federal government default on some of the government bonds held by the Social Security trust fund. That would seem to be the implication of his suggestion that we restructure Social Security and presumably not pay the full benefits mandated under current law.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/01/bernanke_entitl_1.html">Mark Thoma</a> gently suggests the following rewrite of Chairman Ben’s speech:<br />
<blockquote>The Social Security and Medicare problems are not of the same order of magnitude. Draw a sharper distinction and make it clear that Medicare is far and away the biggest worry.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Mark is being very kind to Chairman Ben, one of his readers (billy) directs us to <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/173156">Brad Setser</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Social Security’s revenues exceed its expenditures – and will continue to do so for several years.  Its financial assets are growing – they will top $2 trillion at the end of this year.   Sure, it will need to draw on the interest on those assets in about ten year &#8211; and a few after that, it will need to tap the principal as well.  But wasn&#8217;t that the point of building up the Social Security system’s assets?  Consequently, I don’t see why 2017 is a date that causes the social security system any trouble &#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>Brad later notes in the comments:<br />
<blockquote>One part of the federal government (soc sec) set aside $10 out of its current revenue. Another part (the rest of the gov) spent $10 more than it took it. The rest of the government promised to repay social security with interest &#8230;   at some point this will simply be reversed. the rest of the government will pay Social security $10 back plus interest (or borrow the funds needed to repay social security from the private market).  The social security surplus that finances a deficit elsewhere in the government will turn into a social security deficit financed by a surplus elsewhere (or my external borrowing). Why does the internal accounting matter? Simple &#8211; different parts of the government have different revenue sources. Social security is financed by a flat payroll tax up to a cap. That&#8217;s regressive (Soc sec benefits/ insurance is, by contrast, progressive). The rest of the gov. is financed by a progressive income tax.  The increase in the regressive payroll tax to build up the trust fund (keeping the progressive income tax or the deficit lower than it otherwise would have been) only makes sense in my view if the progressive income tax is used to collect the revenue needed to pay the social security system back.  Otherwise, as Dean Baker likes to point out, all those folks who paid more soc sec payroll taxes that needed to cover current soc sec benefits will have gotten royally screwed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Workers should realize by now that this President is hell bent to royally screw them.  But why is the Federal Reserve Chairman offering this Greenspan like doublespeak.  The problem is not the Social Security benefits.  The problem started when President Bush unleashed a massive General Fund deficit with the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.</p>

<blockquote>Economists had taught me that the trade deficit is not a big deal. (The budget deficit may be a big one, but that&#8217;s a different issue.) But with all the pundits and politicians alarmed, I began to wonder if I was out of touch. Then I thought about my local supermarket. I buy stuff from the Food Emporium every week. I spend thousands of dollars a year there. But the supermarket never buys anything from me. Not one thing &#8230; Trade statistics obscure reality. Individuals exchange only when each expects to benefit. If they didn&#8217;t expect it, they wouldn&#8217;t trade. That&#8217;s true even if one party is American and the other Chinese. Trade is trade. If we don&#8217;t care about trade balances at the individual level, why does it matter if in a given year Americans as a group buy more from the Chinese than they buy from us? It doesn&#8217;t. In fact, it&#8217;s a good thing. Foreigners trade cool products (and capital goods) for paper money. They can do only three things with our dollars: buy American goods and services, save them, or invest in the United States (including buying U.S. government debt). In other words, most of what foreigners don&#8217;t spend here, they invest here. The trade deficit is mirrored by the capital-account surplus . Should we be concerned that foreigners see the U.S. economy as a good place to invest their money? I can&#8217;t see why. I think we should see it as a wonderful thing: They trust America&#8217;s future enough to invest in it. Investment creates new products and better jobs. Especially absurd is Dobbs&#8217;s idea that the trade deficit means we are in debt to foreigners. Except for the T-bills foreigners buy, this just isn&#8217;t true.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why would Dr. Mankiw want anyone to read this nonsense?  To the degree that Stossel is saying don’t listen to trade protectionist such as Lou Dobbs and Pat Buchanan – great!  And his grocery store analogy is essentially saying that bilateral trade balances are rather meaningless.  If the U.S. had a trade surplus with Europe equal to its trade deficit with Asia, I’d see his point.  But we seem to have a trade deficit with almost every nation.  </p>
<p>Stossel argues we should be concerned with government deficits but we should not be concerned when the Chinese are buying investment goods from U.S. producers.  But might someone inform Mr. Stossel of the facts.  Investment demand in the U.S. is not high.  No, we have a very low national savings rate.  And the Chinese are buying U.S. government bonds.  Stossel wants to pretend that we are not running up debt.  He wants to pretend that the U.S. is creating all sorts of new net wealth.  If Stossel really believes what he wrote, then is very ignorant of the data.  Greg Mankiw is not – so why did he asked us to read Stossel?</p>
