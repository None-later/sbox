                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In comments to my (admittedly simplistic) posts on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/optimal-amount-of-tax-collection.html">optimal tax collections</a> and the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/optimal-size-of-deficit.html">optimal size of the deficit</a>, the issue of interest on the debt came up.  </p>
<p>So I pulled data for interest (sadly, the OMB only seems to keep it going back to 1962 – so the results are not strictly comparable to the two other posts, for which data went back to 1950), and ran the same analysis.  So how do interest payments on the debt affect growth in real GDP per capita?</p>
<p>________1% to 2%___2% to 3%__3% to 4%____4% +<br />t to t+1____2.71%____2.13%____1.71%____2.14%<br />t to t+2____2.56%____1.91%____2.19%____2.11%<br />t to t+3____2.50%____1.81%____2.38%____2.04%<br />t to t+4____2.46%____1.75%____2.38%____1.98%<br />t to t+5____2.43%____1.74%____2.41%____1.93%<br />t to t+6____2.40%____1.75%____2.49%____1.89%<br />t to t+7____2.30%____1.86%____2.63%____1.89%<br />t to t+8____2.24%____1.94%____2.65%____1.91%</p>
<p>As an example of how to read the table, the annualized growth rate, over a seven year period beginning in a year when interest payments are between 3% and 4% of GDP is 2.63%.</p>
<p>What does this show?  Well, over the short run, say, one to five years, the lower the interest payments on the debt, the faster the growth rate.  Put another way, having debt slows down growth because you have to pay interest on the debt.  That is money that can’t be spent elsewhere, on more useful things.  </p>
<p>The table also shows that in the outyears, interest payments of 3% to 4% of GDP produce the fastest growth rates.  My belief – that’s an anomaly.  I note that this only occurred 7 times.</p>
<p>So to repeat, the higher the debt and the higher the interest rate, the slower the growth rate of real GDP per capita.  </p>
<p>Data<br />GDP from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z2.xls">OMB Table 1.2</a><br />Interest on the debt <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist03z2.xls">OMB Table 3.2</a><br />Real GDP per capita from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">BEA NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  </p>
<p>Note that because interest payment data is for fiscal year, I used real GDP per capita for the third quarter of the calendar year.</p>
<p>As always, if you want my spreadsheet, drop me a line.  (This spreadsheet is growing and contains the data for the previous posts as well!)</p>
<p>Correction.  Thanks to reader Ken Houghton for pointing out an error in the first sentence below the table.</p>
<p>Correction 2.  A second look at the data indicates that my original reasoning for the anomaly was incorrect.  My apologies.</p>
<p>Update.  I modified the headers of the table slightly to (hopefully) make them more readable.</p>

Angry Bear himself was working on fixing it.  I wandered by to take a look, and I seem to be getting much farther along than this morning.  Sooooooo&#8230;. let me press that &#8220;publish post&#8221; button and see what happens.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://norbizness.com/archives/002025.html">Norbizness</a> asks a question on his blog I&#8217;ve had about Angry Bear&#8230;  why are there so many more lurkers than commentators?  Angry Bear seems to get a bit more than 2,000 hits a day on weekdays (check the blogger link).  Even assuming each reader clicks on Angry Bear 4 times a day, we have an average of 500 distinct readers a day.  I read most of the comments (not just to my own posts), and I could probably from memory make a list of 25 or so commentators.  Even if that figure were doubled, at most one out of ten readers posts a comment.  That&#8217;s a pity, because I learn more from reading the comments than I do (forgive me guys) from reading PGL and Steve Kyle, or even from writing stuff myself.  This is not to criticize PGL or Steve Kyle or myself &#8211; merely that the readers bring a far more diverse perspective to things than the three of us can.</p>
<p>So this one is for those readers.  Care to comment?  Note that Norbizness has compiled a list of icebreakers and conversation starters should you find yourself at a loss for words.  (BTW &#8211; I probably should leave a comment at Norbizness&#8217; site.  I don&#8217;t think I ever did.  Naaah&#8230; I think I&#8217;d rather lurk.)</p>

<blockquote>President Bush can balance the budget within five years, or he can get Congress to extend his tax cuts beyond their scheduled expiration, the Congressional Budget Office reported Wednesday &#8211; but probably not both. Bush has said otherwise, committing himself in Tuesday&#8217;s State of the Union address, as he did earlier this month, to providing Congress on Feb. 5 with spending and tax proposals for fiscal 2008 that would put the budget on a path toward balance by 2012.  &#8220;We must balance the federal budget,&#8221; Bush said Tuesday night. &#8220;We can do so without raising taxes.&#8221; The nonpartisan CBO, in its annual report on where current spending and tax policies would take the budget over the next 10 years, did not contradict Bush in so many words. But its tables painted an unmistakable picture of a budget that needed an extra infusion of cash or a sharp reduction in outlays if revenue were ever to exceed spending. And even if the budget could be balanced by 2012, said Peter R. Orszag, the CBO&#8217;s director, the retirement of the baby-boom generation could quickly unbalance it</p></blockquote>
<p>When President Bush promises to avoid a tax increase, the faithful hear him saying that the “scheduled expiration” of the currently low tax rates will not occur.  Schedule expiration to them is a tax increase.  That the CBO is saying that without this scheduled expiration – the unified deficit will not fall to zero should not be surprising to anyone.  But let’s say we did get this reversal of the Bush tax cuts and the unified deficit does fall to zero in 2012.  That would still mean we have a general fund deficit.  As Peter Orszag notes, the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/congressmen-pence-on-taxes-and-social.html">embezzlement</a> of our Social Security reserves might continue.  But it would seem such embezzlement is what some in the GOP have in mind:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Congress is within reach of balancing the budget without raising taxes if significant entitlement reforms are enacted within the next five years,&#8221; said Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the top Republican on the House Budget Committee.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader CoRev recommends we check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Looting-Social-Security-Government-Retirement/dp/0786712813"> The Looting of Social Security: How the Government Is Draining Americas Retirement Account</a>.  From the review by Publishers Weekly: <br />
<blockquote>Because he&#8217;s so hopping mad, everything&#8217;s a matter of hyperbole. Former president George Bush pursued &#8220;one of the most irresponsible fiscal policies in the nation&#8217;s history,&#8221; while Bill Clinton&#8217;s &#8220;outrageous deliberate lie&#8221; about budget surplus projections was his &#8220;greatest sin,&#8221; and after the current President Bush&#8217;s first State of the Union address, &#8220;perhaps never before in American history had the people been played for such fools.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>George H. W. Bush was less fiscally irresponsible than Ronald Reagan, but I would agree that the (ab)use of the unified surplus during the 1990’s opened the door for George W. Bush to play the American people for fools.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110009526">Congressman Mike Pence</a> opposes tax increases but thinks privatization is what the American people really want:<br />
<blockquote>The administration hasn&#8217;t learned from last year. Despite electoral defeats, it is still advancing Social Security reform as an argument over solvency. The centerpiece of George Bush&#8217;s plan was to have been personal retirement accounts for workers who wanted to establish their own nest egg &#8211; a much better deal for them and a down payment on the huge liabilities owed by the entire system. Unfortunately, his plan faltered. The American people did not reject Social Security reform or personal retirement accounts. They rejected the entire debate and how it unfolded. They rejected the notion that the predominant goal was to make the numbers add up or, in the language of the wonks and actuaries, to make it &#8220;solvent.&#8221; Such a yardstick expresses no opinion on how to fix an increasingly bankrupt program, and as a result, blesses both benefit cuts and tax increases alike … Social Security reform must be properly understood. It is not about achieving solvency; it is about improving the system so that it offers a better deal for younger Americans through personal savings accounts. Focusing on solvency will lead inevitably to tax increases and benefit cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have two problems with this.  First, the public does want a defined benefits program.  Secondly, privatization does not create some magical free lunch.  But let me move to where the Congressman and I agree:<br />
<blockquote>the administration should submit a budget that fully protects the Social Security surplus from being used to subsidize government largesse, which Patrick Moynihan once described as &#8220;embezzlement.&#8221; Voters have repeatedly said loudly and clearly that they object to raiding the Social Security surplus.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YmE4M2JjODc2MWJkMzBiMjJhYjg0YmQwNDY5ZDkyOGI=">Carrie Lukas</a> does not:<br />
<blockquote>Social Security faces a $3.8 trillion cash deficit over the next 30 years. From the point of view of an accountant &#8211; or the policymaker eager to duck the issue &#8211; Social Security won’t be in financial crisis during those years because it can redeem the bonds in its much-ballyhooed “trust fund” to make up the deficit. Yet that’s no help to working Americans since Social Security’s assets are really just taxpayer liabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the National Review is in favor of embezzling those payroll contributions we have made over the past 20 plus years to bail out the fiscal irresponsibility of Republican Administrations.  Go figure!  But let’s return to where the Congressman goes supply-side on us:<br />
<blockquote>Raising payroll taxes would prove devastating to working Americans, small business and the economy as a whole. Worse, it would only serve as a short-term band-aid to Social Security&#8217;s financial woes … Overall, the entire economy would slow by 2% to 3%, threatening the standard of living and economic opportunities of every American &#8230; We have been down this road before. In 1990, I was a young candidate for Congress when the last Bush administration sided with a Democrat majority in Congress to pass the largest tax increase in history, all in the name of bipartisanship and compromise. This compromise ushered in economic recession and a two-term Democratic administration in the White House. We cannot walk down the 1990 road to &#8220;compromise&#8221; again.</p></blockquote>
<p>We did have a recession in 1990 as the Federal Reserve failed to pursue significantly expansionary monetary policy as President George H. W. Bush pursued baby steps towards fiscal responsibility.  What the Congressman omits is that the 1993 tax increase was followed by an extended period of strong economics growth.  As the Congressman suggests that spending cuts might solve the general fund mess, Ms. Lukas actually gets one right:<br />
<blockquote>It’s theoretically possible that Congress will at long last eliminate unnecessary agencies and programs, thereby freeing up resources to pay Social Security debts — just don’t count on it. No one who’s ever seen Congress in action believes this will happen, particularly when you consider the magnitude of cuts (entire Departments and programs) that would be necessary to meet Social Security’s obligations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, she immediately returns to the garbage that the Social Security program is running massive deficits:<br />
<blockquote>And even if the dream of massive spending restraint were realized, surely conservatives like Pence would still disdain a ballooning public pension system that devours more and more of the federal budget and more and more taxpayer resources.  In reality, of course, Congress won’t reduce spending and taxes will rise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation – since rightwingers like Ms. Lucas don’t want income taxes raised to pay for the massive amount of defense spending necessitated by our neocon leaders, we have to raid the Social Security Trust Fund.  I realize that the exchange between a Republican Congressman and a rightwing hack has not moved forward this debate at all.  But when has an episode of When Rightwingers Fight ever advanced any policy discussion?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Hoisted from comments, a la Brad DeLong.  This one is by reader Stormy:</p>
<p>Gordon Brown –Chancellor of the Treasury in Britain and sometimes called the “shadow prime minister” – made the following stunning comment:</p>
<p>“Global warming poses a fundamental challenge to the right&#8217;s faith in markets. It is, as Gordon Brown, chancellor, puts it <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/%205e9e4fea...00779e2340.html">&#8220;the world&#8217;s biggest market failure&#8221;.”</a></p>
<p>Brown continues:</p>
<p>“Worse, most of the proposed remedies for global warming involve things the right traditionally abhors. There is global governance in the form of monster international accords such as the Kyoto treaty. There are restrictions on individual liberty as the clamour grows to tax people out of their cars and off their cheap flights. There is a new emphasis on localism as opposed to globalisation. There is also a backlash against the idea that faster economic growth is always desirable or sustainable.”</p>
<p>Now, I agree fully with Brown’s assertion. I would also posit that he only begins to touch the surface of the problem. Our science and intellect—and the very idea of a marketplace—have made our species incredibly successful, maybe too successful. What other species actually has a market place for the exchange of goods?</p>
<p>Be that as it may. I know there are people in the economic blogs who become apoplexic over the thought that global warming and environmental destruction are real, that the dangers they bring are approaching fast, faster than conservative scientists are willing to admit, Hansen among them. </p>
<p>There is another way of approaching the issue from a theoretical point of view. Set aside global warming for a minute, set aside resource depletion—water, fish, land, energy—and a host of other issues that success has brought. Ask the question this way: </p>
<p>Can the mechanisms and principles of the free market work if a society or civilization is confronted with the need for collective action? </p>
<p>By “free market,” I mean a market place free of regulation or excessive governmental control, one in which the individual greed of each player presumably results in “raising all boats.”</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/business/25scene.html?ex=1327381200&#038;en=47c55edd9529cae7&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss/">today’s column</a>  in the New York Times Tyler Cowen says that rising inequality in the US isn&#8217;s as bad as we think it is and also that insofar as it does exist we shouldn&#8217;t worry about it. He makes two mistakes:</p>
</p>
<p>1.  He says that because much of measured inequality in incomes can be traced to differences in education that it isnt a result of policy or of basic unfairness in the system.  This would be true if there were a level playing field in terms of education in the first place.  However, there very obviously isnt.  If you are born to a high income family you are very likely to live in a school district with excellent schools and even if you don’t your parents can pay to send you to a private school.  If you are poor, your school district may not even have enough money to buy you a textbook and often wont have the kinds of advanced placement courses that are becoming so important in getting into the best colleges.   In terms of college the situation is very much worse.  Apart from a handful of top universities rich enough to pursue a need-blind admissions policy, going to college in the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">USA</place></country-region> is a very very very expensive proposition.  Just about every other industrialized country will pay for your college if you are smart enough to get into the best schools, but not in the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">USA</place></country-region>.</p>
</p>
<p>Bottom line – If the deck is stacked against poor people in terms of educational opportunity then we can’t say that tracing income inequality to education shows that “the contemporary American economy isn’t rigged in favor of the rich” to use Tyler Cowen’s terminology.</p>
</p>
<p>2.  Cowen goes on to say:</p>
<p> “The broader philosophical question is why we should worry about inequality — of any kind — much at all. Life is not a race against fellow human beings, and we should discourage people from treating it as such. Many of the rich have made the mistake of viewing their lives as a game of relative status. So why should economists promote this same zero-sum worldview? Yes, there are corporate scandals, but it remains the case that most American wealth today is produced rather than taken from other people.  What matters most is how well people are doing in absolute terms.” </p>
<p>To this, I can only say that it takes a white middle aged economics professor with tenure to come up with a statement like that.  Maybe in Cowen’s world people don’t care if they work just as hard but get less money than others but in the real world it makes people distrustful of the system and causes them to lose faith in the fairness of society.  General belief in the social contract is a long term asset to us all and one we should be very worried about losing.  Only a very narrow view of the world could conclude otherwise.</p></p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Reader Stormy sent me a list of questions to ponder a few days back related to global warming.  Some were specific.  Some were general.  Sadly, right now I don’t have answers, but hopefully I will come up with good ones at some point.  But I’ll open up with something I told Stormy I wasn’t going to write (wonderful – I’m now starting to lie to our readers) since the more I think about it, the more I realize its worth a topic on its own.</p>
<p>I believe global warming is happening, I believe a significant part of it is caused by human activity, and I believe that it probably makes sense for humans to try to do something to mitigate the problem.  Why do I believe any of that when its way outside my area of expertise and I haven’t gone through any data?</p>
<p>It comes down to this.  There is a group of folks, including some that could be called experts, on each side of this debate.  If, like me, one has not been able to do any independent checking, it comes down to which group of folks you believe.  And that in turn comes down to how the two groups stack up when it comes to things I can check or at least reason out.</p>
<p>As an example… the yes side generally seems to include those who believe in evolution, the no side those who don’t.  Now, I’m not a biologist – (I did have the opportunity to play with some population ecology models for a couple years in grad school, but that only says I have some familiarity with theory, nothing more) – but I can reason a few things out.  Here’s one thing I think I’ve reasoned out myself – not that I think its original biological thought, but merely that I don’t think I was exposed to any writings by any expert that actually stated things thus.  </p>
<p>The theory of evolution implies that every species is in transition, always.  Thus, it predicts that some species might not have transitioned far enough away from others to prevent them from interbreeding.  The offspring of such couplings might or might not breed true themselves, depending on how far apart the two species have transitioned.  </p>
<p>And yes, we see results of those interbreedings between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liger">two</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigon">different</a> species today.  Some rural folks see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule">one of these hybrids</a> literally every day.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid">Here’s</a> a larger list of these creatures.</p>
<p>Similarly, the theory of evolution would imply the existence of certain inate behaviors in species that make no sense, but that must have had some survival benefit at some earlier date.  Anyone who has seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog">one of these creatures</a> must have noticed that, after doing their business, they engage in an activity that can only be described as tearing up the lawn and  pelting those that get too close with debris.  Senseless and completely useless behavior.  But one can easily imagine how such behavior might have evolved from behavior similar to that of a cat covering up its poop in a litter box.  </p>
<p>While it is possible to create a story involving a creator creating species in their present form that accounts for this, it seems to me to be more of a stretch.  Hence, I side with those who believe in evolution based on my own ability to reason.  Which means that, when I have to decide between the two sides on global warming, I pick the side that those who believe in evolution tell me makes sense.</p>
<p>There is one more reason I tend to side the evolution crowd – their theory is dynamic, itself evolving.  Which means that obvious errors eventually get chucked out.  The non-evolution crowd, well, from what I can see, its theory is unchanged over thousands of years, even including those parts of the theory that are obviously in error.  </p>
<p>Does that mean its necessarily correct?  Well, no.  These folks might be mistaken about global warming.  In the 1960s, I could have used the same arguments as above to side with folks that the world was heading into a new ice age.  But again, these guys tend to have self-correcting theories.  When data and technological sophistication improves, they change.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I’m not really sure where I’m going with this at this point, but I thought I’d share my thought process.  If I have more to say about global warming, it will be in this context, as I stated in the beginning of the second paragraph of this post.</p>
<p>Update.  Hmmmm.  Perhaps I should <a href="http://patriotboy.blogspot.com/2007_01_21_patriotboy_archive.html#116969922157328428">rethink</a> the whole thing.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/washington/24cnd-wage.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">David Stout</a> reports that we have 54 Senators who think the minimum wage bill should come to the Senate floor for a vote:<br />
<blockquote>Prospects for an increase in the minimum wage suffered a setback today in the Senate, where a move fell short, at least for now, to raise the minimum by $2.10 an hour without tax breaks for small businesses.   The 54 “yes” votes were six short of the number needed to shut off debate and move on to consideration of the bill, which easily passed in the House two week ago … All 43 “no” votes on the motion to end debate were cast by Republicans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/2007_democratic_agenda_/2007/01/senator_call_your_office.php">Jonathan Zasloff</a> who advises that we call the offices of certain Senators:<br />
<blockquote>Take a look at the list of those GOP Senators who voted with the Democrats: Coleman, Collins, Warner, Specter. Notice something? Sure: three of the four are up in 2008, and two&#8211;Coleman and Collins&#8211;might have tough fights on their hands. That means that Sununu of New Hampshire and Smith of Oregon, both of whom are up in 2008, and in blue states, might need to hear from their constituents in the next few days. And loudly. If Carper shows up and votes for cloture, and Johnson recovers and votes the same in a few months, that gets us to 58 votes if Sununu and Smith are effectively pressured.</p></blockquote>
