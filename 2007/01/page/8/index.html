                                <p>GW has already said Iraq is a different kind of war&#8230; there will be no surrender at the end of it.  (Maybe that&#8217;s a good thing &#8211; one can only imagine the signing statement he&#8217;d put on a surrender document.)  The definition of victory in Iraq changed a few times&#8230; now its seems to be getting the Iraqi military to the point where they can take over the fight against the enemy (and who the enemy might be is equally unclear to the administration) allowing US troops to come home</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/9659.html">Steve Benen</a>, <a href="http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=35882&#038;dcn=todaysnews">we learn</a></p>
<p>&#8220;[t]he Defense Department has resisted auditors’ efforts to obtain data on the military readiness of U.S.-trained Iraqi troops.</p>
<p>Comptroller General David M. Walker told audience members at a Government Executive breakfast Wednesday that Defense has not complied with repeated Government Accountability Office requests for evaluations of Iraqi troop preparedness, known as transitional readiness assessments. The Pentagon develops those evaluations for Iraqi and U.S. forces, Walker said, and has a statutory obligation to release them to GAO. </p>
<p>“We’ve received high-level briefings that are helpful, but not adequate,” Walker said. He said he has yet to see the requested information, but Defense Deputy Secretary Gordon England has agreed in principle to turn it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, </p>
<p>&#8220;Walker said he expected to find some embarrassing information that would account for the battle over obtaining them. &#8220;You just can&#8217;t go by how many people you trained,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Of the people that you&#8217;ve trained, how many are left? To what extent do they have loyalty to the unified government of Iraq? To what extent are they properly equipped? To what extent do they have appropriate support?&#8221; &#8220;</p>
<p>And, </p>
<p>&#8220;The most recent attack data, released as part of GAO&#8217;s report this month on key issues for Iraq-related congressional oversight, showed that attacks on Iraqi security forces, Iraqi civilians and coalition forces have followed a wavering upward trend since early 2003, reaching a total of between 5,000 and 6,000 in October 2006. The majority of those were on coalition forces, according to the data. </p>
<p>The report also showed that roughly 300,000 Iraqi security forces have been trained and equipped to date, and that about 80 Iraqi army battalions are leading counterinsurgency operations. The readiness assessments would lend additional insight into those figures. &#8220;</p>
<p>GW has said the surge will work because it has to work.  Since the moving goalposts are no longer credible, what&#8217;s to keep them from simply declaring victory and going home?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I don’t really have time to flesh this out right now, and I’m doing this on the fly, but I was thinking of the disparity between the pay of top managers and line level employees.  We’ve all seen the statistics, and heard the arguments from all sides, so I won’t rehash any of them.  My thought, which for all I know is not original, there are five options:</p>
<p>1.  The earlier pay disparity made more sense<br />2.  The current pay disparity makes more sense<br />3.  The earlier pay disparity makes more sense now, and the current pay disparity would have been more appropriate to use back then<br />4.  The earlier pay disparity made sense back then, and the current pay disparity makes more sense now.<br />5.  Neither pay disparity makes more sense, in the sense that neither has much of an effect on real outcomes</p>
<p>I’m going to dispense with number 3.  I don’t think anyone believes that one.  So we’re left with 1, 2, 4 and 5.  While economic conditions change, its management’s job to impose some vision on companies, if need be, even moving the company out of one industry and into another.  Should we, therefore, expect that on average (and perhaps even at an individual company level), over a reasonably long period (ten years, twenty?) to smooth out any short term fluctuations, </p>
<p>a.  If 1 is true, then profit margins were higher back then<br />b.  If 2 is true, then profit margins are higher now<br />c.  If either 4 or 5 are true, then profit margins are about the same</p>
<p>So how do we break apart option c?  Off the top of my head, I’d guess that if pay disparities are important to firm performance at this time, we would see companies with the greatest pay disparities (as a share of the company’s profit?) between management and line workers doing better at this time than others.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s as far as I got right at this moment.  Your thoughts?</p>

                                <p>With hat tip to <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/lying_in_politics_/2007/01/budget_nonsense_from_right_blogistan.php">Mark Kleiman</a>, let’s check out why <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives2/2007/01/post_1776.php">Glenn Reynolds</a> believes that the Federal budget will be balanced by the middle of next year.  Glenn has been reading <a href="http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2007/01/balanced_budget.html">Skeptical Optimist</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Tax receipts are continuing to grow significantly faster than spending, according to the Monthly Treasury Statement As a result, if these trends continue, the budget will move into balance on July 3, 2008.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that’s being an optimist.  Mark is more skeptical noting that this retired businessman has taken noise in the data and converted it to some linear extrapolation:<br />
<blockquote>He doesn&#8217;t even say it&#8217;s going to happen, only that it would happen if current trends were to continue. In other words, it&#8217;s complete garbage. And Glenn doesn&#8217;t believe it himself, except in an Orwellian way.</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone call the National Review as I think the Skeptical Optimist can help with the next Fuzzchart!</p>

                                <p>AB reader Grace reads <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/subsidizing-student-loans.html">this post</a> and offers us a related story by <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_4987336">Alan M. Collinge</a>:<br />
<blockquote>When Congress amended the Higher Education Act 10 years ago, defaulted student loans became the easiest and most lucrative debt to issue and collect. The amendments imposed huge fees on defaulted student loans and took away bankruptcy protection for student borrowers. It banned refinancing of many student loans, and also allowed draconian collection measures to be taken against student borrowers, including wage garnishment, tax garnishment, withholding of professional certifications, termination from employment, and even Social Security garnishment. Harvard Professor Elizabeth Warren told The Wall Street Journal that &#8220;student loan debt collectors have power that would make a mobster envious.&#8221; And no one makes the mobsters greener than Al Lord and his Student Loan Marketing Corporation, also known as Sallie Mae.</p></blockquote>
<p>One would think that low default risk would translate into low interest rates in a competitive market.  But Mr. Collinge, who is the founder of Student Loan Justice – suggests this market is not all that competitive:<br />
<blockquote>In the company&#8217;s annual report, Lord attributed his company&#8217;s 29% core cash earnings-per-share growth in large part to fees collected from defaulted loans. He forgot to mention that the law allowed him to forbid Sallie&#8217;s customers from refinancing with competitors offering better deals. Meanwhile, the borrowers suffer. Many student loan debtors in default find themselves unable to function in society, and are faced with a decision to either continue the paralysis and live in fear, or begin making payments on a massively inflated amount &#8211; often double, triple or quadruple what they originally borrowed. StudentLoanJustice.Org has received thousands of stories from citizens whose lives have been shattered by their student loans. People who default on student loans are typically decent citizens who, for one reason or another, were not able to capitalize on their education. Most agree that they are responsible to pay back what they borrowed, but most cannot afford to pay back the wildly increased amounts that the federal law has allowed to be imposed upon them. The student loan system in the U.S. has been hijacked by Albert Lord and his friends. Let there be no mistake: These are not creative geniuses who invented a new product or service. These are not captains of industry who built markets and competed their way to the top. Rather, these are nothing more than well-connected executives who took an existing market and used their weight in Congress to erect insurmountable barriers to competition. Here are just two examples: Sallie Mae convinced Congress that allowing borrowers to reconsolidate student loans would cost taxpayers money, so they banned it. Then they sidestepped the law against inducements (also known as kickbacks) by permitting Sallie Mae to loan schools money to make student loans in the school&#8217;s name, then sell them to Sallie Mae for a &#8220;commission.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Collinge is suggesting that these firms got Congress to tilt the market place in their favor and against the interests of those who have taken out student loans.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/01/welfare_for_small_business_own.html#015153">Dean Baker</a> continues his discussion of welfare for the rich<br />
<blockquote>In many cases, these businesses are extremely poor credit risks, so a 4 percent interest rate would be at least 4 percentage points lower than what they would pay in the private sector. Assuming that the subsidy is 4 percentage points, this implies a maximum of $60,000 a year in subsidies, that could last as long as 30 years. (Contrast this with TANF cash payments that average around $6,000 a year and have a maximum duration of 5 years.) I don&#8217;t have anything against small businesses, but the idea that these folks are free marketers is nonsense. They get serious subsidies and this should be made clear in discussing their benefits. It&#8217;s not obvious that it&#8217;s better to hand a small business owner $60,000 than to give child care subsidies for 20 kids.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if take out a student loan, Congress can tilt the bankruptcy rules so default is very difficult and the White House wants no government provided subsidies.  But if you start a small business, you get bankruptcy protection and an interest rate subsidy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maliki disputed President Bush&#8217;s remarks broadcast Tuesday that the execution of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein &#8220;looked like it was kind of a revenge killing&#8221; and took exception to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice&#8217;s Senate testimony last week that Maliki&#8217;s administration was on &#8220;borrowed time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prime minister said statements such as Rice&#8217;s &#8220;give morale boosts for the terrorists and push them toward making an extra effort and making them believe they have defeated the American administration,&#8221; Maliki said. &#8220;But I can tell you that they have not defeated the Iraqi government.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not that Maliki is trustworthy either, but its hard to understand how GW can&#8217;t step back and realize he&#8217;s done more to help Bin Laden&#8217;s cause than even Bin Laden.</p>

                                <p>This post is by Angry Bear regular Divorced One Like Bush.  I have to apologize to the reader and DolB since the post involves graphs and I haven&#8217;t gotten them looking quite right.  Any screw-ups are mine.  You may want to contact DolB directly for a better look at the graphs&#8230; his address is the letter d followed by the letter j followed by becker (all as one word) at cox dot net.)</p>
<p>First, I want to thank PGL and cactus for letting me present an idea at the Angry Bear.  Second, let me say that I&#8217;m not an economist.  I don&#8217;t even play one.  Although I did have one course in college. The following is based on data from 360Data.org and the BEA.</p>
<p>The more I&#8217;ve been looking at trends since 1947 to 2005, I am thinking this issue of tax rates on income is missing the boat.   </p>
<p>Up until around 1966, net dividends, consumption of fixed capital, fed income taxes, non residential investment and undistributed profits rise in parallel to the CPI.  </p>
<p>After 1966,  fed income taxes and consumption of fixed capital (depreciation) start rising faster and accelerates after 1981.  In 1981/82 depreciation rises above income taxes and stays there until 1987.  This is the first time it has happened.   It does this again from 1990 to 1995/96 at which time taxes stay above and rise faster than the depreciation until 2000/01 when it falls to 97/98 levels.  However, depreciation continues to rise.</p>
<p>Against the GDP, depreciation and taxes start to close the gap of slope  in 1974.  The GDP slope declines and the other two increase so that all 3 are at there closest in 2001.  However, depreciation gets closest to GDP in 2005.   All 3 are rising much faster than CPI.</p>
<p>Around 1975, undistributed profits and nonresidential investment start rising faster than CPI.  Net Dividends parallels the CPI.  In 79/80 dividends dives below CPI but investment continues to rise.  By 87/88 dividends are rising over the CPI,  and parallels the rise of taxes to 2005.  Investment falls below CPI 91/93 then rises rapidly until a 2000 decline to below CPI  in 2002 and rises to cross above in 03.  Undistributed profits remains below CPI from 81 to 94.  By 98 it is below CPI again, until it starts it&#8217;s rise in 01 to going almost vertical in 02.</p>
<p>I have noted the dramatic change in personal vs corporate tax ratios after 1981 changing form 1.9/1 to 4.67/1.  A graphs of GDP % changes shows a reduction in the rise at 1981 to ½ that of pre 1981.   The change in exports matches the GDP.  If you chart the change in the % of income for the top 1 percent from 1947 to 2005 it declines from 12.24% in 48 to 8.86 in 1976.  It rises to 10.02 in 1981 and then rises to 21.52 in 2000.  This curve  (stacked) matches exactly the rise in the S &#038; P 500 from 47 to 05.  It&#8217;s acceleration starts in 1981 and goes almost vertical in 1994.</p>
<p>So, what do I get from this?  That this nation has changed it&#8217;s focus as to how to make this nation earn money.  It changed it&#8217;s focus to capital and only capital and this change   has been implemented in stages.   The closing of the gap between GDP, Fed Income taxes and depreciation and pull away from the CPI, investment, dividends, and undistributed profit with the start of the biggest split being 1981 can only mean we changed our thinking.  And it happened with the “Reagan revolution” tax changes.  I have noted at this site that I believe the tax code changes in effect changed labor from an asset to a liability.  It is part of the focus change to capital only.</p>
<p>We gave away revenue in the form of depreciation tax schedules as the first implementation of the focus.  That the tax and depreciation alternate after 1981 and coincides with the tax bills can not be coincident.  That we see a mix of activity in the investment, undistributed profits and dividends after this time that is not evident in the pre 81 period also shows that we have changed our focus.  As mentioned, there is a continual, accelerated rise in dividends after 1987.  This was the second part of the  implementation.  Now most recently,  undistributed profit shows a major rise from 2002, quadrupling.</p>
<p>We have changed in this country, and it is not a change keeping with the premise of the writers of our constitution.  At the same time, I believe the rich will find they have traded quick money for long term security.</p>
<p>I believe this change of thinking is why this country can no longer solve problems as in the past.  We focus on the short term gain (as reflected in our tax policies) and not the long term resolution.  Finally, if we are going to solve the tax rate issue, then we better start looking at not only personal rates, but the total relief of taxes on capital.</p>

                                <p>Our friend <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2007/01/index.html#000759">Bill Polley</a> reads <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2007/01/should_scarcity.html">Michael Mandel</a> and follows up on the question:<br />
<blockquote>Should &#8216;Scarcity&#8217; Be Part of the Definition of Economics</p></blockquote>
<p>Mandel reviews textbooks that talk about behavior and choices and then writes:<br />
<blockquote>My justification for a different definition is that there are big chunks of the economy where scarcity is not important</p></blockquote>
<p>I just lost it when I read this and here was my reply:<br />
<blockquote>I keep saying that the foundation of economics is the Law of Scarcity and now Mandel says forgot all of that. Therein lies my problem with most of his writing. But OK, we talk about people&#8217;s choices. But why do I have to choice. Ah, scarcity. It&#8217;s called Constrained Optimization. Of course, some free lunch types (Lawrence Kudlow, Thomas Sowell when he discusses macroeconomics, and yes &#8211; Michael Mandel) want us to ignore the constrained. Fine &#8211; I choose to consume more of everything. I guess now George W. Bush can hire me as his next head of the CEA!</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe <a href="http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell111705.asp">Thomas Sowell</a> can teach Mandel about the Lure of the Free Lunch – when Sowell is not guilty of practicing <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/lure-of-free-lunch.html">free lunch economics</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Continuing its march through an agenda of popular legislative initiatives, the Democratic-led House is considering cutting interest rates on some college student loans in half.  The House was scheduled to vote Wednesday on the measure, which would help an estimated 5.5 million students who get need-based federal loans. The government pays the interest that accrues on those loans while students are in college. Students pick up the payments after they leave school. The rates would drop from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent in stages over a five-year period under the House proposal. That would cost nearly $6 billion</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/01/budget_reporting_at_npr_one_ye.html#015138">Dean Baker</a> notes that this $6 billion is over a 10-year period:<br />
<blockquote>Well, CBO typically makes budget projections over a 10-year horizon. If this was a 10-year projection (I have no idea), then the projected annual cost is $600 million or approximately 0.02 percent of projected spending over this period.</p></blockquote>
<p>The White House opposes this subsidy.  So NOW they get the fiscal responsibility religion!  But let’s be fair.  Subsidizing student loans is not a free lunch as it will SOMEDAY mean SOMEONE will have to pay more taxes.  Of course, this White House is not saying when or whom.  The efficiency question is whether deviating from market determined borrowing rates to encourage more people to attend college is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTFkZGNkNWNmYTJkOTViN2JmMWY3YTQwYmYzODUzODQ=">Richard Vedder</a> and <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZDJiNzk3ZGUzZWQ2ZWE5Y2FlZmUzYWIyMjI5MzA3MzQ=">Brian Riedl</a> oppose this subsidy.  Someone might fact check this from Riedl:<br />
<blockquote>Despite persistent claims of cuts, student financial aid spending since 2001 has surged by a staggering 400 percent &#8211; from $9.6 billion to $48 billion, according to the Office of Management and Budget. This makes the Office of Federal Student Aid the fastest-growing agency in the entire federal government. Much of this increase has come from an unanticipated surge in the number of college graduates consolidating their student loans (which will lead to large federal subsidies to banks). However, the student aid budget is projected to level off at approximately $25 billion &#8211; nearly triple the 2001 level. Congress’s focus on interest rates is curious because current rates are quite low by historical standards. This school year, the variable student-loan interest rate &#8211; which was set to jump to over 7 percent &#8211; was replaced with a fixed 6.8-percent rate that is lower than in all but six of the past 42 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Market determined rates decline and people borrow more?  What a shocker!  Riedl also argues that student aid has led to an outward shift of the demand curve:<br />
<blockquote>Yet these unending student aid increases haven’t made college more affordable. The average college tuition, adjusted for inflation, has leaped 86 percent for public colleges and 52 percent for private colleges since the 1991-92 school year. Paradoxically, many economists now believe that student-aid hikes actually contribute to tuition increases. Colleges, like businesses, charge as much as their customers are able to pay. So when student aid increases, colleges raise tuition accordingly to capture the additional aid.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally Riedl turns liberal asking why do we subsidize those who will one day be rich:<br />
<blockquote>Given that a college degree raises the average individual’s lifetime earnings by over $1 million, $114 per month is clearly an affordable payment on a very profitable educational investment. Perhaps it’s not in our best interest to tax society at large to further subsidize the 24 percent with college degrees and higher lifetime earnings. America faces substantial budgetary challenges: the war on terror and new homeland security costs must be funded, and projections show worsening budget deficits every year. The coming retirement of 77 million baby boomers will send Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid costs to levels that could require a doubling of all income taxes. In this context, responsible lawmakers should step back and examine whether a new subsidy for college graduates is really a top priority.</p></blockquote>
<p>Odd – Riedl doesn’t mention all that DoD spending but he does mention other entitlement spending which he advocates cutting substantially.  Vedder concedes college is expensive, but he echoes the claim that the rising cost of education is coming from an outward shift of the demand curve fueled by government subsidies.  The Riedl-Vedder argument seems to stem from an implicit assumption that the supply curve is vertical as if the incidence of this subsidy accrues to the colleges and their faculty.</p>

                                <p>Another quick thought about Iraq.  Many on the left insist the problem with Iraq is that you can’t win colonial wars – hence, Iraq was always destined to be a quagmire.  But what’s the difference between a colonial war and one country taking over another country?  Why was the German takeover of Poland not a colonial war, why was that successful (and would have been in the long run, barring outside interference)?  Or the US takeover of Panama (both of them)?  Or any number of other examples?  And why was Saddam able to hold Iraq and keep the borders secure, but the US isn’t able to do it?</p>
<p>My guess… simplistic… is that its easier to keep order than to regain it.  Lose control once and its hard to get it back.  I think Iraq was lost in the early days, when the administration showed no interest in keeping order (except at the oil ministry).  I think they still had a chance, had they managed to get every Iraqi working.  (Idle hands are the devil’s workshop.)  Even in Afghanistan, the administration didn’t screw up quite this badly – they maintained some semblance of order, if only by giving power to a bunch of bloodthirsty warlords, drug dealers, and religious fanatics.  In Iraq, the US military took over, and then our leaders decided it was a good idea to step aside and let the whirlwind begin.</p>
