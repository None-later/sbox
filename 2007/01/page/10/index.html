<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0701.schmitt.html">Mark Schmitt</a> takes us back to the late 1970’s and Ronald Reagan’s 1980 campaign for the White House:<br />
<blockquote>Thirty years ago, a small band of conservatives understood that what they called the era of “tax and spend” &#8211; in which government grew inexorably on a tide of invisible tax increases through Republican and Democratic administrations &#8211; was ready to be challenged. In 1977, Rep. Jack Kemp and Sen. Bill Roth introduced a bill to cut tax rates by a third and index them to inflation. They were radicals even within their party; this was the plan that George H. W. Bush called “voodoo economics.” A year later, California passed Proposition 13 capping property taxes, and Time magazine almost ran out of extreme metaphors &#8211; ”avalanche,” “earthquake,” “revolutionary” &#8211; to describe it. By 1981, a Proposition 13 supporter, Ronald Reagan, was president, and Kemp-Roth was the law. Everyone active in politics today &#8211; virtually every elected official, every speechwriter, every strategist and pollster &#8211; came of age in the 30-year era of tax revolt. It is so deep in our blood that it is surprising to be reminded that there was a time when you could raise taxes and not lose elections. For 30 years, we have seen what happens to people who try straight talk on taxes: “Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won’t tell you. I just did.” Those were admirable words, but the Democratic nominee who spoke them in 1984, Walter Mondale, went on to lose 49 states and the presidency. The casual dishonesty of George H. W. Bush’s “Read my lips &#8211; no new taxes” was more politically successful in 1988, but when he inevitably broke the promise, he, too, lost the presidency. That’s a lesson his son &#8211; and every Democrat &#8211; has learned well.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Republican Party have pretended to be the small government party since 1980 but let’s look at reality.  Our graph shows Federal spending relative to GDP (Fed) as well as state&#038;local spending relative to GDP (SL) from 1976 to 2005.  We have discussed at length the fact that Federal spending as a share of GDP during the 1980’s – mainly because defense purchases rose.  The only significant decline in Federal spending during the 1990’s was the decline in defense spending.  Of course, defense spending has increased during the past few years.  Federal spending as a share of GDP as of 2005 is about where it was in 1976.  And with the retiring of the Baby Boom generation and the passage of the prescription drug benefit – to suggest that Federal spending as a share of GDP will decline is sheer absurdity.</p>
<p>But what about state&#038;local spending?  It was 12.4% of GDP in 1976.  The share rose to 13.7% of GDP as of 2005.  The Proposition 13 crowd told us that state governments spend frivolously but if one looks at these budgets – much of what state and local governments spend go to public education, transportation, and what the Bureau of Economic Analysis calls “public order and safety”.  California’s current government is a Republican who wants more spending on education and transportation.  I trust the Republican Party is not for reducing the size of our police forces.  Now it is true that state and local governments have seen expenditures on health care rise, but this spending is currently around $50 billion per year. </p>
<p>Given the fact that government spending has not been decreased under this “tax revolt”, how are we paying for all this spending by these “big government conservatives”?  Mark continues:<br />
<blockquote>But the truth is that we are heading down a path toward fiscal crisis that will inevitably require a major increase in revenues. In case that sounds like a euphemism, I’ll say it plainly: Taxes must go up. If Democrats try to avoid that fact, they’ll become mired in trench warfare with Republicans over small-bore increases that will cost them political support and won’t really address the problem. But if Democrats seize the opportunity to define a new era of the politics of taxes, as Republicans did 30 years ago, they can shape the debate in a way that may actually help them to achieve some of their most-cherished policy goals. Everyone who looks at the numbers knows that taxes must go up. If we do nothing at all, the years 2007 through 2016 will bring deficits of $3.5 trillion outside of the surplus in Social Security. But doing nothing assumes that all the Bush tax cuts will be allowed to expire as scheduled in 2010 and subsequently. If the tax cuts are extended, and spending remains generally unchanged, the 10-year deficit will total $7.8 trillion. To balance the budget under these conditions would require cutting defense spending by 67 percent, Medicare by 54 percent, or every other program by a third, something that no one in politics has shown any willingness to do. The current path leads straight into a severe economic crisis.</p></blockquote>
<p>President Reagan replaced Tax&#038;Tax and Spend&#038;Spend with Spend&#038;Spend and Borrow&#038;Borrow.  But borrowing is only the deferral of taxation.  The Republican Party is not interested in reducing defense spending, spending on police forces, or even spending on education and transportation.  Since there is no interest in significantly reducing government purchases, the only proposals from conservatives that would materially reduce government spending come down to reducing government support for health care and the taking away of our Social Security retirement benefits even as the Federal government continues to impose payroll taxes.  Yes, the backdoor employment tax increase is part of the Republican game plan as <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002778.html">Barkley</a> notes.  Barkley invites us Angrybears to “Scream It From the Rooptops”.  Well, it’s cold outside so I’m SCREAMING it from my living room.  </p>
<p>Mark notes that some of the more honest conservatives are proposing tax increases on consumption and energy.  Even then – they are talking about tilting the overall tax and transfer system from being slightly progressive to being regressive.  The real political question therefore has never really about how large of a government we want.  It’s simply about who will pay all of those deferred taxes.  George W. Bush will tell you that no one has too.  Of course, George W. Bush lies a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTNmNTlkNDE0MmU1NmY0MmZhMzQxMjI5NzNmZjIzMzc=">James Capretta</a> tries to spin the paygo debate into something where it is George W. Bush who is driving us towards a balanced budget.  And if you think Bill Clinton was a fiscally responsible President, Capretta says give all the credit to Newt:<br />
<blockquote>The seeds of the coming budget conflict were planted in the Clinton era. After taking control of Congress in the 1994 election, Republicans constructed and passed a balanced budget plan with sizeable tax cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Newt’s Republican Congress passed massive spending cuts?  Where?  The defense department’s budget perhaps but Newt is a big defense budget kind of guy.  Nice try, James – but I can see why you had to turn to the National Review to get this spin published!  Of course, the real Laugher comes with Capretta’s forecast as he thinks we can see double digit increases in tax revenues.  Well maybe we can in nominal terms if the Bush fiscal policy ever leads to accelerating inflation.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Forgive the long post.  But in this post, I’m going to show why I think Thomas Sowell is a hack.  I want to be deliberate and methodical, so there is no mistake.  And that takes up a bit of time and a bit of space.</p>
<p>One of the definitions for the word “hack” in <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hack">Dictionary.com</a> is:</p>
<p>“a professional who renounces or surrenders individual independence, integrity, belief, etc., in return for money or other reward in the performance of a task normally thought of as involving a strong personal commitment: a political hack”</p>
<p>Now, consider the following <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hack">Sowell quote from July 2003</a>.  </p>
<p>“Tax rates were cut. Tax revenues were not. More tax revenue was collected during every year of the two Reagan administrations than had ever been collected in any previous year in the history of the country.”</p>
<p>Or <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hack">this one from October 2004</a>:  </p>
<p>“After Ronald Reagan&#8217;s tax rate cuts in the 1980s first brought out anguished cries of &#8220;tax cuts for the rich,&#8221; it turned out that the federal government collected more tax revenue than ever and that people in upper income brackets not only paid a larger amount of taxes than before, but even paid a higher share of all taxes than before.”</p>
<p>What about <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hack">this from May 2006</a>: </p>
<p>“Years later, Ronald Reagan made the same argument and his &#8220;tax cuts for the rich&#8221; produced the same result. Tax receipts during every year of the 1980s were higher than they had ever been in any year before. Moreover, taxes paid specifically by &#8220;the rich&#8221; were higher than before, because their incomes rose so much as the economy boomed that they paid more total taxes despite the reduced tax rate.”</p>
<p>I found these three quotes using Google in less than 3 minutes.  There were plenty more examples of stating essentially the same thing, and doing so over a period of many years.  So we can assume that this is not something he wrote by mistake or which he phrased poorly at one point and has since been misinterpreted.  Instead, we can assume that one of the Sowell talking points (and one that gets repeated a lot – I’ve seen it in the comments section of this blog a few times) is that cutting tax rates leads to more tax revenue coming in, and exhibit A is the fact that federal tax receipts were higher in every year of the Reagan administration than in any year before the Reagan administration.  (In fairness to Sowell, he often points to the Kennedy tax cuts as a good thing too.)  </p>
<p>Now, let’s examine this quote.  I pulled data on tax collections going back to 1950 from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z3.xls">OMB table 1.3</a>.  Guess what.  It turns out that “taxes collected during the administration of President X were higher than taxes collected in all years previous to the administration of President X” is a statement that is true for every President in the sample, except one.  </p>
<p>Long time readers of this blog, not to mention anyone who pays more attention to world events than a stone, can easily guess that the one President for whom it isn’t true is GW.  Sowell, presumably knows that it isn’t true about GW.  Otherwise, when he writes about Reagan (and occasionally JFK), he’d also mention GW, given that GW was the other big tax cutter.  Sowell’s big evidence for cutting taxes also works for raising taxes, but it doesn’t always work for cutting taxes as GW has demonstrated.  I’m sure Sowell knows this – the quotes above, and many others, while leading the reader to a conclusion different from what the facts show, are precise enough not to be a mistruth.  To me, this seems pretty clear evidence that this whole process is deliberate. Since the rewards for doing so are obvious (Sowell seems to be adored by folks who have certain political beliefs), I would think this by itself is enough to qualify Sowell as a hack. </p>
<p>But I will go on.  I assume Sowell knows, and most of his readers, know why “tax revenue was collected during every year of the two Reagan administrations than had ever been collected in any previous year in the history of the country,” and one reason is inflation.  I assume Sowell knows that according to his method of defining success, Argentina during the hyperinflation years would look spectacular.  Until you took into account inflation.  The same is true of St. Ronald the Reagan.</p>
<p>When you look at data going back through 1950 (data also available in OMB table 1.3), “real revenues collected during the administration of President X were higher than real revenues collected in all years previous to the administration of President X” is true for the following Presidents: Ike, LBJ, Carter, GHW, and Clinton.  Funny… Reagan isn’t on the list.  I believe Sowell knows this.  If he truly is an economist, I have a hard time understanding how he wouldn’t have checked.  After all, this “analysis” I just performed isn’t rocket science – it’s a matter of checking which numbers are bigger and which are smaller, a process that can be performed by a child in elementary school. </p>
<p>But because I’m interested in more than making a point – in other words, I like to think I’m more than a hack – I’ll take the next logical step and adjust for population.  After all, the more people, the more taxes will be collected.  </p>
<p>(Population data from 1962 on from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist17z5.xls">OMB Table 17.5</a>, prior to that, used 3rd quarter population from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid"> NIPA Table 7.1</a>)  A rising population means real taxes have a tendency to rise over time.  Despite that, there is enough variability in collections that for none of the presidents can you say (without lying) that “real tax revenue per capita was higher during the administration of President X than it was in all years prior to the administration X.”</p>
<p>So to recap…  I believe Sowell uses a statement that is misleading, and he does it often and deliberately.  (This isn’t exactly a paid gig, so I’m not going to waste my time going through other things that Sowell regularly writes, but I’m fairly confident, from my memory of Sowell’s work, that I can write a similar post about a few other things the guy regularly states.)  I don’t know how you, the reader feels, but to me, its enough to conclude the guy is a hack.  </p>
<p>But I’m on a roll, and I don’t feel like ending this post quite yet.  So…. I’m going to put in two more quotes.  One, I think, is a little <a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/2993636.html">bit more evidence of hackdom</a> on Sowell’s part:</p>
<p>“Now that President Bush has twice gotten himself to the White House, the question is whether he wants to try for Mount Rushmore.”</p>
<p>(I note…  By the time Sowell had written that, it was evident that not only was GW the only President since 1950 to fail what one might term the “Sowell condition” (i.e., collected more taxes in every year of his presidency than was collected in all years before his presidency), but he had actually failed it four years running.  Let it not be said that when GW fails at something everyone else succeeds at, he does it spectacularly, and let it not be said that Sowell won’t mention GW’s name and Mount Rushmore in the same sentence.)</p>
<p>And one more, which he wrote about something else, but which I think applies very nicely to <a href="http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell111705.asp">this whole discussion of tax cuts</a>:</p>
<p>“Costs don&#8217;t go away because you refuse to pay them, any more than gravity goes away if you refuse to acknowledge it….  But the lure of the free lunch goes on.”</p>
<p>Ah yes, Sowell believes that the lure of the free lunch goes on.  That’s one thing Sowell writes that I can believe – I think Sowell is pretty good evidence of that.</p>
<p>Anyway, as always, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them, even Thomas Sowell.</p>

<p>Regular readers may recall I&#8217;ve had a hard time figuring out how to post pictures, tables, etc.  So the purpose of this post is just to test.  If it fails, I will delete the post.</p>
<p>Regular readers may also recall that one of the many creatures alternately wandering or lurking around the apartment is a very large cat we found living behind a dumpster.  This picture dates to a couple weeks after we got her when we were still under the illusion we could find her another home.  (She can be a bit aggressive.)  She&#8217;s increased her body mass by 10% since then and now weighs 17.5 pounds but most people insist she looks closer to 25 pounds.  I expect her weight to continue to inch up now that she&#8217;s living indoors and is healthy.</p>

<blockquote>The American company appointed to advise the US government on the economic reconstruction of Iraq has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars into Republican Party coffers and has admitted that its own finances are in chaos because of accounting errors and bad management.</p></blockquote>
<p>Money is fungible.  A White House channels taxpayer dollars in no bid contracts to a company who in turn channels campaign contributions back to its party for campaigns.  If you read the details, you might react that the amount of funds involved here are not that large.  But how many other ways has this White House used taxpayer monies to reward its base in an exchange for campaign contributions?  A cynic might say this is politics as usual, but isn’t it unusual that this White House started an expensive war that made us less safe in order to facilitate this corruption?</p>

<blockquote>Congressional opposition will not influence President George W. Bush&#8217;s plans to send more troops to Iraq, Vice President Dick Cheney said Sunday, dismissing any effort to &#8220;run a war by committee.&#8221; &#8220;The president is the commander in chief. He&#8217;s the one who has to make these tough decisions,&#8221; Cheney said. Cheney&#8217;s defiant stance comes as both the House and Senate, now controlled by Democrats, prepare to vote on resolutions that oppose additional U.S. troops in Iraq. Cheney said those nonbinding votes would not affect Bush&#8217;s ability to carry out his policies. &#8220;He&#8217;s the guy who&#8217;s got to decide how to use the force and where to deploy the force,&#8221; Cheney said. &#8220;And Congress obviously has to support the effort through the power of the purse. So they&#8217;ve got a role to play, and we certainly recognize that. But you also cannot run a war by committee.&#8221; Any attempts to block Bush&#8217;s efforts would undermine the troops, Cheney said. He took particular aim at Democratic lawmakers who have blasted the president for increasing troops despite opposition from Congress, military advisers and a disgruntled electorate that in November ousted the Republicans as the majority party on Capitol Hill. &#8220;They have absolutely nothing to offer in its place,&#8221; Cheney said of Democratic leaders. &#8220;I have yet to hear a coherent policy from the Democratic side.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If Cheney has not heard a coherent policy from Democrats, it has to be because he and President Bush refuses to LISTEN.  Heck, they didn’t even listen to Baker-Hamilton.  But we have yet to SEE a coherent policy from this Administration.  To say a Democrat led Congress has nothing to offer and to also say that “Congress obviously has to support the effort through the power of the purse” shows the arrogance of this White House.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articlei.html">Article I</a> of the U.S. Constitution grants to the Congress the power<br />
<blockquote>To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and water; </p>
<p>To raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years; </p>
<p>To provide and maintain a navy; </p>
<p>To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces; </p>
<p>To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions; </p>
<p>To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems Dick Cheney has inserted his own interpretation to the Constitution changing “power” to something like – obligation to do whatever King George wants it to do.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I have been known to be testy to the Ken Mehlman wannabe comments such as Movie Guy’s recent “Democrats have no plan” pathetic repeating of the lies from Dick Cheney.  Not only will I not apologize for being testy, I promise to keep firing back at how incredibly STUPID this line is.  Sure, there are 51 Senators on the Democrat side.  Some are close to the Howard Dean position – we never should have invaded.  Some are like Congressman Murtha – supported the invasion but now realize we should not have and we should leave now.  Some are like Joe Biden – should have gone in with more force.  And then there is Bush’s lapdog – Joe Lieberman.  But look at the Republicans starting with Chuck Hagel – who is the anti-Lieberman.  Then there is the Lindsey Graham and John McCain coalition who have constantly said – we should have gone in but Bush’s refusal to adopt the Powell Doctrine was a mistake.  Movie Guy wants to defend Cheney’s dishonest remarks on the premise that not all 51 Senators on the Democrat side have exactly the same view.  Well guess what – not all Republican Senators have the same view either. </p>
<p>But none of this matters – the Iraq Study Group took some of our best from both parties and formed a coherent plan.  Whether one agreed or did not agree with its recommendations – this is clear.  This White House refused to listen.  After all – Bush is king and the rest of us do not matter.  And that’s the point.  Of course, the Ken Mehlmans of the world – which alas seem to include Movie Guy – will find ANYTHING to pick on so as to deflect from the arrogance and the destructiveness of this White House.  I would just hope our readers could do better than to act like a Ken Mehlman wannabe. </p>
<p>My apologies to the other AB readers for this tirade, but this garbage needs to stop.  After all – our kids are sacrificing their lives in Iraq for the mistakes of Ken Mehlman’s boss.</p>

                                <p>The hypocrisy of certain House Republicans is displayed in <a href="http://money.excite.com/jsp/nw/nwdt_rt_top.jsp?news_id=ap-d8mkjeso0&#038;">this AP story</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Fending off charges of favoritism, House Democrats say a just-passed minimum wage bill will be changed to cover all U.S. territories &#8211; including American Samoa &#8211; before it reaches President Bush&#8217;s desk. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters she has instructed the House Education and Labor Committee to help get the bill changed to &#8220;make sure that all of the territories have to comply with the U.S. law on minimum wage.&#8221; Her remark Friday followed accusations from Republicans a day earlier that American Samoa, which is not now covered by the $5.15 an hour federal minimum wage, was not included in the law raising the federal pay floor to $7.25 an hour because StarKist has a large cannery in the island chain. StarKist is owned by Del Monte Foods Co., which has its headquarters in San Francisco, Pelosi&#8217;s district. &#8220;Something is indeed fishy when the federal minimum wage is good for all Americans as espoused by the Democrat majority, yet we exempt a small, in many terms economically struggling island,&#8221; Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., told colleagues on the House floor last week … Spokesmen for both Pelosi and Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., the author of the minimum wage bill, said it excluded American Samoa at the request of nonvoting Delegate Eni Faleomavaega, a Democrat who represents the Pacific island territories in the House. Raising the federal minimum wage would devastate the local tuna industry, Faleomavaega said in a statement last week, noting that American Samoa&#8217;s economy is &#8220;more than 80 percent&#8221; dependent on two U.S. tuna processors, Chicken of the Sea and StarKist.</p></blockquote>
<p>In fairness, <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/01/post_nails_democrats_on_samoa.html#015049">Dean Baker</a> had a similar complaint.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/01/11/barney-frank-kicks-patrick-mchenry-around-the-house-floor">John Amato</a> has video of Patrick McHenry in a battle with Barney Franks where McHenry seems to think procedural matters is the time to argue for the down trodden workers of American Samoa.  You can check out Congressman McHenry’s other positions <a href="http://mchenry.house.gov/">here</a>. In general, he strikes me as the standard faire for a conservative Republican – tax breaks for small businesses, less regulation on businesses, privatization of Social Security, and support for a host of rightwing interferences with personal liberties.  But McHenry does seem to depart from the free trade and labor mobility across borders rhetoric of President Bush.  So maybe he is a Lou Dobbs Democrat at heart. </p>
<p>Will McHenry also push for a $7.25 minimum wage for places like Iraq and Vietnam?  We noted a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/minimum-wages-and-chicken-of-sea.html">couple of things</a> that McHenry forgot to admit.  First, the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/minwage/americanSamoa/ASminwage.htm">Department of Labor</a> documents that there is a $3.26 minimum wage for this sector in American Samoa.  We also note that there are some who think a higher minimum wage would cause an increase in unemployment on this island.  While we present a counterargument – when was the last time you saw a conservative Republican Congressman arguing higher minimum wages increase employment?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Virtual Slavery in Tuna Land? <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGZhMjc2ODgxYzBkMTQzODdkZGYyYmUwYmRkMjFjMzU=">Tim Graham</a> over at NRO’s The Corner reviews the debate over a higher minimum wage by attacking PBS by raising the <a href="http://www.mrc.org/realitycheck/2005/fax20050609.asp">liberal bias</a> allegation:<br />
<blockquote>Exhibit A of a liberal bias at PBS is still the program Now, first hosted by Bill Moyers, and now by David Brancaccio. On Friday night, the blatantly partisan ghost of Moyers was still hanging over the broadcast as Brancaccio led off by linking House Majority Leader Tom DeLay to slavery: “The ethical questions dogging Majority Leader Tom DeLay continue to grow. Have his favors to lobbyists led him from family values to supporting virtual slavery?” The program dealt with DeLay’s relationship with lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who lobbied for the Mariana Islands and their low-wage clothing makers. Brancaccio’s opening echoed liberal Rep. George Miller, who said conditions in the Marianas were close “to indentured servitude, to slavery.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If the labor market on these islands is perfectly competitive, allowing market determined wages should not be compared to slavery.  But what is the labor market is one of monopsony power?  Isn’t there some degree of <a href="http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/boal.monopsony">exploitation</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Monopsony power, like monopoly power, results in economic inefficiency. This is because the monopsonist avoids purchasing the last few units of a good whose value to the monopsonist is greater than their marginal cost, in order to hold down the price paid for prior units. In principle, inefficiency from monopsony can be mitigated by a well- placed legal price floor, which removes the monopsonist&#8217;s power over price and eliminates its incentive to restrict the quantity it purchases. A modest price floor forces the monopsonist to take price as given and increase its purchases toward the level of competitive buyers. However, if the price floor is too high, the monopsonist will reduce its purchases &#8211; just as competitive buyers would do in response to a price floor &#8212; and inefficiency recurs. In labor markets, &#8220;buyers&#8221; are employers, &#8220;sellers&#8221; are individual workers, the &#8220;good&#8221; is time and effort, and the &#8220;price&#8221; is the going wage or salary level. An employer who enjoys monopsony power holds down the wage by limiting the number of workers it hires. At the resulting inefficient level of employment, the value of the last worker&#8217;s contribution to output is greater than the wage she or he receives. This gap was termed the &#8220;rate of exploitation&#8221; by Pigou</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://louisville.bizjournals.com/louisville/othercities/phoenix/stories/2007/01/08/daily55.html">John Shadegg</a> joins Patrick McHenry in his support for workers in American Samoa. It seems <a href="http://www.theabsurdreport.com/2007/starkisting-nancy-pelosi">Faux News</a> is also in this attack on Speaker Pelosi:<br />
<blockquote>GRETCHEN CARLSON: It just so happens Steve that Star Kist tuna ploys 75% of the island’s work force. They are making a lot of tuna there. Apparently then that is shipped off to San Francisco in a district where Nancy Pelosi is from. And now her people are saying that, you know, she has never been influenced by Star Kist at all but other people are saying, hey, this is a little bit of hypocrisy because how can this particular group of people benefit by not having to pay the new minimum wage which is almost $2 more an hour before. <br />KILMEADE: They have two major plants there and then all of a sudden they don’t have to pay this money and this is a woman I’m going to fight corruption and things on the up and up and make things transparent. Reps. Eric Cantor and Patrick McHenry are beside themselves. Cantor says he is shocked. Now Patrick McHenry when he realizes this, hopped up on the Senate floor, says wait a second have you exempted the American Samoa you have included all these other regions and territories, everything else?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ms. Carlson is confused.  They don’t make tuna in this cannery.  They package it.  And the minimum wage is $3.62.  But Kilmeade is even more confused with his “all of a sudden they don’t have to pay this money” as the legislation does not lower the minimum wage that was already in place.  But all of this praise for Eric Cantor and Patrick McHenry strikes me as odd as these two have not been advocates of higher minimum wages before.  I smell a small rightwing conspiracy at work.</p>
<p><strong>Update III</strong>:  We have had a few comments saying my monopsony model is not applicable because the supply curve is elastic.  When there is only one employer (OK, we may have two tuna canneries), then the elasticity of labor supply has to be infinite for the degree of exploitation to be zero.  If anyone has evidence that the labor supply elasticity in American Samoa is infinite, I’d like to see it.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzJlYTBhZTdlNjgzNjFhMDkzMzY5ZDFkNzgzOWYxN2U=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> explains the strength of the stock market this way:<br />
<blockquote>Of course, there are a lot of factors driving these markets. Corporate profits are strong. Productivity is high. Inflation and interest rates are low. And the threat of recession is nil. All this is good for stocks. And markets do work. The high oil prices of the last couple of years have generated huge profits and considerably more production. Oil inventories are high and the world seems to be awash in oil supply. That (along with some unusually warm weather) is driving prices lower.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could quibble with the Bush cheerleading and the claim that there is no chance of a recession, but the general spirit of this passage is about right.  Economic fundamentals drive the stock market.  So explain this jingoism:<br />
<blockquote>Amidst all the pessimism about the U.S. strategy-shift in Iraq, world financial markets seem to be voting for Bush and his plan &#8211; not against … But President Bush’s overhauled Iraq strategy, including a tougher line on Iran, is being viewed by investors as a plus for security in the Middle East. Two large aircraft carrier groups and 16,000 sailors have been positioned in the Persian Gulf. There also are indications that the U.S. will provide Patriot anti-missile defense systems to allies in the region. So, putting all this together, geopolitical risk premiums are actually declining &#8211; hence lower oil prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow hasn’t thought this through.  Suppose Iran calls the bluff and suppose the neocon nitwits that Kudlow hearts convince President Bush to declare war on Iran.  Oil prices will not fall, they’ll increase substantially.  And I seriously doubt that a full scale war in the Middle East will be good for the stock market. </p>
<p>Some four years ago, Kudlow was advocating that we invade Iraq.  Back then, crude oil prices were hovering around $30 a barrel.  Kudlow also predicted back then that U.S. aggression in the Middle East would lower oil prices – to around $12 a barrel. Using data from <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/steo/pub/fsheets/PetroleumPrices_files/frame.htm">this source</a>, I’ve provided a graph to see how well Kudlow’s forecast turned out.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In recent weeks, I’ve had a few posts about religion, and I’ve tried to apply economic concepts to them.  This is another one.  As before, I ask you bear in mind that I am trying to treat the concept with respect, and I ask that you do the same in comments.  I note that this is the hardest of these posts I’ve had to write because a lot of this just doesn’t sound respectful to me no matter how I write it.  Still, I think the question is worth discussing… its been raised by others before.</p>
<p>Today’s LA Times had a nice <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-et-nurutten13jan13,1,3753040.column">column by Tim Rutten</a> about religion in the public sphere especially as it pertains to Romney.  Rutten writes:</p>
<p>“Still, it&#8217;s been nearly half a century since our political journalism has witnessed anything quite as breathtakingly noxious and offensive as the current attempt to discredit Mitt Romney, a potential Republican presidential candidate, because the Massachusetts governor is a Mormon.”</p>
<p>Now, the likelihood that I would vote for Romney is very close to nil, but that is because <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/something-wicked-this-way-comes.html"> I don’t trust what we already know about his economic policies</a>.  I don’t care if he’s a Mormon, Catholic, Southern Baptist, Methodist, Muslim, Jew, Atheist or whatever else, I am not voting for someone who brings on board the likes of Mankiw or Hubbard unless the other guy appears to be GW-incompetent.  </p>
<p>Now, why would the fact that Romney is a Mormon be a problem for many voters?  Well, I could think of several reasons:</p>
<p>1.  If a Mormon has a false belief, it means that he/she doesn’t have the True Faith, whatever that might be.  Presumably, those guided by the True Faith are more likely to make good decisions than those guided by false beliefs.<br />2.  Some testable aspects of LDS doctrine do not appear to match what is observed in the real world.  I understand, for instance, that genetic tests of Native American populations have proven to be a source of controversy within the LDS community as of late.</p>
<p>With respect to item 2, this is not unique to the Mormon faith.  I would think it is not irrational to believe in the concept of a Deity; I don’t think we are anywhere close to being to formulate a testable hypothesis, much less prove that one exists or doesn’t exist.  However, most Holy Books provide a lot more than a statement that a Deity exist – they provide some description of that Deity and of events that occurred.  Some of those descriptions of events do provide testable hypotheses, and it seems every Holy Book has some aspect that is embarrassing and/or seems to contradict known facts.</p>
<p>Which is not necessarily a problem for faith (or Faith).  Contradictory evidence may be an act of some adversary to the Deity, or a test by the Deity, or simply one of those things that is not knowable.  But that presents the first problem with respect to faith in the public arena.  If a person is willing to accept something that contradicts what is out there simply as a matter of faith, why not accept other things as a matter of faith?  In fact, there are plenty of people like that in the field of economics already – the story tellers with the pretty theories that just don’t apply to the real world gain new adherents every day.  Why is it acceptable to refuse to vote for someone because they believe, without any evidence or despite contradictory evidence, that cutting taxes beyond a certain point will lead to faster economic growth or humongous surpluses as far as the eye can see, when it is not acceptable to vote for them because they believe, without any evidence or despite contradictory evidence, that [insert favorite story from favorite Holy Book here]?</p>
<p>And we are also more accepting of beliefs that are held by many than beliefs that are held by a few.  A person who states they believe the Universe was created 6,000 years ago, or that evolution is a myth is accepted by most voters.  On the other hand, most of us feel that a person who states they believe the Universe was created 1,000 years ago, or 20,000 years ago, is just plain crazy.  The difference between 6,000 years, and 1,000 or 20,000 is simply that many people accept 6,000.  Similarly, a person who claims that the Universe is 6,000 years old, but not that it was created by a Deity called “God” is likely to be considered crazy as well; 6,000 years works for a Universe created by God, but not otherwise.  </p>
<p>Put another way, if there were only 100 Mormons in the US it would be acceptable to make fun of Romney’s beliefs and to refuse to vote on him based on them.  But that sentence could easily have been modified… the words Southern Baptist, or Muslim, or Jew might easily have appeared instead of Mormon.  </p>
<p>An alternative reason for accepting faiths that somewhat contradict the existing data is that perhaps much of what is in the Holy Books is not intended to be taken literally.  This too has a problem… if, as we do in this country, one accepts as rational the belief that God specifies that one should not eat cheeseburgers, should we also accept it as rational that its OK to each cheeseburgers because someone who used to persecute God’s followers decided that cheeseburgers was OK 2,000 years ago?</p>
<p>Then there’s the issue of True Faith versus false beliefs.  Presumably, if one has a True Faith, it makes little sense to vote for someone with a different belief if a believer in the True Faith is running for office.</p>
<p>Anyway, I really don’t know where I’m going with this.  Every place I can see this essay leading is very uncomfortable, and I’ve probably been sufficiently offensive so far, though it hasn’t been my intent.  So perhaps its best to take a step back for a moment, and see what you all think.  Please keep it respectful.</p>

<blockquote>CBO estimates that H.R. 4 would have a negligible effect on federal spending because we anticipate that the Secretary would be unable to negotiate prices across the broad range of covered Part D drugs that are more favorable than those obtained by PDPs under current law.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg then gives the microphone to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&#038;name=ViewWeb&#038;articleId=12376">Robert Reich</a>:<br />
<blockquote>House Democrats are pushing a bill to require Medicare to negotiate drug prices. So far, so good. But in what appears to be a bow to the political clout of Big Pharma, the bill does not authorize Medicare to drop from its approved list drugs on which manufacturers fail to offer good deals. This is like Wal-Mart telling its suppliers &#8220;we’re going to use our bargaining clout to get from you the lowest prices for our customers &#8211; but regardless of what price you offer we&#8217;ll still carry your product in our stores.&#8221; What kind of incentive is that? &#8230; The current Democratic bill is calculated to make everyone happy. It allows Democrats to tell seniors and the all-important AARP that they&#8217;re forcing Medicare to negotiate with drug companies. And it also allows Democrats to turn around and tell Big Pharma not to worry because the negotiations won&#8217;t have any real teeth in them. Their drugs will still be approved, regardless of price.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess a free market type might argue that the Democratic campaign theme during the 2006 campaign that a new Congress would put some real teeth in price negotiations was bad economics.  But the Democrats ran on this theme and it looks like they are planning to disappoint those who voted for Democrats based on this issue.</p>

<blockquote>Top officials at the Internal Revenue Service are pushing agents to prematurely close audits of big companies with agreements to have them pay only a fraction of the additional taxes that could be collected, according to dozens of I.R.S. employees who say that the policy is costing the government billions of dollars a year … With one exception, other working agents would talk about the issue only on condition they not be identified because they feared being fired. They said a policy intended to avoid delays in auditing corporations was being pushed so rigidly that it prevented them from pursuing numerous examples of questionable corporate tax deductions … auditors said they were told to limit questioning only to those specific issues that the I.R.S. and the companies had agreed in advance to examine. When other questionable deductions emerged in the course of the audit, they said, additional taxes were ignored. Rank-and-file auditors said that the sharp rise in tax dollars collected per hour of audit was not a sign of an improved auditing system but simply reflected the fact that abusive and illegal tax shelters had become so common that it was easy to find additional taxes due.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>President Bush today named Mark W. Everson, deputy director of the White House budget office, to run the Internal Revenue Service</p></blockquote>
<p>Before Everson was appointed to head the IRS, the suggestion was that it was outgunned and outmanned.  Now the suggestion is that the politicians have told those who were still trying to enforce the tax code to not bother when it comes to large multinational corporations.   The <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/is-irs-enforcing-arms-length-standard.html">last time</a> that I went after the lack of enforcement of transfer pricing, I noted two things – the general drop in the effective tax rates for U.S. based corporations and the effective tax rates for a few life science companies.  But maybe it’s not fair to blame Commissioner Everson for the latter as the life science companies have been playing this game for years.  Plus – part of this game was section 936, which was President Carter’s misguided attempt to use tax loopholes in the hope that it would lead to faster development in Puerto Rico.  Section 936 is gone and the IRS is going after some of the life science companies.  </p>
<p>So I have decided to pick on a retail company – OK, a very large retail company whose effective tax rate has declined since 2003.  But wait a second, how could transfer pricing be responsible for this dip in WalMart’s effective tax rate?  It does not have manufacturing subsidiaries anywhere as it purchases goods from third parties to sell in mostly high tax jurisdictions such as China. So why would an IRS agent even think about tranfer pricing abuse?  Of course, this question is not hard to answer if one reads <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/failure-to-enforce-tax-laws.html">Angrybear</a>.  But to be honest – my post was not exactly rocket science.  So when will the IRS under Commissioner Everson go after this rather simple game?  Or does the IRS even wish to do so?</p>
