I don&#8217;t recall ever meeting Kristol though.)  </p>

<p>&#8220;Say you&#8217;re an average congressman. How do you react to President Bush&#8217;s Iraq speech? You suspect, deep down, that he&#8217;s probably doing more or less what he needs to do. We can&#8217;t just click our heels and get out of Iraq&#8211;the consequences would be disastrous. And the current strategy isn&#8217;t working. You have said so yourself. Last fall you called for replacing Rumsfeld. You&#8217;ve complained that there weren&#8217;t enough troops. What&#8217;s more, you&#8217;ve heard good things about General David Petraeus from colleagues with military expertise. So now Bush has fired Rumsfeld, put Petraeus in command, and sent in more troops. Maybe this new approach deserves a chance to work?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyway, he goes on to call all these average congresscritters Boneless Wonders, because they suspect, deep down, that GW is &#8220;probably doing more or less what he needs to do.&#8221;  I wonder how many people &#8211; how many congresscritters &#8211; think GW is &#8220;probably doing more or less what he needs to do.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Toward the end, he has this great paragraph:  </p>
<p>&#8220;So the Boneless Wonders will push a nonbinding resolution to, as Joe Biden put it, &#8220;demonstrate to the president he&#8217;s on his own.&#8221; Sure, the resolution will weaken the president&#8217;s hand abroad&#8211;but that&#8217;s not their problem. It will lessen the chances of success in Iraq&#8211;but that&#8217;s above their pay grade. It will dispirit friends and embolden enemies&#8211;but maybe there won&#8217;t be much attention paid overseas to some non-binding congressional resolution. It will send the message to the soldiers fighting in Iraq that help is not on the way&#8211;that there are no reinforcements. That&#8217;s unfortunate. But, hey&#8211;they volunteered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, one could easily show that GW himself has done all these horrible things already&#8230; weakening his own hand abroad, lessening the chances of success, etc., through bad planning, bad assumptions, lack of knowledge (I keep thinking back to Paul Wolfowitz telling Congress that there is no history of ethnic strife in Iraq), and a failure to recognize problems until they had become way too big to manage.  One could question what Kristol can possibly mean when he says that barring this resolution, help would be on the way &#8211; most of the added troops apparently are to be existing troops kept from rotating out of Iraq or sent on additional tours in Iraq.   Telling the folks who are there already &#8220;Help is on the way, and by the way, you are the help&#8221; seems like one heck of a bad joke.</p>
<p>But I think the bigger problem is something else.  I hope GW pulls it off.  If he won&#8217;t withdraw the troops, then I hope at least they manage to do something positive.  But let&#8217;s be realistic.  This is GW.  Its not just the war that he fails at..  consider his other <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">big promise</a> from even earlier.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope he proves me wrong.  Lives are stake.  The lives of American troops, the lives of Iraqi troops and the lives of Iraqi civilians.  There&#8217;s also a lot of money that could be spent elsewhere &#8211; that could be used to save lives in the US or abroad.  If GW pulls it off, I&#8217;ll eat crow, and I&#8217;ll do it happily.  But&#8230;</p>
<p>In six months, it will be evident to almost everything that GW has failed again.  In two years, it will be evident even to Kristol.  And then what?  If Iraq is vital now, too vital to leave, why won&#8217;t it be too vital to leave then?   Will Kristol feel we owe the troops Plan J or Plan K, both of which are virtually identical to Plans A through Plan I, differing only in how many years they get stop-lossed?  Will he simply dust off this article and submit it again?</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve said positive things about David Cay Johnston before.  (So has PGL.)  He&#8217;s a NY Times reporter who actually does one heck of a job ferreting out what&#8217;s going on in the tax world.  Today, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/business/12tax.html?ei=5090&#038;en=bf0c9e37852b2075&#038;ex=1326258000&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss&#038;adxnnlx=1168635654-Oej4iD9L4XyEnxAV49CQ1Q">David Cay Johnston does his thing again</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Top officials at the Internal Revenue Service are pushing agents to prematurely close audits of big companies with agreements to have them pay only a fraction of the additional taxes that could be collected, according to dozens of I.R.S. employees who say that the policy is costing the government billions of dollars a year.</p>
<p>Â?ItÂ?s catch and release,Â? said Douglas R. Johnson, an I.R.S. auditor in Colorado for three decades who said he grew so frustrated at how large corporations were allowed to pay far less than what he thought they owed that he transferred to the agencyÂ?s small-business division.</p>
<p>With one exception, other working agents would talk about the issue only on condition they not be identified because they feared being fired. They said a policy intended to avoid delays in auditing corporations was being pushed so rigidly that it prevented them from pursuing numerous examples of questionable corporate tax deductions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following that, there&#8217;s the obligatory quote by someone &#8211; I assume a political appointee &#8211; saying that more is being collected per hour of audit.  I covered that in a post a while back&#8230;  if you reduce enforcement, cheating goes up.  That allows you to collect more in penalties, making it look (to the uninformed, a.k.a. most of Mr. Johnston&#8217;s colleagues) that you&#8217;re doing something while simultaneously letting your base (i.e., the cheaters) pay less.  You win both ways.</p>
<p>The other key points in the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;But auditors said they were told to limit questioning only to those specific issues that the I.R.S. and the companies had agreed in advance to examine. When other questionable deductions emerged in the course of the audit, they said, additional taxes were ignored.&#8221;</p>
<p>and&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of roughly 50 auditors interviewed, only one said he agreed with the new policy, arguing that it was better to audit more companies lightly than a few thoroughly as a strategy to improve compliance with the tax laws. But even this agent agreed with the others that large companies were being allowed to pay far less than they owed.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are many ways to cut taxes.  This is one.</p>

                                <p>Yesterday, in the NRO, <a href="http://tbogg.blogspot.com/2006/07/one-of-these-is-correct-dewey-defeats.html">Rich Lowry</a> <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YWU2NGI4ODI4ODY4NzJjYmU5YTQ5ZTQ2N2FjYTQxOWQ=">asked</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;but wouldn&#8217;t the honorable thing be for the Democrats as a party basically to say, &#8220;This administration has made tragic mistake after tragic mistake in Iraq. We oppose this surge. We don&#8217;t think it will work. But we really, really hope it does work. We will give it a year and anything we can do at the margins to help make it work, we will.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t speak for Democrats but I would imagine this is a rhetorical question.  Even Lowry must know the answer to this one.  Say that the Democrats go along with GW plan.  Say within 6 months, the evidence is sitting there, plain as day, that the plan has failed miserably.  Based on past history, isn&#8217;t it logical to assume it would take Lowry two additional years to stop writing that all is well and realize there&#8217;s a problem?  And how much longer would it take GW?  </p>
<p>As GW himself said, &#8220;There&#8217;s an old saying in Tennessee — I know it&#8217;s in Texas, probably in Tennessee — that says, fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can&#8217;t get fooled again.&#8221;  Or something like that.</p>
<p>Update &#8211; Removed a comma and corrected spelling error in first sentence.  I gotta learn to run spell check&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Those who lean left on economic issues generally feel that tax rates are too low.   Those who lean right on economic issues generally feel that tax rates are too high.</p>
<p>A common retort to the left position &#8211; one that has appeared in comments to various posts on this blog, in fact &#8211; is:  Why don&#8217;t you raise tax rates to 100% if taxes are so good?  But most on the left don&#8217;t feel that tax rates of 100% are optimal.  If pressed to come up with a figure, most of us would say the optimal tax rates for growth and tax collection (and of course, the optimal tax rate for growth and the optimal tax rate for tax collection can be a bit different) is somewhere in the neighborhood of what rates were during the Clinton era, or perhaps between that and what they were when Reagan took office.  In fact, I&#8217;ve had a few posts arguing those points.</p>
<p>A common retort to the right position &#8211; one that has appeared in comments to various other comments to posts on this blog, in fact &#8211; is:  Why don&#8217;t you cut tax rates to 0% if tax cuts are so good?  Now, presumably, with the exception of some deluded folks, nobody on the right feels that tax rates of 0% is the way to go.  But then what is the &#8220;optimal tax rate&#8221; according to the tax cutters?  Are we, at long last, at that point?  Are optimal tax rates lower still?  In the teens?  In the single digits?  If pressed, if they had to put a figure on it, what is the rate (or range around which) they feel the optimum sits?</p>

                                <p>Steve Benen of the Carpetbagger Report has a nice <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/9593.html">post on the minimum wage</a>.  Its short, and hits the point very well.  I&#8217;m just gonna go ahead and steal the whole thing.  What follows is Steve&#8217;s post in its entirety&#8230;</p>
<p>Last month, Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/9257.html">bemoaned</a> the notion of lawmakers working more hours on the Hill. Families, he said, are more important. Kingston told the WaPo, in response to a Dem proposal to extend the congressional work week to five days, “Keeping us up here eats away at families. Marriages suffer. The Democrats could care less about families — that’s what this says.”</p>
<p>With this in mind, Kingston has some <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/01/11/kingston-work-longer/">interesting ideas</a> about how low-income families can get out of poverty.</p>
<p>Last night, Kingston shared some advice with Americans living in poverty: work longer hours. During House debate over the minimum wage, Kingston said raising the minimum wage would do nothing for poor Americans. Instead, if people marry and work longer hours, “they would be out of poverty,” he said. “It’s an economic fact.”<br />(Note from cactus &#8211; my incompetence with blogger prevents me from indenting the above paragraph as Benen did in the original.  My apologies.)</p>
<p>First, if people work longer hours, won’t that “eat away at families”?</p>
<p>Second, as Nico helpfully <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/01/11/kingston-work-longer/">points out</a>, “The annual salary for workers earning the national minimum wage still leaves a family of three about $6,000 short of the poverty threshold.” In most instances, overtime pay isn’t much of an option. In other words, working longer hours won’t solve the problem.</p>
<p>If Kingston and his like-minded allies believe the minimum wage should stay at $5.15, let them explain why. Coming up with silly excuses to reject an increase only leaves Kingston looking foolish. Again.</p>

<blockquote>The New Deal and the Depression: Interesting stuff. I agree that the NIRA might have raised the structural rate of unemployment &#8211; but the economy got nowhere near the structural level of unemployment during the NIRA period, so what difference could that have made? What really puzzles me, though, is the assertion that wage and price rigidity created by the New Deal aborted the natural recovery process. Through what channel could price flexibility have helped? The US spent most of the 30s pretty much up against the zero bound, with interest rates well below 1 percent. A fall in the price level would have had the same effect as an increase in the monetary base &#8211; that is, no effect at all &#8211; except for the slight wealth effect of rising real balances. And even this slight effect could easily have been outweighed by debt deflation. You just have to bear in mind that this was, um, the Great Depression &#8211; normal rules about monetary policy did not apply. And the same goes for any possible role of price flexibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the liquidity trap as in a horizontal LM curve.  The debt deflation aspect is further discussed <a href="http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/keynes/counterattack.htm">here</a>:  <br />
<blockquote>As he notes falling money wages and price levels will lead to redistributions of income &#8211; firstly, from wage-earners to non-wage earners and, secondly, from debtors to creditors, the net effect of which would be the reduction in the economy-wide marginal propensity to consume &#8230; The income redistribution effect was taken up by Michal Kalecki &#8230;  in an imperfect competition model. Specifically, if money wages decline, then the mark-up between prices and wages would increase (i.e. increasing &#8220;degree of monopoly&#8221; in Kalecki&#8217;s language). This would result in a redistribution of income from wage-earner to profit-earners. If profit-earners have a lower propensity to consume than wage-earners (a reasonable assumption given social reality), then the average marginal propensity to consume in the economy declines and thus aggregate demand declines. Thus, far from being stabilizing, the reduction in money wages in a situation of unemployment can lead to reductions in aggregate demand and thus more unemployment. The second effect was already expressed in Keynes (1931) and in Irving Fisher (1933) and is known as the &#8220;Debt-Deflation Effect&#8221;. Effectively, if prices decline, then the real value of private wealth increases, which implies that the liabilities of debtors and assets of creditors increase in real terms. Again, complying to social reality, debtors have a higher marginal propensity to consume relative to creditors (which might help explain how they became debtors in the first place!), consequently, there is a reallocation of real wealth from debtors to creditors and thus the aggregate marginal propensity to consume declines. The result of price flexibility in situations of unemployment, then, is once again a decline in consumption demand and thus a further reduction in aggregate demand and employment. This Debt-Deflation Effect was given a central role by James Tobin (1980) &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, a redistribution of income from individuals with a lower propensity to save to individuals with a higher propensity to save would shift the IS curve inwards.  And if the LM curve is flat, aggregate demand would decline.</p>
<p>Update: Daniel Gross reads <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-deal-and-investment-demand.html">my comment</a> on what <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/01/roosevelts_law.html">Bryan Caplan</a> wrote and emails me this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is the sheer a-historicity of it. Roosevelt scared investors and businessmen? Did he scare them as much as, oh, Stalin, who controlled one of the world&#8217;s largest economies and was expanding his influence? or as much as Mussolini? Or as much as the fascist government of Japan? Or as much as Hitler, who was buys confiscating property of Jewish investors and businessmen? On a comparative basis, the U.S. was certainly the country in the 1930s that was the most hospitable to private investment and capital formation. Economic history unfolds in real history, not in some imagined world. The New Deal was a success if only because it kept the U.S. from sliding into the type of horrific fascism that infected half of Europe and the pathetic weakness that affected the other half.</p></blockquote>
<p>As we noted, investment demand increased substantially from 1932 to 1937.  Daniel Gross mocks the idea that FDR scared investors – at least relative to the fear investors may have had seeing what was going on in Germany, Italy, Japan, and/or Russia.</p>

They&#8217;re not useful against insurgents.  (Whether they&#8217;re useful at all is for someone with more knowledge than I to say.)  I believe their purpose is to shoot down incoming aircraft and medium or long range missiles.</p>

                                <p>I was thinking about GW’s speech last night, as well as Rich Lowry’s comments which I never heard.  It occurs to me that while we don’t like to talk about it, we do assign different valuations to the lives of different cohorts of people.  There still remains some semblance of “women and children first” – the idea being that if you have to sacrifice anyone, you sacrifice men first.</p>
<p>Similarly, I’m a member of Kaiser health plan.  Most years, they offer flu shots to the elderly first… the elderly are more susceptible.  However, I suspect that if a pandemic that killed very large numbers of people indiscriminately came by, and there were only a fraction of the doses needed for all, the elderly would be at the back of the list of those who would get shots.  Children and young adults would be first in line.  I haven’t thought through how to be prove this, but I imagine that these two groups are implicitly the most valuable to society.  </p>
<p>If there wasn’t enough for children and young adults both, and the pandemic was serious enough to potentially wipe out entire cities, my suspicion is that the young adults would have first priority even over children – they, at least can survive on their own.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, in war, that’s also the first group sacrificed – they’re the ones that make up the bulk of the military, after all.  Why the paradox?  In part, its because they have the best characteristics for fighting and thus for winning.  (Listen to me – I’m sounding like GW!)  Also, in this “war of ideas,” there are <a href="http://patriotboy.blogspot.com/2007_01_07_patriotboy_archive.html#116831419561322253">those who have the ideas</a>, <a href="http://appserv02.uncw.edu/news/custom/Goldberg_jonah.jpg">those that sell the ideas</a>, <a href="http://operationyellowelephant.blogspot.com/">those who cheerlead the ideas</a>, and those <a href="http://www.lanuevaprovincia.com.ar/06/11/23/6bn0431.jpg">whose existence alone is important</a>.  <a href="http://www.goarmy.com/flindex.jsp">Those who implement the ideas</a> are another group entirely.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>So I listened to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-na-bushspeech11jan11,0,45176.story?coll=la-home-headlines">GW&#8217;s speech</a>.  I turned it off after the speech, and before Rich Lowry started to speak.  <a href="http://tbogg.blogspot.com/2006/07/one-of-these-is-correct-dewey-defeats.html">Rich Lowry</a>.  On the war!  I understand Lowry stopped being fully on board after he opened his eyes a few weeks ago, but that still puts him thirty some odd years behind the average kitten.  Now, if they can put Rich Lowry on tv to talk about the President&#8217;s speech and the war, well then I&#8217;m qualified to talk about it too.</p>
<p>Anyway, given he&#8217;s not pulling out the troops, I hope GW pulls it off.  I&#8217;m still not 100% sure what &#8220;it&#8221; is, but I hope something positive happens.  Of course, its hard to expect something positive from Very Last People to Have Realized There&#8217;s a Problem, but we can hope. </p>
<p>A few things that jumped out at me:<br />1.  There was something about loosening rules of engagement that doesn&#8217;t seem to be in the official transcript the White House released before the speech.  I would think if the military is having issues against insurgents, loosening rules of engagement is a very tricky thing.  The looser the rules, the more innocent civilians die, and the more innocent civilians die, the more insurgents you have.<br />2.  &#8220;These troops will work with Iraqi and tribal forces to keep up the pressure on the terrorists.&#8221;  I&#8217;m curious who the President thinks tribal forces might actually be, and how he thinks they differ from the &#8220;sectarian&#8221; folks that he told us were one of the big problems in Iraq.  <br />3.  Apparently there&#8217;s going to be a new bipartisan committee to advise the President.  This was Lieberman&#8217;s idea.  I&#8217;m guessing Lieberman and a couple of Republicans is what qualifies as bipartisan these days.<br />4.  The Marine Corps and the Army are going to increase in size.  Considering the stories that we&#8217;ve been reading about how they&#8217;re barely making quota even though they&#8217;ve been dropping the standards required of new recruits, you gotta wonder how they plan to do that.  (Could that be the new Foreign Legion thing?)  <br />5.  &#8220;The year ahead will demand more patience, sacrifice, and resolve.&#8221;  I&#8217;ll say&#8230; he didn&#8217;t even mention tax cuts at all.  How does he think we&#8217;re going to pay for this thing with no more tax cuts?  But seriously &#8211; who, other than the military and their family members, is more patience, sacrifice, and resolve being required from?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/01/roosevelts_law.html">Bryan Caplan</a> starts off by saying <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2007/01/the_new_deal_an.html">James Hamilton</a> and <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/01/the_new_deal_an.html">Arnold Kling</a> are making sense when they say that not all of the New Deal policies were necessarily desirable for restoring full employment.  As Arnold noted:<br />
<blockquote>A reasonable view is that some New Deal policies helped, and some hurt. In fact, the book Reflections on the Great Depression, which interviews many famous economists, finds James Tobin criticizing some New Deal policies (the cartelization policies that Hamilton decries) and Milton Friedman praising some of them (going off the gold standard, which Hamilton praises).</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/01/the_new_deal_an.html">Mark Thoma</a> reformulation of what <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/01/daniel_gross_ha.html">Brad DeLong</a> said is about right:<br />
<blockquote>Most economists would not argue that, on net, the New Deal prolonged the Great Depression.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d just like to add two things to this debate.  The minor point is to remind folks about what <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/03/AR2007010301619.html">George Will</a> wrote that set Brad and <a href="http://www.danielgross.net/archives/2006/12/31-week/index.html#001266">Daniel Gross</a> off:<br />
<blockquote>A federal minimum wage is an idea whose time came in 1938, when public confidence in markets was at a nadir and the federal government&#8217;s confidence in itself was at an apogee. This, in spite of the fact that with 19 percent unemployment and the economy contracting by 6.2 percent in 1938, the New Deal&#8217;s frenetic attempts had failed to end, and perhaps had prolonged, the Depression. Today, raising the federal minimum wage is a bad idea whose time has come, for two reasons, the first of which is that some Democrats have an evidently incurable disease &#8211; New Deal Nostalgia.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, rightwingers are attacking the minimum wage as if it would eliminate all those 7 million jobs that were created only because of the 2003 tax cuts (cough, cough).  But also note that Will notes the second recession of the 1930’s.  More on that in a second.  First, back to Bryan Caplan who just set me off:<br />
<blockquote>On the negatives of the New Deal, though, it&#8217;s also worth pointing out how scary Roosevelt&#8217;s policies and populist rhetoric were to business. If I were a potential investor in 1933, I&#8217;d be thinking about how to protect my assets, not looking for good projects to invest in. I don&#8217;t think that Brad DeLong would deny that Mugabe had made people afraid to invest in Zimbabwe.  Why should he doubt that &#8211; on a smaller scale, of course &#8211; Roosevelt made people afraid to invest in the U.S.?</p></blockquote>
<p>Might we remind Bryan that investment demand (in 2000$) rose from $11.5 billion in 1932 to $91.1 billion in 1937?  Now you might wish to remind me of the 1937-38 recession mentioned above and how investment demand fell.  Which is why I’m inviting <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/01/did_the_new_dea.html">Tyler Cowen</a> to the microphone:<br />
<blockquote>I had thought that bad monetary policy in 1937-8 (arguably not &#8220;the New Deal&#8221;, though we tread close to semantics) was at fault more than fiscal policy</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/01/the_new_deal_an.html">Brad DeLong</a> offers much more including an edit to a comment over at Brad’s place, which appropriately notes:<br />
<blockquote>Bryan does more than offer no facts: Bryan says that Robert Mugabe is Franklin Roosevelt writ large.</p></blockquote>
<p>As part of an update to his follow-up post, Brad adds:<br />
<blockquote>And I think that I am safe in classifying somebody who sees Robert Mugabe as Franklin Roosevelt writ large as not entirely normal.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Well said!</strong>  Caplan was wrong on the facts and doing his best to look like Sean Hannity.   Not one of his finer posts.</p>
