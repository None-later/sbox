<blockquote>However, if the Dems raise the top rates for capgains and dividends and income, all of which would penalize investment and drive capital offshore (to China, India, Eastern Europe), then it would damage our economy across-the-board.

<blockquote>You might want to reconsider that claim. Maybe in the suburbs of New York City, but nowhere else. Salary.com indicates that the median pay for a police officer is around $50,000 and for a teacher around $46,000.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/01/federal-tax-progressivity-just-facts.html">Greg Mankiw</a> summarizes a new CBO report and writes:<br />
<blockquote>here are the effective federal tax rates for 2004 (the most recent year available in this report):</p>
<p>Lowest quintile, 4.5<br />Second quintile, 10.0<br />Middle quintile, 13.9<br />Fourth quintile, 17.2<br />Highest quintle, 25.1</p>
<p>Top 10 percent, 26.9<br />Top 5 percent, 28.5<br />Top 1 percent, 31.1</p>
<p>These numbers include all federal taxes (not just income taxes) and are expressed as a percentage of household income.</p></blockquote>
<p>In case, you are wondering – this does include payroll taxes.  Of course, it does not include state and local taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Permit me to expand on my comment in a couple of directions.  The first is to note that in 2004, the ratio of state&#038;local tax revenues to GDP was 13.6%, which compares to only 12% in 1979.  If (and I don’t have any particular data on this), state&#038;local taxation tends to be regressive, the reporting of Federal tax progressivity overstates overall tax progressivity.  </p>
<p>But I think there is a more important point – that being that current Federal tax revenues are not covering Federal spending so there is a huge amount of deferred taxation.  And of course, the Bush Administration is not about to tell us who will pay these deferred taxes as they are trying to claim no one will.  To give some historical context, I’ve placed on a single graph, the effective tax rate for the upper quartile from 1979 to 2004 (blue line) as well as the ratio of Federal spending to GDP (pink line).  The former has always dominated the latter at the Federal level, but notice that the effective tax rate for the upper quartile tends to be a lot lower under Republican Administrations than under Democratic Administrations.  And yet, the ratio of Federal spending under Bush43 was approximately what it was under Jimmy Carter. </p>

<p>The moral is that since we don’t know who will pay for all of these deferred taxes, any calculation based on current tax revenues is misleading.  Now if the deferred tax bills will be spread out in progressive manner, then Dr. Mankiw’s post might make some sense.  But as far as I can tell – the only suggestions from Republicans as to how to pay off these deferred taxes seem to take the form of regressive taxes.</p>

                                <p>Labor Supply and Labor Demand</p>
<p>There’s been a lot of talk about the minimum wage lately, and the idea that most people have is that the labor market behaves a like a well-behaved introductory economics market, where a rise in prices is associated with a decrease in quantity, and vice versa.  But does the labor market behave the way the textbooks tell us?</p>
<p>Anyone looking at supply and demand for a product faces an identification problem; supply and demand are generally not observable.  What is observable is the price and quantity.  </p>
<p>The table below looks at the the correlation between the real seasonal average hourly earnings of production workers (Wt) and the seasonal employment to population (16 years and over) ratio (Qt) for 8 non-randomly selected periods beginning in January 1964 when hourly wage data became available, and running through October 2006, after which only preliminary wage data is available.   The table also shows the correlation between Wt and  Qt of 6 months later, and between Qt and  Wt of 6 months later for selected time periods: </p>
<p>Periods___________Wt, Qt_____Wt, Qt+6______Wt+6, Qt<br />Jan 1964 &#8211; Jan 1969_____0.94_____0.95_____0.94<br />Jan 1969 &#8211; Aug 1974____-0.11_____0.34_____-0.54<br />Aug 1974 &#8211; Jan 1977_____0.85_____0.33_____0.39<br />Jan 1977 &#8211; Jan 1981_____-0.25_____0.14_____-0.51<br />Jan 1981 &#8211; Jan 1989_____-0.80_____-0.73_____-0.88<br />Jan 1989 &#8211; Jan 1993_____0.90_____0.92_____0.80<br />Jan 1993 &#8211; Jan 2001_____0.85_____0.80_____0.89<br />Jan 2001 &#8211; Oct 2006_____-0.71_____-0.71_____-0.27</p>
<p>The next table shows the percentage change in these two series over the same time periods:</p>
<p>___________________% ch W__________change in Q<br />Jan 1964 &#8211; Jan 1969_____8.32%__________2.3<br />Jan 1969 &#8211; Aug 1974_____2.46%__________0.2<br />Aug 1974 &#8211; Jan 1977_____-0.06%__________-0.8<br />Jan 1977 &#8211; Jan 1981_____-8.04%__________2.1<br />Jan 1981 &#8211; Jan 1989_____-3.54%__________3.8<br />Jan 1989 &#8211; Jan 1993_____-3.80%__________-1.5<br />Jan 1993 &#8211; Jan 2001_____6.50%__________3<br />Jan 2001 &#8211; Oct 2006_____2.75%__________-1.1</p>
<p>The folks who talk about the labor market as if it’s nothing more than a giant demand curve – insisting that a fall in employment accompanies every rise in prices – would only be pleased under two of the eight periods shown above, namely the Reagan and GW administrations.  Under Reagan, real wages fell, but employment rose, and under GW, real wages have risen a bit but employment has fallen.  </p>
<p>Workers fared best under LBJ and Clinton.  Both quantity of labor, and its price rose, and the correlation between wages and employment was positive.   </p>
<p>Both wages and employment increased under Nixon, but not by as much, partly because every time there was much of an increase in employment, wages tended to drop six months later.</p>
<p>Under Ford, the correlation between wages and employment was positive, but unfortunately, that is because both series fell.  </p>
<p>Workers didn’t fare particular well under Carter or GW either.</p>
<p>So what does all this mean?  Well, on aggregate at least, the labor market is more complicated than folks like George Will would assume.  </p>

                                <p>A few weeks ago, an AB reader asked me what I thought about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0313336881?tag=luskinnet-20&#038;camp=14573&#038;creative=327641&#038;linkCode=as1&#038;creativeASIN=0313336881&#038;adid=1TBV1ZPXFJDS7PRN6GMJ&#038;">Income and Wealth</a> by Alan Reynolds.  Since I had not read it yet – I tried to find some reviews only to discover the Usual Suspects on the rightwing fringe were all praising this new book.  I did read the <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110009398">WSJ oped</a> attacking James Web.  </p>
<p>Since then, there have been lots of critiques by economists I trust who have checked out the claims from Reynolds so I don’t have to.  Recently, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/01/increasing_ineq.html">Mark Thoma</a> summarized these critiques in a post entitled Increasing Inequality in Not a Statistical Illusion. Mark also linked to a recent Reynolds <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20070106-102609-8528r.htm">reply to his critiques</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Two &#8220;liberal&#8221; blogs went predictably apoplectic, but in ways that had absolutely nothing to do with what I had written. Berkeley professor Brad DeLong initially said there is never any point in paying attention to anything on the Wall Street Journal editorial page. Someone balked at that, so he tried describing two clear, consistent and distinctly separate statements from my article as &#8220;three-card monte.&#8221; Such amusing irrelevancies led to the usual swapping of links between like-minded cheerleaders at another blog run by Mark Thoma of the University of Oregon. He somehow imagined my article relied mainly on Census Data, and therefore borrowed some curious comments from a New York Times column by Paul Krugman. Mr. Krugman complained that Census estimates are from a &#8220;limited sample&#8221; (as if IRS estimates are not) and wrote &#8220;the questionnaire is &#8216;top-coded&#8217;: if the individual interviewed has earnings higher than $999,999, those earnings are recorded simply as $999,999.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Reynolds continues in this vein in manner fitting only for the pages of the Washington Times and then closes with:<br />
<blockquote>If anyone can demonstrate I misquoted such scholars, or am mistaken about any facts in last month&#8217;s Wall Street Journal piece, I will gladly correct the record just as readily as I have now corrected the record about my 1992 piece.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sensing one of his rightwing buddies was in trouble, <a href="http://www.poorandstupid.com/2007_01_07_chronArchive.asp#116819262038496533">Donald Luskin</a> weighed in:<br />
<blockquote>What makes Reynolds&#8217; work so powerful is that he&#8217;s patiently and systematically demolished the apparent experimental evidence behind that hypothesis, and dared to stand nearly alone against the conventional wisdom of economic science. When it comes to income inequality, Reynolds is a modern Galileo &#8230; Thoma then reproduces Reynolds&#8217; op-ed from the Washington Times in which he responds to all his critics. It&#8217;s a brilliant and patient defense. Point by point he explains not only why his arguments are correct, but reveals the McCarthyesque nastiness of his critics&#8217; unwarranted and illegitimate accusations against him. At the end, Thoma &#8211; who has done a public service by hosting this debate, but at the same time has clearly sided with the liberal attackers &#8212; is reduced to what amounts to stunned silence. He has nothing to say after Reynolds&#8217; virtuosic defense but to splutter that the income inequality hypothesis is nevertheless believed by many reputable economists. Which is about like saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t confuse me with the facts, Mr. Galileo. All of the finest minds say the universe revolves around the Earth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>McCarthyesque nastiness?  Find for me where the liberals have called Reynolds a Communist or traitor.  But I have to wonder if Luskin even understands this debate over the evidence.  Has he consulted with Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez as to whether Reynolds has misquoted them or was mistaken about any facts.  Luskin must not have realized that <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/01/thomas_piketty_.html">Mark Thoma</a> has reviewed the Piketty-Saez review of what Reynolds has claimed. </p>
<p>But who is this Galileo that Luskin refers to?  He can’t be referring to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Galileo.html"> Galileo Galilei</a>.  That Italian scientist would not need to produce his findings in a rag like the Washington Times.  </p>
<p>No – I still have not read <em>Income and Wealth</em> as I see no reason to waste my time.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Suppose I told you that there is no evidence that Shaq has grown in the last five years.  Would you conclude that he’s short?  <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/2007/01/inequality_is_it_real_1">Matthew Yglesias</a> reads the following from <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2007/01/08/has-us-income-inequality-really-increased">Cato</a>: <br />
<blockquote>In “Has U.S. Income Inequality Really Increased?,” Reynolds concludes, “There is no clear evidence of a significant and sustained increase in the inequality of U.S. incomes, wages, consumption, or wealth since the late 1980s.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Matthew reasonably replies:<br />
<blockquote>Even if you believe that there&#8217;s no &#8220;clear&#8221; evidence of a &#8220;significant and sustained&#8221; increase in inequality since the late 1980s this, rather clearly, wouldn&#8217;t rebut the assertion that &#8220;the share of U.S. income going to the top 1 percent has increased substantially since the 1970s.&#8221; People who would portray the two claims as contradictory are much more interested in convincing you that there&#8217;s no inequality problem than they are in finding out what&#8217;s happening with inequality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah but is this Cato claim correct?  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/01/people_who_woul.html">Brad DeLong</a> says no:<br />
<blockquote>I don&#8217;t think that &#8220;slipperiness&#8221; adequately characterizes what we&#8217;re dealing with here.  And, of course, there is lots of clear evidence of a significant and sustained increase in inequality since the late 1980s. I would love to believe that U.S. income inequality took an upward leap in the 1970s and 1980s and then settled down again. I can&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>

<p>The restored cuts statewide amount to $383.6 million. While it is difficult to estimate how much of that money was destined for south of Boston, the funds clearly benefit dozens of projects here and help thousands of people.</p>
<p>The affected projects range from downtown revitalization work in Stoughton, Milton, and Quincy, to a skating rink in Randolph. Workers at Bridgewater State College and those who work with the elderly will get long-awaited raises. And ratepayers in communities served by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority will get $25 million in rate relief.</p>
<p>In Braintree, the list of restored budget items illustrates why Patrick&#8217;s reversal of his predecessor&#8217;s order came as a huge relief: $100,000 for a library land purchase; $100,000 in aid to the police and fire departments; $100,000 for a town gazebo; $25,000 for the local Council on Aging; $20,000 to help close the public library&#8217;s budget; and $250,000 for a flooding study in the Bestick Road area.&#8221;</p>
<p>Granted, the reader is allowed to draw his/her own conclusion of Patrick v. Romney from the blog post entitled &#8220;No gazebo left behind.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Now, would you expect that somewhere on the post, or if not in the post itself, at least <a href="http://search.blogger.com/?as_q=romney&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;ui=blg&#038;bl_url=gregmankiw.blogspot.com&#038;x=77&#038;y=3">somewhere in the blog</a>, there would be some sort of a mention of the economist&#8217;s affiliation with Romney?  </p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/something-wicked-this-way-comes.html">Neither did I</a>.</p>
<p>Update:  Reader Raghav points out that Romney did have <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/advisers-to-mitt.html">a post indicating he had become an advisor to Romney</a>.  For whatever reason, it did not come up when I did a search on his blog using &#8220;Romney&#8221; as a search term.  That said, I should have done a more thorough search.  As I&#8217;ve noted before, I think Mankiw is extremely competent and knows what he&#8217;s doing &#8211; I just don&#8217;t like what it seems to me he chooses to do with his skills and his knowledge. </p>
<p>My apologies to Greg Mankiw.  A regular reader of his blog would have seen the post a month and a half ago in which he indicates his ties to Romney.</p>
<p>Update 2:  Something really wierd is going on&#8230; For some reason, last night when I wrote this story, when I ran a search at Greg Mankiw&#8217;s blog using &#8220;Romney&#8221; as the key word, three stories came up.  None was the one mentioning Mankiw was now an advisor to Romney.  This morning, I ran the same search, and there are now four stories &#8211; the addition being the story in which Mankiw mentions that he was hired by Romney.  I checked the file where I save screenshots to make sure its not just my faulty memory and its not just my imagination.  The story from back in late November that I did not find yesterday is now at the top.  Anyone have any idea how the blogger search function works and why something like this would happen?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article2132569.ece"> Danny Fortson, Andrew Murray-Watson and Tim Webb</a> report on a law that is about to come before the Iraqi parliament:<br />
<blockquote>Iraq&#8217;s massive oil reserves, the third-largest in the world, are about to be thrown open for large-scale exploitation by Western oil companies under a controversial law which is expected to come before the Iraqi parliament within days. The US government has been involved in drawing up the law, a draft of which has been seen by The Independent on Sunday. It would give big oil companies such as BP, Shell and Exxon 30-year contracts to extract Iraqi crude and allow the first large-scale operation of foreign oil interests in the country since the industry was nationalised in 1972.  The huge potential prizes for Western firms will give ammunition to critics who say the Iraq war was fought for oil. They point to statements such as one from Vice-President Dick Cheney, who said in 1999, while he was still chief executive of the oil services company Halliburton, that the world would need an additional 50 million barrels of oil a day by 2010. &#8220;So where is the oil going to come from?&#8230; The Middle East, with two-thirds of the world&#8217;s oil and the lowest cost, is still where the prize ultimately lies,&#8221; he said. Oil industry executives and analysts say the law, which would permit Western companies to pocket up to three-quarters of profits in the early years, is the only way to get Iraq&#8217;s oil industry back on its feet after years of sanctions, war and loss of expertise. But it will operate through &#8220;production-sharing agreements&#8221; (or PSAs) which are highly unusual in the Middle East, where the oil industry in Saudi Arabia and Iran, the world&#8217;s two largest producers, is state controlled.  Opponents say Iraq, where oil accounts for 95 per cent of the economy, is being forced to surrender an unacceptable degree of sovereignty.  Proposing the parliamentary motion for war in 2003, Tony Blair denied the &#8220;false claim&#8221; that &#8220;we want to seize&#8221; Iraq&#8217;s oil revenues. He said the money should be put into a trust fund, run by the UN, for the Iraqis, but the idea came to nothing. The same year Colin Powell, then Secretary of State, said: &#8220;It cost a great deal of money to prosecute this war. But the oil of the Iraqi people belongs to the Iraqi people; it is their wealth, it will be used for their benefit. So we did not do it for oil.&#8221;  Supporters say the provision allowing oil companies to take up to 75 per cent of the profits will last until they have recouped initial drilling costs. After that, they would collect about 20 per cent of all profits, according to industry sources in Iraq. But that is twice the industry average for such deals.  Greg Muttitt, a researcher for Platform, a human rights and environmental group which monitors the oil industry, said Iraq was being asked to pay an enormous price over the next 30 years for its present instability. &#8220;They would lose out massively,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because they don&#8217;t have the capacity at the moment to strike a good deal.&#8221; Iraq&#8217;s Deputy Prime Minister, Barham Salih, who chairs the country&#8217;s oil committee, is expected to unveil the legislation as early as today. &#8220;It is a redrawing of the whole Iraqi oil industry [to] a modern standard,&#8221; said Khaled Salih, spokesman for the Kurdish Regional Government, a party to the negotiations. The Iraqi government hopes to have the law on the books by March.  Several major oil companies are said to have sent teams into the country in recent months to lobby for deals ahead of the law, though the big names are considered unlikely to invest until the violence in Iraq abates.  James Paul, executive director at the Global Policy Forum, the international government watchdog, said: &#8220;It is not an exaggeration to say that the overwhelming majority of the population would be opposed to this. To do it anyway, with minimal discussion within the [Iraqi] parliament is really just pouring more oil on the fire.&#8221;  Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman and a former chief economist at Shell, said it was crucial that any deal would guarantee funds for rebuilding Iraq. &#8220;It is absolutely vital that the revenue from the oil industry goes into Iraqi development and is seen to do so,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Although it does make sense to collaborate with foreign investors, it is very important the terms are seen to be fair.&#8221; James Paul, executive director at the Global Policy Forum, the international government watchdog, said: &#8220;It is not an exaggeration to say that the overwhelming majority of the population would be opposed to this.

<p>The oil companies do appear to be getting a very good deal for this.  Now one could argue that Iraq needs to do this given the current instability, but let’s recall how the current unstable situation was created.</p>

<blockquote>California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who once taunted Democrats as &#8220;girlie men,&#8221; called Friday for an end to partisan bickering and a focus on innovative centrist policies. In a elaborately staged inaugural that included singers breaking into choruses of &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; right after he took the oath of office, Schwarzenegger said California could serve as a model to the rest of the country and larger world. &#8220;At one time, the greatest public policy innovations came from liberals, such as during the New Deal,&#8221; the Republican celebrity said. &#8220;Then the most innovative ideas came from conservatives, such as Ronald Reagan.</p></blockquote>
<p>The New Deal is code for spend &#038; spend and Reagan is code for borrow &#038; borrow.  Schwarzenegger wants to pretend the government can increase spending without increasing taxes.  But he is following the model of the past six years in Washington, D.C. known as Bush’s fiscal policy.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/01/no-gazebo-left-behind.html">Greg Mankiw</a> finds more spend and borrow in <br /><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/01/07/patricks_reversal_of_cuts_brings_joy">Massachusetts</a>:<br />
<blockquote>With Deval Patrick now in the corner office on Beacon Hill, officials and community leaders south of Boston are applauding his decision to restore budget cuts made by former governor Mitt Romney.  The restored cuts statewide amount to $383.6 million &#8230; The money was cut in November, when Romney, invoking his so-called 9C authority, used emergency fiscal powers to slash $450 million from the state budget, blaming the Legislature for a spending crisis. He later restored some of the cuts.  Patrick said last month that the $383.6 million in cuts hurt thousands of poor people across the state and that he would restore them. Since then, aides to Patrick said the state faces a deficit that could reach $1 billion this year.  Some expressed skepticism about Patrick&#8217;s pledge and ability to restore the cuts.  &#8220;He declared there&#8217;s a $1 billion gap and reversed $400 million in cuts,&#8221; said David G. Tuerck, executive director of the Beacon Hill Institute, a conservative economic think tank. &#8220;It puzzles me how he can do both.&#8221;  But Michael J. Widmer, executive director of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said he did not see a problem. Widmer, who worked as a volunteer co-chairman on a transition committee that studied budget issues for Patrick, said Romney was wrong to make the cuts in the first place because there was no fiscal crisis.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Widmer is saying there is no fiscal crisis – suppose he’s not correct.  Will Governor Patrick propose a tax increase or will he borrow and pander like our California governor?</p>

                                <p>As I listened to this evening’s McLaughlin Group, Tony Blankley was showing all what a bunch of cynical bastards the Bush Republicans really are.  I was going to let it all go but then I saw the usually sensible <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/01/escalation_in_i.html">Mark Thoma</a> quibbling with something <a href="http://robertreich.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-dems-wont-stop-bushs-surge-in-iraq.html">Robert Reich</a> wrote.  First up is Robert:<br />
<blockquote>As long as Dems remain opposed to Bush’s policies and the Democratic leadership offers some semblance of unity in opposition – while at the same time giving Bush the money he wants to carry out his policies – the Dem candidate in 2008 can blame Bush and the Republicans, and no Republican candidate who supports Bush will have a comeback. McCain’s strategy of distancing himself from Bush by arguing for more troops is about to backfire on him, because he’s going to get what he wants – and America will see just how tragically wrong he is (Edwards has already, adeptly, labeled it the &#8220;McCain doctrine.&#8221;) Yet wouldn’t it be extraordinary if the Dems didn’t play this political game, and refused to fund Bush’s &#8220;surge&#8221;?</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark seems bothered by this cynical nature of these political calculations:<br />
<blockquote>With lives at stake, it feels uncomfortable making decisions based upon political calculations. If I had a family member serving in Iraq, I wouldn&#8217;t give a damn who was president next or how blame gets apportioned except to the extent that it affected the ultimate outcome of this (literally) ill-advised war and holds people accountable as appropriate.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is hard to disagree with the sentiments here, but I think Mark is being terribly naïve.  Here was my comment to Mark’s post:<br />
<blockquote>Tony Blankley on the McLaughlin Group was laying the rightwing partisan claim that the next two years of the Iraq mess will be the Democrats fault. Why &#8211; because they have the power to cut off funding but not the guts &#8211; according to the reprehensible former advisor of Newt the Pewt. Something tells me this is the Karl Rove master plan. Continue the Iraq disaster to put the Democrats into the Faustian position of abandoning the troops or owning Bush&#8217;s folly.</p></blockquote>
<p>No – the Bush Administration is the one who is putting our soldiers in harm’s way for the most cynical of political calculations.  But he is Commander in Chief (unless someone has the courage and power to impeach him).  I hope the morality of those on the left doesn’t let us be so naïve that the Tony Blankley-Newt Gingrich-Karl Rove-Dick Cheney-George Bush wing of the Republican Party play us for fools and further sacrifice the future of our nation.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Greg Mankiw includes <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0104/p09s02-coop.html">Donald Boudreaux</a> on his reading list.  Now I’d be all in favor of a good letter telling Lou Dobbs that his trade protectionist rants should not be listened to by any policy maker, but this is not the letter that one should send:<br />
<blockquote>First, some basic facts about the state of middle-class Americans. The US unemployment rate now is at a healthy 4.5 percent. This rate is lower than the average annual unemployment rate for the 1970s (6.2 percent), the 1980s (7.3 percent), and even the high-growth 1990s (5.6 percent). Inflation, meanwhile, is running below the average for the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Here&#8217;s more good news for ordinary Americans. The percentage of Americans who own their own homes is higher than ever, even though the size of today&#8217;s typical home is larger than ever. Workers&#8217; leisure time, too, is at historically high levels. And jobs are just as secure today as they were in the late 1960s, according to a research paper by University of California-Davis economist Ann Huff Stevens.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the most part – this is the standard Karl Rove rant.  But if workers have more leisure time – doesn’t that mean we have moved down the labor supply curve as opposed to the usual supply-side claim that Bush’s tax cuts encouraged more work not less?  Boudreaux finally gets around to the trade deficit:<br />
<blockquote>Admittedly, the word &#8220;deficit&#8221; sounds ominous. In fact, though, America&#8217;s trade deficit is evidence of its economic vigor and promise. Here&#8217;s why: When Americans buy foreign-made goods and services, foreigners earn dollars. The only way America would run no trade deficit is if foreigners spent all of these dollars buying goods and services from Americans. Instead, though, foreigners invest some of their dollars in America. They buy American corporate stock, they build their own factories and retail outlets in the US, they lend dollars to Uncle Sam, and they hold some dollars in reserve as cash. Aren&#8217;t you proud that so many people the world over eagerly invest their hard-earned wealth in America? As an American, I&#8217;m proud and optimistic. Foreigners invest in the US so readily because its economy is so strong. And even better, these investments strengthen the economy by creating more capital for American workers. These investments raise workers&#8217; productivity and wages. Remember: A trade deficit is not synonymous with debt. I&#8217;m writing this letter on a new Sony computer that I bought with cash. I owe Sony nothing. If Sony holds the dollars it earned from this sale, or if it uses these dollars to buy stock in General Electric or land in Arizona &#8211; that is, as long as Sony invests its dollars in America in ways other than lending it to Americans &#8211; the US trade deficit rises without raising Americans&#8217; indebtedness.  Americans go more deeply into debt to foreigners only when Americans borrow money from foreigners. Uncle Sam, of course, borrows a lot of money, from both Americans and from non-Americans. I share your concern about the reckless spending and borrowing practiced by politicians in Washington.</p></blockquote>
<p>I trust Professor Boudreaux understands that Federal debt is our deferred tax liabilities?  After all, his claim that we are not borrowing seems to rank with some of the dumbest things we’ve seen from the National Review.  Professor Boudreaux closes with:<br />
<blockquote>Smith correctly understood that with free trade, the economy becomes larger than any one nation &#8211; a fact that brings more human creativity, more savings, more capital, more specialization, more opportunity, more competition, and a higher standard of living to all those who can freely trade.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a nice general defense of free trade but when Professor Boudreaux suggests that the U.S. has more savings, he seems to be ignoring the evidence that our national savings rate has declined. Maybe Dr. Mankiw should have spent his time not reading this letter but writing a much better letter to Lou Dobbs.</p>
