                                <p>This morning, <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/002402.php">Chuck Hagel (R-NE) said this</a>: </p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever had a coherent strategy.</p>
<p>In fact, I would even challenge the administration today to show us the plan that the president talked about the other night. There is no plan.</p>
<p>I happen to know Pentagon planners were on their way to the Central Com over the weekend. They haven&#8217;t even team B&#8217;ed this plan.</p>
<p>And my dear friend Dick Lugar talks about coherence of strategy. There is no strategy. This is a ping-pong game with American lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, what I wonder is &#8211; 3 years into a disastrous war, would a senator who says  that the administration has never had a coherent strategy, that the administration has no plan for going forward (and lies about it), and plays ping-pong with the lives of our soldiers &#8211; would such a senator, could such a senator have any possible reason not to support or even champion the cause of impeaching the President of the United States?  If this isn&#8217;t cause for impeachment, what is?  What possibly can be?</p>

<p>I’ve received a couple of emails and comments regarding President Bush’s claim that 7.2 million new jobs have been created under his watch.  Since I couldn’t reach Jim Webb’s speechwriter this early in the morning, I’ve decided to graph the payroll survey from 2000 to 2006 and let the picture tell the story.  Sure, employment in December 2006 was 6.4 million higher than it was in September 2003.  However – when one compares employment as of December 2006 to employment as of December 2000, we see employment has grown by only 3.73 million.  I guess his speechwriters thought 52,000 new jobs per month didn’t sound dramatic enough.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader Ken Melvin emailed me something that got me thinking in terms of the household survey rather than the payroll survey – and in particular, the employment to population ratio (EP).  EP was 63.4% as of December 2006 and Ken’s thought process ran along these lines.  Suppose we benchmark employment growth by considering where it would be if we had retained that 64.7% EP as of April 2000.  BLS is reporting population to be 230.108 million as of December 2006 so the 1.3% difference in the current EP as compared to the April 2000 record represents almost 3 million lost jobs.  OK, maybe it’s a stretch to suggest the natural rate of EP should be its record observation.  But let’s suppose we assign a value to the natural rate of EP around 64% as I suggested a while back.  We’d still be 1.4 million jobs short of this natural rate.</p>

                                <p>A follow-up to my post yesterday afternoon.  I was reading the NRO this morning to see what the tough guys and realists thought about the SOTU.  (I didn&#8217;t hear it &#8211; the girlfriend and I purposely went for a walk at 6:00 PM PST.)  <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NmIyMDU3Nzk5ZjEwMWFkNDg3ZWIwYmY1NDAzNGI2NWU=">Mark Steyn did not disappoint</a>: </p>
<p>&#8220;You can argue that Iraq is not the most important part of the war but itÂ?s ludicrous to insist that itÂ?s no part of it at all. For one thing, any outcome that can be presented as a US defeat will be a huge boost for our enemies around the world, and be very revealing of our credibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Granted, he was talking about Webb&#8217;s response to the SOTU (and no, I didn&#8217;t hear that either).  But I wonder, if the US had invaded Costa Rica instead of Iraq and GW had managed to steer the campaign into a quagmire in Iraq, would Steyn&#8217;s analysis of the situation change?  Well, no.  After all, the enemies would still be emboldened by a US loss.  Therefore, I would like to humbly suggest that it would have made more sense to invade Costa Rica than Iraq.  Here are a few reasons:</p>
<p>1.  Costa Rica has no military.  None.  <br />2.  WMDs are no harder to find in Costa Rica than in Iraq<br />3.  More Americans speak the Costa Rican lingo (I understand its some sort of Mexican) than the Iraqi one.  That is also true of Americans in the military.<br />4.  Smaller population &#8211; less home grown insurgents<br />5.  Fewer bordering countries &#8211; less insurgents arriving.<br />6.  Closer to the US &#8211; logistics are cheaper.<br />7.  Active volcanoes &#8211; the place might be done in by a natural disaster anyway.<br />8.  Voracious man-eating beasts &#8211; the Costa Rican population is already under siege from these <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&#038;q=sloth%20costa%20rica&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;oe=UTF-8&#038;sa=N&#038;tab=wi">monstrous predators</a> with whom we can make an alliance.</p>
<p>The good news is that its not too late.  Right now the tough guys and the realists are girding their loins to give a good Ledeen doctrining to Iran.  (On the cheap, with a limited air campaign, of course &#8211; if the latte sipping goldbricking US soldiers had just left their airconditioned spas and gone after the bad guys like the tough guys and the realists told them to, all would be well.)  But there is little that can be gained by attacking Iran that can&#8217;t be gained attacking Costa Rica.  If anyone from the National Review crowd is reading this thing &#8211; can&#8217;t we just bomb the $% out of Costa Rica instead and save us some taxpayer money?</p>
<p>Update.  Note that I am not implying that Iran is not trying to get a bomb.  In fact, given the kid gloves toward North Korea, the invasion of non-threatening Iraq, and the now bellicose stance against them by the tough guys and realists, Iran&#8217;s leaders would be crazy not to try to develop one.  And eventually they will get one (5 years?  10?  It depends on how much they deal with the North Koreans and our good buddies in Pakistan.)  But after Osirak, they&#8217;d also be crazy to build it in such a way that the program could be taken out from the air, and a ground invasion is no longer an option to an administration that can&#8217;t even subdue Afghanistan.</p>

So did <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2007/01/23/from-the-president-a-two-letter-jab-at-the-democrats">Yochi J. Dreazen</a>, <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/012091.php">Josh Marshall</a>, and many media pundits.  But seriously – why would we care in light of the serial dishonesty from the President on <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/01/23/2007-sotu">fiscal policy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>First, we must balance the Federal budget. We can do so without raising taxes. What we need to do is impose spending discipline in Washington, D.C. We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009 &#8211; and met that goal 3 years ahead of schedule. Now let us take the next step. In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the Federal deficit within the next 5 years. I ask you to make the same commitment. Together, we can restrain the spending appetite of the Federal Government, and balance the Federal budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pardon my French – but this is crap.  The General Fund deficit has not declined and the notion that we can balance the budget without reversing his tax “cuts” is a lie.  Of course, the unified deficit is smaller but then we have this:<br />
<blockquote>Finally, to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlements. Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments of conscience &#8211; and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound. Yet we are failing in that duty &#8211; and this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts in benefits. Everyone in this Chamber knows this to be true &#8211; yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act. So let us work together and do it now. With enough good sense and good will, you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid &#8211; and save Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>Saving Social Security from this fiscally irresponsible President who seems hell bent to default on our Social Security obligations?  Such brazen hypocrisy!  No, he did not insult members of my party.  He insulted every American.</p>

<p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZmQ3OWE5NTkzNjA3NWJlYTFkMjI0OTA4ODMzMTEzM2U=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> does more of his Bush cheerleading on the “economic state of the union”:<br />
<blockquote>The fact is, jobs continue to boom. So do real incomes, productivity, and profits. Economist Michael Darda points out that real wages over the first five years of the Bush expansion are actually growing more rapidly than over the first five years of the Papa Bush/Bill Clinton boom.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems that Kudlow may have assisted in this part of Bush’s upcoming speech <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/01/23/2007-sotu">tonight</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy &#8211; and that is what we have. We are now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth &#8211; in a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs … so far. Unemployment is low, inflation is low, and wages are rising. This economy is on the move &#8211; and our job is to keep it that way, not with more government but with more enterprise.</p></blockquote>
<p>So all you workers who think your real compensation is not rising rapidly, let me tell you that you are just plain (time to check fact the man in the NRO clown suit again) RIGHT! Yes, I gave this away with my graph of real compensation from 1989 to 2006.  You see – real compensation did increase very much during the first half of the 1990’s. Mind you the productivity boom did increase real compensation quite dramatically from 1997 to 2003.  But since then – real compensation growth has been a crawl.  Of course if you trust Kudlow to provide you with the facts – is he the clown or are you?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: My apologies to our smart and honest readers but we have a new troll who is accusing yours truly of being dishonest for reporting the fact that real compensation over the past three years have not been increasing that quickly.  You see, this Nitish keeps hammering that I should have reported on real wages excluding fringe benefits.  I checked with the BLS series on real wages in 1982$.  BLS reported as of December 2003 that real wages were $8.31 and as of December 2006 were $8.34.  Yes, an increase of less than 0.4% over a three year period.  I rest my case!</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/012082.php">Josh Marshall</a> seems to have heard another whooper from the former RNC Chair:<br />
<blockquote>Here for instance is serial bamboozler and former RNC Chair Ed Gillespie just moments ago on MSNBC waxing poetic about President Bush&#8217;s plan to balance the budget by 2012 and claiming that the last time the budget was balanced was in 1998.  Unlike the more established Republican tradition of chat show lying, I&#8217;m not even sure what it is this goof is trying to hang his hat on with this whopper. Back on planet earth we know that the budget became balanced during the Clinton presidency and remained in balance until he left office in 2001.</p></blockquote>
<p>Josh points to <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/24/budgetsurplus.ap/index.html">this CNN story</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Flush with tax revenues from a booming economy, the federal government posted a record $237 billion surplus for the budget year that ended in September, the Clinton administration announced Tuesday … The official announcement of the 2000 surplus comes only two weeks before voters elect a new president. A major point of contention between Vice President Al Gore, the Democrats&#8217; presidential pick, and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republicans&#8217; choice, has been what should be done with surpluses that are projected to total $4.6 trillion over the next decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah – the good old days.  Table B-78 of the Economic Report of the President 2006 notes we had a unified surplus equal to $128 billion in 2001 as well.  Could Gillespie be thinking of the on-budget surplus?  But the on-budget account was not in surplus in 1998.  We had a very small surplus in 1999 and an $86 billion surplus in 2000.  But this account went back to deficits in 2001 with the expected deficit for this year being $543 billion.  Whether one uses the on-budget deficit or the even larger general fund deficit, we will not see a balanced budget by 2012 if we follow George W. Bush’s plans.</p>
<p>Josh also provides <a href="http://www.uuforum.org/deficit.htm">this link</a> to a cool graph of the unified surplus (deficit) from 1961 to 2006.  Notice the projections have the deficit rising.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>For the first time in many years, I’m not going to make any effort to watch or listen to the SOTU.  Why bother?  From an economic perspective, I’m still waiting for GW to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">fulfill promises from his capaign and from when he first took office</a>.  He won’t fulfill those, and everything else has just been a never-ending series of goal-post movements.  Sometimes there are claims of success following the movements, sometimes there aren’t, but from an economic perspective, anyone who understands the difference between “real” and “nominal” knows this administration doesn’t have any economic accomplishments to its credit.  </p>
<p>Then there’s Iraq.  There’s no point in recapitulating this mess again.  Sure, he’ll probably flesh out his plan, but its basically fire the foolish general who towed the GW line for 3 years, and promote some generals foolish enough to tow the new GW line until he runs out the clock.  </p>
<p>The rest of the SOTU will be made up of minor disasters of one sort or another.  Some stupid healthcare proposal that will benefit insurance companies and screw the insured, and potential the uninsured as well.  Some junior version of the Mars proposal of a few years back.  Whatever.</p>
<p>The only interesting thing will be Iran.  At the NRO, K Lo tells us <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ODljYTY3MDFiOGVmNTVjNmZkZDMyMmJkNDI3YzQ5YWY=">”Iran and Syria will be warned again tonight”</a>.  </p>
<p>Which reminded me of what another NRO denizen wrote the other day.  J Pod, one of the more intelligent members of the NRO community <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Y2UzNjlkNWZjZmJlZWIyMDgxOTdkZjE0NGQwNTc1OWI=">criticized those who claim GW is exagerating the Iran threat</a>.  As he notes, “when it comes to Iran&#8217;s WMD, once again, nobody is relying on intelligence to inform us that the Iranians are in full pursuit of nukes. Iran&#8217;s own president says it himself, constantly and repeatedly.”</p>
<p>Now, J Pod sometime seems to play a moron, but he isn’t one.  I assume he knows what is going on here.  This is very simple game theory.  The President and the cheerleaders in the NRO/Weekly Standard crowd consider themselves to be realists and tough guys.  They believe in things like the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg042302.asp">Ledeen doctrine</a>  (i.e., &#8220;Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall, just to show the world we mean business&#8221;).  </p>
<p>So moving troops around, hopefully into harm’s way, is how this crowd looks look tough and realistic.  So where do they move those troops – which small little crappy country gets thrown against a wall?  (And bear in mind, a really realistic and tough President isn’t going to stop with just one small little crappy country.)</p>
<p>Well, the President did name an Axis of Evil.  Iraq, the weakest of the three, was the obvious starting point.  North Korea – best avoided at all costs – they’ve got nukes.</p>
<p>Now, what’s the message to the rest of the world?  Well, the US won’t mess with you if you got nukes.  Now, Iran got the message, so they’re screaming right and left that not only do they have nukes, by golly they’re itching to use them.  But everyone else got the message too.  After a while, it sinks in with the smarter Corner residents that the end result of this will be a world with lots of small little crappy countries that have nukeelar weapons.  (I’m sure someone explained it to GW too.)  And where is the Ledeen doctrine then?</p>
<p>So… the logical thing, from the perspective of realists and tough guys, is to hit Iran.  Make it clear you believe they have WMDs and that you’re willing to hit them anyway.  (Of course, it would be necessary to <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OGYwOTVjNjdkNTA1ZmRmMThhNjAwMzJkZmRlYTZiZTg=">use more appropriate jargon</a>).  Do it right and those small little crappy countries will realize that even a joker won’t save you from the Ledeen doctrine.  </p>
<p>Sadly for the realists and tough guys…  the Iraq adventure has not gone so well.  The troops, the ones who should have been available to go into Iran, are goldbricking in Iraq.  As Ledeen himself tells us, many of them are <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTYxZDcxMzkzNzhiMzFkNTAwMzkxNjE0Y2FkNmM0MTE=">“sitting in air-conditioned quarters and drinking designer coffee”</a>, and simply saying “[e]nough of that” won’t solve the problem.  </p>
<p>But as Condi Rice said the other day, a problem is also an opportunity.  If the troops aren’t there to invade Iran, it only means they won’t get bogged down “sitting in air-conditioned quarters and drinking designer coffee” in Iran.  The tough guys and realists realize – you don’t have to invade Iran to show you’re tough.  Hit them from the air and you accomplish the same thing:</p>
<p>1a.  Since they don’t WMDs anyway, hitting them from the air won&#8217;t be any less effective at eliminating their WMDs than occupying them<br />1b. It will reduce the pesky questions that would otherwise come a few years later (&#8220;where are them nukes y&#8217;all talked about?&#8221;)<br />2.  You don’t even have go through the effort of learning how to tell yet another group of towelheads apart.</p>
<p>Talk about win-win-win.</p>
<p>The question is… do the Iranians see this?  Are they playing along?  I have no idea.  And I have work to do.  Your thoughts?</p>
<p>Update.  Clearly this thing needed some editing.  I rewrote parts of it to make it more legible.  Apologies.</p>

                                <p>Robert McTeer writes a Wall Street Journal op-ed that seems to suggest we can expand the money supply with no fear of hitting a full employment constraint:<br />
<blockquote>The main question on financial TV lately has been whether the economy will continue to weaken and possibly slip into recession, but allow inflation to decelerate, or whether it will pick up and cause inflation to accelerate. More slack in the economy, or a larger output gap, would reduce inflation; more output, it is presumed, would make inflation worse. While a weaker economy might well reduce inflation, that isn&#8217;t a necessary condition. Faster growth can also reduce inflation &#8230; The Phillips Curve is rarely mentioned anymore, but it still pervades the common view that inflation can be tamed only through a weaker economy. Disinflationary growth is not considered an option, probably because we think of output as responding only passively to changes in aggregate demand, so that they rise together or fall together.  That may be the usual case, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. Supply-side factors may stimulate output independent of aggregate demand, through shifts in investment, exports or shifts from imports to domestically produced goods. Or animal spirits … Supply-side economics is out of favor at universities that don&#8217;t have good football teams. But that&#8217;s largely because its bar for success has been raised too high. Tax-rate cuts may not fully pay for themselves at current rate levels, but they certainly have gone a long way in that direction, as the recent sharp decline in the budget deficit despite rapid spending growth clearly indicates. Tax-rate cuts that substantially pay for themselves in higher tax revenue are clearly a good thing. Our economy is remarkably healthy. Inflation has crept above our comfort zone, but current policies are bringing it down without a recession. Monetary policy is just about right, and is being helped in its fight against inflation by other factors: the Internet, globalization, China, India and other new players. Let&#8217;s not be afraid of growth.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/archives/000915.html">Brad DeLong</a> takes us back to September 25, 2002 with <em>The WSJ&#8217;s Take on the Current Attitude of the Fed</em>:<br />
<blockquote>Greg Ip and E.S. Browning of the Wall Street Journal sketch out their take on the current attitude of the Federal Reserve. It seems to be that short-term interest rates are already so low that spending has to recover and grow sometime in the future &#8230; Reflecting the difficulties the central bank faces, two policy makers &#8211; Gov. Edward Gramlich and Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert McTeer &#8211; broke with Chairman Greenspan and their other colleagues, publicly declaring themselves in favor of a rate cut. It was the first dissent in favor of cutting rates since 1995. Mr. Gramlich&#8217;s vote is especially noteworthy. Since joining the Fed in 1997, the former academic has developed a reputation for urging more aggressive action on both raising rates and lowering them, but he has never felt strongly enough to dissent. His decision indicates a strong conviction that the economy needs help quickly. By contrast, Mr. McTeer has long had a reputation as a dove, dissenting twice in favor of not raising rates in 1999.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given how strong the economy was back in 1999, I cannot understand how any member of the FED could have disagreed with the interest rate increase back then.  Alas, <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj21n2/cj21n2-6.pdf">McTeer</a> has doubted the existence of a full employment constraint for years:<br />
<blockquote>I mention this because I think the chairman’s and the FOMC’s finest hours in recent years were their decisions not to tighten during the period when growth exceeded previous speed limits and when unemployment fell below previous estimates of the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). The committee, in effect, was testing the growth limits of the New Economy. I just wanted to continue the testing a little longer … By elite opinion, I mean the opinion of traditional establishment types who attended universities that don’t have good football teams and who have a large investment, either literally or intellectually, in the Old Economy. Fortunately, I had no such investment and wasn’t too proud to look at the economy as well as models of the economy. In the equation of exchange, MV = PQ, note that solving for prices puts Q in the denominator, not the numerator: P = MV/Q. Other things equal, more Q means a lower P. Most policymakers ignore that because they’re used to taking Q as a given and focusing on effective demand, or MV. Many who might flinch at being called Keynesians seem to believe more in Keynes’ law &#8211; that demand creates its own supply &#8211; than Say’s law &#8211; that supply creates its own demand. It seems to me that both are valid. Those who ignore Q’s denominator status probably assume that it has no life of its own. Output responds passively to demand. I’m not so sure about that. It seems to me that the 1990s were chock-full of supply-side, Q-altering events: the collapse of communism and hardcore socialism; privatization and deregulation all over the world; freer trade and capital flows; more efficient financial markets; an explosion of high-tech invention, innovation, and deployment; venture capital to finance high tech; better monetary policies; budget deficits turning into surpluses; the proliferation of tiny computer chip brains in everything, everywhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>McTeer certainly likes football analogies! Sure – there may be real business cycle events that increase full employment output – but that does not invalidate the Phillips curve notion that excessive aggregate demand growth during a period when we are near full employment will lead to accelerating inflation.  If the Federal Reserve believed back then that aggregate demand growth was becoming excessive, then the prudent course would have been to raise interest rates.  If the Federal Reserve believes that we are currently approaching a period of excess aggregate demand (full disclosure – I would not agree with such a view just yet), then the prudent course would still be to raise interest rates.  Thankfully, Robert McTeer is not serving on the Federal Reserve at this time.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>An AB reader alerts us to an interesting story from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/business/23lotto.html">Charles Duhigg and Jenny Anderson</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The state of Illinois yesterday took the first steps in selling its state lottery system, hoping to attract as much as $10 billion from investors who, in return, would own a monopoly that could turn out to be the biggest jackpot yet. The sale, which may occur as early as the spring, would not be the first privatization of public property &#8211; both Chicago and Indiana have recently earned billions of dollars by signing long-term leases with private companies to run toll roads. But the proposed lottery sale is almost certain be one of the largest privatizations of a state-run program, and it raises concerns that states, some of them critically short of cash, are selling valuable assets that could otherwise provide consistent streams of revenue. Under the proposed sale, Illinois would receive a multibillion-dollar one-time payment, and the lottery’s new owners would receive all revenue and profit for 75 years. Indiana is also considering selling its lottery, and bids are due later this month. That sale is expected to raise more than $1 billion upfront and annual payments of $200 million. Midway Airport in Chicago, toll roads in Pennsylvania and the New Jersey Turnpike are all potentially on the block.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what are the business considerations here?  If the present value of expected future profits exceed the price received by the state – then these are bad deals for taxpayers. I bet some folks will say that there is some efficiency gain to be had by privatization:<br />
<blockquote>Illinois officials say selling the lottery, which collected revenue of about $2 billion and profits around $630 million last year, will give the business marketing and technological heft that the government cannot now provide.  “This is fundamentally a retail business, and governments are not equipped to manage retail businesses,” said John Filan, the chief operating officer of the state of Illinois. “Gaming is getting so competitive around the world that we’re worried our revenues could go down unless there is retail expertise.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone wish to challenge this premise?<br />
<blockquote>Opponents of lottery privatization disagree. They argue that many states, including California, New York and Florida, have hired companies like GTech, of Providence, R.I., to run their lotteries, gaining private-industry expertise without selling a valuable asset. Despite its public ownership, Illinois increased its lottery’s revenue by more than 15 percent from 2003 to 2005, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. “These are very healthy businesses,” said Melissa Kearney, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Maryland. “It’s unclear exactly what is gained by selling a lottery, except for a huge pot of money that legislators can start spending right away.”  Other critics say there is also a risk of selling the lottery for too little. “If it turns out this thing is worth more than $10 billion, then they’ve denied future citizens hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues just so they can temporarily plug a hole in the dike,” said Dave Schulz, director of the Infrastructure Technology Institute at Northwestern University and Chicago’s budget director in the mid-1980s.</p></blockquote>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I am putting in my 2 cents by illustrating how the debate looks to me – someone who started paying Social Security just about exactly at the time the Greenspan Commission raised the tax rate.  That makes me (and my huge cohort of same-age people) the person most likely to be adversely affected by some of the proposals currently out there for “reforming” the Social Security system.</p>
<p>First, lets recognize what FDR did back in the 1930’s.  He wanted to provide a benefit for then-old people who didn’t have any savings, but he didn’t want to make anyone have to pay twice.  That is, since the old folks of the 1930’s couldn’t fund themselves (since they were old already) the only other people around to pay up were the working age people of the 1930’s.  How to make them pay for somebody other than themselves?  Promise an “intergenerational compact” in which they too would be paid by working age people when they got to be old enough to retire.  That way everybody got a Social Security check and nobody had to pay more than once.</p>
<p>But FDR didn’t reckon with the Baby Boom.  By 1983 it was clear that the system would run into problems when the huge cohort of which I am a part retired.  There wouldn’t be enough money in the system to pay them so the Greenspan commission raised SS taxes more than enough to pay the retirees of the 1980’s, 1990’s, 2000’s and 2010’s.  The system accumulated surpluses which it lends to the Federal General Fund and which will fund us baby boomers when we retire.  </p>
<p>Note well three points:</p>
<p>1. The 1980’s, 1990’s, 2000’s and 2010’s are almost exactly the whole of my working life.</p>
<p>2.  During that period I have been paying (or will pay) SS taxes that paid or will pay for the retirees of the 1980’s, 1990’s, 2000’s and 2010’s.</p>
<p>3. During that period I have ALSO been paying extra SS taxes that are intended as a surplus out of which I (and my cohorts) will have our OWN retirements funded.</p>
<p>That means that I and my Baby Boomer buddies are the ONLY generation that has been stuck twice.  We have paid for the retirements of the old people who were old while we were working AND we have paid extra to prefund our own retirement.</p>
<p>I have to say that I was unhappy – to put it mildly – to have to pay huge SS taxes back in my 20’s to support my grandparents in a lifestyle that was many times more affluent than what I could afford at that time.  But that is nothing to how unhappy I will be if the government reneges on its intergenerational compact to me and not only makes me pay twice but cuts the benefit to me just when it is my turn.</p>
<p>There is no reason for the Federal Government to pick on me and my SS expectations as the particular expenditure that is breaking the back of the fiscal soundness of the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">USA</place></country-region>.  Any other expenditure or revenue cut can be pointed at as the straw that broke this camel’s back.  My own choices for the straw that broke this  camel’s back are exorbitant defense expenditures,  tax cuts for the rich, and medical expenses.  But the basic point is that I have already paid my “share” twice and will be sure to communicate this to any politician who asks for my vote.</p></p>
