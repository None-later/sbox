                                                                    </div>

                                <p>In my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/company-town-century-later.html">post on the Company Town</a> from yesterday, I mentioned a scam perpetrated on young people.  OkieLawyer had a comment I found interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember when I first started practicing law, I had a potential case involving the group here in Oklahoma. When I investigated them, I found out that the people who owned the businesses kept creating new corporations every few months &#8212; seemingly staying one step ahead of the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>That got me thinking about Enron&#8230;  much of their deception involved moving debts and losses into other corporations, making Enron look much more profitable than it was.  </p>
<p>The two situations &#8211; the one OkieLawyer mentions, and Enron, have a few things in common, but one is the creation of a large number of corporations when an honest business would not have had a need to create more than one or two.  I&#8217;ve had occasion to create one or two in the past few years myself&#8230; I have a pretty good idea of what they&#8217;re useful for, and I can&#8217;t see any reason for even a particularly entrepreneurial individual to create more than one or two a year &#8211; in a busy year &#8211; a person can pay attention to only so many things at a time.</p>
<p>Is the creation of a large number of corporations (large being some X for an individual and some Y for Fortune 500 company, where Y > X) a sign that funny business &#8211; either something illegal or some form of Large Accounting Firm enabled tax evasion &#8211; is being perpetrated?  Should there be limits to the number of corporations a person or other entity can create over a short period of time?</p>

<blockquote>it would be useful if we stopped pretending or alleging that China&#8217;s exchange-rate policies are the root cause of our trade deficit. If our savings rate is stubbornly stuck below our investment rate, and if China does allow its currency to revalue over time, then we will simply run a deficit with another collection of countries, and from a domestic point of view, nothing much will have changed. Except that we won&#8217;t have this subject to discuss with China anymore.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this sounds like a few comments from certain Angrybears, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/01/in_condemnation.html">Brad DeLong</a> has an objection:<br />
<blockquote>One-equation economics assumes that certain economic quantities are fixed in stone, examines one equation &#8211; usually an accounting identity &#8211; and concludes that somebody else&#8217;s preferred policies will be ineffective and counterproductive. It does so by ignoring the fact that one of the aims or effects of the somebody else&#8217;s policies will be to change the values of the economic quantities that are&#8211;by assumption and only by assumption &#8211; claimed to be fixed in stone.</p></blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of a debate that fellow Angrybear, Steve Kyle, and I were having with Dean Baker.  The real insight came for <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2006/12/more-cause-and-effect-regarding.html">Kash</a> where he kindly credits the following to me:<br />
<blockquote>one can really think of this is a question of cause and effect (otherwise known as a chicken-or-the-egg debate). Would a cheaper dollar induce higher savings, thus bringing about the needed change to the US&#8217;s savings/investment balance that would reduce the CA deficit? Or would an improvement in US savings cause the dollar to lose value, thus inducing US exports to rise and imports to fall and thereby improving the CA deficit? Obviously, exchange rates and domestic consumption/savings behavior are both jointly and simultaneously determined. But if I had to pick one to be more exogenous, I would vote for savings behavior. I think that the US&#8217;s underlying savings/investment balance has a lot more influence over the dollar exchange rate than the other way around. Dean suggests the opposite, and specifically argues that because the weak yuan has entailed the Chinese central bank buying lots of dollars, the Chinese exchange rate policy has effectively kept interest rates low in the US, which in turn has depressed savings.</p></blockquote>
<p>One can read the rest of Kash’s excellent discussion, which links back to where Dean takes on a couple of Angrybears.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/171476">Brad Setser</a> weighs in on this debate with a detailed review of the data as well as suggestions that the U.S. savings rate is not as exogenous as Spence, Kash, and yours truly may have argued.</p>

                                <p>With hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/01/same_old_same_o.html">Mark Thoma</a>, our conservative friend <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://bartlett.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/bush-recycles-the-trash">Bruce Bartlett</a> has said something incredibly sensible that directly contradicts the free lunch supply-side idiocy that often comes out of President Bush’s mouth:<br />
<blockquote>However, if you ask most economists, they will more than likely say that the robust growth we have today is simply due to the normal workings of the business cycle &#8211; what goes down eventually goes up again. If any governmental action deserves credit, it would be the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. &#8230; The tax cuts undoubtedly raised the growth rate slightly, but at most their effect amounted to only tenths of a percent of the gross domestic product. onsequently, there is no possible way that the tax cuts can be credited with raising federal revenues, as Bush implies. &#8230; No serious person believes that across-the-board tax cuts of the sort that Bush proposed ever recoup 100 percent of their gross cost. Not even Bush’s own economists. &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sitting here thinking is there is anyway I could rephrase this to improve what it says.  I can’t.  It’s like Bruce read my mind and proceeded to write prose that I wish I had said!</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Long time readers may recall that I recently moved in with my girlfriend – she of the cheapest rent in all of LA.  Actually, the guy downstairs pays even less…  either one day the guy who owns the building will wake up from a coma, or we’ll find out there’s toxic waste stored in the floorboards, but so far so good&#8230; except for the cats &#8211; they don&#8217;t all getting along. </p>
<p>The new (for me, anyway) pad is in Silver Lake, kind of a bohemian area close to downtown.  It’s a great place to jog… lots of hills, and lots of staircases.  (Aside &#8211; as an early riser, I’ve learned that in LA, even moving a few miles means you see a different variety of wildlife if you jog before dawn – this area seems to favor skunks for whatever reason.)  </p>
<p>Lately, there’s been a different variety of critter coming around.  The last three days in a row, we’ve had teenagers stop at our door.  They all work for the same organization, and have the same pitch… they’re selling magazines and trying to win some sort of a contest.  The last couple of days I talked to whoever knocked, and ended up giving them money to get off the porch and leave me alone so I could get back to work to make some money to give it to people who knock on the front door.  (Wait… that can’t possibly be right.)</p>
<p>My girlfriend – she’s more the scrappy small business type than I – got disgusted at how easily I was pushed over and decided that if someone knocked today, she’d talk to them.  And sure enough, someone stopped by.</p>
<p>Anyway, she listened to the boy’s spiel, and then starting asking questions.  It seems this particular kid was from someplace in North Carolina – the company takes these kids from town to town.  They’re dropped off in a neighborhood and told to sell.  (It seems kind of unsafe to me.)  Judging from the fact that they’ve hit our apartment 3 times in 3 days, they haven’t planned this all that well either.  Anyway, each kid gets a percentage of what he/she sell, and the company puts their money away in a bank account for them until they leave the company.  (They stay for the length of one or more “contests.”)  The owner of the company – who drops them all off in the morning – told them he started this way and is now a multi-millionaire, and clearly the kids dream of doing the same.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out the kid who showed up today (and I assume he’s typical) is working from 9 to 9 six days a week, not counting the morning meeting or pep talk or whatever it was called.  That’s 12 hours a day…   He gets $20 a day for food (which may or may not be coming out of his sales – he wasn’t sure) and he’s making about $300 a week for the sales he makes.  Assuming he’s not being docked for his $20 a day food bill (which I suspect he actually is), that means he’s receiving $140 a week for food, plus $300 a week for sales commission, or a total of $440 a week.  Divide that by 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, and he’s making $6.11 an hour.  I believe minimum wage in California is $7.50 an hour, with premium pay required for working more than 8 hours in one day or at a stretch.</p>
<p>The new company town travels.  And it takes advantage of kids… it puts them in unsafe conditions, makes it hard for them to leave (leave at the end of the contest and supposedly the company pays your fare home, but if you leave before you pay your own fare home, and I would bet things are worked out so that no kid ever works near home), underpays them, and it keeps them going on promises of wealth that I would strongly suspect don’t materialize.  I wouldn’t be surprised if at the end of the process, each kid finds he owes the company money.  The $20 a day for meals will come out of the kid’s sales, and I’m sure housing and transportation from one city to another costs money.  Its easy to say the kids should know better – perhaps these kids should have paid more attention in school, but that doesn’t excuse taking advantage of them.</p>
<p>Anyway, my girlfriend explained all this to the boy, helped him figure out what he’s making per hour (in the best case scenario), and then told him to get himself on a bus home and find another job.  (LA is not the place for a naïve teenager far from home – if he stays around here he’ll be turning tricks on Sunset in 3 months, if he’s lucky.)  She also handed him some money.  What a pushover.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MTBmMjk4MjI2YWRmMzIwMWVmZWExNmIxZDcxNWRhYjg=">Mallory Factor</a> wants to join in the chorus of Pelosi critiques.  After all, Nancy Pelosi has been Speaker for how many years and there has been so little progress?  Did I say years – try hours and PAYGO is back over the objections of those spend and borrow Republicans.  But Mr. Factor is worried about the imminent threat that some projections of Social Security reserves might turn negative in two or three generations.  Heavens – what do we tell the children?  </p>
<p>But here is the entirety of Mr. Factor’s attack on Speaker Pelosi:<br />
<blockquote>The Democrats long ago staked out an uncompromising position on Social Security that took the president’s call for private accounts off the table. That leaves only two options: increase taxes or cut benefits &#8211; or, more likely, both.</p></blockquote>
<p>But let’s suppose we Democrats did not take privatization off the table.  There would still be only two options for reducing some expected future shortfall as privatization does not create one penny of wealth.  Of course, the free lunch crowd over at the National Review never bothered to take Finance 101 so they won’t get the basics.  </p>
<p>But then Mr. Mallory also turned into a liberal Keynesian further down in his ill informed rant:<br />
<blockquote>increasing the payroll tax by only 1.89 percent would reduce potential employment by 277,000 jobs per year, on average, over the next ten years. Raising the payroll tax would harm lower-income earners the most. Many Americans already pay more in payroll taxes than in federal taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Long-term fiscal responsibility does not reduce long-term growth even if the Laugher Curve nitwits at the National Review keep saying it does.  But I too am concerned that public policy under the Bush Administration is trying to shift taxation away from general income taxation and towards employment taxes.  So if Mr. Mallory is in favor of raising the income tax rate for the well to do to avoid increasing payroll taxes, we welcome him to the Democratic Party! Now go invite Speaker Pelosi to lunch and work out a bipartisan compromise.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Someone needs to help <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTk0ODMzYzA1MDAzMGI4OWUyMzk4OWY3MmMzZDU5NmQ=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> understand our Constitution:<br />
<blockquote>Yesterday&#8217;s package of new rules to govern the lower chamber erases the three-fifths majority that was required to raise taxes under the old Republican House rules.  The new rules allow tax hikes through a simple majority vote.  This is a bad sign.  I wonder if today&#8217;s stock market decline isn&#8217;t picking up this high tax threat.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK Larry, let’s walk you over the process very slowly.  Let’s suppose Charles Rangel pushes through a tax increase in the Ways and Means Committee.  And let’s suppose the House passes the legislation.  It’s not enacted unless the Senate also passes it.  And of course, President Bush could veto it.  I guess Larry is afraid Bush wants to sign a tax increase.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: Thanks to the AB reader for pointing us to <a href="http://www.policybytes.org/">IPI Policy Bytes</a> as both George Pieler and Tom Giovanetti claim PAYGO will reduce long-term growth.  It is truly amazing how certain rightwingers think reducing national savings promotes long-term growth.</p>
<p><strong>Update III</strong>:  When Mr. Factor said the Center for Data Analysis, he was referring to the Heritage Foundation and <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/SocialSecurity/cda05-04.cfm">this paper</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Weaken the U.S. economy by reducing the number of job opportunities and personal sav¬ings. By fiscal year (FY) 2015, the number of job opportunities lost would exceed 965,000, and personal savings (adjusted for inflation) would decline by more than $55 billion</p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, 965 thousand over ten years is nowhere close to 227 thousand per year.  Secondly, this is the calculation of the authors using what seems to be some Keynesian model.   I’m sorry – but an abuse of a Keynesian model by a group of Heritage hacks is rather pathetic.  But then Mr. Factor multiplies their bogus claim by a factor of three?  This is rather low even for the pages of the National Review.</p>

                                <p>Following in Brad de Long&#8217;s noble tradition of hoisting from comments, what follows are Bruce Webb&#8217;s comments to a PGL post from earlier today.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Public Dept just released <a href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/dfi/dfitrustfundreport.htm">Nov 30 balances in the OAS and DI Trust Funds</a></p>
<p>OAS (Survivor/Old Age)<br />$1,835,219,251,439.91<br />up just under $9 billion for the month.<br />DI (Disability)<br />$204,008,148,674.27<br />down about $200 million for the month.</p>
<p>How does that compare with year end projections from the 2006 Report?</p>
<p>Intermediate Cost OAS:<br />$1,833.7 billion<br />Low Cost OAS:<br />$1,834.6 billion</p>
<p>Intermediate Cost DI:<br />$201.6 billion<br />Low Cost DI:<br />$203.4 billion</p>
<p>So with a month to go we actually have more in the Trust Funds than either Intermediate Cost or fully funded Low Cost projected for the whole year. Perhaps we should spend less time on CBO projections for 2046 and more time on actual cash flows in the here and now. Social Security is just not broke.</p>
<p>cactus&#8217; note &#8211; I&#8217;m including the rest of his comment below, though it&#8217;s not quite so stand alone, relating more to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/dean-baker-on-deficit-relative-to-gdp.html">PGL&#8217;s discussion with Dean Baker</a>.  Still, it makes some points worth considering.  Bruce webb continues:</p>
<p>We have two economic models. One has a Social Security Trust Fund turning negative in 2017 and going to zero in 2041. The other has the General Fund having to pay a portion of the interest in that Trust Fund starting in 2023 but never driving the Trust Fund to depletion, instead having it rising to $60 trillion dollars in 2080 (Table VI.F8 2006 Report). Gigantic differences in output and yet if you examine projected year end balances between the two models you see less than $3 billion in input. Now in the real world we are on track to having about $10 billion plus in input. Now I don&#8217;t know how a continuing performance like this is going to change projected debt/GDP levels or inflection points, but change them they will. But it just seems to me that discussions of debt/GDP that simply build Intermediate Cost assumptions in are kind of ignoring the elephant in the room. Social Security is not an isolable issue, discussions of whether Bush deficits are affordable as a share of GDP or whether the yield curve inversion is a product of Dark Matter which ignore the very real possibility that Social Security will continue to be a net buyer of bonds in 2017 &#8211; or not &#8211; seem odd to me. Currently we are soundly beating Low Cost. What happens to your Debt/GDP models if we simply build Low Cost or Low Cost Plus in?</p>
<p>Monty Python explained that &#8220;Nobody expects the Spanish Inquistion&#8221;. On the other hand the Spanish Inquistion did not publish their schedule in detail and back it up with dozens of tables and figures. Assume Low Cost and recalculate your debt/GDP ratio. Is that really too much to ask?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>With a hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/01/the_new_budget_.html">Mark Thoma</a> who notes &#8220;The New Budget Plan Is a Sham&#8221; as a key quote from an op-ed by <a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/james_k_galbraith/2007/01/bush_balances_the_budget_by_dr.html">James K. Galbraith</a>, let’s start with where Galbraith endorsed the fiscal stimulus a few years ago: <br />
<blockquote>The only part of his corrupt, incompetent, washed-up presidency that deserves any credit, in my view, was his willingness in 2001 and 2003 to defy economic opinion and the deficit-manic editorial page of the Washington Post, proposing first tax cuts and then spending increases on a massive scale. These the economy desperately needed, as the Internet bubble collapsed and the shock of September 11 took hold. They were needed first to cushion recession, and then to bring on economic growth. The tax cuts were plutocratic and the spending increases had a large military element &#8211; but for the growth rate of the economy, it&#8217;s the magnitude that counts. As for spending, I wrote it at the time: increased public spending was the &#8220;Big Fix. I never imagined then that I would find myself obliged to credit Team Bush for doing it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree that we witnessed an inward shift of the IS curve when the “Internet bubble collapsed”.  Some form of aggregate demand stimulus was certainly called for.  But why fiscal policy?  Where we in some sort of liquidity trap (horizontal LM curve) or was the IS perfectly inelastic?  I doubt it and I’m not sure forgiving of a poorly designed fiscal policy that went for more long-term stimulus and less short-term stimulus.  </p>
<p>But the point of Galbraith’s op-ed was not to praise President Bush at all:<br />
<blockquote>But now, in the new budget plan, Bush promises to take it all away. He will (he says) propose to cut spending &#8211; alongside new tax cuts to extend the old ones &#8211; sufficient to balance the budget by 2012 &#8211; the last year of the first term of his successor. The details are not yet public but they will have to involve sharp cuts in domestic programs, in capital investments, in public services and in social security and medical care. If enacted, the new program would, therefore, completely tie the hands of the new Congress, and also of whoever is elected president in 2008. And that is the point. Like everything this president does, the new budget plan is a sham. It was got up not from economic conviction but for political reasons. It&#8217;s a clever sham, playing on the Democrats&#8217; fatal weakness for taking cheap shots at the deficit. It&#8217;s a put-up-or-shut-up over-to-you move for the new Congress, which has been talking a &#8220;fiscal responsibility&#8221; line. It will put deficit hawks like Hillary Clinton in a spot: if she endorses the plan and is somehow elected anyway, her presidency would be doomed. But it&#8217;s a sham, any way you slice it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was totally on board with this critique until we got to this contention:<br />
<blockquote>Indeed, if there were ever a roadmap for economic failure, this is it. A balanced budget in 2012, achieved by spending cuts rather than by economic growth (as was the case in 1969 or 1998-2000, the last two occasions when the budget actually was balanced), would mean stagnation and social disillusion for the incoming Democrats. And that would lead to the resurrection of the Republicans in 2012. Call it Bush&#8217;s make-up gift to the party he destroyed.</p></blockquote>
<p>A combination of fiscal restraint and expansionary monetary policy might lead to results similar to what we saw during the Clinton Administration.  Even though Galbraith ends up praising John Edwards, I’m just not buying this only fiscal policy matters argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Debt eventually leaks into other areas, whether it starts with the mortgage and goes to the credit card or vice versa,&#8221; said Cliff Tan, a visiting scholar at Stanford University and an expert on credit risk. &#8220;We&#8217;re starting to see leaks now.&#8221;<br />The value of credit card accounts at least 30 days late jumped 26 percent to $17.3 billion in October from a year earlier at 17 large credit card trusts examined by the AP. That represented more than 4 percent of the total outstanding principal balances owed to the trusts on credit cards that were issued by banks such as Bank of America and Capital One and for retailers like Home Depot and Wal-Mart.<br />At the same time, defaults _ when lenders essentially give up hope of ever being repaid and write off the debt _ rose 18 percent to almost $961 million in October, according to filings made by the trusts with the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br />Serious delinquencies also are up sharply: Some of the nation&#8217;s biggest lenders _ including Advanta, GE Money Bank and HSBC _ reported increases of 50 percent or more in the value of accounts that were at least 90 days delinquent when compared with the same period a year ago.<br />The AP analyzed data representing about 325 million individual accounts held in trusts that were created by credit card issuers in order to sell the debt to investors _ similar to how many banks packaged and sold subprime mortgage loans. Together, they represent about 45 percent of the $920 billion the Federal Reserve counts as credit card debt owed by Americans.</p>

<blockquote>Nonfarm employment increased by 167,000 in December, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.5 percent</p></blockquote>
<p>The Household Survey reports an increase in employment equal to 303,000, which was enough to increase the employment-population from 63.3% to 63.4%.  The unemployment rate did not decline, however, because the labor force participation rate increased from 66.3% to 66.4%.  </p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Lately there have been a number of stories about the US eventually having a foreign legion.  Foreign legions have been before&#8230; the French have one, and the Romans of course.  I don&#8217;t know about the French foreign legion, and all I know about the Roman legions comes from the little bit I read.  But I do have some questions&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  To whom will the legionairres have loyalty?  In theory, it would be to the US, but in practice, even regular soldiers in a battle situation generally see their loyalty as to the troops fighting beside them, not to God and Country.  In the Roman legions, loyalty generally was toward the commanding officer of the legion.  Every so often, one or another commanding officer took advantage of the situation and marched on Rome itself.  Rotating commanding officers around or having a bureaucracy might solve such a problem.   </p>
<p>2.  What happens when there is an excuse to reduce the size of the military.  Think the Peace Dividend with the fall of the Soviet Union.  Say every militant Islamist on earth becomes a Southern Baptist.  You can&#8217;t just cut the size of the military when the troops need to serve a certain amount of time (20 years?) in order to get their citizenship.  Well, you can, but then you piss off the guys with guns.  And if African dictators have learned anything, its that you keep the guys with guns happy at all costs.  Even if nobody else eats, they do.</p>
<p>3.  What happens if enough legionairres have a sufficiently different perspective than most Americans?  We might end up with most recruits coming from Africa and the Middle East.  </p>
<p>4.  The odds of a recruit fighting against a country toward which he has some loyalty go up.  Is that a good thing?</p>
<p>What else is there?  What are the pros and cons?  Your thoughts?</p>
