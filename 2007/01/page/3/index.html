                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The National Review sends <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NjViZGU2MDFjYWIzZGNjMjBkYjkxNzkzNWZmNDc0MDQ">Paul Gessing</a> out to attack Bill Richardson as some big spending liberal. I wonder if this has anything to do with his decision to run for the White House as a Democrat?  Now if Mr. Gessing has provided any context to his claims, I doubt his op-ed would have been dishonest enough for Rich Lowry and Jonah Goldberg to publish in their rag:<br />
<blockquote>Richardson’s proclivity for expanding government is obvious, given the astounding 11 percent one-year spending hike he has proposed for fiscal 2008. Having grown the size of state government by an average of nearly 7 percent per year, Richardson’s record has been that of a big spender. But with the state awash in $720 million of unexpected oil and gas revenue, the temptation to spend has overwhelmed him. First and foremost, Richardson seems obsessed with lavishing more money on New Mexico’s broken public-education system. With New Mexico’s fourth and eighth graders consistently ranking among the worst performers nationally, one might expect the governor to propose major school reform, or even an educational-choice option such as tax credits for low-income students. Instead, he is simply rewarding K-through-12 teachers with 7.4 percent raises, and the schools themselves with a 9.1 percent overall funding increase that includes additional monies for the expansion of an unproven pre-kindergarten program.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s assume that Governor Richardson did inherent an unfunded education system that is failing the children of New Mexico?  Wouldn’t increasing education spending make sense?  But let’s put this 11% proposed 2008 increase in context by going to <a href="http://www.nmsbof.state.nm.us/gf/summary/index.php">New Mexico’s</a> fiscal data.  In 2005, spending was $4.71 billion or 6.8% of state GDP (reported at $68.87 billion) and revenues were $4.97 billion or 7.2% of state GDP.  New Mexico was not a big spending state in 2005.  While the budget estimates that spending will rise to $5.36 billion in 2006, but will fall to $5.18 billion in 2007.  In other words, the average annual projected increase from 2005 to 2007 would be only 5% per year.  </p>
<p>I’m not sure where Mr. Gessing gets his 11% as the Department of Finance documents don’t take Appropriations beyond 2007. But let’s assume he’s correct.  Projected spending would be $5.75 billion in 2008 as compared to revenues of $5.84 billion.  In nominal terms, we would be talking about a 6.9% increase per year, which would likely increase the spending to state GDP ratio slightly.  But this would be less than what Mr. Gessing has claimed.  Let’s just hope the children of New Mexico get a better education than the readers of the National Review.</p>

<blockquote>the national savings rate &#8211; the difference between after-tax income and expenditures &#8211; is actually negative, government statistics show.</p></blockquote>
<p>The difference between after-tax income and consumption may be private savings, but it is not national savings if taxes are less than government spending.  The first economist that he mentions certainly knows this:<br />
<blockquote>For a middle-income couple, that could mean trading $400,000 in retirement money for about $3,000 a year more during prime working years to spend on education or home improvement. “For a middle-class household, that’s a lot of money,” said Laurence J. Kotlikoff</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the co-author of <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&#038;tid=10055">The Coming Generational Storm</a>:<br />
<blockquote>According to Laurence Kotlikoff and Scott Burns, if our government continues on the course it has set, we&#8217;ll see skyrocketing tax rates, drastically lower retirement and health benefits, high inflation, a rapidly depreciating dollar, unemployment, and political instability.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>This post is by reader Scott Eklof, who can be reached at the letter s followed by c followed by o followed by e followed by k then l, all at cs dot com</p>
<p>The Bush family business is influence peddling. The family inside connections are rooted in the energy sector, financial sector, defense industries, and the intelligence services. With this Presidents history of calculated deception and secrecy one must always ask &#8220;who benefits?&#8221; When Bush announced in his State of the Union address that he wanted to double the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, at first glance it appears he is ladling out the dumplings to big oil. But no crony gets left behind in the deal.</p>
<p>The US needs to attract 2.5 billion dollars of foreign capital every day. Recently the price of oil tumbled forcing OPEC nations to dump 10 billion dollars of their US Treasuries. Bush claims that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will provide for our &#8220;energy security&#8221;. Unfortunately because of all the dumplings that have been ladled out over the last six years Asian central banks have become increasingly reluctant to buy US debt. So putting a floor under the price of oil has become critical to ensure that OPEC nations will continue to use their petrodollars to buy US debt.</p>
<p>So big oil gets higher oil prices. The highly leveraged financial sector gets massive infusions of recycled petrodollars to bid up asset value and keep interest rates low. With the Mideast flush in cash the US defense industries can line up their customers. There is no region in the world that buys more US weapons then the middle east.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Bush family tradition to sell arms to anyone who bellies up to the counter. Potential enemy? No problem. Need a loan? We can help you with that. George Herbert Walker invested millions in the German arms industry between the wars. Great way to do business. Get rich making Hitler strong, then sell arms to Germany&#8217;s terrified neighbors. Walkers grandson George H.W. Bush armed friend and foe alike.</p>
<p>Intelligences services thrive when adversaries arm. So they don&#8217;t get left out either.</p>
<p>Best of all the cost for all these dumplings is bore by the little guy at the pump. Poverty and despair change a mans focus. Its easy to find religion under these conditions. Might even become a Republican.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Last Sunday, I had a post about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/lost-luggage.html">lost luggage</a>.  In comments, reader dilbert dogbert (I suspect that’s not his real name) noted “people don&#8217;t take the airlines $500 offer to folks who will give up their seats on an overbooked flight” and suggested it might be a good topic for discussion.  Consider… in many instances, the offer is – you’re booted until the next flight an hour later, and for that you get a voucher for $300 or $500.  Most people don’t get $300 or $500 for their time.  Some thoughts…</p>
<p>1.  dogbert dilbert may be wrong.  The girlfriend and I were talking, and she noted that sometimes you see people fighting for those vouchers, and sometimes you don’t see many takers.  So if dogbert dilbert is wrong, he’s not always wrong<br />2.  As reader Jim a pointed out, for some travelers (i.e., those traveling on the government dime), it may be against regulations to accept money <br />3.  Presumably the average hourly income of those who fly is worth more than average.  Still, I doubt most flyers make $300 an hour<br />4.  There are hidden costs to accepting the voucher, such as missing a connecting flight or increased chances that your luggage, flying ahead, will be lost.<br />5.  People don’t like changes to their plans.  Its been shown that on average, people value an item X worth $Z that they already own more than they value an item Y that they do not own that is also worth $Z.  <br />6.  Not all of one’s time is equally valuable.</p>
<p>I think the last one is the answer that explains most of the dilbert dogbert paradox, and its also the most interesting one.  If you have a one week stay in Cancun or wherever scheduled, an hour hold-up is an hour off time you may value more than an hour from your normal schedule.  But that can explain why they don’t take the voucher on their way out – what about the way back?  Well, the time right after the trip is worth a lot too.  One often has to recover from exhaustion before getting right to work.  (And the first few hours back at work are worth more than most of the rest of one’s time at work.)  </p>
<p>But… this explanation has problems too … most people are reluctant to take the vouchers even if they’re off to visit some boring and hygeinically challenged in-law, when in fact, taking the voucher would actually result in a decrease in low value time.  I suspect in cases like that, the first few reasons go up in importance.</p>

                                <p>The latest from the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=7731&#038;sequence=0">Congressional Budget Office</a> suggests the publicly held Federal debt will fall to around 20% of GDP by 2017.  I have two small problems with this projection – both alluded to by <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/01/budget-forecasts.html">Kash</a>: <br />
<blockquote>The White House and its allies are trumpeting the figures as illustrating that Bush&#8217;s policies will lead to a balanced budget by the year 2012. There are just a couple of problems with that conclusion.  First, it&#8217;s worth making the oft-repeated point that the budget deficit reported in the newspaper headlines is not necessarily the number that matters. Or at least, it probably shouldn&#8217;t be. That&#8217;s because the &#8220;headline&#8221; figure (which is the one that is causing the White House to rejoice because it will move from deficit to surplus in the year 2012) includes the Social Security surplus. Since that surplus is essentially a place-holder for future liabilities that the US government is going to have to face down the road (when it has to pay SS benefits to baby-boomer retirees), a more comprehensive picture of the government&#8217;s fiscal picture should focus instead on what the budget deficit would be excluding the SS surplus &#8211; a concept called the &#8220;on-budget deficit&#8221;. As the figure below shows, if you exclude the SS surplus, the on-budget (or &#8220;general fund&#8221;) federal government balance will remain negative for the complete forecast range … But regardless, it is true that even the on-budget balance shows a marked improvement between the years 2010 and 2012. Why is that? Simple: because during those years the Bush tax cuts are currently slated to expire. The CBO forecast assumes that they will. But what would happen if Bush got his wish and those tax cuts were made permanent? The next chart tells the story. Instead of the current CBO projection of a deficit of $85 billion in 2012, the deficit would be about $460 billion &#8211; quite a difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>This got me thinking about what the total Federal debt to GDP ratio, which is currently just over 66%, would look like as 2017 if the CBO forecasts hold.  Following the monetarist arithmetic utilized by Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace in 1981 to criticize the 1981 tax cut, let’s explore the assumptions in the CBO report starting with real GDP growth, which is assumed to be around 2.3% per year, and real interest rates, which are assumed to be around 3%.  With 2006 GDP being around $13 trillion and total Federal debt being around $8.6 billion, we start with a debt to GDP ratio near 66.2%.  </p>
<p>As I read the assumptions in the CBO report, non-interest spending including Social Security is projected to be around 17.7% of GDP, while taxes including payroll taxes to be around 19.5%.  In other words, the primary surplus including the Social Security Trust Fund is projected to average 1.8% of GDP.  In present value terms over the infinite horizon (Max Sawicky – please forgive), we have a surplus equal to 260% of current GDP, which exceeds the current ratio of publicly held debt to GDP.  So if we let the tax cuts expire and if we focus on publicly held debt, then the debt to GDP ratio will fall.  </p>
<p>The CBO report conveniently provides us with the projected Social Security surplus over this period, which averages 1.8% of GDP.  Why anyone would question the solvency of this Trust Fund given these projections is beyond me.  But we are focusing on the General Fund.  Even if we let the tax cuts expire, the primary surplus in terms of total Federal debt will average only 0.4% of GDP so its present value would be less than the current debt to GDP ratio.  So even if the tax cuts expire, the total debt to GDP will increase to around 67%.  </p>
<p>But what if President Bush gets his way and we extend his tax cuts?  In this case, the primary deficit will be 0.3% of GDP, which implies a faster acceleration of total Federal debt.  And as our graph suggests (well, the graph will appear as soon as Blogger stops having its technical problems), the ratio of total Federal debt to GDP will rise over the next 11 years reaching almost 75% by 2017.  In other words, failure to reverse Bush’s phony tax cuts will imply a greater Burden of the Debt for our children.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The other day I had a post about readers and lurkers.  I got to learn about our readers from the comments.  Frankly, its humbling to have the opportunity to write material that gets read by such a diverse crowd.  What&#8217;s most interesting is the large number of readers that are not trained in economics.  </p>
<p>One of the things that attracted me about economics is that it is, in many ways, accessible.  Sure, there are some fairly sophisticated tools and methods out there; as with any other field, some things may be hard for the non-specialist to follow, but often that&#8217;s due more to the lingo of the natives than anything else.  Economics, in the end, is about human behavior and interaction (i.e., how people react to motivations and constraints) which is a topic that most humans (and a few of the other readers) can grok.  </p>
<p>One thing those of us with some specialized training can bring is some sense of how things have occurred in the past &#8211; most theory, at least most theory that is any good, is developed on the basis of observation, after all.  We also know where the information sits.  Turn on the tv, and you have some talking head talking about the national debt or some other topic.  But the average viewer doesn&#8217;t know how big that debt is, or whether its growing or shrinking.  One thing I always liked about Angry Bear &#8211; long before I was a poster, I commented, and long before I commented, I was a reader, is that the writers make an effort to point to the data, to show you where it actually comes from.  But writing for the Angry Bear, I&#8217;ve come to realize the benefit to making things as straightforward as I am able.  (And I grant you that I&#8217;m not always able to make them clear enough.)   One cannot hide behind one&#8217;s tools, one must actually understand, or at least try to understand, what is going on.  Because our readers will catch it if one doesn&#8217;t.  </p>
<p>But each reader has his or her own experiences.  This variety means that the perspective we get from readers (in comments, in guest posts, and in private e-mails) is itself amazing.  Things that you write get me thinking along lines that would never occur to me.  (I imagine this is the same for the other writers.)  </p>
<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t have a smooth segue to where I&#8217;m going, but I&#8217;d like remind readers &#8211; perhaps you don&#8217;t have the time during the day to post a comment, but perhaps there&#8217;s something you want to discuss that hasn&#8217;t been covered, or hasn&#8217;t been covered the way you feel it should.  I would like to encourage readers to write up a guest post.  Even if its just a series of questions.  Even if your background has no economics in it.  And even if, perhaps especially if, I don&#8217;t agree with the post.  As long as its thoughtful, and I think its Angry Bear material, I&#8217;ll put it up.</p>

                                <p>Update: <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2007/jan/26/a_growing_military_credibility_gap">Larry Johnson</a> compares the <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/01/22/iraq.karbala/index.html?section=cnn_latest">initial incorrect account</a> of how five of our soldiers were killed by <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070126/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq_sneak_attack">insurgents dressed in US military uniforms</a>.  After Larry gets over the fact that the US military lied in its initial account, he writes:<br />
<blockquote>At the very moment we are surging troops into Baghdad, who will be scattered in small outposts throughout the city and will have to rely on Iraqi soldiers to protect them, we learn belatedly that someone in Iraq is dressing up in US military uniforms, carrying US weapons, and speaking English like a gringo. You know what this means? U.S. soldiers who were already skeptical about the trustworthiness of their Iraqi counterparts will now also have to question whether the U.S. soldier coming towards them is really a U.S. soldier.</p></blockquote>
<p>We don’t have enough US soldiers to carry out this mission, but I have to rescind my suggestion that the chickenhawks should enlist.  After all – if Jonah Goldberg was walking towards you, wouldn’t you question whether he was really a U.S. soldier?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Does <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODIxNWQ0ZjE1MzdlOWRjYTI0ZjNiNTY1OTZiZDJmMjY=">Jonah Goldberg</a> have any clue why we must stay in Iraq? I ask this given his attack on Democrats in general and on Senator Webb &#8211; who did serve in Vietnam.  Yes, Jonah Goldberg has not volunteered to serve in either Iraq or Afghanistan as he bravely types McCarthyite insults at those who realize this war was a mistake from the beginning.  But that does not make him unique among all those chickenhawk, draft dodging neocons (did someone say Dick Cheney).  But his attack oddly starts with how Senator Webb quoted President Eisenhower followed by:<br />
<blockquote>One wonders if the untold millions of North Koreans who&#8217;ve starved, bled, and died since then would similarly applaud Eisenhower&#8217;s courage and wisdom. For more than half a century, North Korea has been a prison-camp society beyond the imagining of George Orwell, where public executions for stealing food are familiar events. The man-made famine of the 1990s alone claimed the lives of up to 1 million people (hard data from Stalinist regimes are difficult to come by).</p></blockquote>
<p>OK – but South Korea did not call to the communists.  I mention the “Domino Effect with No Dominoes” because after South Vietnam fell to the government up north with Cambodia already heading to the Khmer Rouge disaster thanks to Nixon undermining its Prince to install Lon Nol, our very weak puppet, we did not see the rest of Southeast Asia fall under Communist rule.  So are we staying there so our soldiers can be killed along with innocent Iraqis in this civil war brought on by Bush’s 3/19/2003 blunder – one that was supported by chickenhawks like Mr. Goldberg?  </p>
<p>Incidentally, our troops are still there but they are not being killed on a daily basis like they are in Iraq.  But if the chickenhawk squad wishes to rush North Korea to rescue these poor souls, may I suggest that Jonah Goldberg lead the charge?  This silly tirade gets even stranger as we read further:<br />
<blockquote>None of this explains why Democrats are so eager to support continued U.S. fighting against the Taliban as part of NATO forces in Afghanistan, even though that puts us between two sides in what amounts to an Afghan civil war. But maybe Afghanistan is a humanitarian crisis too. Or maybe it&#8217;s an excuse for Democrats to prove they are still tough as far as foreign policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess no one told Mr. Goldberg that the people that hit us on 9/11 were not being protected by Saddam Hussein but rather by the Taliban.  And has he not paid any attention that these same folks are retraining near the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Lt. Col. Peter W. Huggins writes an op-ed for the <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20070124-094727-6162r.htm">Washington Times</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The versatility and robustness of our armed forces will be crucial to our country&#8217;s future foreign-policy success in a world where the only certainty is uncertainty. Zero-sum arguments that advocate shifting money to one service at the expense of another overlook the other choice &#8211; increasing the defense budget. While the nature of the current conflict suggests that boosting defense spending to a share in line with past conflicts, such as World War II, Korea and Vietnam, is not necessary, an increase to the levels seen at the end of the Cold War &#8211; our nation&#8217;s most recent &#8220;long war&#8221; &#8211; is warranted.</p></blockquote>
<p>So how much extra DoD spending is he talking about?  In 2005, national defense spending was $589.3 billion as compared to $354.9 billion in 1988 – representing a 66% nominal increase.  OK, we have to inflation-adjust these figures but the general price index rose by less than 50%.  The price index for defense goods did rise by 64% over this period, which would mean that in real terms, we are still spending more on national defense than we did in 1988.  </p>
<p>Is Lt. Col. Higgins suggesting that we set defense spending to be almost 7% of GDP, which is where we were in 1988?  In 2005, nominal GDP was $12,455.8 billion so defense spending represented 4.73% of GDP.  If it had been 7% of GDP, then we’d be talking about a defense budget of $872 billion.  Just imagine how high Federal taxes would have to be if we were to fund this kind of defense spending and move towards fiscal responsibility!  The scary part is that this may be what this White House has in mind for defense spending.  But this White House is likely not going to formally recognize the need for higher taxes – leaving that responsibility for the next President.  So much for this part of the State of the Union speech:<br />
<blockquote>In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the Federal deficit within the next 5 years. I ask you to make the same commitment. Together, we can restrain the spending appetite of the Federal Government, and balance the Federal budget.</p></blockquote>
