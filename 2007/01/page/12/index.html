                                                                    </div>

                                <p>It seems that critics of the minimum wage are now arguing that the beneficiaries of higher wages are members of well to do households, such as <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Economy/wm1186.cfm">surburban teenagers</a>.  Rea Hederman and James Sherk cite <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2005.htm">Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers: 2005</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Of those paid by the hour, 479,000 were reported as earning exactly $5.15, the prevailing Federal minimum wage. Another 1.4 million were reported as earning wages below the minimum. Together, these 1.9 million workers with wages at or below the minimum made up 2.5 percent of all hourly-paid workers … Minimum wage workers tend to be young. About half of workers earning $5.15 or less were under age 25, and about one-fourth of workers earning at or below the minimum wage were age 16-19. Among employed teenagers, about 9 percent earned $5.15 or less. About 2 percent of workers age 25 and over earned the minimum wage or less. Among those age 65 and over, the proportion was about 3 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>When Hederman and Sherk say few workers earn the minimum wage or less, I’m not sure 1.9 million people constitutes just a few.  But when they also say:<br />
<blockquote>Data from the Department of Labor show that most minimum wage-earners are young, part-time workers and that relatively few live below the poverty line. A minimum wage hike, then, is more a raise for suburban teenagers than for the working poor. If Congress is serious about helping the working poor, it should look elsewhere than raising the minimum wage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Going from: (a) most of those earning $5.15 an hour are age 25 or less to: (b) most are suburban teenagers strikes me as a real stretch.  There are no single parents under the age of 25?  </p>
<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/01/minimum-wage-vs-eitc.html">Greg Mankiw</a> is touting another <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/77xx/doc7721/01-09-MinimumWageEITC.pdf">CBO report</a>: <br />
<blockquote>On the basis of data from the March 2005 CPS, about 18 percent of the 12 million workers who were paid an hourly wage rate between the federal minimum wage of $5.15 and $7.24 were in families that had a total cash income below the federal poverty threshold in 2004. Had all of the workers in that wage range, instead, received $7.25 per hour, they would have gotten about $11 billion in additional wages in that year. About 15 percent of those additional wages ($1.6 billion) would have been received by workers in poor families. As requested, CBO examined the potential effects of hypothetical expansions in the EITC that would have provided additional payments to workers in poor families similar to the amount of additional earnings poor workers would have received by increasing the minimum wage rate to $7.25 per hour. One option was to increase the subsidy rate for childless workers by 50 percent. Another option was to increase the subsidy rate for workers with three or more children by 25 percent. On the basis of data from the CPS, combining those options would have increased total EITC payments by roughly $2.4 billion in 2004, with workers in poor families receiving $1.4 billion of that total.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before one concludes that we don’t really need an increase in the minimum wage, however, <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002771.html">Max Sawicky</a> requests that we read <a href="http://www.urban.org/publications/311401.html">Elaine Maag</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Two primary wage-support policies help low-income families: the minimum wage and targeted tax credits. Since 1997, when Congress last raised the minimum wage, the real value of the minimum wage has fallen about 20 percent because of inflation, while the earned income tax credit (EITC) and child credit have been expanded. This brief illustrates how current tax rules interact with the minimum wage and considers whether increased tax credits could substitute for minimum-wage increases for those earning the federal minimum wage. Increasing tax credits enough to substitute for raising minimum wage is probably infeasible because of the cost and the high marginal tax rates required. A more direct route to helping low-wage workers is to raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/10/washington/10wage.html?ex=1326085200&#038;en=b7ee28fa5a41a606&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">Steven Greenhouse</a> interviews a few economists: <br />
<blockquote>Many economists, especially conservative ones, insist that raising the minimum wage would not reduce poverty, saying it would ultimately reduce the number of jobs for low-skilled workers. But other economists, especially liberal ones, say a higher minimum would have virtually no effect on job levels while it lifted the pay for millions of low-wage workers. “The increase will make a big difference for someone who makes the minimum wage &#8211; you’re talking about thousands of dollars a year in extra earnings,” said Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, and one of the economists scheduled to testify before the Finance Committee. “It’s important to remember that if you don’t have a binding wage floor, a lot of workers are going to end up disconnected from the improving economy and that’s exactly what’s happened.” Mr. Bernstein’s institute estimates that six million workers earn less than $7.25 an hour, but workers earning a dollar or two more than that can also expect to see their wages increase if a new minimum is enacted. joseph Sabia, a professor of consumer economics at the University of Georgia, said an increase would do little to lift workers out of poverty. “Most people who earn the minimum wage are not poor or near poor,” Professor Sabia said. “If the goal is to help the working poor, it would be better to raise the earned-income tax credit,” which refunds cash to poor workers.</p>
<p>The traditional economists’ view has been that a higher minimum wage would mean some job losses for low-wage workers. But a landmark 1994 study by David Card and Alan Krueger upset the common wisdom by finding that there were no overall job losses when New Jersey raised its minimum wage. David Neumark, a longtime critic of that study and an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine, said most credible studies had concluded that an increase in the minimum wage did hurt employment for unskilled workers, although most studies did not find major job reductions. He said an increase to $7.25 might reduce job levels for the least skilled workers by 4 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been listening to several conservative politicians claim that this 40% increase in the minimum wage would lead to substantial job losses, but it seems David Neumark is suggesting that the employment effects would be only a 4% reduction in the demand for low skill workers.  Advanced calculus suggests that the elasticity of demand is a mere 0.1, which suggests that overall worker pay would rise as noted by <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/01/opponent_of_minimum_wage_says.html#015071">Dean Baker</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Okay, it&#8217;s fun with numbers time. The minimum wage hike to $7.25 an hour will increase the wage for the those at the very bottom by 40.8 percent. Mr. Neumark believes that it will result in a 4 percent decline in employment, according to the article. That means that these least skilled workers will on average end up with 35.1 percent higher wages after the minimum wage hike than they do now (0.96*140.8 percent). That sounds like a pretty good deal for those at the bottom.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Based in part on a comment in another post by reader Peter Schaeffer, I started to think about the business cycle.  I note that the President and his people have long insisted that there was a long recession whose effects were reduced by GW&#8217;s tax cuts.  </p>
<p>For example, here are some <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/mankiw_speech_nabe_20030915.html">comments made by Greg Mankiw</a> a few years back:</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contraction end of the rope were the shocks that the U.S. economy had experienced over the preceding three years: the end of the high-tech bubble and the consequent effects on wealth, consumption, and especially investment; the revelation of years of wrongdoing at some corporations; and the impact of the September 11 attacks and the subsequent uncertainties surrounding the war on terror and the conflict with Iraq. Other contractionary forces came from abroad. Slow growth in many of our trading partners, notably Japan and much of Europe, depressed our exports, and it continues to do so today. Given these events, it was remarkable that the U.S. economy was not in worse shape in 2002 and entering 2003, but this fact was of little consolation to people looking for work or to retirees who had seen their savings depleted by the stock market decline. </p>
<p>Pulling hard on the other end of the rope were the expansionary forces of monetary and fiscal policy—the Federal Reserve’s series of interest rate cuts and the Administration’s tax cut in 2001 and the stimulus package of 2002.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short according to Mankiw, more tax cuts were needed to break this impasse, so the President wisely cut taxes again, and since then we&#8217;ve all lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>Mankiw went on:  </p>
<p>&#8220;Had we done nothing, the economy would eventually have recovered from the recession. But the actions the President took made the recession less severe. </p>
<p>As the President has discussed, analysis done within the Administration has shown how his tax cuts have substantially offset the series of adverse shocks that have been buffeting the economy. Simulations of a conventional macroeconomic model show that, without the tax cuts, the level of real GDP would have been about 2 percent lower in the middle of 2003. About 1.5 million fewer people would have jobs today. The job market is not what we would like it to be right now, but it would have been worse without the Administration’s actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this is the crux of an interesting question.  Most of the rest of us would agree that the economy would eventually have recovered&#8230;.  many of us think the economy might even have recovered somewhat faster with a different President and different economic advisor.  3 years seems an awfully long time for a contraction to be going on, larger contractionary hits from abroad have happened before with little adverse consequence to the economy (in fact, it may well be that some of those contractions abroad Mankiw mentioned were exacerbated by the US situation more than the other way around), and as to the War in Iraq&#8230;  </p>
<p>Leaving aside the point PGL always makes, that a cut in tax rates that doesn’t reduce the debt is not a tax cut, it’s a tax postponement, we&#8217;re left with a few questions to ponder&#8230;  if you were the President, and you continued to repeat these points several years later, or if you were Mankiw, how would you go about proving these claims:</p>
<p>1.  Recessions come to an end faster with a tax cut<br />2.  This particular slowdown would have continued to linger without not just one round, but two, of tax cuts<br />3.  The economy is better off in the long run leaving the tax cut in place long after the slowdown has come to an end</p>
<p>Why am I putting the burden on Mankiw?  Well, I am not a great student of what Mankiw says, but I know that at least one time, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/ask/20040507.html">Mankiw did say</a>:</p>
<p>“Finally, the President’s tax cuts did contribute to the budget deficit but they also are partly responsible for the robust economic recovery that we are currently experiencing.”</p>
<p>Now, we don’t all agree that the tax cuts contributed to the recovery, but we all do agree that it had some negative consequences.  Thus, those who advocate the policy should be able to justify those negative consequences, and the only way to do it is to prove the positives are greater.  So to folks like Mankiw and other tax cutting folks – what about it?</p>
<p>And while I think the responsibility for checking these claims lies with the Mankiws, at this blog we like to play with numbers ourselves…  anyone have any suggestions for how to check the three claims above?</p>

                                <p>Every time I open a can of tuna fish, I can’t stop humming <a href="http://www.tvacres.com/admascots_chicken_sea.htm">What&#8217;s the Best Tuna</a>.  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/01/post_nails_democrats_on_samoa.html#015049">Dean Baker</a> just cured this problem with another one: <br />
<blockquote>Jonathan Weisman reports that the minimum wage bill that will be introduced in the House will apply to the Northern Marianas Islands, but apparently not to the territory of American Samoa. The article reports that the tuna canneries on the island pay workers an average of $3.50 an hour. These canneries are apparently big supporters of Samoa&#8217;s non-voting delegate to Congress, who is a Democrat.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I won’t be able to even open another can of tuna fish without thinking about these exploited workers.  But let’s think about whether imposing a wage floor of $3.50 an hour is a good idea (after all, <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002766.html">Max Sawicky</a> is confusing me with Greg Mankiw of late).  </p>
<p>First of all – there isn’t really great data on the economy of American Samoa and the information from the CIA’s <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/aq.html#Econ">World Factbook</a>.  First, it says GDP is around $510 million and then it says per capita GDP is around $5800 even though the population is less than 60,000.  The CIA also says the unemployment rate is almost 30% and has this general description:<br />
<blockquote>American Samoa has a traditional Polynesian economy in which more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is strongly linked to the US with which American Samoa conducts most of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the primary export. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to American Samoa&#8217;s economic well being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa&#8217;s remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism is a promising developing sector.</p></blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that the town of Tutuila has only two tuna canneries with one of them canning tuna for Chicken-of-the-Sea and the other one pictured <a href="http://www.terragalleria.com/pacific/american-samoa/pago-pago/picture.samo3904.html">here</a>.  These two canneries employ about a third of the formal workforce with the government employing another one-third and the remaining formal workforce being employed by the services economy.</p>
<p>Before we discuss the economics of minimum wages, we should note a few aspects of the regulations and advantages that these tuna canneries either face or enjoy.  Their parent companies enjoy special tax benefits as well as a duty-free status on canned tuna exported to the United States.  The <a href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/minwage/americanSamoa/ASminwage.htm">Department of Labor</a> notes:<br />
<blockquote>The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), applies generally to employment within American Samoa as it does to employment within the United States. The minimum wage rates for American Samoa are set by a special industry committee appointed by the U.S. Department of Labor, as required by the Act. The rates are set for particular industries, not for an employee&#8217;s particular occupation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Effective October 1, 2003, this minimum wage for this industry was $3.26 per hour, which is substantially below the U.S. minimum wage.  So what would be the effect of the well-being of American Samoan workers if the U.S. Congress mandated a higher wage floor?  We shall consider two very different models.</p>
<p>Greg Mankiw et al. assume a perfectly competitive market for workers.  In this model, the concern would be that a higher wage floor would lead to less job opportunities in Tutuila.  For example, <a href="http://www.pacificmagazine.net/issue/2002/01/01/whats-american-samoas-future-if-canneries-pack-up">Lewis Wolman</a> wrote:<br />
<blockquote>Year in and year out, the continued existence of American Samoa&#8217;s thriving tuna canning industry is imperiled, and thus the economic foundation of American Samoa is imperiled. At least that&#8217;s the story line advanced by the two multinational companies operating tuna processing plants in Pago Pago. But despite the dire warnings that American Samoa&#8217;s tuna processing industry is becoming globally uncompetitive, the two canneries keep investing more money and hiring more workers. In the past 25 years, the American Samoa canneries have increased their work forces approximately four-fold, far outpacing job creation in the government or the rest of the private sector. The two plants are now reported to be the largest and third largest tuna processing plants in the world. StarKist Samoa and Samoa Packing directly employ more than 5000 full-time workers &#8211; compared to 1976, when they employed 1400. They process almost 1000 tons of tuna each working day, enough to fill a thousand 20-foot containers each month for an annual export of US$500 million worth of tuna &#8211; the majority of the canned tuna eaten in the United States. StarKist Samoa is owned by food conglomerate HJ Heinz (annual sales: $9 billion), while Samoa Packing is part of Chicken of the Sea, now owned by Thai Union, a privately-held, very large company based in Thailand. American Samoa&#8217;s tuna plants face global competition from newly emerging tuna processors such as Thailand, Ecuador, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam, which provide low wages. Thus the canneries are constantly fighting to keep minimum wages low in American Samoa. The vast majority of the tuna industry workers earn between US$3.25 and US$3.50 an hour. Although such wages are low compared to the United States and Guam, where the minimum wage is US$5.15 an hour, they are relatively high in Polynesia and thus draw workers from Samoa and Tonga.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, $3.26 an hour is most the competitive market would pay for those currently working in these two tuna canneries.  Increasing the wage floor would simply increase the unemployment rate.  That is – if you buy the Mankiw perfectly competitive market view. I find Wolman’s discussion interesting as he presents the argument but never endorses it.  </p>
<p>There is also the monopsony market view given that only two companies exist in this labor market and the workers are sort of faced with the one company town situation where they don’t have many choices.  What would that kind of labor market look like?  First, wages would be low as well as employment as that’s how monopsonists keeps wages down.  And the profits of the multinationals would tend to be high.  Of course, these profits would be captured by the foreign multinationals, which would imply that GNP would actually be less than GDP.  Some accounts have the GNP of American Samoa being only $470 million as compared to the $510 million of GDP.  Is this arm’s length profitability or more evidence of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/output-volatility-gdp-v-gnp.html">tranfsr pricing manipulation</a>?  </p>
<p>But back to our question.  If the two tuna canneries do enjoy monopsony power, then a higher minimum wage would lead to more employment – not less.  Of course, U.S. policymakers could consider something akin to an Earned Income Tax Credit as Greg Mankiw suggests.  But this is the real reason why I bothered to mention <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002771.html">Max Sawicky</a>:<br />
<blockquote>To keep the story simple, in 2006 the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit for a family with two children is $4,536. To get this you need earnings of $11,340, a bit more than the earnings of one full-time minimum wage worker ($10,300 for a 2,000 hour year). An increase in the minimum wage to $7.25 from $5.15 increases pre-tax earnings by $4,200. Matching this with a higher EIC raises at least three issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>While you should read the rest of Max’s post, I have to apologize to all as I don’t know enough about the economy of American Samoa to model Max’s insights for the situation of this island with few potential employers.</p>

<blockquote>One thing that happened over the past six years &#8211; a thing that I had not recognized &#8211; was how much the policies of the Bush administration have destroyed the power of my own faction, the deficit hawk faction, within the Democratic Party. The failure of the Republican deficit hawks to put up even the most feeble of struggles against George W. Bush has led every other faction in the Democratic Party to conclude that we Democratic deficit hawks are saps: deluded enablers of the Republican leadership&#8217;s right-wing class war.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a fellow member of the Democratic deficit hawk faction, let me agree with Brad 100%.  The GOP leadership has conspired with the rightwing in CLASS WARFARE (let me invite the partisan liar known as Robert Novak try to sue me).  Alas, the kids will suffer in the form of less output per person to divide.  Any member of this rightwing faction who argues Laffer curve style garbage that theirs is a ProGrowth agenda is either a liar or a fool.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>In Brazil, a shanty-town is called a favela.  When I was growing up in South America (the 1970s and 1980s), shacks in the shanties were typically made of plywood, cardboard, and corrugated tin.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.freewisdom.org/en/all/albums/2005-12-30-b-vidigal/20051230_035_1876/">a photo of good-sized favela</a> in Rio today that I found on the web.  A few things to note&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  Its on a hill.  In the US, homes on a hillside are often more expensive because they command a view.  I believe in Brazil, the government often refuses to allow private ownership of a lot of hillside property (someone correct me on this please) because of the danger of landslides.  Thus, the poor, who have no other place to go, end up building their homes on hills.<br />2.  The homes are now made of bricks and concrete.  After existing for long enough, its become virtually impossible for the government to evict the squatters.  Once a de facto property right exists, it becomes worth the time, effort, and expenditure to build using better materials than plywood, cardboard, and corrugated tin.  Also&#8230; many of the homes have two and three stories.  By the time a squatter got his/her &#8220;property rights&#8221; he or she already had neighbors &#8211; the only direction to expand was vertically.<br />3.  The danger of landslides continues to exist.  Many poor people die in these landslides every year.  But you don&#8217;t have the spectacle of taxpayers repeatedly bailing out the owners of multi-million dollar homes in Malibu.<br />4.  The view from the favela is spectacular.  This particular favela, if memory serves, is close to the old Sheraton&#8230; between the Leblon and Sao Conrado beaches.  (Leblon is separated from the famous Ipanema beach by a canal, but is a much more livable neighborhood than Ipanema.  The most expensive apartment building in Rio sits in Leblon, across the street from the beach.  Sao Conrado also boasts some of the most expensive apartment buildings in the city.)  </p>

<p>Update&#8230;  Note, with respect to item 4&#8230; not all favelas have such a view.  In fact, evn from most shantytowns in Rio, the view sucks.   Go somewhere like Sao Paulo and its worse.</p>
<p>Update 2 &#8211; Question&#8230; Anyone have any guesses as to why the very poor in neighboring countries, say, Argentina and Uruguay, historically seem to have better homes than those in Brazil?  Its something I&#8217;ve always wondered.</p>

                                <p>One accusation made against GW is that stability in Afghanistan was sacrificed in favor of the war in Iraq.  In fact, it seems that Osama himself may have gotten away because the US farmed out the job of catching him at Tora Bora, largely because the US military was preparing to attack Iraq.  All along, the war in Afghanistan has been shortchanged in resources (all kinds of things, from personnel, equipment, and even the US ambassador have been diverted from Afghanistan to Iraq) for the mess in Iraq.</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_01/010530.php">Kevin Drum</a>, we learn the policy may continue to the bitter end&#8230;  troops diverted at this point may actually lead to substantially losses of control in Afghanistan.  Does this strike anyone as good policy?</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Paygo,&#8221; as Washington insiders call it, sounds like a fiscally prudent budget practice: If government spends more on program A, it has to spend less money on program B, and thus budget deficits will be restrained. We&#8217;re all for that. But when Republicans proposed exactly that budget rule in recent years, House Democrats voted it down.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh Lord – it’s the Kudlow canared about spending paygo with no revenue paygo.  The WSJ oped continues with a claim that this is really about blocking even more tax cuts and making it easier to reverse some of Bush’s earlier tax cuts.  Mark blames the WSJ for its previous Laffer curve assertions.</p>
<p>But fellows, the facts show that real tax revenues per capita were reduced by Bush’s tax “cuts”.  And the Laffer curve assertions that these tax cuts raised long-term growth look really silly when one recognizes two facts: (1) national savings was reduced; and (2) the labor force participation rate is lower today than it was in 2000.  Given the fact that Federal spending has increased, President Bush’s fiscal policies have already raised taxes but deferred the responsibility of collecting them to future governments.  Since the WSJ oped pages can’t recognize such simple realities, I’m not sure why one of the world’s best business newspapers continues to tolerate the stupidity and mendacity displayed on its oped pages.  After all – one can read this malarkey over at the National Review.</p>

Here&#8217;s the Smithsonian&#8217;s page on the <a href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/Amazonia/Facts/capybarafacts.cfm">&#8220;Capybara&#8221;</a> &#8211;  a South American river rat that looks kinda like a cross between small horse and a giant mutant hamster.  Here is <a href="http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/vecase/Behavior/Spring2002/Willoughby/willoughby.html">everything you might possibly want to know about capybaras</a>.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>My formative years were the 1980s.  Like most other times in history, it was a scary time.  The thing to be scared of, apparently, was Japan.  You couldn’t so much look at the cover of a Time Magazine without seeing yet another sign that Japan was going to take over the world.  Popular authors wrote bad novels, at the end of which they put in pages and pages of notes about how in real life, the enemy was buying all of our property… and the evidence was all around us &#8211; “the Japanese” bought Rockefeller center, and much of Hawaii, and that was just a start.  It almost got to the point where I was checking under the bed and in the closet for Japanese people before turning out the lights and going to bed.  Some in Japan, of course, were helping the run-up of these feelings – books came out of Japan with titles like “The Japan that Can Say No” and which advocated blackmailing the US by threatening to turn over vital technology to the Soviets.  </p>
<p>Now, of course, Japan isn’t perceived as a threat so just about every country has good relations with them.  But the concept of a threat is common.  In the 1940s, there was some worry that Germany, or perhaps Japan would eventually take over the world.  In the 1950s and 1960s, it was the USSR.  In the 1970s, polyester and disco were bigger problems than any of them damn foreigners, but on the other hand, them damn foreigners were worried about us – if you cracked open a Le Monde or a Der Spiegel, you couldn’t help but see stories about how the US was buying up everything – and forcing everyone to wear polyester.  By the 1980s, it was Japan again.  In the 1990s, we were happy – the US had established its hegemony again.  Now, of course, the fear is that a bunch of fanatics living in the 14th century (and whose grooming habits predate even that) are poised to take over anything.  (Granted, the fact that the President has worked things in a way that those clowns are actually winning two simultaneous wars against the US, but that’s a different story.)</p>
<p>But its not just the 14th century we’re worried about.  We’re also scared of China.  All y’all might recall that when GW took office, he referred to China as a strategic competitor, and his supporters talked incessantly about how Clinton had sold American military technology to China, at least until the GW administration gave the Chinese government 3 months to take apart and rebuild an EP-3.  But I digress…</p>
<p>Anyway, whether China is going to be the next Superpower, or whether it will go the way that the 14th century is going to go has been debated by people who know a lot more than I.  Still, that won’t stop me.  I was reading <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1984044,00.html"> this story</a> by a guy who has a book on China coming out.  His thesis is that China is going to be having trouble in the near future… they are at the limits of what they can export, decisions made by the central government are having horrible consequences to the environment, etc.  But if I read the piece correctly, he argues that the biggest problem is the lack of property rights, or rather that the what property rights there are granted exclusively by the central government.  It may call itself communist, but it seems to operate like Imperial China did.</p>
<p>Regular readers might recall I posted something similar about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/recent-of-history-of-south-america-and.html"> South America</a>.  I noted that names are often misleading – in South America, in many instances it was those that were labeled Marxist that wanted to ensure property rights for those who had lived on and cultivated land for generations, while those that called themselves capitalists were trying to preserve a feudal state with a hereditary aristocracy.  I also noted that many of the problems – lack of development and even the perennial revolutions – that occur in South America are due to the fact that the folks who lived on and cultivated land for generations did not legally own that land – land ownership was in the hands of a few who were far away.</p>
<p>So part of this story is familiar.  But how familiar is it?  What are the next ten years going to look like for China?  The next twenty?</p>
