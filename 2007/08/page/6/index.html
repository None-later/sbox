<blockquote><p>For those who struggle to pay their bills, who watch their housing payments rise out of reach with their adjustable-rate mortgages, who lose a job or who fall victim to illness, losing one’s home can feel like hitting bottom. But one more financial indignity may await as the fallout from the great housing boom ripples across the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>The whole concept can be counterintuitive. “Your home has declined in value and you lose it,” Mr. Eggert said. “Then the I.R.S. says you owe tens of thousands in taxes because you got a windfall when the debt was forgiven.”</p></blockquote>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Regular readers know I&#8217;ve written a very large number of posts looking at how a number of series have evolved since 1953, in particular paying attention to how they moved by Presidential administration.  Topics covered included economic growth, murders, abortions, national debt, and pretty much anything I thought the President might affect, or which might affect the Presidency in some way.  All along, I’ve been using graphs to make the process as easy to follow and intuitive as possible.  Some of the posts have generated a lot of discussion and generated a lot of e-mail, some not so much.  </p>
<p>I have a few more topics to cover, but I&#8217;m close to what I think would be a good tour of US history.  Ultimately, I think as a body, the posts have been extremely thought provoking and I want to write them up as a book.  I would prefer a co-author for a few reasons:<br />1. I would like to keep my personal bias from creeping into the analysis of the data<br />2. I have never written a book before<br />3. I am rather busy and of course, time is of the essence.  The ideal time for a book of this sort to come out, presumably, is early next year&#8230; some months before the election.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought I had a co-author, but it seems the person I selected is too busy these days. So&#8230;. anyone want to be a co-author on this book?  Do you know anyone who might?  If so, drop me a line&#8230;  (The address is my handle with a 4321, all as one word, at yahoo, or simply click on the address with my name at the left upper left side of the page.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my thought about where the book needs to go:</p>
<p>1. I have a few more topics to write on&#8230; the blog post is always the first pass<br />2. The posts have to be organized in groups of similar topics (e.g., the macro-economy, how well off are people, social issues, etc.)<br />3. Each of the posts has to be rewritten at least in part so they work for this format<br />4. An intro has to be written.  (I have a more or less first pass of one.)<br />5. A conclusion has to be written.<br />6. Concluding sections have to be written (e.g., who did best on issue X, rankings, etc.)<br />7. All the tables have to be redone&#8230;  as has been pointed out by many, the tables don&#8217;t look so good, though the graphs do.<br />8. Some supporting material (quotes, anecdotes, etc. have to be added)<br />9. Data sources have to be checked to make sure they haven&#8217;t migrated and/or that the data hasn&#8217;t changed significantly with new revisions. <br />10. The book needs a section explaining how the reader can do the analysis him/herself&#8230; everything from gathering the data to organizing it and reaching his/her own conclusions. This has not been written.</p>
<p>My thoughts&#8230; I&#8217;m looking for help primarily in 2 &#8211; 6 and 8.  Frankly, I expect that whoever the co-author is, he/she will essentially do 3 almost in entirety.  I don&#8217;t mean that each post must be rewritten from scratch&#8230; I expect there&#8217;s a lot from the original posts that can be kept (though I&#8217;m open to being told otherwise), but basically, I&#8217;m hoping someone takes charge of that effort.  </p>
<p>Ah&#8230; one other thing.    I want the book to be a lot more, um, non-partisan.  For instance, I&#8217;ve had a lot of fun mocking GW, who tends to do very poorly on just about every measure. But in the book, I want the tone to be more measured.  All that said, at the end of the book, a measure of the effectiveness of each President will be produced.  If the facts turn out to have a liberal bias, as Stephen Colbert pointed out (and as many of the series I&#8217;ve looked at so far seem to indicate), that&#8217;s where it will get reflected.</p>
<p>FWIW, I think a book like this can be marketed to two audiences.  One is the group of people who buy political books.  Perhaps not people who buy <a href="http://www.regnery.com/index.html">these political books</a> &#8211; as I noted, the facts seem to have a liberal bias &#8211; but I would think a lot would want some sort of description of what the data actually shows.  (In effect, this book could be a cross between a political book and reference books like the Statistical Abstract of the United States and the World Almanac, which seem to sell quite well.) Another potential market&#8230; I see no reason why this book might not be picked up for use in American history or political science classes. </p>
<p>So that&#8217;s roughly what I have in mind.  Any interest, please drop me a line.</p>

<div>Income security costs are about 6% of outlays, and the other three highest are about 61% of outlays. Since as far as I know all are still mandatory, which to opt ? I vote this way. 🙂</div>
<div>1)Maybe the Fed to limit bailouts for the top oner&#8217;s</div>
<div>2) Or the NIH to get rid of unnecessary funding for subtle toxins? </div>

<blockquote><p>But there&#8217;s less to these studies than meets the eye. They measure something other than quality of medical care. So saying that the U.S. finished behind those other countries is misleading.  First let&#8217;s acknowledge that the U.S. medical system has serious problems. But the problems stem from departures from free-market principles. The system is riddled with tax manipulation, costly insurance mandates and bureaucratic interference. Most important, six out of seven health-care dollars are spent by third parties, which means that most consumers exercise no cost-consciousness. As Milton Friedman always pointed out, no one spends other people&#8217;s money as carefully as he spends his own.  Even with all that, it strains credulity to hear that the U.S. ranks far from the top. Sick people come to the United States for treatment. When was the last time you heard of someone leaving this country to get medical care? The last famous case I can remember is Rock Hudson, who went to France in the 1980s to seek treatment for AIDS. So what&#8217;s wrong with the WHO and Commonwealth Fund studies? Let me count the ways. The WHO judged a country&#8217;s quality of health on life expectancy. But that&#8217;s a lousy measure of a health-care system. Many things that cause premature death have nothing do with medical care. We have far more fatal transportation accidents than other countries. That&#8217;s not a health-care problem. Similarly, our homicide rate is 10 times higher than in the U.K., eight times higher than in France, and five times greater than in Canada.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stossel links to a 215 page study and he takes one aspect out of the study to ridicule.  Life expectancy is one factor to look at but clearly it is not the only factor that the WHO and other studies consider.  Stossel should realize this if he bothered to read these studies.  And as he bashes the WHO, he offers no evidence in return for his suggestion that the US health care system is not as inefficient as others claim.</p>
<p>But you say he did acknowledge that we could do better.  OK – and his policy is what?  Getting rid of insurance?  The mind boggles.</p>

                                <p>This post looks at charitable giving over time, and, in particular, broken out by Presidential administration. Because I recently had a post on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-regular-church.html">regular church attendance</a>, and because religious contributions are a very big percentage of charitable contributions in general, the post also shows religious charity as a percentage of total charity.</p>
<p>The data on charity used in this post is the data used by <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2007/2007-012.pdf">Thomas A. Garrett and Russell M. Rhine</a> of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in their recent working paper entitled <em><strong>Does Government Spending Really Crowd Out Charitable Contributions? New Time Series Evidence</strong></em>. </p>
<p>The data was kindly provided by Thomas A. Garrett in private correspondence. Because the data comes from their paper, because their paper is fascinating in its own right, and because results have some bearing on this post, I’d like to spend a moment on some points raised by their paper.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. The causality tests … reveal that government spending does not cause charitable giving, but that charitable giving causes government spending. This suggests that past studies may not be capturing a causal relationship between government spending and charitable giving, but rather they are just capturing a significant correlation between the two variables. </p>
<p>2. First, we find strong evidence that a change in wealth, as measured by the S&#038;P 500, has a positive and significant effect on all categories of charitable giving. </p>
<p>3. Weak evidence is provided that changes in GDP and marginal tax rates effect charitable giving. Year-to-year changes in GDP have a positive and significant effect on charitable contributions to education only, thus providing some evidence that charitable contributions to education are procyclical. </p>
<p>4. Of all contribution categories, the evidence suggests that only education giving is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and taxes. </p>
<p>5. Finally, the coefficient on the recession dummy variable is only statistically significant in the models of charitable giving to education…. on average, charitable contributions to education are 0.51 to 0.53 percentage points higher during a recession year relative to non-recession years. This supports the idea that budget cuts or reductions in spending growth during recessions may entice more contributions to education if the public fears education services will be reduced. This again reflects the sensitivity of education giving to changes in economic conditions. </p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to data used by Garrett and Rhine, in this post I also use GDP from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">BEA’s NIPA Table 1.1.5</a>.</p>
<p>OK. Now for some graphs….</p>

<p>Garrett and Rhine’s notion that charitable giving is tied to increases in the economy and income goes some way toward explaining the results… but not all the way, when you look at things by administration. The fact that charitable giving saw its second highest increase under GHW doesn’t fit with increases in charity being correlated with increases in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">real GDP per capita</a> or <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/this-post-looks-at-disposable-income-by.html">disposable (and after change in debt obligation) real income</a>, but those variables, especially the second one, do seem to make sense in explaining the order in which the other Presidents appeared in the sample. What’s up with GHW? I have no idea. I would note that the result is basically due to the big jump from Reagan’s last year to GHW’s first year, and otherwise, there isn’t anything that would indicate there was such a big increase in giving during the GHW years. One other notable factor… as in many of these series we’ve looked at so far, things haven’t gone so well in the GW administration.</p>
<p>In any given case, given the tight relationship between real disposable income (after accounting for increases in debt) and charity, it would seem that the easiest way to get people to give more is to make them richer. Whether in general the wealthy give more to charity than the poor or not, on the other hand, I cannot answer. </p>
<p>Now, another point. I had a few posts pointing out that in my opinion, many donations to religious organizations are <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/liberals-conservatives-charity-and.html">very different from charity</a> regardless of how the law treats them. I realize that not all readers agree, but I think its supported by the facts. Regardless, the biggest jumps in religion’s share of the charity dollar have occurred under GW, Reagan, and Carter. Arguably, these are the Presidents most associated with faith in the public mind. So it may be that the President’s bully pulpit influences how charitable dollars get allocated.</p>
<p>Next post in the Comparing Presidents series… it just occurred to me, I haven’t looked at the stock market!</p>

                                <p>The term Rudy McRomney usually refers to the pandering Siamese triplet that consists of Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and Mitt Romney but John McCain has no blame in the flip flopping garbage reported <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/08/21/romney.immigration.ad/index.html">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney Tuesday stepped up his ongoing attack on cities with what he calls sanctuary policies for illegal immigrants &#8211; including rival Rudy Giuliani&#8217;s home city &#8211; with a new radio ad set to air in crucial campaign states Iowa and New Hampshire.  &#8220;Immigration laws don&#8217;t work if they&#8217;re ignored,&#8221; the ad&#8217;s announcer states. &#8220;That&#8217;s the problem with cities like Newark, San Francisco and New York City that adopt sanctuary policies. Sanctuary cities become magnets that encourage illegal immigration and undermine secure borders.&#8221;  The two GOP front-runners have been locked in a war of words over the issue after Romney claimed Giuliani supported illegal immigration while mayor. Giuliani has repeatedly denied the charge, arguing instead he cracked down on illegal immigrants while mayor.  Giuliani has repeatedly denied the charge, arguing instead he cracked down on illegal immigrants while mayor.  A Giuliani aide fired back at Romney Tuesday, criticizing him for hiring a landscaping firm that employed illegal immigrants to work at his home.  &#8220;Gov. Romney&#8217;s ad conveniently forgets that his plan to deputize state troopers that never went into effect did absolutely nothing to cut down on the number of illegals working in his yard,&#8221; a Giuliani aide said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hope his plan to secure the borders is more effective than that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>You won’t often hear me praising the Lou Dobbs position on this issue as we disagree 100%.  Dobbs love to shout “illegal” when he refers to people as “aliens”.  But these people are indeed children of God (for our atheist readers, my apologies for injecting my Christian beliefs here but I have to) and the only reason reprehensible assholes like Lou Dobbs can shout illegal as that our immigration laws (the ones that flip-flop Mitt touts) are a mess.  </p>
<p>But my point is not to trash Mr. Dobbs as at least he is consistent.  We know where he stands even if we don’t always agree with him.  These two Republican clowns have been serially flip flopping on just about everything.  So why should I be surprised that they pander to whatever group they appear before on an issue as trivial as the lives of human beings (aka “aliens”)?  After all – this unfortunately has been standard faire for the leaders of the modern Republican party.</p>

                                <p>Hat tip to Laura Wright at <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/onearth/07sum/default.asp">On Earth</a> magazine and NRDC (National Resources Defense Council) for the following link:

<p><a href="http://www.secinfo.com/dS997.34fn.d.htm">CuraGen</a> offers toxigenomic screens.</p>
<blockquote><p>CuraGen&#8217;s industrialized Predictive Toxicogenomics Screen enables inexpensive cellular screening of thousands of compounds annually, and provides results on nine different modes of liver toxicity. Evidence of liver toxicity is one of the primary reasons that drug compounds fail during preclinical development. Nearly 75% of pharmaceutical research and development expenditures are devoted to developing drugs that never reach the market. Detailed information generated by this screen can be used by scientists to prioritize compounds based upon their potential for toxicity, in order to avoid work on compounds that are likely to fail in safety tests later in development.</p>
<p>CuraGen and Bayer scientists developed this unique assay by analyzing more than 100 known toxic compounds and identifying marker genes whose activity correlates with specific modes of liver toxicity. These genes have been subcategorized into<br />marker sets predictive of nine specific liver histopathologies, including cholestasis, necrosis, or hypertrophy, and have been affixed to gene expression microarrays for use in high-throughput comparative analysis. Drug compounds under review are applied in extremely small quantities to primary hepatocyte cells in vitro. The cellular activity of these dosed compounds is then evaluated against the proprietary toxicity markers. The results of this comparison provide scientists with a rank-ordered list of compounds based upon their potential for toxicity, which can be used in determining which compounds have the highest likelihood for successful clinical development.</p>
<p>CuraGen Corporation has been a pioneer in the field of pharmacogenomics, which includes the study of how drugs work, why drugs fail, and which characteristics are indicative of drug toxicity. CuraGen&#8217;s expertise stems from pharmacogenomic research conducted with many of the world&#8217;s leading pharmaceutical companies in prioritizing portions of their drug pipelines.</p>
<p>CuraGen Corporation (NASDAQ: CRGN) is a genomics-based pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>More thoughts:</p>
<p>1) Is there a moral obligation of private companies to invest in public health as part of their own product development? If the current regulatory structure is not even knowledgeable about the issue as part of the public forum, is this wise?</p>
<p>2) In light of the US experience with Chinese products and safety, is it useful to wait for the EU regulations on cosmetics to take effect in the US instead of being more pro-active? Revlon and L&#8217;Oreal have volunteered to comply with EU rules and also sell the same to the US, but other companies have not, so known toxins remain in the market.</p>
<p>3) How do you see the balances of interests happening in the future?</p>
<p>More thoughts?</p>

<p><a href="http://nymag.com/news/businessfinance/bottomline/35813/">This</a> is the best summary I&#8217;ve seen of something significant happening in our economy <em>right now</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>You&#8217;re losing money right now. This very minute. You&#8217;re losing money if you own an apartment. You&#8217;re losing money if you own a country home. You&#8217;re losing money if you own a stock or bond mutual fund. You&#8217;re losing money if you have a pension plan. You&#8217;re probably losing money here or there, you&#8217;re probably losing money everywhere (except maybe from your savings account and wallet). But this is no Dr. Seuss story. It&#8217;s more of a John Steinbeck tale, and we are the victims, a new generation of Tom Joads, and it&#8217;s the damn bankermen who broke us. No, there won&#8217;t be a police officer to investigate, and the government, at least this federal government, won&#8217;t save us.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Where did the money come from? Banks lent it, mortgage brokers lent it, and even home builders themselves got into the act. The housing markets were so hot the lenders barely had time to check if their buyers were deadbeats, cheats, speculators, or actual honest-to-Betsy hardworking people who wanted nothing more than what Tom Joad wanted 70 years ago. Oh, and the buyers didn&#8217;t have time to check out the terms, either; the value of the houses was going up too fast. Gotta close now! Nor did the regulators tap the brakes; whoops, there were no regulators. If something went wrong, who cares? The buyers could always sell their ever-appreciating home to the next guy on the reservation list or the ten after him. The builders, brokers, and bankers then shipped these mortgages east to the big Wall Street firms, which bundled them together and merchandised them as high-yielding bonds often backed up by nothing more than the full faith and credit of, well, no one.</p></blockquote>
<p>I disagree with the author (I doubt it&#8217;s really Cramer) in blaming Greenspan and the regulators.  Bubbles seem to be an unfortunate product of free markets/capitalism.   Amazingly, I don&#8217;t think there is partisan blame here either.</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pakistani Intelligence ISI in collaboration with Iranian intelligence crafted a unique strategy to fight Baloch nationalists who are waging a deadly guerilla warfare against Pakistani Army in the Balochistan province &#8211; Islamize youth and kill Nationalists &#8211; according to sources in Balochistan . Baloch Nationalists have alerted Western Governments and think tanks abroad about this new development; witnessed by locals, widely circulated in baloch forums, that a promotional gathering of Tabligi was orchestrated under the watchful eyes of ISI on July 31 in Gawadar, the costal city Balochistan. One Mr.Archen Baloch said &#8220;Fanatic mullahism is been promoted proactively in collaboration with insignificant, discarded local mullahs against the Baloch nationalism which seeks the restoration of its national sovereignty over Balochistan. “. This phenomenon suggests that Pakistani intelligence is adding a new dimension to its Counter insurgence strategy to contain Baloch nationalists- who are regarded as secular, unlike other groups. IntelliBriefs sources in Pakistan say such events are &#8220;taking place in all over Balochistan, and this phenomenon suggest a new conspiracy against Baloch nationalist&#8221; and is also considered as &#8220;second force of Pakistani government after its armed force”.</p>
<p>While one need not be surprised about strong alliance between ISI and Islamic groups ,it is believed that ISI has activated its network of Mullahs to counter Baloch Nationalists after the failure of Pakistani army to crush the Baloch Resistance . Now Pakistan &#8221; wants dilute the intensity of Baloch nationalism by mobilizing the religious elements in our society&#8221; said Archen Baloch . All these activities are funded by ISI and spearheaded by Mr.Mulana Sherani ,member of Pakistan national assembly and he heads JUI in Balochistan .</p>
<p>On Iranian side of Balochistan ,Abdolmalik Rigi&#8217;s open revolt against Iran has forced Iranians to use Mullahs as weapons against Baloch Nationalists . Iranian officials are spending sleepless nights over the unrest in its Sistan Balochistan Province which shares border with Pakistani side of Balochistan . Sources say Baloch are facing harassment by Iranian officials at the border who visit their relatives on the other side of the border in the Iran . They say &#8220;we have to go through harsh security by Pasdarane Inqalab, the Revolutionary Guard.&#8221; . IntelliBriefs learned that those who want to participate in religious gathering in Pakistani held Balochistan face no restrictions, they can pass the boarder without any document or &#8220;Rahdari&#8221; permit.</p>

<blockquote><p>The families of the Crandall Canyon miner&#8217;s aren&#8217;t the only ones raising questions about the handling of the rescue effort.</p>
<p>Many news organizations and blogs are also now asking questions about the governments role and the man chosen to lead the rescue effort, Mine and Health Safety Administrator, Richard Stickler. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Increasing attention is now being paid to Stickler, the federal government&#8217;s main mine man. </p>
<p>Stickler used to be a mining executive who &#8211; according to various media reports &#8211; ran mines which had several fatalities and &#8220;&#8230;an incident rate that was often twice the national average.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Also coming to light, is the fact that Stickler&#8217;s nomination to head the mine administration was twice rejected by congress and rejected when republicans were still in charge. </p>
<p>Rejected reportedly by senators who were concerned about Stickler&#8217;s safety record when he operated mines. </p>
<p>After his nomination was twice rejected by the Senate, President Bush gave Richard Stickler the mine safety job with a recess appointment. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>A Republican nominee by a Republican President rejected by a Republican Congress? How incompetent was this guy?</p>
<p>ABC News now notes it took the mine safety administration two days to take public control of the Crandall Canyon Mine. </p>
<p>ABC also adds, &#8220;Others were irate that [mine owner Bob] Murray was allowed to publicly predict success and contradict MSHA itself while agency officials quietly looked on.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>This business of putting incompetent people in charge of things is like a theme for this administration, isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;ve said it before, I&#8217;ll say it again&#8230; this administration is qualitatively different from any previous one I remember. And when the people at the very top are so incompetent that they cannot recognize the difference between quality and crap, they tend to fill their organization with other incompetent people. So we end up with incompetent people being in charge of a range of things, from planning a war to running the economy or being National Security Advisor or being in charge of the USDA or FEMA. Now, most of these things more or less run themselves to some degree, but every so often, not having someone who knows what&#8217;s going on in charge makes one heck of a difference.</p>
