                                <p>ILSM notes that some of the cheerleaders for the Iraq War have taken to blaming Walter Conkite for losing Vietnam.  So he sends this&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>The following is transcript from Walter Cronkite reporting from Vietnam in Feb 1968. </p>
<p>Tet One was just winding down.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tonight, back in more familiar surroundings in New York, we&#8217;d like to sum up our findings in Vietnam, an analysis that must be speculative, personal, subjective. Who won and who lost in the great Tet offensive against the cities? I&#8217;m not sure. The Vietcong did not win by a knockout, but neither did we. The referees of history may make it a draw. Another standoff may be coming in the big battles expected south of the Demilitarized Zone. Khesanh could well fall, with a terrible loss in American lives, prestige and morale, and this is a tragedy of our stubbornness there; but the bastion no longer is a key to the rest of the northern regions, and it is doubtful that the American forces can be defeated across the breadth of the DMZ with any substantial loss of ground. Another standoff. On the political front, past performance gives no confidence that the Vietnamese government can cope with its problems, now compounded by the attack on the cities. It may not fall, it may hold on, but it probably won&#8217;t show the dynamic qualities demanded of this young nation. Another standoff.</p>
<p>We have been too often disappointed by the optimism of the American leaders, both in Vietnam and Washington, to have faith any longer in the silver linings they find in the darkest clouds. They may be right, that Hanoi&#8217;s winter-spring offensive has been forced by the Communist realization that they could not win the longer war of attrition, and that the Communists hope that any success in the offensive will improve their position for eventual negotiations. It would improve their position, and it would also require our realization, that we should have had all along, that any negotiations must be that-negotiations, not the dictation of peace terms. For it seems now more certain than ever that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in a stalemate. This summer&#8217;s almost certain standoff will either end in real give-and-take negotiations or terrible escalation; and for every means we have to escalate, the enemy can match us, and that applies to invasion of the North, the use of nuclear weapons, or the mere commitment of one hundred, or two hundred, or three hundred thousand more American troops to the battle. And with each escalation, the world comes closer to the brink of cosmic disaster.</p>
<p>To say that we are closer to victory today is to believe, in the face of the evidence, the optimists who have been wrong in the past. To suggest we are on the edge of defeat is to yield to unreasonable pessimism. To say that we are mired in stalemate seems the only realistic, yet unsatisfactory, conclusion. On the off chance that military and political analysts are right, in the next few months we must test the enemy&#8217;s intentions, in case this is indeed his last big gasp before negotiations. But it is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.</p>
<p>This is Walter Cronkite. Good night.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pretty similar to what is happening today. The military can keep from losing, make some illusory gains and say it is winning, the war machine profit motives can keep the political war at home under control.</p>
<p>But they cannot win the political war in the enemies capitol!</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton caught this the other day, admitting the surge has some apparent success, but it does not mean a thing if the politics does not get going.</p>

<blockquote><p>Rudolph W. Giuliani has been broadcasting radio advertisements in Iowa and other states far from the city he once led stating that as mayor of New York, he “turned a $2.3 billion deficit into a multibillion dollar surplus.” The assertion, which Mr. Giuliani has repeated on the trail as he has promoted his fiscal conservatism, is somewhat misleading, independent fiscal monitors said. In fact, Mr. Giuliani left his successor, Michael R. Bloomberg, with a bigger deficit than the one Mr. Giuliani had to deal with when he arrived in 1994. And that deficit would have been large even if the city had not been attacked on Sept. 11, 2001. “He inherited a gap, and he left a gap for his successor,” Ronnie Lowenstein, the director of the city’s Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that monitors the city budget, said of Mr. Giuliani. “The city was budgeting as though the good times were not going to end, but sooner or later they always do.” … Mr. Giuliani’s eight years of fiscal stewardship of the city was initially marked by a new brand of conservative budgeting principles in which he cut spending, cut taxes and cut the payroll. Later, when the booming stock market of the late 1990s pumped revenues into the city’s coffers, Mr. Giuliani was able to cut taxes, increase spending above the rate of inflation, and still post big surpluses. But the economy cooled near the end of Mr. Giuliani’s second term, and he spent most of the roughly $3 billion surplus he had accumulated to balance his final budget, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002. Even before the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Giuliani projected that his successor would face a $2.8 billion gap the next year. After the attacks, that gap climbed to $4.8 billion in a $42.3 billion budget. Faced with such a huge deficit, which continued to grow as the economic aftershocks of the attacks continued and the costs of some of the Giuliani administration’s policies came due, the next mayor, Mr. Bloomberg, was forced to take the extraordinary steps of borrowing to pay for operating expenses, cutting programs, and raising property taxes by 18.5 percent to balance the budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rudy defenders might say that he did not create the 2001 recession.  But as we noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/rudy-tries-to-take-credit-for-clinton.html">here</a> &#8211; Rudy was the sole cause of the Clinton boom.  Seriously – the leader in the GOP race for the Presidential nomination is even dumber than those National Review nitwits,</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118800635034508655.html">Bruce Bartlett</a> is one of my favorite conservatives for reasons like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>For those who never heard about it, the FairTax is a national retail sales tax that would replace the entire current federal tax system. It was originally devised by the Church of Scientology in the early 1990s as a way to get rid of the Internal Revenue Service, with which the church was then at war (at the time the IRS refused to recognize it as a legitimate religion).</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that is something I did not know.  Bruce is not a fan of the current version of this political fraud. It seems that Senator Chambliss has joined his fellow Georgia wingnut Representative John Linder with some incredible claims:</p>
<blockquote><p>They assert that a rate of 23% would be sufficient to replace federal individual and corporate income taxes as well as payroll and estate taxes. Mr. Linder&#8217;s Web site claims that U.S. gross domestic product will rise 10.5% the first year after enactment, exports will grow by 26%, and real investment spending will increase an astonishing 76%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bruce also notes some fuzzy math being practiced by these clowns:</p>
<blockquote><p>If a product costs $1 at retail, the FairTax adds 30%, for a total of $1.30. Since the 30-cent tax is 23% of $1.30, FairTax supporters say the rate is 23% rather than 30%. This is only the beginning of the deceptions in the FairTax. Under the Linder-Chambliss bill, the federal government would have to pay taxes to itself on all of its purchases of goods and services. Thus if the Defense Department buys a tank that now costs $1 million, the manufacturer would have to add the FairTax</p></blockquote>
<p>Even with all of this, their FairTax will not be revenue neutral unless the tax rate was set at 57 percent.  Is Saxby Chambliss trying to make Zell Miller look good by comparison?</p>

<p>I think I have an answer to the question <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/11-growth.html">Cactus</a> posed in regards the claim from <a href="http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=11814">R. Emmett Tyrell </a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the past five years, per capita gross domestic product has grown at 11%. We are living through a vast global economic boom, and the Democrats seem completely unawares. In 2008 their presidential candidate will be moaning that we have lost a war and are economically in a hell of a mess. The Republican will only have to point to a healthy economy and the success of General Petraeus&#8217;s splendid army to win. Then the Democrats will whine that the Republicans stole the election from them. That is my prediction, and I base it on the evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cactus and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/r-emmett-tyrell-has-money-illusion.html">yours truly</a> need to rephrase our questions.  Instead of asking Mr. Tyrell why not adjusted inflation, the question should have been – did you adjust for inflation.  It turns out he tried to so if I had asked if he has money illusion, the answer would be no.  Mr. Tyrell is at least guilty of unclear writing and failing to provide his sources.  And as we shall see, his math skills are poor.  </p>
<p>Our table compares 2007QII to 2002QII in terms of nominal GDP per capita, which is given by line 1 of table 7.1 from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">this source</a>.  It turns out that nominal GDP per capita rose by 25.73 percent, which prices rose by 15 percent.  So I guess Mr. Tyrell took the difference between nominal growth (n) and the growth of prices (p) to get real growth (r).  Let’s see: 25.73% minus 15% = 10.73% and rounding up.  But that’s not the right way to do this.  The correct formula is (n – p)/(1 + p) = 10.73%/1.15 = 9.32%.  Of course, we could have gone directly to line 6 of table 7.1.  </p>
<p>Besides bad writing and poor math skills, it would seem Mr. Tyrell has trouble putting things into a longer-term perspective – which gives me an excuse to graph real GDP per capita from 1997.  The graph shows something that is not surprising to most people who have followed the US economy.  After the late 1990’s boom in real income per person, we saw real income per person actually decline during the first one and a half years of the Bush Administration. Think about this way, real income per person as of 2007QII was only 9.22 percent higher than it was as of 2000QIV.  It would seem that a 9.2 percent increase over 6.5 years sounds a lot less dramatic than an 11% increase over 5 years.  During the last 6.5 years of the Clinton Administration, real income per capita grew by 17.3 percent.  </p>
<p>We should also note that real income per person represents the mean not the median.  The Census Bureau reports the median household income in 2005 CPI-U-RS adjusted dollars for 2005 was only $46,326 (less than $40, 3000 in 2000$).  So the median family is receiving less than 10 percent more income than the average person.  The $46,326 was less than the real median income for 2000, which was $47,671.  It would seem whatever real per capita income growth we are getting is accruing to the well to do and not the median household.  But would one expect Mr. Tyrell to both recognize this reality and to be honest to his readers about it?</p>

                                <p>Regular readers know I have written a large number of posts on how Presidents since Ike have performed at various tasks, from economic growth to cutting the rate of abortions. But what is the President&#8217;s job? What&#8217;s he supposed to do?</p>
<p>I wandered over to the White House page, and clicked on the tab that reads &#8220;president&#8221;. That took me <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/">here</a> where I was greeted by this:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtBey09FIcI/AAAAAAAAAog/A8yPY7W7Yps/s1600-h/titlebar.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtBey09FIcI/AAAAAAAAAog/A8yPY7W7Yps/s320/titlebar.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d have picked a picture that didn&#8217;t make him look so much like Alfred E. Neuman, but then you&#8217;d be wrong&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtBg8U9FIdI/AAAAAAAAAoo/pcb0PnhBYUE/s1600-h/alfred+e+neuman.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtBg8U9FIdI/AAAAAAAAAoo/pcb0PnhBYUE/s320/alfred+e+neuman.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>But nowhere here there&#8217;s anything about what the President does, what he is supposed to do, or what are his duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Constitution gives a list of things the President can do: signing laws, vetoing bills, create a Cabinet, and (this one is special for Scooter Libby) grant reprieves and pardons. There are also some things he does with the advise and consent of the Senate: nominate ambassadors, judges, make treaties, etc.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also chief executive of the Executive Branch, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. The only thing it seems to me he is required to do, though, is take an oath of office (to uphold the Constitution) and to give an annual address to Congress about what he thinks is going on.</p>
<p>But people expect more than that from the President. Most people want him (or her) to take steps their lives better. This includes making the economy stronger and seeing to it the government provides services they desire. Heck, some people want the President to <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bal-op.contraception21aug21,0,7842827.story">outlaw most forms of birth control</a>.</p>
<p>And Presidential candidates clearly are willing to promise all these things. </p>
<p>So what is the role of the President? What should it be?</p>

                                <p>Some months ago, there was a bit of back and forth in magazines (and blogs) about whether or not Bill Clinton could run as VP on someone&#8217;s ticket, presumably with Hillary. The answer, of course, seems to be no &#8211; after all, he isn&#8217;t eligible to be President again.</p>
<p>But could he take another position in the line of succession? I imagine so. Moreover, my guess is that if Hillary were to become President, one of the wisest things she can do is make the Big Dog Secretary of State. He is widely admired abroad (i.e., he&#8217;s no Condi Rice), and he&#8217;d carry with him cachet at a level no Secretary of State has carried so far. Dealing with the Secretary of State of the US, rather than the President, would make other parties think of those negotiations as carrying a lot of importance with the US government (i.e., he&#8217;s no Condi Rice). Additionally, he was famous for doing his homework, reducing the odds of a screw-up (i.e., he&#8217;s no Condi Rice). Finally, of course, keeping him traveling and busy also keeps him away from spending time with the interns&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s important to understand that the Republican Party is mostly an organized conspiracy to redistribute wealth upwards, that deceit is an essential element of their M.O., that the conservative movement is fundamentally radical and dangerous, that the national media have done an abysmal job of covering politics and policy, and that the Bush administration has overturned the basic norms of governance that have prevailed for decades</p></blockquote>
<p>And the Amazon review states:</p>
<blockquote><p>This book traces the roots of his dislike back 30 years, when supply-side economics took over the Republican Party and made cutting taxes the GOP answer to all political and economic questions. American politics has been hijacked by a tiny coterie of right-wing economic extremists, Chait declares, some of them ideological zealots, others merely greedy, a few of them possibly insane. To which he adds, the Republicans&#8217; success at defeating the democratic process explains why it has been able to enact its agenda despite a lack of popular support. The rhetoric is inflammatory, but the case is laid out with clarity. Chait claims that traditional Republicans, religious people and social, fiscal and foreign policy conservatives have been cheated as much as liberals, and that unparalleled corruption and ruthless cynicism in Washington and the timidity of nonpartisan media allow the minority to rule. His analysis should appeal to anyone interested in politics, though many may find the style too irritating to endure.</p></blockquote>
<p>After all the irritating and insufferable stupidity from the practitioners of CrackpotEconomics, I’m rushing out to buy my copy of Mr. Chait’s books. A big thank you to Brad for bringing this book to our attention.</p>

<blockquote><p>If their calls for retreat gain no support from the electorate, perhaps they will change the subject to another of their favorite misconceptions, to wit, the economy is going to hell. Actually, the economy is chugging along in a healthy and protracted period of growth. For the past five years, per capita gross domestic product has grown at 11%. We are living through a vast global economic boom, and the Democrats seem completely unawares. In 2008 their presidential candidate will be moaning that we have lost a war and are economically in a hell of a mess. The Republican will only have to point to a healthy economy and the success of General Petraeus&#8217;s splendid army to win. Then the Democrats will whine that the Republicans stole the election from them. That is my prediction, and I base it on the evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>I did leave off most of his rant as to how we are winning the war in Iraq but we Democrats are just too stupid to recognize it.  After all, Cactus did ask:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why not adjust for inflation?</p></blockquote>
<p>Cactus was also trying to reproduce over what five-year period that nominal per capita GDP actually rose by 15 percent.  I’m not sure either but I did check the GDP deflator for 2007QII versus the GDP deflator for 20022QII using table1.1.9 of <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">this source</a>.  It would seem prices have risen by 15 percent over the past five years.  So real per capita GDP fell by about 4 percent and Mr. Tyrell is so unaware of the distinction between nominal income and real income that he thinks the economy is booming?  OK, Lawrence Kudlow makes the same mistake routinely.  The founder of the American Spectator is as stupid as those nitwits at the National Review!  Go figure!</p>

Craig links to an article in <a href="http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=11814">American Spectator by R. Emmett Tyrrell</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Actually, the economy is chugging along in a healthy and protracted period of growth. For the past five years, per capita gross domestic product has grown at 11%. We are living through a vast global economic boom, and the Democrats seem completely unawares. In 2008 their presidential candidate will be moaning that we have lost a war and are economically in a hell of a mess.

Then the Democrats will whine that the Republicans stole the election from them. That is my prediction, and I base it on the evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t dispute the very large possibility that the Dems will engage in some form of stupidity and lose the 2008 presidential election.  And with luck, both the economy and Iraq will look a bit better by next year.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t understand this statement at all: &#8220;per capita gross domestic product has grown at 11%.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave out the obvious questions&#8230; Why not adjust for inflation?  How does that compare to any other five year stretch?  Does the author&#8217;s first name also have a two or more sets of duplicate letters in a row?  No&#8230; my question is what does he mean?  That&#8217;s the percentage change over five years?  Annualized?  What is he talking about?</p>
<p>From line 1 of <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">NIPA Table 7.1</a>, we learn that GDP per capita (to use his measure) was  $35,476, in 2002 it was $36,296, in 2003 it was $37,626, in 2004 it was $39,735, in 2005 it was 41,869, and in 2006 it was $44,007.  </p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m missing something obvious, but I&#8217;ve played with the numbers two or three times over the past few days and I just can&#8217;t find that 11% over five years.  The best I can do&#8230; $44,007 (i.e., 2006&#8217;s value) is about 11% greater than $39,735 (2004&#8217;s value).  Similarly, the change from 2003 to 2005 is about 11%.  But that doesn&#8217;t strike me as what the guy means (especially since that relationship doesn&#8217;t hold for any other two year stretch involving GW.)</p>
<p>Someone tell me what I&#8217;m missing here.</p>

                                <p>Given the recent revisionism of the Vietnam War, I found this Op Ed by <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-brooks24aug24,1,7610339.column?ctrack=1&#038;cset=true">Rosa Brooks</a> to make a lot of sense&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>To Bush, the &#8220;unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America&#8217;s withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Bush went on to assert that &#8220;another price to our withdrawal from Vietnam&#8221; was the rise of &#8220;the enemy we face in today&#8217;s struggle, those who came to our soil and killed thousands of citizens&#8221; on 9/11.</p>
<p>Yup &#8212; it&#8217;s so obvious! The U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam caused the rise of Al Qaeda &#8212; and, by extension, &#8220;our withdrawal from Vietnam&#8221; ultimately turned Iraq into &#8220;the central front&#8221; in &#8220;the war on terror.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>How can we show the innocent civilians of Southeast Asia that we haven&#8217;t forgotten them and simultaneously send a message of resolve to the Iraqi people? How can we show Al Qaeda once and for all that the U.S. is not to be trifled with? &#8230;  Re-invade Vietnam.</p></blockquote>
