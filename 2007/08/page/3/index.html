                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Given the recent Larry Craig story, and how much it resembles a lot of other stories in recent months, I started thinking about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/are-americans-becoming-less-honest.html">a post</a> in which I remarked&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>(if someone else has said this before, forgive me, if not, I’ll be happy to claim this as “cactus’ 1st law”) that those who talk a lot about ethics, morality, or patriotism generally have none.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since nobody has claimed it yet, I&#8217;m going to claim it once and for all as cactus&#8217; first law. </p>
<p>Which leads to the following thoughts. The Republican party bills itself as the party of family and morality. As per cactus&#8217; first law, over the past decade there have been a whole bunch of Republicans snagged for sex scandals. (Several were in the forefront of making jabs at Clinton, thus adding hypocrisy into the mix.) This includes elected representatives, as well as officials of the Republican Party. And a seemingly high proportion of these scandals involve homosexual conduct, which seems to the big no-no if you listen to what Republicans say. </p>
<p>(I&#8217;m focusing on sex and morality, but of course we all can come up with examples in other areas&#8230;)</p>
<p>So a few questions&#8230;</p>
<p>1. How often does cactus&#8217; first law hold?<br />2. How can you differentiate a true believer (in whatever area) from a violator of cactus&#8217; first law? (My guess&#8230; the true believers are the ones who are quiet about, hence the phrasing of the law.) <br />3. In what way are the Democrats living up (or down) to cactus&#8217; first law?</p>

                                <p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with her, Ann Telnaes is a very talented political cartoonist (Pulitzer Prize recipient). I check her site (http://www.anntelnaes.com/) every few days. Striking is I never see her referenced on the blogs I&#8217;d expect to, like AB. Thought you might like to view her latest, as of Sunday, in case you hadn&#8217;t seen it. It complements recent posts on AB.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A friend of mine ran a search for the terms &#8220;real gdp per capita&#8221; and &#8220;tax rates&#8221; on google.  He wanted to find out what tax rates lead to fastest real economic growth.  The top two hits were <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/tax-rates-real-gdp-growth-rates-and.html">this</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/tax-rates-tax-cuts-and-growth-of-gdp.html">this</a>, two posts I wrote.  And when he saw those, he remembered that I&#8217;ve had a few others along the way.</p>
<p>So he called me up, congratulated on my status as a minor authority, and then noted that this speaks poorly of the field of economics.  I tend to agree.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not an academic, nor am I with a think tank, nor do I advise any politician or party or whatever.  I am trained as an economist, but I haven&#8217;t yet done any consulting work of a political or macro-economic nature.  (Note &#8211; I&#8217;d love to get involved with political consulting, but I haven&#8217;t figured out how to market myself to those who hire people for that sort of work.)   My work, if you want it call it that, on Angry Bear, is a hobby, done in what little spare time I have.</p>
<p>And this issue, the issue of how high taxes should be, is potentially the most important one in macroeconomics.  Taxes are a necessary evil &#8211; they fund government.   Government, in turn, isn&#8217;t important for its own sake &#8211; its just a social construct after all, but it is important for what it can do for society.  Someone has to build bridges, provide a legal system, and keep the damn Canadian hordes at bay.  All of these things, and more, are necessary to a well-functioning society, not to mention a well-functioning economy, and all of them cost money.  And that money comes from one of three places:  its either taken from the citizenry in the form of taxes, its taken from the future citizenry in the form of futures taxes (i.e., its borrowed), or (God help us), its printed.  (Since the latter is such a bad option, I&#8217;m going to disregard it for the rest of this post.)  Each of these options slows down the economy to some extent.  Thus, it is vital to find the optimal balance &#8211; that level of government (and of taxation &#8211; today or tomorrow) that is best at making us all collectively better off.  </p>
<p>To some extent, that translates to&#8230; at this point in time, given current conditions, is the government more or less efficient than the private sector at producing growth from a marginal dollar?  For a lot of people, the answer to that question is a reflexive one &#8211; at any level of taxation, cutting taxes produces faster growth.   And like all reflexive answers, its mostly wrong.  But like many reflexive answers, its an attractive one &#8211; its easy (&#8220;of course the private sector is more efficient than the DMV&#8221;), and it provides a convenient excuse for one&#8217;s own failings (&#8220;I would be doing so much better if only the gubmint stayed out of business&#8221;).  But it doesn&#8217;t fit the facts.  If it did, the many very well funded right wing think tanks would be pumping out study at study showing precisely that &#8211; not that they aren&#8217;t already &#8211; but those studies wouldn&#8217;t be so carefully parsed and shaded.  </p>
<p>All of which raises the question&#8230; where is everyone else?  Where is the left, and more importantly, where is the middle?  Why have the professionals ignored one of the most important questions in society, leaving it to the crackpots, the nutjobs, and bloggers (of course, there is some overlap between the three groups)?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>BTW&#8230; my friend points to <a href="http://pfr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/32/3/292">this study</a> (similar to another blog post of mine, in fact) as one of the few examples of professional quality research that he&#8217;s managed to find.  What else is out there?  Anyone have suggestions?</p>

                                <p>Max Sawicky used to call Alan Greenspan “Yoda”.  When I saw <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/003265.html">this post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>With regret I have to announce that my blogging days will end on September 3. New professional responsibilities will preclude any public pontificating. Aside from professional articles, the scope for my publishing activities is not yet clear. There may turn out to be none.</p></blockquote>
<p>I thought of the destruction of <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/location/alderaan">Alderaan</a> in the first Star Wars movie and how Ob-Wan reacted to it:</p>
<blockquote><p>I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, Max is only one of the economist bloggers and not millions.  But he is one that many of us used to turn to for inspiration.  Good luck in the new job Max!  We’ll miss your insights and your humor.</p>

                                <p>First, Karl Rove resigns &#8211; and now it is <a href="http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1656544,00.html?cnn=yes">Gonzo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bush&#8217;s chief of staff has asked anyone in the Administration who is planning to leave before the end of Bush&#8217;s presidency to let him know before Labor Day this year. And the departure also comes conveniently at the tail end of the August doldrums, with Washington still on summer recess and much of the country on vacation. Better to make the move now, the White House figured, than wait for Congress to return and perhaps renew its campaign to oust Gonzales. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to make a decision with the tip of a bayonet in your face,&#8221; says a former senior official.  Some White House watchers are pointing to another factor in Gonzales&#8217;s departure: the resignation earlier this month of Bush&#8217;s longtime adviser, Karl Rove.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rove is getting out of Dodge for the same reason Gonzo is getting out.  The Congressional inquiries are getting too hot for this White House.  There is still a week to go before Labor Day – so let’s just sit back and watch for what other Administration rats bail out.</p>

                                <p>Reader Ken Melvin sends along an idea. My brain is just too fuzzy this morning to speculate, so I haven&#8217;t thought through the ramifications, but it does seem intriguing&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Rather the Fed bailing out Market Street on the housing bubble, suppose the government implemented a scheme that tied the payments for those homeowner’s mortgages facing foreclosure to the home’s current value and stipulated that the rate of interest for the loan always be within a small margin of prime. </p>
<p>An example-model: Say that a homeowner purchase a home for $500k with 20% down leaving a principal of $400k financed initially with an ARM at 6% resulting in interest payments of $24k/yr or $2k/mo. If the interest rate went to 8%, the interest payments would be $32k/yr or $2.67/mo. All well and good if the price of the home continues to go up. Thus, the speculative bubble. But, if the price of the house went down 10% to $450k , the principal 0.8 x $450 = $360k and the $32k/yr is now 8.88% . Little incentive for the homeowner here. But, if the above scheme were implemented and the prime remained the same, the interest payments would be 0.06 x $360k = $21.6/yr or $1.8/mo. Unless they’ve suffered other losses, the homeowners would try their best to hang in there. A major consequence of this scheme is that the lenders are partnered in, making them less likely to fuel the speculative bubble. If applied in a perhaps somewhat modified form during those times when housing prices are rising too rapidly, the scheme could be used to take off some of the speculative edge that leads to bubbles.</p>

                                <p>As the rightwing seems to think we liberals protesting the Vietnam War led President Nixon to chicken out in 1973 (at perhaps the height of Nixon’s political popularity), let’s go back about five years as to what President Johnson&#8217;s advisors were telling him in early 1968 as to the implications of the <a href="http://www.vwam.com/vets/tet/tet.html">Tet offensive</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Tet Offensive and Khe Sanh may well have reminded Johnson and Westmoreland of the Duke of Wellington&#8217;s dictum: &#8220;If there&#8217;s anything more melancholy than a battle lost, it&#8217;s a battle won&#8221;. Giap had been frustrated at Khe Sanh and defeated in South Vietnam&#8217;s cities. NVA/VC dead totaled some 45,000 and the number of prisoners nearly 7000. But the shockwave of the battle finished Johnson&#8217;s willingness to carry on. Westmoreland was pressuring Washington for 206,000 troops to carry on the campaign in the South and to make a limited invasion of North Vietnam just above the DMZ. As the battle for Hue died out, Johnson asked Clark Clifford (who had recently replaced a disillusioned McNamara as Secretary of Defense) to find ways and means of meeting Westmoreland&#8217;s request.</p>
<p>Clifford and an advisor group looked at the war to date, and among others, consulted CIA Director Richard Helms who presented the Agency&#8217;s gloomy forecasts in great detail. On March 4th Clifford told Johnson that the war was far from won and that more men would make little difference. Johnson then turned to his chief group of informal advisors (which included among others, Generals Omar Bradley, Matthew Ridgway, and Maxwell Taylor; Cyrus Vance, Dean Acheson, and Henry Cabot Lodge). Johnson soon found that they too, like Clifford, had turned against the war. According to Thomas Powers, Johnson&#8217;s &#8220;wise old men&#8221; had been told that recent CIA studies showed that the pacification programme was failing in forty of South Vietnam&#8217;s forty-four provinces and that the NLF&#8217;s manpower was actually twice the number that had been estimated previously. Not only had Tet shown that the optimism of the previous year had been an illusion, but it now seemed that the enemy was far stronger than anybody had thought, and that the long efforts to win Vietnamese &#8220;hearts and minds&#8221; had largely been a disaster. </p>
<p>If Tet wasn&#8217;t a full-scale shock to the American public, it was at the very least, an awakening. The enemy that Johnson and the generals had described as moribund had shown itself to be very alive and, as yet, unbeaten. America and its ARVN ally had suffered over 4,300 killed in action, some 16,000 wounded and over 1,000 missing in action. The fact that the enemy suffered far more and had lost a major gamble mattered little, because the war looked like a never ending conflict without any definite, realistic objective. The scenes of desolation in Saigon, Hue, and other cities looked to be war without purpose or end. Perhaps the most quoted US officer of the time was the one who explained the destruction of about one-third of the provincial capital of Ben Tre with unintended black humor: &#8220;It became necessary to destroy it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;in order to save it&#8221;. For many, this oft-quoted statement was not just a classic example of Pentagon double-think but also a symbol of the war&#8217;s futility. Westmoreland became the parody &#8220;General Waste-mor-land&#8221; of the anti-war movement. </p>
<p>Being against the war became more-or-less politically respectable for liberal elements. Robert Kennedy spoke of giving up the illusion of victory, and Democratic Senator Eugene McCarthy challenged Johnson for the Presidential nomination on a peace platform. He was supported by thousands of students and young Americans opposed to the war. Vocal elements of the extreme right largely supported the war, but condemned the Administration for not going all out for victory. The JCS backed Westmoreland but convinced him to settle for half of the over 200,000 additional troops he wanted to take the initiative. The JCS then reported to the White House that the extra men were needed to get things back to normal following the battles of the Tet Offensive. </p>
<p>Johnson&#8217;s dilemma was complete. He couldn&#8217;t meet the generals&#8217; manpower requests without either depleting Europe of American troops &#8211; which was unacceptable &#8211; or calling up the active reserves &#8211; which would have been a political disaster. His most senior advisors had turned against the war and Johnson took another briefing from the CIA analyst whose gloomy reports had soured some of his most hawkish counselors. A few days after this briefing, Johnson went on TV to announce a bombing halt of the North and America&#8217;s willingness to meet with the North Vietnamese to seek a peace settlement. Johnson then said that he was not a candidate for reelection under any circumstances and would spend the rest of his term in a search for peace in Indochina. </p>
<p>One of those present at the special CIA briefing which convinced Johnson that a change of course was inevitable was General Creighton Abrams, Westmoreland&#8217;s deputy commander. Shortly after Johnson&#8217;s turnabout, Abrams replaced Westmoreland as head of US forces in Vietnam. Westmoreland came home to become Army Chief of Staff &#8211; a move many saw as a kick upstairs &#8211; but, whatever the reasons behind the changeover, Abrams went to Saigon with a mission. He was to institute a program of &#8220;Vietnamization&#8221;. In other words, to take all necessary measures to enable the ARVN to bear the main burden of the fighting, and gradually return the chief role of American troops to that of advisors. Vietnamization had always been a feature of America&#8217;s role in Vietnam, but it had been on a back-burner since 1965 when it seemed that Saigon was incapable of doing the job. Now things were to be returned to what they were supposed to have been from the beginning. Vietnamization is usually credited to Nixon, but it began in the wake of the Tet Offensive and Johnson&#8217;s turnabout.</p></blockquote>
<p>The modern day equivalent of Vietnamization is Bush’s “when the Iraqis stand up, we’ll stand down”.  Vietnamization did not work for Nixon as the popular support for the South Vietnamese government never was that strong.  Similarly, the support for the current Iraqi government is quite weak.  But this Administration is damned determined not to learn from history.</p>

                                <p>I happened to catch the opening of President Bush’s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/08/20070825.html">Saturday Radio Address</a> as I was driving my car:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good morning. This week I traveled to Kansas City to address the annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. I spoke about the ideological struggle that our Nation faces in the 21st century, and the lessons we can draw from the advance of freedom in Asia in the 20th century. America&#8217;s enduring presence and perseverance on that continent aided the rise of democracy, helped transform American enemies into American allies, and made our country safer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me apologize to my fellow LA motorists for my near overreaction to this claim that our involvement in the Vietnam War led to a flourishing of democracy in Asia.  Does Bush really think we won that war?  How drunk was he as he was ducking real service in a military uniform?  </p>
<p>The ridiculous spin is a complete 180 from the ridiculous spin that <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_08/011927.php">Kevin Drum</a> highlighted a few days ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are we really going to be forced to seriously debate George Bush&#8217;s Rambo-esque notion that we could have won in Vietnam if only we&#8217;d stuck it out a little longer?</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin complained that the left did not react to Bush’s earlier claim that we lost Vietnam only because of some protests from the Americans who realized how utterly stupid our involvement in Vietnam was.  But how many times do we have to point that the Dominos did not fall.  Ho Chi Minh was not trying to spread Stalinism across Asia.  He was simply trying to rid his nation from the foreign dominations of first the Japanese during World War II, the French after that, and alas our misguided attempts to prop up some pathetic South Vietnamese dictatorship.  </p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/walter-cronkite-and-ilsm-on-february.html">ILSM</a> reminds us of a Walter Cronkite report in early 1968.  President Johnson likely realized after the Tet Offensive that we were not going to defeat Ho Chi Minh and that it was time for a political settlement.  Despite all of Nixon’s “peace with honor” BS during the 1968 campaign, he likely realized that propping up the South Vietnamese dictatorship was a losing cause.  Yet, Nixon dragged out this disaster for another four years before striking a deal with the North Vietnamese.  </p>
<p>Anyone with any sense of the history of Indochina knows that the premise that we were spreading democracy at the point of a gun is completely backwards.  Anyone who followed what happened in the 1960’s and the 1970’s realizes that despite the best efforts of our soldiers, we were going to lose as we were seen as foreign invaders.  So with all history and reality contradicting this we could have won BS, the President’s advisors decided that he should tell us yesterday morning that we actually did win?  They do lie about everything – don’t they?</p>

                                <p>Summary table 1 from <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/85xx/doc8565/08-23-Update07.pdf">this CBO document</a> predicts that we will see Federal surpluses by 2012.  Read down a little further and one sees continuing large on-budget deficits with the real reason for a unified surplus being that we will be adding a lot to the Social Security Trust Fund reserves.  Of course, the Bush crowd does not think those funds should be used to finance your future retirement benefits.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2007/08/a_disappearing.html">Menzie Chinn</a> adds a number of other qualifications to this prediction of Federal surpluses: </p>
<blockquote><p>What is important to remember is that the projections are under current law. One important aspect of this caveat is that this means the provisions of EGTRRA and JGTRRA are allowed to expire in tracing out this scenario, a path that President Bush has opted against. A second point is that the current budget deficit is one being run at full employment</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only does Menzie add the impact of possible future business cycles, he tosses in a couple of pieces of realism with respect to George W. Bush’s appetite to “spend and spend”:</p>
<blockquote><p>To highlight what is more likely, even if the economy maintains relatively healthy growth over the next few years, assume (1) the tax cuts are made permanent, (2) troop levels in Iraq, Afghanistan and other GWOT activities are reduced to 75,000 by 2013, and (3) discretionary spending rises with the growth rate of nominal GDP.</p></blockquote>
<p>Check out his alternative graph of the rising unified deficit.  Let’s keep this in mind as we listen to this White House crowing about how fiscally responsible it has been.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Even when they do something right, this administration has to screw it up. In the past I noted (in the context of Iraq) that since idle hands are the devil&#8217;s workshop, keeping young people occupied is necessary to keep them from listening to those who would incite them to violence. I even went so far as to suggest soccer as a way to do it&#8230; young people the world over seem drawn to soccer, it requires very little equipment (soccer king Pele&#8217;s first ball was a rolled up sock with other socks inside it), and informal soccer games can be played anywhere there is an open space, no matter how small. (Growing up in South America, I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I played &#8220;soccer&#8221; in a hallway or someone&#8217;s courtyard with other kids.)</p>
<p>So this morning I read <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6964564.stm">this</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A demonstration has been held in south- east Afghanistan accusing US troops of insulting Islam after they distributed footballs bearing the name of Allah. </p>
<p>The balls showed the Saudi Arabian flag which features the Koranic declaration of faith. </p>
<p>The US military said the idea had been to give something for Afghan children to enjoy and they did not realise it would cause offence.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Some displayed flags from countries all over the world, including Saudi Arabia, which features the shahada, one of the five pillars of Islam &#8211; the declaration of faith. </p>
<p>The words, which include the name of Allah, are revered, and Muslims are very sensitive about where and how they can be used. </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has complained to the World Cup&#8217;s ruling body in the past about the use of its flag on footballs. </p></blockquote>
<p>Even assuming most Americans don&#8217;t know much about soccer, someone should have remembered this very issue caused a flap a few years ago for McDonalds when they printed the Saudi flag (among others) on paper tray liners. </p>
<p>Fortunately the demonstration was small, and with luck there won&#8217;t be much fallout.</p>
