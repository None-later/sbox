<blockquote><p>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) says the Pentagon cannot track about 30% of the weapons distributed in Iraq over the past three years. </p>
<p>The Pentagon did not dispute the figures, but said it was reviewing arms deliveries procedures</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The GAO reached the estimate &#8211; 111,000 missing AK-47s and 80,000 missing pistols &#8211; by comparing the property records of the Multi-National Security Transition Command for Iraq against records maintained by Gen Petraeus of the arms and equipment he ordered. </p>
<p>Deputy Assistant Defence Secretary Mark Kimmitt told AFP the Pentagon was &#8220;reviewing policies and procedures to ensure US-funded equipment reaches the intended Iraqi security forces under the Iraq program&#8221;. </p></blockquote>
<p> <strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, at the end of July, the US Defence Department admitted that the US-led coalition in Iraq had failed to deliver nearly two-thirds of the equipment it promised to Iraq&#8217;s army. </p>
<p>The Pentagon said only 14.5m of the nearly 40m items of equipment ordered by the Iraqi army had been provided. </p></blockquote>
<p>Ah for the good old days, when former interns at the Heritage Foundation ran around the country disbursing cash and the only thing disappearing in Iraq were sackfuls of money.  Whatever else is going on here, some people are getting very wealthy.</p>

                                <p>This post is on spending on civilian physical infrastructure and how its changed by Presidential administration since the early 1950s. Kind of a follow-up to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/mclaughlin-group-on-whether-we-invest.html">PGL&#8217;s post from earlier today</a>, but using data from the White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist09z3.xls">Office of Management and Budget Table 9.3</a>: Given the recent bridge collapse, and the disaster that was New Orleans in the wake of Katrina, I think it makes sense to focus on non-defense related expenditures. The table divides spending into categories: direct federal spending and grants, the latter presumably being to state and local government. Direct federal spending, in turn, is broken out by “defense” and “non-defense.” I assume the vast majority of spending via grants is for non-defense purposes. So I’m going to assume that spending on non-defense Physical capital investment is made up of direct federal spending for non-defense purposes, and spending via grants.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here are three graphs: federal receipts as a percentage of GDP, federal outlays as a percentage of GDP, and surplus or deficit as a percentage of GDP.</p>

<p>Here are summary tables.</p>

<p>What we get from this… spending on infrastructure was pretty piddly when Ike took over. But Ike was impressed by the German autobahn system, and went on to start construction of the freeway system we have today. (Being a notorious commie, Ike was usurping the role of the private sector, who no doubt would have built the freeway system cheaper, better, and faster.) As a percentage of GDP, spending on non-defense infrastructure stayed more or less constant until the Reagan era, when it dropped, and its been more or less constant ever since. (My guess is that its not as constant as the graphs make it look… that’s probably more a function of the lack of granularity of the data in the table.) Clinton did increase spending on infrastructure as a percent of the budget even while <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z3.xls">shrinking the budget as a percent of GDP</a>. GW has done the opposite.</p>
<p>Spending is a matter of priorities. And infrastructure has not been a priority for decades. Which is a pity, because spending on infrastructure is a matter of investing in the future. You can make the finances look very good in the short term by ignoring long term problems (i.e., cutting spending on infrastructure) a la Reagan, but it has long term consequences. The only two administrations to do any appreciable cutting of spending as a percentage of GDP, Ike and Clinton, understood that – hence, they also were the administrations that increased spending the most on non-defense physical infrastructure as a percent of the amount they did spend. </p>
<p>I note also that precedent matters. Ike set a precedent, and it was followed for a while. Reagan set another (lower) precedent, and that&#8217;s been more or less followed ever since. Should we be surprised that bridges collapse given the precedent that is being followed? I don&#8217;t think so. I think our luck may just now start be running out and we have one more price to pay for Reaganomics coming due, and this one may cause more damage than the price we&#8217;re paying (and paid so far) for his runup of the debt.</p>
<p>Next post in the series&#8230; It occurs to me I’ve been remiss and left out an obvious post for this series on Presidents, and I&#8217;ll be correcting that oversight.</p>

                                <p>I’m watching the Republican <a href="http://politicalinsider.com/2007/06/all_candidates_agree_to_iowa_d.html">Iowa Debates</a> and as usual, the only person on the stage that isn’t pandering to the rightwing with serial dishonesty is Ron Paul.  </p>
<p>Rudy Giuliani was asked how he would raise funds to rebuild our aging infrastructure such as our bridges.  His answer was cut tax rates.  He kept repeating that is a “liberal Democratic assumption” that raising tax rates will lead to more revenues. It would seem that <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/03/more-laffer-curve-laughers.html">Andrew Samwick</a> rejects this Laffer curve nonsense.  <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/03/mccain-on-laffer-curve.html">Greg Mankiw</a> generally rejects this nonsense, but his candidate echoed Giuliani’s nonsense.  I wonder if these two clowns think all economists are liberal Democrats?  </p>
<p>OK, you might argue that Lawrence Kudlow and Donald Luskin believe in the Laffer curve but if Rudy Giuliani thinks that these two clowns are economists, he is not qualified to be President.  Then again – most of the folks on this panel are saying the Fair Tax is a great policy proposal.  Oh wait – Brownback just touted his optional flat tax.  What a bunch of IDIOTS.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why <a href="http://www.mclaughlin.com/">John McLaughlin</a> invited CNBC’s Maria Bartiromo to join his gang of pundits.  All she seemed to care about was how the stock market was doing.  When the Group was talking about the economy, she noted that the market had recently declined but the labor market was still soaring.  OK, McLaughlin himself kept talking about how the unemployment rate has held steady but couldn’t someone on the panel noted that the employment to population ratio had slipped from 63.4% as of December to 63.0% in July.  Yep – that old labor force participation rate dipped from 66.4% to 66.1%.  <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/15838253">CNBC</a> touts one of Bartiromo’s shows as a “syndicated business, financial and economic news program” but its host thinks the labor market is soaring?</p>
<p>But to the main topic of this thread will address the Group’s coverage of the Minnesota bridge collapse.  Pat Buchanan started off by complaining that we do not spend as much on transportation as we used to.  That got me curious so I turned to table 3.16 of the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">NIPA</a> tables.  Government spending on transportation is reported from 1959 to 2003 and our graph shows spending relative to GDP.  Now I’m also curious as to why the Bureau of Economic Analysis has not provided data since 2003.  But notice something – we used to invest about 1.2% of GDP on transportation back in the 1960’s and the 1970’s and have invested about 1% of GDP since.  </p>
<p>The host started blaming the Iraq War for diverting resources away from investing in transportation.  Tony Blankley – Newt’s British boy and serial apologist for the Bush Administration – almost had a heart attack over this claim.  Blankley noted that the lack of investment in transportation predated this Administration.  Good thing I wasn’t invited on the show as I would have suggested that the Reagan tendency to cut taxes as we increased defense spending back in the 1980’s may have been a factor here.  Tony certainly would have exploded over the suggestion that tax cuts for the rich may have been responsible for this supposed lack of investment in transportation.</p>
<p>While Buchanan started off strong, he ended with the stupid comment of the show – even more stupid that any of the babbling from Bartiromo. Buchanan had to get in our current account deficit with China somehow so he tried to argue that all those dollars that they are buying has allowed them to invest more in their infrastructure than we do.  Let’s review the accounting that Buchanan got backwards.  Our current account deficit means our investment exceeds our national savings.  China’s current account surplus means their investment is less than their national savings.  But then our national savings is rather low thanks in part due to the fiscal irresponsibility of the Bush Administration.  Again, it’s a good thing that the show did not have anyone on the panel that gets this as I wouldn’t want Tony Blankley to have that heart attack.  But maybe Maria Bartiromo will run a story on how invest in stocks that will benefit from the concern over our bridges.</p>

                                <p>Since it seems to blog about Iraq day here at Angry Bear, let me add my own contribution&#8230; I read <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3440947">this</a> the other day&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Much of the Iraqi capital was without running water Thursday and had been for at least 24 hours, compounding the urban misery in a war zone and the blistering heat at the height of the Baghdad summer. </p>
<p>Residents and city officials said large sections in the west of the capital had been virtually dry for six days because the already strained electricity grid cannot provide sufficient power to run water purification and pumping stations.</p>
<p>Baghdad routinely suffers from periodic water outages, but this one is described by residents as one of the most extended and widespread in recent memory. The problem highlights the larger difficulties in a capital beset by violence, crumbling infrastructure, rampant crime and too little electricity to keep cool in the sweltering weather more than four years after the U.S.-led invasion.</p>
<p>Jamil Hussein, a 52-year-old retired army officer who lives in northeast Baghdad, said his house has been without water for two weeks, except for two hours at night. He says the water that does flow smells and is unclean.</p>
<p>Two of his children have severe diarrhea that the doctor attributed to drinking what tap water was available, even after it was boiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to continue drinking it, because we don&#8217;t have money to buy bottled water,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna pause for a moment and note that this guy has the same name and a similar profession as some dude that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamil_Hussein_controversy">insisted on existing</a> despite reports to the contrary, so I think we can safely say $@&#038;* him and his family, and this story must be false.  Keeping that in mind, we continue on&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Adel al-Ardawi, a spokesman for the Baghdad city government, said that even with sufficient electricity &#8220;it would take 24 hours for the water mains to refill so we can begin pumping to residents. And even then the water won&#8217;t be clean for a time. We just don&#8217;t have the electricity or fuel for our generators to keep the system flowing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noah Miller, spokesman for the U.S. reconstruction program in Baghdad, said that water treatment plants were working &#8220;as far as we know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It could be a host of issues. &#8230; And one of those may be leaky trunk lines. If there&#8217;s not enough pressure to cancel out that leakage, that&#8217;s when the water could fail to reach the household,&#8221; Miller said.</p>
<p>He said that there had been a nationwide power blackout for a few hours Wednesday night that might be causing problems for all systems that depend on Iraq&#8217;s already creaking electricity grid.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think its time to prove that Noah Miller doesn&#8217;t exist&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>In the meantime, Iraqis suffer in brutal heat. It was 117 degrees in the capital Thursday, down from 120 the day before. With the power out or crackling through the decrepit system just a few hours each day, even those who can afford air conditioning do not have the power to run it.</p>
<p>Many Baghdad residents have banded together to use power from neighborhood generators, but the cost of fuel and therefore electricity is skyrocketing. Diesel fuel was going for nearly $4 a gallon on Thursday.</p>
<p>As expected in the midst of a water shortage, the cost of purified bottled water has shot up 33 percent. A 10-liter bottle now costs $1.60.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, we can buy bottled water. But I&#8217;m thinking about the poor who cannot afford to buy clean water,&#8221; said Um Zainab, a 44-year-old homemaker in eastern Baghdad. &#8220;This shows the weakness and the inefficiency of government officials who are good at only one thing blaming each other for the problems we are face.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Um Zainab?  Um Zunaib?  What kind of a silly name is that.  Clearly this woman is as fictional as Australia.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve read enough.  I think its safe to conclude it was a balmy 78 degrees in Baghdad, there was waaaay too much electricity for anyone&#8217;s good, and they opened up the fire hydrants for the kids to play in the streets.  Somewhere, an Iraqi Norman Rockwell is painting.</p>

<p>Thinking about Syria </p>
<p>Syria has a population of about 19 million people.</p>
<p>GDP= about $27 billion</p>
<p>Estimated .5 million  Palestinian refugees and 1.3 million Iraqis=1.8 million refuges=10% of the population of citizens.</p>
<p>It is the only country that currently has an open door policy for refugees. <br />____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The US granted 744 visas, and under pressure President Bush promised 7,000 more, but has made no mention of how, who, and when the visas might be granted.  Currently the US does not provide aid directly to help with the refugee problem.</p>
<p>Do we have any obligation to Iraqi refugees?  </p>
<p>Is it reasonable for an Iraqi refugee to expect US aid?</p>
<p>Is it reasonable for an Iraqi who has been active in supporting the US effort in Iraq (interpreters, aides, businessmen) who must flee because of death threats to expect asylum in the US? </p>
<p>Is it in the US interests to provide aid (hearts and minds?)?</p>
<p>When I consider our track record of Federal help with Katrina refugees, I wonder at Syria&#8217;s capacity to deal with this problem.  Is it in our national interests to keep Iraqi Muslims out of the US, which at least appears to be the policy?</p>
<p>Is it even a problem worth serious consideration in the occupation effort?</p>

                                <p>This one is by CoRev, who objects to my characterization of events of the war in Iraq.  My response will be in comments.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Several weeks ago we had a discussion, maybe in a comments thread, about why it is taking so long to field an effective IA.  In it we  discussed the 3-5 year time frame needed and expected in 2003.  Bill Roggio, <a href="http://billroggio.com/archives/2007/08/iraqi_security_force_3.php">has an interesting article</a> on the current Order of Battle (configuration and  location info) of the IA.  From its author DJ Elliott , buried in the  comments, comes this summary:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Leadership is the biggest problem with expanding IA. All officers in IA above the rank of Major are former members of Saddam&#8217;s army. Those that are able to pass vetting have already done so. Which is why only  Major and below are being offered a chance to rejoin.<br />&#8211; Takes a year to train a 2lt (Plt leader).<br />&#8211; Takes 3+ years experience to train a Cpt (Co cmdr).<br />&#8211; Takes 6+ years experience to train a LTC (Bn cmdr).<br />&#8211; Takes 10+ years experience to train a Col (Bde cmdr).<br />&#8211; Takes 15+ years experience to train a MG (Div cmdr).</p>
<p>We have been building the IA for less than 4 years.</p>
<p>Those are minimums that allow for the accelerated promotions that go  with combat experience. Faster than that is dangerous for all concerned.  Look up the average time in service for a US MG in WWII and you will  find it longer. Experience is not optional for a combat commander&#8230;</p>
<p>E.G.: The Current Commander of 5th IA Div and the Diyala Operational Command was a Staff Brigadier General at the begining of May. Now he is a MG commanding a Div and dual-hatted as commander of all ISF in Diyala (Corps command is a LTG&#8217;s job). We are pushing them up as fast as possible but, there are too few to go around&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Using this as an AB article might foster an interesting discussion.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Here’s the lead from a recent AP <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/31/AR2007073100495.html"> article</a><br />via The Washington Post:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; Shoppers took a break in June, boosting their spending at the slowest pace in nine months as high gasoline prices and fallout from the housing slump made people think twice about buying.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that consumer spending edged up by just 0.1 percent. That marked a pullback from May&#8217;s brisk 0.6 percent rise and was the smallest increase since last September.</p>
<p>That reads as if the June figures were an anomaly. Not so. Here’s the big picture:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/RrPLAUhr7JI/AAAAAAAAABU/suVR_1GHr-Y/s1600-h/ConsumerSpending.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/RrPLAUhr7JI/AAAAAAAAABU/suVR_1GHr-Y/s400/ConsumerSpending.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The overall pace of consumer spending has declined significantly for almost four years, and much more so in the past nine months.</p>
<p>The next paragraph in the same AP article:</p>
<p>However, a more forward-looking report suggested that consumers were in a much better frame of mind in July. Their confidence shot up to a six-year high.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s NBC/WSJ poll tells an entirely different  <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118600572789185278.html?mod=hpp_us_whats_news"> story</a>. (May require subscription.)  For example, over two-thirds of the respondents felt we were either already in a recession or will be within a year. It was a pretty dark poll, not like something that portrays a “better frame of mind.”</p>
<p>Related, here’s an updated chart of the payroll numbers relative to population.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/RrPLjkhr7KI/AAAAAAAAABc/FAB0XV1eqdY/s1600-h/JPT_93m1_07m7.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/RrPLjkhr7KI/AAAAAAAAABc/FAB0XV1eqdY/s400/JPT_93m1_07m7.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here too the trend is down. If we just focus on July and use the 60-year average JCI of 1, we’d expect 190,000 jobs, not 92,000.</p>

<blockquote><p>Americans are hard workers, but not necessarily the most productive workers, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. It has compared America&#8217;s output per worker and output per hour with a clutch of other rich countries. It reckons that the average American worker produced about $90,000 of output in 2006, measured at purchasing-power parity. Only Norwegian workers, some of whom man oil-rigs, did better. But America&#8217;s output per hour worked—just over $50—was less impressive. Employees in France, Belgium and the Netherlands were all able to squeeze more out of an hour of effort. In Norway, workers can churn out about $73-worth of goods and services in that time.</p></blockquote>
<p>So we have higher GDP per capita than the French because we slave away at the office more?  The French produce more goods per hour worked and they have more time to enjoy that glass of wine.</p>

<blockquote><p>August 2, 2007<br />The Honorable George W. Bush<br />The White House<br />Washington, D.C. 20500</p>
<p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>Throughout our history, Congress has played a vital role in holding administrations accountable, protecting our nation and our military through rigorous debate and oversight. We can point to Senator Harry Truman, leading efforts in the Senate, under what would be known as the “Truman Committee”, to investigate war profiteering and military spending under the Roosevelt Administration. Our system of checks and balances is a source of strength, ensuring that the policies of our nation are tested in the fires of the democratic process.</p>
<p>That is why, on May 22, 2007, I wrote to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to request that he provide the appropriate oversight committees in Congress with briefings on contingency plans for the future withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. In that letter, I noted that the “seeds of many problems that continue to plague our troops and mission in Iraq were planted in the failure to adequately plan for the conflict and properly equip our men and women in uniform. Congress must be sure that we are prepared to withdraw our forces without any unnecessary danger.” Withdrawing our forces from Iraq will be difficult and dangerous and we cannot afford to rely on rosy scenarios and hopeful predictions.</p>
<p>Nearly two months after writing to Secretary Gates, I received a response from Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman on behalf of the Secretary. In that letter, the Under Secretary did not address the questions I asked. Instead, Under Secretary Edelman suggested that congressional oversight emboldens our enemies and public debate over Iraq “reinforces enemy propaganda”. In response to the Under Secretary’s absurd charge, I once again contacted Secretary Gates to renew my request for briefings – classified if necessary – and urged the Secretary to reject the political attacks proffered by Under Secretary Edelman.</p>
<p>Secretary Gates issued a conciliatory reply, regretting “that this important discussion went astray” and reaffirming his respect for congressional oversight. The Secretary stated that he would work with me and the Senate Armed Services Committee “to establish a process to keep you apprised of the conceptual thinking, factors, considerations, questions and objectives associated with drawdown planning”. In fact, as a result of my inquiry, a classified Pentagon briefing regarding redeployment planning has been scheduled for Thursday, August 2, 2007 before the Senate Armed Services Committee. I welcome this briefing.</p>
<p>This morning, I attended a classified briefing on redeployment planning to for members of the Senate Armed Services Committee by Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman, and Director for Strategic Plans and Policy Lieutenant General John Sattler. The briefing, arranged by Committee Chairman Carl Levin and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, was well attended by members of both parties. There is a growing desire in Congress around planning for the eventual redeployment of U.S. Forces from Iraq. Indeed, Senators John Warner and Richard Lugar have written legislation that in part requires the Administration to report to Congress on a new military strategy in Iraq. I am writing to encourage you and your administration to let the Congress work with you to plan for all conditions in Iraq including the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces in a manner that safeguards our national security interests and protects our men and women in uniform.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate, however, that Vice President Cheney has disagreed publicly with Secretary Gates, throwing his support behind the statements of Under Secretary Edelman and casting doubt on the true position of your administration. When asked about the letter in an interview on CNN, the Vice President said, “I agreed with the letter Eric Edelman wrote. I thought it was a good letter”. It was a letter that impugned the patriotism of millions of Americans, including a bipartisan majority in the United States Senate, who believe it is long past time to change course in Iraq.</p>
<p>While it is not an uncommon occurrence for Vice President Cheney to offer support for, or participate in, politically motivated attacks against those who have a difference of opinion, it was surprising to see so outrageous a charge – one which has been disavowed by the Secretary of Defense – given credence by the vice president. While I have urged vigorous debate between the executive and legislative branches, I did not expect a public a disagreement within the executive branch alone, especially on a matter as fundamental as the constitutional role of Congress to check and balance the president.</p>
<p>As a Senator and member of the Senate Armed Services committee, there is no matter of greater importance and urgency than the safety of our troops. That is why I am writing to request a clarification on the position of your administration on the importance of Congress in overseeing our nation’s Iraq policy. Congress must hold your administration to the scrutiny which the Constitution demands and, frankly, your record in Iraq has earned.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Hillary Rodham Clinton</p>
<p>Cc: The Honorable Richard B. Cheney, Vice President of the United States of America<br />The Honorable Josh Bolton, White House Chief of Staff<br />The Honorable Stephen Hadley, National Security Advisor Lieutenant General Douglas Lute, Asst. to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor<br />The Honorable Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense<br />The Honorable Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State</p></blockquote>
