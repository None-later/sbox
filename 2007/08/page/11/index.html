                                <p>Should I thank or curse our friend Mark Thoma for emailing me the latest lunacy from <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118671020180093887.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">Donald Luskin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t hike the capital gains tax rate. Don&#8217;t lower it, either. Eliminate the capital gains tax entirely.  How can tax revenues be increased by eliminating a tax? It&#8217;s simple, when the tax in question is on capital gains. Capital itself exerts a multiplier effect that benefits the entire economy. Investment in new plant, equipment, business processes and whole companies creates new and higher paying jobs, and higher levels of economic activity, all of which generate additional tax revenues far in excess of what government would lose by foregoing cap-gains taxes.  This idea has broad theoretical support. Former Clinton Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers has written, &#8220;the elimination of capital income taxation would have very substantial economic effects&#8221; which &#8220;might raise steady-state output by as much as 18%.&#8221; Economist Jack L. Treynor has shown that &#8220;the level of taxation on capital that is &#8216;fairest&#8217; &#8211; i.e., most beneficial &#8211; to labor is zero.&#8221; And Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert E. Lucas, Jr., has concluded, &#8220;neither capital gains nor any of the income from capital should be taxed at all.&#8221; These economists think in terms of very complex models. But the real-world intuition here is quite straightforward … The cost of eliminating the barrier is foregone revenues from that particular tax. But those revenues are small, usually deferred and non-recurring. In their place, government receives large and recurring revenues from corporate taxes, sales taxes, wage taxes and dividend taxes &#8211; all generated by new economic activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, this is rather stupid but we often hear this babble so I should thank Mark for the opportunity to address the claim that if we eliminate taxation on capital income, the direct impact on tax revenues will be small while the supply-side benefits will be large.  Luskin is following an Ann Coulter trick by cherry picking things certain economists may have said and then twisting their meanings.  The first <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh072202.shtml">Daily Howler</a> that I ever read involved Ann Coulter’s tendency to do the same:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Maslin has some fun with this footnote, but gives too much credence to others. “A great deal of research supports Ms. Coulter’s wisecracks,” she writes—apparently not understanding how much of this “research” has simply been made up by Coulter. Do reviewers ever fact-check books? If Maslin had checked the “780 footnotes” she approvingly cites, she might have seen &#8211; and she might have told readers &#8211; how much of this book is just false. </p></blockquote>
<p>I knew exactly what Bob Somerby was saying having endured this sort of behavior from those “economists” that <a href="http://www.house.gov/jec/fiscal/tx-grwth/estattax/estattax.htm">Jim Saxton</a> hires using our taxpayer funding.  </p>
<p>Before I start in on Luskin’s misunderstandings, let me suggest folks take a look at <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=226006">Simulating U.S. Tax Reform</a> written by our friend David Altig along with Alan Auerbach, Laurence Kotlikoff, Kent Smetters, and Jan Walliser.  It is a long paper, but this part of their abstract is all I need for now.</p>
<blockquote><p>This paper uses a new large-scale dynamic simulation model to compare the equity, efficiency, and macroeconomic effects of five alternative to the current U.S. federal income tax &#8230; It predicts major macroeconomic gains (including an 11 percent increase in long-run output) from replacing the federal tax system with a proportional consumption tax. Future middle- and upper-income classes gain from this policy, but initial older generations are hurt by the policy’s implicit capital levy. Poor members of current and future generations also lose.</p></blockquote>
<p>Altig et al. posed a fiscal neutral switch from income taxes to consumption taxes.  While there are a few second order differences, eliminating taxation on capital income and raising employment taxes in a fiscally neutral way would have similar effects.  </p>
<p>Let’s be clear about a few basics.  Altig et al. are using a long-run growth model that assumes full employment, which is similar to the Solow model.  So when Luskin talks about a “multiplier effect” aka the Keynesian aggregate demand model – he is already way off base.  When Lawrence Summers noted an 18 percent steady state effect or Altig et al. noted “an 11 percent increase in long-run output”, the dynamics of the model suggest that the increase in output in the first few years is tiny.  Steady-state effects will be approximated much later in the century.  </p>
<p>But Luskin paints the picture as if output jumps by a double-digit amount very quickly.  This assertion of course is absurd.  But it is key to the free lunch fallacy of the Laffer-Luskin crowd.  They want you to believe we can cut taxes on capital income without raising taxes on employment income.  But if we “give people their money back”, they will consume more and hence save and invest less.  Unless of course we slash government spending.  Ah but the Laffer-Luskin crowd never get around to admitting the need to have fiscal neutrality.  </p>
<p>Folks like Greg Mankiw are not so incredibly stupid.  Greg would admit that the need for fiscal neutrality.  But as Altig et al. model, cuts in taxation for owners of capital must be offset by increases in taxes for the rest of us.  And the rest of us still pay more in taxes under this new regime even during the steady state.  Folks like Greg might be smart enough to realize these distributional consequences but seem to be not so interested. </p>
<p>In the meantime, folks like Luskin babble their free lunch fallacies as they surround themselves with their own incredible ignorance of even basic economics.  And the Wall Street Journal op-ed page is still dumb enough to print this stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I should also note that Altig et al. considered the impact of a </p>
<blockquote><p>progressive variant of the flat tax called the ‘X tax’.</p></blockquote>
<p>AB reader Ian alters us to a recent discussion of a progressive consumption tax by <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=872721">Sabine Jokisch and Laurence J. Kotlikoff</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FairTax offers a potential alternative to this dismal economic future. The FairTax proposes to replace the federal payroll tax, personal income tax, corporate income tax, and estate tax (not modeled here) with a progressive consumption tax delivered in the form of a federal retail sales tax plus a rebate. According to our simulation model, these policy changes would almost double the U.S. capital stock by the end of the century and raise long-run real wages by 19 percent compared to the base case alternative.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that their model also has the output gains only slowly being realized over time.  The authors note that there will be winners and losers, but this FairTax has different distributional implications from the proposal favored by Luskin.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: AB reader 2slug offers up <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w12880">Taxing Capital: Not a Bad Idea After All</a> by Juan C. Conesa, Sagiri Kitao, and Dirk Krueger: </p>
<blockquote><p>In this paper we quantitatively characterize the optimal capital and labor income tax in an overlapping generations model with idiosyncratic, uninsurable income shocks, where households also differ permanently with respect to their ability to generate income. The welfare criterion we employ is ex-ante (before ability is realized) expected (with respect to uninsurable productivity shocks) utility of a newborn in a stationary equilibrium. Embedded in this welfare criterion is a concern of the policy maker for insurance against idiosyncratic shocks and redistribution among agents of different abilities. Such insurance and redistribution can be achieved by progressive labor income taxes or taxation of capital income, or both. The policy maker has then to trade off these concerns against the standard distortions these taxes generate for the labor supply and capital accumulation decision. We find that in our model the optimal capital income tax rate is significantly positive. The optimal (marginal and average) tax rate on capital is 36%, in conjunction with a progressive labor income tax code that is, to a first approximation, a flat tax of 23% with a deduction that corresponds to about $6,000 (relative to an average income of households in the model of $35,000). We argue that the high optimal capital income tax is mainly driven by the life cycle structure of the model whereas the optimal progressivity of the labor income tax is due to the insurance and redistribution role of the income tax system.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>One Salient Oversight sends me a link to a piece he wrote <a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2005/08/perfect-storm-approaches-america.html">two years ago</a>.  I took the liberty of simply stealing most of it:</p>
<blockquote><p>America is about to be hit by a perfect economic storm. It &#8211; and the rest of the world &#8211; will be changed forever by it. The fact that the storm will hit is easier to prove than trying to work out when, but chances are that the wind and the waves are beginning to be felt.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>The first problem is that there is an unsustainable housing price boom in the US. Analysts have been complaining about this for more than a year now. The fact is that the boom in house prices in the US is outstripping any growth in the average wage &#8211; which essentially means that, at some point, the prices will have to fall. The growth in house prices has led to many homeowners to borrow against their equity, and to spend this money either improving their houses or to purchase consumer goods. The growth of US consumer demand since 2001 has essentially been driven by this process. But what happens when housing prices fall? Consumer demand will go into reverse, with people no longer borrowing against their dwindling equity, no longer improving their devalued houses, and no longer spending much. We&#8217;ll see unemployment and maybe even a technical recession. Yet if this were the only problem, then recovery would be easy. But this is a perfect storm, with many different problems converging into one.</p>
<p>The second problem is that the US is running an unsustainable current account deficit. In layman&#8217;s terms, this means that America is spending more money than it earns, and is making up the difference by using a credit card. Essentially it is the goodwill of international investors in propping up the US currency that has allowed the nation to remain so prosperous. Many have criticised these international investors, especially the central banks of China and Japan who keep their own currencies low to allow a trade advantage. While there is a grain of truth in this complaint, the US dollar is nevertheless the ultimate responsibility of America itself. As it stands, the dollar is overvalued, and, apart from money printing to devalue the currency, the only other solution to restore the balance of trade would be for the Federal Reserve Bank to raise interest rates and choke off demand. Given the precarious state of the housing market, such a move would undoubtedly plunge America into recession &#8211; the only difference is that the after-effects of such a recession would be less severe if the Fed were to act now to force a recession, rather than letting the situation run its natural course. If that occurred, the market would eventually turn against the US dollar and harshly devalue it. No country, nor even individual for that matter, can continue to prosper by relying upon borrowed money. Eventually it will have to be paid back. Better sooner than later.</p>
<p>The third problem is that the US government is running an unsustainable budget deficit. It is supremely ironic that the political party that preaches most about about fiscal responsibility &#8211; the Republican party &#8211; is the same party that has presided over some of the most damaging fiscal deficits and overspending in US history. And this goes back to Reagan. Supply side economics, which relies upon the mistaken and never-proven-in-practice idea that lowering tax rates will actually raise the amount of tax revenue, is still popular in political circles, mainly because it relies upon that wonderful political tactic of promising tax cuts and painting their opponents as lovers of taxation. It is a very clever political tactic &#8211; a pity it results in economic hardship. In order to bring the government back into fiscal balance, the US must choose between raising taxes, cutting spending, or a combination of both. No matter what the choice is, the natural result will be economic hardship. Nevertheless, it is better for the pain to be felt now rather than later &#8211; if fiscal irresponsibility continues, the end result will be far worse.</p>
<p>The fourth problem is that the US economy relies heavily upon cheap oil imports to run its economy. The problem with this is not so much geo-political, but geological. A growing chorus of experts has been warning for some time now that there is a natural limit to how much oil can be pumped out of underground reservoirs. Known as Peak Oil, such a situation will not lead to the world running out of oil, but will result in an ever-decreasing supply of oil as the years go by. The result of this will be ever increasing petrol prices, with a commensurate growth in inflationary pressure on other goods and services. The US, more than any other country, relies upon roads, freeways and motor cars for its economy to continue. Europe and Asia, by contrast, have sophisticated and integrated public-transport systems that will become increasingly cost-effective the further oil prices rise. In this area, the US has further to fall than other industrialised nations. Peak Oil is probably already hitting us now &#8211; have you wondered why oil prices are so high? It is because supply cannot keep up with demand.</p>
<p>It is this last point that has got me most concerned &#8211; the first three points together are bad enough, but it is the peaking of oil production that will be the real killer over the long term. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re looking at a recession here &#8211; we&#8217;re looking at a long term economic downturn, maybe the equivalent of an economic depression if some oil experts are to be believed.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure &#8211; while this perfect storm will hit America hard, it will have knock on effects for the rest of the world. We won&#8217;t survive unscathed.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Josh Marshall says this was the alternative headline for <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/016464.php">this post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it&#8217;s a measure of how brain dead the Republicans have become on the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; that their big puffing or policy statements on the issue now most often amount to bizarre and sometimes incomprehensible grammatical reformulations or, failing that, reorderings of sentence structure. So for example, now you have Mitt Romney saying, &#8220;There&#8217;s not a global war on terror. There&#8217;s a global war being waged by the terrorists and if I am president, there will be a global war waged on the terrorists and we will win.&#8221; This comes after Rudy&#8217;s insistence on rebranding the War on Terror as the &#8220;Terrorists&#8217; War on Us.&#8221; &#8230; Their perplexity and paralysis in the face of reality is making them look like one of those alien computers or robots at the end of one of the old Star Trek episodes where Capt. Kirk hits them with too much kick-ass logic and smoke starts to come out of their ears and then they explode.</p></blockquote>
<p>The title of his post was Global War on Verbs.  I find it this not only really funny but also quite telling for a simple reason.  RUDY has adopted the habit of word searching Democratic speeches on Iraq-istan (my term for how insists that the nations of Afghanistand and Iraq are the same issue as if Saddam Hussein equals Osama bin Laden) so that he can point out that we Democrats don’t use exactly the same words the GOP does.  And since we don’t talk like RUDY, we don’t care about battling terrorism.  After all, RUDY thinks we are all “losers” – a term my son used too much when he was three years old but outgrew by this fourth birthday.  Such has become the juvenile campaign of RUDY &#8211; with all due apologies to real children who are generally much smarter than these brain dead Republicans.</p>

<blockquote><p>Whether they knew it or not, a lot of people bet that house prices would go up indefinitely. If they don&#8217;t, a lot of them get screwed. I bet that they would not. If they get screwed, maybe I get a shot at a good deal on a new house. If their bets are covered by government policy, they get to live in a house they couldn&#8217;t really afford, and I stay priced out of some houses. Maybe some of my taxes are used to subsidize others with higher incomes, net worth, and house value.</p></blockquote>

<p>Banking is a necessary part of all but the most primitive economies. We need banking. Banking faces a number of risks that must be mitigated &#8211; eliminated if possible at a reasonable price &#8211; to assure the rest of the economy functions well. </p>
<p>We should not find it odd that bankers insist on letting the market work when the market is to their advantage, and call for help of various kinds when that is to their advantage. Anybody in their right mind would do the same. </p>
<p>However, we do see the odd circumstance that bankers and financiers of various kinds earn better than, well, better than anybody excepting Ms Rowling and some oil execs. This is an industry that is given access to the discount window, surveyed regularly to find out what kind of securities it would like to by from the Treasury, allowed by buy insurance for its depositors from the Federal government, rather than from markets, shored up through monetary policy, and so on. </p>
<p>Now, if this were lending in the old fashioned sense that the saver offers funds to the borrower directly, absorbing much of the risk and providing funds for growth in return for the opportunity to growth rich, it would be one matter. Largely, however, the people who receive those big bank bonuses do so by putting other peoples money at risk. When they succeed, they grow rich beyond the dreams of ancient kings. When they fail, they lose nothing but their job, and can usually find another one that pays straight salary beyond the dreams of landed aristocrats.</p>
<p>It makes sense to take care of banks, but why do we take care of bankers? Why do we not tax bankers&#8217; incomes in a way that reflects their special position? Tax away that part of their income that represents the effects of the coddling that banks receive, the results of monetary and regulatory changes. Then, the only way for a banker to really prosper would be to do a good job.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Just want to let everyone here know of this web site I heard about. It is <a href="http://myelectionchoices.com/">My Election Choices.com. </a> Their opening statement:<br />
<blockquote>Isn&#8217;t your vote for President worth more time than a game of Sudoku?</p></blockquote>
<p>This site helps you learn which candidates most agree with you. The creators of the site have taken statements made by all the presidential candidates and classified them into 18 categories. You then check off the statements you agree with. You are blinded as to which candidate made the statement.</p>
<p>I have done 2 categories that each had 3 pages of statements. When you click Finish, you are taken to a page that has a bar chart showing you the relationship of agreement you have with each candidate. As you complete a category, it adjust your chart to reflect the summation of agreement with each candidate.</p>
<p>I have completed On Taxes, Spending and Fiscal Policy and On Trade and Globalization. Interestingly, so far I have agreement on 8 Clinton statements, 7 Ron Paul, 5 each for Dodd, Hunter, Richardson and Tancredo. It goes down from there with the other candidates to where I have only 1 statement of agreement with Biden and Brownback. I have to say, some of the statements I agreed with I did not expect to have been made by the particular candidate. You are shown in the results who made each statement and the percent of agreement to date of all those who have completed said category.</p>
<p>You can also see what the cumulative is for all those who have completed all the categories based on topic, gender or most popular category. Currently the leading candidate at 27% based on topic is Dodd. At 23% is Kucinich, Hunter, and Huckabee. Clinton is at 11% as is Gravel!</p>
<p>I think this site is just what has been missing in our modern elections. It give one an opportunity to work through all the candidates&#8217; positions while minimizing the prejudice you might have already assigned to a candidate. It is a way of cutting out the coloring that our media adds to our learning about a candidate.</p>
<p>I encourage you to give it a run. But, as they suggest, only pick one or 2 categories to start. You can go back anytime and pick up where you left off. I think you&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised. Enjoy.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://sideshow.me.uk/saug07.htm#08101301">Avedon Carol</a> links to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,,2145873,00.html">this story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tension between British and American commanders in southern Afghanistan erupted into the open yesterday as a senior UK military officer said he had asked the US to withdraw its special forces from a volatile area that was crucial in the battle against the Taliban.</p>
<p>British and Nato defence officials have consistently expressed concern about US tactics, notably air strikes, which kill civilians, sabotaging the battle for &#8220;hearts and minds&#8221; and infuriating Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Unnamed British officers were quoted yesterday as saying the US had caused the lion&#8217;s share of casualties in their area and that after 18 months of heavy fighting since British forces arrived in Helmand they were finally making headway in securing key areas, but were now trying to win back support from people whose lives had been devastated by bombing.</p>
<p>The newspaper estimated the number of civilian casualties this year in Helmand at close to 300 &#8211; most caused by foreign and Afghan forces, not the Taliban. Human rights and aid groups estimate that 230 Afghan civilians were killed throughout the south of the country last year.</p>
<p>Nato officers admit they are troubled by the high toll. One medic told the Guardian that during a 14-day period last month, British soldiers rescued 30 Afghan civilians wounded in bombings or firefights &#8211; half of whom were children.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>British officers say US special forces are cavalier in their approach to the civilian population. The tensions were illustrated by an incident the Guardian witnessed in Sangin earlier this summer.</p>
<p>A British patrol was abandoned by its American special forces escort in the town for several hours. Stranded in central Sangin, British officers tried to establish radio contact with the Americans, who had disappeared without warning, and swore impatiently when they could not.</p>
<p>The British criticisms intensified after the Americans led them to their proposed site for a new Afghan patrol base in the town &#8211; beside a graveyard and a religious shrine. &#8220;Sensitivity is not their strong suit,&#8221; said one British officer.</p>
<p>Most British soldiers work well with regular American troops and some speak admiringly of them. But US special forces units are a different matter.</p>
<p>They operate under a different chain of command, with their own rules on everything from dress code to the use of weapons. Whereas the British troops operate under Nato command, the American special forces are commanded from the US-led coalition in Bagram airbase outside Kabul. That means the Americans can call on a wider range of airstrikes, and also that British officers have little control over which munitions are dropped in populated areas.</p>
<p>The British military spokesman in Helmand, Lt Col Charlie Mayo, said the special forces had supported seven British-led operations in Helmand since last April. He said that relations between the two sides were &#8220;excellent&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;To work together effectively we have to have bloody good cooperation and we have to mutually support each other,&#8221; he said. Col Mayo stressed that the British commander who had a problem with special forces had requested them to leave Sangin town only, not all of Helmand.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Reader Shogg sees the news and ponders a question&#8230;. (I&#8217;ve edited his/her e-mail slightly so it stands alone as a blog post.)</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve heard lot of praise for letting the &#8220;market&#8221; do its thing rather than resort to government regulation. So, we now have a situation where various &#8220;markets&#8221; (subprime, derivatives, structured investment thingies) are experiencing difficulties. It would appear that CDOs that include subprime mortgages were not as good of investments as people initially thought, maybe not Alt As either, and it even appears that the ratings agencies didn&#8217;t do such a hot job of <br />rating (ie.., little evidence to support their ratings). It also appears that there may have been a hefty amount of overleveraging by various entities, sectors, what have you. That&#8217;s just my vagueish description, I am still trying to figure out what an increase in basis points in those relatively new indices (CDX in the US) mean or why it&#8217;s so important. I finally found a good definition of credit swaps yesterday, in the Financial Times (or was it an editorial in Bloomberg News online?).</p>
<p>But the response is not what one would expect if one were a believer in letting the markets work things out (since they do it best, right?) as say, Andrew Mellon did according to new biography of him I read a few months ago).</p>
<p>Instead, Germany helped bailout a lender that had gotten in over its head. Bear Stearns tried to bail out two of its funds and if I recalls, has halted redemptions in another fund. Goldman Sachs has halted redemptions in at least one fund. Then I read that both the Fed and I think it was the ECB are scrambling to inject &#8220;liquidity&#8221; (or more money) into the system by a method I don&#8217;t wholly understand but it appears to be pumping billions more dollars into the system.</p>
<p>My question is: why? If the markets are so great, why are government institutions seeking to manipulate them (in the case of the Fed, I couldn&#8217;t tell if they were doing the manipulation with tax dollars or not)? Why are gov&#8217;ts organizing bailouts of lenders who have made poor investment decisions? As Mellon (and many others) have pointed out, isn&#8217;t that just encouraging stupid/overly risk taking behavior? Even more to the point, isn&#8217;t that messing with the &#8220;normal&#8221; or natural <br />workings of the market?</p>
<p>I guess that&#8217;s my question: what&#8217;s a free market or a market if any time it looks as though things are getting a big too messed up, gov&#8217;ts and central banks leap in and interfere? Effectively protect big banks, etc, from the consequences of their stupidities? Will it be the S &#038; L bailout (125 billion cost to the taxpayers) all over again? If the gov&#8217;t will interfere to bail out, then why can&#8217;t it interfere to stop the idiocies that result in the bailouts? (i.e., why did Greenspan&#8211;allegedly, I guess&#8211;encourage the development of at least two bubbles?).</p>
<p>There seem to be some philosophical and logical inconsistencies at work here. Or that&#8217;s the way it seems to me. I guess another question is: that&#8217;s how it looks to me, but is my vision flawed by ignorance? Failure to understand some essential principles of the &#8220;market&#8221;? What would be the principles or concepts that I&#8217;m unaware of that would make gov&#8217;t/market interplays make sense? (i.e., that the market is getting free play, make things more &#8220;economically&#8221; if not physically more <br />&#8220;efficient&#8221;. Now that I think about it, I&#8217;m not that sure of what markets are supposed to do, let buyers buy, sellers sell, I guess). </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>This post was by reader Shogg.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll throw my two cents in, then open it up for comments&#8230;</p>
<p>Cent 1. There&#8217;s a quote often attributed to Martin Luther King that goes something like this: &#8220;In this country, there is capitalism for the poor and socialism for the rich.&#8221; I think whoever said it, whether MLK or someone else, is right. Capitalism requires being allowed to fail. If my business tanks, nobody will do anything to keep me from failing. The Fed won&#8217;t convene a meeting, there won&#8217;t be a taxpayer bailout, and it will be nobody&#8217;s problem but my own. That sort of thing &#8211; Fed meetings, taxpayer bailouts &#8211; that&#8217;s only for the big dogs. And most of them come out of the process reasonably well. A poor person who declares bankruptcy is screwed. But Donald Trump, apparently, uses bankruptcy as a financial instrument.</p>
<p>Cent 2. <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/209779">Nouriel Roubini</a> has a great post on the current problems.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/08/09/bush.newser.ap/index.html">AP</a> reports that President Bush is opposed to raising gasoline taxes so we can have more bridge inspections:</p>
<blockquote><p>A week after a deadly bridge collapse in Minneapolis, President Bush on Thursday dismissed raising the federal gasoline tax to repair bridges at least until Congress changes how it spends highway money.  &#8220;The way it seems to have worked is that each member on that (Transportation) committee gets to set his or her own priorities first,&#8221; Bush said. &#8220;That&#8217;s not the right way to prioritize the people&#8217;s money. Before we raise taxes, which could affect economic growth, I would strongly urge the Congress to examine how they set priorities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Alice Rivlin would be impressed.  Her counsel to John Kerry during the 2004 Presidential race was spend smarter, not more.  So President Bush is arguing that we should spend more transportation dollars on repairing bridges and less on bridges to nowhere.  I would find this to be a credible argument from a President who had a track record of allocating our Federal dollars where most needed for public policy reasons.  But when President Bush has discussed priorities in the past, it would seem his mantra for spending our Federal monies wisely was more driven by some Karl Rove calculus to maximize GOP votes than to maximize the General Welfare.  But if President Bush has decided to finally adopt the fiscal wisdom of Alice Rivlin, I say: <strong>IT’S ABOUT TIME!</strong></p>

                                <p>I haven&#8217;t had the time to pay attention to recent goings on in the stock market but <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6938072.stm">this</a> just doesn&#8217;t sound good:</p>
<blockquote><p>The declines in the US markets came despite attempts by President George W Bush to calm market fears. </p>
<p>Speaking after a meeting with his top economic advisers, President Bush acknowledged there had been &#8220;disquiet&#8221; on Wall Street over the housing slump. </p>
<p>But President Bush said he believed the markets were set for a &#8220;soft landing&#8221;. </p>
<p>President Bush said he expected the markets to focus increasingly on the underlying health of the global economy and robust US prospects. </p>
<p>&#8220;The underpinnings of our economy are strong,&#8221; he said, adding that second-quarter growth had been strong, while both inflation and unemployment remained low. </p>
<p>&#8220;So the conditions for the marketplace working through these issues are good. My hope is that the market, if it functions normally, will be able to yield a soft landing.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>GW&#8217;s record of predictions (and those of his administration) just hasn&#8217;t been very good. I think of the big ones, the ones that at the time got a lot of play (and have since been mostly forgotten): paying down the debt, smooth sailing in Iraq, improvements in Iraq (versions 1 through 94b and counting), job creation, boosting the economy with tax cuts, etc., and off the top of my head they&#8217;ve been wrong all along. </p>
<p>So two thoughts:<br />1. Can anyone think of an important one he got right? <br />2. I&#8217;m not a religious person, but I suspect its time to start praying that this time, for once, GW is right.</p>
