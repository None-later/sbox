<p>Divorced one like Bush <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/never-thought-ild-make-it-to-aristocrat.html">linked</a> to a woeful tale about a retired major general who could not explain to congress how his company could collect $47 million for delivering nothing of value for a contract to do work for our effort in Iraq.</p>
<p>Some might think it treasonous and not very supportive of the troops to bilk the US government with a terrible terrorist threat, a war going on, the daunting specter of Islamofascists, bin Laden and all.</p>
<p>This retired major general is a true patriot, despite his participation in plundering the US taxpayer and not doing a thing for safeguarding the US.</p>
<p>It is business as usual for the folks taking advantage of the moral hazards of having a huge for profit war machine. </p>
<p>How is it so out of hand? I will attempt to explain in 400 words or less. </p>
<p>There is the federal acquisition regulation (FAR), based on the code of federal regulation (CFR).</p>
<p>In the case of our retired major general we need to go to sub part 16.3/16.301.1 Cost Reimbursement Contracts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cost-reimbursement types of contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. These contracts establish an estimate of total cost for the purpose of obligating funds and establishing a ceiling that the contractor may not exceed (except at its own risk) without the approval of the contracting officer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The important words are &#8220;allowable&#8221; and &#8220;incurred&#8221;.</p>
<p>Allowable costs have nothing to do with any performance. The contractor gets a list of the costs the retired major general can bill the government for. Incurred means the allowable resource like labor hours at a hugely inflated hour rate were spent, in the case in Iraq sitting in bunkers because it is too dangerous to be out doing anything. But the cost is incurred, because they did try to look out of the bunker and see if they could build anything.</p>
<p>No one ever asks if the allowable incurred costs were reasonable.</p>
<p>Playing in the huge scan the government guys just say that cost reimbursement contracts only require the contractor provide &#8220;best effort&#8221;, meaning he hired people and they are getting billed. Best effort is the government guys going along with the con to get good jobs like the major general has.</p>
<p>The government guy who might ask for real work would be blackballed by the retired major general should she/he ever want to get into the retired major general&#8217;s game.</p>
<p>There are &#8216;suggestions&#8217; to use performance based acquisition but performance is hard to describe. And applying such esoteric theory like getting something of value for allowable costs incurred is dangerous in the politically charged revolving door environment. </p>
<p>Your boss may be looking for work with the retired major general.</p>
<p>The root causes are corruption, putting profit and self interest ahead of the public good.</p>
<p>Moral hazard, is there a better example of how a moral hazard unfolds, other than packaging ABCP from sub prime notes?</p>

<blockquote><p>Over the next ten years, which is a bigger hit to the budget deficit: (a) out-of-control entitlement spending or (b) the Bush tax cuts?</p></blockquote>
<p>If you answered (b) – you got it!  But I think Kevin goofed here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Be sure to keep this in mind the next time Paul Samuelson or some likeminded &#8220;centrist&#8221; pundit wails about bipartisan cowardice on entitlement spending but somehow doesn&#8217;t find the time to mention unipartisan lunacy on taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The “pundit” is named Robert and he is no relation to Paul or could be called Robert “not Paul’s brother” Samuelson.  AB readers likely realize I often use this dig when Robert Samuelson gets goofy.  Well – every time I did, I should have sent a royalty check to Max Sawicky as he coined this dig.  Max – we will miss you.</p>

<p>He then links to <a href="http://thumbsnap.com/v/xkq0jLmD.png">this</a>, and goes on&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The link contains the table supporting the figures below:</p>
<p>In the 3rd and successive years of consecutive party rule since since 1961, US Real GDP Per Capita has risen 2.8076% per year on average under Democratic presidents, while it has risen 2.3357% per year on average under Republican presidents.</p>
<p>In three of 20 such years for Republicans, Real GDP per capita &#8220;growth&#8221; was negative, while one of 14 such years for Democrats was negative.</p>
<p>Of three additional years of negative &#8220;growth,&#8221; two occurred in the 2nd year of Republican presidential rule, while one occurred in the first year of Republican presidential rule. Of all years with negative growth, 2001 (the first transitional year from Clinton to Bush) was the least significant.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>This post looks at the evolution in the rate of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) since 1952.  I did have a previous post on STDs a while back in which I had a little fun, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/sexually-transmitted-diseases-time.html">noting</a> that “states that voted for GW show higher average and median incidences of gonorrhea and syphilis, and a higher average incidence of chlamydia, than states that voted against him.”</p>
<p>Data for STDs comes from <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/tables/table1.htm">Centers for Disease Control</a>, and I’m focusing on gonorrhea and syphilis, the two diseases for which data is available going back to 1952.  Note that for syphilis, I am ignoring cases of neurosyphilis” which seems to be fairly rare and only started being reported in 1997.  Thus, syphilis cases reported include primary and second stage, early latent, late latent, and congenital.  Data for gonorrhea includes all reported sufferers.  </p>
<p>Here are graphs…</p>

<p>Gonorrhea seems to have peaked in the mid 1970s, and rates began to inch down under Carter.  The trend accelerated under Reagan, finally coming to a halt a slightly reversing shortly after the 1995 Republican Revolution.  Syphilis rates followed a slightly different path… falling under each President until Ronald Reagan, and then peaking in 1991.  The 1990s saw substantial drops in syphilis cases, and Clinton made it something of a healthcare priority, culminating in the 1999 “National Plan to Eliminate Syphilis”.  Sadly, this plan seems to be on hold, as the decrease in syphilis rates seems to be leveling off and even edging up slightly.</p>
<p>Other than the fact that the Clinton administration put some focus into syphilis, I can only speculate on why the two diseases followed different paths.  I believe gonorrhea is easier to cure, as it responds to common antibiotics, whereas syphilis seems to only be easy to cure in its early stages.  (Anyone who knows anything about this – feel free to jump in and correct my ignorance.)  Thus, in the…  you know what? I don’t have an explanation.  Anyone know what happened?</p>
<p>(Sorry I haven&#8217;t had a chance to provide much explanation&#8230; got up late this morning and have a lot to do today.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Five years into a national economic recovery, the share of Americans living in poverty finally dropped.</p>
<p>The nation&#8217;s poverty rate was 12.3 percent in 2006, down from 12.6 percent a year before, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday. Median household income increased slightly, to $48,200.</p>
<p>The numbers provided some good economic news at a time when financial markets have been rattled by a slumping housing market. But they were tempered by an increase in the number of Americans without health insurance, from 44.8 million in 2005 to 47 million last year.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>The last significant decline in the poverty rate came in 2000, during the Clinton administration, when it went from 11.9 percent to 11.3 percent.</p>
<p>The poverty rate increased every year for the next four years, peaking at 12.7 percent in 2004. It was 12.6 percent in 2005, but Census officials said that change was statistically insignificant.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>The share of Americans without health insurance hit 15.8 percent last year, the highest percentage since 1998. In 2005, 15.3 percent were without insurance.</p>
<p>The annual increase was fueled mainly by a decline in the share of workers covered by employer-provided health insurance, said David Johnson, chief of the Census Bureau&#8217;s Housing and Household Economic Statistics Division.</p>
<p>The income group with the most people losing insurance was households making $75,000 or more a year, showing that the issue is not limited to the poor.</p></blockquote>
<p>For context, I&#8217;ve had a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-poverty-rate.html">post</a> on how the poverty rate has evolved over time. And all I can say is&#8230; there was a good trend going from 1993 to 2000 with poverty &#8211; its a pity it came to an end. Any drop in poverty is a good thing&#8230; and if it comes after 4 years of increases and one of stagnation, its about damn time. Hopefully there will be further decreases in the years ahead, but I don&#8217;t have much faith in this President&#8217;s economy.</p>
<p>As to insurance&#8230; well, for context here&#8217;s my post shown the evolution of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-healthcare-costs.html">healthcare costs</a>. Rapidly rising healthcare costs and decreasing percentages of Americans with insurance under GW is definitely not a good thing.</p>
<p>So to conclude&#8230; at this point in time, many, many Americans seem to be worse off in some important ways than they were when GW took office. (No doubt the same can be said about Iraqis&#8230;)</p>

                                <p>We have a lot of discussion about the moral hazard of Iraq, related to life (the trump card), but I think we need more discussion concerning the policies related to the flow of money because after all, this is an econo blog. Thus, these two articles. The first one: <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/16076312/the_great_iraq_swindle">The Great Iraq Swindle </a>(RollingStone) and the second one: <a href="http://www.indypendent.org/?p=1230">The Mercenary Revolution </a>(The Indypendent).<br /> First, are you an aristocrat?</p>
<p>Both of these are reporting on the extent of privatization that has taken place concerning our security. I&#8217;ll get right to my point of the question: We are paying people dirt to do our dirty work. We have collectively become a nation that insulates it&#8217;s responsibility for all that is a military involved exercise by buying our war making. We just go to War is Us, sign a contract and wah la, we have the fight&#8217;n 9th or 99th or 101 or what ever and no one has to ever worry again about that little question of “did you serve?” Nope, we can now without the risk of harm to our person or our mind bench race our wars. And the race is not about winning the ideologic battle of democracy vs something else. No, it&#8217;s about getting yours.<br />From the first article, The author&#8217;s sums it up:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>It was an invasion of the federal budget, and no occupying force in history has ever been this efficient.<br />In Iraq the lines between essential government services and for-profit enterprises have been blurred to the point of absurdity &#8212; to the point where wounded soldiers have to pay retail prices for fresh underwear, where modern-day chattel are imported from the Third World at slave wages to peel the potatoes we once assigned to grunts in KP, where private companies are guaranteed huge profits no matter how badly they fuck things up.<br />This is the triumphant culmination of two centuries of flawed white-people thinking, a preposterous mix of authoritarian socialism and laissez-faire profit­eering, with all the worst aspects of both ideologies rolled up into one pointless, supremely idiotic military adventure &#8212; American men and women dying by the thousands, so that Karl Marx and Adam Smith can blow each other in a Middle Eastern glory hole.</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re taking about profit­eering at the expense of the commons. It is our budget going to hell. It is our future spent today. It is our children carrying us. To me, it is selfishness to the extreme. It is what I think of with the use of the word aristocrat. That it is done in our name being that we are the government means we are aristocrats in persona.<br />As aristocrats, we are keeping it close to family:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Bush] named Jim O&#8217;Beirne at the relevant evaluation desk in the Department of<br />Defense&#8230;.he sent a twenty-four-year-old who had never worked in finance to<br />manage the reopening of the Iraqi stock exchange, and appointed a recent graduate of an evangelical university for home-schooled kids who had no accounting experience to manage Iraq&#8217;s $13 billion budget. James K. Haveman, who had served as Michigan&#8217;s community-health director under a GOP governor, was put in charge of rehabilitating Iraq&#8217;s health-care system and decided that what this war-ravaged, malnourished, sanitation-deficient country most urgently needed was . . . an anti-smoking campaign.</p></blockquote>
<p>Throughout the article there is the theme of exemption, exception, and favoritism. Are these not the means of play by aristocrats? Referring to the Custer Battles company:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bush administration not only refused to prosecute the pair &#8212; it actually tried to stop a lawsuit filed against the contractors by whistle-blowers hoping to recover the stolen money. The administration argued that Custer Battles could not be found guilty of defrauding the U.S. government because the CPA was not part of the U.S. Government.</p></blockquote>
<p>A judge set aside the jury&#8217;s guilty verdict. Oh the life of an aristocrat.</p>
<p>There is more, read the article. Half way through it is suggested that these activities are a result of a lack of patriotism.  But, aristocrats are very patriotic. One might say super patriotic.  Are we not?</p>
<p>None of this could take place without the removal of the responsibility for the physical execution of a military exercise via privatization of the military. Why do we not see more protesting? Because we are all allowed to be aristocratic in our relationship to this military adventure.  From the second article:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you think the U.S. has only 160,000 troops in Iraq, think again. With almost no congressional oversight and even less public awareness, the Bush administration has more than doubled the size of the U.S. occupation through the use of private war companies. There are now almost 200,000 private “contractors” deployed in Iraq by Washington. This means that U.S. military forces in Iraq are now outsized by a coalition of billing corporations whose actions go largely unmonitored and whose crimes are virtually unpunished.</p>
<p>The single largest U.S. contract for private security in Iraq was a $293 million payment to the British firm Aegis Defence Services, headed by retired British Lt. Col. Tim Spicer, who has been dogged by accusations that he is a mercenary because of his private involvement in African conflicts. The Texas-based DynCorp International has been another big winner, with more than $1 billion in contracts to provide personnel to train Iraqi police forces, while Blackwater USA has won $750 million in State Department contracts alone for “diplomatic security.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re even paying people outside the military to guard our generals!</p>
<p>What is unique about this period of aristocratic war playing is that the aristocrats are not just hiring out the war labor, but are the company them self and thus as is consistent  with aristocratic play, exempt them self and by extension anyone they pay from the hell they create.<br />We are holding no one responsible.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dozens of American soldiers have been court-martialed — 64 on murder-related charges alone — but not a single armed contractor has been prosecuted for a crime against an Iraqi. In some cases, where contractors were alleged to have been involved in crimes or deadly incidents, their companies whisked them out of Iraq to safety.<br />Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a leading member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, which is responsible for reviewing sensitive national security issues, explained the difficulty of monitoring private military companies on the U.S. payroll: “If I want to see a contract, I have to go up to a secret room and look at it, can’t take any notes, can’t take any notes out with me, you know — essentially, I don’t have access to those contracts and even if I did, I couldn’t tell anybody about it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not Bush et al alone. He is only the elected executive with an elected board (congress) representing us in our governance of us. So, as he and they act in an aristocratic style, we are too acting in an aristocratic style. Sounding convoluted? Yes, it is what comes of a means constructed to immune one&#8217;s self from one&#8217;s actions.</p>
<p>The article also discusses the business model for our new privatization of all that is military. It is consistent with what we have discussed concerning globalization. It is referred to as the “branding” of the military, “a hollow company like Nike”. And as would be expected, they are doing it on the cheap by outsourcing the labor. Literally hiring military personal from defunct 3rd world dictatorships.</p>
<p>On so many levels, morally, ethically, what ever you call it, not being responsible for your own actions is wrong. Some may think they are exempt from being labeled an aristocrat because all these aristocratic actions Bush et al are doing are considered to be outside the government by Bush et al. If it were only so easy. Darn government of, for and by the people!</p>
<p>But, let&#8217;s consider what we have created with our aristocratic attitude that is more germane to this blog. From The New Yorker, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/hendrikhertzberg/2007/08/an-opening.htm">Hendrik Hertzberg </a>reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>At a forum on foreign policy, Lorelei Kelly, a former Capitol Hill<br />national-security aide who blogs at Huffington Post and democracyarsenal&#8230;</p>
<p>In that connection, she made another point that was new to me. The military-industrial complex produced by the Cold War &#8230;was and is able to prosper in the absence of actual fighting. The purpose of piling up all those missiles targeted on the Soviet Union, after all, was to avoid using them. But the kind of privatization represented by the gun-toting Iraq war contractors has created what she called “a live war military-industrial complex”—that is, an industry that depends for its profits, even its existence, on hot wars, wars that kill people. “Free-market conservatives have given us this,” she said. “In conversations with military people, it’s an opening to all sorts of other issues.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We created this now multibillion dollar, job creating, money making new addition to our GDP &#8212; how do we now get rid of it when Iraq is done?</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_08_26_archive.html#4120969756016594486">Atrios</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,2023541,00.html">this story</a> from six months ago (February 28, 2007)&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>An elite team of officers advising US commander General David Petraeus in Baghdad has concluded the US has six months to win the war in Iraq &#8211; or face a Vietnam-style collapse in political and public support that could force the military into a hasty retreat. </p>
<p>The officers &#8211; combat veterans who are leading experts in counter-insurgency &#8211; are charged with implementing the &#8220;new way forward&#8221; strategy announced by president George Bush on January 10. The plan includes a controversial &#8220;surge&#8221; of 21,500 additional American troops to establish security in the Iraqi capital and Anbar province. </p>
<p>But the team, known as the &#8220;Baghdad brains trust&#8221; and ensconced in the heavily fortified Green Zone around the US embassy, is struggling to overcome a range of entrenched problems in what has become a race against time, said a former senior administration official familiar with their deliberations. &#8220;They know they are operating under a clock. They know they are going to hear a lot more talk in Washington about &#8216;Plan B&#8217; by the autumn &#8211; meaning withdrawal. They know the next six-month period is their opportunity. And they say it&#8217;s getting harder every day,&#8221; the former official said. </p>
<p>By improving security, the plan&#8217;s short-term aim is to create time and space for the Iraqi government to bring rival Shia, Sunni and Kurd factions together in a process of national reconciliation, us officials say. If that works within the stipulated timeframe, longer-term schemes for rebuilding Iraq under the so-called &#8220;go long&#8221; strategy will be set in motion. But the next six months are make-or-break for both the US military and the Iraqi government.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;There are some promising signs. There is a new overall Iraqi commander in Baghdad. A number of joint operations have just begun. The number of political murders has fallen. Iraqi forces are showing up as promised, admittedly a little bit under strength, and are taking up some of the responsibilities that Maliki said he would,&#8221; the Pentagon official said. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have to be realistic. We&#8217;re not going to stop the suicide bombers and the roadside explosive devices for some time. And the military alone are certainly not going to solve the problem. Maliki has to meet the benchmarks. A civilian surge is needed, too. The Iraqis have to do it themselves.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So if we check off what had to be done by six months from six months ago&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  Gov&#8217;t of national reconciliation&#8230; Um, no.</p>
<p>2.  Improving security&#8230; the Pentagon talks a lot about this, but no numbers are ever provided and the cheerleaders still refuse to walk the streets of Baghdad alone and unescorted.  Conclusion&#8230; this hasn&#8217;t happened either.</p>
<p>3.  Benchmarks&#8230;   heck no. </p>
<p>From this the cheerleaders conclude&#8230; the surge is working, and any attempt to say otherwise is to move the goalposts.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I was thinking about the economy, and what seem like some signs of possible downturn (hopefully things recover smoothly), and it got me to thinking about recessions. So</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a table showing the recessions we&#8217;ve had during that time (dates from the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">NBER</a>):</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtQQxU9FIeI/AAAAAAAAAow/rcmIgzHPOZQ/s1600-h/recessions.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtQQxU9FIeI/AAAAAAAAAow/rcmIgzHPOZQ/s320/recessions.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>By my count, a total of 653 months have elapsed since Ike took office. Rep presidents have been in office for 413 of those months, for a total of 63% of the time.</p>
<p>During the 413 months in which Republicans have held the Presidency, the economy has been in recession for 86 of those months, or about 20.8% of the time. During the 240 months in which the President was a Democrat, the economy has been in recession for 7 months, or about 2.9% of the time. Put another way&#8230; there is almost an order of magnitude difference between the two percentages. So even if some of these recessions were somehow caused by Democrats (and the only two recessions that were truly inherited -i.e., that was in progress when the President elected and when he took office &#8211; was inherited by JFK and Ford (well, Ford wasn&#8217;t elected), and even assuming GW manages not to saddle us with a second recession (a feat not pulled off by any two term Republican President in the sample other than Reagan), there clearly is a difference in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively.html">economic growth rates</a> between the two parties.</p>
<p>Now, some might say&#8230; well, Ike, Nixon and Reagan had very different policies. And so did JFK, Carter and Clinton. How can you bunch these people? Well, the response is simple&#8230; these same people would have no problems grouping, say, the Dear Leader of North Korea, Castro, and Mao, and stating that its no surprise that these three dictators produced disasters. And yet&#8230; the differences between these three dictators are far more pronounced than the differences between Ike, Nixon and Reagan, to say nothing of the differences between JFK, Carter and Clinton. </p>
<p>Whatever the reason, simply put, there is a difference between the economic outcomes of countries that stick the words &#8220;socialist&#8221; in their names, and countries that follow more or less Western policies. And there is a difference between the economic outcomes achieved in the US under Presidents who call themselves Democrats and those who call themselves Republicans.</p>
<p>The question is why? I have my theories&#8230; regular readers have heard them before, over and over. So&#8230; I&#8217;m throwing it open&#8230; what&#8217;s your theory? (Put another way&#8230; why does <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/cactus-first-law.html">cactus first law</a> seem to apply to economic growth as well?)</p>

<p>Moral Hazard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Military madness was killing my country…….” </p>
<p>“Military Madness”, Neil Young, Crosby Stills Nash and Young</p>
<p>Anyone revising history about the outcomes of in Vietnam is encouraging moral hazard; sustaining corrupt, grossly incompetent &#8220;friends&#8221; who cannot survive without support from the US war machine is moral hazard.</p>
<p>George Washington&#8217;s warned us against standing armies and the associated moral hazard of foreign entanglements.</p>
<p>It is like you have a hammer and every thing looks like a nail. Now the US has half the world&#8217;s military and every issue needs to be done with the war machine, lest we lose interest in it.</p>
<p>Hitler, the great exploiter of moral hazard said armies are to be used and so pursued “liebensraum” to huge harm to all, including Germany. </p>
<p>Robert E. Lee surveying the carnage of his victory at Fredricksburg in Dec 1862 saw the moral hazard of war and said its carnage should limit the hazard. He said: “it is well that war is so horrible, else we would love it so”. </p>
<p>Hiding coverage of casualties and the wounded is a way to avoid exposing the moral hazards of the war machine.</p>
<p>The war machine moral hazard people generally think subsidizing health care for poor kids is a moral hazard, the poor would abuse health care resources, but think nothing of subsidizing dictators, corrupt and hugely unpopular regimes with US tax money and American lives.</p>
<p>The US “clients” in Cambodia and Vietnam were crooked and grossly inept. That they took the job of ruining their countries in the first place is an example of moral hazard. American magnanimity to support our “friends” regardless of how corrupt, criminal or inept creates a huge moral hazard.</p>
<p>These &#8220;clients&#8221; are “bailed out” by US soldiers&#8217; lives and taxpayers money. </p>
<p>This is sort of like bailing out hedge funds peddling CDO&#8217;s and worthless ABCP.</p>
<p>The US must view propping dictators as moral hazard and stop it.</p>
