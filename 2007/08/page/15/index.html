                                <p>This post is on spending on the amount spent on welfare and how its changed by Presidential administration since the early 1950s. Welfare is financial assistance provided by the government. The definition is a bit nebulous… I decided to use the following federal outlays (data from White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist11z3.xls">Office of Management and Budget Table 11.3</a>:</p>
<p>1. Unemployment Assistance<br />2. Medical Care<br />3. Assistance to Students (not counting Veterans)<br />4. Housing Assistance<br />5. Public Assistance and Related</p>
<p>This does not include Social Security <br />I left out student assistance to veterans – </p>
<p>Public Assistance and related, in turn, includes:<br />a. Supplemental security income program<br />b. Family support payments to States and TANF<br />c. Low income home energy assistance<br />d. Earned income tax credit<br />e. Legal services<br />f. Payments to States for daycare assistance<br />g. Veterans non-service connected pensions<br />h. Payments to States—Foster Care/Adoption Assist.<br />i. Payment where child credit exceeds tax liability<br />j. Refundable AMT credit<br />k. Other public assistance</p>
<p>I did not include social security and railroad retirement, or federal employees retirement and insurance as these were paid for at least by those receiving the payments. I also left out assistance to student that were veterans – my assumption was that such payment could be construed as service connected. I also left out one-off payments – such as to Japanese American WW2 internees, September 11 survivors, and the like.</p>
<p>Below are two graphs… the first shows welfare as a percent of total <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist03z1.xls">federal outlays</a> and the second shows grants to state and local as a percent of total <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z2.xls">GDP</a>.</p>

<p>So, wattup ma peeps? Well, most people would be surprised to see Carter producing the smallest increase in welfare as a percent of the budget, and Clinton the only President to cut welfare as a percent of GDP. Certainly, most people would be surprised to see them increase welfare spending less than, say, Ronald the Reagan. The big spenders seem to be Nixon/Ford, followed by GHW, followed by (depending on how you measure it) either JFK/LBJ or Ike. </p>
<p>Why the results under Carter and Clinton? In a word, income. Under Clinton <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/real-median-income-by-presidential.html">real median income</a> growth was second fastest in the sample, after JFK/LBJ, and he had the fastest growth rate of real median income <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/this-post-looks-at-disposable-income-by.html">less taxes and the change in real federal debt per capita</a>. Put another way, even taking into account future tax obligations, the median American did better under Clinton and Carter than under other administrations.  That said, the median person is probably not the one Presidents should focus on &#8211; <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-poverty-rate.html">poverty increased a lot under Carter</a>. </p>
<p>(And yes, the Welfare Reform Act probably did help keep welfare expenses down under Clinton, but astute observers might note that the Welfare Reform Act has not been abolished and figures look a bit different now that GW is in office.)</p>
<p>Real median income less taxes and the change in real federal debt per capita doesn&#8217;t explain everything&#8230; JFK/LBJ came in third by that measure, and they came out in the middle of the pack when it comes to welfare. My guess&#8230; War on Poverty&#8230; in fact, some of the welfare payments may in fact be responsible for some of the rise in income under JFK/LBJ.</p>
<p>Among Republicans&#8230; well, the median person did worse under GHW than any other President as did the poverty rate, explaining why GHW spent so much on welfare&#8230; but that doesn&#8217;t explain Nixon/Ford spending more. My guess&#8230; coming so shortly on the heels of JFK/LBJ, Nixon/Ford were likely to continue some of the programs that had begun under the previous administration.</p>
<p>Anyway, I clearly don&#8217;t have the whole story down. Take a crack at it in comments.</p>
<p>Next post in this series&#8230; given the recent bridge collapse, and the whole Katrina debacle, I&#8217;m going to look for data on physical infrastructure investment. Hopefully I&#8217;ll have that early next week.</p>

                                <p>Robert (No Relation to Paul) Samuelson tries to define the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/31/AR2007073101625.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">entitlement problem</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The aging of America is not just a population change or, as a budget problem, an accounting exercise. It involves a profound transformation of the nature of government: Commitments to the older population are slowly overwhelming other public goals; the national government is becoming mainly an income-transfer mechanism from younger workers to older retirees &#8230; These projections are daunting. To keep federal spending stable as a share of the economy would mean eliminating all defense spending and most other domestic programs (for research, homeland security, the environment, etc.). To balance the budget with existing programs at their present economic shares would require, depending on assumptions, tax increases of 30 to 50 percent &#8211; or budget deficits could quadruple. A final possibility: Cut retirement benefits by increasing eligibility ages, being less generous to wealthier retirees or trimming all payments … Over the years, many think tanks have deplored budget deficits and undisciplined federal spending. There have been countless reports on Social Security and Medicare. Most are technical, though some propose major (even radical) changes.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=08&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=samuelson_attacks_social_secur#017456">Dean Baker</a> objects to No Relation to Paul thusly: </p>
<blockquote><p>Those familiar with federal budget projections (which should include economics columnists at the Washington Post) know that the bulk of the projected increase in costs in these programs is due to rising health care costs, not the aging of the population. Those familiar with the debate among presidential candidates (which should include economics columnists at the Washington Post) know that reforming the country&#8217;s health care system has been by far the most important domestic policy issue. But the two programs are usually treated separately, and the larger questions of adjusting to an aging society are mostly evaded.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean is defending what No Relation to Paul referred to with “the two programs are usually treated separately”.  More on this later – but let’s turn the microphone over to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/08/samuelsons-thre.html">Mark Thoma</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Social Security is not the problem, it won&#8217;t take much to get it on solid footing, though the scare stories over the past several years have made many people believe otherwise (and Samuelson has helped to generate this false impression). The problem is not demographics either, though it certainly costs more to serve a larger number of people. The main problem is rising medical costs, and unlike the misplaced emphasis on Social Security in the last election, there is a lot of focus on health care reform in the political debate this time around … Samuelson&#8217;s continual focus on the budget deficit obscures the real problem. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether health care is in the public domain or the private domain, the costs will be daunting either way if they continue on their present trajectory, so finding ways to hold down health care costs is where the focus needs to be. If Samuelson really wants to help, he can quit writing the same misleading and counterproductive column over and over again. Quit saying &#8220;cutting retirement benefits or raising taxes&#8221; are the &#8220;obvious choices&#8221; when it&#8217;s not obvious at all. Cutting retirement benefits or raising taxes will do nothing to reign in health care costs so these measures do not address the main problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this sounds about right, <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/08/thoma_takes_on.html">Arnold Kling</a> felt compelled to write:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why is high spending on medical care a public policy problem at all? If the affluent were spending their own money to purchase health insurance or to pay for medical services out of pocket, I would see no need for government to &#8220;rein in&#8221; such spending. The public policy problem arises because our government allocates health benefits based on age rather than based on need. The public policy challenge is that we have obligated too much in future benefits to retirees relative to our likely ability to collect taxes. In that regard, I think that Samuelson has correctly identified the core issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pardon me for saying this – but Arnold is not really making a point at all here.  Mark already noted that possibility that we could have health care costs be financed either publicly or privately.  The point that both Mark and Dean were making was that we should separate the Social Security and health care discussions.  On the former – the government told us about a quarter of a century ago that we should make large payroll “contributions” so we could build up a Social Security Trust Fund reserve that would help pay for the Social Security benefits of the baby boomers.  Their complaint with No Relation to Paul is that he tries to ignore the 1983 Social Security reform.  So I don’t get how Arnold can argue that No Relation to Paul has correctly identified the core issue.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Arnold Kling replies to our post with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Both Social Security and Medicare rely on the same tax source for meeting obligations to future seniors. Because we allocate more payroll taxes to Social Security than to Medicare, it looks like Social Security will be nearly in balance in 2040, and Medicare won&#8217;t. But if we allocated more payroll taxes to Medicare instead, it would be the other way around.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the same reasoning, I have a solution for the General Fund deficit.  Our income taxes go to fund both Interstate transportation (things like I-5 and I-10 in LA) and the defense department.  Currently, we spend a little on transportation and a lot on stupid ventures desired by the neocon nitwits in the White House.  Now Ron Paul – the only GOP Presidential candidate with a shred of integrity – thinks we should slash defense spending.  If we do that, we could both reduce the General Fund deficit and fix those potholes in the roads I have to drive on.  </p>
<p>But here is why Arnold’s latest – which is a far cry from his attack on Mark – does not cut it.  When we raised payroll contributions in 1983, it was not to fund a Prescription Drug Benefit.  It was to fund those retirement benefits that Dean, Mark, and I talked about.  When President Bush decided to pass a bloated Prescription Drug Benefit, I opposed it simply because he was not raising payroll taxes as he was bragging about some phony income tax cut.  Arnold Kling understands all of this just as well as I do.  But he continues to defend Robert Samuelson’s garbage.  For the life of me – I cannot understand why.</p>

<p>But they also talk about state and local control as being a good thing – the idea is that the more decisions that get made closer to home and farther from Washington, the better those decisions will be.  So this post looks at the share of federal dollars that are provided as grants to state and local governments – in other words, money in the hands of the federal budget that it decides to turn over to state and local control.  Now, this is not something Democrats claim to care about, so one would assume Republicans will score very high at this, and Democrats will score very poorly.</p>
<p>Below are two graphs… the first shows grants to state and local as a percent of total federal outlays and the second shows grants to state and local as a percent of total GDP.  (Data comes from the White House’s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist12z1.xls">Office of Management of Budget Table 12.1</a>.)</p>

<p>Now, maybe its me and all, but I’m just not seeing Ronald the Reagan as being the patron saint of state and local control here.  Ike, yup.  Nixon/Ford… uh huh.  Even Bush the elder seems to fit the mold of how most Republicans see themselves.  But Reagan is the Washington establishment President.  Perhaps its military spending, but then, one can spend on the military through the National Guard.  I note that GW is safely ensconced in Democrat territory (pity its not also true of economic growth rates!), which makes him most similar to Reagan among Republicans in this regard.   Also, if the last few years are any indication, GW’s emulation of Reagan is only increasing.</p>
<p>Next…  I’m still looking for data on welfare… hopefully that’s the next post in the series.</p>

                                <p>I was going to do this post as another Rudy is babbling segment with Rudy’s latest being something about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/01/us/politics/01giuliani.html?ex=1343620800&#038;en=b1cf8ab80a36338e&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">socialist health care</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rudolph W. Giuliani on Tuesday called for transforming the way health care coverage is provided in the United States, advocating a voluntary move from the current employer-based system to one that would grant substantial tax benefits to people who buy their own insurance.  In his speech here, he excoriated Democrats for advocating a “socialist” solution to solving the problem of the nation’s 44.8 million uninsured, saying the party’s candidates encouraged a “nanny government” by proposing a greater government role in health care &#8230; Mr. Giuliani cited horror stories and selective statistics about health care in foreign countries that provide universal coverage. Mr. Giuliani said that a “socialist” model would bankrupt the government.  “That is where Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards are taking you,” he said. “You have got to see the trap. Otherwise we are in for a disaster. We are in for Canadian health care, French health care, British health care.” But Mr. Giuliani’s speech offered very little in the way of specifics. He said his goal was to outline his “vision,” with more details to come in the fall.</p></blockquote>
<p>A bunch of rightwing buzzwords (e.g. socialist and nanny government) but no specifics on his proposal to fix our currently very inefficient health care system.  But boy did he hit a home run with the crack about Canada, France, and the UK.  Oh wait, <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=08&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=senator_edwards_presents_plans#017457">Dean Baker</a> is calling this strike three on Mr. Giuliani:</p>
<blockquote><p>It would have been helpful to readers to point out that by a wide variety of outcome measures, including life expectancy and infant mortality rates, these countries&#8217; health care systems do as well or better than the United States. Mr. Giuliani is either ignorant of the performance of these health care systems or trying to mislead his audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>I call this strike three as we have seen the same kind of stupidity and/or mendacity from Mr. Giuliani on foreign policy and on fiscal policy.  One has to wonder if his policy wonk is <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/should-national-review-nitwits-be.html">Jonah Goldberg</a>.  But speaking of National Review nitwits, let’s check out what <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MWZlODc2NzFhODZlODg0OWE1Yjg3ODI3NWUzYTc4YzE=">Senator Coburn and Regina Herzlinger</a> wrote for them with respect to the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP):</p>
<blockquote><p>The SCHIP battle is not about whether to insure poor children. The debate is about how to insure them: Via the government or private insurers? This debate has not only pitted Democrats against Republicans but has also sundered the Republican coalition. Some Democrats wanted SCHIP expanded by $50 billion dollars so that even families earning about $81,000 a year who have eligible children were included. (The 2005 U.S. median household income was $46,000.) A resolution with the Republicans who hold minority leadership roles led to a compromise, costing only $35 billion, which allowed coverage for those earning up to $60,000.  A fundamental problem with this compromise is that the same amount of coverage for children within SCHIP costs $1,000 more per child than under private insurance &#8230; Senators Richard Burr (R., N.C.), Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) and others want to refigure the tax code so that we could buy health insurance with tax-sheltered money, a right currently reserved solely for our employers. If we purchased our own health insurance with tax-protected funds, we could keep these arrogant behemoths in check, just as we do in the other sectors of the American economy. The Swiss universal-coverage, consumer-driven system requires people, not employers or governments, to buy health insurance. (The poor primarily receive funds to purchase insurance just like everybody else.) This consumer control enables the Swiss to enjoy an excellent quality of care without the social inequality of single-payer countries at costs that are a third lower than ours.  SCHIP is not merely a debate about yet another mystifying government program. It is all about free-market principles versus government mandates. Giving taxpayers the freedom to choose and buy their own health care would unleash powerful market forces that have been subdued by third-party bureaucracies for the last 60 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately for us, the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/80xx/doc8092/05-10-SCHIP.pdf">Congressional Budget Office</a> analyzed this issue a couple of months ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>States have considerable flexibility in designing their eligibility requirements and policies for SCHIP.  In 2006, 26 states set their eligibility thresholds at 200 percent of the federal poverty level, 15 states had thresholds above 200 percent of the poverty level, and 9 had thresholds below.2 (The federal poverty level for a family of three in 2007 is $17,170.) The lowest eligibility threshold in a state was 140 percent of the poverty level and the highest was 350 percent &#8230; Although SCHIP has significantly reduced the number of uninsured children in low-income families, the net effect on the extent of coverage is smaller than the number of children who have been enrolled in public coverage as a result of SCHIP because the increase in public coverage has been partially offset by a reduction in private coverage.</p></blockquote>
<p>200 percent of the poverty level is less than $35,000 not this $81,000 figure used by Senator Coburn.  And it appears that families have the choice as to whether to sign up for SCHIP coverage or not.  Senator Coburn wants us to believe that the government is forcing insurance on people who would prefer to use their rent and food money to purchase private insurance.  But that is not how I read how CBO is describing the program at all.  Now you might think that the GOP proposal to spend $35 billion (per year) is a lot of assistance, but there is something omitted from what Senator Coburn wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>If annual funding for the program continued at $5 billion (the level incorporated in CBO’s baseline spending projections) and current eligibility rules and benefits were unchanged, by 2017, 43 states would have projected spending outstrip available funds by $8.9 billion. With that level of funding, enrollment would fall from 7.4 million in 2007 to 3.5 million in 2017, CBO estimates … CBO estimates, the net additional federal cost to maintain current programs under SCHIP would be $8 billion over the 2007–2012 period and $28 billion over the 2007–2017 period, relative to baseline spending levels. With those additional funds, enrollment (at any time during the year) would grow from the 8.1 million people in 2007 to 8.8 million in 2012 and 9.4 million in 2017</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put, Coburn is talking spending over the decade – not per annum spending.  You know – making the time frame clear is easy to do as well as being critical if you wish to inform your reading.  Then again – this was a National Review piece, which means it was designed to mislead people.  Let’s be clear – the GOP proposal would either reduce real spending per person or make several working poor families with children not longer eligible for SCHIP assistance.  If that is the intention of the GOP – could they at least be honest enough to say so?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The biggest threat to American healthcare may be the nursing shortage, specifically Registered Nurses (RN).</p>
<p>The nursing shortage is unique, I cannot find anyone in the US who disagrees about the nature and extent of the problem.</p>
<p>The shortage is also interesting because despite the agreement on the problem, very little was has been done.</p>
<p>The feds passed a nurse reinvestment act a few years ago (Hillary and Dubya had a love fest) but the total funds were like spitting the in the ocean.</p>
<p>There are many small state and local initiatives, but nothing seems to working.</p>
<p>Besides working with hundreds of nurses, I am married to the world’s greatest nurse, who is now retired at age 55. This is a part of the problem,  the physical beating has taken a toll and her days of pounding the floor are probably over.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Forty years ago women who wanted to work had limited choices; teachers, nurses, secretaries. This guaranteed a steady supply of young nurses, to take the place of those who quit or retired.  How the world has changed.</p>
<p>Now women have all sorts of choices, and men only represent about 4% of nurses (despite numerous outreach programs for a couple of decades).</p>
<p>The average age of nurses is very high, which is a problem. Very few nurses “work the floor” until age 65, which compounds the problem. About 32% of nurses were under the age of 40 in 2004, and only about 60% of licensed RNs  at any given time are working full time.</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>Many Americans need better jobs, so why the shortage?</p>
<p>Nursing requires a skill set many people can not master, and an emotional maturity many people do not have.</p>
<p>The hours are lousy, work includes holidays and weekends, injury rates are high, patients and families can be psycho, physicians can be temperamental and abusive, the pay is ok but not spectacular compared with other professions, and nurses suffer physical and emotional wear-and-tear.</p>
<p>Strategies: Number 1 – create replacements positions</p>
<p>We have LPNs, Medical Assistants, surgical technicians, casting technicians, imaging technicians, cardio technicians, and etc., but we still have a shortage of RNs, because RNs have unique skill sets and everyone else fills other necessary positions.</p>
<p>Strategies: Number 2 – steal nurses from overseas</p>
<p>American hospitals make an organized effort to import nurses. The Philippines actually trains nurses as an export commodity.  Sometimes we steal nurses from Europe and South Africa, and then those country steal nurses from poorer countries. We pass around the shortage.</p>
<p>And the US still has a shortage, and it is getting worse.</p>

<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/too-uninformed-.html">Mark Thoma</a> reads my hometown newpaper – the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-goldberg31jul31,0,5010759.column?coll=la-opinion-rightrail">Los Angeles Times</a> &#8211; so we don’t have to.  Now, I hated to say this as I like the Los Angeles Times, but we are talking about Jonah Goldberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, the point isn&#8217;t to say that the American people are stupid, which is the typical knee-jerk reaction of self- absorbed political junkies. Rather, it&#8217;s that millions of Americans just don&#8217;t care about politics, much the same way that I don&#8217;t care about cricket … Instead of making it easier to vote, maybe we should be making it harder. Why not test people about the basic functions of government?</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark calls this GOP elitism and fires back:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we are going to go this route, why not test for knowledge of the issues too, not just the functions of government?</p></blockquote>
<p>I have only a couple of questions.  One question is why didn’t Mark provide more examples of Jonah Goldberg’s serial stupidity?  OK, so many examples, so little time.  Besides, Mark wanted to point out some stupid statements from other Republicans.  But there is a difference between making an occasional stupid statement versus being a general know-nothing.  But we should give Mark credit for finding a <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=YTVkNGExOTUzZTQ0ZDc1NjAwMmM4MTE2N2QzODllYWM=">real doosie</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economics makes my brain itch. When I was a young policy wonk and had to spend my days deflating constant dollars and reading the Federal budget, I would often give myself paper cuts all over my face just to remind me I was alive. When I was writing for The Street.com I would often wake up in the morning re-enacting the Martin Sheen freak-out scene from Apocalypse Now. Still, I am so baffled by the debate over the surplus that I feel I must wade into those unfriendly waters. For over a year Al Gore has been saying, in one form or another, that Governor Bush endorses a &#8220;huge risky tax scheme that would completely blow the surplus.&#8221; If you search Nexis, you will find dozens of such examples. According to Gore, the Republicans want to &#8220;squander,&#8221; &#8220;give away,&#8221; and &#8220;waste&#8221; the extra dollars in the U.S. Treasury. The media usually let the assumption &#8211; i.e., that having a surplus is inherently a good thing, and not having one is inherently bad &#8211; just fly over the plate. Of course, I have no desire to actually dissect the real numbers being put out there by either side.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s interrupt this August 23, 2000 NRO rant to simply make the point writing three paragraphs saying one does not care about the topic of the op-ed is really bad writing.  But Goldberg does this a lot.  In most of his rants, you have no clue what his point is until you are almost done with the op-ed assuming he even has a point.  So let me try to provide a summary of what he was trying to say in his own words:</p>
<p>The government is not a business &#8230; the surplus is not a &#8220;profit&#8221; &#8230; The government didn&#8217;t earn the surplus (it didn&#8217;t even earn its normal revenues) and is not entitled to blow it on shiny new toys. It&#8217;s your money &#8230; Clinton once said. And he&#8217;s right, alas. But invariably what the government is &#8220;investing&#8221; in are programs that will perpetuate the need for more and higher taxes. They claim to be investing in &#8220;our&#8221; future, when they really mean they are investing in the government&#8217;s future. That&#8217;s why, by the way, they constantly suggest that if you don&#8217;t have a surplus you will have a deficit. This is real &#8220;do not pass go&#8221; thinking. The budget isn&#8217;t a light switch with only two settings. There&#8217;s also this thing called a balanced budget, but that&#8217;s a different story. When Gore and Clinton talk about tax cuts they say cuts will &#8220;cost&#8221; too much. Cost whom? Not you or me; we make money from tax cuts. It wouldn&#8217;t even cost the government anything in terms of things it&#8217;s doing right now, because a surplus is, by definition, extra money. No, the only cost is to government-types, people who want to spend it on new things.</p>
<p>No wonder his brain itches.  Goldberg did not have a clue that governments have a long-run budget constraint.  In fact, he didn’t have a clue about a lot of things back then.  To assist the incredibly ignorant pundit (BTW – he claims to have been a policy wonk at one point in his life, which is really scary), we’ve draw a graph of both the total Federal debt (TFD) relative to GDP and debt held by the public (DHP) relative to GDP.  Before the Kemp-Roth tax “cut”, TFD relative to GDP had managed to fall to 32.6 percent.  But the Reagan era was not one of limited government.  Rather, it was a period of tax deferral with TFD relative to GDP rising to 67.3 percent.  </p>
<p>The reason that President Clinton had the 1993 tax increase passed was not that he wanted a bigger government.  The reason, which anyone remotely familiar with fiscal policy issues knew, was that we wanted to reverse the explosion of the Federal debt relative to GDP.  </p>
<p>Most of us realized in 2000 that the unified surplus was really a Trust Fund surplus, that is, accumulating things like Social Security Trust Fund reserves.  Al Gore talked about this a lot in 2000.  Something about a “lock box”.  How could Mr. Goldberg have missed this?  </p>
<p>Finally, George W. Bush was not talking about a smaller government back in 2000.  He was talking about spending “your money” even as he promised to give it back.  For those really listening to George W. Bush, he was promising to put us back on the fiscal train wreck that we saw during the 1980’s.  And judging from our graph, he delivered on that promise – big time.</p>
<p>But Jonah Goldberg was too stupid to understand this.  Judging from what he’s written over the past seven years, he is still just as stupid.  Which brings me to my main question, which is directed to my hometown newspaper?  Why on earth do you give this idiot an op-ed column?  I guess one could argue that the <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/opinion/24brooks.html&#038;OQ=_rQ3D1Q26hp&#038;OP=202a54b5Q2F)Q5Dwu)FQ3DeQ7BQ7BF)Q25xx6)x6)Q25,)Q7B84p4Q7Bp)Q25,ueQ7BQ7BoQ3DAfF2G">New York Times</a> allows <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/on-the-editoria.html">David Brooks</a> to write nonsense for them.  But as a resident of Los Angeles, is it too much to ask that we not see ourselves as being no better than New York.  Simply because the New York Times makes the mistake of allowing David Brooks to babble on its editorial pages, why on earth would the Los Angeles Times allow a village idiot like Jonah Goldberg to spoil its editorial pages?</p>

                                <p>This post looks at farm subsidies over time.  At least I think it does.  I’m using line 351 of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist03z2.xls">Office of Management of Budget Table 3.2</a>, “Farm income stabilization.”  (I’ve tried finding data on the USDA site – it seems to be designed specifically not to provide data on farm subsidies.  I’ve also e-mailed folks from the USDA with no response – I note that to my recollection, this is the first time I’ve ever e-mailed a government agency and not gotten a response in a week.)  </p>
<p>Here’s a graph of farm income stabilization payments as a percentage of the budget, and another with farm income stabilization payments as a percent of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z2.xls">GDP</a>.</p>

<p>Here are summary tables to match…</p>

<p>(It occurs to me I probably should have left in an additional place after the decimal point on these graphs&#8230;  running too low on time to correct it right now.  Sorry.)</p>
<p>So what do we get out of this?  Well, this particular series is not as, um, trendy (to misapply a word) as other series I’ve looked at so far.  At this point, I should state straight up – I never paid much attention to agricultural issues, so my conjecture is likely to be flawed.  (Hopefully readers will chime in and correct me.)  My guess is that some of the spikes in the graph are related to various incarnations of the Freedom to Farm or similar acts.  The 1996 Freedom to Farm Act seems to be followed (a year later) by an increase in Farm Income payments as a percent of the budget, and two years later by Farm Income payments as a percent of GDP.  I don’t know enough to comment about events during the Reagan admin, though I do recall there was something of a farm crisis and the large payments to farmers were probably related to that.</p>
<p>Note… Republicans (much to my surprise) are not as big into farm subsidies as Dems.  If one runs a means test where the null hypothesis is that the Reps and Dems have the same policies on farm subsidies, that null hypothesis is rejected (P-value of less than .07 for both series).  </p>
<p>The only other thing I can say about farm subsidies comes courtesy of Reader Dan, who sent me a link to this <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07818.pdf">GAO report</a> showing that not only do a lot of farmers get subsidies, but a lot of them continue to (improperly) receive them long after they’re dead. </p>
<p>Anyway, given that I can’t really add anything, I can only hope you got something from the graphs.</p>
