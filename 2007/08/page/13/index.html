<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/opinion/06mcwilliams.html?ex=1187064000&#038;en=56b5d6c45f9d15af&#038;ei=5070&#038;emc=eta1">An interesting article in the NYT</a> on globalization and local food production discusses metrics that are thought provoking:</p>
<blockquote><p>THE term “food miles” — how far food has traveled before you buy it — has entered the enlightened lexicon. Environmental groups, especially in Europe, are pushing for labels that show how far food has traveled to get to the market, and books like Barbara Kingsolver’s “Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life” contemplate the damage wrought by trucking, shipping and flying food from distant parts of the globe. </p>
<p>There are many good reasons for eating local — freshness, purity, taste, community cohesion and preserving open space — but none of these benefits compares to the much-touted claim that eating local reduces fossil fuel consumption. In this respect eating local joins recycling, biking to work and driving a hybrid as a realistic way that we can, as individuals, shrink our carbon footprint and be good stewards of the environment.</p>
<p>On its face, the connection between lowering food miles and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions is a no-brainer. In Iowa, the typical carrot has traveled 1,600 miles from California, a potato 1,200 miles from Idaho and a chuck roast 600 miles from Colorado. Seventy-five percent of the apples sold in New York City come from the West Coast or overseas, the writer Bill McKibben says, even though the state produces far more apples than city residents consume. These examples just scratch the surface of the problem. In light of this market redundancy, the only reasonable reaction, it seems, is to count food miles the way a dieter counts calories. </p>
<p>But is reducing food miles necessarily good for the environment? Researchers at Lincoln University in New Zealand, no doubt responding to Europe’s push for “food miles labeling,” recently published a study challenging the premise that more food miles automatically mean greater fossil fuel consumption. Other scientific studies have undertaken similar investigations. According to this peer-reviewed research, compelling evidence suggests that there is more — or less — to food miles than meets the eye. </p>
<p>It all depends on how you wield the carbon calculator. Instead of measuring a product’s carbon footprint through food miles alone, the Lincoln University scientists expanded their equations to include other energy-consuming aspects of production — what economists call “factor inputs and externalities” — like water use, harvesting techniques, fertilizer outlays, renewable energy applications, means of transportation (and the kind of fuel used), the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed during photosynthesis, disposal of packaging, storage procedures and dozens of other cultivation inputs.</p>
<p>Incorporating these measurements into their assessments, scientists reached surprising conclusions. Most notably, they found that lamb raised on New Zealand’s clover-choked pastures and shipped 11,000 miles by boat to Britain produced 1,520 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per ton while British lamb produced 6,280 pounds of carbon dioxide per ton, in part because poorer British pastures force farmers to use feed. In other words, it is four times more energy-efficient for Londoners to buy lamb imported from the other side of the world than to buy it from a producer in their backyard. Similar figures were found for dairy products and fruit.</p>
<p>These life-cycle measurements are causing environmentalists worldwide to rethink the logic of food miles. New Zealand’s most prominent environmental research organization, Landcare Research-Manaaki Whenua, explains that localism “is not always the most environmentally sound solution if more emissions are generated at other stages of the product life cycle than during transport.” The British government’s 2006 Food Industry Sustainability Strategy similarly seeks to consider the environmental costs “across the life cycle of the produce,” not just in transportation. </p>
<p>Consider the most conspicuous ones: it is impossible for most of the world to feed itself a diverse and healthy diet through exclusively local food production — food will always have to travel; asking people to move to more fertile regions is sensible but alienating and unrealistic; consumers living in developed nations will, for better or worse, always demand choices beyond what the season has to offer. </p>
<p>Given these problems, wouldn’t it make more sense to stop obsessing over food miles and work to strengthen comparative geographical advantages? And what if we did this while streamlining transportation services according to fuel-efficient standards? Shouldn’t we create development incentives for regional nodes of food production that can provide sustainable produce for the less sustainable parts of the nation and the world as a whole? Might it be more logical to conceptualize a hub-and-spoke system of food production and distribution, with the hubs in a food system’s naturally fertile hot spots and the spokes, which travel through the arid zones, connecting them while using hybrid engines and alternative sources of energy? </p>
<p>As concerned consumers and environmentalists, we must be prepared to seriously entertain these questions. We must also be prepared to accept that buying local is not necessarily beneficial for the environment. As much as this claim violates one of our most sacred assumptions, life cycle assessments offer far more valuable measurements to gauge the environmental impact of eating.</p></blockquote>
<p>Agricultural subsidies are grinding the Doha Rounds of GATS to a stop.  Brazil and India are asking the US and EU to reduce subsidies, which the recent passage of the farm subsidy bill is the answer.  However, if globalization is going to happen over time, creative thinking needs to happen.  Of course, power struggles will distort any market, and the GATS agreements contains no provisions for social or environmental costs, but something needs to be developed.</p>

                                <p>Reader CoRev finds confirmation of electricity problems in Iraq from a source acceptable to the right&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>From Michael J. Totten&#8217;s blog we have this interview.  </p>
<blockquote><p>MJT: What do you think about the possibility of Americans  leaving?</p>
<p>Hammer: It is like bad dream. Very bad dream. A nightmare. Worse than  that. Like sending me back to jail. Like they set me free for four years  then sent me back to jail or gave me a death sentence. </p></blockquote>
<p>And then we have this dialog: </p>
<blockquote><p>MJT: What’s it like out there now for the average Iraqi?</p>
<p>Hammer: If you give average Iraqis electricity right now it will be  enough. This is the most important thing. Give them power for seven days  in a row and there will be no fights.</p>
<p>After the US came and Saddam fell they earned 3 dollars a month. Now they earn between 100 and 700 dollars a month.</p>
<p>Giving them electricity would reduce violence. If you don’t believe me, ask yourself what would happen to this Army base if the power was cut off forever and the soldiers had to spend the rest of their lives in Iraq. Do think think these soldiers would still behave normally</p>
<p>Iraqis are paid to set up IEDs. They do it so they can buy gas for their generator and cool off their house or leave the country. Their hands do this, not their minds.</p>
<p>TV is the most interesting thing to Iraqis. They learn everything from the TV. Right now they only have one hour of electricity every day. Do you know what they watch? Al Jazeera. Al Jazeera pushes them to fight. If they got TV the whole day they would watch many things. Their minds would be influenced by something other than terrorist propaganda.</p>
<p>Right now they have no electricity. They have no dreams. Nothing. And Saddam messed with their minds. For more than 30 years he poisoned their minds.</p>
<p>You can’t understand Iraq because you can’t get inside their mind. When you get inside their mind…it is a crazy mind.</p>
<p>MJT: Why is Iraq such a mess? Is it the Americans’ fault?</p>
<p>Hammer: No. You can’t blame it on the Americans. Iraqis are number one at fault for this mess. They are greedy and will do anything for money. They are like people who were in jail for 30 years, were suddenly set free, were given money, then had their money taken away. What will they do next? They will kill for money. They are selfish.</p>
<p>They got selfish from Saddam. Iraqi people used to be different. I am the same person I always was, but most Iraqi people are different now.  They feel that no one will help them so they help themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Go on over the <a href="http://michaeltotten.com/">Mike&#8217;s place</a> and read his dispatches.  Some are enlightening.</p>

                                <p>Hoisted from comments, this from Chrisb:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Yeah, yeah, the system&#8217;s stuffed, but that&#8217;s a problem for you yanks. What I as an Australian want to ask you, as economists, is how America can have a competitive economy under these constraints. You have approximately 1% of the population in gaol and another 1% looking after them, 2% of the population in the prison system where most other nations have at the outside 1%; that&#8217;s pure loss. You have a military that&#8217;s between .6% and 1.2% of the population, depending on how you count reserves, and that&#8217;s what, 2-3% of GNP? in any case, vastly higher than any other developed country. In other words, between the correctional system and the military you&#8217;re taking about 5% of GNP and pissing it up against the wall, compared to 2% everywhere else. And you&#8217;re still surviving and under some measures almost thriving. Is the US economic system really 3% better than anywhere else, allowing you to compete on a more or less even footing? I&#8217;ve never seen an economist address the point, and it&#8217;s driving me crazy.</p></blockquote>
<p>My comments&#8230;<br />1. Why do people continue to bring up this fictional &#8220;Australia&#8221;?<br />2. I suspect this 3% we&#8217;re pissing away is partly made up, or more likely completely made up and then some, but the fact that the dollar is still the world&#8217;s defacto currency. A lot of dollars get printed by the Fed &#8211; which means given to the Treasury (in exchange for bonds) for the Federal government to spend &#8211; which after a bit of time end up in pallets in the home of a Columbian drug lord or in a plastic bag 2 feet below the ground outside the home of Bhuttanese yak herder. By virtue of being taken out of circulation after it gets spent by the Federal government, that dollar can be spent without contributing to inflation, allowing for more monetary stimulus at very very low cost. And the demand for that dollar by Colmbian drug lords and Bhuttanese yak herders, to say nothing of the Central Banks all over the world, keeps the interest (i.e., rent on that dollar) low&#8230; allowing for more fiscal stimulus at very very low cost. Lots of stimulus with no associated pain means lots of growth.<br />3. Its possible the big military is part of the reason the dollar is still the world&#8217;s de facto currency.<br />4. No currency stays the world&#8217;s de facto currency forever. A hundred years ago, the pound sterling is where the dollar is now. And it wasn&#8217;t pretty for a long time in England when the pound sterling got pushed off its perch.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d bet large sums of money that Giuliani himself doesn&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s merely a &#8220;liberal Democratic assumption that if you raise taxes, you raise more money,&#8221; but like with his health care plan, is just adopting positions for their utility in attacking Democrats, rather than their integrity as policy plans.  This is only a viable approach for him because he&#8217;s smartly manipulating two dynamics. The first is that the press won&#8217;t call him on it. Read Matt&#8217;s round-up of the uncritical stenography accorded to Giuliani&#8217;s comments. If every time Giuliani uttered this bit of economic absurdity, the reporter appended a comment explaining that most economists consider this a laughable bit of hackish quackery, he&#8217;d stop saying it &#8230; Giuliani&#8217;s second enabler is the cowardice of his fellow candidates. These comments on the Laffer curve came at a GOP presidential debate. Anyone on the stage could&#8217;ve smacked him down. And one of the most visible of the participants, Mitt Romney, has hired Gregory Mankiw as one of his two primary economic advisors. That would be the same Gregory Mankiw who responded to pro-Laffer curve comments by McCain with a weary &#8220;unfortunately, fealty to the most extreme supply-side views is de rigeur in some segments of the Republican party.&#8221; But his candidate, who surely knows better or Mankiw isn&#8217;t doing his job, said nothing to contradict Giuliani. Not a word. One wonders why Professor Mankiw is lending his credibility to an individual so willing to abet the propagation of &#8220;extreme&#8221; views.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have only one qualification with respect to what Ezra said.  Remember, I actually watched this display of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/does-rudy-giuliani-think-andrew-samwick.html">fiscal dishonesty</a> live on Sunday morning.  Mitt Romney said he agreed with Rudy’s Laffer nonsense.  I have Mitt Romney make this free lunch supply-side claim several times.  I have yet to see Greg Mankiw call Mr. Romney on this dishonesty.  Greg?</p>

                                <p>As a follow-up to my post on lost weapons in Iraq the other day, I note that I&#8217;ve seen a bunch of people link to a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/05/AR2007080501299.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post</a> story:</p>
<blockquote><p>The United States has spent $19.2 billion trying to develop Iraqi security forces since 2003, the GAO said, including at least $2.8 billion to buy and deliver equipment. But the GAO said weapons distribution was haphazard and rushed and failed to follow established procedures, particularly from 2004 to 2005, when security training was led by <em><strong>Gen. David H. Petraeus</strong></em>, who now commands all U.S. forces in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Bolding and italicizing mine.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Iraqi security forces were virtually nonexistent in early 2004, and in June of that year Petraeus was brought in to build them up. No central record of distributed equipment was kept for a year and a half, until December 2005, and even now the records are on a spreadsheet that requires three computer screens lined up side by side to view a single row, Christoff said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I noted a while back there were reasons to question whether Petraeus really is the best the US military has to offer&#8230; after all, he was in charge of training Iraqi security forces, and it seems perhaps the biggest problem in Iraq is the non-performance of Iraqi security forces. (On the plus side, those of them that are double dipping so to speak don&#8217;t perform that well when they take off their uniforms and take potshots at US soldiers either.) </p>
<p>But the Washington Post raises another issue. As Omar Bradley noted, &#8220;The amateur talks about strategy. The professional talks about logistics.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s this very, very scary paragraph&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p>The GAO is studying the financing and weapons sources of insurgent groups, but that report will not be made public. &#8220;All of that information is classified,&#8221; said Joseph A. Christoff, the GAO&#8217;s director of international affairs and trade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why would something like this be classified &#8211; don&#8217;t the insurgents know where their weapons are coming from? My belief &#8211; the Saudis are financing the insurgency.</p>

                                <p>From an article in the <a href="http://bostonreview.net/BR32.4/loury.html">Boston Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a 2005 report of the International Centre for Prison Studies in London, the United States—with five percent of the world’s population—houses 25 percent of the world’s inmates. Our incarceration rate (714 per 100,000 residents) is almost 40 percent greater than those of our nearest competitors (the Bahamas, Belarus, and Russia). Other industrial democracies, even those with significant crime problems of their own, are much less punitive: our incarceration rate is 6.2 times that of Canada, 7.8 times that of France, and 12.3 times that of Japan. We have a corrections sector that employs more Americans than the combined work forces of General Motors, Ford, and Wal-Mart, the three largest corporate employers in the country, and we are spending some $200 billion annually on law enforcement and corrections at all levels of government, a fourfold increase (in constant dollars) over the past quarter century. </p>
<p>Never before has a supposedly free country denied basic liberty to so many of its citizens. In December 2006, some 2.25 million persons were being held in the nearly 5,000 prisons and jails that are scattered across America’s urban and rural landscapes. One third of inmates in state prisons are violent criminals, convicted of homicide, rape, or robbery. But the other two thirds consist mainly of property and drug offenders. Inmates are disproportionately drawn from the most disadvantaged parts of society. On average, state inmates have fewer than 11 years of schooling. They are also vastly disproportionately black and brown.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>An interesting case in point is New York City. Analyzing arrests by residential neighborhood and police precinct, the criminologist Jeffrey Fagan and his colleagues Valerie West and Jan Holland found that incarceration was highest in the city’s poorest neighborhoods, though these were often not the neighborhoods in which crime rates were the highest. Moreover, they discovered a perverse effect of incarceration on crime: higher incarceration in a given neighborhood in one year seemed to predict higher crime rates in that same neighborhood one year later. This growth and persistence of incarceration over time, the authors concluded, was due primarily to the drug enforcement practices of police and to sentencing laws that require imprisonment for repeat felons. Police scrutiny was more intensive and less forgiving in high-incarceration neighborhoods, and parolees returning to such neighborhoods were more closely monitored. Thus, discretionary and spatially discriminatory police behavior led to a high and increasing rate of repeat prison admissions in the designated neighborhoods, even as crime rates fell. </p>
<p>Fagan, West, and Holland explain the effects of spatially concentrated urban anti-drug-law enforcement in the contemporary American metropolis. Buyers may come from any neighborhood and any social stratum. But the sellers—at least the ones who can be readily found hawking their wares on street corners and in public vestibules—come predominantly from the poorest, most non-white parts of the city. The police, with arrest quotas to meet, know precisely where to find them. The researchers conclude: </p>
<blockquote><p>Incarceration begets more incarceration, and incarceration also begets more crime, which in turn invites more aggressive enforcement, which then re-supplies incarceration . . . three mechanisms . . . contribute to and reinforce incarceration in neighborhoods: the declining economic fortunes of former inmates and the effects on neighborhoods where they tend to reside, resource and relationship strains on families of prisoners that weaken the family’s ability to supervise children, and voter disenfranchisement that weakens the political economy of neighborhoods.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Its an interesting article.  If you have the interest and the time, its worth a read.</p>

<p>Memo to the press – your incompetence during the 2000 and 2004 elections were directly responsible for the election of Bush-Cheney and their reelection.  This nation deserves a LOT better.</p>

                                <p>This post is one I should have written a long time ago… it looks at revenues, outlays, and deficits (or surpluses) over time since the early 1930s, breaking things out by Presidential administration. All data for this comes from White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z3.xls">Office of Management and Budget Table 1.3</a>.</p>
<p>I note… I have already looked at taxes, kinda… I had a post looking at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-tax-cutting.html">non-SS taxes less increase in tax obligation</a> by President, the idea being that SS has a separate revenue stream, and that increases in the national debt must eventually be paid and hence represent “deferred taxes.” In this post, I’m going for the classical definition of federal revenues… including everything, and ignoring the future debt obligations.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here are three graphs: federal receipts as a percentage of GDP, federal outlays as a percentage of GDP, and surplus or deficit as a percentage of GDP.</p>

Given in some administrations, the surplus becomes a deficit, and in others, the opposite is true (i.e., figure go from positive to negative or vice versa), the concept of an annualized change doesn’t work mathematically. As a result, the summary table for the surplus shows the percentage change over the entire period divided by the number of years.</p>
<p>So what do we learn?</p>
<p>1. Revenues always drop when Reps are in office, and under every single Republican administration, revenues dropped by more than they did under JFK/LBJ, the only Dem administration under which revenues dropped. Even Reps that didn’t “cut taxes” see drops in revenues as a percent of GDP. (GHW is the classic example.) What gives? Well, as I noted before, there are many ways to cut taxes, and announcing a tax cut is only one of many. One can simply cut enforcement at the IRS and achieve the same results. <br />2. Actual declared tax cuts by Reps are easy to spot. After an actual declared tax cut, tax revenues fall off a cliff in Republican administrations.. spotting the tax cuts under Reagan and GW is child’s play. One interesting thing… the entire drop in revenue is not permanent after such tax cuts… there was a bit of increased growth in the economy, eventually. Not enough to result in growth rates like those of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">JFK/LBJ or Clinton</a>, but growth rate nevertheless.<br />3. People often attribute all that is good in the Clinton admin to the Republican Revolution. Well, let’s see… Reps took over Congress in 1995… what changed? The pattern of tax revenues? Um, no. The spending pattern? Not that either. The combination of the two? Well, that didn’t change either. And what changed from 2000 to 2001, when the Republicans still ran Congress, but Clinton left office? Hmmm… well, tax receipts, spending, and the direction of the surplus all changed. So to conclude that the Rep Congress was responsible for what happened in the Clinton admin, one has to conclude that it started having an effect from 1992 to 1993, and ceased having an effect from 2000 to 2001 and was unrelated to the fact that them&#8217;s the years that by random coinkidink bracket the Clinton administration. Not that pointing this out would make a whit of difference to those who know the truth because they don&#8217;t believe in data anyway. I believe the correct response, to one who knows the truth, is: &#8220;Woohoo, Reagan rocks!!!!!&#8221; or some such thing.<br />4. Does Congress have an effect elsewhere? I am no historian, but I believe the following table is accurate when it comes to showing the dates when each party held control of the Senate and the House since 1953.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RrfIekPDH-I/AAAAAAAAAig/oqRmwu8d-RU/s1600-h/surplus+deficit+table+4.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RrfIekPDH-I/AAAAAAAAAig/oqRmwu8d-RU/s320/surplus+deficit+table+4.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>In 1955, Dems took control of Congress. There does seem to be a big change in revenues – I’m not sure I can explain it. What about 1981 – well, its hard to attribute changes that year to Congress given the new President, Reagan. But in 1987, we do spot… a big rise in revenues, and a big drop in spending, resulting in a big drop in the deficit. We’ve been over 1995 already. <br />5. What about spending? Well, it really doesn’t seem like most Presidents were tight with the money. Clinton cut spending substantially, Ike by half as much, and Reagan by a quarter of Ike’s rate. But otherwise, the pattern has been to spend and spend and spend. No doubt its Bush Derangement Syndrome to point this out, but GW is currently in 7th, just ahead of JFK/LBJ.<br />6. Putting it all together… the most fiscally responsible President, by far, was Clinton – he improved the country’s books by 7X what Carter did, who in turn did twice as well as Ike. The rest of the Presidents made the debt situation worse, not better.  And bringing up the rear are the Bush boys, with GW being off some distance from the rest. Of course, it’s not really a problem… its merely a sign of my acute and no doubt terminal Bush Derangement Syndrome that I would notice something like this because as we all know, Bush is the bestest President ever.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update&#8230;  I just noticed, there&#8217;s a small mistake in the last graph&#8230;  From 2001 to 2003, control of the Senate changed hands a few times, and was deadlocked for a while.  That should be characterized as mixed control.  Apologies.</p>

<blockquote><p>A retired Swiss Army colonel is petitioning the defence ministry to keep the famous pocket knife issued to the Alpine nation&#8217;s soldiers following reports that the next batch of 65,000 could be made in China. </p>
<p>Alois Kessler, a lawyer who served as a reserve officer until 2004, began his campaign after hearing that World Trade Organization rules may mean the government has to consider bids from anywhere in the world. </p>
<p>&#8220;A Swiss Army knife with a Swiss cross on it, and &#8216;Made in China&#8217; on the back, won&#8217;t be accepted at all well,&#8221; Kessler said Thursday. </p>
<p>&#8220;I have real doubts that China would manage the same standards of quality&#8221; as the Swiss product, he said. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Kessler said he is trying to convince the Army that the knife would qualify for an exemption to the WTO rule banning discrimination against foreign bidders. Alternatively, he argued the government is free to set quality and environmental criteria that non-Swiss bidders are unlikely to meet.</p>
<p>Kessler is also trying to appeal through the intellectual property rights that the use of the name Swiss Army Knife carries special meaning, and that any knife from China should be called something like the China Army Knife.  Like gambling law in the US, sometimes these commonly shared products catch our notice and tug at the heart as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is this world coming to when McGiver would have to whip out his China Army Knife to save the day!!!  (The kids need to ask someone if they do not know who  McGiver was.)  </p>
