                                <p><a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/a_bridge_too_far_gone.html">Thomas Sowell</a> starts off by arguing that politicians have more incentives to build new bridges than to maintain the existing ones.  Perhaps – but his proposed solution leaves me breathless:</p>
<blockquote><p>A company that has to get the money to build and maintain bridges or other infrastructure through the voluntary actions of people in the financial markets, instead of being able to extract money from the taxpayers, is going to find financiers a lot more finicky about what is being done with their money.  People who are putting their own money on the line are going to want to have their own experts taking a look under the bridges they finance, to see where there are rust, cracks or crumbling supports.  When people know that the lawsuits that are sure to follow after a bridge collapses are going to drain millions of dollars of their own money &#8211; not the taxpayers&#8217; money &#8211; that keeps the mind focussed.  Those who like to think of the government as the public interest personified may be horrified at the idea of turning a governmental function over to private enterprise.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Thomas Sowell has never heard of bankruptcy protection.  Or maybe he does not realize that some of the companies who are buying up the assets of local governments are foreign entities.  Does he really believe that it is this easy to use the court system to recover damages?  I see an enormous market failure here, but I guess Thomas Sowell is like <a href="http://www.toontracker.com/magoo/magoo.htm">Mister Magoo</a> when it comes to market failures.</p>

Hilsenrath gives a history of How Credit Got So Easy. Brad Delong comments and displays part of the <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/08/how-credit-got-.html">article</a>.</p>
<p>This in the third paragraph stopped me:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks pushed the economy into recession in 2001&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>That of course is incorrect.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/"> NBER</a> dates the recession from Mar01 to Nov01.</p>
<p>This  <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RL31617.pdf"> report</a> to congress concludes:</p>
<p>&#8220;Notwithstanding their dire costs in human life, the direct effects of the attacks were too small and too geographically concentrated to make a significant dent in the nation’s economic output. September 11 did not trip a fragile economy into recession.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking at the BLS payroll data relative to population shows 9/11 at the bottom of the employment downturn, so that it was actually coincident with what sparse employment recovery our country has realized.</p>

                                <p>Excerpts from an e-newsletter of the Healthcare Financial Management Association [(c) 2007]. I thought this was interesting, from someone who knows the innards of the system</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This was the primary discussion lead by keynote speaker, Nicholas Wolter, MD, CEO, Billings Clinic, Montana, at HFMA&#8217;s CFO Summit sponsored by Cerner Corporation.</p>
</p>
<p>According to Dr. Wolter, &#8220;There are very few of us who are investing in mental health, geriatrics, and chronic care management. Instead, we are investing in those few services that produce most of the profit &#8211; new cancer centers, new cardiac hospitals, new orthopedic facilities. Likewise, we are seeing more and more physicians choosing higher-income specialties instead of family practice and internal medicine, and becoming direct competitors of hospitals.&#8221; </p>
</p>
<p>He continued his concern saying, &#8220;Can we continue down this path where distorted reimbursement structures are leading us? Or is there a way to align the interests of hospitals and physicians that will better serve both groups – and the consumers they are committed to care for?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p face="times new roman">Dr. Wolter was not posing a rhetorical question with these words but was looking for practical answers from the roomful of senior financial executives gathered at the day and a half summit. Given the rather candid audience, he heard some surprising answers &#8211; along with a lot of caveats and concerns on the topic from the group.</p>

                                <p>And I just nominated <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/rudy-tries-to-take-credit-for-clinton.html">Rudy</a> for Stupidest Man Alive?!  Sorry Rudy but <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzVmMjZkMWM2ZGQ5MTk1N2ZlZDc2NjZmYWYzMWVhZjE=">Michael Darda</a> has stolen the race:</p>
<blockquote><p>Seventy-seven years ago, members of Congress erected a tariff wall aimed at protecting American business concerns. The result was a stock market crash followed by drastic retaliatory tariffs and a shutdown of the global trading system.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tariffs passed in 1930 caused the 1929 stock market crash?  But the real point of Darda’s latest National Review rant is to argue that there is never a good time to raise tax rates.  After all, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts have led to the greatest economy ever:</p>
<blockquote><p>In fact, low-end (non-supervisory) real wages have grown at about twice the pace for this cycle compared to the first 23 quarters of the last expansion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh?  This real wage was the same level as of June 2007 as it was in December 2002.  Yes – zero growth is amazing growth.  But hey – what else would you expect from the National Review?  Of course, I can only suggest candidates for this contest as Brad DeLong owns the trademark.</p>

                                <p>Via a somewhat righty site, <a href="http://betsyspage.blogspot.com/2007/08/why-pessimism-on-economy.html">Betsy&#8217;s Page</a>, two links to economic stories&#8230;</p>
<p>First, <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110010446">this</a> at the Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, the most recent Wall Street Journal economic forecasting survey, from July, shows that 49 out of 60 forecasters expect real GDP to grow at an average annual rate of 2%, or faster, in 2007. Of the remaining 11 forecasters, only two expect growth of less than 1%, and only one expects a recession. For 2008, the forecasters are even more optimistic, with none expecting recession.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Despite this, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken in late July found that 68% of Americans thought that the economy either was in recession already, or would experience a recession sometime during the next 12 months. Interestingly, this is not much of a change from the past. This same survey question has been polled at least five times since September 2002. Each time a robust majority of between 65% and 85% of respondents thought a recession either was under way or would occur within the year. Americans have been bearish on the economy for quite some time.</p>
<p>In short, over the past five years, forecasting economists from academia, consulting shops, financial services and industry have a perfect 5-0 record against a random sample of American citizens. It&#8217;s important to understand that economists are not always right. Some even say that economists were put on earth to make weathermen look good.</p>
<p>In fact, some suggest that the experts don&#8217;t know what they are talking about. They say that economists make the mistake of looking at aggregate data, for GDP or overall income, which hides serious dislocations for the middle class and those with lower incomes. Those who argue this point believe that unfair foreign competition and unfair distribution of income are leaving many Americans behind.</p>
<p>But this is hard to believe. The economy moderated last year, but the unemployment rate is still just 4.6%, almost a full percentage point below its 20-year average of 5.5%. Since the jobless rate first fell below 5% in December 2005, average hourly earnings have expanded at a 4.1% annualized rate&#8211;as good as any year during the late 1990s. And recent research shows that incomes for the bottom fifth of wage earners have risen faster in the past few decades than incomes at the top, hard work is being rewarded more by performance pay, and income volatility is no worse today than it was in the 1980s and 1990s.</p></blockquote>
<p>The telling line is this:  <em><strong>incomes for the bottom fifth of wage earners have risen faster in the past few decades</strong></em>.</p>
<p>People feel good or bad about what&#8217;s going on right now.  Sadly, the Census data on real median income only goes through 2005, but one glance tells you<a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p07ar.html">the problem</a>:  no matter how much crowing this guy does about real growth (and we&#8217;ll get to that issue in a sec folks), real median income in 2005 was down from the year 2000.  So for some reason, in this administration, economic growth has translated to less, not more income, for at least 50% of the population.  (By contrast, it rose 7 out of 8 years from 1992 to 2000, and the annualized growth rate over that time was 2.3%.)</p>
<p>And then we get a link to an abstract of a paper by <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=588453">Kevin Hassett and John Lott</a> of AEI:</p>
<blockquote><p>Accusations of political bias in the media are often made by members of both political parties, yet there have been few systematic studies of such bias to date. This paper develops an econometric technique to test for political bias in news reports that controls for the underlying character of the news reported. Our results suggest that American newspapers tend to give more positive news coverage to the same economic news when Democrats are in the Presidency than for Republicans. When all types of news are pooled into a single analysis, our results are highly significant. However, the results vary greatly depending upon which economic numbers are being reported. When GDP growth is reported, Republicans received between 16 and 24 percentage point fewer positive stories for the same economic numbers than Democrats. For durable goods for all newspapers, Republicans received between 15 and 25 percentage points fewer positive news stories than Democrats. For unemployment, the difference was between zero and 21 percentage points. Retail sales showed no difference. Among the Associated Press and the top 10 papers, the Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Associated Press, and New York Times tend to be the least likely to report positive news during Republican administrations, while the Houston Chronicle slightly favors Republicans. Only one newspaper treated one Republican administration significantly more positively than the Clinton administration: the Los Angeles Times&#8217; headlines were most favorable to the Reagan administration, but it still favored Clinton over either Bush administration. We also find that the media coverage affects people&#8217;s perceptions of the economy. Contrary to the typical impression that bad news sells, we find that good economic news generates more news coverage and that it is usually covered more prominently. We also present some evidence that media treats parties differently when they control both the presidency and the congress. </p></blockquote>
<p>Consider this:<br />
<blockquote><em><strong>When GDP growth is reported, Republicans received between 16 and 24 percentage point fewer positive stories for the same economic numbers than Democrats. </strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Ranking <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">annualized real GDP per capita among Presidential administrations</a> produces this:</p>
<p>1.  JFK/LBJ  (3.48% annualized)<br />2.  Clinton (2.49%)<br />3.  Reagan (2.45%)<br />4.  Carter (2.14%)<br />5.  Nixon/Ford  (1.70%)<br />6.  GW  (1.37%)<br />7.  Ike  (1.11%)<br />8.  GHW  (0.93%)</p>
<p>Given that, under what circumstances would there be the same proportion of positive stories about the economy under Rep and under Dem administrations?  (I note&#8230; the Lott &#038; Hassett piece is from 2004&#8230;  GW&#8217;s figures would look worse if I were to use only data available at the time they wrote the piece.)  </p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s this:<br />
<blockquote><em><strong>Only one newspaper treated one Republican administration significantly more positively than the Clinton administration: the Los Angeles Times&#8217; headlines were most favorable to the Reagan administration, but it still favored Clinton over either Bush administration.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Given that Clinton outperformed Reagan at real growth, as well as most other metrics we&#8217;ve been looking at here at Angry Bear over the past few months&#8230; isn&#8217;t giving Reagan more favorable headlines than Clinton a sign of bias?  Seriously?  As to comparing Clinton to the two Bush Presidents&#8230;  the annualized real GDP per capita growth rate under Clinton was greater than GW&#8217;s added to GHW&#8217;s.  Of course he got better press.  </p>
<p>Its like Lott and Hassett watch a 100 meter race in which they&#8217;re rooting for losers who somehow or other find a way to get themselves lapped, and then complain their guys don&#8217;t get the same favorable press as the winners.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iprsonline.org/unctadictsd/docs/6.6Securityexpectations_update.pdf">This site</a> has information on security concerns associated wtih trade:</p>
<blockquote><p>Article 73 Security Exceptions<br />Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed:<br />(a) to require a Member to furnish any information the disclosure of which it<br />considers contrary to its essential security interests; or<br />(b) to prevent a Member from taking any action which it considers necessary for<br />the protection of its essential security interests;<br />(i) relating to fissionable materials or the materials from which they are derived;<br />(ii) relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such<br />traffic in other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the<br />purpose of supplying a military establishment;<br />(iii) taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations; or<br />(c) to prevent a Member from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations<br />under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international peace<br />and security.<br />1. Introduction: terminology, definition and scope<br />Although there is a relatively widespread tendency among scholars to perceive<br />international trade law as a concept differing from the classical idea of state<br />sovereignty and to regard national security, borders and territory as state interests<br />difficult to reconcile with liberalization of markets,203 the provision of Article 73,<br />almost identical to Article XXI of the GATT and Article XIV bis of the GATS,<br />proves that these traditional state interests continue to be a major concern of<br />WTO Members.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the question is ongoing.  &#8220;Strategic sectors&#8221; and procurement exceptions make for complications.  In other Articles there are restrictions on using national security as a way to protect an industry or service.</p>

<p>One of Rudy’s defenders provided his now infamous Laffer Curve quote from the Iowa debates as a comment to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/ezra-klein-on-rudolph-laffer-giuliani.html">this post</a>.  Rudy is trying to say that nominal tax revenues during his tenure as NYC mayor because he cut tax rates.  Hmm.  His tenure sort of coincided with Bill Clinton’s tenure as President of the United States.  Federal revenues in 2001 were almost 53 percent greater than they were in 1994 according to <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">this source</a>.  In general, state&#038; local revenues nationwide went up by more than 45 percent during this period.  So a 40 percent nominal increase is no great achievement during a period where inflation remained positive and the entire nation was enjoying strong economic growth.  </p>
<p>Is Rudy saying reduction in local tax rates are more important than the increase in the Federal tax rate passed in 1993?  This would be a departure from the rightwing spin on whether the tax code is progressive.  Right wingers – and one of the economic advisors to Mitt Romney – love to tell us how progressive the Federal tax code is as if state and local taxes didn’t exist.  At the end of the day, most states were cutting tax rates as the Clinton boom led to more revenues – which allowed these balanced budget constrained entities to lower their tax rates.  Of course, California had this rather long-run sensibility of a rainy day fund – albeit I suspect Governor Gray Davis didn’t respect as much as I would have wanted him too.  More on this former governor later.  </p>
<p>Something that bothers me with the supply-side stupidity of folks like Rudy is how they abuse tax revenue growth numbers as some proxy for alleged increases in economic growth rates.  The reality at the national level is that average annual growth rates were only 3 percent during the Reagan-Bush41 era and have been less than 3 percent under Bush43.  Compare that to the 3.5 percent growth rates observed between 1950 and 1980 or the above 3.5 percent growth rates observed during the Clinton boom – and one has to wonder what these supply-siders have been smoking.  But let’s take a look at our graph, which uses more data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis that shows real GDP by state.  We have graphed New York as well as the overall US economy plus my home state – California (CA).  NY did enjoy a 15.8 percent increase in real GDP from 1997 to 2000 but the nation enjoyed a 13.1 percent increase.  Both pale in comparison to California’s 23.4 percent increase.  But this Clinton boom didn’t last and we did have the 2001 recession, which hit California particularly hard.  And yes, NY’s real GDP fell in 2002.  But then they did suffer more from 9/11.  If one compares real GDP in 2006 to real GDP in 1997, NY enjoyed an overall increase of 34.1 percent as compared to the 31 percent national increase.  Again – California’s increase was 45.6 percent.</p>
<p>Rudy wants us to believe that NY’s real GDP increase would never have occurred had he not cut local tax rates.  Imagine how California Republicans would have reacted if Gray Davis claimed that the California boom was due to the fact that he temporarily suspended our car tax.  Of course, when we had our California recession, Governor Davis reinstated the car tax.  So California voters replaced Gray Davis with Arnold.  Arnold wants us to believe that he was personally responsible for the California recovery.  This claim comes on the heels of him not cutting taxes as he spends like a liberal Democrat.  Look – the political affiliation of our governor has had nothing to do with the behavior of California’s real GDP.  And for Rudy to suggest that his paltry tax law changes caused the boom in the late 1990’s has to rank as the stupid claim from the supply-side crowd.  Lawrence Kudlow and Donald Luskin move over – Rudolph Giuliani is making a strong bid for Stupidest Man Alive!</p>

                                <p>Apparently there are pro-anorexia and pro-bulimia websites out there &#8211; i.e., sites for people who have these problems but are looking for tips to have this problem more intensively, as opposed to people looking to fight the problem. There&#8217;s an article <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6935768.stm">here</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really sure what to say about this &#8211; its mostly outside my usual frame of reference. I&#8217;m OK with people committing suicide, even if they do it really slowly, and in effect, it seems to me that some of the users of such sites are doing just that. (Perhaps I&#8217;m completely mistaken, but I don&#8217;t think so.) I do draw the line at allowing minors this right, just as minors aren&#8217;t allowed other rights as well. Since most of the users seem to be minors, part of me wants these sites to be illegal. But part of me thinks its better for them to be out in the open.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s as far as my thoughts go. Yours?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.citizen.org/trade/forms/gats_search.cfm"><strong>Public Citizen</strong></a> offers a description of the impact of the GATS ruling on US gambling:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The WTO Appellate Body’s 2005 ruling in the U.S.-Gambling case.</strong> One of the most important WTO rulings concerning GATS was on a challenge to U.S. Internet gambling policy. Although the United States succeeded in convincing the WTO Appellate Body that U.S. laws banning Internet gambling could be justified under the “public morals” General Exception to the GATS (with the exception of the Interstate Horse Racing Act), the United States lost three significant aspects of its case that have broad implications:</p>
<p><strong>The United States Committed Gambling</strong>: U.S. trade lawyers argued that they did not intend to subject gambling services to GATS authority when they signed up “recreational services” to the GATS in 1995. However, over the strenuous objections of the U.S. government, the WTO Appellate Body declared that the United States had committed gambling to the GATS, because “gambling” is a <strong>subsector of “recreational services”</strong> in the UN concordance of goods and services definitions used by most WTO members to make their GATS commitments. Because of this ruling, all federal, state and local laws governing gambling must comply with GATS rules. GATS rules prohibit certain limits on the number of service suppliers (e.g. on the number of casinos), prohibit monopolies (e.g. monopolistic state lotteries) and prohibit exclusive service provider arrangements (e.g. Indian gaming compacts). The United States is now vulnerable to additional WTO challenges against these common state policies. </p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Bans Violate Commitments</strong>: The WTO Appellate Body also ruled in the gambling case that a regulatory ban in a GATS-covered service sector constitutes a <strong>“quota of zero”</strong> – in violation of GATS market access rules that prohibit numerical limits on service operations. Thus, policies criminalizing certain acts or banning certain activities, even if they treat domestic and foreign companies alike, are now presumptively WTO-illegal if a government has made unconditional GATS commitments in a particular service sector. This implicates not only the complete and partial gambling bans held by some states and localities, but also the regulatory bans in other service sectors that the United States has signed up, or is intending to sign up, to the GATS. The United States so far has made no effort to review its past commitments to protect regulatory bans in covered areas, implicating innumerable policies. For instance, the United States has not moved to qualify its existing “advertising services” commitment to protect common state and local bans on billboard advertising, even though this was an example the U.S. lawyers raised in the gambling case, when they unsuccessfully argued that equating a regulatory ban with a “quota of zero” would undercut numerous existing policies. </p>
<p><strong>Ambiguity in the Schedules Can Be Hazardous</strong>: The gambling example illustrates that a lack of clarity in the schedules can be hazardous to the public interest and state sovereignty. So far, the United States has made no effort to bring its gambling laws into compliance with the WTO ruling, and also has ignored calls by 29 state Attorneys General to withdraw the gambling sector altogether from U.S. GATS commitments. The WTO Appellate Body ruled that it is the responsibility of a WTO member country making a GATS commitment to clear up ambiguity about what its services commitments cover. In its 2005 Revised Offer, the United States has attempted to increase clarity by incorporating UN service classifications. But problems remain because: a) the United States has not done this consistently; b) the UN code has severe flaws &#8211; for instance, “services incidental to fishing” may mean only a few services related to fishing or all activities involved in fishing if they are done under contract; c) the United States continues to rely on footnotes of dubious legality, and other methods of limiting its commitments, that may or may not stand up in the event of a challenge in the WTO dispute system. </p></blockquote>
<p>Please note both the demands and the ambiguities.  Also, number of casinos in a jurisdiction, state lotteries, and  casinos on reservations come under GATS rules.  The US also is not protecting other services in this area from previous agreements, so similar liberalization can happen, such as mentioned in advertising. (Bolding is mine.)</p>

                                <p>What happens when we prostitute our economy, and especially manufacturing, to the Chinese?</p>
<p>&#8220;China threatens &#8216;nuclear option&#8217; of dollar sales</p>
<p>By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard<br />Last Updated: 9:54am BST 08/08/2007</p>
<p>The Chinese government has begun a concerted campaign of economic threats against the United States, hinting that it may liquidate its vast holding of US treasuries if Washington imposes trade sanctions to force a yuan revaluation.</p>
<p>Two officials at leading Communist Party bodies have given interviews in recent days warning &#8211; for the first time &#8211; that Beijing may use its $1.33 trillion (£658bn) of foreign reserves as a political weapon to counter pressure from the US Congress.</p>
<p>Shifts in Chinese policy are often announced through key think tanks and academies.</p>
<p>Described as China&#8217;s &#8220;nuclear option&#8221; in the state media, such action could trigger a dollar crash at a time when the US currency is already breaking down through historic support levels&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>More tainted toothpaste has been discovered in Ohio and Michigan, made in China of course.</p>
<p>Now what are the economists and politicians recommending? Whoring our economy to the Chinese hasn&#8217;t worked so well.</p>
