<p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant Clay Hanna looks sick and white. Like his colleagues he does not seem to sleep. Hanna says he catches up by napping on a cot between operations in the command centre, amid the noise of radio. He is up at 6am and tries to go to sleep by 2am or 3am. But there are operations to go on, planning to be done and after-action reports that need to be written. And war interposes its own deadly agenda that requires his attention and wakes him up.<br />When he emerges from his naps there is something old and paper-thin about his skin, something sketchy about his movements as the days go by.</p>
<p>The Americans he commands, like the other men at Sullivan &#8211; a combat outpost in Zafraniya, south east Baghdad &#8211; hit their cots when they get in from operations. But even when they wake up there is something tired and groggy about them. They are on duty for five days at a time and off for two days. When they get back to the forward operating base, they do their laundry and sleep and count the days until they will get home. It is an exhaustion that accumulates over the patrols and the rotations, over the multiple deployments, until it all joins up, wiping out any memory of leave or time at home. Until life is nothing but Iraq.</p>
<p>Hanna and his men are not alone in being tired most of the time. A whole army is exhausted and worn out. You see the young soldiers washed up like driftwood at Baghdad&#8217;s international airport, waiting to go on leave or returning to their units, sleeping on their body armour on floors and in the dust.</p>
<p>Where once the war in Iraq was defined in conversations with these men by untenable ideas &#8211; bringing democracy or defeating al-Qaeda &#8211; these days the war in Iraq is defined by different ways of expressing the idea of being weary. It is a theme that is endlessly reiterated as you travel around Iraq. &#8216;The army is worn out. We are just keeping people in theatre who are exhausted,&#8217; says a soldier working for the US army public affairs office who is supposed to be telling me how well things have been going since the &#8216;surge&#8217; in Baghdad began.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>They are not supposed to talk like this. We are driving and another of the public affairs team adds bitterly: &#8216;We should just be allowed to tell the media what is happening here. Let them know that people are worn out. So that their families know back home. But it&#8217;s like we&#8217;ve become no more than numbers now.&#8217;</p>
<p>The first soldier starts in again. &#8216;My husband was injured here. He hit an improvised explosive device. He already had a spinal injury. The blast shook out the plates. He&#8217;s home now and has serious issues adapting. But I&#8217;m not allowed to go back home to see him. If I wanted to see him I&#8217;d have to take leave time (two weeks). And the army counts it.&#8217;</p>
<p>A week later, in the northern city of Mosul, an officer talks privately. &#8216;We&#8217;re plodding through this,&#8217; he says after another patrol and another ambush in the city centre. &#8216;I don&#8217;t know how much more plodding we&#8217;ve got left in us.&#8217;</p>
<p>When the soldiers talk like this there is resignation. There is a corrosive anger, too, that bubbles out, like the words pouring unbidden from a chaplain&#8217;s assistant who has come to bless a patrol. &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you tell the truth? Why don&#8217;t you journalists write that this army is exhausted?&#8217;</p>
<p>But the exhaustion of the US army emerges most powerfully in the details of these soldiers&#8217; frayed and worn-out lives. Everywhere you go you hear the same complaints: soldiers talk about divorces, or problems with the girlfriends that they don&#8217;t see, or about the children who have been born and who are growing up largely without them.</p>
<p>&#8216;I counted it the other day,&#8217; says a major whose partner is also a soldier. &#8216;We have been married for five years. We added up the days. Because of Iraq and Afghanistan we have been together for just seven months. Seven months &#8230; We are in a bad place. I don&#8217;t know whether this marriage can survive it.&#8217;</p>
<p>The anecdotal evidence on the ground confirms what others &#8211; prominent among them General Colin Powell, the former US Secretary of State &#8211; have been insisting for months now: that the US army is &#8216;about broken&#8217;. Only a third of the regular army&#8217;s brigades now qualify as combat-ready. Officers educated at the elite West Point academy are leaving at a rate not seen in 30 years, with the consequence that the US army has a shortfall of 3,000 commissioned officers &#8211; and the problem is expected to worsen.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>And it is not only the soldiers that are worn out. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have led to the destruction, or wearing out, of 40 per cent of the US army&#8217;s equipment, totalling at a recent count $212bn (£105bn).</p>
<p>But it is in the soldiers themselves &#8211; and in the ordinary stories they tell &#8211; that the exhaustion of the US military is most obvious, coming amid warnings that soldiers serving multiple Iraq deployments, now amounting to several years, are 50 per cent more likely than those with one tour to suffer from acute combat stress.</p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have said this is a different sort of war and was taking a much heavier toll on our troops than admitted by the powers that be. Fourth generation warfare demands re-thinking some of our priorities, especially by proponents of global conflict and defense who demand sacrifice. Especially before next April when desparation becomes the rule of the day.</p>
<p>Karl Rove gets to go home now to salvage his family from the long haul. And Mitt&#8217;s boys are hard at work in Iowa, keeping us safe from the Dems. My worry is for the citizens.</p>

                                <p>Colleges fail to curb nursing shortage<br />Too few teachers means half of applicants turned away</p>
<p>Karen Bouffard / The Detroit News</p>
<p>WYANDOTTE &#8212; A faculty shortage and lack of money have Michigan&#8217;s 53 nursing schools turning away half of their applicants, exacerbating a looming shortage that some fear could close operating rooms in the next few years.</p>
<p>Amid high unemployment and a drive to re-educate the state&#8217;s work force, nursing school applications in Michigan nearly doubled to 16,000 in the past three years. But roughly half are denied or put on waiting lists for up to two years, as state officials scramble to avoid a shortage of 18,000 nurses predicted by 2015.</p>
<p>The crunch has some sounding alarms about the quality of health care as baby boomers reach retirement.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re short 18,000, that&#8217;s an absolute crisis,&#8221; said Jeanette Klemczak, the state&#8217;s first chief nurse executive, appointed by Gov. Jennifer Granholm in 2004 to develop a plan to stop the shortage. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t have those nurses, we&#8217;re going be in a dire situation. We&#8217;ll find ourselves with closed operating rooms and less hospital beds available to patients. It will slow down the whole delivery of the health care process.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is nationwide, but the crunch is acute in Metro Detroit. Wayne County Community College has 933 students on waiting lists, while Oakland Community College turned away 300. At Henry Ford Community College, 7,000 students list nursing as majors but the school can only admit 340 per year……………………  [see www.detnews.com for the full article].</p>
<p>*          *          *          *          *          *</p>
<p>This problem has been obvious for more than a decade, but our (nationwide) university system, and especially our state-funded schools, are busy cranking out majors for which there are no jobs. This is a major resource allocation problem.</p>

<blockquote><p>Medicare Part D was a betrayal of conservatism. Conservatives are supposed to see fiscal responsibility as their friend, precisely because the need to pay for what the government does should constrain the overall size of that government. This Administration let go of fiscal responsibility early in its first term and has been undermined by its absence ever since. (With the current budget target, weak as it is, we are essentially in a pay-as-you-go situation, so it&#8217;s not quite so bad.)</p>
<p>The President&#8217;s attempt at Social Security reform was the first casualty. The reason to reform Social Security is its long-term fiscal imbalance. The President understood that, even if his rhetoric was at times hyperbolic or misleading. The President lost all credibility on using that as a motivation for reform when he decided that the short-term non-entitlement budget imbalances &#8220;don&#8217;t matter&#8221; and when he passed a Medicare expansion whose unfunded obligations were larger than those in Social Security. That was contradiction number one … </p>
<p>Contradiction number two came from the President&#8217;s statements that he wanted to &#8220;strengthen&#8221; the system. It is reasonable to believe that strengthening an entitlement program means putting more resources into it. There was no plan put forward by the Administration, even in the form of a trial balloon, that tried to strengthen the system with new resources. That doesn&#8217;t mean the proposals were bad ideas, but it does mean that the honest description of what his plans due is to pare back projected future spending so that it is balanced by projected future revenues. The President&#8217;s intentions here were both conservative and (to use Rove&#8217;s word) ambitious. They just weren&#8217;t presented coherently, and so they got nowhere.</p>
<p>This notion that the President&#8217;s legacy on matters of fiscal policy &#8211; which will be written by historians (and bloggers!) that Rove can&#8217;t spin &#8211; will be anything but a severe and harsh critique is what I consider the Myth of Rove.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Andrew did work for this Administration for a while, I sense he never drank the Kool Aid.  I hope more conservatives can speak up as to how this White House has utterly failed us on fiscal policy.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This is a first post for me as a member of Angry Bear contributors. I have several posts full of pretty charts, ground breaking medical news that I believe will impact health care and environmental issues together, and more of course on WTO GATS, but decided to keep this simple and everyday. Up to this point cactus has corrected my html errors with grace and patience, but now I am responsible for the look. Score one for ownership. This one has no html quirks.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dan and I had to shop for a new stove. We did have one with a glass top but it cracked a few years ago, and tops carry limited warranty anyway. We looked for one of the old-fashioned kind with electric coils, and discovered that no matter where we went, big or small stores carried only ONE stove that had electric coils out of extensive inventories of glass topped stoves. Our lonely choice was half to a third the price of comparable stoves, but did not have the automatic setting to 350 degree F. with the on switch, and had a couple manual knobs instead of digital mechanisms.</p>
<p>The price of the model we bought was the same at two stores who carried our choice, one a national chain and the other local. We bought at the national chain because installation was &#8216;free&#8217; (true for us as immediate consumers), taking away the old stove was $10, as part of the sales tax free day in MA it was offered that day with a 15% sale price reduction plus 10% off as part of an advertised regular special, and then the common 5% savings from the uncollected state sales tax for that day. If this sounds like the Fed budget discussions, do not go there.<br />With the $190 savings Mrs. Dan bought a couch day bed for the office (which somehow cost more than $190, but I am a child of the 21st century, so it is to be expected). I was struck by the preponderance of gadgets at twice to three times the cost in the Gilded Age of kitchens. Granite counter tops are the rage.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, for $40,000, we had a new shingled roof (hired), renovated the laundry room, re-painted the downstairs walls in a striking bold color scheme, new kitchen floor (hired), re-finished old oak flooring, new forced water boiler, more insulation, and re-painted the outside of the house with new fascia boards and new screens for the porch. I have two sons and a daughter who spent time from far parts of the US to provide paid labor and expertise, but I am still able to paint 35&#8242; up a peak.</p>
<p>It did not dawned on me that this accomplishment could be unique to a degree and old-fashioned. Hands on is quite valuable if you can try and creates value other than buying the work, and the money lost from &#8216;work&#8217; as vacation (self-employed) for me is outweighed by the value of doing and connection. Adventure vacations are fun, but I think this marks many things for family values that no adventure vacation can touch.</p>
<p>Score one for ownership of work, family, and values. This old progressive is glad to join the fray.</p>

                                <p>Cuba doesn&#8217;t work.  Period, end of story.  Similarly, the old USSR.  Why?  Well, the economic system is untenable.  Motivations and constraints produce predictable human behavior (even if many people refuse to predict that behavior and prefer to assume that the outcomes will be different from what common sense would dictate).  But the opposite is also true &#8211; a system with no controls doesn&#8217;t work either.  We&#8217;ve had a few examples of libertarian gun toting paradise &#8211; most recently Somalia &#8211; and things just don&#8217;t work there either.</p>
<p>And within the narrow range of experience of American politics, its clear that one party <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/this-post-looks-at-disposable-income-by.html">is better at producing sustainable growth in income for individuals</a> than the other.</p>
<p>Which leads to a post by <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_08_12_archive.html#2705621061922715471">Atrios</a> who links to this story by <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L12364166.htm">Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Years of economic policy mistakes after the fall of Saddam Hussein left unemployed young Iraqis easy targets for recruitment by al Qaeda and other insurgents, a U.S. Defense Department official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Paul Brinkley, deputy under-secretary of defense for business transformation in Iraq, said Iraq&#8217;s shattered industrial base had to be revitalised to bring down unemployment levels of about 60 percent and help reconciliation.</p>
<p>He said political, social and economic stability would be much easier if factories, many left idle since the 2003 invasion to topple Saddam, could win even a small fraction of the trade the United States conducts every year with economies like China, India, Indonesia and Thailand.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could just get some of that factored into Iraq we&#8217;d uplift the lives of every Iraqi and al Qaeda wouldn&#8217;t have any people to recruit,&#8221; Brinkley told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Brinkley said early economic planners had made the understandable mistake of assuming that a free market would rapidly emerge to replace what he described as Saddam&#8217;s &#8220;kleptocracy&#8221;, and create full employment.</p>
<p>This mistaken assumption led to a series of decisions which &#8220;sowed the seeds of economic malaise and fuelled insurgent sympathies&#8221; after industrial production collapsed and imports flooded in to replace locally made goods.</p>
<p>The Coalition Provisional Authority, headed by American Paul Bremer, was set up by the western allies after the fall of Saddam and largely ran Iraq until June 2004 when an interim Iraqi government took over.</p>
<p>Brinkley said unemployment and under-employment of the proportions in Iraq would create unrest in any country. In a recent Military Review article he said Iraq&#8217;s unrelenting violence &#8220;is in no small part a result of economic distress&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of us have been saying for a while&#8230; the pie in the sky economic plans of this administration have contributed to the current mess in Iraq.  I think back to the first time I posted about Iraq&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t long ago &#8211; November &#8211; but <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/obligatory-post-on-iraq.html">here</a> is what I wrote at the time.</p>

<p>Dukes of Moral Hazard:</p>
<p>The markets are currently having a problem swallowing and digesting some of the pre-packaged “asset backed” mortgage bundles Wall St. has been manufacturing. Currently the “sub-prime” and “Alt-A” mortgages are having their risks “re-priced”. </p>
<p>&#8220;Re-Pricing Risk&#8221; means more expensive mortgages &#8212; and even if the buyers of these securities feel OK about the prime borrowers ability to pay &#8212; there is still the sticky issue of asset-deflation. The underlying collateral is falling in price. What was a nice tail-wind for this asset class is now going the other way. The more RE declines in value &#8212; the harder it will be to securitize, package and re-sell mortgages. High rates will have to be offered to attract buyers of the mortgage debt. Meanwhile &#8212; back at the ranch &#8212; a whole bunch of ARMs are resetting to a new higher number (way higher?) &#8212; that will create more sellers and further tilt the buyer-seller imbalance.</p>
<p>I believe that more than half (two-thirds?) of all mortgages are ultimately securitized – (CDO/MBS) meaning investors must be lined-up or the loans cannot be made. </p>
<p>So what happens to the remaining “good risks” who wish to buy homes? How much will concerns about RE prices (underlying collateral) damage the housing market and create a spiral of falling prices and hesitant mortgage issuers. At its peak residential RE was about 2x the 100-year average price (CPI adjusted [Schiller]). On top of that residential owners equity is way down (despite sharply rising prices) to about 50%. If RE corrects by half (essentially returning to “mean”) – aggregate owners equity might equal around zero. Equity withdrawals and re-fi loans may get quite scarce – with only bargain hunters with solid credit on the buy-side. </p>
<p>How will this play out? We already have a collapsing RE bubble – worse in some places than others – but compounding the asset bubble with mortgage difficulties may prevent markets from clearing. What happens when only “Prime” borrowers with nice down payments can get mortgages? What happens if ARMs ratchet up and people cannot re-fi? Ready for a Mortgage Strike in your town? How about Joe Consumer? What happens to our borrow-and-spend economy when people can’t do either?</p>
<p>Never mind the Stock Market.</p>

                                <p>When I listen to CNN discuss business and economics, I often realize that the Stupidest People on the Planet don’t all write for the National Review.   <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0708/11/cnnitm.01.html">Case in point</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>ROMANS: The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates $1.6 trillion to fix everything up, all our infrastructure problems, dams, roads, tunnels. We did a little bit of math, that&#8217;s about $5,000 for every man, woman and child in America. That is an awful lot of money. Politicians don&#8217;t win elections by saying; you&#8217;re not going to notice anything I&#8217;m going to do but it&#8217;s going to cost you a lot of money. </p>
<p>ASCHER: You know that estimate is a very big number, but it&#8217;s made up of lots of component pieces. I think if you look into it you&#8217;ll see some of the types of infrastructure that they&#8217;re gearing monies towards are really important to you and me every day. Other things are things that could be handled better by the private sector, they would be invested in better so I think you really want to get past the big number and start looking at the components. </p>
<p>VELSHI: That discussion, the private sector that has come up a few times, the idea of having private companies run roads and bridges and tunnels and things like that. How practical is that and where has it worked? </p>
<p>ASCHER: Well it has worked overseas, I mean if you look at places in Asia and Europe, I think in the UK about 15 percent of the roads and bridges have been privatized, they are toll brides, they are toll roads. I mean it certainly worked in Latin America. It&#8217;s worked in a number of places. It&#8217;s been the political environment that&#8217;s not here. The politics is so complicated nobody has been able to get it off the ground.</p></blockquote>
<p>While we often posted on this topic, it was <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002282.html">Max Sawicky</a> who early on put it best:</p>
<blockquote><p>When a government takes a lump sum in exchange for permitting a private firm to manage a road and levy tolls, it is not only privatizing. It is borrowing, worsening its fiscal position. Most states are looking at growing budget shortfalls in the future, as Medicaid costs in particular continue to grow more rapidly than their revenues. The Gov could just as easily contract out operations and management, but keep the tolls for itself. The fact that the money is earmarked to new projects &#8211; investment &#8211; is irrelevant. It&#8217;s still borrowing. You could just as easily keep the roads and float a bond &#8211; also borrowing &#8211; for the new projects. The leasing is not necessary. The political onus against explicit borrowing can warp decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a simple example.  Suppose a state government needs $2 billion in funds to fix its bridges.  Let’s suppose this state owns toll roads that generate $150 million in income per year.  The stupid people at CNN think the only way to raise the $2 billion is to sell the rights to the toll roads to a private firm.  Well, let’s assume that a private firm does purchase these rights for the next 75 years for $2 billion.  Not a bad deal given the fact that the internal rate of return is 7.5 percent.  If the cost of capital were only 5 percent, then the present value of these rights exceeds $2.9 billion.  So our private firm has made $900 million in present value by snookering the taxpayers of this state.  </p>
<p>But we need to fix the bridges now – right?  Yea – and the state could borrow the $2 billion paying $100 million in interest to the bank.  The state still keeps the income from the toll roads and end up better off than it would by selling the rights to the toll roads at a price below their present value.  </p>
<p>When we discussed the privatization of the Indiana toll roads, we had to endure the infestation of our comment box by a troll who seems to be Donald Luskin’s Mini-Me.  But even this troll recognized that the present value comparison was the appropriate framework.  This troll even provided some analysis that claimed the present value of the expected future toll income was less than the price received by the Indiana state government.  Never mind the fact that the assumptions used in this supposed analysis were entirely bogus.  Our troll trusted the analysis anyway.  </p>
<p>But the fools at CNN cannot even get the right conceptual framework.  When the supposed business reporters of a network are dumber than a Luskin Mini-Me, the network needs to fire these business reporters.</p>

                                <p>Reader Noni Mausa sends a link to <a href="http://www.alternet.org/workplace/57180/">this story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The commercial media is telling us two perfectly contradictory stories about the American economy. The first is how wonderfully rich we are in the United States. The stock market&#8217;s booming &#8212; some analysts predict the Dow will break the 15,000 this year &#8212; the economy is expanding at a healthy clip, productivity growth is up and unemployment and inflation are relatively low.</p>
<p>But, at the same time, we&#8217;re also told that we don&#8217;t have the money to pay for a robust social safety net. When it comes to paying for universal health coverage, affording retirement security for our elderly, investing in programs for the poor or educating our children, we need to pinch pennies. According to this story line, we face a looming &#8220;entitlement crisis&#8221; &#8212; we won&#8217;t be able to afford to keep the Baby Boomers in good health and out of poverty, we&#8217;re told, unless we slash their benefits and privatize the programs that their elderly parents enjoy today</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s more in the article &#8211; its worth a read.  But it got me thinking about two old posts&#8230; one on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">Real GDP per capita</a> and one on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/real-median-income-by-presidential.html">real median income</a>.  Using data from those posts, I put together the following graph&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rr9aYEPDINI/AAAAAAAAAkY/TIo7Ml51YjE/s1600-h/real+gdp+per+capita+and+real+median+income.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rr9aYEPDINI/AAAAAAAAAkY/TIo7Ml51YjE/s320/real+gdp+per+capita+and+real+median+income.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Now, neither of these tow series accounts for debt, but basically, the one thing that we can see is that wherever it is increased wealth and productivity is going, its not going to the median worker, which is to say, its not going to at least 50% of the population.  In four of eight administrations starting with Ike, the median real income actually dropped.  Even when the real median income rose, even under Clinton and JFK/LBJ and Reagan, real median income never grew by much as the real GDP per capita.  </p>
<p>Conclusion &#8211; Paris Hilton is becoming more efficient and productive relative to the rest of us.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Some thought experiments about freedom&#8230;</p>
<p>1. Say there are only two countries in the world, Canada and the US. Canada is somewhat socialist-ish, the US is capitalist-ish. Canada allows its citizens to emigrate if they choose, but the US does not allow immigration or even Canadian visitors. Some percentage of Canadians would choose to move to the US if it were allowed, and some percentage would not leave regardless of the opportunity. What percentage falls into either group is unknown. In this case, who restricts the freedom of Canadians &#8211; the Canadian government, or the US government?</p>
<p>2. Consider case 1 again, and say that the US government also doesn&#8217;t allow its citizens to even visit Canada or trade with Canada. Presumably, the percentage of Canadians who would gladly move to the US if given a chance would rise with exposure to Americans. Does this increase the amount by which United States restricts the freedom of Canadians? It certainly seems to increase the restrictions the US places on its own citizens.</p>
<p>3. Consider case 2 again, but this time assume the two countries in the world are the US and Cuba. Cuba does not allow its citizens to visit the US or to leave Cuba. It does allow US citizens to visit Cuba. The US (mostly) doesn&#8217;t allow its citizens to visit Cuba or do business with Cuba, nor does it allow Cuban visitors to the US much less Cubans to immigrate into the US. Obviously, nobody would say the US is more restrictive than Cuba, but it does seem relevant to ask two questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>3a. How restrictive is the US relative to Cuba<br />3b. Is there some amount of the lack of freedom of Cubans that can be blamed on US policy? Consider &#8211; to get to the US, Cubans must not only beat safeguards put in place by Cuba but also safeguards put in place by the US.</p></blockquote>
<p>4. How does case 3 change if there are many countries with policies similar to the US, but only one Cuba?</p>
