                                <p>Two posts from Eschaton about Iraq&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_08_19_archive.html#110166006840654691">Post one</a> links to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/24/world/middleeast/24displaced.html?_r=2&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">this NY Times story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The number of Iraqis fleeing their homes has soared since the American troop increase began in February, according to data from two humanitarian groups, accelerating the partition of the country into sectarian enclaves.</p>
<p>Despite some evidence that the troop buildup has improved security in certain areas, sectarian violence continues and American-led operations have brought new fighting, driving fearful Iraqis from their homes at much higher rates than before the tens of thousands of additional troops arrived, the studies show.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Statistics collected by one of the two humanitarian groups, the Iraqi Red Crescent Organization, indicate that the total number of internally displaced Iraqis has more than doubled, to 1.1 million from 499,000, since the buildup started in February.</p>
<p>Those figures are broadly consistent with data compiled independently by an office in the United Nations that specializes in tracking wide-scale dislocations. That office, the International Organization for Migration, found that in recent months the rate of displacement in Baghdad, where the buildup is focused, had increased by as much as a factor of 20, although part of that rise could have stemmed from improved monitoring of displaced Iraqis by the government in Baghdad, the capital.</p>
<p>The new findings suggest that while sectarian attacks have declined in some neighborhoods, the influx of troops and the intense fighting they have brought are at least partly responsible for what a report by the United Nations migration office calls the worst human displacement in Iraq’s modern history.</p></blockquote>
<p>When the place is completely ethnically cleansed, the violence will decrease. And GW and the cheerleaders will claim vindication.</p>

<blockquote><p>By that I do not mean we, as America, are bigger or better than Iraq as a country. I mean that that sum of our national existence is not bound up in what happens there. The country will go on. Whatever happens, we&#8217;ll recover from it. And whatever might happen, there are things that matter much more to this country&#8217;s future &#8212; like whether we have a functioning military any more, whether our economy is wrecked, whether this country tears itself apart over this catastrophe. But we&#8217;ll go on and look back at this and judge what happened. </p>
<p>Not so for the president. For him, this is it. He&#8217;s not bigger than this. His entire legacy as president is bound up in Iraq. Which is another way of saying that his legacy is pretty clearly an irrecoverable shambles. That is why, as the folly of the enterprise becomes more clear, he must continually puff it up into more and more melodramatic and world-historical dimensions. A century long ideological struggle and the like. For the president a one in a thousand shot at some better outcome is well worth it, no matter what the cost. Because at least that&#8217;s a one in a thousand shot at not ending his presidency with the crushing verdict history now has in store. It&#8217;s also worth just letting things keep on going as they are forever because, like Micawber, something better might turn up. Going double or nothing by expanding the war into Iran might be worth it too for the same reason. For him, how can it get worse? </p>
<p>And when you boil all this down what it comes down to is that the president now has very different interests than the country he purports to lead. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A Canadian Doctor Describes How Socialized Medicine Doesn&#8217;t Work<br />By DAVID GRATZER | Posted Thursday, July 26, 2007 4:30 PM PT <br />I was once a believer in socialized medicine. As a Canadian, I had soaked up the belief that government-run health care was truly compassionate. What I knew about American health care was unappealing: high expenses and lots of uninsured people.</p>
<p>My health care prejudices crumbled on the way to a medical school class. On a subzero Winnipeg morning in 1997, I cut across the hospital emergency room to shave a few minutes off my frigid commute.</p>
<p>Swinging open the door, I stepped into a nightmare: the ER overflowed with elderly people on stretchers, waiting for admission. Some, it turned out, had waited five days. The air stank with sweat and urine. Right then, I began to reconsider everything that I thought I knew about Canadian health care.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Americans live 75.3 years on average, fewer than Canadians (77.3) or the French (76.6) or the citizens of any Western European nation save Portugal&#8230;&#8230; [but] In The Business of Health, Robert Ohsfeldt and John Schneider factor out intentional and unintentional injuries from life-expectancy statistics and find that Americans who don&#8217;t die in car crashes or homicides outlive people in any other Western country.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>And if we measure a health care system by how well it serves its sick citizens, American medicine excels. Five-year cancer survival rates bear this out. For leukemia, the American survival rate is almost 50%; the European rate is just 35%. Esophageal carcinoma: 12% in the U.S., 6% in Europe. The survival rate for prostate cancer is 81.2% here, yet 61.7% in France and down to 44.3% in England â€” a striking variation.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Like many critics of American health care, though, Krugman argues that the costs are just too high: health care spending in Canada and Britain, he notes, is a small fraction of what Americans pay. Again, the picture isn&#8217;t quite as clear as he suggests. Because the U.S. is so much wealthier than other countries, it isn&#8217;t unreasonable for it to spend more on health care. Take America&#8217;s high spending on research and development. M.D. Anderson in Texas, a prominent cancer center, spends more on research than Canada does.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are we throwing the baby out with the bathwater?</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/12639.html">Steve Benen</a>, <a href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/whats-off-the-record-at-nhtsa-almost-everything/">this story</a> in the NY Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want to know something as simple as who heads the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, don’t bother to ask the safety agency’s communications office. Without special permission, officials there are no longer allowed to provide information to reporters except on a background basis, which means it cannot be attributed to a spokesman. </p>
<p>Without such attribution, there are few circumstances under which most reporters will report such information. This makes for interesting dealings with the office charged with providing information about the nation’s top automotive safety agency.</p>
<p>So, I will end the suspense about the boss’s identity. The administrator is Nicole R. Nason, who took over on May 31, 2006, after she was appointed to the post by President Bush.</p>
<p>And it is she who put the big hush on one of the government’s most important safety agencies. I found this out recently when I asked to talk to an N.H.T.S.A. researcher about some technical safety issues in which he had a great deal of expertise. Agency officials told me I could talk to the expert on a background basis, but if I wanted to use any information or quotes from him, that would have to be worked out later with a N.H.T.S.A. official. The arrangement struck me as manipulative, and I declined to agree to it.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>As an alternative I was told I could interview Ms. Nason on the record (instead of the expert on the subject of my article). I declined, failing to see how her appointment as administrator — she was trained as a lawyer — made her a expert in that subject. </p>
<p>When I said I would like to talk to Ms. Nason on the record about her no-attribution policy, she was not available. </p>
<p>The agency’s new policy effectively means that some of the world’s top safety researchers are no longer allowed to talk to reporters or to be freely quoted about automotive safety issues that affect pretty much everybody.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The policy of allowing information to be attributed only to political appointees is intermittently enforced around other parts of the Department of Transportation, including the Federal Railroad Administration. But it is a radical change from the way N.H.T.S.A has operated for at least 20 years. In the past, reporters could talk to its experts and the agency was proud to discuss its research and accomplishments.</p>
<p>Ms. Nason felt it was necessary for N.H.T.S.A. to have a “central spokesperson” and “we were finding a lot of stuff did not need to be on the record,” David Kelly, her chief of staff, told me. He also insisted, after our telephone conversation, that he did not want to be quoted and had intended to speak only on background. (My notes show no such request.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Considering this is N.H.T.S.A., an agency that presumably isn&#8217;t all that heavily involved in National Security, but whose actions do affect the safety of all of us, the natural question is:  what are they hiding?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/09/AR2007080900667_pf.html">The Washington Post</a> published an article by Nathaniel Frick, former Marine captain in counter-insurgeny training in Afghanistan, that makes compelling points.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<p>On a highway north of Kabul last month, an American soldier aimed a machine gun at my car from the turret of his armored Humvee. In the split second for which our eyes locked, I had a revelation: To a man with a weapon, everything looks like a threat.</p>
<p>I had served as an infantry officer in Afghanistan in 2001-02 and in Iraq in 2003, but this was my first time on the other end of an American machine gun. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ll forget. It&#8217;s not the sort of thing ordinary Afghans forget, either, and it reminded me that heavy-handed military tactics can alienate the people we&#8217;re trying to help while playing into the hands of the people we&#8217;re trying to defeat.</p>
<p>Welcome to the paradoxical world of counterinsurgency warfare &#8212; the kind of war you win by not shooting.</p>
<p>The objective in fighting insurgents isn&#8217;t to kill every enemy fighter &#8212; you simply can&#8217;t &#8212; but to persuade the population to abandon the insurgents&#8217; cause. The laws of these campaigns seem topsy-turvy by conventional military standards: Money is more decisive than bullets; protecting our own forces undermines the U.S. mission; heavy firepower is counterproductive; and winning battles guarantees nothing.</p>
<p>My unnerving encounter on the highway was particularly ironic since I was there at the invitation of the U.S. Army to help teach these very principles at the Afghanistan Counterinsurgency Academy. The grandly misnamed &#8220;academy&#8221; is a tiny collection of huts and tents on Kabul&#8217;s dusty southern outskirts. Since May, motley classes of several dozen Afghan army officers, Afghan policemen, NATO officers, American officers and civilians have been learning and living side by side there for a week at a time.</p>
<p>The academy does much more than teach the theory and tactics of fighting the Taliban insurgents who are trying to unseat President Hamid Karzai and claw their way back to power. It is also a rare forum for military officers, civilian aid workers, academics and diplomats &#8212; from Afghanistan and all 37 countries in NATO&#8217;s International Security Assistance Force &#8212; to unite in trying to bring good governance, prosperity and security to Afghanistan. The curriculum is based on the Army and Marine Corps&#8217; new counterinsurgency doctrine, released in December. Classes revolve around four so-called paradoxes of counterinsurgency. Unless we learn all four well, we&#8217;ll continue to win battles in Afghanistan while losing the war.</p>
<p>The first tenet is that the best weapons don&#8217;t shoot. Counterinsurgents must excel at finding creative, nonmilitary solutions to military problems.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Said another way: Reconstruction funds can shape the battlefield as surely as bombs. But such methods are still not used widely enough in Afghanistan. After spending more than $14 billion in aid to the country since 2001, the United States&#8217; latest disbursement, of more than $10 billion, will start this month. Some 80 percent of it is earmarked for security spending, leaving only about 20 percent for reconstruction projects and initiatives to foster good governance.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Afghanistan, however, isn&#8217;t Iraq. Tourists travel through much of the country in relative safety, glass office towers are sprouting up in Kabul, and Coca-Cola recently opened a bottling plant. I drove through the capital in a dirty green Toyota, wearing civilian clothes and stopping to shop in bazaars, eat in restaurants and visit businesses. In two weeks, I saw more of Kabul than most military officers do in a year.</p>
<p>This isolation also infects our diplomatic community. After a State Department official gave a presentation at the academy, he and I climbed a nearby hill to explore the ruins of an old palace. He was only nine days from the end of his 12-month tour, and our walk was the first time he&#8217;d ever been allowed to get out and explore the city.</p>
<p>Of course, mingling with the population means exposing ourselves to attacks, and commanders have an obligation to safeguard their troops. But they have an even greater responsibility to accomplish their mission. When we retreat behind body armor and concrete barriers, it becomes impossible to understand the society we claim to defend. If we emphasize &#8220;force protection&#8221; above all else, we will never develop the cultural understanding, relationships and intelligence we need to win.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The third paradox hammered home at the academy is that the more force you use, the less effective you may be. Civilian casualties in Afghanistan are notoriously difficult to tally, but 300-500 noncombatants have probably been killed already this year, mostly in U.S. and coalition air strikes. Killing civilians, even in error, is not only a serious moral transgression but also a lethal strategic misstep. Wayward U.S. strikes have seriously undermined the very legitimacy of the Karzai government and made all too many Afghans resent coalition forces. If Afghans lose patience with the coalition presence, those forces will be run out of the country, in the footsteps of the British and the Soviets before them.</p>
<p>I stress this point because one of my many gratifying moments at the academy came at the start of a class on targeting. I told the students to list the top three targets they would aim for if they were leading forces in Zabul province, a Taliban stronghold. When I asked a U.S. officer to share his list, he rattled off the names of three senior Taliban leaders to be captured or killed. Then I turned and asked an Afghan officer the same question. &#8220;First we must target the local councils to see how we can best help them,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Then we must target the local mullahs to find out their needs and let them know we respect their authority.&#8221; Exactly. In counterinsurgency warfare, targeting is more about whom you bring in than whom you take out.</p>

<p>Yingling&#8217;s article — published in the May issue of <a href="http://www.armedforcesjournal.com/2007/05/2635198">Armed Forces Journal</a> — noted that a key role of generals is to advise policy makers and the public on the means necessary to win wars. &#8220;If the general remains silent while the statesman commits a nation to war with insufficient means,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;he shares culpability for the results.&#8221; Today&#8217;s generals &#8220;failed to envision the conditions of future combat and prepare their forces accordingly,&#8221; and they failed to advise policy makers on how much force would be necessary to win and stabilize Iraq. These failures, he insisted, stemmed not just from the civilian leaders but also from a military culture that &#8220;does little to reward creativity and moral courage.&#8221; He concluded, &#8220;As matters stand now, a private who loses a rifle suffers far greater consequences than a general who loses a war.&#8221; </p>
<p>General Cody looked around the auditorium, packed with men and women in uniform — most of them in their mid-20s, three decades his junior but far more war-hardened than he or his peers were at the same age — and turned Captain Wignall&#8217;s question around. &#8220;You all have just come from combat, you&#8217;re young captains,&#8221; he said, addressing the entire room. &#8220;What&#8217;s your opinion of the general officers corps?&#8221; </p>
<p>Over the next 90 minutes, five captains stood up, recited their names and their units and raised several of Yingling&#8217;s criticisms. One asked why the top generals failed to give political leaders full and frank advice on how many troops would be needed in Iraq. One asked whether any generals &#8220;should be held accountable&#8221; for the war&#8217;s failures. One asked if the Army should change the way it selected generals. Another said that general officers were so far removed from the fighting, they wound up &#8220;sheltered from the truth&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on.&#8221; &#8230;</p>
<p>In response to the captains&#8217; questions, General Cody acknowledged, as senior officers often do now, that the Iraq war was &#8220;mismanaged&#8221; in its first phases. The original plan, he said, did not anticipate the disbanding of the Iraqi Army, the disruption of oil production or the rise of an insurgency. Still, he rejected the broader critique. &#8220;I think we&#8217;ve got great general officers that are meeting tough demands,&#8221; he insisted. He railed instead at politicians for cutting back the military in the 1990s. &#8220;Those are the people who ought to be held accountable,&#8221; he said. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>I wonder about this. Consider the position of a general. Its 2002 or 2003. He&#8217;s already seen what happens to people who speak up, whether they are generals or not. Its not always easy to speak up &#8211; who wants to end a three decade career by being the guy to step forward? And then there&#8217;s the financial strain. On the other hand, keeping quiet means you are partly responsible for what follows. Its a tough place to be.</p>
<p>So whatever blame accrues to the generals, most of it has to lie with the people who put them in that untenable position &#8211; the administration, the cheerleaders, and those who bought in.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Update&#8230; I also have a question&#8230;. what do you think it does to morale if the folks at the middle and bottom of the chain of command think folks at the top should be held accountable, but aren&#8217;t?</p>

This seems to be the latest feel-good plan from the folks who brought us Iraq. The cheerleaders seem to have started agitating for it a while back, and now its a main-stream meme.</p>
<p>Which raises the question&#8230; given what a hash the administration made of Afghanistan and Iraq, given how thinly stretched US forces are, with what exactly are they planning to hit Iran? Seriously? And considering that Iraq is a different magnitude of problem than Afghanistan, and Iran is a different magnitude of problem than Iraq, what&#8217;s the next step that the guys like Victor Davis Hanson and the Donald Kagan have in mind when Iran is thoroughly screwed up? Four years from now, if Mitt Romney or Rudy Giuliani are in the Oval Office, and US troops are bogged down in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran, what&#8217;s the bigger better nexter thing? Invade India?  Since getting the folks who had anything to do with 9/11 is not on agenda, it frees up all kinds of possibilities to people who like to play Risk.</p>

<p>As a measure of the stock market, I use the price of the S&#038;P 500 on January 20 (or the first weekday after January 20) of each year.  (January 20 happens to be the inauguration date of the President.)  I also adjust the S&#038;P 500 for inflation.</p>
<p>Data on the stock market price comes from <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2007/2007-012.pdf">Yahoo Finance</a>, and data for <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">January’s CPI</a> is used to adjust for inflation.</p>
<p>OK.  Now for some graphs….</p>

<p>From this, we learn…  the stock market rose the most during the Clinton administration.  It rose slowly at first, only speeding up later.  Presumably this is a function of the rapidly growing economy, and the internet and telecom bubble.  My guess is that the incessant drumbeat about how Clinton’s tax cuts were sure to destroy the economy from some quarters also contributed to the slow ramp-up, and it took a few years before realization set in that things were not going to hell.  Interestingly enough, Ike and GHW are second and third.  This is interesting <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">real GDP per capita</a> or <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/this-post-looks-at-disposable-income-by.html">disposable (and after change in debt obligation) real income</a> growth was poor under both.  </p>
<p>Bringing up the rear in real growth… GW, Carter, and Nixon/Ford.  The latter two had to content with inflation, and GW had to contend with the end of the bubble, but also an extremely friendly Fed to mitigate the effect.  In the end, his own ineptitude carried the day and ran with it.  </p>
<p>FWIW, what I wonder about is why Presidents who did pretty well on growth… especially JFK/LBJ, but also Reagan to a lesser extent, didn’t also oversee large increases in the stock market.  Your thoughts?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Reader Empiricman sends me a link to an OECD report entitled <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/51/20/37392850.pdf">Education at a Glance 2006: OECD Briefing Note for the United States</a>.  Some points&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Research shows the important role that education plays in achieving economic success with OECD figures estimating that the long-term effect on economic output of one additional year of education generally lies been 3% and 6%.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>In most OECD countries, a child at the age of five can now expect to undertake between 16 and 21 years of education during his or her lifetime either full or part-time, if present patterns of participation continue. Australia and the United Kingdom, at 20.7 years, show the highest educational expectancy among OECD countries, while in the United States a five year old can expect almost 4 years of education less than that during his/her lifetime.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Changes over time in the attainment rates of a country can be approximated by comparing the attainment rates for older and younger age groups. With 36% of 55-to-64 year-olds in 2003 having completed a tertiary qualification, the United States had the highest tertiary education attainment in the period 35 to 45 years ago, just ahead of Canada with 35%. No other country was above 27%. The United States’rate of 39% for 25-to-34 year olds reveals only a small synthetic growth over the intervening 30 years during which Canada (53%), Japan (52%), Korea (49%) have all grown well clear while Sweden (42%), Belgium (41%) and Ireland (40%) now also surpass the tertiary attainment level of the United States. In rank, the United States has slipped from 1st to equal 7th of OECD countries</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Although the graduation rate for the United States increased slightly over this period, from 33% to 34%, other countries rates’ grew faster with the result that the graduation rate for the United States in 2004 was slightly below the OECD average and well below the highest rates of over 45% reported by Australia, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, New Zealand and Norway&#8230; It should be noted that the graduation rate provides a measure of the quantitative output of education systems and does not allow inferences as regarding to the quality of competences acquired by degree holders.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Rates of current participation suggest that even more countries are likely to catch up and surpass the United States graduation rates. The increase in tertiary enrolment between 1995 and 2003, which will influence future graduation rates in the United States, was, at 21%, considerably below the OECD average level of 38%</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Comparatively high drop out rates in the United States are contributing to the United States’ relative standingagainst other countries. On average across OECD countries some 70% of those who enter tertiary-type A programmes go on to successfully graduate. The “survival rate” for the United States is however one of the lowest of OECD countries for which data are reported, with only just over 50% of the entry cohort achieving graduation, similar to the rate for Mexico and New Zealand</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>While countries like Japan and Korea are projected to increase their share of the tertiary graduates in the OECD, the share held by the United States is projected to fall from 41% to 36% over the next ten years</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The contrast is even more pronounced when comparing the current output of high schools: The proportion of the typical age cohort graduating from upper secondary education in 2004 was 90% or more in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Korea and Norway. At 75%, the graduation rate for the United States was below the OECD average of 81%</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Results relating to 2003 from the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) have previously highlighted the comparatively poor performance in mathematical proficiency, on average, of 15-year-olds in the United States’. Out of the 30 OECD countries taking part in PISA 2003, the average performance for the United States was statistically significantly higher only than that of five countries (Portugal, Italy, Greece, Mexico and Turkey) and statistically lower than that of 20 countries.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The United States invests more than any other country per child at the pre-primary level (at US$ 7,755) considerably more than the OECD average spending per child of US$ 4,508). And yet, the United States has one of the lowest rates of participation amongst under 5-year-olds in education. The rate of participation of 4-year olds and under as a percentage of the 3-to-4-year-old population in 2004 stands at only 53%, below the OECD average of 66% and well below the highest rates of participation, many of which are approaching 100%</p></blockquote>
<p>As Empiricman notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>America has more graduates per capita than most other nations&#8230; but only because of Americans educated 40 years ago.  It seems the US used to have the highest graduation rates in the world, but in the last couple decades, everyone else caught up and passed us.  In fact, the current enrollment and completion rates are below average.  The dropout rates are now the highest in the OECD, on par with Mexico.</p></blockquote>
