                                <p>This post is on real median income for white people, real median income for black people, and the ratio of black to white median income.  The post looks at how these three series evolved over time and by Presidential administration.  As noted in the post on male and female income, the President is in charge of the Justice Department, which in theory is supposed to care about discrimination, so its not a stretch to assume that perhaps the President has some effect, however small, on the gap between black and white income. </p>

<p>So from this… JFK/LBJ, Clinton, and Reagan are 1, 2, and 3 for white income.  GHW and Carter bring up the rear.  JFK/LBJ, Clinton and Reagan are 1, 2 and 3 for black income as well, but there is a difference…  under Clinton, real median income for black people rose by over 2.5 times as much per year as under Reagan.  And while Carter didn’t do so well, the last two slots went to the Bush-league boys.</p>
<p>In terms of closing the gap between white and black income, JFK/LBJ and Clinton did best, and the Bush leaguers did the worst.  But some of the results are kind of perverse…  Reagan, who was third for both white and black median income came in only sixth because relatively, median black income lost ground relative to median white income during his term.</p>
<p>Thus, while these series are imperfect, its not hard to see why some Democratic administrations still engender positive feelings among many black voters.  Its hard to conclude that the two administrations under which black people fared the best relative to other administrations (by a huge margin) just happened to be the two administrations that talked the most about Civil Rights.  Not that I don&#8217;t expect to see that argument made.</p>
<p>Next post in the series… something a little bit different…  we’re gonna go all artsy fartsy…</p>

                                <p>Let it not be said that we Angry Bear won&#8217;t post opinions by those with whom we disagree. CoRev really, really wants to keep discussing Global Warming. His post follows.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Y2K, remember all that fog and fury? Some, me at least, say it was the under pinnings for the great 90s technology bubble. Well that bug struck in an unanticipated place, NASA, and in an unanticipated area, &#8220;Earth Studies.&#8221; Many blog sites, have been reporting that the NASA earth scientist James Hansen (who shot to fame when he accused the administration of trying to censor his views on climate change), and who refused to release his algorithms to independent researchers. Well, his algorithms have been found to be infected with that same Y2K bug.</p>
<p>Steve McIntyre, the same fellow who debunked the Mann &#8220;Hockey Stick&#8221; findings has reverse engineered the NASA algorithms/formulas and notified NASA of their defect(s). Quietly they have corrected them, and the revised results posted to the scientific community on the NASA web site. No notices. No Presser. Nothing to indicate the change. Now the NASA Web page has been changed, to show their newest revisions. It can be found <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/">here.</a></p>
<p>The key chart is for Annual Mean Temperature, 2nd from the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>What was the result? From <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/08/09/hot-news-nasa-fixes-flawed-temperature-data-1998-was-not-the-warmest-year-in-the-millenium/">Michelle Malkin&#8217;s place</a> we have:<br />
<blockquote>NASA has now silently released corrected figures, and the changes are truly astounding. The warmest year on record is now 1934. 1998 (long trumpeted by the media as record-breaking) moves to second place, 1921 takes third. In fact, 5 of the 10 warmest years on record now all occur before World War II. Anthony Watts has put the new data in chart form, along with a more detailed summary of the events.</p></blockquote>
<p>So let&#8217;s take a look at Global Warming in today&#8217;s world. US ground stations are undergoing what may be the first ever survey. </p>
<p>1) Many, maybe even most, of the ground stations have been found to be in Urban Heat Islands (UHIs). Findings from that preliminary survey is that many are in horrible locations or what may be even more important they are in terrible <a href="http://www.norcalblogs.com/watts/weather_stations/">condition.</a>  Take a look at the Great Lakes station to see the temp readings which raised the red flag. Why did they not get noticed by NASA? They are that obvious.  </p>
<p>2) Steve McIntyre has debunked the &#8220;Hockey Stick&#8221; and now some of the NASA data. Both have been corrected reducing their impacts, actually dramatically changing their interpretations. (My interpretation along with many AGW skeptics.) </p>
<p>3) US ground stations are the largest single supplier of temperature data to the world wide community. They are also considered to be the best in quality. Serious issues re: that quality have been rising since the survey started.</p>
<p>To read more Google &#8220;hottest year 1934&#8221;. Lots of links, lots of added information, lots of great comments. Note the relative lack of MSM coverage. Slowly we are seeing some media coverage, WaTimes, Investor Business Daily, Daily Herald (UK), etc have some articles, but the bigger story may be the lack of coverage by the MSM. Clearly the blogosphere has been interested as shown by the Google search.</p>
<p>Why has the media been so silent on this issue? Except of course the conservative media &#8211; <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,292810,00.html">FoxNews</a> had this to say about the new findings:</p>
<blockquote><p>The UK researchers (and most other climate alarmists) are even wrong on the matter of 1998 being the warmest year on record at least for the U.S. According to a new analysis which discovered an error in a NASA dataset, 1934 is the new warmest year on record for the U.S. In fact, four of the warmest 10 years in the U.S. date from the 1930s while only three date from the last 10 years. This is an embarrassing setback for alarmists, especially since about 80 percent of manmade carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions occurred after 1940.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is Global Warming based upon an icy slope made of really, really poor data, accentuated by really poor science? I don&#8217;t know, but being a Global Warming skeptic is actually being reinforced, not attenuated. The IPCC report has consistently lowered its impact statements every report. It is understandable, just from tMcIntyre&#8217;s work, why this keeps happening. </p>
<p>Note: go to <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/">here</a> to get the fair and balanced counter views. Is it a big change or not? I&#8217;ll leave that to you.</p>

<blockquote><p>Clinton says families without health care and single moms trying to find affordable child care are being treated as though they’re invisible to Bush &#8211; and so are soldiers who serve in Iraq and Afghanistan &#8230; White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino lambasted the ad, according to news reports.  “This is a president who, first and foremost, has helped millions of seniors across the country have access to prescription drugs at a much lower cost,” Perino said. “As to whether or not our troops are invisible to this president, I think that is absurd and that it is unconscionable that a member of Congress would say such a thing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though I think Tony Snow is about the most dishonest press secretary I have ever seen, at least he is not as stupid as Dana Perino.  This President is shortchanging certain Americans – especially the children of the working poor and our brave soldiers overseas.  One excuse for these large budget cuts in small programs is that we have a deficit problem.  Of course, we have a deficit problem when the most fiscally irresponsible President ever pretends to cut taxes as he signs a bloated new entitlement program.  Ms. Perino was hoping to go after Senator Clinton but all she just did was to confirm what a fiscal fiasco this Administration has given us.  Could the folks at Faux News please find a position for Dana Perino so she does not have to embarrass the White House even further?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Kind of an idle question. I read <a href="http://www.michaelyon-online.com/wp/three-marks-on-the-horizon.htm">Michael Yon&#8217;s latest dispatch</a> which says things are getting better in Iraq. I hope he&#8217;s right, but I remain skeptical. </p>
<p>I do wonder about something though&#8230; </p>
<blockquote><p>Our military has increasing moral authority in Iraq, but the same cannot be said for our government at home. In fact, it’s in moral deficit because many Iraqis are increasingly frightened we will abandon them to genocide. The Iraqis I speak with couldn’t care less what is said from Washington but large numbers of them pay close attention to what some Marine Gunny says, or what American battalion commanders all over Iraq say. Some of our commanders could probably run for local offices in Iraq, and win.</p></blockquote>
<p>And its a point Yon himself thinks is important&#8230; he ends his dispatch with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Large numbers of Iraqis detested us after the prisoner abuse stories, and some over-the-top attacks on Fallujah, for example. But through time, somehow the American military has managed to establish a moral authority in Iraq. It’s not the only authority, but the military has serious and increasing moral clout. In the beginning, our influence flowed from guns, or dropped from the wings of jets. Later it was the money. Today, the clout still is partially from the gun, and definitely the money is key, but there is an intangible and growing moral clout and it flows from an increasing respect among Iraqis for our military. Washington has no moral clout in Iraq. Washington looks like a circus act. The authority is coming from our military. The importance of this fact would be difficult to overstate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Assume he&#8217;s right. What does this mean for the future of Iraq? To me, it either means the US military must remain there for a very, very long time or there must be some way to transfer that moral authority to some Iraqi institution. If an Iraqi institution is capable of, shall we say, absorbing through osmosis some of that moral authority the US military has developed, presumably it would be the military and/or police. Leaving aside questions of how, um, ethnically cleansed branches of the military and/or police happen to be at this time, is it a healthy thing for the moral authority of the country to be invested in the military and/or police?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about Turkey, but what I&#8217;ve read seems to indicate that the military does enjoy a reputation as being the most honest institution in the country. (Is that true? Am I way off-base here?) Are there other examples where this is true? And is it a good thing in the long term? What is the best case scenario for what Iraq will look like in ten years? Twenty?</p>

<blockquote><p>China is a responsible investor in international financial markets, and our country&#8217;s foreign exchange reserves are managed with the operational goals of safety, liquidity and profit,&#8221; Xinhua quoted the central bank official as saying. The People&#8217;s Bank does not disclose the composition of the foreign exchange reserves, which have swelled in recent years as China&#8217;s exports surged and investors poured money into the country to profit from an economy now in its fourth straight year of double-digit growth. But the reserves have become a political issue both within China and between Beijing and Washington. As the dollar has fallen in value, the People&#8217;s Bank has come under pressure to diversify its holdings to maintain the value of the reserves and improve returns.</p>
<p><a title="http://money.aol.com/news/articles/_a/china-eases-foreign-exchange-controls/n20070814014109990001">Aol money also reports</a>:</p>
<p>China has scrapped rules that required local companies to convert a portion of their foreign earnings into Chinese currency, the government said Tuesday, in a move that could ease pressure on Beijing&#8217;s foreign exchange system. Companies now will be allowed to decide on their own how to use money earned abroad, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said on its Web site. Previous rules requiring companies to convert at least 20 percent of foreign earnings into Chinese yuan boosted demand for the currency, increasing pressure for it to rise against the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies.</p>
<p>The latest change could help to slow the growth of China&#8217;s $1.3 trillion foreign reserves accumulated by the central bank as it tries to curb pressure for prices to rise by draining money from the economy through bond sales. &#8220;This policy revision is an important reform in foreign exchange management,&#8221; the agency said on its Web site. &#8220;The implementation of the new policy will improve the autonomy and convenience of domestic companies, strengthen companies&#8217; capital management and improve the international balance of payments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until 2002, Chinese companies were required to bring home all the money they made abroad and obtain government permission to make new foreign investments. Beginning in 2002, companies were allowed to keep 20 percent of foreign revenues. That was raised to 50 percent in 2004 and 80 percent the following year.</p>

<p>Is this a quiet move to loosen reliance on US treasuries? What else does it accomplish?</p>

<p>It’s bad enough that you cite the Stupid Man Alive on any economic issue.  When Luskin says “the price of risk” is zero, what is he babbling about?  If he is defining risk as diversifiable risk, he has finally discovered the Arbitrage Pricing Theorem.  Or is he saying the price of systematic risk is zero?  If that were the case, the expected return to stocks would equal the risk-free rate.   So much for his free lunch solution to the alleged Social Security crisis that he keeps babbling about.  No – I suspect he is referring to the price of credit risk, which in an efficient market would represent the expected losses from possible defaults on credit.  </p>
<p>So what is a normal level for something like a credit spread and has this spread been zero recently?  Well, let’s look at the difference between interest rates on BBB rated corporate bonds and the ten-year Federal bond rate as a proxy for this idea (if Luskin has a better measure, it’s a shame he failed to mention it).  It would seem that this credit spread has not been zero for the past several years.  In fact, it was higher in 2002 and 2003 than it is today.  So when Donald Luskin claims people have “gorged for years on a zero price of risk” – he has no idea what he is talking about.  And neither does James Pethokoukis.  Yet – Pethokoukis relies on Donald Luskin as some alleged subject matter expert.  Dumb and dumber!</p>

                                <p>This post is on men’s income, women’s income, and how the two compare, using data from <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p05ar.html">the Census</a> which goes back to 1953.  FWIW, I think this is something Dems care about more than Reps.  The comparison between males and females is not perfect… they may work different hours, and on different jobs.  Still, its an interesting look at how society has evolved over time.  As is my usual practice, I’m going to look at things by Presidential administration.  Does the President have much to do with?  Well, some.  The President is in charge of the Justice Department, and the Justice Department, in theory, looks into discrimination, and even can file suit if it deems necessary.  Presidents also nominate judges who may look more or less favorable at such issues.  </p>

<p>Since 1953, real median income for females has grown faster (1.83% per year) than real income for males has grown (0.87%) … thus narrowing the gap.  Not a surprise… women were virtually second class citizens in 1953.  </p>
<p>What else do we see…  real median incomes for men fared best under JFK/LBJ, Ike and Clinton, with the Bush boys bringing up the rear.  (That last part of the sentence seems to be true a lot in this series of posts, doesn’t it?)  Female median income fared best under JFK/LBJ, Reagan, and Clinton with GW and Ike at the back of the pack.   But the President who did “best” at income equality was GHW… mostly because he was in the middle of the pack for female real median income growth, while male real median income growth in his administration cratered.  JFK/LBJ, under whom both genders fared the best, falls in the middle of the pack when it comes to gender income inequality.  It seems a pretty perverse result, frankly.  Maybe this ratio is not such a good measure after all.  </p>
<p>For my next post in the series, I want to look at income in black and white, so to speak, and see if the same thing applies.</p>

                                <p>A reader who chooses to remain nameless sent me a link to this post at <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/174828">Tom Dispatch.com</a> looking at Iraq by the numbers.  I can&#8217;t really excerpt any bit of it &#8230;  its worth reading in its entirety.</p>
<p>And via <a href="http://sideshow.me.uk/saug07.htm#08131932">Avedon Carol</a>, a story at <a href="http://brilliantatbreakfast.blogspot.com/2007/08/blackout.html">Brilliant at Breakfast</a> about why recruitment is down among African Americans:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;In 2000, &#8220;Jackson reported, &#8220;23.5 percent of Army recruits were African-American.  By 2005, the percentage dropped to 13.9 percent.  National Public Radio this week quoted a Pentagon statistic that said African-American propensity to join the military had dropped to 9 percent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the phrasing of that quote is a bit off, but the conclusion is obvious:  you simply cannot trust black people to do what is right.  This dates back at least to the War of Yankee Aggression, where black people refused to stand up for States Rights like real (i.e., Southern and white) Americans even to defend their own status as three-fifths of a human being with none of the rights, which was really the only Right the States really cared about.  And now, on aggregate their behavior is equally shameful.  Given that most black people are poorer than average, it is their duty to put themselves in danger in a war whose rationale keeps shifting if only to ensure that the College Republicans can stay here and &#8220;fight the war of ideas&#8221;  (which from what I can tell means to convince the rest of us we should be out fighting in Iraq because a bunch of illiterates in Pakistan think they can make the world into caliphate or something).</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/08/why-oh-why-ca-2.html">Brad DeLong</a> comes a challenge to certain survey evidence from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/weekinreview/12kolata.html?ei=5090&#038;en=5a5deddcacff185c&#038;ex=1344571200&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss&#038;pagewanted=print">Gina Kolata</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In study after study and in country after country, men report more, often many more, sexual partners than women.  One survey, recently reported by the federal government, concluded that men had a median of seven female sex partners. Women had a median of four male sex partners. Another study, by British researchers, stated that men had 12.7 heterosexual partners in their lifetimes and women had 6.5.<br />But there is just one problem, mathematicians say. It is logically impossible for heterosexual men to have more partners on average than heterosexual women. Those survey results cannot be correct. It is about time for mathematicians to set the record straight, said David Gale, an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. “Surveys and studies to the contrary notwithstanding, the conclusion that men have substantially more sex partners than women is not and cannot be true for purely logical reasons,” Dr. Gale said. He even provided a proof, writing in an e-mail message:</p>
<p>“By way of dramatization, we change the context slightly and will prove what will be called the High School Prom Theorem. We suppose that on the day after the prom, each girl is asked to give the number of boys she danced with. These numbers are then added up giving a number G. The same information is then obtained from the boys, giving a number B. </p>
<p>Theorem: G=B</p>
<p>Proof: Both G and B are equal to C, the number of couples who danced together at the prom. Q.E.D.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ll return to Brad who spotted a major error but let’s finish with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>One is that men are going outside the population to find partners, to prostitutes, for example, who are not part of the survey, or are having sex when they travel to other countries. Another, of course, is that men exaggerate the number of partners they have and women underestimate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this an estimation problem or is it as Brad notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our own David Gale from the tenth floor is made to look ridiculous by Gina Kolata &#8211; you see, she didn&#8217;t tell him that the survey didn&#8217;t ask about means &#8211; about averages = but about medians. Which means that she doesn&#8217;t know the difference between means and medians.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s speculate a bit.  Suppose these sample medians do capture the population medians.  That means about the half the men have 13 partners or more.  I doubt many of them have more than 15 or 20.  About half the men have 12 partners or less and some might have had only one partner in life.  Or even none.  So B’s mean is likely less than B’s median.  Now ladies – excuse me for this – but Ms. Kolata did raise the issue of prostitutes – as in a few women have lots and lots of partners, which would suggest the G’s mean exceeds its median.  </p>
<p>Now for you loyal husbands who could care less about this, hug your wife and tell you how terrific she is.  Even if both of you are “below average” by one silly measure.</p>

                                <p>Just in case you missed the tirade launched by Jim Cramer on the Federal Reserve, <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/08/the_mashup_youve_been_waiting.php">Matt Yglesias</a> brings us a humorous play on it.  Poor Jim, his speculative plays will not be bailed out by the FED.  But <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTU5ZmZkZWNkZTU2NTUwMjhhNGYwYjQyZjYyMDFmY2Q=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> is hoping Main Street will bail out Wall Street:</p>
<blockquote><p>Main Street was focused on the real economics of our nation. To this day, the American labor force is going to work, running the millions of small owner-operated companies that provide the wellspring of our prosperity. And Main Street is benefiting from an unprecedented global boom that is stocking our stores with affordable goods and creating plentiful new jobs as U.S. firms service the rise of new export markets. With a record 146 million men and women working, and the unemployment rate at a historically low 4.6 percent, the American labor force has increased its after-tax real income by a whopping $257 billion. Nominal wages for non-supervisory workers alone have sprouted by $296 billion over the past year, according to Wall Street economist David Malpass. Average compensation per hour has grown 5.2 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where to begin with Kudlow’s incessant stupidity?  Real wages for non-supervisory workers as of June 2007 were at the same level they were as of December 2002.  The employment to population ratio has declined from its 64.4 percent as of December 2006 to 64.0 percent.  The labor market is not quite as strong as Kudlow would have you believe.  </p>
<p>And I’m sure you are wondering about his claim that we are enjoying some sort of export boom.  If one compares the export to GDP ratio for 2007QII, which was 11.58 percent, to this ratio for 2000QIV, which was 11.21 percent – it does turn out that export growth has been slightly greater than GDP growth.  But average real GDP growth has been rather anemic over the past six and a half years.  Kudlow omits the fact that the import/GDP ratio has risen from 15.27 percent as of 2000QIV to 16.83 percent as of 2007QII.  To suggest that the U.S. is enjoying a net export boom, which is creating a lot of new jobs, is simply dishonest.  But hey – that’s Kudlow’s job: lie to the readers of the National Review.</p>
