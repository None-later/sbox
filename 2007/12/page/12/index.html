                                <p>Via <a rhef="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/12/this-is-a-banan.html">Andrew Sullivan</a>, an article in the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/06/america/06cia.php">International Herald Tribune</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Central Intelligence Agency in 2005 destroyed at least two videotapes documenting the interrogation of two Al Qaeda operatives in the agency&#8217;s custody, a step it took in the midst of Congressional and legal scrutiny about the CIA&#8217;s secret detention program, according to current and former government officials.</p>
<p>The videotapes showed agency operatives in 2002 subjecting terror suspects — including Abu Zubaydah, the first detainee in CIA custody — to severe interrogation techniques. They were destroyed in part because officers were concerned that tapes documenting controversial interrogation methods could expose agency officials to greater risk of legal jeopardy, several officials said. The CIA said today that the decision to destroy the tapes had been made &#8220;within the CIA itself,&#8221; and they were destroyed to protect the safety of undercover officers and because they no longer had intelligence value. The agency was headed at the time by Porter J. Goss. Through a spokeswoman, Goss declined this afternoon to comment on the destruction of the tapes.</p></blockquote>
<p>(I&#8217;ve italicized the same set of words Sullivan did.)</p>
<p>Sullivan notes this has happened before, and goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>This was a deliberate act to destroy evidence of war-crimes and to protect war criminals from facing the rule of law. </p></blockquote>
<p>And he asks &#8211; what defines a banana republic?</p>
<blockquote><p>How about an executive that ignores the rule of law, commits war-crimes and then destroys the actual evidence?</p></blockquote>
<p>Having spent a lot of time in military dictatorships, it sounds about right to me, though he is leaving out the bit where those in charge promote a martial attitude in the public, demonize those who don&#8217;t buy it, and help themselves to the public coffers.</p>

                                <p>A week ago, my sister, while traveling in Natal, a city in Northeastern Brazil, experienced some heart trouble.  Heart trouble is nothing new for her; she&#8217;s had a defibrillator in her for well over a decade now, and has undergone heart surgery a few times.  Long story short, a taxi driver rushed her to the hospital, and on Tuesday she underwent heart surgery.  Luckily for her, there&#8217;s a new <a href="http://www.hospitaldocoracao.com.br/">heart hospital</a> in Natal, so they knew what they&#8217;re doing.  It also allows her to compare care under specialists in the US (she&#8217;s been through this in LA, Houston, and North Carolina) to her care under specialists in a city most people have never heard of in Northeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>A few interesting facts:</p>
<p>1.  Needless to say, despite the plummeting value of the dollar relative to the Brazilian real, the cost of this surgery and everything related to the hospital stay is much, much cheaper in Brazil.  (Thank goodness &#8211; her insurance company will reimburse her for most of the expenses, but since it was done abroad, she has to pay for it first and submit a bill later.) <br />2.  My sister says that from her perspective, this surgery went more easily than the many surgeries she had in the US.  In plain English, the pain, upon awakening, was much, much less, and she was up and about much more quickly.  Whoever was in charge of sedation and anesthesia did one heck of a job.  (I should also note &#8211; this surgery was something of an emergency &#8211; I believe each time she&#8217;s had surgery in the US, they had time to plan and the surgery was scheduled months in advance.)<br />3.  The pre- and post- op care has been first rate.  My sister uses words like &#8220;fabulous&#8221; and &#8220;incredible&#8221; to describe how she&#8217;s been treated.  She&#8217;s talking about buying a place in Natal and moving there, and I suspect she&#8217;s only half joking.  Maybe less than half.</p>
<p>Health care is more expensive and often of lower quality in the US than in developing countries like Brazil, even when you&#8217;re dealing with exotic problems which is what American care supposedly excels at dealing with.  Someone tell me again about the greatness of the American medical system.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=14405&#038;R=11626F232"> article by Noemi Emory</a> of the Weekly Standard:</p>
<blockquote><p>Eagerly anticipating the defeat in Iraq to which they are so much attached, some on the left have also been preparing for another contingency: the assault that they think they see coming, a drive to pin the whole wretched failure on them.</p></blockquote>
<p> &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>If they had had their way, Iraq would still be the quagmire they are so fond of invoking, and the United States&#8211;or George W. Bush, which may be the more relevant factor&#8211;would have incurred a definitive and, at least in his case, legacy-blasting defeat. It is unfair of course to call this a stab in the back, as the Democrats have been engagingly open about their intentions. In the course of the past year, they have gone from attacking a plan that had not been effective to attacking one that hadn&#8217;t been tried yet, to attacking one that exceeded all expectations, while in the process ignoring reality, slandering a commanding general, and denying American forces in battle due credit for what they had done.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>When our tale opens, it is the last month of 2006&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait a second.  Is that when the tale opens?  And didn&#8217;t Noemi Emory write this article already?  Ah yes,  <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/002/672sdqvi.asp">here</a> it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>GIDDY WITH FAILURE, Democrats are breaking new ground in political strategy. Deep in a hole, they are digging still deeper. They have found a new method of dealing with setbacks: They find out what caused them, and do it again.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Then came the war and the worst of all happened: Democrats were drowned in a flood of good news. There were no wider wars, no more terrorist attacks, no strikes at Israel, no burning oil fields, no destructive Arab-street uprisings, no street-to-street fighting, and mercifully, very few deaths. After arguing that Iraq was a diversion from the war on terror, major al Qaeda figures were captured. After dismissing ties between Saddam and al Qaeda, links are now being uncovered. Even the Democrats&#8217; best worst hope&#8211;the looted museum&#8211;turned out to be useless. It was an inside job, it was unpreventable, and most of the missing artifacts have been found.</p></blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, its been a while.  The good news has given way to terrorist attacks,  street-to-street fighting, and a lot of deaths. Mostly of Iraqis so maybe that doesn&#8217;t matter all that much.</p>
<p>Major al Qaeda figures were captured&#8230; clearly, Emory hasn&#8217;t figured out the difference between al Qaeda and al Qaeda Iraq.  Its like many Middle Easterners who haven&#8217;t figured out the difference between an Israeli and a Jew, or between an American and a Canadian. </p>
<p>But enough of Emory for a moment.  I&#8217;m going to be honest here.  I hope there&#8217;s peace and quiet in Iraq.  I hope it comes today.  It would be nice to open up a newspaper a month from today and read that for 30 days, there have been no shootings or bombings against civilians or US or Iraqi forces in Iraq.  I hate hearing about people dying or fleeing their homes, and only coming back because the Syrians threw them out or they ran out of money even after prostituting their daughters in Jordan.  I hate US tax dollars wasted.   I want Iraq to be like Germany a month after VE day, or Japan a month after VJ day:  quiet and rebuilding.  I really don&#8217;t care if that makes Bush look good.  (I honestly doubt that would be enough at this point, but if it does, so what &#8211; how does eating crow compare to the degree of death and suffering we see regularly in Iraq?)   And I&#8217;d happily put up with the giddy strutting by the likes of Noemi Emory if we got that.</p>
<p>But what are the Noemi Emorys strutting around for?  Even if, by some miracle, there were peace and quiet tomorrow &#8211; what was it all for?  WMDs?  There were none.  Ties with al Qaeda?  Please.  To bring democracy to the Arab world and get rid of a source of instability?  We still don&#8217;t know whether democracy will happen, or whether Iraq will be a friend in the region.  But even if it comes to pass, wouldn&#8217;t both of these goals have been accomplished more easily and effectively by toppling the Saudi dictatorship?  Was what was accomplished, whatever it is that was accomplished, really worth the cost in blood and treasure to the Noemi Emorys of this world?</p>

<blockquote><p>Lives are at risk because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is woefully behind in the latest scientific advances and is under funded, a panel of advisers to the agency said at a public meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>Inadequate staffing, poor retention, out-of-date technology and a lack of resources mar the FDA&#8217;s ability, the report by a subcommittee of the agency&#8217;s Science Board said.</p>
<p>(A copy of the 60-page report, FDA Science and Mission at Risk, can be found at http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/briefing/2007-4329b_02_00_index.html.)</p>
<p>&#8220;FDA&#8217;s inability to keep up with scientific advances means that American lives are at risk,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>The panel, chaired by Gail Cassell, vice president for scientific affairs at Eli Lilly &#038; Co., and representatives from Genentech Inc and Wyeth, among others presented their findings to FDA Commissioner Andrew Von Eschenbach and other agency officials.</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone tell GW.  Another round of tax cuts would fix the problem.</p>

<blockquote>Yue Minjun, in his Beijing studio, surrounded by self-portraits.  Did he borrow, or did he lend?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&#038;ct=us/0x-0&#038;fp=4757684e5bc5c0c9&#038;ei=5LpXR6bQNJ6arAOn9s35CQ&#038;url=http%3A//online.wsj.com/article/SB119690586945915304.html%3Fmod%3Dgooglenews_wsj&#038;cid=1124247340">The Not Paulson Bailout</a> is discussed in the Wall Street Journal.  I’m ordinarily skeptical of editorials in the WSJ, but not today.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Mr. Paulson&#8217;s nonplan would allow states to float more tax-exempt bonds to refinance subprime borrowers. State housing authorities can now float tax-exempts to help first-time home buyers, but Treasury wants to let them float bonds to refinance loans or pay closing costs as well. This is clearly a taxpayer-financed bailout.”</p>
<p>On the other side of the political street, “Right on time, Hillary Clinton weighed in with the truly awful idea of freezing subprime mortgage rates for five years &#8212; presumably, through the end of her re-election campaign in 2012. She&#8217;d combine price controls and contract repudiation &#8212; an Argentina double.”   And some 62% of Americans oppose a mortgage bailout plan.  Reason is 95% of Americans are making their payments on time and don’t want their tax money used to assist the irresponsible.  (I’m firmly in that camp.)</p>
<p>Freezing rates may make people happy temporarily, but makeshift solutions that don’t bring down real estate prices prolonged the S&#038;L loan crisis in the 1980’s and ended in the deflationary spiral that devastated the Japanese banking industry.  And the likelihood of default is high, even if interest rates are frozen.</p>
<p>There are many incentives for reckless lenders to cut a private deal with reckless borrowers, not least of which is the cost of a default on a mortgage.  Some people will have to start renting an apartment, as they should have done while saving up a proper down payment in the first place.  Where is the shame in that?  Only in the minds of the haughty.</p>
<p>One lesson in all this mess is clearest of all:  That the American Dream, if it is limited to buying a house and spending lots of money, is a fragile dream. </p>
<p>My own version of the American Dream doesn’t involve buying anything.  It involves getting a good education, working hard, and having the same chance as anyone else to succeed or fail.  It means becoming a liker of people and a lover of great ideas and a traveler in the world.  It means seeking to participate in the arc of great events as life moves from birth to death.  To achieve any small part of this American Dream means more than what I own.</p>
<p>How about you?</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/23/2325?query=TOC">The New England Journal of Medicine</a> printed an article worth reading about possible impacts of childhood obesity. I like the attitude. Here is the last part:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Certainly, we have much to learn about the regulation of body weight. Low-fat diets have yielded disappointing results, and very-low-carbohydrate diets appear to be more effective only in the short term. Novel approaches that focus on the quality rather than the ratio of macronutrients appear promising, and other areas warrant study, including the effects of sleep deprivation, stress, infectious agents, and endocrine-disrupting environmental toxins on weight. Unfortunately, the U.S. government has thus far invested only a fraction of a cent in research for every dollar that obesity costs society. And although broad consensus exists regarding the dietary and lifestyle habits needed to prevent and treat childhood obesity, we lack anything resembling a comprehensive strategy for encouraging children to eat a healthful diet and engage in physical activity. Such a strategy would include legislation that regulates junk-food advertising, provides adequate funding for decent lunches and regular physical activities at school, restructures the farm-subsidies program to favor nutrient-dense rather than calorie-dense produce, and mandates insurance coverage for preventing and treating pediatric obesity.<br />Parents must take responsibility for their children&#8217;s welfare by providing high-quality food, limiting television viewing, and modeling a healthful lifestyle. But why should Mr. and Ms. G.&#8217;s efforts to protect their children from life-threatening illness be undermined by massive marketing campaigns from the manufacturers of junk food? Why are their children subjected to the temptation of such food in the school cafeteria and vending machines? Why don&#8217;t they have the opportunity to exercise their bodies during the school day? And why must Mr. and Ms. G. fight with their insurance company for reimbursement to cover the costs of their children&#8217;s care at the OWL clinic? Fortunately, with the exercise of both personal and social responsibility, we have the power to choose the shape of things to come.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Heritage foundation claimed poor people are not malnourished because they are fat and should eat beans and rice.<br />The Farm Bill includes funding for WIC and food stamps as well as big subsidies for corn sugar and other yummy nourishing things, and actually discourages medium and small farmers from thriving.</p>
<p>Add in marketing costs for fast food, that tornado of deception, and pit it against each parent one at a time. So much for the &#8216;fair food fight and solely each parents concern&#8217; idealogy &#8211; what a convenient frame. Another deferred cost from our big corporations and government. My supply of Twinkies has diminishing returns and exploding liabilities. Darn.</p>

                                <p>Illegal means criminal, and alien feels spooky. Are spooky alien criminals invading the country?</p>
<p>And the <a href="http://www.ailf.org/ipc/ipc_index.asp">The American Immigration Law Foundation</a> tells us the likely reason why not:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The problem of crime in the United States is not &#8217;caused&#8217; or even aggravated by immigrants, regardless of their legal status. This is hardly surprising since immigrants come to the United States to pursue economic and educational opportunities not available in their home countries and to build better lives for themselves and their families. As a result, they have little to gain and much to lose by breaking the law. Undocumented immigrants in particular have even more reason to not run afoul of the law given the risk of deportation that their lack of legal status entails.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.blogger.com/:" nid="104&#038;sid=">This Thanksgiving</a> an illegal saved a American boys life at the cost of deportation.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Cordova was taken into custody by the U.S. Border Patrol and agreed to return to his home in the Mexican state of Sonora without going through formal deportation proceedings.</p>
<p>Cordova came to the border again Tuesday, where officials from both countries held the ceremony in a U.S. Customs and Border Protection building at the Nogales port of entry. His mother, Almalida Soberanes, looked on proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did what he had to do,&#8221; Soberanes said. &#8220;He took care of that little boy and protected him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The district director for U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., said Cordova deserved the opportunity to come to America to work and that the congressman plans to introduce legislation that will let him get a special visa. Such legislation rarely passes, but Grijalva aide Ruben Reyes said it was the only way they knew of to show their thanks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds more like a good neighbor than a criminal. And if the Presidential candidates changed the name, they would have to deal with WTO GATS trade style failures with our neighbors.</p>
<p>And the positive side of spooky aliens goes unnoticed.  Who wants to be known as an exploiter of refugees?</p>
<p>The term means nothing as a useful stereotype on which to build policy, and hides the failure of nations doing the trade NAFTA-CAFTA thing.  How convenient for all.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>A number of well-known financial firms are now under investigation for mortgage practices, among them Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p>Guess what firm is not on the list? Pick the premier financial firm, the one with the most connections, the one that could be said to be the leading edge of “shock” capitalism. &#8220;Goldman Sachs,&#8221; you say? Yup, you got it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/business/05cnd-wall.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">Andrew Cuomo</a>, Attorney General of New York, is looking into how all this toxic waste was cleverly bundled in SIV’s, CDO’s….</p>
<p>Now read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/business/02every.html?ei=5087&#038;em=&#038;en=beda266cc5d7f690&#038;ex=1197003600&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;pagewanted=2&#038;adxnnlx=1196875887-EuB1U4Gspz75oHWmpjrOFw">Ben Stein’s little complaint</a> about Goldman Sachs. Goldman was aggressivly pushing the stuff even as it shorted it! How innovative of them!</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The point to bear in mind, as Mr. Sloan brilliant makes clear, is that as Goldman was peddling C.M.O.’s, it was also shorting the junk on a titanic scale through index sales—showing, at least to me, how horrible a product it believed it was selling.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as Merrill Lynch once pushed dot.com garbage precisely at the time its analysts were pronouncing it worthless, just as Merrill Lynch is suspected of again doing the same, so Goldman Sachs has done it on a far grander scale.</p>
<p>Now, I do not share Ben Klein’s philosophy—being of a far more liberal bent&#8212;but Ben, kudos…an honest conservative. No flies on you. Ben goes further in his complaint:</p>
<blockquote><p>HERE is a query, as we used to say in law school: Should Henry M. Paulson Jr., who formerly ran a firm that engaged in this kind of conduct, be serving as Treasury secretary?</p></blockquote>
<p>How does Goldman Sachs do it? Well, there is one answer: Connections work. It is not for naught that Goldman Sachs has sired Secretaries of the Treasury, advisors to Presidents, governors… Read this little primer of Goldman Sachs, appearing in none other than <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,197554,00.html">Foxnews</a>.</p>
<p>As the cheery Fox story puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think what it does is creates a very strong voice for the role of the worldwide capital marketplace,&#8221; Langevoort said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, my. And, the Fox writer tells us that these altruistic scions of the financial world have gone on to public service because they want to give something back to the world that has been so very generous to them. Why Paulson has given $100 million to an environmental fund! Now, you would think, that should warm my green little heart. It doesn&#8217;t. It is all a p.r. game.</p>
<p>Yes, Paulson is &#8220;green&#8221;; Paulson is in charge of how to rescue the world from the financial toxic waste his former employer diligently spread around the world. Paulson, it is, who replied to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/opinion/03krugman.html?hp">Krugman</a>, that perhaps financial innovation got ahead of regulation.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Paulson would not have it any other way. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/">Slippery slopes make slippery monsters</a>.</p>
<p>And when those monsters are those in charge, those who design the game, play it, win it, and then reset the board with perhaps different rules, then we know we are in trouble. Keep the money rolling. The board will be reset; new rules; new game&#8230;but really the old game in a different form.</p>
<p>Why isn&#8217;t Goldman Sachs on Cuomo&#8217;s agenda? Merrill Lynch is now an easy target, with its CEO now in disgrace with his golden parachute. Deutche Bank, too, is in trouble; so, too, is Morgan Stanley. <i>The rule is: If you lose money, then you are shark bait.</i> Goldman played the game much better: It kept the money rolling in.</p>
<p>Again, why is Goldman Sachs not on Cuomo&#8217;s agenda? Because, fuzzy little liberal that he is, Cuomo goes after only guys already hit, already money losers, whose p.r. is now tarnished. It is all part of the game. Besides, teddy bear Cuomo knows where the real power is&#8211;and he is not tangling with that monster.</p>
<p>If Cuomo does not add Goldman Sachs to his list, I put Cuomo right up there on the slippery monster dias with Paulson. Let&#8217;s call him &#8220;Igor.&#8221; Goldman Sachs is the premier lobbyist, the granddaddy of them all. Is it any wonder, as Stein implies, that conspiracy theories surround this god of lobbyists?</p>
<p>When will we ever have public servants that actually look after the public&#8217;s interest?</p>
