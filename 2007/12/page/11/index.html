<p>Pressure on Iran, a CNN on line headline.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Gates want to keep the pressure on Iran.</p>
<p>The US is already spending several trillion dollars to keep Iran from capitalizing on the vacuum we created in Iraq. </p>
<p>In te 1980&#8217;s we used Saddam to &#8220;contain&#8221; Iran. Then he became the threat du jour. Now it is back to Iran.</p>
<p>So, what kind of threat is Iran?</p>
<p>It has a GDP (wikipedia) of about $222B, mostly financed by selling oil. The closure of their nuclear program, at least their providing evidence that it is done with, shows they care about the oil business and not goring the customers or other suppliers. What sense is it for Iran to cut oil off? Their economy goes with the rest, as easily as they cut the flow some other player could cut their flow, too.</p>
<p>What is the issue if Iran gets half of Iraq&#8217;s oil production? </p>
<p>They increase their GDP by $50B and they get a bunch more people and structure to rebuild, we have not done much there.</p>
<p>The implied threat then is to Saudi Arabia&#8217; roylas, and the Gulf States Imirs. The GDP of the Emirates is around $168B (with Qatar add $53B) and Saudi Arabia $350B and to get to the Sunnis the Iranian army would have to go through hundreds of miles of desert and put up with a high tech military who should without US help smash their logistics and destroy whatever Iranian formations sally forth. </p>
<p>What threat is Iran?</p>
<p>Could Iran encourage Hezbollah in Saudi? In the Emirates? Could the Iranians do an insurgency in these places? If the Iranians were a threat and were meaningful they would already be doing the insurgency thing. No, these places are populated by Arabs, who happen to be Sunni who care for neither care to support Farsi speaking Persians nor broach Shi&#8217;a inroads.</p>
<p>Iran is no threat. But the false fear of Iran is a cause for trillions more in war machine waste.</p>

Ditto illegally monitoring US citizens.  </p>
<p>We have people talking about how both these things are very bad things, and we have other people talking about how both these things are very good things.  At least the people who tell us these things are very good things are being consistent.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Katherine Jean Lopez, editor of the NRO, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NmU4ZjkxNGVkMWZlMGIzZWZkYTM2NDZkYmM5NDQxY2I=">writes about the controversy</a> in which an NRO writer put up erroneous information about Hezbollah&#8217;s activities in Lebanon.  The writer of those posts has &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; left the organization.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked before, I&#8217;ll ask again&#8230; why is it a big deal that they would publish false information about a topic that probably will have zero effect on the lives of most of us, but not a big deal that they have for years published information about the US economy that is directly contradicted by primary sources, such as the White House&#8217;s Office of Management and Budget or the Bureau of Labor Statistics?  </p>
<p>An obvious example&#8230;  on the same day as Katherine Jean Lopez&#8217; article, here&#8217;s <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NmZlZjlhYTFjYTQ2YWViZmE3MmUzNWQzODE3NDhhNTQ=">Larry Kudlow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Americans are working. The 4.7 percent unemployment number remains at an historical low.</p></blockquote>
<p>It takes thirty seconds to find <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/lf/aat1.txt">unemployment figures</a> at the BLS.  Thirty seconds.  The BLS tells me that the annual unemployment rate in 2000 was 4%, and for the two years before that, it was under 4.7%.  Go back to 1969, and it was at  3.5% &#8211; more than a percentage point below Kudlow&#8217;s historical low.  In 1953, it was 2.9% &#8211; almost two points below Kudlow&#8217;s historical low.</p>
<p>This blog has pointed out such errors for years, and we&#8217;re not alone.  Have there been corrections?  Apologies?  Letters to the reader from Katherine Jean Lopez? </p>
<p>Which leads to questions&#8230; is the US economy so much more irrelevant to readers (and the people who kept the recent fuss going) than the number of Hezbollah people sitting in tents or deployed in a given neighborhood of Beirut?  And if not, is it National Review policy to misinform?  Do the folks at National Review &#8211; editors and other writers &#8211; not care about the accuracy of the information they put out?  Are they incapable of using search engines and checking?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to add&#8230;  we all make mistakes.  Regular readers are aware I know this better than most.  I recently had a doozy&#8230;  But at the first opportunity, as soon as I realized I had messed up, I put up a note (at the top and bottom of that post) indicating it was a mistake.  And we here at Angry Bear are just a small, amateur blog with no editors.  One expects better from a large, professional organization.</p>

<p>”Taking a break from money.  My dogs aren’t smart but they’re good dogs all the same.”</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1qQEr04KnI/AAAAAAAAA5w/KExsvUDRPXc/s1600-h/oldvet+-+dogs.gif"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1qQEr04KnI/AAAAAAAAA5w/KExsvUDRPXc/s320/oldvet+-+dogs.gif" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>George Graham Vest (1830–1904)</p>
<p>QUOTATION: “Gentlemen of the jury, the best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter whom he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us—those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name—may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it most.</p>
<p>A man’s reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolute, unselfish friend that man can have in this selfish world—the one that never deserts him, the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous—is his dog.”</p>
<p>“Gentlemen of the jury, a man’s dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he can be near his master’s side. He will kiss the hand that had no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains.</p>
<p>When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens. If fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his enemies. And when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the master in its embrace, and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death.“</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.com/2007/12/gop_senate_leader_mcconnell_appears_to_belittle_deaths_of_american_troops.php">TPM</a>, a link to the <a href="http://www.gcnewsgazette.com/articles/2007/12/06/local_news/news86.txt">Grayson County News-Gazette</a> of Kentucky quotes United States Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our brave soldiers have protected us for six years successfully. If we brought all of them home today (terrorists) they would be back here, so we need to stay the course. It&#8217;s gotten better and there is a dramatic decrease in causalities and we have begun to withdraw troops.” said McConnell. ”The polls are reflecting that there is a 15% increase in optimism in American&#8217;s views about the war.</p>
<p>“I won&#8217;t tell you everything is great in Iraq; it is not. But we want to keep a steady flow of funds so that we don&#8217;t disrupt the military,” said McConnell. “Unfortunately, most of our friends on the other isle are having a hard time admitting things are getting better; some days I almost think the critics of this war don&#8217;t want us to win. Nobody is happy about losing lives but remember these are not draftees, these are full-time professional soldiers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its better for professionals to get killed than draftees?  How much better?  And why?  Is it because we can save on pensions we&#8217;d otherwise have to pay professionals but don&#8217;t have to pay draftees?  Or does it have something to do with the professionals volunteering?  Is it still better if they were stop-lossed, or does it only apply to those who are there completely voluntarily?</p>
<p>If a non-Republican made a statement like this, imagine the field day McConnell and his fellow Republicans would have.</p>

                                <p>Has Lawrence Kudlow died or something?  OK, the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">payroll survey</a> showed an employment increase of only 92,000 but the household survey was another matter.  Our friend <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2007/12/#001033">Bill Polley noticed something</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But at the same time, the labor force participation rate climbed a bit last month, back up to 66.1% &#8211; where it was in July. The employment to population ratio is at 63% &#8211; also the same as its July level. These numbers had dipped a bit in recent months, so this could be a good sign that there still is some strength remaining under the surface.</p></blockquote>
<p>These figures were 65.9% and 62.7% last month.  As BLS noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>In November, total employment increased by 696,000 to 146.7 million.  The employment-population ratio rose by 0.3 percentage point to 63.0 percent; it was still below its most recent peak of 63.4 percent in December 2006.  The civilian labor force rose to 153.9 million over the month, and the labor force participation rate edged up to 66.1 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The increase from October to November reported  by the household survey usually gets Kudlow screaming from the rooftops that the payroll survey is not a reliable measure (never mind the fact that he was touting the payroll survey over the past few months when the figures from the household survey sort of sucked).  </p>
<p>My apologies to AB readers for being late today and thanks to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/employment-report.html">Spencer</a> for filling in. It seems I’m in NYC and I have to on occasion watch Kudlow and his cheap suits on CNBC where the natives are laughing at his serial stupidity even more than I do.  But there’s not a peep over at the Corner (NRO) and I’m afraid Larry must have fallen ill or something.</p>

<p>The employment report data continues to imply that the economy is slowly sliding into a<br />stagnation scenario.</p>
<p>I let others argue, but I do not see how one can avoid that conclusion.</p>

                                <p>Romney&#8217;s speech the other day, plus some scattered reports that God may be endorsing Huckabee this time around just like he endorsed GW in 2000, has me thinking about a very delicate question.   Its supposed to be, well, indelicate if not discriminatory, to take into a account a candidate&#8217;s religious beliefs when making a decision.  I don&#8217;t think that applies to atheism &#8211; we&#8217;re still allowed to not vote on them because of their beliefs.  And Muslims too, as well as folks who can&#8217;t figure out how to make their faiths distinguishable from Islam to the average American, like Hindus and Sikhs and, in many parts of the country, Jews.  I think its also acceptable to discriminate against pagans &#8211; they&#8217;re supposed to be anti-Christian anyway, and then there are Buddhists and&#8230;  </p>
<p>OK, so maybe we&#8217;re not supposed to discriminate among the various branches of Christianity, or at least we&#8217;re not supposed to discriminate against people who call themselves Christians.  </p>
<p>But what if they believe in something that every single one of us would agree is absolutely crazy?  What if a candidate calls him or herself Christian, but also espouses a view that Jesus came back as Elvis, has gone on hiatus, and will return in four years with an army of space aliens and Yetis to battle the Loch Ness Monster?  Presumably, it is acceptable to say aloud that we will vote against such a candidate for reasons of his/her belief alone.</p>
<p>But according to many branches of Christianity, the views of the LDS and other branches of Christianity are just as crazy.  What is the dividing line &#8211; at what point is it acceptable to say:  &#8220;Nope &#8211; what this person believes in is just too out there for him or her to get my vote&#8221;?  Is any view acceptable as long as it is sufficiently close to the majority belief?</p>

<p>
<blockquote>Ask Alberto Guimaraes about his vision for Brazil&#8217;s state-run oil company Petrobras in the United States, and he has a list ready:<br />More oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, more U.S. refining capacity, a bigger role in the domestic biofuels market and possibly even Petrobras-branded gas stations.<br />It may be just a matter of time before Guimaraes, head of Petrobras&#8217; U.S. arm in Houston, realizes the vision.<br />The South American oil giant is putting more emphasis than ever on the U.S. as part of an effort to expand its holdings outside Brazil.<br />Over the next five years, Petrobras plans to invest $4.9 billion in the United States. That&#8217;s 10 times the company&#8217;s five-year U.S. spending plan a decade ago, and accounts for about a third of what Petrobras will invest outside Brazil from 2008 to 2013.<br />&#8230;<br />Most of Petrobras&#8217; upcoming investment is aimed at developing oil fields in deep-water regions of the Gulf of Mexico, where the company has been snapping up acreage in recent years.<br />In February, the company started producing 20,000 barrels of oil per day at its first deep-water Gulf field, called Cottonwood. By 2013, Petrobras plans to raise output in the Gulf to as much as 150,000 barrels per day, Guimaraes said.<br />The boost will come largely from the addition of the Cascade and Chinook fields, 180 miles south of the Louisiana coast, where Petrobras expects to begin production by early 2010.<br />Petrobras, which will be the operator of both fields, owns 50 percent of Cascade and 67 percent of Chinook. Devon Energy, of Oklahoma City, owns the other half of Cascade, while France&#8217;s Total owns the rest of Chinook.<br />&#8230;<br />In a first for the Gulf, Petrobras will use floating production, storage and offloading, or FPSO, facilities to extract the oil and gas at Cascade and Chinook.<br />Unlike fixed platforms found in the Gulf today, which can be knocked off base in hurricanes, FPSOs can pull up stakes and move out of harm&#8217;s way with short notice. Offshore fields also can be brought online sooner with FPSOs, Guimaraes said.<br />The technology, a mainstay in Petrobras&#8217; Brazilian operations, could become a model for the rest of the industry in the Gulf.<br />The company, with partner Astra Holdings, is considering a plan to double the capacity of its 100,000-barrel-per-day U.S. refinery at the Houston Ship Channel. Petrobras owns 50 percent of the facility.<br />&#8230;<br />If costs are too high, however, the partners could decide on a less ambitious upgrade that would enable the plant to process heavier crudes, Guimaraes said.<br />&#8220;In my personal view, the only way we could decide not to go for the larger project would be if the costs are really, really much more expensive than the ones that we&#8217;ve estimated so far,&#8221; Guimaraes said.<br />Cost estimates for the larger expansion range from $2 billion to $2.4 billion, he said. A final decision on the project is expected by mid-2008.<br />In coming years, Petrobras aims to keep increasing its U.S. refining capacity, possibly by acquiring other plants, but only if the right opportunities arise, he said.<br />&#8230;<br />And Guimaraes said he hopes the company becomes highly involved in biofuels in the U.S.<br />Brazil is well-known for the development of sugar-cane-based ethanol, which powers many of the cars there. But the U.S. restricts imports of Brazilian ethanol through a 53-cent per gallon tariff.<br />Guimaraes called for a &#8220;phase down&#8221; of the tariff, and for the creation of a government and oil industry coalition to study the best ways to incorporate ethanol into U.S. fuels, as well as strategies for ensuring adequate ethanol supplies in the future.<br />&#8220;The ethanol industry in the United States should be a combination of local production, outside exporters bringing to the United States, and eventually an exchange between different markets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have to go in that direction.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Admittedly this company has a tiny footprint compared to the big guys, but worth watching as the Brazilians work their economy and the global markets.</p>
<p>I think we will find the subsidizing (tariff) of corn as a source for ethanol is unsustainable although currently favored by the candidates.  Corn as a source of fuel is for another post. I also wonder if they will provide some sort of real competition for the current monopoly as a spoiler.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2007/09/18/post_78.html?hpid=topnews">The Washington Post</a> has an interesting article on the derivation of health care plans that I was not aware of.</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of engaging in a debate on the merits of her proposal, the Republican candidates eagerly rushed to attack it as rampaging big government. It is one more example of why campaigns have left so many Americans disillusioned with the political process.<br />Romney above all others in the GOP field should have used more caution in the way he responded, given his own admirable record on health care in Massachusetts &#8212; a record that he has decided to run away from rather than embrace.<br />The reason Romney is more vulnerable in the way he responded is that, in broad strokes, what Clinton proposed on Monday bears a striking resemblance to the plan he proposed and then negotiated through the Massachusetts legislature when he was governor. The plan&#8217;s passage was one of the most acclaimed achievements of his term in office.<br />Both plans call for an individual mandate requiring everyone to purchase health insurance. Both feature subsidies to help low income families pay for that insurance. Both create pooling mechanisms to help make insurance more affordable. Both impose a tax on large companies that do not provide health insurance to their workers.<br />Clinton proposed no new government entities to administer the plan, although her aides acknowledge that some additional people would have to be hired within the existing bureaucratic structure to handle some aspects of it. The Massachusetts plan actually did create a new regulatory agency, although it is a fairly lean and not very costly addition to the state bureaucracy.<br />There are differences in some details of the two plans &#8212; the subsidies available for purchasing health care, the size of the tax on big companies that don&#8217;t offer insurance, the scope of the basic benefits package, the tax credits offered to small businesses to provide insurance. But as Jonathan Gruber, an economist at MIT, told me today, the two plans are &#8220;very, very similar.&#8221;<br />Gruber advised Romney as governor in the development of the Massachusetts plan and now is a member of a board overseeing its implementation. He said Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards consulted him as they were preparing their proposals this year.<br />Gruber said what Clinton proposed is far different from the plan that never came to a vote in Congress in 1994. He is dismayed by Romney&#8217;s response and what he called &#8220;misleading Republican rhetoric&#8221; to the Clinton plan.<br />&#8220;Romney deserves the credit for what he did in Massachusetts,&#8221; Gruber said. &#8220;He provided the intellectual leadership for much of what is going on. He should be basking in his glory and instead he&#8217;s running away from it, and I&#8217;m very disappointed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Who woulda thought? Maybe he is just shy.</p>
