                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Regular readers may recall a post I had not long ago where I three in the towel and removed Norton Anti-Virus from both my machine and my mother&#8217;s machine though we each had several months left on our subscription.  I had been a long time user of Norton &#8211; since long before it was bought by Symantec, but the package had made both my machine and my mother&#8217;s painfully slow to open files and to turn on.  I&#8217;m talking about ten minutes to boot up when you turn it on.  (I have a lot of memory, so that&#8217;s not the issue.)  Also, every so often, the computer would simply freeze up and stay that way until the machine was turned off, which then means sitting around waiting another ten minutes for it to boot up again.</p>
<p>I tried the CA product, which was offered for free by my ISP, AT&#038;T, found it to be adequate for my needs.  I also bought a copy for my mother so she&#8217;d be on the same package I am.  (She often has questions that are easiest to answer on the phone if we both have the same package.)</p>
<p>Recently AT&#038;T indicated to me it was time to update my anti-Virus package, so I hit OK, and next thing I knew, a) it uninstalled CA and b) it installed Norton.  It seems  now AT&#038;T is providing users with Norton.  Imagine my delight.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Update.</p>
<p>My life just went from bad to worse.  I installed the CA product.  Then I tried to delete Norton.  I went to add and remove programs and removed everything that said Norton or Symantec.  And yet, when I boot it up, there it sits!  The previous time it was easy to uninstall this thing.  According to the add/remove program, there is no Norton on my machine, yet it boots itself up and is sitting right there at the lower right of my toolbar, smugly slowing down my computer.  Anyone have any ideas how I can get this thing off of my machine?</p>

                                <p>Noni Mausa <a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/article/281499">looks at this story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A video that shows Vancouver police officers Tasering Robert Dziekanski has now been viewed by at least 15 million people online.  </p>
<p>The video and news of Dziekanski&#8217;s subsequent death caused an international outcry and spurred debate about the use of the electro-shock weapon. But despite the fact that police in Canada and the United States have been using them quietly – if not entirely without consequence – since 1999, few people actually know what Tasers are, how they work and why police and other agencies have them.  </p>
<p>Fewer still are aware, as human rights advocates claim, that the weapon – intended to replace firearms in life-threatening situations – is more frequently used for &#8220;pain compliance.&#8221; That&#8217;s a euphemism for inflicting pain to get someone to do what you want.  </p>
<p>The development of the Taser can be traced to a NASA researcher named Jack Cover who, in 1969, started to develop a non-lethal weapon that could be used by police to control unruly suspects &#8230; Cover surmised that a high-voltage, low-ampere electric shock would disorient and disarm someone long enough for police to assume control &#8230;  </p>
<p>By 1974, he had created a device that featured a powerful battery pack attached to two darts with long, insulated wires. A blast from the handheld device sent the sharp darts flying at a target.  </p>
<p>When the darts connected to an object – like a human body – it completed a circuit and sent a current of electricity through the object. That kind of shock can interrupt most people&#8217;s central nervous systems profoundly enough to render them helpless. It&#8217;s extremely painful. But, since the human body can&#8217;t store electricity, its effects are temporary.  </p>
<p>Cover named the weapon Thomas A. Swift&#8217;s Electric Rifle (or Taser) after his childhood hero, an adventurous youth from early 20th-century comic books.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>When the weapon was finally approved for police use in 1998 – starting with the Orlando, Fla., force – it was quickly accepted and arrived in Canada the following year.  </p>
<p>Modern Tasers deliver a 50,000-volt shock for five seconds and the darts can penetrate up to four centimetres of clothing as far as 11 metres [35 feet] away.  </p>
<p>In interviews, police on both sides of the border were unanimously and enthusiastically in favour of the Taser as an essential piece of equipment.  </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fact of life that police are sometimes confronted by desperate, violent individuals,&#8221; said one Ontario officer who didn&#8217;t want to be named. &#8220;And it&#8217;s a good feeling to know that you can stop that kind of person without resorting to deadly force.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Studies in major cities in the U.S. – Canadian ones don&#8217;t make such information public – have consistently shown that the addition of Tasers to a police force&#8217;s arsenal leads to a significant drop in shootings by officers. In 2003, two years after introducing Tasers, Seattle reported its first full year without a shooting by police in 25 years.  </p>
<p>But the problem is that while Tasers may be considered a non-lethal alternative to firearms, they can kill people..</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Amnesty International … advocates a suspension of the Taser until a definitive study can set rules for its application and to end the use of Tasers when they are not replacing deadly force.  </p>
<p>&#8220;They are just so effective and so easy to use,&#8221; [a spokesman] said. &#8220;They can easily be abused.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Buxton points out that Taser Inc.&#8217;s own literature admits that 20 per cent of Taser use is for pain compliance. The officer who didn&#8217;t want to be named admitted that was the case, but that he&#8217;d never done it himself.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Pain compliance is an unfortunate fact of life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t expect people who really don&#8217;t want to be arrested to do what you need them to do just because you ask them.&#8221;  </p></blockquote>
<p>Noni Mausa continues:</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>What interested me most about this article was the headline, presenting nonlethal pain as a &#8220;dark lure&#8221; to the police, wasn&#8217;t really explored very much in the body of the article.  However, this was something I wondered about Tasers since they came into common use.  It seems to me that not many police would shoot someone with a bullet just out of pure irritation &#8211;so messy, so noisy, so definite&#8211; however they might use a Taser, especially since it is touted as harmless and typically tested on the police themselves.</p>
<p>Similar is a new riot control weapon I keep hearing bits and pieces about &#8212; the one which can be beamed over a crowd like a flashlight and which causes a feeling as though the persons skin was burning.  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6297149.stm">Here&#8217;s</a> a pretty complete article from the BBC from last January:   </p>
<blockquote><p>The prototype weapon was demonstrated at the Moody Air Force Base in Georgia.  </p>
<p>A beam was fired from a large rectangular dish mounted on a Humvee vehicle.  </p>
<p>The beam has a reach of up to 500m (550 yds) [about a third of a mile], much further than existing non-lethal weapons like rubber bullets.  </p>
<p>It can penetrate clothes, suddenly heating up the skin of anyone in its path to 50C. [122 ºF]</p>
<p>But it penetrates the skin only to a tiny depth &#8211; enough to cause discomfort but no lasting harm, according to the military.   </p></blockquote>
<p>This device might only be used at first to disperse hostile crowds etc., as the article proposes, however I can&#8217;t imagine it would be more than days or weeks before it was used as a kind of large-scale community pain compliance device with a &#8220;dark lure&#8221; of its own.</p>
<p>Government use of waterboarding, which is presented as not much worse than a fraternity prank, Tasering, which is presented as painful but harmless, and this &#8220;heat ray&#8221; also being presented as painful but harmless all make the same ideological point: &#8220;Pure pain does not matter, except as it is useful to cow and control ordinary, dispensable people.  If it leaves no marks, then there is no real harm and (even better) no proof.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;dark lure&#8221; is the lure of power, threat, even casual spite, without accountability.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In his op-ed piece today, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/opinion/03krugman.html?hp"> Krugman</a> aptly sums up the financial mess that is now brewing, that refuses to go away.</p>
<blockquote><p>And free-market orthodoxy dies hard. Just a few weeks ago Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, admitted to Fortune magazine that financial innovation got ahead of regulation — but added, &#8220;I don’t think we’d want it the other way around.&#8221; Is that your final answer, Mr. Secretary?</p></blockquote>
<p>As our manufacturing sector continues <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/business/business-usa-economy-manufacturing.html"> to decline</a>, America&#8217;s die-hard version of free-market capitalism and financial wizardry can claim success in exporting its toxic waste now buried cleverly in tranches and commercial paper, in, as Krugman says, a marvelous alphabet soup: CDO, SIV, RMBS, ABCP.</p>
<p>The fear is: Have the greedy wizards this time undone themselves?</p>
<p>This writer has heard one scary story of a gentleman who tried to extract a medium size withdrawal from his sizable bank account. The cash was not readily available. What should have been a once easy wire transfer turned into a wrestling match. The main bank branch did not have the money; only a subsidiary branch at Walmart had enough cash on-hand.</p>
<p>Think of it: Walmart had the cash, but even Walmart would not cough it up without a fight. And, after it did, what did the wise Walmart manager tell our gentleman?</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly, I would not have an account anywhere of more than $100,000.&#8221; Yup. FDIC may have to trot to the rescue if this game worsens.</p>
<p>The Fed keeps pumping billions into the system, hoping to loosen up the logjam. No matter how clever the wizards are in packaging their goods, no matter how complicated and wonderful their calculus is, economics is finally quite simple: Money does not grow on trees. Hard work, real productive work, (manufacturing?) pays the dividends. Produce something; make something other than a piece of paper.</p>
<p>The wizards are nothing more than flim-flam artists, re-packaged versions of the old scam artists who sold the latest elixir to the local yokels.</p>
<p>Face it: I am pissed. Really pissed. Free, unregulated, markets are a scam.</p>
<p>Deregulation is just the slippery slope down which slippery monsters glide as they fleece us all. &#8220;I got a offer that is bound to make you rich,&#8221; they whisper. &#8220;In fact, you can actually buy insurance if you are worried!&#8221;</p>
<p>Re-read the Krugman quotation. Think carefully of Paulson&#8217;s answer. Paulson, now flush with billions in his own account, loves the system. Regulation should not anticipate or in anyway prohibit scams. Keep the dark corners available for innovation.</p>
<p>Think deeply about that. If a scam is made cleverly enough, complicated enough, opaque enough, then it is called &#8220;innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Krugman reports that poor Barnake had to be recently schooled in hedge funds. And if he had to be schooled, what about you and me? </p>
<p>Does <i>caveat emptor</i> really apply when one of the brightest among us, a PhD in economics, the chairman of the Fed, did not have a clue of what was happening? No <i>caveat emptor</i> arguments, please&#8230;unless you think you can explain the calculus in layman&#8217;s terms. And do not simply slur Barnake, unless you really think you know more than he does. Put the blame where it finally belongs.</p>
<p>In the olden days, such people, when discovered, were tarred and feathered, run out of town, or put in jail. A scam is a scam is a scam.</p>
<p>Ah, but the free marketers who hate regulations will say, &#8220;Hey! <i>Caveat emptor!</i>&#8221; Or, &#8220;Risk taking is the hallmark of American-style capitalism!&#8221;</p>
<p>Or, when the bubble crashes and the government has problems cleaning up the mess, they will surely scream, &#8220;See, the government failed you again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, you will hear all these arguments, especially the last one: &#8220;The government failed you.&#8221; That&#8217;s the one argument they want you to believe; they need you to believe if they are to be able to continue their clever shell games.</p>
<p>Think back to the fiasco of the toxic toys from China. Was Mattel really at fault? They were doing what they do best: Fleecing toddlers. As long as profits were high, Mattel did not give a hoot about the quality of its toys. Profits are the name of the game.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s to blame? Well, we all blamed those wily Chinese. Mattel blamed them; then apologized! Mattel knew who was really buttering its toast: China&#8211;low taxes, cheap labor, and no regulations. And the WTO gave its blessing. (Don&#8217;t you think it is about time that we really looked at the WTO? I have been singing that song for three years now. No one listens.)</p>
<p>Yes, finally, journalists discovered that our government did not have enough inspectors. Ah, they wisely concluded: it was OUR government&#8217;s fault! </p>
<p>But why were there few inspectors? The answer is simple; we have heard it preached endlessly since Reagan: Get the government out of business. Deregulate. Deregulate! Let those amazing entrepreneurs weave their wondrous webs. Sarbanes-Oxley? Ugh. Think about trade agreements? Ugh. Think about transparency in finance? Ugh.</p>
<p>And who really was the flim-flam artist in the toy game? Mattel, of course! They found the cheap labor and the country with no regulatory controls. Did this concern Mattel? Of course it didn’t. Precisely the opposite: It pleased them. Got them the money, honey.</p>
<p>But free marketers will cleverly rejoin: &#8220;Well, the market caught up with them.&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, I don’t buy that answer, not when my kids are at risk. And I certainly do not buy it when my bank account is at stake!</p>
<p>Now we have offshore hedge funs with which the banks have played footsy&#8211;not only banks, but pension funds and small and large municipalities&#8230;. And where was the Fed, where was our government? In the hands of the free marketers: Paulson, Greenspan, and company. They gave the newly minted loan sharks carte blanche. </p>
<p>Innovation, they called it. I call it greed, greed, greed&#8230;unregulated greed.</p>
<p>Slippery slopes make slippery monsters. If we do not get our government out of the hands of the corporate lobbyists, out of the hands of the free marketers, we will all be asking: &#8220;Who&#8217;s got the money, honey?&#8221; Better check your bank account.</p>

Worse, the erroneous and/or misleading information about economic issues affects the rest of us here, because many of that magazine&#8217;s readers endlessly repeat the tripe they read at that magazine, and vote accordingly. </p>

<blockquote><p>The American economy appears to have created far fewer jobs this spring than has been reported so far, a new government report indicated yesterday. That could provide further impetus for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates when it meets Dec. 11.</p>
<p>The report included a sharp downward revision of the government’s estimate of personal income growth for the second quarter. Because the changes were made as soon as better employment figures were available, the revisions made it seem likely that figures on job creation are also likely to be revised downward in coming months.</p>
<p>The new report concluded that personal income from wages and salaries grew at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second quarter, far below the 4.5 percent that had previously been estimated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, some of us have been wondering for a while whether the data on employment was making any sense for a while.  How long before the cheerleaders stop touting the fabulous job market situation?</p>

                                <p>This is the second of two posts sent to me this morning by readers with very big ideas.  This one is by OldVet&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>“Currency Values – time for a change?>/span><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1QDFb04KfI/AAAAAAAAA4w/qzl8efPKhbg/s1600-R/OldVet+-+Man+With+Money.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1QDFb04KfI/AAAAAAAAA4w/H2ItXA-pyDM/s320/OldVet+-+Man+With+Money.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />“Here, I have some US Dollars.  Can I leave the tip?”</p>
<p>As you may know, I’m personally agnostic on the value of the Dollar, except as it affects the real economy of the US .  The Bush administrations’ economic jokesters, led by Secretary of the Treasury Mr. Paulson, have a set of comedy routines.   The most entertaining routine could be described as the &#8220;falling dollar Not-My-Baby.&#8221; Bush and Paulson preach the all too familiar mantra “a strong dollar is in our national interest.”  I heard one high potentate of finance opine that nobody ever “devalued their way to prosperity.”  Oh, really?  Ever heard of China ?  How about OPEC, who effectively devalue their currencies by pricing Oil in Dollars (until recently.)  They addicted the whole world to their exports and got rich in the process. Who are you kidding, Washington ? </p>
<p>The US Dollar used to be a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/campaigns/eunion/cesterling.xml">small fraction</a> of the English Pound when Britain ruled the waves.  Now it takes only two Dollars to buy a Pound,  and during this time America became enormously prosperous.  So did Britain , whose currency lost relative value.</p>
<p>Which leads us the value of the Dollar.  We’ve run approximately 30 years of continuous trade deficits, meaning more consumption than production taking place.  We issue IOU’s by the bushel basket.  We claim that “deficits don’t matter” or that “deficits are a sign of economic strength.”  Here’s a different theory:  Deficits are paid for with borrowing, and that borrowing represents claims on US tax revenues and claims on hard assets in the US such as land or factories.  Continuous deficits are signs of an unhealthy addiction to the high life, and growing credit creation leads to a “Minsky Moment” which was the economist Minsky’s observation that credit expansions lead to excess and then collapse.</p>
<p>There is one avid group of traders and thinkers who believe that only the use of a “gold standard” as the basis for the US currency will stabilize trade deficits and credit creation.  Their idea is that the Fed and Treasury cannot create more Dollars than are warranted by our stock of gold in Fort Knox to back them up.  ( Russia has added massive amounts of Gold to its official government reserves.)  That is considered an absolute standard, such as we had till 1972 with the Breton Woods introduction of a floating currency regime in the world, such that governments no longer used Gold as their currency basis.  Then there was a modification called, informally, Breton Woods II.  Today we have massive one way trade imbalances between the US and much of the rest of the world.  That is especially true of the world which “pegs” or fixes in some manner their own currencies to the US dollar.  Like the GCC, China , and other countries officially, and via artificially low interest rates also Japan.</p>
<p>A modest proposition:  How about rather than an absolute standard like Gold to establish currency value, we use GDP and GDP growth rates?  Official monetary expansion would be limited to GDP growth and enough to cover inflation.  That would base our currency on our productivity, rather than our consumption or something dug out of the ground.  Or we insist that floating market rates determine the value of all currencies against the US dollar, to establish a market price; or no trade takes place until it does, or tariffs make up the difference in estimated value.  In other words, a little tough love.</p>
<p>How about a few other ideas to help out Washington?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This one was by OldVet.  </p>
<p>My very quick thought&#8230;  I&#8217;m a little confused about how this would work.  The gold standard worked because there was an underlying item&#8230; an ounce of gold.  GDP (or real GDP) is not something that can be bought or sold.  And the value of the dollar only makes sense in the context of &#8220;relative to other currencies.&#8221;  If other currencies are free to move against the dollar, is there really a peg?  </p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

                                <p>This morning I found two very far out proposals in my mail box.  Here&#8217;s the first of them.  It was written up at One Salient Oversight&#8217;s place, and with his permission, I&#8217;m reprinting the whole thing.  I don&#8217;t have time to insert the links, so if you want them, you&#8217;ll have to go <a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2007/12/zero-tax-economic-system.html">his site</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s his post&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Over the years I have come up with some crazy ideas and schemes. Every time I do, however, I discover that someone has been there first. I came up with the idea of a Democratic system of government that selects politicians randomly and without the need for political parties and elections, but then discovered that someone else had come up with it first. I invented the Zero Unemployment Economic System but then found out that I had simply come up with a Socialist version of Milton Friedman&#8217;s Negative Income Tax theory. As yet I have yet to find anyone advocating my idea for Absolute Price Stability before I did.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve come up with something else &#8211; the Zero Tax Economic System. It&#8217;s been running around in my mind for about 5-6 years now, but the reason why I never published anything about it was simply because I had no faith that it would work. To be honest with you, I&#8217;m still not certain that it would work, so if you do find holes in it I won&#8217;t get too embarrassed.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m publishing it now is due to some conversations I&#8217;ve had with a friend over the nature of the Monetary system and recent stuff I have read about SIMPOL and their ideas of monetary reform. As a result of my thinking through this, I have come to understand a bit more about Fractional-reserve Banking, as well as the Reserve requirement that has sometimes been used as part of a central bank&#8217;s Open market operations.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, here is my idea:</p>
<p>   1. All taxes are removed &#8211; income tax, sales tax, company tax&#8230; everything.<br />   2. The government creates the money it needs via seigniorage (printing money).<br />   3. The Central bank then controls inflation by increasing the Reserve requirement of bank deposits (on M2 and maybe M3).</p>
<p>Simple isn&#8217;t it? In years gone by it was my understanding that when a central bank intervened in the marketplace it either issued bonds or paid them back. I wasn&#8217;t really aware of the Reserve requirement &#8211; the percentage of deposits that banks must hold at the central bank &#8211; or any other tools of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Of course the idea of a government simply printing the money it needs without worrying about tax intake is hardly new. Everyone with a smidgeon of economic understanding knows that this sort of activity leads to the &#8220;H&#8221; word &#8211; Hyperinflation. Suddenly everyone then becomes an expert in the history of Weimar Germany (although Zimbabwe is another good place to start these days).</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m suggesting, though, won&#8217;t result in hyperinflation. This is because I still have faith in the ability of Monetary policy and Central banks to recognise inflation and to act accordingly (except, most saliently, the current US Federal Reserve Bank board, who obviously need Paul Volcker to be chairman again). The complete removal of all forms of taxation, followed by wholesale money creation, would inject massive amounts of money into the economy. But for every dollar, or pound or Euro or Yuan that is created, the central bank can remove by increasing the Reserve requirement for bank deposits. This balancing act will remove the hyperinflationary effect.</p>
<p>I can see three benefits of this system.</p>
<p>The first benefit is efficiency. Without the need to collect tax, entire government departments can be eliminated, removing the need for a massive bureaucracy to maintain the government&#8217;s tax revenue. Instead, the government simply gets the money created by the central bank. This efficiency would also be felt in the private sector, with no tax accountants and lawyers required by companies and corporations. Obviously some level of unemployment would occur as accountants and lawyers and bean counters look for work, but that would be easily solved over time. With less time spent on adhering to tax laws and finding loopholes, the economy will benefit.</p>
<p>The second benefit is that government revenue is indirectly raised from the broadest possible base. This proposed system does not really create money from nothing &#8211; the raising of the Reserve requirement of bank deposits balances out the seigniorage. This means, in effect, that the tax burden is still there &#8211; it&#8217;s just that it has transferred into the marketplace in the form of higher market interest rates, which affects the entire economy.</p>
<p>The third benefit of this system is that it accommodates those who wish for &#8220;small&#8221; government as well as those who want the government to have a larger role in the economy. Obviously the amount of money the government spends will determine how high the reserve requirement of bank deposits becomes &#8211; the smaller the government, the lower the reserve requirement will be and the larger the place the free market has; the larger the government, the higher the reserve requirement will be and the free market will have a smaller place in the overall economy. Put simply, this zero-tax economic system can work for both conservative and progressive sides of politics. In the end, the argument between these two political sides will no longer be about government revenue and taxation, but government spending and market interest rates.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve had other economic ideas, how would this idea fit in with my other models &#8211; the Zero Unemployment Economic System (ZUES) and Absolute Price Stability?</p>
<p>With ZUES, all that would happen is that each employed person would continue to receive two incomes &#8211; one income from his/her employer (which has no minimum wage requirements) and the universal income from the government that all people would receive equally (which is a form of negative income tax). But rather than this universal income being sourced from higher levels of tax revenue, the income is merely created by seigniorage, with the amount determined by formula. The central bank then modifies the Reserve requirement to control inflation.</p>
<p>With Absolute Price Stability, the Central bank would set the Reserve requirement at such a level as to keep inflation at zero. Moreover, I would argue that banks should not get any interest paid at all on these reserves by the central bank which, in a zero-inflation environment, means that banks would neither directly gain nor directly lose from having to keep money under the central bank bed.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>This one was by One Salient Oversight.   Its early and I&#8217;m on the run, so I don&#8217;t have time to give it the treatment it deserves.  A few random thoughts:</p>
<p>1.  Government spending in 2006 was over 20% of GDP.  Can that be funded simply by printing money?  And if not, can government spending could be shrunk enough for it to be funded entirely this way?<br />2.  Fiddling with the money multiplier does affect the money supply (and hence, inflation), but its small potatoes relative to open market operations (the Fed buying and selling bonds).  Will it be enough?<br />3.  Banks make their money by loaning out money.  One Salient Oversight&#8217;s plan wouldn&#8217;t necessarily create funds out of thin air &#8211; some of those funds would come from reduced profits that the current system creates (out of thin air) for the banks.  Will the banks agree to it?   And if not, can they be forced into it?  After all, banks are powerful enough, politically, to get bail outs when they do incredibly stupid things?<br />4.  As much as they say they&#8217;re for tax simplification, I just don&#8217;t see the big accounting and tax law firms agreeing to something like this, and they&#8217;re pretty powerful entities too.</p>
<p>Anyway, your thoughts?</p>

                                <p>There really isn&#8217;t much of a way to enforce arms control treaties&#8230; except by maintaining goodwill among the nations that sign them. If one party gets a reputation for breaking or pulling out of treaties, eventually the other party realizes there isn&#8217;t much benefit to not doing the same. All you need is one bad actor <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/01/MNDDTM7PH.DTL">and it all falls apart</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Vladimir Putin signed a law Friday suspending Russia&#8217;s participation in a major conventional arms treaty that had limited NATO and Russian military deployments in Europe.</p>
<p>The Kremlin had been threatening all year to scrap the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe treaty, and on Friday, Putin signed a law passed this month by parliament providing for that step. The suspension takes effect Dec. 12.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Signed in the last days of the Cold War, the arms accord limited the number of tanks, combat aircraft and attack helicopters, as well as artillery pieces and other heavy weapons, that NATO and Russia could deploy in Western Europe and the western part of Russia.</p></blockquote>
<p> <strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The United States, the European Union and NATO all had urged Russia not to suspend the treaty, which was regarded in Western Europe as a cornerstone agreement for maintaining security on the continent.</p>
<p>&#8220;NATO regrets this decision,&#8221; NATO spokesman James Appathurai said in a statement. &#8220;We hope that the Russian Federation will not take any unilateral actions that undermine the integrity of the treaty. Allies are looking forward to discussing the issue at the upcoming NATO-Russia Council meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Kremlin had previously linked suspension to U.S. plans to deploy a missile defense system in Eastern Europe. The United States says the system is intended as defense against a potential threat from Iran, but Russia fears it will be used to peer into its airspace. Russian officials have not been assuaged by U.S. proposals designed to alleviate those concerns.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>My elderly mother flew to Kansas in November to spend some time with my brother.</p>
<p>She flew back the day after her birthday, so her Ohio driver&#8217;s license was expired by 1 day.</p>
<p>An eagle-eyed employee of TSA spotted her faulty ID, she was pulled out of line and given the &#8220;maybe she is a terrorist treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>My mother does have an extensive criminal record (well, a speeding ticket in 1958 anyway). She looks pretty dangerous, well, only when she has her crochet hooks.</p>
<p>According to the TSA Inspector General, if she been carrying bomb parts they would have probably left her alone.</p>
<p>Do any of you feel safer,  knowing that old ladies are being rousted?</p>

                                <p>Tyler Cowen has an interesting article on the weak dollar in the Times today that is also discussed at economistsview.</p>
<p>Just so everyone would have a good view of imports market share I though I would publish this chart.</p>
<p>Discussion on the dollar often center on the impact of a weak dollar on imports.  But this chart raises the question of how much the currency matters.  Maybe the strength of the domestic economy is much more important then the dollar on this issue.  Just something to think about.</p>
