                                                                    </div>

                                <p>China&#8217;s entry on the world stage has been dramatic. All eyes turn to it. And well they should. How China goes, so goes the world. China is moving rapidly from an agrarian to an industrial society, with hopes of joining the digital and information society&#8211;and capturing the industrial base along the way. I have deep reservations on whether its goals are achievable. China’s attempt to meet them has profound implications for all of us.</p>
<p>To understand what is happening, we must look not only at its short-term strategy but also at its long-term goals. To this end, each year China publishes &#8220;China&#8217;s Modernization Report.&#8221; A good but awkward translated summary of China&#8217;s approach can be found <a href="http://www.modernization.com.cn/cmr2005%20overview.htm">here</a>. The Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS) prepared this summary and was instrumental in the preparations of all the reports.</p>
<p>Note: I make extensive use of the 2005 report.</p>
<p>For an entry page to all the reports—with the exception of the 2007 report, go <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&#038;sl=zh-CN&#038;u=http://www.modernization.com.cn/book.htm&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=translate&#038;resnum=4&#038;ct=result&#038;prev=/search%3Fq%3DChina%2B%2522Modernization%2Breport%2522%26hl%3Den">here</a>.</p>
<p>An elaborate theory of how to modernize underpins China’s timetables and goals, the birth of which began with Walter Rostow of the Johnson administration [classical theory of modernization]. Classical theory describes the appropriate path from an agrarian to an industrial society.</p>
<p>The classical theory has since been extended, modified, and developed by other theoreticians, most notably Professor He Chuanqi, of China. It is called the “Comprehensive Economic and Modernization Theory, describing the path from an industrial to post-industrial society, a society based on information and knowledge.</p>
<p>Each year, China carefully measures its progress against 131 countries, each of which is in a different state of development. For China, modernization is a competition, replete with charts, indices, and other measurements in a wide variety of areas. We are all in a race, an important point to make. China’s challenge is not military in scope, but profoundly economic. To think otherwise, is to make a serious mistake.</p>
<p>For China, modernization is a science. Because it is a science, operating on laws similar to physics, there is a path that of necessity must be followed. I have a couple of reservations here:
<ol>
<li>Modernization theoreticians deal primarily with the past, how particular countries succeeded, etc. The past may not be prologue of what is to come. More importantly, how countries developed in the past may be no longer applicable or even possible given the facts of global warming, resource depletion, population growth, and pollution. Should China develop as the U.S. and England did in the early 19th and 20th centuries, replete with pollution and smoke stacks? We all remember the Victorian industrial horrors Dickens described. If I were China, I would try to leapfrog into 21st century technology. But clearly, China has chosen the old—and very dangerous—path.</p>
</li>
<li>While the information and digital revolution will quicken, of necessity another revolution may be coming into play: Sustainable development, which may require China to think carefully about its concept of perpetual growth.
</li>
<li>China accepts the principles of globalization. I have deep reservations that the principles of the WTO can be sustained in the face of global warming and resource depletion. Something is going to give. And it will not be nature.</li>
</ol>
<p>Resource depletion needs further elaboration. I speak here not only of depletion of material resources—oil, water, some metals, etc—but also of biological resources connected with food. Bioengineering is in its infancy, a revolution in itself. As we deplete the natural environment of its life—fish, for example—and as we struggle to make plant and animal life more amenable to our growing needs, we are using the principles of privatization to embark on a very dangerous bio-genetic path: neutered salmon, seedless seeds, pigs with the hides of cows, chickens with no brooding instinct, etc. Are we prepared to completely refashion the natural world precisely at the time when are facing monumental challenges? I leave it at that. What path will China take in terms of resource depletion?</p>
<p>To return to the topic at hand: China’s goals. Below are some of the mile markers it intends to achieve:</p>
<p>2020: Mature industrialization, complete the transition from undeveloped to developed country. By this time, China will be the world’s factory.</p>
<p>2030: Begin transition from industrial to post-industrial, i.e., knowledge and digital based economy.</p>
<p>2040: Start-up period for post-industrial.</p>
<p>2050: Developing period for post-industrial. Should be among top 40 countries in the world. Eighty per cent urbanization will be complete. In short, 500 million rural people will be moved into industrial cities. Everyone will have access to social services.</p>
<blockquote><p>If all the tasks above are all-roundly fulfilled, Chinese society will become a moderate developed society by 2050. Its average life expectancy will exceed 80 years old; the penetration rate of university, and the rate of urbanization and informatization will exceed 80%; the coverage rate of pension insurance, medical insurance and unemployment insurance will reach 100%; the free and rational flows of people will be realized, and the rate of tourist going abroad will exceed 50%; the minimum month wage will exceed US$1,300 (in 2002 dollars), and the proportions of absolute poverty (incidence of international high poverty and medium poverty) and child labor will be reduced down to zero…</p></blockquote>
<p>2080: Fully developed country.</p>
<p>2100: “Frontier” country, ranked among the top 10 countries.</p>
<p>Look carefully at the goals for 2050. According to one <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2006/02/13/2003292885">commentary</a>, China must continue its 9% GDP growth to meet these objectives. China has the metal to the pedal; continued rapid growth is part of the plan. The commentary continues:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>He Chuanqi, who headed the research team, told local reporters that China’s economic situation is 100 years behind the U.S. and there is only a 6 per cent chance of his forecasts being realized. </p></blockquote>
<p>There is a six per cent chance of minimum wage being $1,300/month, $15,600/year, $7.50/hour—all measured in 2002 dollars? What about inflation? What should our minimum wage be by then? For those who think that globalization a la China will raise all wages—including U.S. wages—think again. All boats are not going up here. We have the classic “race to the bottom.”</p>
<p>Because of social services, no one, the report contends, will have to depend on minimum wage.</p>
<p>Certainly, by 2050, U.S. social services will be in a nosedive. Have modernization theoreticians accounted for the collapse of our social net? I don’t think so. Is this part of modernization theory? China considers the U.S. to be the top “frontier” nation, the nation against whom all others are measured; the one China wants to be by 2100. Well, we are in trouble.</p>
<p>We are the advance guard of the digital revolution, the knowledge revolution, and de-industrialization. But globalization and de-industrialization have pushed us—as it will China—into strange waters. Our safety net is now imperiled. Wealth disparity here is increasing. Does modernization theory account for this as well? I don’t think so. If China follows our path, it has a rude awakening.</p>
<p>China’s theoreticians are no different from our own: Both see globalization <i>as practiced</i> as a desirable path. Each has used past history as a description of how to proceed. What neither sees is that another path is needed. In the 21st century we are faced with problems never before encountered, problems that demand unique solutions.</p>
<p>Another <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-01/30/content_5674710.htm">commentary</a> starts to describe the problem:<br />
<blockquote>Though its author insisted on this possibility, the public did not buy it, citing the country’s widening wealth gap.<br />This time [the 2007 report], the experts who compiled the report, have been much wiser to tap into the public’s growing worries about the country’s deteriorating environment and regional disparity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ahead, lies global warming, environmental pollution, and depletion of resources. The world is pursuing globalization in a fashion that does nothing but accelerate our coming problems. Privatization of everything under the sun, from genetic codes to rainwater, is not a solution.</p>
<p>In my opinion, China has no chance whatsoever of successfully completing its present course. Set aside for a moment whether a country can continue 9% growth for 40 years. Set aside for a moment whether a country of China’s size can properly balance its urban and agrarian societies; whether it can move “500 million rural home dwellers into cities”; whether it can then move “600 million city dwellers into suburbia.”</p>
<p>Set aside for a moment the impact that China’s vast, impoverished labor market will have on the rest of the world. By 2050, China wants cars for half its population. Ask only: Has China properly accounted for global warming, environmental decay, and depletion of resources? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>In my next piece, I will consider one small facet of China’s challenge: the glaciers that feed its rivers.</p>
<p>Addendum&#8211;Breaking News According to <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/climate_change/article2483839.ece">Fatih Birol</a>,IEA chief economist, China will surpass the U.S. in CO2 emission <i>in 2007</i>. Previously, no one thought China would garner this dubious distinction until 2010. It is imperative that China develop properly and successfully. (Hat tip to Movie Guy.)</p>

                                <p><a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2007/04/what_are_you_go.html">David Altig</a> gives me too much credit – as well as some well deserved blame for the heat in the free trade debate.  He then adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>In simple terms, there are losers, but the winners can win enough to more than match those losses.  All would be well with the world if the winners and losers could be easily identified, and an appropriate compensation scheme implemented.</p></blockquote>
<p>I doubt many would disagree with this premise.  My position, which I think is Dani Rodrik’s, is that without compensation, there are losers.  Mind you – I’m a free trade advocate.  I just wish we’d pay more attention to the appropriate compensation schemes.  </p>
<p>We should also thank Kash for <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/which-trade-model-is-better.html">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rather than work from the question that needs to be answered, Mankiw seems to be comparing them based on which model is less unrealistic (after all, we must acknowledge that both models are &#8211; by design &#8211; grossly unrealistic). Since economic models are not meant to be at all realistic, but rather are intended to help teach us through analogy, I find Mankiw&#8217;s answer unsatisfying. When I teach international trade theory, my students find that the Ricardian model is the simplest and easiest-to-grasp illustration of the answer to one big question:can international trade leave both countries better off? The Ricardian model makes it easy to see that the answer is yes, which is what the model was designed to show, and is the single best thing about it.  But I don&#8217;t really think that that is the only important &#8211; or even most important &#8211; question asked about trade policy today. Instead, trade policy now is at least as concerned with much more subtle questions like what specific form(s) will the gains from trade take if we pursue trade policy xyz?, or who will gain and who will lose from trade policy xyz?  For better or worse (and I think it&#8217;s probably for the better), trade policy today must have as a crucial component some consideration for the distribution of the benefits of trade, and not just be concerned with whether trade liberalization will make some aggregate measure of US economic activity go up or down. These concerns are vitally important for moral, economic, and political reasons, and must be addressed when it comes to the creation of trade policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The distributional aspects of trade policy WAS what Dani Rodrik was addressing.  I’m delighted to see that David Altig is on the same page as the rest of us – apparently including Greg Mankiw who tells me that he never said there were no losers from free trade.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/04/does_free_trade.html">Tyler Cowen</a> adds dynamic gains from increased exports:</p>
<blockquote><p>More empirically, having your export prices bid up is a wonderful driver of growth more than it is a distributional or efficiency nightmare.  The net externalities of that process are usually positive rather than negative, even without firm- or industry-level increasing returns in the traditional sense.  The exports help build a middle class and in the long run make democracy and rule of law possible.  The dynamic effects are the key to the benefits of trade, and neither the Ricardian nor the Heckscher-Ohlin model is satisfactory.  The best simple (ha!) model has trade bringing more innovation, new goods with high consumer surplus, greater reason to work hard and get ahead, greater domestic inequality, a growing middle class, and new and usually more liberal political coalitions.</p></blockquote>
<p>But is this a case for free trade? <a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/04/on_the_dynamic_.html">Dani Rodrik</a> notes the same dynamic argument has been by trade protectionists:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the reason the excerpt made me jump is the similarity it has to arguments that proponents of import substitution often make in support of trade protection. After all, if you believe higher prices for your industries are good for all kind of dynamic and political effects, why not apply the same reasoning to your import-competing industries as well &#8211; especially if they are the only industries you have (your exports being dominated by traditional commodities).</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/horsesmouth/2007/04/washington_post_3.php">Josh Marshall</a> notes that recently the Washington Post sent out an e-mail to various pundits and political types asking them whether Harry Reid was right about the war being lost. Today, Marshall notes that the Washington Post<br /><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/27/AR2007042702046.html">provides the results</a> of its little, unscientific survey.</p>
<p>The tally: 5 ayes, 4 nayes.</p>
<p>Marshall helpfully lists the ayes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8212; Barbara K. Bodine, a former ambassador and a coordinatorfor post-conflict reconstruction for Baghdad and central Iraq in 2003 <br />&#8212; Paul R. Pillar, former deputy chief, CIA Counterterrorist Center</p>
<p>&#8212; Bruce Hoffman, Georgetown University; adviser, Iraq Study Group</p>
<p>&#8212; Robert Dallek, presidential historian</p>
<p>&#8212; Nathaniel Fick, former Marine infantry officer in Afghanistan and Iraq</p></blockquote>
<p>The four nays: Paul Rieckhoff, Frederick Kagan, Stephen Hadley, and Victor Davis Hanson. The first nay was an Army platoon leader in Baghdad in 2003-2004, and he actually uses the words &#8220;not yet.&#8221; Not exactly the vote of confidence. As to the rest, they&#8217;re the architect of the surge, one of its chief peddlers, and the NRO/Hoover dude who styles himself a military historian.</p>
<p>The Washington Post also provides a quote from each. This is what Hanson wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The war is not lost &#8212; no more than it was in winter 1776, July 1864, December 1945 or November 1950. The challenge is winning back hearts and minds at home, rather than in Iraq, where brave thousands join us each day to fight an evil sort the likes of which we haven&#8217;t seen in recent memory.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m sold. If a military historian who thinks that the low points in the Revolutionary War came a few months after the Declaration of Independence, the low point in Civil War came (as one of Marshall&#8217;s commentators notes) when &#8220;Grant laid siege to Petersburg and Sherman was packing his bags for Atlanta&#8221;, and the low point in World War 2 came a third of a year after the Japanese surrendered, well, who am I to argue?</p>
<p>All snark aside &#8211; unless the Washington Post mangled the quote, this is more than Hanson just being wrong, as he habitually is. This is Hanson having limited knowledge of the basics of his field. I would reckon that 99% of the readers of this blog know that WW2 was over by Winter 1945, and this isn&#8217;t a blog for historians. How do people like that continue to be quoted and respected? How does he even stay employed?</p>

<blockquote><p>In a troubling sign for the American-financed rebuilding program in Iraq, inspectors for a federal oversight agency have found that in a sampling of eight projects that the United States had declared successes, seven were no longer operating as designed because of plumbing and electrical failures, lack of proper maintenance, apparent looting and expensive equipment that lay idle.</p>
<p>The United States has previously admitted, sometimes under pressure from federal inspectors, that some of its reconstruction projects have been abandoned, delayed or poorly constructed. But this is the first time inspectors have found that projects officially declared a success — in some cases, as little as six months before the latest inspections — were no longer working properly.</p>
<p>At the airport, crucially important for the functioning of the country, inspectors found that while $11.8 million had been spent on new electrical generators, $8.6 million worth were no longer functioning.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>The dates when the projects were completed and deemed successful ranged from six months to almost a year and a half before the latest inspections. But those inspections found numerous instances of power generators that no longer operated; sewage systems that had clogged and overflowed, damaging sections of buildings; electrical systems that had been jury-rigged or stripped of components; floors that had buckled; concrete that had crumbled; and expensive equipment that was simply not in use.</p>
<p>Curiously, most of the problems seemed unrelated to sabotage stemming from Iraq’s parlous security situation, but instead were the product of poor initial construction, petty looting, a lack of any maintenance and simple neglect.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s what makes it even more troubling:</p>
<blockquote><p>Officials at the oversight agency, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, said they had made an effort to sample different regions and various types of projects, but that they were constrained from taking a true random sample in part because many projects were in areas too unsafe to visit. So, they said, the initial set of eight projects — which cost a total of about $150 million — cannot be seen as a true statistical measure of the thousands of projects in the roughly $30 billion American rebuilding program. </p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, seven out of eight failures is the win rate in the parts of the country that are considered relatively safe. Put another way &#8211; these outcomes are due primarily to shoddy workmanship by contractors and incompetence by the locals. Imagine what things must be like in those (not so few) parts of the country where violence is an added problem.</p>

                                <p>As we were <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/can-free-trade-raise-prices.html">applauding</a> <a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/04/does_free_trade.html">Dani Rodrik</a>, <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/04/does-free-trade-lower-prices.html">Greg Mankiw</a> was defending the <a href="http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/003282.html">Dan Drezner</a> lower prices from free trade benefits everyone fallacy.  Greg starts where we ended – that free trade helps the export sector:</p>
<blockquote><p>Defenders of free trade rarely are in a position of having to defend exports, because people think that exports create jobs. When people complain about trade, it usually about the alleged job-destroying effect of imports. This partial-equilibrium complaint naturally encourages a partial-equilibrium retort: imports lower prices for consumers. The losses to producers in these markets are more than offset by gains to consumers from lower prices. True, the full story can only be told in general equilibrium, where it is relative prices that matter for the allocation of resources.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Dani WAS talking about the general equilibrium model.  But let me turn the microphone back to <a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/04/can_the_wrong_a.html">Dani</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can the wrong answer in the classroom be the right answer in public debate? I don’t think so, but it looks like we may be disagreeing with Greg Mankiw here &#8230; Now, neither of Greg’s arguments is exactly right. On his first point, there is no theorem that guarantees that the partial-equilibrium losses to import-competing producers “are more than offset by gains to consumers from lower prices.” My wheat-and-beef example in Argentina is exactly an instance where this supposition fails. And on his second, trade theory does not guarantee that real wages of workers rise as a result of free trade, as Stolper and Samuelson showed long ago. (Greg knows this of course, which is why he qualifies his statement by referring to the basic Ricardian model, which is a highly special model where labor is the only factor of production and gains from trade have to show up as higher real wages.) But the real reason for this post is different. I want to take issue with the general philosophy behind Greg’s argument, which is that a less than full (and possibly misleading) story in support of your argument is OK as long as it helps disarm your opponents in public debate.  His position seems to be this: Look, these anti-trade guys don’t understand comparative advantage anyhow, and it is pointless to waste our breath trying to explain it to them. So let’s instead argue our case in “their” language and within “their” framework. Never mind that Professor Greg Mankiw would flunk us if we ever gave the same answer in Ec. 10.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/04/on_the_other_ha.html">Mark Thoma</a> helps pull together elements of this blog debate including <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/04/on_the_other_ha.html#Krugman">this</a> from Paul Krugman:</p>
<blockquote><p>I thought the whole &#8220;but prices are lower&#8221; answer was killed 65 years ago by Stolper and Samuelson.</p></blockquote>
<p>It was so why is Greg Mankiw still holding onto the fantasy that trade can make everyone better off without some form of compensation for those whose real income is reduced by a movement towards freer trade.  His answer is strategic simplification.  Strategic?  Simplifying matters for public policy standards is fine – but to suggest no one loses from free trade is simply incorrect.  They do teach Stopler-Samuelson at Harvard – don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/04/ricardo-vs-heckscher-ohlin.html">Greg Mankiw</a> does consider Stopler-Samuelson via the Heckscher-Ohlin model then tosses in the capital mobility argument.  But as various smart folks weigh in – including Paul Krugman – capital mobility alone does not get us back to the simple Ricardian model that Greg tends to lean on.</p>
<p>But I have another problem with Greg Mankiw’s dismissal of the various theorems that come out of the Heckscher-Ohlin model.  One of them is the <a href="http://internationalecon.com/Trade/Tch60/T60-14.php">Factor Price Equalization</a> theorem:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fourth major theorem that arises out of the Heckscher-Ohlin model is called the factor-price equalization theorem. Simply stated the theorem says that when the prices of the output goods are equalized between countries as they move to free trade, then the prices of the factors (capital and labor) will also be equalized between countries. This implies that free trade will equalize the wages of workers and the rents earned on capital throughout the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, free trade in goods accomplishes the same results as factor mobility.  If we posit a capital abundant nation where wages are higher than wages in other nations but the returns to capital are lower.  Free trade or factor mobility will raise the return to capital in this nation but also lower wages.  OK, the real world is more complicated that what is envisioned in the Heckscher-Ohlin model, but it is also more complicated that what is envisioned in the Ricardian model as well.  So how do these real world complications lead Greg Mankiw to his claim that movements towards free trade benefit everyone?  His latest formulation doesn’t quite answer this question.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: Greg Mankiw provides a comment here that he never said there were no losers from free trade.  But he did write:</p>
<blockquote><p>This partial-equilibrium complaint naturally encourages a partial-equilibrium retort: imports lower prices for consumers. The losses to producers in these markets are more than offset by gains to consumers from lower prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which prompted this from Dani Rodrik:</p>
<blockquote><p>On his first point, there is no theorem that guarantees that the partial-equilibrium losses to import-competing producers “are more than offset by gains to consumers from lower prices.” My wheat-and-beef example in Argentina is exactly an instance where this supposition fails.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Greg is now agreeing with Dani – great!  But then what was this debate about in the first place?</p>

                                <p>So the DOW reached 13120.94 at the close of this week, which puts it 11.92% higher than its 11722.98 peak in January 2000.  By contrast, consumer prices have increased by about 22.75% over the past 7.25 years.  In other words, in January 2000 dollars, the DOW reached 10689.26 or 8.8% below its record real level.  But that didn’t stop <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/apr2007/pi20070427_117538.htm">Business Week</a> from saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Dow Jones industrial average finished the week at another record high … The stock market has considerable buying power despite numerous skeptics, says S&#038;P.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/stock-market-highs-and-economic-growth.html">Kash</a> reminds us of a Business Week article back in June 25, 1990:</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember the adage &#8220;Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me&#8221;? That explains why, even with the Dow Jones industrial average above 2900, stock market investors are far more jaded than jubilant. In the summers of 1987 and &#8217;89, the market took big strides and scored new highs &#8211; only to get clobbered in the fall. So those already in stocks are wondering if it&#8217;s time to get out, and many on the sidelines are afraid to come in, for fear they&#8217;ll be fooled yet again. But the timid might be the ones who get fooled this time around. The Dow is on a roll. After setting a new record of 2935 on June 4, the market made a quick retreat to 2862, only to come bounding up again.</p></blockquote>
<p>This jubilation was just before the start of the 1990 recession.  I hope we don’t have a repeat of that episode, which is why I’m hoping the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates.</p>

                                <p>I guess it&#8217;s not giving away too much to say that when the job that pays the bills is finished for the day, my 2nd job is as an elected councilmember for a small suburban town in the Pacific Northwest.  Believing as I do in the power of government, properly applied, to improve the lives of its citizens, I am frustrated at the sheer number of cows placed on the tracks ahead of the problem solving train.  Housing is today&#8217;s topic, beloveds.  Help me sort it out.</p>
<p>Last week I attended an affordable housing strategy workshop with other elected officials from the region, housing and social service providers, and developers.  We were asked to rate 47 different potential strategies for increasing the number of affordable housing units (at all levels), within several different categories, such as creation and use of a housing fund, public/private partnership options, and land use incentives.</p>
<p>The discussion lasted for four hours.  What struck me most about the options we were given to consider was that the groups asked to pay for providing housing almost always ended up being the taxpayer and/or homeowner.  </p>
<p>For instance, a tax on developers who convert rental units to condos would be folded in to the condo purchase price.  Loan guarantees for affordable housing projects would be backed by tax receipts.  A voted-on bond issue or levy would hit taxpayers directly.  And so on, and so on.  An affordable housing tax on businesses who employ folks at less than a living wage, &#8220;the Walmart tax&#8221;, didn&#8217;t get much support, and understandably so since it would likely also hit small businesses that can&#8217;t afford to pay a living wage and stay in business.</p>
<p>The only group not asked to sacrifice in one way or another to provide affordable housing was the developers.  They need to be &#8220;incented&#8221; to build low cost housing.  We were told we needed to make it &#8220;worth their while&#8221; to do so.  Expedited permitting, building fee permit waivers, expedited permit processing, using Federal or State grant programs to make the developer &#8220;whole&#8221;.</p>
<p>This seems an awful lot of effort to go through to tease developers so they will grace us with affordable housing.  Perhaps I&#8217;m just naive, but it seems to me there has to be a better and more direct way to achieve this goal.  </p>
<p>Thoughts, students?</p>

<p>He also quotes a Cal Thomas column from the same period:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the Berlin Wall fell and Eastern Europe escaped from the shackles of communism, I wrote that we must not forget the enablers, apologists and other &#8220;fellow travelers&#8221; who helped sustain communism&#8217;s grip on a sizable portion of humanity for much of the 20th century. I suggested that a &#8220;cultural war crimes tribunal&#8221; be convened, at which people from academia, the media, government and the clergy who were wrong in their assessment of communism would be forced to confront their mistakes. While not wishing to deprive anyone of his or her right to be wrong, it wouldn&#8217;t hurt for these people to be held accountable. <br />That advice was not taken &#8211; but today we are presented with another opportunity in the form of scores of false media prophets who predicted disaster should the U.S. military confront and seek to oust the murderous regime of Saddam Hussein. The purpose of a cultural war crimes tribunal would be to remind the public of journalism&#8217;s many mistakes, as well as the errors of certain politicians and retired generals, and allow it to properly judge their words the next time they feel the urge to prophesy&#8230;</p>
<p>All of the printed and voiced prophecies should be saved in an archive. When these false prophets again appear, they can be reminded of the error of their previous ways and at least be offered an opportunity to recant and repent.</p></blockquote>
<p>I note that there&#8217;s a strong overlap between the folks who predicted the death of the economy in the wake of the Clinton&#8217;s tax rate hikes, a brilliant economy and booming surplus following GW&#8217;s tax rate cuts, and those who have been cheerleading the war. Its not a perfect overlap, but the correlation is probably well over 70%. </p>
<p>And I note that these people have been wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong about everything. But they suffer no consequences. None. GW? Dick Cheney? Paul Wolfowitz? Condi Rice? Bill Kristol? Bill O&#8217;Reilly? Rush Limbaugh? Achmed Chalabi? Glenn Reynolds? Michelle Malkin? None of these people paid any price at all. (Rumsfeld paid a price &#8211; but it took three years, and someone had to be the goat.) </p>
<p>In fact, most of these people are busy today treating naysayers as if they&#8217;re scum. They&#8217;re impugning the patriotism of people who disagree with them, who say: &#8220;Enough is enough. You&#8217;ve caused enough damage. Its time to stop this nonsense before it gets even worse.&#8221; </p>
<p>Imagine what they&#8217;d be like if they&#8217;d been correct. About anything.</p>
<p>People should be free to disagree about things in a democracy. And we all make mistakes.  But how can there be any hope for discourse if debate is dominated by those who are always wrong, and who lord their failures over everyone else?</p>

                                <p>You may have heard that <a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/04/does_free_trade.html">Dani Rodrik</a> has his own blog.  This entry makes an important point about the debate over free trade:</p>
<blockquote><p>Advocates of globalization love to argue that free trade lowers prices, and the argument seems sensible enough. Think of all the cheap goods from China that we can buy at Wal-Mart.  But anyone who understands comparative advantage knows that free trade affects relative prices, not the price level (the latter being the province of macro and monetary factors).  When a country opens up to trade (or liberalizes its trade), it is the relative price of imports that comes down; by necessity, the relative prices of its exports must go up!  Consumers are better off to the extent that their consumption basket is weighted towards importables, but we cannot always rely on this to be the case. Consider your typical Argentinian for example, who consumes a lot of wheat and beef. Since these are export products for Argentina, free trade implies a rise in the relative price of the Argentine consumption basket. (The gains from trade are still there, of course, but they derive from the usual allocative efficiency improvements, not from lower prices across the board.) And in the U.S., the Wal-Mart effect has to be qualified to take into account the fact that the relative price of the goods that the U.S. exports (including for example agricultural commodities) is higher than it would have been absent trade.  Similarly, when the U.S. gets better market access abroad for its agricultural exports (a key demand under the Doha round), you can be sure that this will raise domestic prices for these goods, not lower them.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the rare occasion when President Bush’s rhetoric actually makes sense, he alludes to the gains from free trade in terms of increased demand for U.S. exporters such as our agricultural sector.  Increased demand leads to higher income for those American suppliers in these sectors even though it also means I’ll likely have to pay a bit more for their products when I visit my local <a href="http://www.ralphs.com/homepage/index.htm">Ralphs</a>.</p>

                                <p>Not that I’m purchasing the product nor that I’m happy that production is up, but our friend Mark Thoma emailed my a link to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/24/AR2007042401508.html">this story</a>.  Antonio Maria Costa writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Annual demand for opium is approximately 4,500 tons. Last year a record 6,100 tons were produced in Afghanistan alone. That country&#8217;s production is 30 percent more than total world demand. Heroin prices should, in theory, be plummeting. But they are not. So what is going on? Does opium defy the laws of economics? Yet prices seem to be resilient. The (unweighted) national average price of dry opium at the farm gate in Afghanistan is dropping, but not significantly &#8211; it was $125 per kilo in December 2006 compared with $150 per kilo a year earlier. Prices differ across the country, not surprisingly, since Afghanistan is not a unified territory or market, even for opium. But overall, the drop in prices is modest when compared with the massive increase in opium production, 50 percent, in 2006.</p></blockquote>
<p>Time out. When Costa says annual demand = 4500 tons, I presume he is referring to some quantity demand = quantity supplied market clearing solution at a price say of $150 per kilo.  So what he is saying that is the market clearing equilibrium quantity increased by just over 35% as the price fell by almost 17% &#8211; not that quantity supplied exceeds quantity demand by 30%.  If the elasticity of demand were around two, this would all make perfect sense (OK, I’ve assumed away any change in the demand schedule).  So why is Mr. Costa looking for some non-standard explanation of the data he cites?  OK, I don’t know what the elasticity of demand for opium is or whether there has been a shift of the demand schedule or whether some of the elaborate explanations offered by Mr. Costa have some factual basis – but apparently he doesn’t either.</p>
