<p>Someone is angling to be kicked off the Corner.  And at a corner of the internet a lot more closely associated with facts, <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10423.html">Steve Benen</a> has a story about how the troops are no longer a reliably enthusiastic audience for their esteemed Commander in Chief.  Benen notes that even such right wing newspapers as the Washington Times are now willing to report facts like this.</p>
<p>I was wondering though&#8230;  what&#8217;s been the tipping point that has made it acceptable <br />to doubt the Decider?</p>

<p>Well, its nice to see corporate profits are high, but I wonder where they&#8217;re going.  But I don&#8217;t think it surprises anyone that things aren&#8217;t so good for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Note&#8230; I don&#8217;t see how they did it, so take it with a grain of salt.  But the figures seem to match what I know of what&#8217;s going on, so I&#8217;m willing to give EPI the benefit of the doubt.</p>

                                <p>It is good to see that <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/04/economic-iololationists-win-one.html">Greg Mankiw</a> argues that these tariffs are bad policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>You might expect me, as a former economic advisor to President Bush, to defend these policy moves by the administration. If so, you&#8217;d be wrong.  Industrial subsidies are bad policy, but they are bad policy for the country paying for the subsidy. The country buying the subsidized goods benefits from cheaper imports. Think of these subsidies as the opposite of OPEC&#8211;another country conspires to sell goods below competitive prices. For the same reason that high prices from a cartel hurt us, low prices from a subsidy help us. It is common sense that when you buy something, you would rather pay less than more for it. That is as true for a nation as it is for a household. The bottom line: The Chinese taxpayers should be complaining about these subsidies, not the American government.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said!  The free traders at the <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTIzM2JhMTNjZDJjYmE0MzIzODk4OTQxZjIxN2YxYTU=">National Review</a> do not blame President Bush:</p>
<blockquote><p>The timing of the Commerce Department’s decision late last week to impose tariffs on paper imports from China was no accident. It came just days before the U.S. Trade Representative’s office announced the completion of a U.S.–South Korea free-trade agreement. In order to build congressional support for that deal and other upcoming trade legislation, the administration had to do something big to show U.S. manufacturers that it takes their concerns about China seriously. Unfortunately, the move brings the United States perilously close to the edge of a trade war with China that would have devastating consequences for American consumers.</p></blockquote>
<p>You see – it’s those Congressional Democrats who are to blame for Bush’s decision to impose tariffs according to the Bush cheerleaders at the National Review.  Of course, there are two problems with this garbage from the National Review – both of them being pointed out by <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/us-korea-free-trade-agreement.html">Kash</a>.  One is that the opposition to free trade has bipartisan elements just as there is bipartisan support for free trade.  The other comes here:</p>
<blockquote><p>As usual, however, any controversy over this agreement will probably be blown considerably out of proportion. On the one hand, passage of the agreeement would probably have no real measurable impact on the US labor market, since tariff rates are already low, wage differentials are relatively small, and Korea is so small (relative to the US economy). But on the other hand, passage of the agreement would probably also have almost no measurable benefit for consumers in the US, for exactly the same reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>We imported almost $300 billion in goods from China last year and less than $50 billion in goods from South Korea.  And yet the National Review thinks having protection with a nation as large as China is a decent trade-off for reducing protection with a nation the size of South Korea!  Go figure.</p>

                                <p>At <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/04/can_marginal_ut.html">Marginal Revolution</a>, comments on a story in <a href="http://www.neuron.org/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS089662730700181X">Neuron</a> magazine.</p>
<blockquote><p>Reporting in the current issue of Neuron, the scientists reveal that when a small sum of money is on the line, poorer people learn quickly how to maximize their profits, leaving their wealthier counterparts in the dust.</p>
<p>In a Pavlovian paradigm, a number of abstract shapes flashed in front of 14 participants. After each shape appeared for three seconds, a picture of either a 20-pence coin (roughly 40 cents) or a scrambled image followed. A card of one particular shape was always followed by the coin, and subjects were told that they could take a 20-pence piece home if they could accurately predict when the money card was the next one up&#8230;.</p>
<p>The poorer people tended to figure out which card signaled money ahead within about 12 trials&#8230; whereas the richer people took about 35 trials.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m reminded of a post I once wrote about <br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/recent-of-history-of-south-america-and.html">land reform and Marxism in South America</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Early on in the settlement of Brazil, the king of Portugal, Dom Joao III, created a number of hereditary &#8220;captaincies&#8221; &#8211; enormous land grants the size of states today. Needless to say, the captains who got these captaincies were extremely wealthy, well-connected individuals. Also needless to say, someone who is given a property the size of, say, Oregon, isn&#8217;t going to care too much about developing that property. That person&#8217;s major source of wealth is not developing property, its making nice to the king who can give him more property. </p>
<p>Now, consider the captaincy. In every single case, there were already people living there at the time the land was granted. In many instances, natives (who would soon be virtually wiped out), but also European settlers. Many were criminals or just the random dregs of society, while others were hoping to make a quick buck and go back to Europe wealthy.</p>
<p>Regardless, the vast majority of Brazilians were living on what, legally (assuming the Portuguese government had right to decide what was legal) living on land owned by others who had little interest in that land. And its not like there was anyplace else to go&#8230; the Portuguese split of the lands under their domain, the Spanish did the same to the lands under their domain, ditto the Dutch, and whoever else was jostling around in South America.</p>
<p>So what do you do? Well, say you, as a settler goes and builds something. If it produces wealth, the landholder will express some interest. So your incentive is either not to build anything, or build on the sly, in the boondocks. If you get too big, too successful, someone else &#8211; the captain or his descendents, would simply take your stuff away. (And those of you who are ready to argue that &#8211; &#8220;No, that&#8217;s irrational. The captain&#8217;s best interests are served by encouraging small businessmen to create a thriving economy on his property&#8221; forget that doing that takes effort and foresight, but simply seizing provides a benefit here and now, especially to someone born of enough privilege.) </p></blockquote>
<p>Update&#8230;  I&#8217;m also reminded of my thoughts on the estate tax.  I consider myself a capitalist, but I feel where possible, everyone should have a fair shot.  (Put another way, I&#8217;d like to see equal starting points, not equal outcomes.  I think outcomes should truly depend on work and talent and skill, not, say, who one&#8217;s parents are.)  </p>
<p>One more thought&#8230;  doesn&#8217;t the experiment show that, all else equal, having fewer resources makes one make better decisions about how to allocate one&#8217;s resources.  Does that mean a  very high estate tax is efficient?</p>
<p>Update.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/04/scientific_amer.html">Mark Thoma</a> looks at claims that this study says something about Marginal Utility across individuals.</p>

Some random questions:</p>
<p>For libertarians:<br />1.  At what point does a person’s right to do what they choose get over-ridden by the fact that they have serious mental illnesses?  <br />2.  If society has a right to lock up such a person because they might, for instance, harm a child at the library can we lock up a CEO of a company that is emitting pollution that definitely causes harm to thousands of children?</p>
<p>For the tax cutting crowd (including libertarians):<br />1.  For those who don’t like paying taxes because those taxes might inadvertently benefit other people, who benefits when folks who are a danger not just to themselves but to others are out on the streets?  Might the benefits of giving such people proper care, or if we’re too stingy for that, at least warehousing them away from children and access to items that could be used as weapons be worth the costs?<br />2.  If you don’t think society should pay for the costs associated with treating these folks, who should?  And who should be responsible for the damage the mentally ill cause, if not to themselves than to others? <br />3.  Is Reagan largely responsible for the current situation?  If so, did he do right or did he do bad?</p>
<p>For folks that are slightly left of center (like me, and I assume many readers of this blog):<br />1.  How much care is enough for folks with mental illness?  Should society offer more care to those who can become productive?<br />2.  What’s the best way to take care of this problem for all involved, including the mentally ill folks?</p>

                                <p>Jonah Goldberg had a <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MDc3ZjYxNzgxZmI4NzMwYmE3YzQ4ODc4YTIyMWQ5ODU=">short post</a> at the Corner today that read as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>ABC had a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=3001578">reported that</a> on its moderate success so far. Also, the Baghdad <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/world/20070404-121156-4055r.htm">reported that</a>. </p></blockquote>
<p>With luck, things will actually improve, for once.  But the bit about the curfew had me curious.  So I followed the link (to a Washington Times story) and read this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Iraqis say several neighborhoods have improved since the security plan went into operation almost eight weeks ago, an appraisal reflected in pushing back the start of the nightly curfew to 10 p.m.</p></blockquote>
<p>How bad can things be if the touted improvement is pushing back a nightly curfew to 10 p.m.?</p>

<p></em><br />Sebastian reminds me of a topic that I have meant to address.</p>
<p>In the past three decades and the next three decades ten of millions of Americans are internally migrating to the southeast and southwest, and millions more external immigrants will settle there. So says the Census Bureau.</p>
<p>This hurts the rustbelt and the northeast perhaps, but that topic is for another time.</p>
<p>Here is the question:</p>
<p>What happens when we move ten of millions of people to areas where there are either chronic water shortage (the entire southwest) or major environmental impacts from development (Florida) and water shortages, and the supply systems start to go  dry?</p>
<p>Both of these problems are already underway, and there is only the occasional media buzz, and certainly no serious policy discussion on restricting development (try Google if you doubt me).</p>
<p>The Colorado River is likely to be the scene of the first large scale battles, skirmishes have already broken out pitting ranchers versus townies(some of my family were Dustbowl Okies, and we know about water shortages and drought).</p>
<p>So, when Vegas has 5 million people and very little water, what happens next?</p>
<p>Someone will suggest a pipeline to the Great Lakes, which is probably not practical and certainly not environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>I know that addressing public policy issues in a 30 or 40 year time span is not easy, and is especially tough for politicians, but this problem is not going away.</p>
<p>And your thoughts…….?</p>
<p>PS: When I wrote this last evening I did not know what would be on the front page of the New York Times today – honest.</p>

                                <p>Reader Ole Keynesian continues his transformation into the Everyday Economist:</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>The Everyday Economist and the Coupon Theory of Economic Growth</strong></p>
<p>Last weekend, Mrs. Everyday Economist commented that the number of grocery coupons in the Sunday paper has been increasing over the last few months. &#8220;The economy must be in trouble&#8221;, Mrs. E.E. said. &#8220;I can tell when times are good, because the coupons dry up&#8221;. </p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; the most recent issue of Business Week <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_15/b4029036.htm">reported that</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>In January, revolving credit, made up largely of credit-card debt, was up $52.7 billion, or 6.4% from a year ago. Consumers haven&#8217;t racked up revolving debt at such a clip since late 2001. And the pace looks set to quicken in February. A large chunk of the $6.8 billion increase expected by economists likely will be in the form of new credit-card debt, as nonrevolving credit probably cooled off with slower auto sales.</p>
<p>The timing of the acceleration in revolving credit suggests consumers are turning to their credit cards as a partial replacement for reduced mortgage equity withdrawal, says Goldman Sachs senior economist Ed McKelvey. According to his calculations, increases in revolving credit have offset about 20% of the decline in cash-out refinancing or increased home-equity lines of credit since late 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>So combining Mrs. E.E&#8217;s observation with Business Week&#8217;s, should we draw the conclusion that consumers are accumulating more credit card debt in part because it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to finance current Grape Nuts spending by tapping home equity?</p>

                                <p>Well, Save the Rust Belt inspired me to make my first, self posted posting. </p>
<p>Save the Rust Belt appears to be asking for help in his posting about the downturn of Michigan and Ohio.  So, I thought this is a good post to jump on to start a line of solutions as oppose to just looking at data and trends.  Let&#8217;s put that knowledge to work on his question: is there anything anyone can do, &#8230;?</p>
<p>I answer:  Yes, there are things that could be done.  But it means reversing years of rhetoric about what the purpose of an economy and a government are.  I mean, what is a company&#8217;s only purpose, only reason to exist?<br />Is an economy truly an entity unto it&#8217;s self?<br />Is government us or not?<br />Who or what is serving whom here?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start.  Lets produce policies that reverses the rise of income to the top 1%.  Letting them have all that money has not caused the economy to grow any faster than in the past.  It certainly is not being turned into investment in this country in an amount equal to their acquisition.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll take it back to 1981 the beginning of St. Reagan.  From 21.83% (2005) to 10.02%.  Using BEA&#8217;s table 2.1 total national personal income and Saez-Piketty&#8217;s data we free up $1209.27 billion in 2005.  That leaves 1025.97 billion to the top 1%.  Or $2.578 million to each of the 397, 900 tax units that make up the 1%.  Using the labor force for 12/05, that gives $8055.73 dollars to all those potential workers.</p>
<p>To much you say?  We&#8217;re being to hard on the top?  Ok, how about we go to the end of St. Reagan&#8217;s time and let them have 14.49%?  We free up 751.56 billion and leave them with 1483.66 billion or $3.728 million each.  This gives those potential workers another $5006.52.  I&#8217;ll even be progressive in this top 1% being that the average income goes from $370,887 for the top 1% to $695,764 for the top 0.5% to $2,316,353 for the top 0.1% to $14,027,614 for the top 0.01%.  </p>
<p>Remember, these are numbers just for 2005. </p>
<p>So, there is the money.  Now, how do we want to get this extra $5K to $8K each to the labor force?   I assume it will not all be give as a direct payment.  Anyone?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2162755">Mickey Kaus</a> must have fallen from the trickle down line about a rising tide lifting all boats:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not denying income inequality is rising &#8211; I wrote a book based on the reality that income inequality is rising&#8211;or that Bush-era prosperity, in particular, hasn&#8217;t been as widely shared as prosperity in other eras. My suggestion is only that if you keep the economy going and stop new immigrant entrants from flooding in at the bottom, entry-level wages will eventually rise and people will start complaining (as they did in the late 1990s) about the &#8220;U-shaped&#8221; economy in which the rich and the poor were gaining faster than the middle</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_04/011058.php">Kevin Drum</a> says the evidence does not support what Kaus said.  Kevin wants us to look at the real income of families in the bottom fifth of the population as documented in <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f03ar.html">this table</a>.  Kevin argues that the income for the poorest of us has been flat for 30 years “through good times and bad”.  He continues with:</p>
<blockquote><p>How long is it supposed to take for an economic expansion to turn into a tight labor market? Over the past three decades, the only time the median wage has increased significantly was during the late 90s, and that was thanks to the most intense, highest-flying bubble in a generation. We can&#8217;t count on that happening again any time soon.  I&#8217;m as big a fan of a hot economy as the next person, but the stubborn fact is that economic growth over the past three decades has produced next to no gains for the average worker. And even if it did, what&#8217;s the magic key to manufacturing an endless expansion? None that I know of.  There&#8217;s a Nobel Prize waiting for the guy who can figure out how to do away with the business cycle.  I happen to think that median wage stagnation has gone on long enough that it&#8217;s plainly a serious problem and plainly something that needs to be addressed via policy. For some reason, the free market has disconnected wage gains from productivity gains in recent years, and there&#8217;s no indication that this is going to change on its own.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, our graph does not show that this series is exactly flat even if real income in 2005 was about the same as real income way back in 1978.  But if Kevin’s point is that a go-go economy is not a sufficient condition for reducing poverty, he’s exactly right.  It is true that most people’s income tends to rise during upswings in the business cycle, while most people’s real income tends to decline during recessions.  But as Kevin notes – business cycles come and go.  Yes, real income of the very poor fell during the double-dip 1980 and 1982 recessions.  But even with the recovery during the 1980’s, real income never reached what it had been in 1979 until we saw the Clinton boom.  And even as we are supposedly back to full employment now, real income of the very poor in 2005 is far below what it was in 2000.  </p>
<p>Rightwingers lover to state the War On Poverty has been a failure.  It’s not a favor no more than the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan to rout the Taliban and Al Qaeda was a failure.  But if you stop fighting a war to divert resources elsewhere (the Iraq War or tax cuts for the very rich), then it’s not exactly a recipe for continued success.  Our success at reducing poverty during the 1990’s is due only in part to the Clinton boom.  The Clinton Administration was also interested in reducing poverty – unlike the current Administration (apparently).  </p>
<p>But notice something else.  The War on Poverty continued to succeed during the 1970’s even though we had the Nixon recession and the Ford recession.  While it is clear that a go-go economy is not a sufficient condition for reducing poverty, one has to wonder whether it’s an even a necessary condition.  Then again – I’m on record as favoring more aggregate demand growth (which is to say I hope our friend <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002969.html">Max Sawicky</a> doesn’t shoot me).</p>
