                                <p><a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070430/greider">William Greider</a> reviews <em>Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests</em> by William Baumol and Ralph Gomory who used to be a senior vice president at IBM.  The challenge goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>At IBM back in the 1980s, Gomory watched in awe as Japan and other Asian nations captured high-tech industrial sectors in which US companies held commanding advantage. IBM invented the disk drive, then dropped out of the disk-drive business, unable to compete profitably. Gomory marveled at Singapore, a tiny city-state, as it lured American manufacturers with low-wage labor, capital subsidies and tax breaks. The US companies turned Singapore into a global center for semiconductor production. &#8220;It was an unforgettable transformation,&#8221; Gomory remembers. &#8220;And it was pretty frightening. &#8220;The offer that many Asian countries will give to American companies is essentially this: &#8216;Come over here and enhance our GDP. If you are here our people will be building disk drives, for example, instead of something less productive. In return, we&#8217;ll help you with the investment, with taxes, maybe even with wages. We&#8217;ll make sure you make a profit.&#8217; This works for both sides: the American company gets profits, the host country gets GDP. However, there is another effect beyond the benefits for those two parties&#8211;high-value-added jobs leave the U.S.&#8221;  China and India, he observes, are now doing this on a large scale. Microsoft and Google opened rival research centers in Beijing. Intel announced a new, $2.5 billion semiconductor plant that will make it one of China&#8217;s largest foreign investors. China&#8217;s industrial transformation is no longer about making shirts and shoes, as some free-trade cheerleaders still seem to believe. It is about capturing the most advanced processes and products.The multinationals&#8217; overseas deployment of capital and technology, Gomory explains, is the core of how some very poor developing nations are able to ratchet up their technological prowess, take over advanced industrial sectors and rapidly expand their share in global trade&#8211;all with the help of US companies and finance, as they roam the world in search of better returns. The Gomory-Baumol book describes this as &#8220;a divergence of interests&#8221; between multinational firms and their home country. &#8220;This overseas investment decision may then prove to be very good for that multinational firm,&#8221; they write. &#8220;But there remains the question: Is the decision good for its own country?&#8221; In many cases, yes. If the firm is locating low-skilled industrial production in a very poor country, Americans get cheaper goods, trade expands for both sides and the result is &#8220;mutual gain.&#8221; But the trading partners enter a &#8220;zone of conflict&#8221; if the poor nation develops greater capabilities and assumes the production of more advanced goods. Then, the authors explain, &#8220;the newly developing partner becomes harmful to the more industrialized country.&#8221; The firm&#8217;s self-interested success &#8220;can constitute an actual loss of national income for the company&#8217;s home country.&#8221; American multinationals, as principal actors in this transfer of wealth-generating productive capacity, are distinctively free to make the decisions for themselves without interference from government. They want profit and future consumer markets. Their home country wants to maintain a highly productive high-wage economy. Without recognizing it, the two are pulling in opposite directions&#8211;the &#8220;divergence of interests&#8221; most US politicians ignore, evidently believing church doctrine over visible reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Technology transfers are often a good means for increasing productivity in less developed nations.  Ah but those transfers of technology undermined IBM monopoly rights.  As this <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2007/04/the_nattering_n.html">David Altig</a> critique of something from the <a href="http://naybob.blogspot.com/2007/04/poor-sweet-little-vonage.html">Nattering Naybob</a> economists often disagree as to whether protecting monopoly rights by patents are good in that they reward innovation or bad because they restrict competition. </p>
<p><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&#038;tid=3682">This summary</a> has me embarrassed that I have yet to read <em>Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this book Ralph Gomory and William Baumol adapt classical trade models to the modern world economy. Trade today is dominated by manufactured goods, rapidly moving technology, and huge firms that benefit from economies of scale. This is very different from the largely agricultural world in which the classical theories originated. Gomory and Baumol show that the new and significant conflicts resulting from international trade are inherent in modern economies. <br />Today improvement in one country&#8217;s productive capabilities is often attainable only at the expense of another country&#8217;s general welfare. The authors describe why and when this is so and why, in a modern free-trade environment, a country might have a vital stake in the competitive strength of its industries.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>An <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/04/13/hillary.clinton.ap/index.html">interesting proposal</a> from Senator Clinton:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pledging to rebuild &#8220;the competence of government and the confidence of the American people,&#8221; Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton says she wants to streamline the functions of the federal government and boost its accountability to taxpayers.  The Democratic presidential front-runner was to offer details of a government reform plan Friday in a speech at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, She was expected to propose cutting 500,000 government contractors for a savings of up to $18 billion a year. In an interview with The Associated Press, Clinton said the government needed to become more consumer-friendly, cost-efficient and transparent in the way it does <br />business … She said she would limit the Bush administration practice of hiring private companies to perform government functions and would work to boost the performance of key agencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which she said performed well during her husband&#8217;s White House years. &#8220;People are rightly disturbed by what they see as the incompetence and corruption in this administration. And that&#8217;s undermined confidence in government, which makes it very difficult for us to meet the challenges we face today,&#8221; Clinton said. Her proposals echoed &#8220;Reinventing Government,&#8221; or REGO, a program launched during her husband&#8217;s administration and run by Vice President Al Gore. REGO was credited with saving taxpayers more than $136 billion over eight years by cutting the federal work force, trimming layers of management and cutting subsidies for items like mohair and wool.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, this does sound an Al Gore redux.  And $18 billion a year represents less than 0.15% of GDP.  But one has to start somehow if one wants to get a handle on the massive Federal deficit.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.hillaryclinton.com/blog/view/?id=3879">Crystal Patterson</a> is providing more discussion on the Senator’s government reform plan.  OK, Crystal works for her campaign.  I don’t and I’m hoping to hear more from John Edwards.</p>

<p>OK, you might ask what else but let’s check out the latest from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NWYyYTU2NTRlNmVhZDUwYWUxZDE1OTFkYTIzYjYxN2U=">Lawrence Kudlow</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Right now, gold, the dollar, bond spreads, and commodities all point to inflationary money from the Fed … Some of my supply-side colleagues have been warning of higher inflation for the last few years on the basis of three dead bodies: rising gold and commodity prices and a soft dollar index. But I have avoided the inflation call because the bond market hasn’t signaled a move to higher price indexes. Frankly, the bond market is a far more broad, deep, and resilient indicator than gold, commodities, or the dollar. Hence, it deserves a disproportionately high ranking in the body-count scheme.  Additionally, the Treasury bond has even greater analytical meaning because of the inflation-adjusted bonds (or TIPS) that trade in the open market. Basically, the 10-year Treasury bond can be deconstructed into a growth component (the real rate) and an inflation component (the TIPS spread). And so far this year the 10-year TIPS inflation spread has risen about 21 basis points, putting it above its 5-year average. So is it the fourth dead body? Well, the modest widening of the TIPS inflation spread may be a weak signal of inflation risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>We could be mean here is note that Kudlow has fretted over rising commodity prices and then explain to him why this is a silly measure of inflation expectations.  But let’s agree with his emphasis on the spread between nominal interest rates and the 10-year TIPS.  Our graph shows the monthly averages of the 10-year Treasury bond rate and the 10-year TIPS or real interest rate from January 2003 to March 2007.  This spread has displayed a little noise over this period reaching 2.71% in March 2005 and was only 2.38% in March 2007.  I just checked <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update">here</a> and saw the on April 11, 2007, the nominal interest rate was 4.74% and the real interest rate was 2.28% implying a spread equal to 2.46%.  Yes, this is a really weak signal of rising inflation.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>In all my pieces on global warming, I have made one assertion that has not been challenged: That the marketplace cannot solve the problem of global warming and its associated problems. To be clear, I include with global warming such issues as depletion of resources, over-population, species extinction, and pollution. I see all of these issues as interconnected.</p>
<p>In an exchange between me and Don Merek in my post “Economics and Global Warming: the April IPCC report,” Don rose to the challenge. In response to my assertion that &#8220;the marketplace cannot handle a problem of this magnitude,&#8221; Don answered:</p>
<p>I see no other system that can do it.<br />Even if there was man made induced global warming, why does it require extracting more money from my wallet and give to government?<br />Given governments consistently poor record managing a variety of social, economic, and technical issues, government is the last entity to place trust in for the future of the world.<br />If many resources become scarce due to global warming, only the market can allocate it most efficiently with the price mechanism.<br />If land becomes more scarce, and the land must be divided between agricultural use versus industrial use versus living space for people, do you seriously believe government can allocate this best?<br />The track record for government is not there.</p>
<p>In this short piece, <i>I am not going to offer a direct counter Don’s assertions; rather, I would like to flesh out Don’s argument.</i> I am going to try to enunciate the credo of the free marketplace, along with some ancillary beliefs that many economists have.</p>
<p>First, I am going to use Mark Witte from Northwestern University teaching Ecnomics 201 to enunciate the efficacy of the free market place in meeting problems.</p>
<p>While not addressing global warming and environmental depletion and destruction, Mark Witte offers a good summary in his <a href="http://www.faculty.econ.northwestern.edu/faculty/witte/B01/handouts/econthink.html">201 Economics class handout</a>:</p>
<p>Markets are powerful force of nature.<br />They are not a necessarily a good force, but they are a powerful force that must be respected.<br />Markets embody a form of collective intelligence.<br />Markets somehow know how much food Chicago will need.<br />Could government or some genius do it as well? I doubt it.<br />Selfishness is a useful way of organizing society and a useful way of understanding how it is organized.</p>
<p>When I got this far in the post, I hit a roadblock. I wanted to find a reputable economist who satisfied two criteria: Had complete faith in the &#8220;free marketplace&#8221; sans government regulations or interference and fully accepted the science behind global warming and all the attendant consequences. I spent hours on the internet, searching. To no avail. I suspected that freemaketers sense that global warming cannot be handled within the framework of their economic beliefs.</p>
<p>All this said, I will press on, doing my best to give the best possible argument to the free market.</p>
<p>In summary, because the marketplace works on the principle of self-interest&#8211;a kind of collective intelligence&#8211;it is the best way to address societal needs; in fact, it may be the only way. Government will fail. It&#8217;s intentions may be good, but it is inefficient and clumsy, its work always suffering from the problem of unintended consequences.</p>
<p>By extension, the marketplace is the only way in which to face such issues as crashing fish stocks, ocean acidification, weather changes, sea rise, desertification, terrestrial species extinction, decreasing glacier water sources, depleting resources, pollution, overpopulation, etc. Governmental intervention cannot fairly or intelligently solve these issues. In fact, such intervention is more likely to make matters worse.</p>
<p>There are two ancillary parts of the economic &#8220;credo,&#8221; if I may call it that. The first is a profound belief in technology. The other is the belief that continued growth is the key to prosperity; in fact, without continued growth, the world might collapse.</p>
<p>Economists often see technology not only as a driver of the market place but also as a means of solving whatever problems it creates as well as fulfilling its needs. Furthermore, the market place creates conditions for technology to create surprising and useful things. In a curious way, selfishness drives technology. Is there a problem or a need? Out of self-interest someone will use technology to solve it. As Milton Friedman said, only a free market can make <a href="http://www.theinternetparty.org/commentary/c_s.php?td=20021028160111&#038;section_type=com">a pencil</a>. The marketplace and technology are two sides of the same coin, both driven by self-interest. The marketplace can determine exactly how much food Chicago needs; if a food source expires or crashes, technology will find a replacement. Such was the case when Greenspan testified before the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/testimony/2003/20030610/default.htm">Committe of Commerce and Energy</a>, saying that frozen methane hydrates were a solution to the energy crises. He did not address the technological issues or whether we could solve the problem within ten or twenty years. He assumed that the solution was within reach. Technology can do it&#8230;now.</p>
<p>Although the following is not in keeping with making this piece a serious defense of the marketplace, I cannot resist one techno-solution that <a href="http://blog.mises.org/archives/006389.asp">George Reisman at Mises.org</a> offers for global warming: A carefully controlled nuclear winter. Yup, set off a few atomic bombs at strategic locations. Of course, Reisman does not take global warming seriously, but just in case: atom bombs.</p>
<p>And finally, the last part of the economic credo: Without continued growth, the world might fall apart. Here is Tyler Cowen, addressing the issue of global warming over at <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/05/my_views_on_glo.html">The Marginal Revolution</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have yet to see a real plan which recognizes three points: a) without continued economic growth the world will probably fall apart, b) the problem is real and significant, c) any good preventive solution would require an enormous amount of concerted action across both time and across nations</p></blockquote>
<p>Tim goes on to say, conveniently, that the threat global warming most probably is overstated.</p>
<p>Here we come, I think, to the heart of the dilemma that economists face: If the world will fall apart if continued growth is not sustained&#8211;even given the occasional recession or depression&#8211;, how then do we confront global warming, if the scientists are correct? The IPCC seems to be drawing apocolyptic scenarios, threats on a global scale. Economists are generally very uncomfortable with the picture the IPCC and thousands of scientists are drawing; they understand what this may mean to &#8220;continued&#8221; growth.</p>
<p>Even though I do not agree that the free market place is the answer, let me advance further the argument for the marketplace. Suppose, just suppose, everyone&#8211;including the economists&#8211;accepted the scientific reports, all of them, from crashing fish stocks, resource depletion, species extinctions, weather, sea-rising, pollution, over-population&#8230;you know the drill.</p>
<p>Would not, out of self-interest, the market place respond intelligently? Would not the collective wisdom of the billions of rational beings comprising the market place, acting from pure self-interest, put a premium on those activities to lessen, to mitigate, yea, to reverse global warming? After all, the market place determines value. The highest value is self-preservation.</p>
<p>Could government intervention, in the final analysis, be left out of the equation? Or must governments create artifical market places&#8211;through carbon trading, carbon taxation, etc. Are those enough? Is something more needed?</p>
<p>Can the marketplace alone, along with technology, handle these issue?</p>
<p>If free marketers cannot show that their policies of deregulation, low taxation&#8211;all part of the free market mentality&#8211;are enough to deal with global warming, population growth, weather, pollution, rising seas, depletion of essential resources etc&#8211;then they and the free market mentality may well be an endangered species in the not too distant future.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10497.html">Steve Benen</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2007/04/12/lost_documents/index.html">Glenn Greenwald</a> has a story about how frequently this administration seems to lose documents at times when losing those documents is convenient.</p>
<p>Examples include:<br />1.  E-mails on RNC servers<br />2.  The &#8220;gap&#8221; in DOJ e-mails relating to the US Attorney firings<br />3.  The video of Padilla being interrogated<br />4.  From 2004, documents relating to the treatment of prisoners<br />5.  2,000 pages missing from a report provided to the Senate detailing abuses at Abu Ghraib<br />6.  The gap in GW&#8217;s service record<br />7.  The transcript of the Katrina video conference<br />8.  Records of the interrogation of war protestors by the FBI</p>
<p>In several of these cases, the records themselves were alleged not exist in the first place, but turned up later when evidence of their existence was brought forward by third parties.  One can only imagine what else has disappeared.  Pretty nifty for an administration that claims the right to read everyone else&#8217;s private correspondence.</p>

<p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002989.html">Max Sawicky</a> asks a good question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why do so many bloggers engage in online debates with Jonah Goldberg? He&#8217;s a gigantic honking ignoramus. He doesn&#8217;t know anything about anything. I don&#8217;t get it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The same applies to Donald Luskin who should never be confused with an economist.  OK, we had some fun with the debate between Barry Ritholtz and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/luskin-on-bush-economy.html">Luskin</a>.  But I have to regretfully report that this was only Round One.  <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2007/04/impact-of-mew-on-pce.html">CalculatedRisk</a> covers Round Two and <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/ritholtz-v-luskin-round-3.html">Kash</a> covers Round Three.  Could someone tell James Pethokoukis that Luskin is not an economist?  If one just considers the babbling in this Three Round match that should have been ruled a TKO a long time ago, you can see just how stupid this Ronald Luskin (OK, Kash misspelled his name but this may have been a Freudian slip as in Ronald McDonald aka a Clown) truly is. </p>
<p>Let’s start with this from Luskin:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, there are no authoritative statistics on MEW; no reliable agency really claims to know what fraction of mortgage volume went into cash extraction. Second, even if we overlook that, nobody knows what fraction of that cash went into consumption. Third, even if we overlook that, we have no idea what consumption funded by other sources would have been if there had been no MEW.  For the MEW analysis to have any meaning, it has to connect to consumption. It&#8217;s consumption that is a component of GDP &#8211; MEW is not, any more than the stock market is. MEW is nothing more than a hypothetical explanation for consumption.</p></blockquote>
<p>Barry replies:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don asserts there are no &#8220;authoritative statistics on MEW.&#8221;  This is wildly incorrect. The impact of mortgage equity withdrawal on consumer spending was calculated via the &#8220;Greenspan-Kennedy&#8221; method, a statistical system developed by Fed economist James Kennedy and former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan. Kennedy/Greenspan determined that 51 percent of MEW flowed through to personal consumption. There is also a small Wall Street shop &#8211; Goldman Sachs &#8211; whose methodology calculated that 68 percent of mortgage withdrawals was converted into consumer spending. (See Jan Hatzius&#8217;s &#8220;Housing Holds the Key to Fed Policy,&#8221; Global Econocs Paper No. 137, Goldman Sachs, February 2006).</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if one never heard of James Kennedy or Jan Hatzius, one would have to wonder how Luskin could make such a claim.  After all, his National Review buddies such as Lawrence Kudlow keep reminding us that we should monitor the Federal Reserve’s Flow of Funds accounting of household net wealth.  My problem with Kudlow’s monitoring of this, however, is that he doesn’t realize that the increase in real per capita net worth over the past seven years has been quite modest.  Also – if Luskin does not realize that changes in net worth affect consumption, maybe he should check out the Ando and Modigliani life cycle model of consumption.  </p>
<p>Luskin does have a habit of ignoring economic research preferring his own meaningless correlation, which CR calls <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_inkblot_test">Rorschach inkblot test</a>.  And as Kash points out, Luskin seems to be playing around with the various definitions of “core GDP”:</p>
<blockquote><p>The evidence that Luskin cites when he makes that assertion comes from last quarter&#8217;s GDP numbers. They show that the fall in residential investment (i.e. new house construction) subtracted 1.2% from the nation&#8217;s overall real GDP growth. But one could just as easily exclude any other disliked portion of GDP, and come up with the opposite conclusion. How about &#8220;real GDP actually grew by 2.5%, but was propped up by the large rise in government spending, without which economic growth would have only been an anemic 1.9%,&#8221; or &#8220;falling imports (which may well signal falling consumer demand) artificially boosted GDP growth, which would otherwise have been only 2.0%.&#8221; The point is a simple one: it makes no sense to exclude portions of the economy when trying to discern its direction, since all sectors of the economy contribute to its overall performance.</p></blockquote>
<p>That was the point that I tried to make about Round One.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/05/george_w_bush_r.html">Brad DeLong</a> had a good comment on this a while back:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because they have no idea what &#8220;nominal core GDP&#8221; would mean. What they have calculated is nominal private absorption &#8211; not nominal core GDP.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad was having fun with my shrillness after reading some garbage from Michael Darda and from Lawrence Kudlow.  Absorption is the sum of private consumption, general government consumption and gross domestic investment.  If one removes government purchases, one has the sum of private consumption, business investment, and residential investment, which is how Darda defines core GDP.  Luskin is following the Kudlow tradition of defining core GDP as the sum of private consumption and business investment.  But Luskin is adding back in government purchases and net exports.  </p>
<p>I think I know why Darda and Kudlow wanted to talk about absorption over the past few years.  It’s because the decline in net exports led to a situation where real GDP growth was less than the growth in absorption as our net exports continued to decline.  OK, net exports grew by a tiny amount in 2006.  But let’s graph the growth rates of private consumption and government purchases as well as the growth rates of business fixed investment and residential investment.  </p>
<p>Our first graph shows that the early kick from fiscal stimulus seems to have been from increases in government purchases but in the last couple of years, it has been from increases in consumption.  Maybe there is more to this MEW than Luskin thinks.  But also notice that as business investment demand was weak during the 2002 and 2003 period of a very slow recovery, it was residential investment that was giving the economy a boost.  Now that residual investment demand is declining – Luskin says we should just ignore all of that?  </p>
<p>If James Pethokoukis wants to feature more debates that include Barry Ritholz, that’s great.  But could he be given a worthy opponent and not some arrogant clown like Donald Luskin?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As a follow-up of my post last night on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/precariousness.html">precariousness</a>, I want to run a thought experiment.  Consider a family of four &#8211; husband, wife, and two kids age seven and eight &#8211; that lives in a small in the West.  Both the husband and wife lose their jobs &#8211; perhaps the town sawmill or the factory where he worked closed down costing him his job, and as a result, the waitress job she had dried up as well.  That story has been told millions of times recently.  </p>
<p>Now, what should they do?  Well, they should move where the jobs are.  Usually, that&#8217;s the city.  Say the city they pick is Los Angeles.  I put together a basic spreadsheet of expenses they need.  I left out things like, well, clothes, toys, entertainment, car repairs, unexpected expenses, and the like.  </p>
<p>Before I put up figures, let&#8217;s talk about where they come from.  From what I can tell, $1,200 a month gets you a one bedroom apartment in a neighborhood where police helicopters fly overhead several times a week.  I know because I live in such a neighborhood, and $1,200 seems to be what they charge people moving in around here based on the signs I&#8217;ve seen.  (The Ex-GF and I pay quite a bit less than that &#8211; as I&#8217;ve alluded before, I suspect the landlord is in a coma.)  I&#8217;m sure there are neighborhoods where its even less, and perhaps you can pay less if you&#8217;re twenty feet from the freeway.</p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t put a family of four in a one bedroom apartment.  Two bedrooms is probably a bit tight.  But let&#8217;s say the family goes for a two bedroom.  $1,500 is the lowest price I&#8217;ve seen posted around here lately for anything that is even a step up from a hovel.</p>
<p>Health insurance&#8230; the Ex-GF and I pay nearly $300 apiece.  Surprisingly, there is no discount for a joint account.  I am assuming adding two kids adds $300 to the bill.  (Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong.)</p>
<p>Food&#8230;  I&#8217;m assuming its as cheap as it gets:  $4 per meal per adult, and $2.50 per meal per child, on average, every day.) </p>
<p>Car insurance and gasoline&#8230; one needs a car in order to look for work, and for most jobs.  Most jobs are not going to be close to a place where one can rent a two bedroom apartment for $1,500 a month.  I rode a bus every day for many years, and I can tell you its only possible if there&#8217;s a bus that goes where you want to go.  I can also tell you its not free either.  Anyway, the car insurance and gasoline figures are based on mine and the Ex-GF&#8217;s.  Bear in mind, I work from home.</p>
<p>Cellphones:  I assumed they need to communicate, and won&#8217;t bother with a landline.</p>
<p>Taxes:  I figured 5% and 15% is probably just about at the low end (but not egregiously so) for people making the monthly income they&#8217;re making.</p>
<p>Anyway, the figures are:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rh4uEq_gCfI/AAAAAAAAALQ/xmtDaiUbNQQ/s1600-h/income+and+expenses.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rh4uEq_gCfI/AAAAAAAAALQ/xmtDaiUbNQQ/s320/income+and+expenses.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Thus, the family&#8217;s absolute minimum expenses come to close to $65K.  As reader ddickson reminds us in the thread to the previous post, the four person median income in CA is about $70K.   Throw in clothes for the kids, something to entertain them (do kids like playing with string as much as cats do?), the odd emergency and visit to Chuck E. Cheese&#8230;  I don&#8217;t think they should move here unless they&#8217;re going to make well over the median income.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Update.  When you&#8217;re in a hurry, you forgot things.  I forgot SS&#8230;  Assume its 7.5% (they&#8217;re not entrepreneurs), add that back in, and the expenses are now just about at $70K. </p>
<p>Granted, its a difference of $5K a year, but I don&#8217;t think privatizing SS is going to be the panacea that saves this family, even in the short run.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Update 2.  Fellow Angry Bear Divorced One Like Bush notes that EPI has a <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/datazone_fambud_budget">family budget calculator</a>.  Their figures (which date to September 2005) for the LA &#8211; Long Beach are a bit different from mine.  They come up with figures of $48K a year.  That said, I&#8217;d hate to see what housing costs of $1,124 buys a family of four around here these days.  And their health care figures presumably assume only the kids have health insurance.  </p>
<p>Finally, with their lower figures&#8230; they still conclude that 33% of people in the state live with incomes below that minimum family budget line.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/013579.php">Joshn Marshall</a>, an <a href="http://www.fortwayne.com/mld/journalgazette/17062173.htm">AP story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The White House said Wednesday it had mishandled Republican Party-sponsored e-mail accounts used by nearly two dozen presidential aides, resulting in the loss of an undetermined number of e-mails concerning official White House business.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three dots.</p>
<blockquote><p>He said staffers used their RNC accounts instead of White House accounts to discuss the prosecutor issue or conduct other official business for several reasons, including extra caution about complying with the Hatch Act as well as the convenience of using one account instead of several. Stanzel said he could not speak to whether anyone was intentionally trying to avoid White House archiving because he had not spoken to all those involved.</p>
<p>Stanzel said some e-mails have been lost because the White House lacked clear policies on complying with Presidential Records Act requirements.</p>
<p>Before 2004, for instance, e-mails to and from the accounts were typically automatically deleted every 30 days along with all other RNC e-mails. Even though that was changed in 2004, so that the White House staffers with those accounts were excluded from the RNC&#8217;s automatic deletion policy, some of their e-mails were lost anyway when individual aides deleted their own files, Stanzel said.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>The separate e-mail accounts also have become an issue in the case of disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who was convicted on bribery charges and is in prison for fraud.</p>
<p>Abramoff had several exchanges with Susan Ralston, then a Rove assistant, via nongovernment e-mail addresses with domain names like rnchq.org and georgewbush.com, to discuss issues in the Interior Department affecting the lobbyist&#8217;s Indian clients.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes you have to give people the benefit of the doubt. But I think this administration is well beyond that point.</p>

                                <p>The Ex-GF and I were putting together a budget. She&#8217;s beginning the transition into a new career, which means for a while we&#8217;re on a single income. My income isn&#8217;t bad &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what percentile I&#8217;m in for California, but I remember median 4 person households figures for California and I know that well over half of the households in CA have less income than I do. </p>
<p>Now, our expenses are also low. I moved in with the Ex-GF before we got married, and she has got to have one of the lowest rents in LA. We pay precisely what I used to pay for a place in Little Rock, AR &#8211; seven years ago. Our cars are paid off. We&#8217;re good drivers, so our car insurance is not particularly high. I often work from home, so transportation expenses are low. We don&#8217;t eat out often, and we don&#8217;t lead extravagant lifestyles. The Ex-GF is one heck of a bargain hunter. I try to put away 10% of my income every month and fully fund my IRA. Other than this more or less automatic saving (and in some months, not other than it), our biggest after-tax expense is our health insurance, and both of us are healthy. We don&#8217;t drink or smoke, we exercise, and neither of us have ever had any expensive care. At the moment, there are just the two of us plus two cats.  </p>
<p>When I total everything up &#8211; reasonably good income, good spending habits, very low expenses, I find that we&#8217;re still living damn close to hand-to-mouth. And there is another thing &#8211; precariousness. If a little bit of consulting work dries up, or the landlord wakes up from a coma, or I get sick &#8211; then everything falls apart.</p>
<p>People a generation older than I tell me this feeling of a complete lack of a safety net is a new thing. I do know I didn&#8217;t feel it in the 1990s.  I also know its not pleasant. And I also know its not just from being an entrepreneur. Friends of mine with jobs tell me they&#8217;re feeling just as precarious, and have been for the past few years.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine its a good thing.</p>
