                                <p>As only Jon Stewart and the Daily Show can do it, here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/video/2848397">debate</a> between First Term President GW Bush and Second Term GW Bush on the matter of Iraq.</p>
<p>In other GW related Iraq news, we learn that <a href="http://americablog.blogspot.com/2007/04/laura-bush-wants-you-to-know-that-when.html">nobody suffers more as a result of the war in Iraq</a> than GW and Laura Bush. We know this because&#8230; Laura Bush said so. And as Steve Benen  <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10615.html#more-10615">reminds us</a>, GW told us just a few months ago that <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2006/12/bushs_first_com.html">he sleeps quite well at night</a>.</p>
<p>So&#8230; if nobody suffers more due to Iraq than GW and the First Lady, and GW doesn&#8217;t lose any sleep over it, I guess we can conclude that things really are going well.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>There has been a lot of debate about what being drafted might cost a draftee, and how much it might cost in training that is not used for a long career.</p>
<p>The implication is the volunteers stay on a long time and are paying back a larger return on the training investment.  This is true for pilots and for certain skills which have entrance requirements and have service commitments to be “paid” by the soldier receiving the training.</p>
<p>Training pay back is not that much of an issue with the combat arms skills.  Retention there is becoming an issue.</p>
<p>So, if you discount the difference in training between a drafted force and an all volunteer force you should look at some of the cost of not using a draft.</p>
<p>It is expensive to lower your educational and aptitude standards, many things cost more from extra training failures, to writing technical instructions at the 8th grade reading level, to extensive remedial training and low retention rates all argue against the idea that it would be more costly to have a percent of the Army as draftees.</p>
<p>There are also added costs of designing things to be simpler to use for the lower aptitude volunteers.  We also begin to trade expensive design approaches with more development and support costs as well as contractors in the operational areas because of the aptitude drop of the all volunteer force.</p>
<p>Contractor support also covers up for the manning limits at greater cost in many cases than doing the job with soldiers, particularly where there is eminent danger from combat operations.</p>
<p>In the period since the draft ended equipment support costs have risen faster than military personnel costs for a much smaller force.  It is not all aging equipment or operations tempo.</p>
<p>We see more functions done by software, expensive, unreliable and hard to maintain software instead of using skilled skilled military personnel who are hard to recruit.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the moral issue.  The services have had to lower their standards for character and psychiatric issues to meet recruiting needs, these standards would remain high with a draft supplemented force.</p>
<p>There are more  moral arguments, those being the draftees comes in with a critical eye, not wanting to be there they want the thing over fast, desiring to go back to being tax payers they want it over cheap and they criticize the same old processes (SOP’s) and demand improvements in efficiency which career soldiers may over look so as not to rock the boat.</p>
<p>In my quick view; a higher caliber soldier and a little rocking the boat make strong arguments for the draft.</p>

<p>Let me just say this plainly &#8211; <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjdkMjg4MGMxYmQ5YThhY2U1YTVjZmY4MDYzM2M5Zjk=">Jerry Bowyer</a> loves to lie to the readers of the National Review:</p>
<blockquote><p>What the media did not note, however, is that the current rate of black unemployment is lower than the average rate achieved during President Bill Clinton’s second term, and that black unemployment has dropped precipitously since the full implementation of President George W. Bush’s tax cuts in late May 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bowyer provides a chart of the black unemployment rate that starts on March 2003.  Why is this dishonest?  Let’s take his chart back to January 1993 and also include the overall unemployment rate.  You may recall that the Bush crowd tried this average unemployment rate during Clinton’s Presidency nonsense during the 2004 campaign as well.  Just as overall unemployment fell during Clinton’s eight years in office so did black unemployment.  And just as overall unemployment rose during Bush’s first two years in office, black unemployment rose from 7.4% as of December 2000 to 11.3% during December 2002.  That it had finally fallen to 7.9% as of February 2007 is simply a sign that economies do eventually recover from recessions.  Whoops – black unemployment went back up to 8.3% last month.  </p>
<p>We have also provided the labor force participation (LFP) and employment to population (EP) ratios for blacks from January 1993 to March 2007 – with the unemployment rate representing the difference.  Notice the employment to population ratio went up from 54.2% to 60.7% while Clinton was in office.  The drop in the unemployment rate was only part of the story as the labor force participation rate also rose.  Now it was still lower than the overall labor force participation rate, which is additional reason why a smaller percentage of black adults are counted as employed.  But notice how both the labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio fell during Bush’s first three years in office – sort of like the general trends for the overall labor market.   By December 2003, the black employment to population was had declined to 56.8%.  It was also at 56.8% as of December 2004.  Thankfully, it has risen to 58.5% as of March 2007.  But this is far below where it was as of December 2000 and in fact lower than at any period during the last three years of Clinton’s second term.</p>
<p>Jerry Bowyer wants us to believe that Republicans really care about the livelihood of black Americans while we Democrats only exploit their hopes and dreams.  But Jerry Bowyer doesn’t even care enough to tell his readers the truth.  I guess this is par for the course for the National Review – deem their readers to be such stupid little children that deserve to be lied to.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This is a continuation of looking at the income of the top 10% of this country. Before we go further, let&#8217;s look at what kind of a money machine we are when compared to other countries.<br />This is a chart of GDP by country for 2005 based on data from data360.org.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Ri9OTsbVNTI/AAAAAAAAACM/LyfQvhCTCD8/s1600-h/GDP+by+Country+2.JPG"><img height="198" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Ri9OTsbVNTI/AAAAAAAAACM/LyfQvhCTCD8/s320/GDP+by+Country+2.JPG" width="378" border="0"></a>We seem to be quite the money generator. Japan, being next in line is only 36% of us. However, look at GDP per capita:</p>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Ri9OL8bVNSI/AAAAAAAAACE/pMDyZ89WvX0/s1600-h/GDP+per+Capita+2005.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Ri9OL8bVNSI/AAAAAAAAACE/pMDyZ89WvX0/s320/GDP+per+Capita+2005.JPG" border="0"></a>To accomplish what <a href="http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html">Switzerland</a> has achieved we would have needed 16% more in GDP for 2005. That is raising our&#8217;s from $12,455 trillion to $14,453 trillion. Switzerland is considered to have a more equal distribution of income with the top 20% taking 40.3% compared to us (or US) at 49.7%. The wealth held by the top 10% is 71.3% for Switzerland and 69.8% for us. If you would like to see more on distribution, <a href="http://www.tcf.org/list.asp?type=NC&#038;pubid=1403">this article </a>has a bar chart of income for the middle class as a percent of the top 10% by country.</div>
<p>
<div></div>
<p>
<div>At <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States">Wikipedia </a></div>
<p>
<div></div>
<p>
<blockquote>Households in the top quintile, 77% of which had two income earners, had incomes exceeding $91,705. Households in the mid quintile, with a mean of one income earner per household had incomes between $36,000 and $57,657.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<div>Recall that for the top 10% we are talking breakouts of:<br />90 to 95% $110,424<br />95 to 99% $176,925<br />99 to 100% $812,497<br />At 90% $96536, at 95% $130,373 at 99% $310,062.<br />The low limit for the top 20% is $88,030 (Wikipedia). The average individual income for a college graduate is $45,500 (2004, Wikipedia). </div>
<p>
<div></div>
<p>
<div>I point all this out because I believe our thinking about what middle America is, as defined by the American dream needs to reconsider the income it actually takes. The bottom of the top 20% is not far from the start of the top 10%. I thus question what are we talking when we talk “middle America”? Is it based simply on an income number at the peak of a curve, or does it refer to a defined life style? Part of the American Dream is home ownership (yes we all know that ownership is at record highs, for now anyway). Yet according to <a href="http://www.nhc.org/index/CenterNews-LockedOut-032206">this study</a>, they find:</div>
<p>
<div>
<blockquote>However, most of the gains have been among families without children and upper-income families with children. The study defines upper-income families as those families that earn above 120 percent of local area median. In 2003, the homeownership rate for upper-income families with children was 90.8 percent, while the rate for their low- to moderate-income counterparts was significantly lower at 59.6 percent – yet in 1978 some 62.5 percent of low-to moderate-income working families with children owned their homes.Ultimately, had the 1978 homeownership rates for working families with children prevailed in 2003, an additional 2.3 million children would now be living in owner-occupied homes.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>
<div>If you would like to see how your area is performing, they have an <a href="http://www.nhc.org/chp/p2p/">interactive page </a>that let&#8217;s you choose the location and the jobs.<br />The dream seems now only to be a definite with a 2 person, college educated and working household. That combination is not far from being in the 10% group. Thus, we have raised the dream to something beyond which a large portion of the population will not reach considering only 28% have a 4 year degree even though 64% of high school students are entering college. It looks even worse with people suggesting that you need an <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110009535">IQ of 110 </a>to succeed in college. I mean, can we push the dream any further out or be anymore aristocratic in our arguments? While we have done this, the median income for a bachelors has been going down from a high in 1999 of $70,925 to $68,728 in 2003. In fact, all levels of education have seen a decline and anyone with an associates degree or less has seen the median decline to less than that earned in 1991. But it does suggest that 2 people with an associates could even be in the top 10%!</div>
<p>
<div></div>
<p>
<div>Was the American Dream based on 2 people working or 1? Was the dream that more people would obtain it or fewer as time passed and the country earn more?</div>
<p>
<div>We have now arrived at that entity called income. The thing that is so necessary to get the American Dream (or save a state or few). The following 4 charts look at the 4 sources of income: wages, entrepreneurship, dividends and interest based on sub groups of 90 to 95%, 95 to 99%, 99 to 100% and 99.9 to 100%. The first is dividends. It is obvious, the top is not getting the money from this.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Ri90A8bVNUI/AAAAAAAAACU/g4yZO2fBvgc/s1600-h/Top+10%25+income+by+Dividends.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Ri90A8bVNUI/AAAAAAAAACU/g4yZO2fBvgc/s320/Top+10%25+income+by+Dividends.JPG" border="0"></a>
<div>The next is interest. The only curve I found that looked similar to the post 1950&#8217;s is the federal fund rate. So, it appears that as THE bank raises what it will charge, people will take some advantage of it. There is a lag in the time the rate starts to decline and when the population moves from this form of income.</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Ri9N78bVNQI/AAAAAAAAAB0/2zFfUvsOjYI/s1600-h/Top+10%25+income+by+Interest.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Ri9N78bVNQI/AAAAAAAAAB0/2zFfUvsOjYI/s320/Top+10%25+income+by+Interest.JPG" border="0"></a>Next is entrepreneurship. I think this shows, that something more than freeing up capital has to happen to generate a shift of earning money from just going to work to earning money from creating work. Note how it moves counter to income from interest.</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Ri9NyMbVNPI/AAAAAAAAABs/UqPKf87RTtE/s1600-h/Top+10%25+income+by+Entrepreneurship.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Ri9NyMbVNPI/AAAAAAAAABs/UqPKf87RTtE/s320/Top+10%25+income+by+Entrepreneurship.JPG" border="0"></a>Even those in the low end of the top 10 take advantage of a life altering event. But, it is clear just going to college is not going to push an entrepreneurial spirit considering this lower 90 to 95% group is at the upper end of the college degree for a single person working. They show minimal initiative toward self reliance in producing income for themselves. The next chart confirms this. They do take advantage of interest rates rising, but they are not buying companies or shares of companies to make money. They are following the what I would consider the American Dream, go to work, earn a comfortable living that supplies the comforts and advantages of modern living.</div>
<p>
<div></div>
<p>
<div>Finally is the share of income from wages.</div>
<p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Ri9Nn8bVNOI/AAAAAAAAABk/BQdii64725s/s1600-h/Top+10%25+income+by+wages.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Ri9Nn8bVNOI/AAAAAAAAABk/BQdii64725s/s320/Top+10%25+income+by+wages.JPG" border="0"></a> </div>
<p>
<div>The lower end of this group is not seeing an increase of income from wages. But look at the change in the top 1% and the top 0.1%. They have the greatest increase of their income coming from wages. The entire top 5% sees this, but it is the very top that is seeing a doubling (32 to 63% for the top 1%) and tripling (18.1 to 58.2 for the top 0.1%) of the percentage from wages. Where do you suppose such an increase in income via wages could be coming from? What is the motive or reasoning?</div>
<p>
<div>So, the very top is getting a higher share of the income we (all of US, they don&#8217;t do it alone) generate via starting companies and then are paying themselves greater shares of the income said company generates. Is this not greed? Or is there an insulating effect do to globalization? I believe it is both and frankly don&#8217;t care which came first. Is this what we would expect if supply side tax cutting was raising all boats as suggested? It sure is not trickling down. I say it is not what would be expected. I would not hypothesize that we would see only the top 5% contributing to growth via entrepreneurship as compared to the pre 1929 crash when the top 10% contributed toward growth via entrepreneurship. Loosing the 90 to 95% group to wages is most telling as to how much the American Dream is one of an implied contract based on labor and not on entrepreneurial freedom. It is also a sign of failure of policy if promoting entrepreneurship as a viable means of obtaining the American Dream was the goal.</div>
<p>
<div>These charts show that everyone is earning the majority of their money by working for someone. Again, the American dream is based on labor supplied to another, even for the highest income earners. If we are going to change what is happening in Michigan or Ohio or in this country, we are going to have to figure out a way to get those who decide how much some one will be paid to start paying more to those below the top 1% because the top 1% is where the greatest concentration of income is happening and it&#8217;s happening through wages. It is not that we don&#8217;t have the growth and thus don&#8217;t have the money. We have it. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Update: I have fixed the link for the dividends chart and removed one that was a dead end. Sorry for the mix up.</div>

                                <p>I had a post the other day about unwanted e-mail, and how it has begun becoming more of a problem (at least to me).</p>
<p>This morning, I found a message purportedly from me.  It came from what appears to be my own e-mail address.  Now, why would that be effective?  Why would they send me something and pretend I sent it to myself?  What could they possibly gain from this?</p>

                                <p>As I recall, the main purpose for the invasion of Iraq when it happened was to remove a threat to the US.  This meant decapitating the regime and removing their WMDs.  Now, let&#8217;s say the administration had planned to do that, and more or less just that.  What would it have done differently?</p>
<p>The invasion would probably have proceeded more or less as it occurred.  It is possible that more troops would have been available in the early days &#8211; if everyone knew ahead of time it was for a limited three month deployment, American troops could have been brought in from Germany, South Korea, etc.  (And yes, everyone knew that beating the Iraqi regime would be done quickly.  The Iraqis haven&#8217;t been a formidable military power for about thousand years.  In 1991 trained Iraqis surrendered to CNN, and training hadn&#8217;t improved since then.)</p>
<p>Once the invasion took place, the US could have announced a date for elections a couple months later, and a pull-out date a month after that leaving a small force in country to look for WMDs and as a symbol of its will.  What would have been the effect of that?  Well, immediately after WW2, the US military and the Red Army and the Brits and the French started sending their troops from Germany.  Did that cause the Germans to rise up?  Similarly, the declining size of the US military in Asia in late 1945 and 1946 didn&#8217;t lead to a Japanese rebellion either.  Bear in mind&#8230; there were still plenty of guns in the hands of very well trained (unlike Iraqis) Germans and Japanese soldiers at the time.  </p>
<p>In Iraq, a US departure (if done right) could have accomplished the same thing.  Sure, there are Sunnis and Shias and Kurds and Baathists and secularits and fundamentalists and even some Al Qaeda and who knows what else running around in Iraq.  Would that have led to a fight?  Well, no.  Because the US would have a credible threat &#8211; we can walk right back in again time.  And it would be credible, because it would have happened once with no deleterious effects to the US.  (Again&#8230; there were a bunch of different factions in Germany in 1946, and armed Germans sure as heck outnumbered armed Americans in West Germany.) </p>
<p>Letting an Iraqi government hang Baathist criminals would probably have had a unifying effect on the country.  </p>
<p>(A digression&#8230; one might argue&#8230; sure, but the Germans had a history of democracy, the Iraqis did not.  But Germany had gone twelve years without democracy of any sort, and they were able to come right back to it.)</p>
<p>And incidentally, that credible threat&#8230; it would apply to other countries as well.  The Dear Leader of North Korea is only afraid of one thing&#8230; the decapitation of his regime.  He isn&#8217;t afraid that the US will do it, however, because he&#8217;s seen how it happened in Iraq, and how much it cost us.  But&#8230; if it had happened as I describe above, at relatively low cost (in lives and treasure), it would be one heck of a credible threat.  Ditto Iran, Syria, Libya, etc.  Maybe even Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.  (Sure, Libya did throw in a few baubbles as a result of the Iraq invasion, but Kaddafi is the stupid one among the tyrants in that part of the world.  It didn&#8217;t occur to him to wait around and see what the results were going to be, and sure enough, he&#8217;s since come back to criticizing the West.)</p>
<p>Would the same results occur if the US pulled out now?  Well, no.  Its a matter of timing.  The US has already demonstrated weakness&#8230; for the last three years. </p>
<p>But maybe, just maybe &#8211; announcing a no-nonsense pull-out date under our terms and conditions, might get a smidge of that credibility back.</p>

                                <p>This is one of the scariest stories I ever read. If this is correct, we are officially living in a Banana Republic.

<blockquote><p><a href="http://toolbar.netcraft.com/site_report?url=http://election.sos.state.oh.us">Netcraft</a> is showing that an event happened in the Ohio 2004 election that is difficult to explain. The <a href="http://election.sos.state.oh.us/">Secretary of State&#8217;s website</a>, which handles election reporting, normally is directed to an Ohio-based IP address hosted by the Ohio Supercomputer Center. On Nov. 3 2004, Netcraft shows the website pointing out of state to a server owned by Smartech Corp. According to the American Registry on Internet Numbers, Smartech&#8217;s <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/64.203.98.137">block of IP addresses</a> 64.203.96.0 – 64.203.111.255 encompasses the entire <a href="http://ws.arin.net/cgi-bin/whois.pl?queryinput=!%20NET-64-203-98-0-1">range of addresses</a> owned by the Republican National Committee. Smartech hosted the recently notorious <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/gwb43.com">gwb43.com</a> domain used from the White House in apparent violation of the Presidential Records Act, from which <a href="http://politics.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/12/1933215&#038;tid=215">thousands of White House emails vanished</a>. Can anyone suggest a good explanations for this seemingly dubious election-eve transfer?</p></blockquote>

                                <p>It is time to support the endless hold option of Bush&#8217;s policy.</p>
<p>It is time the nation mobilized, based on age and ability.  It is time to provide the youth of the US with the opportunity to should the burden of citizenship, to protect the nation and implement the commander in chief&#8217;s war time orders Bush&#8217;s policies.</p>
<p>Joe Galloways said:</p>
<p>“If you aren&#8217;t prepared to invest your son or daughter in continuing this war, then it&#8217;s time for you to give some serious thought to how and when it can be ended, and what the candidates for president in 2008 are saying about an open-ended commitment of other Americans&#8217; sons and daughters to a war we can&#8217;t afford and can&#8217;t win.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the outcome of this &#8220;war&#8221; is so critical, the pay off so necessary then invest your kids.  For the duration.</p>
<p>No deferments, no daddy getting the kids off, national guard service is okay since they get rotated in,  and no student deferments.</p>

                                <p>The Democratic nominee for President in 1972 has some <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-mcgovern24apr24,0,4084076.story?coll=la-opinion-center">stern words</a> for the current Vice President:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cheney said that today&#8217;s Democrats have adopted my platform from the 1972 presidential race and that, in doing so, they will raise taxes. But my platform offered a balanced budget. I proposed nothing new without a carefully defined way of paying for it. By contrast, Cheney and his team have run the national debt to an all-time high.</p></blockquote>
<p>True but I suspect what George McGovern said about the Iraq War will capture most of the headlines.  Enjoy!</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/04/24/congress.iraq.ap/index.html">Cheney</a> now attacks Senator Reid:</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8211; Vice President Dick Cheney accused Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Tuesday of pursuing a defeatest strategy in Iraq to win votes in the next election &#8211; a charge Reid said did not warrant a response.  The two sparred hours after President Bush said he will veto the latest war spending bill taking shape in Congress, which includes a timetable for withdrawing from Iraq.  Cheney, after attending the weekly Republican policy lunch on Capitol Hill, lashed out at Reid. &#8220;Some Democratic leaders seem to believe that blind opposition to the new strategy in Iraq is good politics,&#8221; Cheney said. &#8220;Sen. Reid himself has said that the war in Iraq will bring his party more seats in the next election. &#8220;It is cynical to declare that the war is lost because you believe it gives you political advantage,&#8221; Cheney said. Reid, D-Nevada, dismissed Cheney&#8217;s remarks later to reporters, but not before getting in his own dig at the vice president. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to get into a name calling match with the administration&#8217;s chief attack dog,&#8221; Reid said.</p></blockquote>
<p>What new strategy?  But the Vice President definitely understands how war can be good politics.  Winning the 2002 and 2004 elections seemed to have been the real goal behind their disastrous decision to start this stupid war.  AND they paid for this war – with a tax cut!  Pathetic!</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://www.dailytidings.com/2007/0414/stories/0414_nation_cheney.php">Peter Baker </a> covered the remarks from Dick Cheney that riled up George McGovern:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vice President Dick Cheney accused congressional Democrats today of reviving the &#8220;far-left platform&#8221; of George McGovern from the 1970s, an agenda that he said would raise taxes, declare surrender in an overseas war and leave the United States exposed to new dangers. In a sharp-edged speech, Cheney escalated the Bush administration attack on Congress for passing war spending legislation that would mandate withdrawing at least some U.S. troops from Iraq. He raised the specter of the end of the Vietnam era, when McGovern, then a Democratic senator from South Dakota, ran for president on a peace platform and lost the 1972 election in a landslide to President Nixon.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Dick Cheney forgets that Nixon pulled us out of Vietnam soon after winning re-election.  Too bad George W. Bush did not have the same wisdom in 2005.  But check this dishonesty from dead-eye Dick:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cheney asserted that Democrats want to impose &#8220;the largest tax increase in American history&#8221; and have already &#8220;earned a place in the big-spending hall of fame.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh golly gee – and I thought Dennis Hastert had been Speaker of the House for the first six years of the Bush Administration!</p>
