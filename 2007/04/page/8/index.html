                                <p>Here&#8217;s a little fun one for you. Should pets, in this case dogs, be tax deductible like children? That&#8217;s right. From Congress.org a person comes up with this<a href="http://www.congress.org/congressorg/bio/userletter/?id=10902&#038;letter_id=1131277326"> proposal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>My husband &#038; I have no children because we cannot afford to have children living on Long Island. But we do have 2 dogs &#8211; 2 very expensive dogs &#8211; and they are our kids.  If I should mistreat, neglect, abuse or deprive my dog of health care in any way, I can be arrested for animal cruelty. But yet, here we are, spending thousands and thousands of dollars each year giving my dogs the best care in emergency and non emergency situations, what do we receive? My proposal is to be able to declare my dogs as dependents on my taxes at the end of the year. </p></blockquote>
<p>Just to put this in perspective, <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p25-1129.pdf">page 13</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The number of families with children under 18 is projected to increase minimally from 32.6 million in 1995, peak at 33.2 million in 2001, and then slowly decrease to 32.2 by 2010</p></blockquote>
<p>Google Answer<a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=439417"> presents</a>:<br />
<blockquote>New figures just released from APPMA’s 2005-2006 National PetOwners Survey (NPOS) show pet ownership is currently at its highest level, with 63 percent of all U.S. households owning a pet which equates to more than 69 million households. That’s up from 64 million in 2002 and 51 million in 1988 when APPMA’s tracking began.</p></blockquote>
<p>There seems something odd about these numbers for a nation that professes to be pro children.</p>

Cheap labor is a good starting point.  But the Ex-GF has a cheap silver pendant with a cactus on it, picked up while driving around the Southwest.  On the back, it says &#8220;Made in Holland.&#8221; </p>
<p>Holland is not the last country I&#8217;d have picked as the location of that pendant, but its close.  I wonder how that happened.</p>

                                <p>I wonder when Victor Davis Hanson, a classical Greek scholar will relate how the Athenians and other Hellenes financed their war machines?</p>
<p>“The Trireme (Greek triremes) was the &#8220;state of the art&#8221; fighting ship designed to be able to cover long distances quickly under oar and sail, and in battle to ram enemy ships with devastating effect.”</p>
<p>The Trireme is about the same as an aircraft carrier and support.  If you buy the navy ship building lobby’s line.</p>
<p>For the Athenians “money from the <a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~loxias/silvermines.htm">new vein of silver in Laurion</a> enabled Athens to buy timber from Italy to increase her fleet from 40 in 489 BC to 200 in 480. The polis paid for the ship and its crew: equipment and repairs were paid for by a rich citizen as one of the liturgies (trierarchia &#8211; a brilliant Athenian notion which shamed the richest citizens into spending their wealth on the city, without the need for taxation). A full-scale replica of a trireme was launched in 1987…………”</p>
<p>So why don’t we apply a “trierachia” to all the companies making money on the oil and Pacific rim trade?</p>
<p>Why use payroll tax surpluses?</p>

A recent post by <a href="http://www.namedevelopment.com/blog/archives/2007/04/does_being_made.html">William Lozito at NameWire</a> linked to mine &#8211; it discusses Chinese exports and the increasing intangible value associated with the &#8220;Made in China&#8221; label. </p>
<p>A few quotes from his post:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The recent news that China has surpassed the US as the world’s <a href="http://www.namedevelopment.com/blog/archives/2007/04/does_being_made.html">second largest exporter</a> </p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>An Asian Times Online article <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/ID14Cb02.html">&#8220;China’s Global Luxury Brand Workshop&#8221;</a> notes that high end luxury brand names like Prada, Armani and Burberry are outsourcing to China.</p>
<p>By 2009, 60% of the world’s luxury brand will have their products made there.</p></blockquote>
<p>I understand that at one point, &#8220;Made in Japan&#8221; was a term of derision. And NamedWire had another post, recently, discussing the improvement in quality (and reputation) <a href="http://www.namedevelopment.com/blog/archives/2007/04/new_luxury_bran.html">of Hyundai vehicles</a>.   Reputations aren&#8217;t forever.  It wasn&#8217;t that long ago that some on the right were talking about GW as being Mount Rushmore material.</p>

<blockquote><p>In honor of April 15 and the delights of paying taxes, I thought I&#8217;d post some simple figures from the <a href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/mts/10-11-06-Budget-Results.pdf">Treasury Department&#8217;s</a> figures for FY 2006. All figures are in billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Total Receipts: 2,407<br />Total Outlays: 2654<br />Total Deficit: 248</p>
<p>Total Spent On Debt Service: 405.9</p>
<p>&#8212; Yes, that&#8217;s right: had we simply paid our bills on time, more or less, we would not only not be running a deficit, we would have $157.9 billion dollars to either refund to taxpayers or spend on some new program.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Debt Service as a percentage of receipts: 16.9%</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right too: about one in every six dollars that we pay in taxes goes to pay not for anything useful, like fixing bridges, but for debt service.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few minor quibbles&#8230; the deficit figure is the figure including the Social Security surplus. The other thing is&#8230; the interest on the debt is not just a matter of us paying our bills on time &#8211; its a matter of us previously paying our bills on time. Put another way&#8230; the interest we&#8217;re paying now is a consequence, in part, of Reagan&#8217;s deficits as far as the eye can see. Those who whine about taxes &#8211; get used to it. You&#8217;ll be paying a lot more because GW cut tax rates and increased spending back in 2001.</p>

<blockquote><p>During those conversations, <strong>to my knowledge</strong>, I did not make decisions about who should or should not be asked to resign.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Highlights by TBogg)</p>
<p>Now, I personally tend to forget things, even from day to day, but considering this is shaping up to be a very big scandal, shouldn&#8217;t he have found out by now whether he was or wasn&#8217;t running the Justice Department.  As TBogg says, the guy reall has no idea what&#8217;s going to come out in the next document dump.  Why he didn&#8217;t just quote Reagan I don&#8217;t know.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;m not even sure this is economics&#8230; just an observation.  Probably not a useful one either.  But its something I was thinking about.</p>
<p>I was driving home the other day and noted a small billboard for Skechers shoes.  A young pretty blond girl was featured on the billboard.   She is Ashlee Simpson.  I know this because the billboard also told me who she was.</p>
<p>Now, I am not so out of touch with what&#8217;s hot among the teen age crowd that I don&#8217;t konw who Ashlee Simpson is.  I understand that she&#8217;s a a singer whose primary claim to fame is being Jessica Simpson&#8217;s sister.  I believe her second biggest claim to fame is that she was caught lip-syncing on what was supposed to be a live performance.  And that more or less is the sum total of what information my brain is able to dredge up about Ashlee Simpson.</p>
<p>Now I understand that if they had a picture of an athlete, it might make sense to tell us who that athlete is.  After all, I may not know who some rock climber or tennis player or basketball player might be, but I do know that these people need good shoes.  While I understand that product endorsement is a funny thing &#8211; the athlete may wear a custom made model, not the one you find in stores &#8211; its not unreasonable to expect that many people might be swayed by the fact that an athlete is endorsing a shoe.</p>
<p>But Ashlee Simpson?  I suppose if she wears a shoe, it might make the shoe cool for some segment of the population.  But I also assume that segment of the population can recognize Ahslee Simpson in a photo if they see it.  I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if folks who wear Skechers are also folks that can recognize Ashlee Simpson.  So why does Skechers feel the need to tell us the person on the billboard is Ashlee Simpson?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>So…what’s with cheap labor in China? Take Shenzhen SEZ, Special Economics Zone. Minimum wage here is 4.66 yuan/ hour or $ 0.60/hour.</p>
<p>A SEZ is an area often designed to attract foreign investment. And so it has in Shenzen SEZ. For an overview of some of the working conditions, see <a href="http://www.coxwashington.com/news/content/reporters/stories/2007/02/04/BC_CHINA_LABOR04_COX.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Often, living quarters are deducted from pay. For example, in the article linked above, workers at Foxconn, worked 60 hours a week and receive $32, for which they get a bunk bed in a dorm that they share with 19 other workers. By my reckoning, they are paying $4/week for the bunk. Foxconn, by the way, churns out Ipods for Apple.</p>
<p>Now, those who defend this side of globalization often tell us how wonderful these people must feel to be making 60 cents an hour, working 60 hours a week, with 2 ten minute coffee breaks each day. Oh, and those two breaks are the only time in which they are allowed to talk to one another? And those dorms must be a stupendous improvement over rural living conditions.</p>
<p>As we all know, or should now, China’s lone labor union is government run. And China is not particularly known for protecting its masses. Now that money is at stake, it will be less and less so. And I have not even begun to list the kinds of labor abuses the communist, Chinese regime tolerates. Overtime pay? Working conditions?</p>
<p>Next time you buy an Ipod, ask if it is true that labor costs were .60/hour.</p>
<p>I was going to write an article about a Fed report <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/06/07/Kotlikoff.pdf">Is the U.S. Bankrupt?</a> Bankrupt it may be and most probably is, but morally bankrupt are its corporations and leaders and globalization policy.</p>
<p>In defense of my wild-eyed scream of protest, I tender the following from the Fed report:</p>
<blockquote><p>What’s more, the major outflow of the developed world’s capital to China predicted in the short run by our model does not come at the cost of lower wages in the developed world. The reason is that the knowledge that their future wages will be higher (thanks to China’s future capital accumulation) leads our model’s workers to cut back on their current labor supply. So the short-run outflow of capital to China is met with a commensurate short-run reduction in developed-world labor supply…<br />Doing so could well show that trade with China, at least in the short run, explains much of the relative decline in the wages of low-skilled workers in the developed world. Hence, we don’t mean to suggest here that all United States, European Union, and Japanese workers are being helped by trade with China, but rather that trade with China is, on average, raising the wages of developed-world workers and will continue to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>[Embolding mine]</p>
<p>Sooo&#8230;.the outflow of capital from Western companies to China, FDI, does not come at no cost. Remember how delighted economists and capital was over China&#8217;s entry into the WTO? Ahhh&#8230;.free trade. The writer knows there is a hitch. Watch how he handles it. Read carefully his last sentence.</p>
<p>When I read that last sentence, I found it confusing at first. “Is on average?” “Will?” Funny shift going on there, hiding the real problem. Whose wages are being raised or will be raised? And how? Do we have to wait for China’s sole labor union to pump for higher wages and better working conditions? You mean to tell me, that our entire economic future is contingent on one governmental labor union?</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, the Chinese government will stay only one step ahead of the riots. Any changes to working conditions or minimum wage will come only when real unrest occurs. Anyone who thinks differently…you fill in the blanks. And I remind you: Shenzhen SEZ, is not some out of the way spot with no government eyes watching.</p>
<p>I want to return a minute to that Fed report. Below are the solutions to our 65 trillion dollar debt that this report recommends:.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate social security “at the margin by paying in the future only those retirement benefits that were accrued at the time of the reform.”</li>
<li>Institute a medical voucher system for all citizens, based on their age and health. Those vouchers could be used to purchase health insurance for the following year. (Keep the insurance companies. Chuckle.)</li>
<li>Institute a 33% sales tax, replacing corporate taxes, personal income taxes, estate and gift taxes. Use a rebate for the poor so that in effect they would have no sales tax. Ok…when do they get the rebate? After or before they starve? Or do we give them poverty cards</li>
<li>Continue to tap Chinese productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, you read that last bullet correctly: China’s productivity is our savior; it is part of the plan to deliver us from our 65 trillion dollar debt. Is the writer of this report asking us to continue investing in China, moving our factories and skills there for the sake of productivity? Shall we move everything, including our research labs? If you ask me, continued investment in China is part of the reason for our 65 trillion dollar debt. Cheap labor has its costs, here and now, as well as in China.</p>
<p>Less someone accuse me of misrepresenting the Fed report, let me provide some of the ways that the report says China can help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chna can serve as America’s saver and, consequently, savior, provided the U.S. government lets growth outpace its spending and provided China is permitted to invest massive sums in our country. [I.e., Unocal. Maybe they would like a thruway?]</li>
<li>If successive Chinese cohorts continue to save like current cohorts, if the Chinese government can restrain growth in expenditures, and if Chinese technology and education levels ultimately catch up with those of the West and Japan, the model looks much brighter in the long run. China eventually becomes the world’s saver and, thereby, the developed world’s savior with respect to its long-run supply of capital and long-run general equilibrium prospects. And, rather than seeing the real wage per unit of human capital fall, the West and Japan see it rise by one-fifth by 2030 and by three-fifths by 2100. These wage increases are over and above those associated with technical progress, which we model as increasing the human capital endowments of successive cohorts.</li>
</ul>
<p>So many &#8220;if&#8217;s.&#8221; By 2030, wages will rise one-fifth? Three-fifths by 2100? Inflation adjusted? What I want to know is: In China, have wages increased as a share of GDP?</p>
<p>If you ask me: America is broken&#8230;and with it all the globalization models. We sold our trade policy to the WTO and to corporations, whose profits, by the way, take down an increasingly larger share of our GDP. Labor arbitrage is the name of the game that is being played…and played with Fed approval. America will pay a price for this arbitrage; already is paying a price for it. And I have not even mentioned the tax and environmental arbitrage that China offers.</p>
<p>Next time you buy an Ipod, ask that question: Is it true that sweatshop labor made this thing? Enjoy.</p>

<p>Let me give a little credit to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/13/AR2007041302088.html">Kevin Hassett</a> for this:</p>
<blockquote><p>What about those who do pay taxes? To analyze them more carefully, I turned to the U.S. Department of Labor&#8217;s Consumer Expenditure Survey, which contains data on household expenditures, as well as on income and taxes for a large sample of Americans. Using it as a base, I calculated the average taxes paid (including federal and state income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes and federal payroll taxes) for typical families and compared that, for context, to the other things these families spent money on. The accompanying chart contains the calculations for two scenarios &#8211; a family of four with an income of $50,000, and a family of four with an income of $150,000. The chart shows the average total taxes paid and average expenditures for two years, 1983 and 2003 (the last year for which data are available). Looking first at the average American family with a $50,000 income, a couple of things jump out. First, even though the family has a relatively low income, the amount of money it paid in taxes at all levels was strikingly high in both years. In 1983, it paid 29 percent of income in taxes. In 2003, it paid 31 percent … Looking now at the family with the $150,000 income, taxes are once again the No. 1 item in the household budget in both years. In 1983, the government&#8217;s take was 30 percent, compared with 23.7 percent spent on the next biggest item, the family&#8217;s home. In 2003, the take was 30 percent, compared with 23.5 percent going into the home … Government thus takes more from the wealthy through income taxes, but extracts more from the poor with all the other taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me get this straight.  We have a conservative saying that while a lower middle class family was paying slightly less in total taxes than an upper middle class family back in 1983, they are now paying slightly more!  Kevin does do his conservative bit with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Government has been robbing Peter to pay Peter … Which must mean that 30 percent is something of a magic number. In fact, a recent review of polls by my colleague Karlyn Bowman found that &#8220;people think Americans should not pay more than 25 percent of their total income in taxes.&#8221; If you consider that payroll taxes that go into Social Security deliver future benefits and so may not be fully thought of as a tax, then the amount that government raises from citizens seems to be a little less than the amount they tend to think is fair.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conservatives are about to scream at me and at Kevin as this was supposed to be rob Peter to pay Paul, but Kevin admits that much of the tax/transfer system is paying for Social Security retirement.  So to protect Kevin from the lynch mobs of rightwingers, let’s back up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today taxes eat up about 30 percent of income, a much heavier burden. And like our ancestors, we don&#8217;t believe that our money is particularly well spent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Heavier than what?  Oh – a larger tax burden than during the eighteenth century.  But as we look at spending relative to GDP – it has been running at 31% of GDP since 1975.  So if taxes are only 30% of GDP or less – then we’ll see mounting government debt.  Kevin may not like the fact that spending is 31% of GDP as compared to say 25% of GDP that we saw back in 1961 (never mind some Karlyn Bowman poll) but the increase mainly represent an increase in transfer payments such as Social Security benefits and government funding health care.  I wonder if Karlyn Bowman has some poll that says people want those slashed.</p>

                                <p>I have tried to stay away from this mess, but like <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/coda-by-digby-i-missed-this-one-from.html">Digby</a>, I watched Tony Blankley outdo his usual stupidity on the McLaughlin Report.  But Digby missed the worse part:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the McLaughlin Report last night Tony Blankley repeatedly brought up the fact that &#8220;liberals&#8221; say horrible things about President Bush and Dick Cheney as a corollary to the Imus matter. To any sentient person, this is ridiculous, and Blankley is a total partisan so his views are tainted.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, this was as pathetic as Digby suggests.  But when one of the sane members of the show said Imus was pulled because the sponsors told CBS they’d lose revenues, Blankey decided to compare Don Imus to Edward R. Murrow.  OK, there was some concern that the March 19, 1954 show that entitled “A Report on Senator Joseph McCarthy” would be controversial.  But this show was real journalism at its best.  What Don Imus said about those young women on the Rutgers basketball team was simply put – juvenile.  For Blankey to equate Don Imus with Edward R. Murrow was simply put – stupid.</p>
