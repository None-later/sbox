                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>On March 16, China enacted a sweeping new <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/china_law_prof_blog/files/070316_enterprise_income_tax_law.pdf">tax law</a> , bringing foreign-invested enterprises (FIE&#8217;s) more in line with domestic firms.</p>
<p>As some readers may know, I have complained about various kinds of arbitrage that China offers: tax, labor, and environmental. Prior to the law, domestic firms were at distinct disadvantage vis-à-vis foreign firms. Domestic firms were taxed at 25-30%, whereas foreign firms were taxed at 15%. In some cased, foreign firms enjoyed no taxation. Tax, together with environmental and labor arbitrage, enticed many western firms to relocate to China, putting pressure on western countries to lower tax rates and wages and environmental regulations.</p>
<p>Below are some highlights of the new law:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>One standard rate of 25% for both indigenous and foreign firms</li>
<li>Foreign firms presently taxed at the lower rate are protected for five years, during which time their tax rates will slowly be adjusted to the new 25% rate.</li>
<li>“State-encourage high and new technology enterprises established within special zones …may continue to transitional tax treatment.”</li>
<li>“…enterprises that have yet to enjoy preferential treatment due to their failure to make any profits, the preferential treatment period shall commence from the year this Law becomes effective”</li>
<li>New law effective January 1, 2008.</li>
</ul>
<p>Commenting on the new law, the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/20/12/38309228.pdf">OECD</a> observed:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>China will incur a revenue loss of 93 billion. Foreign firms will generate 41 billion more; domestic firms, 134 billion less.</li>
<li>Round-tripping will decrease. Round-tripping occurs when Chinese capital goes abroad, sets up a bogus foreign firm, then sets up a “foreign firm” inside China. For a more exact and nuanced description, see <a href="http://adbi.adb.org/files/2004.06.dp7.foreign.direct.investment.people.rep.china.implications.pdf">here</a>.</li>
<li>Special Economic Zones will continue to enjoy preferential treatment, for they do not discriminate between foreign and domestic firms.</li>
<li>Tax avoidance, including transfer pricing, will be discouraged.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before commenting on the implications, let me point out that according to the OECD foreign firms paid 795 billion in all types of taxes, “representing 21.1% of total national tax revenue.” That, my friends, is a healthy sum. China uses that money, of course, to buy T-bills so that we can continue the consumption of goods our firms make in China&#8211;a delicious circle. In short, our debt (loss of taxes) and our wage loss (together with the multiplier effect) are part of the profits our companies are now enjoying. The stock market booms. <i>There is a direct link between that “stock market boom” and our debt, both public and private.</i> China is only part of the story. In many developing nations the story is the same.</p>
<p>Some implications:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Because foreign firms account for almost 60% of China’s exports, expect some additional inflationary pressures in 2008, increasing thereafter during the transitional period as grandfathering expires. And what will the Fed do then?</li>
<li>Expect also an increased rush to China on the part of firms wishing to be grandfathered.</li>
<li>Expect no changes in SEZ’s. (Remember where the iPod comes from.)</li>
<li>Expect China to continue to use taxes as a lure to new technology. Its climb up this ladder will continue. I would expect more and more research centers to leave the U.S. Taxes and proximity to manufacturing will lure them. China is intent on becoming a complete market—not merely an assembly plant. I have no quarrel with its motives; they are natural enough. I continue to have a beef with its labor and environmental standards, and I do have a beef with our mnc’s and our government that sees this entire process as a good one. Do we have a trade policy?</li>
<li>I should add that Chinese attempts to change international standards vis-à-vis technology will continue to meet sturdy resistance, at least for a while. If and when this resistance melts, we will know we are in trouble.</li>
</ul>
<p>How does the U.S. meet this challenge? Vouchers for education and health care? Reduce corporate taxes? Reduce labor standards in our own SEZ&#8217;s?</p>
<p>There is one OECD quotation in the above piece that hits the target: “for they [SEZ&#8217;s] do not discriminate between foreign and domestic firms.” That clause describes the heart of WTO. Now, consider, the iPod is made in a SEZ at .60/hour under sweatshop conditions. (See my April 15 post, &#8220;China&#8217;s Cheap labor: It&#8217;s part of the solution to our 65 trillion dollar debt&#8221; for a more complete description.) The WTO pays little heed to sweatshop brutalities precisely because those brutalities do not discriminate between foreign and domestic firms. The same logic holds true for environmental regulations.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a person to do? Complain to your local WTO.</p>
<p>And please, no one tell me to visit the IFO. It&#8217;s useless. The WTO has all the cards.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>SLOW BLEED</strong>&#8230;.Remember &#8220;As the Iraqis stand up, we will stand down&#8221;? <a href="http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/17104704.htm">Apparently that&#8217;s no longer operative</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Military planners have abandoned the idea that standing up Iraqi troops will enable American soldiers to start coming home soon and now believe that U.S. troops will have to defeat the insurgents and secure control of troubled provinces.</p>
<p>Training Iraqi troops, which had been the cornerstone of the Bush administration&#8217;s Iraq policy since 2005, has dropped in priority, officials in Baghdad and Washington said.</p></blockquote>
<p>So we&#8217;re going to defeat the insurgency without significant help from Iraqi troops?</p></blockquote>
<p>I remember writing, before the surge began, that unfortunately it wasn&#8217;t going to work. I also remember noting that there is a big difference between Iraq and Vietnam: in Vietnam, our allies wouldn&#8217;t actually shoot American troops if they thought they could get away with it, which makes training our, um, allies in Iraq problematic at best. If there is a solution, and after driving the car onto the rocks its kind of doubtful, this administration is not capable of finding or executing it. Staying on is just delaying the inevitable.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Since we’ve been discussing health care, I want to quote something reader Sebastian Holsclaw posted in comments</p>
<blockquote><p>You should also note that what you normally think of as marketing (the advertising side) is less than 20% of the total promotions. Most of the rest is spent on samples and &#8216;explanatory&#8217; advertising in medical journals. That at least is much more defensible than the consumer advertising&#8211;which frankly if we wanted to make illegal again I wouldn&#8217;t cry about it at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, when you hear about promotions, you&#8217;re probably thinking the free samples and pens that companies give doctors.  You might think to yourself:  wow, that&#8217;s an awful lot of pens.  Maybe you&#8217;re even thinking of free meals, and you wonder what kind of barbecues they might be thrown in.  </p>
<p>OK.  Now a digression while I meander toward the point.  Bear with me&#8230;  Regular readers know I used to be an adjunct professor at a business school for about five years.  It was a lot of fun, and I’m glad I did it.  I’ve kept in touch with a lot of former students.  In fact, for the gossip-hounds, I should note that the Ex-GF is a former student, but that’s another story (and for the gossip-hounds, completely unrelated with the fact that I don’t teach any more).  </p>
<p>After reading Sebastian Holsclaw&#8217;s comments, I thought about something a former student told me over dinner a few months ago.  He lives abroad, and is kind of in charge of foreign sales for a rather expensive medical, well, let&#8217;s call it a a product.  (For reasons that will become obvious, I&#8217;m not going to provide any information that would identify the product.)  I believe there are only three companies that manufacture these items, and my former student has worked for two of them, and the job is done the same way at both of these companies.  Presumably, the third company is no different.  </p>
<p>Every four to six months or so, my former student flies to the US.  The company also flies in a bunch of doctors that use (or are considering using) the product for a few days of, well, its called “training.”  Now, many of these doctors have been using the equipment for years, and really don’t need a week of training in the US.  Perhaps there are some new features to see, and a good fifteen minutes is enough to get across the changes.</p>
<p>So what do they during the rest of time?  Well, some of the doctors really like golf… arrangements are made at Pebble Beach.  Perhaps one of them wants to see the Grand Canyon…  and a small plane is chartered.  Every few months another batches of doctors flies in, and while the company won’t provide them with hookers or drugs, otherwise it makes sure they leave very, very happy.  I’ll have to remember to ask him what they do for the American doctors next time around.</p>
<p>In any case, it goes without saying that this process falls under providing samples, training, and providing samples to doctors.  And of course, it would never influence doctors to suggest a course of treatment for clients, I mean, patients, that is unwarranted.  Training simply is intended to produce better doctors.</p>
<p>So when someone tells you that non-advertising promotional expenses and training are some of the biggest expenses that the pharma/health industry has, I suggest you believe it.  And apropos of nothing, this is one of those pieces of equipment that doesn’t get used as often abroad as it does here in the US.  In fact, there are plenty of instances of wealthy patients flying to the US for the procedure with which this piece of equipment is associated; the procedure is performed so much more frequently here in the US that the best experts are here.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>We’ve had some posts lately (as have Kevin Drum, Ezra Klein, Matthew Yglesias and others) on healthcare.  One point that keeps coming up from the right is that a single payer system will stifle innovation.  I would like to offer a counterpoint – I believe that the current system also stifles innovation.  </p>
<p>Let’s take an example.  For generations, people have believed that saw palmetto could be helpful for keeping prostate problems at bay.  That’s recently been put to the test.  A recent study by Kaiser found that saw palmetto is <br /><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/02/060213102419.htm">no better than a placebo</a> in treating enlarged prostates.  A Danish study found that saw palmetto might have<a href="http://www.ffnmag.com/NH/ASP/strArticleID/1118/strSite/FFNSite/articleDisplay.asp">deleterious health effects</a>.  The New England Journal of Medicine published a study in 2002 noting that <a href="http://www.herbalgram.org/default.asp?c=sawpalmBPH">two and a half million men</a> in this country were taking saw palmetto.</p>
<p>So the efficacy of the stuff, and whether or not it could cause problems, is a key issue.  And yet it took this long for there to be a serious study with a reasonable scale on whether its effective, and only the Danes have looked at whether it might be harmful.  This should be something the US is all over – saw palmetto grows in Florida, after all.  I’m pretty sure it doesn’t grow in Denmark.</p>
<p>So what’s going on?  What’s going on is that saw palmetto can’t be patented.  So nobody except a not-for-profit has any incentive to do any research on it.  And nobody has any incentive to lobby the NIH to do research on it, so it goes to the back of the pile, behind stuff that industry does want studied.  As to people who might benefit from it:  screw them.  As to people who might get hurt:  screw them.  </p>
<p>Now, its not just saw palmetto and prostate problems.  Maybe aspirin is good for something that nobody hasn’t thought of.  Or penicillin.  Or chili peppers, or lemons, or some herbal remedy.  Who knows?  But as long as big pharma makes a profit off of drugs, and as long as big pharma’s lobbying is what determines the direction of NIH research, if you want to know whether something is useful or harmful or whatnot, you’re either out of luck, or you have done to track down research done far, far away that doesn’t get publicized at all over here.</p>

                                <p>While we&#8217;ve had a few posts at Angry Bear that touch on health care lately, Ezra Klein has been particularly busy on the subject with four medical related posts just yesterday.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s from <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/04/more_on_medical.html">one of them</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www2.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0705.longman.html">This bit</a>from Phil Longman&#8217;s review of Jon Cohn&#8217;s book seems germane to the question of whether low-cost, socialized systems can innovate: </p>
<blockquote><p>[This] system’s innovations have included the development of the first artificial kidney, the cardiac pacemaker, the first successful liver transplant, and the nicotine patch, plus many advanced prosthetic devices, including hydraulic knees and robotic arms.</p></blockquote>
<p>The system in question? Why, the government-run, fully socialized, Veteran&#8217;s Health Administration! </p></blockquote>
<p>In other words&#8230; sure, the VHA can innovate.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/04/canada_vs_ameri.html">Another post</a>, he looks at a recent study comparing the costs of healthcare in Canada versus the costs of healthcare in the US:</p>
<blockquote><p>[O]f the 38 studies examined, 14 showed clear advantaged for Canadian patients, five suggested US care was superior, and the remainder were mixed. The studies showing the Canadian systems superiority found effects both on income &#8212; low-income Americans with breast or prostate cancer do much worse than low-income Canadians with the same conditions &#8212; and care effectiveness. </p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not that the data shows <em>unbelievable</em> advantages for Canada, to be sure. As the authors conclude, &#8220;although Canadian outcomes were more often superior to US outcomes than the reverse, neither the United States nor Canada can claim hegemony in terms of quality of medical care and the resultant patient-important outcomes.&#8221; The question raised is slightly different: How can we possibly countenance a system that costs twice as much as the Canadian system but delivers slightly worse care?</p></blockquote>
<p>I also want to quote from a semi-kinda-medically-ish <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/04/no_abstinence_f.html">post</a> he has on abstinence&#8230;.  ah heck, this one I&#8217;m going to steal whole&#8230;</p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Family Research Council: We need more failed abstinence programs.&#8221; That, at least, is how Think progress characterizes this. </p>
<blockquote><p>The latest federal report on abstinence-only programs shows that they have had “no impacts on rates of sexual abstinence.” Nevertheless, the conservative Family Research Council responds that “one logical conclusion is that to achieve the greatest effectiveness, programs must be intensive and long-term, so that the knowledge, attitudes, and skills needed to reject sex before marriage are constantly reinforced–particularly in the pivotal high school years.” </p></blockquote>
<p>That our programs don&#8217;t work merely demonstrates the need for our programs. </p></blockquote>
<p>I think I keep hearing the same argument &#8211; &#8220;clap louder&#8221; &#8211; in favor of more tax cuts and the quagmire in Iraq.</p>

                                <p>Single buyer does not need to mean no innovation.</p>
<p>The NIH spends a lot of money on basic research over many researchers, and it is seemingly doing well.</p>
<p>A bit of background which may help explain how innovation is done in DoD.</p>
<p>The congress appropriates research and development money for DoD to pursue innovation, that is stay ahead of adversaries with new mission capacity and do the missions we already do cheaper or better.  R&#038;D money is broken up into at least 6 sequential ‘buckets’.  The first bucket is spent on things that advance basic knowledge, the next bucket may develop a function that the knowledge or ideas make possible to do, like fly around invisible to radar, then the next bucket develops a prototype, then you may expand the prototype to work in some environmental conditions.   Do some tests and see what you can expect to do in terms of performance and cost.  Some technology money goes to developing manufacturing and repair capacity as well.</p>
<p>Once you have gotten the innovation to the point where you have run some tests on a physical and SW enabled model you write a development specification for industry to use to take the ideas as somewhat mature technology and make a product that could do the job at a reasonably estimated cost to make and operate.  Here is where the conspiracy of hope and need to keep industry busy breaks down the logical process.</p>
<p>Developing and testing the product is paid for with the 5th and 6th buckets of the R&#038;D appropriation.</p>
<p>When the tests pass (conspiracy of hope is a problem here at DoD) then you get production appropriation money to make the product and test it with the operator in their hands in the real world.</p>
<p>If that test is &#8220;good&#8221;, almost always because the congress now sees profits, the system goes into production and is fielded.</p>
<p>NIH already pays for at least the first couple of innovative R&#038;D steps. </p>
<p>Like in early stage DoD R&#038;D, this money goes to basic research at universities and some private labs who writes grants to define the science and possible benefits of learning about the object studied.</p>
<p>The DoD porcess is good if run effectively and if the conspiracy of hope were ended and bad technical ventures killed when they should be.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>It was easily predictable that at the end of the housing bubble, we’d see a lot of homes getting foreclosed.  But there is nothing inherent in the end of a bubble that requires vast numbers of foreclosures.  The reason we see them is that lenders made imprudent loans, and of course, that many people took those imprudent loans.</p>
<p>Regular readers may recall that I mentioned growing up in South America in the 1970s and 1980s, when much of the continent was going through high inflation.  The high inflation itself was caused in large part by massive foreign debt, which consumed much of South American tax revenue, meaning those revenues couldn’t get used to pay for other things – roads, teachers salaries, or even soldiers.  And since the latter, at least, have to be paid no matter what (or the government falls), well, it makes printing money look a bit more attractive.</p>
<p>So how did South American countries get into debt?  Well, big American (and they were mostly American) banks loaned them lots of money.  And loaning “them” money was easy – “them” were basically dictators who were happy to take the money.  This was because with no checks and balances (one of the cool features of being a dictator), the money could then turn around and be deposited (often in the same bank that made the loan), this time in the accounts of the dictator, his kids, his mistress, etc.  </p>
<p>So Brazil or Argentina or wherever would borrow a few billion to build a road, but the road would never get built because the money would never be used to build a road.  The economic development that the road was supposed to foster would never occur, and thus neither would the extra tax revenue, and thus, the money to pay back the loans would never materialize.</p>
<p>But this went on for decades.  So why did the big American banks make these loans?  The answer is simple – they didn’t.  Individuals in the banks made these loans.  They got promoted for making loans.  Twenty years later, when the loan came due and wasn’t paid – well, the guy who got promoted for making the loan wasn’t in the same job any more.  He might not even be with the company any more.  If he was with the company, he’d be much higher up – too high up to pay a price, even if he somehow was associated with the loan he originally made.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with foreclosing homes these days?  Everything, I think.</p>

<p>The novel move was opposed for various reasons. While I would support Britain&#8217;s argument that global warming may well lead to wars, I am not sure exactly what I think about making the Security Council chew on it.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: Britain&#8217;s move, even if it is denied, elevates the importance of global warming and brings to the fore another aspect of its dangerous consequences.</p>

                                <p>Fellow Angry Bear Save the Rustbelt has a nice post on making the transition to a single payer system in healthcare.  One objection that always comes up from the right comes in comments courtesy of reader Sebastian Holsclaw:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;a plan where no one is allowed to buy better care than the national health plan and is suggesting a fiat cut in drug prices. That is absolutely going to stifle medical advancement.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was wondering about this point.  I hear it a lot.  But most of the folks on the right who make this point will point with pride at the American military-industrial complex (to use Ike&#8217;s term).  They will note that American military equipment is often the best there is (Fellow Angry Bear ILSM has been writing posts about whether they are as good or inexpensive as they should be and I&#8217;ll leave that question to him).  </p>
<p>Anyway&#8230; why is it that a monopsony buyer of military equipment, a buyer that puts its suppliers on a cost-plus arrangement most of the time, hasn&#8217;t managed to kill off innovation in military equipment but a monopsony buyer of health care would strangle all medical advance forever more?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I have spent about 20 years studying most of the healthcare reform ideas floated in the U.S.. I look at the proposals primarily as a technical expert, but secondarily for political feasibility (this is my 30th year of working with Medicare and Medicaid, do I get a cake or something?).</p>
<p>It is my studied opinion that in a single payer system physicians will take a 30% hit in pay and benefits. This is after factoring in savings from simplifying the billing function, a huge expense in physician practices. Billing will still require a substantial investment in technology and staff.</p>
<p>The 30% is a rough average estimate and obviously some specialties will take a bigger percentage hit, others less. I think family practitioners will take a lesser percentage hit, but they are already on the low end of the pay spectrum so this will be painful. This is relevant because we need more family practitioners (and internists and gerontologists), and they work ridiculous hours (including call coverage).</p>
<p>So what are the ramifications?</p>
<p>Physicians will be happy if the billing function is simplified, but extremely unhappy about taking a pay cut. Younger physicians are fighting student loans and the opportunity costs of getting established (young docs rarely start new practices these days, the entry cost is too high and the initial cash flow too slow). Older docs have income expectations and retirement ideas. Many have considerable debt associated with keeping the practice running and real estate. Some capital investments will go sour, I think there will be a lot of MRI magnets available cheap.</p>
<p>So how do we make this transition? How could we go to single payer? How do you convince your physician that taking a pay cut is for the greater good, after he/she spent 4+4+1+3 years in college and training? How do you convince the spouse, who gets to listen to the 3:00 am phone calls, that the spouse really isn’t as valuable as an annuity salesman?</p>
<p>I may be too close to the problem to look at it properly.</p>
<p>Your thoughts? Should we care?</p>
<p>More on healthcare reform in future posts.</p>
