                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Movie Guy in the first post on this subject brings up a couple of points worthy of a new post.</p>
<p>&#8220;The testing cycle hours have been very limited for the prototype testing on this vehicle. The vehicle design hasn&#8217;t been proven to be a failed design, rather the issue is improving the vehicle&#8217;s maintenance reliability. Two different issues entirely. Moreover, the unit cost per vehicle has jumped considerably in recent fiscal years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Movie guy is a good student of military acquisitions, as am I.  He shows a depth of knowledge differentiating maintenance reliability from mission reliability.  Mission reliability means the EFV gets through a mission cycle with no breakdowns.  This can be done with expensive redundancy and materials that are gold plated to be in a bengin environment.  I do not know the mission reliability of the EFV.  It may be as specified.</p>
<p>Maintenance reliability says the thing can do its missions but comes in needing maintenance on the redundancies which often must be fixed before the vehicle is sent out again, the redundancy is needed to meet its survivable, safe performance.</p>
<p>In any event achieving mission reliability with high maintenance doubles the costs of manufacture while also making support costs very high.  It also raises weight. fuel requirements and the need for Marines to be repairmen rather than rifle men.</p>
<p>It is the second part of Movie Guy&#8217; comment that needs to be dissected.</p>
<p>He states that we have not proven the vehicle to have failed.  Be that as it may, the buyer should insist the vehicle passes its test not that it needs to be double tested to prove it is a failed design.</p>
<p>This attitude is like Bush requiring that we invade Iraq to be proven wrong on WMD&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Proving a negative is very hard, and certainly if I were shepherding my money I would only buy a system which is proven to be good.</p>
<p>In terms of traditional quality testing Movie Guys approach is for zero producers risk, that is no chance that a good product will be rejected.</p>
<p>While the customer should be looking for less chance that a bad product is accepted.</p>
<p>DoD development seems to tend toward zero chance of rejecting a weapon system, and so they want to test it until it is proven bad.</p>
<p>With this approach there is never enough design money.</p>

                                <p>The folks at McClatchy, formerly Knight Ridder, really seem to have one heck of a news bureau these days&#8230;</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/news/nation/17145860.htm?source=rss&#038;channel=krwashington_nation">they&#8217;re reporting</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; A senior Justice Department official has resigned after coming under scrutiny in the Department’s expanding investigation of convicted super-lobbyist Jack Abramoff, according to a Justice Department official with knowledge of the case. </p>
<p>Making the situation more awkward for the embattled Department, the official, Robert E. Coughlin II, was deputy chief of staff for the criminal division, which is overseeing the Department’s probe of Abramoff. </p></blockquote>
<p>If you ask me, this news is rather surprising.  With this administration, I figured Coughlin would stay on at least until he finished investigating himself and his friends.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/social-security-and-medicare-outlook.html">Kash</a> read the latest from the folks at the Social Security Administration and provided us with a nice summary, which included:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the &#8220;low cost&#8221; scenario, there&#8217;s no SS problem, and even something between scenarios I and II could well result in the SS problem being a rather minor issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Contrast this to the sky is falling nonsense from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODU5M2Q2NDNhYjI4MjcyZjIwZWYxMGNjMjY1ODg1MTc">Pat Toomey</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>By the year 2017, Social Security is scheduled to pay more in benefits than it receives in tax revenue, and the trust fund is scheduled to hit empty in the year 2041. The good news is that 2041 is one year later than projected in last year’s report. The bad news? There is no trust fund.</p></blockquote>
<p>Toomey references <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR07/tr07.pdf">this document</a>, which tracks the assets in the Trust Fund that Toomey thinks does not exist.  Let’s take a look at Table III.A.3 on page 25 for the 2006 accounting.  As of 12/31/2005, total assets were $1858.66 billion and they grew to $2048.112 billion by 12/31/2006.  Tax revenues, however, only exceeded benefits by $87.031 billion so how did assets grow by $189.452.  Why yes – interest income was $102.421 billion.</p>
<p>Next let’s go to Table IV.A.3 which projects out to 2016 – the year that Toomey thinks this system goes broke.  Sure taxes exceed benefits in this intermediate scenario by only $14.7 billion but assets are expected to grow from $4209.7 billion to $4459.3 billion.  How?  Again, interest income, which is expected to be $235 billion.</p>
<p>But Toomey says this does not exist.  His lack of understanding (or complete mendacity) continues with:</p>
<blockquote><p>But for all the talk of a funding crisis, the problem with Social Security runs deeper than its insolvency. Social Security is plagued by the negative rate of return a worker receives on his contributions to Social Security. The below-market rate of return that plagues the current system will only be aggravated by any of the three aforementioned solutions … Luckily, there is a fourth option, one that tackles insolvency and offers workers a greater rate of return on their contributions. That option is personal accounts … imagine that our hypothetical worker invests the retirement portion of his payroll taxes in a bundle of stocks and bonds, earning a modest 4.9 percent return.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is he saying this portfolio will give only a 4.9% nominal return?  Currently, <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update">20-year Federal bonds</a> pay more than that.  But Toomey would not know that the bonds that go into the Trust Fund will have a rate fixed at what the market is paying on these bonds.  After all, he doesn’t even know the Trust Fund holds bonds that pay interest.  Or could Toomey be talking about real returns.  Sure a 4.9% real return beats a 2.35% real return – until one realize that the higher expected returns to stocks are simply compensation for bearing the extra market risk.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A follow-up to my question from earlier today&#8230;  one objection some people had to my point in that post is that many of the rules and regulations sites like EBay and Craigslist impose are forced on them by the government.  Ditto for other markets, such as the NASDAQ and the NYSE.</p>
<p>But that is easily remedied.  Presumably, there are many countries out there with less regulation than the US.  It doesn&#8217;t even have to be a place like Somalia&#8230; I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of island nations that would happily allow an EBay to set up and be exempt from any US laws.  (Gambling sites seem to accomplish as much by being based off-shore, but unlike gambling, its hard to see how the government would be able to show an interest in banning the use of the Tuvalo branch of EBay, if it existed, by American citizens.)</p>
<p>Similarly, an electronic stock exchange could be technically based in such a location, and would be equally immune from all the tiresome US laws and regulations, and just as equally immune from all the tiresome European and Japanese laws and regulations.  (I assume some laws still hold.  An American citizen can&#8217;t arrange for delivery of an illegal substance at their home, even if the arrangements were made abroad.  But these are relative details.)</p>
<p>Put another way&#8230; it is relatively simple and inexpensive to set up whatever is the ideal conservative and/or libertarian marketplace, be it in goods, services, shares of stock, or whatever.  Complete with buyer beware, no pesky government interference (either regulation or protection), and the like.  And given the large number of believers, presumably there would be no lack of buyers and sellers to flock to those relatively regulation-less markets.</p>
<p>So where are these markets?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211; </p>
<p>Correction.  Left out the word &#8220;libertarian&#8221; from fourth sentence from the end in the original.  Apologies.</p>

                                <p>The Bureau of Economic Analysis provides us with the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm">Advanced Estimate</a> for real GDP growth in 2007QI.  While <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/gdp-growth-update.html">Kash</a> cautions that this is only a very early estimate, he calls the 1.3% growth rate and the details “yucky”.  But is there any silver lining?  Let’s look at the details for a moment.  Kash notes that net exports fell, which the “glass is half filled” crowd might interpret by noting the gross domestic purchases rate exceeded the real GDP growth rate.  But this growth rate was only 1.7%, which is still weak.  The fiscal hawk in me is sort of happy that the government purchase growth rate was only 0.9% as defense spending fell.  So the growth rate of the sum of consumption and private investment was even higher than the growth rate of gross domestic purchases.  But wait a second – investment demand fell – both in terms of residential and overall fixed investment demand (OK, nonresidential rose a bit but not as much as it fell in 2006QIV).  So the only silver lining is that consumption demand is still growing at a 3.8% per year – at least for now.  Yep – a further decline in national savings is keeping us of a recession.  Not exactly the best news from a long-term growth perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Cactus in the comments asks how Lawrence Kudlow might declare today’s bad news to be actually good news.  Actually, Kudlow discussed economics last night with <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZGI2ZWUzYzBkZGY1ZjdkYWNmYTFjZDQxMGJlOGRjMTI=">Art Laffer</a> himself.  Kudlow starts off by trying to argue that we’ve never seem higher tax revenues adding this:</p>
<blockquote><p>This reflects, almost always, capital gains tax receipts from the bullish market at the record low 15 percent marginal tax rate on investment. Did someone say Laffer curve?</p></blockquote>
<p>Laffer is joined by Forbes&#8217; Liz MacDonald as they continue to babble on as if investment demand was really strong.  Yes – I wonder how this crew will spin today’s news that investment demand has declined!</p>

                                <p>I really haven&#8217;t thought this post through very well&#8230; its more a collection of unfinished thoughts with a unifying theme&#8230;.</p>
<p>I was thinking about a few things. I imagine, based on comments and e-mails I receive that most of our readers are slightly left of center. Sure, we have a few right wingers and a few libertarians, and perhaps ten percent of our readers could be described as socialist. I&#8217;m not sure we have any regular readers that are to the left of socialist though. </p>
<p>I was trying to think of what is the difference between being roughly where most of our readers are and being on the right. Most of us believe in the same things&#8230; we believe that there should be markets, for instance. However, we disagree about the degree of government regulation of those markets. A strict libertarian might feel that there should be zero regulation, but I imagine there aren&#8217;t that many of those. As a general rule, therefore, I would imagine those on the left will generally want more government regulation of markets than those on the right. The idea, for those on the left, is to reduce externalities, deal with asymmetric information, etc. For those on the right, the market itself will deal with that.</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems to me that in this internet age, its easy to create any kind of market (or even internet community) one wants, provided its legal. Since there is already a government out there in the background imposing the entire body of law on everyone, one would imagine that if the right is, well, right, on-line market sites wouldn&#8217;t need any additional rules or regulations. (Similarly, on-line communities or message boards or whatnot would not need any monitors or moderators.) </p>
<p>What do we see? Well, I can think of two very large on-line markets: Craigslist and EBay. Of the two, Craigslist has the lefty reputation. (The Ex-GF uses it as her home page.) And they are pretty left leaning &#8211; right at the top, they have &#8220;community&#8221; links, including links for &#8220;activists&#8221;, etc. And its fairly obvious that the &#8220;personals&#8221; at Craigslist are the kind of thing decried, at least publicly, by any social conservative. And as I understand it, the founder of the company, and the company itself, has a fairly leftward tilt. Is it a real marketplace &#8211; well, its a classified ad system, and functions similarly enough to a market.</p>
<p>EBay is more corporate. And more uptight. With a whole lot more rules and regulations. It seems ironic to me that the lefty site seems to be the one that is more, well, free-wheeling and which imposes less of an encumbrance on its users. But OK&#8230; that&#8217;s just two companies. It isn&#8217;t necessarily generalizable to the left and the right&#8230;</p>
<p>Which raises the question&#8230; where are the places on the net for the true believers? The ones which recognize that the government already has sooooooo many laws and rules that adding any more is superfluous. Where are those marketplaces (of goods and ideas) online where we can see the ideal of the right and the libertarians of no rules and regulations (over and above what the government already imposes)?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I have been ranting about military waste.  I will leave the Air Force alone for now.</p>
<p>Marine Corps and supporting contractors want a new Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV).  It is a whiz bang improvement over the existing ship to shore armored vehicle.  It is a “keystone for both the Marine Corps Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW) and Ship-to-Objective Maneuver (STOM) war fighting concepts” from the EFV site.</p>
<p>What EMW and STOM have to do with the common defense is hard to tell, but it is good for the contractors and careers.  It is no good to anyone if it doesn’t work, which seems to be the case.  It is supposed do 25 kts in sea state 3 and come in from over the horizon.  It can do 45 mph on land and scoot and shoot a 30 mm gun.</p>
<p>It comes out of the wet hull of an amphibious ship.  It is indispensable to that ship’s indispensable capability to go ashore at Iwo Jima again.</p>
<p>So far, Washington Post reports, the Corps has spent 10 years and $1.2 B and they have problems.  It breaks all the time.  Who was spending $120 million bucks a year and delivering such a mess? </p>
<p>How could it happen?  CoRev thinks I have been on failed programs this is deeper than any of mine.</p>
<p>Here is a process view:</p>
<p>The Marines&#8217; wish is for a vehicle that can both hit the beaches at 25 knots through seas from over the horizon, to sneak up on them, whoever we want that to be.  Then link up with the Army or Marine M-1 tanks and keep up with their Bradleys and Abrahms’.</p>
<p>They hired a contractor to do “system engineering”, over 10 years and $1.2 billion ago, to translate these wishes and a few more like not getting the kids inside killed by .30 caliber ammunition and blasts.  The contractor derives specifications, the government reviews them.</p>
<p>As the contractor designs the thing to the specs they stumble, and bumble along have all kinds of travel and meetings and reviews.  No one really knows what they are looking at and every time they get together the contractor tells them &#8220;everything is great&#8221;, it is not good to be accused of ranting in the contractors plant that things ain’t so hot.  So for 10 years everything is great.</p>
<p>The design has performance specifications for various parts of the system.  The performance specs tell how each part is to work to make the thing go, float, communicate and so forth.  The specifications also include rocket science like: the part has to work for so many hours, a thing called reliability, it has a thing called maintainability and specs for support and technical repair.</p>
<p>It also tells how to link the parts together. </p>
<p>It is a hard job.  It is not done well and no one dare tells how bad it is because it is impolite to rant about the trash that the brass tells congress is a “keystone” of some capability.</p>
<p>These performance specs start at the top level, the vehicle, and break down all the way to the nuts and bolts.  The rocket science got too much for the government and contractor guys.  But everyone went along spending time, traveling about the country and spending the money even though no one had a clue other than making a living and growing their careers. </p>
<p>After they write the specs they do some building and then some testing.  This is done from the nuts and bolts up.  Each item in a spec is supposed to be tested.  Reliability testing is hard because the lower level stuff has to work for a long, long  time between failures so the total vehicle works for a hours.  Reliability is hard, too hard for this group. </p>
<p>Testing long hour reliability requirements takes more time, so it is not done and the guys assume everything is just fine in this “keystone” system.</p>
<p>When the test fails it is again impolite to say the “keystone” is not very good.  To say so is bad for the career.</p>
<p>When you allow faulty design in the nuts and bolts it is like not installing the bearing seals in an engine and putting the thing together.</p>
<p> This wasteful engineering approach with negligent testing is evident in the EFV and is common on many systems.</p>
<p>Tests are very important during design.  There is often not enough money or time even in a $1.2B, 10 years effort.  But a test not performed is not a failed test.  To state otherwise would be to rant.  Get you fired CoRev!</p>
<p>All they will do when they get caught is do it over again. </p>
<p>Jack Welch would say they are producing defects, which is a source of waste.</p>
<p>It is illogical to think and act as if &#8220;the thing is so important that we need to produce and operate it regardless of how expensive, late and bad the performance&#8221;.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve had a few posts lately about Iraq. I noted my opinion is that as long as GW is President, there simply is not enough competence involved in running the war in Iraq for anything good to come of it. I&#8217;m told that a) that&#8217;s Bush Derangement Syndrome (BDS) and b) its not helpful.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s change the story a bit. Say a guy called Jones was hired as Chief of Police of some city. Say also that the downtown area, like any other neighborhood in that particular city, had some crime.  Some of this crime could be traced back to one particular miscreant. Say that Jones promised to clean up the crime, and to do at relatively low cost.</p>
<p>Now, its four years later. Crime has exploded. Car bombs are going off. People get kidnapped off the street, and their bodies are found &#8211; with drill-holes in their knee-caps and elbows several days later. The city&#8217;s infrastructure has fallen apart &#8211; there&#8217;s only electricity for a few hours a day. The locals have split up into gangs that hold full on shootouts, not only with each other but with Jones&#8217; police force. And all along, Jones and his people have insisted things are getting better and better.  And the cost of maintaining the police force has exploded.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I can go on, but you get the picture. Now a question. Is it Jones Derangement Syndrome (JDS) to suggest that perhaps having Jones and his people in charge is part of the problem, and that as long as Jones is in charge, there will be no solution?  And what would you think of the folks that insist on giving Jones a blank check yet again?</p>

Iraq is the prime example.  From <a href="http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/news/nation/17134253.htm">McClatchy Newspapers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Car bombs and other explosive devices have killed thousands of Iraqis in the past three years, but the administration doesn&#8217;t include them in the casualty counts it has been citing as evidence that the surge of additional U.S. forces is beginning to defuse tensions between Shiite and Sunni Muslims. </p>
<p>President Bush explained why in a television interview on Tuesday. &#8220;If the standard of success is no car bombings or suicide bombings, we have just handed those who commit suicide bombings a huge victory,&#8221; he told TV interviewer Charlie Rose. </p></blockquote>
<p>By that standard, we could show that the murder rate in the US just dropped to zero.  After all, counting people who were actually killed would just hand a huge victory to those who kill.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A court in Argentina just <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6594127.stm">cancelled the pardons</a> that had been granted for human rights violations to former leaders of the Argentine military junta.  Those pardons, granted under the Menem administration back in 1990, have been ruled unconstitutional.</p>
<p>My personal opinion &#8211; without the pardons at the time, there was a bit of danger that the military would try to take over again.  At the very least, I think it is reasonably likely that the military would have tried to remain semi-independent, never coming under complete control of the civilian government.  Put another way&#8230; the civilian government at the time was somewhat blackmailed into giving these pardons.  And pardons given as a result of blackmail&#8230; well, I don&#8217;t see how they would be legal under most systems of government.</p>
<p>But it got me thinking&#8230; why aren&#8217;t there all that many military coups in South America any more.  When I was growing up in South America, military regimes abounded. After all, they still have the guns.  Overthrowing a civilian government can&#8217;t be that difficult.  (Note &#8211; this question is generalizable.  Why haven&#8217;t there been military coups in the US?  And why do we still see them in some parts of Asia and the Middle East?)  All I can come up with is this:</p>
<p>Military regimes failed even in the minds of military, at least in South America.  So why would an officer want the problems associated being President?  And if one did decide to be President, how would he know whether enough others would follow along?  </p>
<p>Another random thought:</p>
<p>The US ceased to support military types in Latin America after the 1980s.  Was Clinton less likely to provide support for new and existing dictators than Reagan and GHW?  In Latin America, that does seem to be the case.  I can&#8217;t see Clinton calling a butcher like Rios Montt a man of great personal integrity as Reagan did, be he a preacher or not.  And it does seem we&#8217;ve become friendlier toward some tyrants (think Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt) since GW took office.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I kinda ran out of thoughts this morning.  Let me know yours.</p>
