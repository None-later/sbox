                                <p>I&#8217;ve always thought the primary system only really makes sense in an era when the primary modes of transportation are walking and riding horses and when acces to newspapers and magazines (not to mention the internet) is very limited.</p>
<p>The post below is by reader T-Bone.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>The current US voting system seems rather inefficient in selecting candidate the &#8220;majority&#8221; really wants. The primaries usually end up selecting a more extreme candidate (very liberal for democrats, very conservative for republicans), and making those 2 candidates the only 2 worth voting for, since no other candidate has a chance. Currently, 3rd party candidates or a candidate who loses the primary but continues to run can split votes. Even though the majority of voters might have wanted either of those 2 candidates to win, they only get to choose one of them. This could allow an opposition opponent to win with a minority of the vote.</p>
<p>For example, Ralph Nader is commonly blamed for acquiring votes that would probably otherwise go to the democrat Al Gore, helping him to win a close presidential race. If your preferred candidate isn&#8217;t going to win, do you vote for him/her just on principle, or do you select between only the 2 major contenders. What I suggest is a system where you don&#8217;t need make that choice, a system where you can place an order-of-preference vote. </p>
<p>I think it would be a relatively simple and effective solution to have a system where each candidate&#8217;s votes are compared to another candidate&#8217;s votes individually. If in the 2000 election you select Nader as your #1 choice, and Al Gore as your 2nd choice, the system would take that into account. It might first do an analysis of Nader. It might compare Nader to Bush, seeing how many people Bush ranked higher than Nader. If you your order of preference goes Gore-Nader-Bush, or Nader-Bush-Gore, or Nader-Gore-Bush, then that adds to the vote count for Nader in this comparison. Likewise, having Bush&#8217;s name coming before Nader&#8217;s name in your preferences, It counts as a vote for Bush in this comparison. The system does the same for Nader vs Gore, and Gore vs Bush, etc. The winner will be the candidate that beats all other candidates in head-to-head comparisons, finding themselves ranked higher than the opposing candidate in order of preference. </p>
<p>Imagine 3 candidates, L (Liberal), M (Moderate), and C (Conservative). Now allow voters to rank the candidates in order of preference. Starting with 2 voters (1 liberal, 1 conservative), their order of preference might look like the following: </p>
<p>Voter 1: L > M > C (voter prefers Liberal, then moderate, and lastly conservative)<br />Voter 2: C > M > L</p>
<p>You might have thought this would have resulted in the moderate candidate winning, but it&#8217;s actual a 3-way tie. Evaluating candidate L, he has the vote of voter #1, but voter # 2 makes him tied versus both candidates M and C (since voter #2 prefers either of those 2 over candidate L). And vice-versa for candidate C. </p>
<p>Now if you add in a 3rd voter, a moderate, with voting preferences like this:<br />M > L > C</p>
<p>You get results:<br />L vs C = 2 votes to 1<br />M vs L = 2 to 1<br />M vs C = 2 to 1</p>
<p>Candidate M has beaten both opponents and wins this election. <br />How about this one:</p>
<p>L > M > C<br />C > M > L<br />C > M > L<br />M > L > C</p>
<p>L > M > C<br />C > M > L<br />C > M > L<br />M > L > C</p>
<p>Results are:<br />C vs L = 2-2<br />C vs M = 2-2<br />M vs L = 3-1</p>
<p>This one is a tie between C and M. But L has lost because more voters favor M over L. You need to beat everyone to win. But it&#8217;s very unlikely that there would be an unclear result, just as in our current system (but of course, with only 4 voters in the example, ties and such are much more likely). </p>
<p>Also, there is no need for every voter to rank every candidate. People can still vote for just one candidate, or just rank 2 of them etc. Their vote will still be just as effective. But they will just not influence comparisons between 2 candidates they did not rank. </p>
<p>This could make primaries obsolete. Politicians will need to appeal to all people. Even if the majority of Americans wanted to vote democratic, the democratic candidates would have to appeal to as many people as possible, even conservatives, so that they are more often ranked higher than their competitors. Even if the democrats are assured of victory over conservatives, then which democrat gets elected depends on which one appeals most to the republicans. </p>
<p>Likewise, in the 2004 election, a popular slogan was &#8220;Anybody but Bush&#8221;. If Republicans still won, but Bush had to face a Republican, Bush would probably need all of the conservatives to rank him higher than his fellow Republican competitor, because I&#8217;m sure most liberals would rate that Republican competitor higher than Bush. But even better, imagine that you can have a 2nd Republican being a viable choice and not simple resigned to defeat after losing the party ticket&#8230; now you&#8217;d have a Republican pointing out the faults of Bush, forcing Bush to try to appeal to the center (but more likely failing and being replaced with a more moderate candidate). Of course, it works on both sides of the aisle&#8230; Democrats will have the same challenge to face.</p>

<p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002986.html">Max Sawicky</a> has more fun with <a href="http://www.examiner.com/a-663267~White_House_says_economic_surge_robust.html">this</a>, which goes in a different direction that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/mankiw-all-that-talk-about-tax-cuts-and.html">we did</a>.  Max has been reading a few rightwing blogs who think the 4.4% unemployment rate in March 2007 was lower than any of the unemployment rates we saw under Clinton.  He also notes that Tony Fratto made this claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you go back to this point in the Clinton expansion,&#8221; Fratto said, &#8220;they would have loved to have seen the numbers that we have right now.&#8221;  &#8220;On the unemployment rate, we&#8217;re a full percentage point below where they were at the same point in the expansion &#8211; 60 or 61 months in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They would have loved to have been at 4.4 percent. They were still up in the mid-5s, which is huge, when you think about it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now it is true that the unemployment rate as of March 1998 was 4.7%.  But take a look at our graph and see what Max means by:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Clinton took office it was 7.3. Once reason Bush does better by this particular metric is because he followed Clinton.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the decline in the unemployment rate was greater during the first five years of the Clinton Presidency than the decline during the first five years of the Bush43 Administration.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Leave to a National Review nitwit such as <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTBkZmU1NDg3MDUyYzJiNDc2NGFkMjJlYTQzMjY1YzA=">Jonah Goldberg</a> to suggest <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives2/004013.php">this stupidity</a> from Glenn Reynolds was a “good little post”.  Jonah – try checking with Max before posting things that will come back to embarrass you.</p>
<p>One of Glenn’s readers blames the weakness of the recovery on the press:</p>
<blockquote><p>That said, the current economy is strong despite a cataclysmic terrorist attack, a devastating hurricane, high gas prices and incessant, negative reporting. As I&#8217;m sure you can imagine, chronic negative reporting does affect the public&#8217;s opinion even when the facts belie the media&#8217;s and politicians&#8217; misrepresentations.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if Meg Kreikemeier has empirical support for this thesis and if she’ll be submitting this to the American Economic Review for publication?</p>

                                <p>For the past couple years, I have been frustrated trying to make sense of the media’s reporting, and the Administration’s touting, of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ jobs numbers. In addition to conflicting evidence, journalistic laziness, and administrative propaganda, there has been the disjointedness of the reporting: It is one or two data points at a time. That does not help make sense of the numbers. Context is needed; we have to unify to understand.
</p>
<p>The result, initially for me as an analyst, and now to share with you, is a simple index that helps make sense of the jobs data. It is based on the strong correlation between the payroll data and the working age population, ages 18-64. Here is a chart of the two data series, with the population data overlaid on the payroll data.
<p></p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/RhpUme5zX8I/AAAAAAAAAAs/oEH8U4TxVu4/s1600-h/Overlay18_64Jan48_Mar07.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/RhpUme5zX8I/AAAAAAAAAAs/oEH8U4TxVu4/s320/Overlay18_64Jan48_Mar07.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is reasonable to select the age range <ins cite="mailto:Frank%20de%20Libero" datetime="2007-04-05T17:36">of 18</ins> through <ins cite="mailto:Frank%20de%20Libero" datetime="2007-04-05T17:36">64</ins>-year olds,<ins cite="mailto:Frank%20de%20Libero" datetime="2007-04-05T17:36"> </ins>and that the two data series are related. Empirically it is compelling. There are a couple asides worth mentioning. The data selected is all of<ins cite="mailto:Frank%20de%20Libero" datetime="2007-04-05T17:36"> </ins>the monthly data available from the BLS <ins cite="mailto:Frank%20de%20Libero" datetime="2007-04-05T17:36">(</ins>yearly payroll data going back to about 1919 is also available). And the other is there is no generally agreed to definition of “working age.” The BLS’ default definition, e.g., is ages 16-plus. I have used 18 through 64 because it intuitively makes sense and gives a better fit to the payroll data.<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/RhpUme5zX8I/AAAAAAAAAAs/oEH8U4TxVu4/s1600-h/Overlay18_64Jan48_Mar07.jpg"></a>
<p>Once this relationship is observed, then a job creation index follows. I use the net monthly change in jobs divided by the total monthly working-age population in 1,000’s, and call it JPT (jobs per thousand). This index gives us a tool to easily make comparisons and appeal to standards. Here is a chart of the index from January 1997 to the current jobs estimate of March 2007.</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/RhpV5u5zX9I/AAAAAAAAAA0/3YaLcbJcHyE/s1600-h/JPT_97m1_07m3A.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/RhpV5u5zX9I/AAAAAAAAAA0/3YaLcbJcHyE/s320/JPT_97m1_07m3A.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p></p>
</p>
<p>An example of the advantage of appealing to a standard – here, the average – is that the expected number of jobs is 186,000. We get to this result by noting from the data that the total population of 18 through 64-year olds is currently 186 million. Since JPT by definition is one in a thousand and its mean or expected value is 1, we get an expected number of 186,000 net jobs for March. So how would you rate 180,000 jobs? A synonym for average is mediocre. Empirically, the initial net payroll number of 180,000 is mediocre.
</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the bigger picture gets us closer to unity and understanding.</p>
<p>My next post will use the population and payroll data to show (initial estimates) there is a shortfall between 5M and 12M jobs with an approximate $30B loss just in tax revenue.</p>

                                <p>In the real world I am regarded as knowing something about healthcare. I shy away from the word &#8220;expert&#8221; but I guess I have to accept that title.</p>
<p>I recently received my monthly AARP magazine, and there was a boxed comment that said:</p>
<p><strong>“People are willing to make sacrifices to ensure that everyone has access to health insurance.”</p>
<p></strong>Really?</p>
<p>Having had hundreds of face-to-face encounters with patients and families (<em><strong>my </strong></em>ex-girlfriend, the saint, has had thousands) I doubt this.</p>
<p>Many of us don’t mind paying taxes for other people’s healthcare, but I don’t think many Americans would wait a month for an MRI after blowing out a knee.</p>
<p>This does not make Americans evil or selfish IMHO, there are standards of access most of us enjoy (and most health providers strive for) and I don’t think many want to give up that access.</p>
<p>Any single payer system would ultimately restrict access, whether that lowers outcomes is hard to say (I don’t think any country has a good benchmarking system for measuring quality of outcomes).</p>
<p>So, is the AARP correct? Would you sacrifice your family or personal access, or pay more, for someone else&#8217;s healthcare? Would most Americans?</p>

<blockquote><p>The White House says the economic surge that began five and a half years ago on President Bush&#8217;s watch is more robust than the much-touted expansion during the Clinton administration.  &#8220;This is a much stronger expansion in a lot of ways,&#8221; White House spokesman Tony Fratto told The Examiner. &#8220;It&#8217;s much deeper and more measured.&#8221; Fratto&#8217;s assertion was disputed by Gene Sperling &#8230; That&#8217;s a rather absurd claim,&#8221; said Sperling, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress. &#8220;In terms of job creation, in terms of wage growth, in terms of business investment, in terms of poverty, there&#8217;s absolutely no comparison.&#8221; &#8220;The expansion during the 90s was exceptionally strong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And this has been a historically weak expansion in virtually all of those measures.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/04/goofy-debate.html">Greg Mankiw</a> doesn’t challenge Gene Sperling on the facts so he decides to reply with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The discussion seems to presume that presidents have tight control over the economy. Of course, they don&#8217;t. The tools of fiscal policy are blunt, and there are many other forces at work that determine economic prosperity. Regardless of which expansion is better, it tells you little about the relative merits of the two presidents&#8217; economic policies.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree – but doesn’t this suggest that all this talk about the tax cuts being the cause of the recovery is just goofy?  As you read the rest of Sammon’s article, you’ll see even more goofiness including the line that Lawrence Kudlow is an economist.</p>

<p>Every journalist, I suppose, has a list of questions they dream of asking some famous person, preferably on live network TV.</p>
<p>My personal daydream at the moment is to stand up and ask President Bush whether he can name the seven deadly sins.</p>
<p>I suppose he would wiggle out of it, look blank, or get a witty comeback courtesy of his walky- talky backpack.  But in a daydream like this, it is more the response of the listeners than that of the patsy which matters.  In this scenario, the listeners would blink and realize that not only does the emperor have no clothes, but he has no clues.  Then a national discussion would arise, driving Justin and Britney off the airwaves.  Well, I did say it was a daydream.</p>
<p>This brings us to the one of the seven deadly sins which is called &#8220;acedia&#8221;.  Acedia is a Latin word, from Greek akedia, literally meaning &#8220;absence of caring&#8221;.</p>
<p>A great deal of the triumph of corporatism in recent decades has to do with the entrenchment of acedia in western thought, and its wilful spread by authorities who may or may not believe in it.  Why deadly?&#8221;  Because as a result of buying into acedia, ordinary people lose the ability to defend themselves from the pressures of the supply side market.</p>
<p>It shows up in public language, in legal rulings, and in the concerns to which public institutions and pervasive spokespersons grant or do not grant validity.  Sun Tzu famously said the best way to win a war is to remove the enemy&#8217;s will to resist.  Acedia is what you have left when that will to resist is removed.</p>
<p>I used to argue with a pleasant, large and kindly co-worker who was a business writer and who had thoroughly bought into  the business model.  He had heard all my arguments from others, and heard them again from me with, I must say, remarkable patience.</p>
<p>A catalogue of the disasters of pollution, social collapse, slave labour, and the dozens of other worries of typical &#8220;left-leaning&#8221; citizens, did nothing to ruffle his condescending smile.  He really, truly didn&#8217;t care.  He told me often, in response to my diatribes, that he expected to die, and that would be it, and any problems in the living world were his children&#8217;s problems.  The Chinese economic model?  &#8220;Why should you care what happens to some Chinese guy?&#8221; he asked me curiously.  Their policies were making the Chinese GDP rise rapidly, and damn the pandas.  Everything will die, so what does it matter?</p>
<p>But he didn&#8217;t not care about everything, only some things.  When it came to tax rates, government controls on business, and the interference of human rights and environmental issues with the development of industry, he could wax quite wroth. </p>
<p>The danger of buying into acedia is that when one&#8217;s own desires and priorities are disparaged, they become quaint and expendable factors, as unimportant as choosing green over brown when buying a shirt — even in areas of compelling human significance.</p>
<p>All economy, all of it, is based on human choice and the allocation of human energy and attention.  There are physical limits to the energy and capacity for attention of any individual, so beyond a certain point, extraordinary pressures must be put in place to persuade people to allocate more and more attention and energy toward the desires of industries, which after all exist and survive only because of the participation of human beings..</p>
<p>This is the essence of supply-side economics, and induced acedia makes the process a great deal easier.</p>
<p>Well, I can hear some of our readers asking, &#8220;So what if people&#8217;s choices are subverted and bent to the service of the economy?  Isn&#8217;t a lively economy good for us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe.  Sometimes.  But busier is not necessarily better.  As a child learning to swim, I had to be taught that the most efficient swimming caused the least froth.  A frothy economy is only good for the very few who can ride the foam.</p>
<p>The GDP is not a measure of genuine wellbeing, but only of froth.  Take one hypothetical example:  if we cut our sugar industry by 95%, and as a result cut our insulin industry by 98% and the health care industry by 20%, there would be a huge net loss to the GDP and an enormous benefit to our shared prosperity.</p>
<p>When someone sets aside what you really value, and tells you to substitute other values, sometimes they are reliable teachers whose advice will benefit you.  Other times, they serve their own desires instead of yours.  Alertness to this distinction can serve us well.</p>
<p>***<br />The seven are: Luxuria (extravagance, later lust), Gula (gluttony), Avaritia (greed), Acedia (sloth), Ira (wrath), Invidia (envy), and Superbia (pride).</p>

                                <p>If the messenger is credible and you get the deeper picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good News Can Be Good&#8221; By William F. Buckley Jr. Apr 7 2007 at National Review Online</p>
<p>After quoting Gen. David Petraeus on The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer on April 3 Buckley states:</p>
<p>“It is of course preposterous to assume that we have here a critical strategic turning point in the fortunes of the Iraqi enterprise. But one reflects on the Vietnam parallel. Toward the end of 1973 and into 1974, the South Vietnamese army was holding well against the communists. There were grounds for genuine strategic optimism, but supplies were needed, and could only be had from Washington.”</p>
<p>Strategic optimism, wishful thinking!!  What is strategic optimism?  I do not recall the ARVN doing so well in 73, the NVA was building up their resources.</p>
<p>This is the old line, if we had supplied the ARVN they could have held out against the nationalists. This is wrong and plays only to the feint hope that you can outlast the residents.</p>
<p>This wishful thinking implies we can win at the guerillas’ game and merely stay in the game and win.</p>
<p>The ARVN might have, should have, maybe got lucky and survived another year.</p>
<p>To imply that we could have sent more supplies is no way supportive of we could keep on keeping on with no result.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Buckley says: “The effort to stabilize Iraq is making strides, if Gen. Petraeus is to be trusted.”</p>
<p>It is prepsoterous to think any progress is being made much less a turning point in Iraq Bill forgot he used the word preposterous earlier in the article.</p>
<p>Then all he he asks is to trust this guy, I do not.   I do not believe his optimism is real, I do not know his strategy nor his operational focus, nor that he or anyone still in the fray has any plan other than to attempt to outlast &#8220;them&#8221;.</p>
<p>That is why we left Vietnam, outlasting them is not strategy it is tactic and we lose when we confuse how we fight for why we fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them&#8221; is far more than al Qaeda in Iraq.</p>

                                <p>Last Febuary, I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/stormys-post-on-ipcc-report-and-wto.html">addressed</a> some of the issues surrounding the WTO and the February release of the IPCC report. A few days ago, Working Group Two released the draft of the second part of the IPPC Report: <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM6avr07.pdf">Summary for Policy Makers</a>, dealing with climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest that everyone read this latest report, very sobering indeed. Climate change is here, now, and working its wicked magic all around us. Remember, this is a conservative report, having been passed through a number of bureaucratic hands. To get some idea of the wrangling over this report and how much it has been watered down, read <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/06/news/climate.php">Global politics shift as experts say warming is setting in</a>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Many delegates said they were disappointed to see parts of the report toned down under pressure from countries including Russia, Saudi Arabia and particularly China, which argued that some of the findings in the main study &#8211; based on 29,000 sets of data &#8211; were not solid enough to form part of the summary. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Hallegatte said that one reason the meeting went through the night was that some European delegates had demanded that the final report reflect the needs for cutting back on greenhouse gases-not just adapting to new conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Stephen Schneider, a climatologist at Stanford University, said Russia and China were among the countries that opposed inclusion of the mitigation scenarios supported so strongly by Europe. He said the United States had asked that statements about ice sheets be removed but that the “Americans were much more helpful than they were harmful.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some of the highlights of the report:</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Increased drought in some areas; increased flooding from rainfall and runoff in others.</li>
<li>Decreased water supplies because of glacier and snow pack disappearance, affecting one-sixth of the world&#8217;s population.</li>
<li>Increased acidification of the ocean. See my pH <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/stormy-on-matter-of-ph.html">post</a> as well as my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/stormys-post-on-ipcc-report-and-wto.html">WTO post</a>. Fish stocks are already precariously declining because of over-fishing. Global warming will be the nail in the coffin.</li>
<li>Increased danger to terrestrial life as habitats change. We are talking of the extinction of thousands of species here. One study in <a href="http://www.geog.umd.edu/resac/outgoing/GEOG442%20Fall%202005/Lecture%20materials/extinctions%20and%20climate%20change.pdf">Nature</a>, after sampling 20% of the terrestrial surface, found that between 18% to 35% of species in those areas will be committed to extinction by 2050, within the lifetime of many people who read this blog. We are not talking just a few majestic polar bears and cute harp seals here.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the U.S. in particular, water shortages are growing in the West and Southwest. We may be seeing the beginnings of a new dust bowl. Lake Mead has already dropped more than 80’feet. A New York Times article, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/04/us/04drought.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">An Arid West No longer Waits for Rain</a>, provides an excellent overview of the problems now facing the West and Southwest. Water is becoming a critical issue in American life.</p>
<p>Reading the latest IPCC report, you may not get a vivid sense of the vast changes <i>already occurring.</i> Such reports are purposively neutered and dry. Nonetheless, the changes are real and growing in lethality. Not a great of time is left.</p>
<p>Althought the IPCC meets in plenary session each year, its major reports are five to six years apart, making the next major one possibly due in 2012. By 2012, China, India, and the United States are expected to dump an extra 2.7 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere, with China adding an additional 562 coal burning plants. And by 2012, Kyoto was expected to reduce CO2 emissions 483 millions tons. My math tells me that in those three countries alone global Kyoto shortfall will be about 2.2 billion tons of greenhouse gases. As weak and as noble a goal as it was, Kyoto will never happen. And Kyoto was the result of the second IPCC report.</p>
<p>Two strands are converging: Global Warming and a dangerous economic model embodied by the IMF and economic globalization principles based on greed and consumption. Iraq is a sideshow; terrorism, a diversion. Despite what the Chinese or the Americans or the Russians or the Saudis think about their place in history, this century will not be their show. Nature is coming to bat; she bats only for her team, no one else&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Running parallel to the above strands are two other forces: IT and the incredible explosion of knowledge in almost every area of learning. From academic disciplines to corporations to countries, vast amounts of information are being collected and assimilated. IT feeds the explosion and processing of knowledge…it is driving this incredible renaissance in a self-perpetuating cycle. IT and the growth of knowledge feed globalization. But at the same time, they are providing us with the tools with which to understand how we are changing the planet.</p>
<p>Whether one set of forces will contain and control or propel the other is a very big question for me. Will our knowledge help us or be used to further endanger us? Will it serve purely economic interests or the interests of us all? The next ten or twenty years will tell the story.</p>
<p>Exogenous variables will and must move front and center in all economic models. The &#8220;free&#8221; market place will and must be seen as the last place to entrust the future well being of the peoples of the earth. So, too, will right-wing thinking about birth control and abortion. Either we control population growth, or it will control us. Either we control our pollution or it will control us. The species of a population can crash when its success destroys its own environment. If this possibility is not part of economic theory, it should be.</p>
<p>My complaint with economics, which I consider to be <i>the key player</i> in the future of the planet, is that it has not paid enough attention both in theory and in fact to the effect that the presently espoused principles of the market place are having on the world around us. In not always addressing environmental issues in trade and commerce,we are endangering the lives of everyone. Privatization of resources is an immense danger. We have enshrined greed, consumption, and profit almost as first principles, from which all good will flow.</p>
<p>The market place is myopic, sensitive only to immediate fluctuations in the economic environment. Other considerations are rarely within its ken: the environment and the depletion of resources, and population growth. What if glaciers are melting, endangering one-sixth of the world&#8217;s population? What if fish and terrestrial life forms are in danger? What if the seas rise and storms increase in number? Keep your eye only on your business and profit; companies must grow; money must be made. Look only a few feet ahead. More people means bigger markets. The ominous gathering clouds seem too distant. Besides, how could that approaching storm be our creation? Blame anything else, not ourselves. Blame the sun; blame a &#8220;raptur&#8221;-&#8220;us&#8221; God. But certainly never blame economic first principles.</p>

<p><a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/us-korea-free-trade-agreement.html">Kash</a> opened this discussion with the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>average hourly labor costs in manufacturing in Korea were fully 57% of US labor costs in 2005</p></blockquote>
<p>He has continued to contribute to it in his comment to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/free-trade-agreement-with-south-korea.html">my post</a> where I noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me turn Ricardian for a moment and note that wage differentials are not exactly the same thing as differences in unit labor costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The series on average labor costs from the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ichcc.t01.htm">BLS</a> is an index showing the ratio of Korean hourly compensation costs for production workers in manufacturing relative to compensation for U.S. production worker in manufacturing.  From 1990 to 1995, this index rose from 25% to 42%.  By 2002, it had declined to 41%.  This does not mean Korean wages fell.  Rather this was a period where U.S. workers enjoyed significant increases in real compensation.  From 2002 to 2005, this index rose from 41% to 57% as Korean workers continued to enjoy significant increases in real compensation, while U.S. workers were less fortunate.  </p>
<p>When Kash came through with <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/ForeignLabor/prodsuppt10.txt">this series</a> on unit labor costs for Korea and the U.S. over time, which we have graphed, Spencer had to remind us that these were indices.  In other words, all we can infer from this graph is that both nations have seen their unit labor costs decline by about 13% from 1992 to 2005.  But without some comparison in unit labor costs between the two nations at some point in time during this period, we cannot infer more than that.  </p>
<p>But then Kash let us know about <a href="http://www.phil.frb.org/econ/br/br98.html">this paper</a> by Stephen Golub entitled <em>Does Trade with Low-Wage Countries Hurt American Workers</em>.  Golub also goes Ricardian with:</p>
<blockquote><p>differences in wage rates between countries largely reflect differences in labor productivity (output per hour worked). For example, wages are low in India because productivity is low. Thus, the costs of producing goods are not as different across countries as wage rates suggest. Indeed, the United States as a whole benefits from international trade, irrespective of the wage levels of its trading partners, by specializing in what we do well and importing goods that are most efficiently produced elsewhere &#8230; Wages and labor productivity are related (Figure 2). For example, in 1990 wages in Malaysia were 10 percent of wages in the United States. But Malaysian labor productivity was also about 10 percent of the U.S. level in 1990. This means that unit labor costs (the ratio of wages to productivity) were approximately the same in Malaysia and the United States because the difference in productivity almost exactly offset the difference in wages between the two countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what about Korea?  Figure 1 of Golub’s paper shows hourly compensation in the U.S. versus Korea documenting the fact that the differential has between U.S. wages and Korean wages has been closing since 1975 as Korean wages have risen faster than U.S. wages.  Figure 2 compares productivity and wages in Korea as compared to the U.S as of 1995. Golub writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wages and labor productivity also move together over time for individual countries. For example, Korea experienced both high wage growth and high productivity growth in manufacturing over 1970-95, compared with the United States (Figure 3). In 1970, Korean wages were 8 percent of U.S. wages, while Korean productivity was 14 percent of U.S. productivity. By 1995, Korean productivity had reached 69 percent of the U.S. level, while Korean wages grew to 48 percent of American wages. Note that U.S. manufacturing productivity and wages grew steadily over this period, so Figure 3 indicates very strong growth in Korean wages and productivity. Korean workers have greatly benefited from Korea’s phenomenal economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, unit labor costs in Korea were only 57% of unit labor costs for the U.S. in 1970 but had risen to 70% of unit labor costs for the U.S. by 1995.  Golub notes that Korea’s wages had risen in line with its productivity increases over the 1970 to 1995 period.  Korea’s productivity continued to grow faster than that of the U.S. from 1995 to 2005 but the differential in unit labor costs did not change as Korean workers benefited from faster wage growth.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Since several readers have noted that swings in the exchange rate can impact relative unit labor costs, we show the sharp devaluation of the won and subsequent appreciation &#8211; which likely is one reason the Korean unit labor cost series displays its swings over this period.</p>

<p>There is one more thing about this debate between <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/04/what_did_you_kn.html">Mark Thoma</a> and <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/04/bruce_bartlett_.html#c65559962">Bruce Bartlett</a>.  After Paul Krugman corrected Bruce’s impression of what we were being taught in the 1970’s, Bruce fired off this rather pathetic remark:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Paul Krugman is right, then where did all the policy mistakes of the 1970s come from?</p></blockquote>
<p>Bruce of all people should know that policymakers do not always follow the advice given by economists.  Or is Bruce suggesting that Bush’s fiscal fiasco due to the supply-side spin emanating from the likes of Lawrence Kudlow.  Oh wait – Kudlow isn’t an economist so I need to do a little better, like presenting a couple of time series.  </p>
<p>The first relates to business cycles.   Our first graph shows real GDP versus the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publications/bysubject.cfm?cat=0">CBO estimate</a> of potential GDP.  With growing real GDP, we need a second graph showing the GDP gap to even see the business cycles of the 1970’s.  But that 1982 recession certainly shows up quite clearly.  So why did we have such a deep recession during Reagan’s second term?  My view has to do with those <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/i-trust-bruce-bartlett-understands.html">tax cuts and tight money</a> that Bruce thinks were wonderful. But the reality was that the Volcker FED had been easing up after its initial tight money burst to lower inflation.  But when the FED saw the fiscal train wreck of Reagan’s fiscal policy, it stepped on the monetary brakes with a vengeance.  With floating exchange rates, this macro-mix that raised real interest rates not only led to investment crowding-out but also net export crowding-out.  So with this pressure of fiscal irresponsibility, one might see why the FED did want it did – even though it likely overreacted.  Yes, maybe we economists should have reminded policymakers that fiscal policy multipliers are smaller and monetary policy multipliers are greater under floating exchange rates.  But no one can doubt that the early 1980’s had massive policy mistakes.   </p>
<p>But listening to the Laffer school of free lunch supply-siders cost us more than business cycle problems.  Our last graph shows the difference between real GDP and the sum of consumption and government purchases aka gross savings – as well as investment and net exports (which of course must add up to savings).  The legacy of the 1981 tax cut was a reduction in the national savings rate.  The legacy of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts was another reduction in the national savings rate.  And the reduced wealth accumulation has had a negative impact on the growth rate of potential GDP.  During the 1981 to 1992, potential GDP grew by less than 3% per year.  During the past six years, potential GDP has been even lower.  </p>
<p>Supply-siders love to tell us that tax cuts encourage more savings and investment leading to faster output growth.  The only problem is that the evidence from their celebrated experiments shows there was less savings and less long-term growth.</p>
