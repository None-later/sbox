<blockquote><p>I was a bit surprised (and disappointed) that Tim Russert and Sen. Leahy let Sen. Hatch&#8217;s false &#8220;there isn&#8217;t a shred of evidence&#8221; of impropriety canard on MTP go unchallenged, when discussing purge-gate. A Republican former U.S. attorney testified to Congress (under oath, if I recall correctly) that two Republican congressmen called him in an attempt to influence his prosecutorial discretion to benefit one of those congressmen. That&#8217;s definitely at least a &#8220;shred&#8221; and more.</p></blockquote>
<p>Josh replies:</p>
<blockquote><p>I didn&#8217;t see this myself. But Sen. Hatch (R-UT) has shown pretty clearly that he doesn&#8217;t have enough respect for the proper administration of the Justice Department to even be on the Judiciary committee. None of his Republican colleagues on the committee have been so exclusively focused on carrying the White House&#8217;s water on this one at the expense of the rule of law.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well I did watch the overheated, blowhard, and dishonest performance from Whoring Hatch in his appearance on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17857501">Meet The Press</a>.  Two comments: (1) Josh is correct – Whoring Hatch has zero respect “for the proper administration of the Justice Department to even be on the Judiciary committee”.  Heck – he has no respect for the truth; and (2) the fellow that emailed him is correct – Tim Russert was his usual worthless self as a Republican lied to his face because the Republican knew Russert would not ask the tough follow-up questions.  Hatch lied to Russert over and over and got away with it.  Wonder what told Whoring Hatch that he would get away with such pathetic behavior?  </p>
<p>Memo to NBC: fire Russert.  Fire him now!</p>

                                <p><a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/tax-cut-parable.html">Kash</a> suggests that <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/03/barstool-tax-policy.html">Greg Mankiw</a> was not careful in his beer drinking example:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first and second men (the poorest) used to pay $0.20. Now they pay only $0.15 (a savings of $0.05, or 23%). They must then pay an additional $0.16 somewhere down the road.</p>
<p>The third and fourth men (the next poorest) used to pay $1.25. Now they pay only $0.90 each (an immediate savings of $0.35, or 28%), but must pay an additional $0.46 each later.</p>
<p>The fifth and sixth men used to pay $4.05 each. Now they pay only $3.25 each (an immediate savings of $0.80, or 20%), but must pay an additional $1.00 each later.</p>
<p>The seventh and eighth men used to pay $8.70 each. Now they pay only $7.10 each (an immediate savings of $1.60, or 18%), but must pay an additional $1.90 each later.</p>
<p>The ninth man (the second-richest) used to pay $15.60. Now he pays only $12.45 (an immediate savings of $3.15, or 20%), but must pay an additional $3.10 later.</p>
<p>Finally, the tenth man (the richest, who had an income about ten times that of the fifth man, and five times that of the seventh man) used to pay $56.00. Now he pays only $45.00 (an immediate savings of $11.00, or 20%), but must pay an additional $9.75 later.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds about right for the tax deferral strategy that Bush used to make us all think we were better off.  So let’s recap.  The poorest see their tab rise by 80%.  The third and fourth fellows see their tab go up by about 9%.  The fifth and sixth men see their tab go up by about 5%.  The seventh and eighth men see their taxes go up by about 3.5%.  Number nine about breaks even with the richest fellow in the bar seeing his tab fall by more than 3%.  </p>
<p>No wonder Kash’s bartender did not increase the price of munchies.  Must better to send the deferred tabs in the mail so the patrons would not know until days later!</p>
<p>Greg?  You were saying?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1107AP_Iraq_McCain.html">Kim Gamel</a> reports on a couple of Senators visiting the Middle East:</p>
<blockquote><p>McCain, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, was combative during a press conference in the military&#8217;s media center in the heavily guarded Green Zone, and responded testily to a question about remarks he had made in the United States last week that it was safe to walk some Baghdad streets.  &#8220;The American people are not getting the full picture of what&#8217;s happening here. They&#8217;re not getting the full picture of the drop in murders, the establishment of security outposts throughout the city, the situation in Anbar province, the deployment of additional Iraqi brigades which are performing well, and other signs of progress having been made,&#8221; said McCain, of Arizona.  He said the Republican congressional delegation he led to Iraq drove from Baghdad&#8217;s airport to the center of the city, citing that as proof that security was improving in the capital. Prominent visitors normally make the trip by helicopter.  The delegation was accompanied by heavily armed U.S. troops when they were not in the Green Zone, site of the U.S. Embassy and Iraqi government. They traveled in armored military vehicles under heavy guard.  Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, criticized congressional Democrats who passed spending legislation that would set deadlines for pulling U.S. forces out of Iraq. He said President Bush would veto the measures and should &#8230; The delegation, which also included Rep. Mike Pence, a Republican from Indiana, and Rep. Rick Renzi, an Arizona Republican, spoke glowingly of an hour they spent in the Bab al-Sharqi market which was hit by a suicide bomber on Jan. 22. At least 88 people died in the attack.</p></blockquote>
<p>This doesn’t sound like a safe place to me.  But here we have an all GOP delegation visiting the Middle East with no criticism from the White House, while Pelosi’s bipartisan delegation is getting her labeled supporting our enemies.  As we noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/syrian-trips-white-house-slams.html">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I guess Republicans visiting the Middle East is supporting the troops, while Democrats doing the same are supporting the enemy. How incredibly stupid!</p></blockquote>
<p>On that trip to Bab al-Sharqi market, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/04/01/graham-mccain-rugs">Amanda</a> notes that Lindsey Graham bragged:</p>
<blockquote><p>We went to the market and were just really warmly welcomed. I bought five rugs for five bucks.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess cheap rugs are a sign of a thriving market to Senator Graham but a dollar a rug is <em>really</em> cheap.  I’m assuming that the Senator wouldn’t put something you’d find in the neighbor’s trash into his home so it sounds more like a “fire sale” to me – with fire sale here defined as the sale of goods at extremely low prices, typically when the seller faces bankruptcy or other impending distress.  In a thriving market, an increase in the number of potential buyers would have likely resulted in a much higher price for those rugs.</p>

                                <p>This one is by OldVet.  It complements, but doesn’t entirely agree with a recent PGL post.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Today I read the latest newsletter of John Mauldin, an investment advisor who puts out very interesting articles from time to time on a variety of subjects, and today’s was “free trade.”  It’s called <a href="http://www.2000wave.com/index.asp">Draw the Curve, then Plot the Data</a>.  My response follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Read with interest your latest, “Draw the curve. ….” And the conclusion about trade:  “I am well aware that global free trade is not a one way ticket to prosperity for all. If it is your job that goes to another country, that affects you deeply. But the US as a whole has benefited tremendously from globalization, as has the world. And yes, some benefit more than others, but that is the nature of free market economics combined with technological change.”</p>
<p>Sorry, but that’s just orthodoxy and the same old propaganda of recent decades, in my own opinion.  (I’m not Alfred Einstein, but am a retired economist of the more practical sort – I worked on audits of very big corporations on their transfer pricing, for purposes of income declaration.  I’ve drawn a curve more than once.)</p>
<p>Here’s a curve to draw:  US trade balances from 1945 to the present.  Look at the last 40 years and tell me that we have free trade again.  Really?  Thirty years of negatives.  Massive transfers of technology offshore, wage arbitrage across borders (mass immigration and mass outsourcing), loss of entire swaths of industrial capacity, wages flat since the 1970’s.  I believe thirty years of experience ought to teach America something, and that is that we don’t have free trade.  We have manipulated trade, and a pattern of manipulated trade.  Changing this trend is not “protectionism” from trade, but a redirection of the rules of trade to make it more free.  </p>
<p>Vendor financing from Asia and Saudi Arabia for excess consumption over production means that the US , in both public and private sectors, have become the “sub-prime borrowers” of the world.  And do you truly believe this is a stable platform for future “growth” in US economy?  Really?  Because the US government can afford more interest payments on debt for now, does that mean we should keep increasing debt?  Why?</p>
<p>The expansion of the service sector of the economy is a reaction, not an action, and not a useful one.  I’m picking your fleas, you’re rotating Grandpa on his nursing home bed, Grandma’s darning socks, and Junior is polishing the boots of a Hedge Fund manager.  None of this is tradable, in the way required to bring our trade back into overall balance. </p>
<p>Status-quo trade advocates, meaning the beneficiaries and their pet economists, continue to talk about any intervention as “protectionism.”  They consistently overestimate the benefits of today’s trade and underestimate the costs, both industrial and social.  When prices paid by consumers are too low, they damage the economic decision making and the future investment decisions of industry – the same as prices too high also distort both consumption and investment.</p>
<p>Currency manipulation, either through artificially low interest rates as in Japan , or by direct intervention as in China and the Middle East oil producers, change end prices to consumers in the US .  So US consumers make very bad choices, and policy makers make very bad policies, and industry invests in every country but the US , and pretty soon you have a crisis.</p>
<p>I understand you may have great affection and respect for industrialists and economists who are putting out the “protectionism” message, and who scream we must maintain the status quo.  Don’t let it cloud your own judgment.  Saying “some benefit more than others” is just the sort of mindless elitism that has created the current grossly unbalanced trade situation.  Countries amount to more than the selfish interests of the movers and shakers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously the defenders of orthodox thought will disagree.  What about you?</p>

<p>Many on the left probably have not heard this story about Dianne <br />Feinstein since no one in the mainstream media has covered it.  But, from the <br />History Channel we have this: </p>
<blockquote><p>SEN. Dianne Feinstein has resigned from the Military Construction <br />Appropriations subcommittee. As previously and extensively reviewed in <br />these pages, Feinstein was chairperson and ranking member of MILCON for <br />six years, during which time she had a conflict of interest due to her <br />husband Richard C. Blum&#8217;s ownership of two major defense contractors, who <br />were awarded billions of dollars for military construction projects <br />approved by Feinstein.</p></blockquote>
<p>(<a href="http://boards.historychannel.com/thread.jspa?threadID=800019722&#038;tstart=75&#038;mod=1175130915646">Story here.</a>)  Ms Feinstein meet Duke Cunningham. </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>CoRev also asked me why we hadn&#8217;t written about this on Angry Bear yet.  My response, for what its worth ran something like:  We didn&#8217;t have all that many stories on Duke Cunningham either and that was in the news for months and months, if not years.  If this story lasts that long, no doubt it will come up on Angry Bear.</p>
<p>As an aside&#8230;  I should note&#8230; I&#8217;ve voted for Diane Feinstein, and Barbara Boxer.  I&#8217;m not happy voting for either of them, but all else equal I&#8217;d do it again given the apparently at-least-as-corrupt buffoons that the Republican Party of California insists on running against them.  I personally believe both of them are corrupt, and have believed it for a long time.  (Regular readers may recall a post in which I discussed my opinion of the Congress, and named the small number of names of individuals I thought I had reason to believe might be honest, including Tom Coburn, who I think may be honest but is just plain nuts.)</p>

                                <p>Seen at Economists’ View, Friday Mar 30:</p>
<p>Bryan Wysocki Jr at WSJ say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fueling the growth &#8230; is a move toward giant, complex projects, awarded by Uncle Sam but pulled together by what&#8217;s called a &#8220;lead systems integrator.&#8221; Big contractors have become even more powerful in the post-9/11 era, some say, because the government has turned conservative, preferring to award contracts on critical national-security projects to proven players, especially as knowledgeable civil servants retire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not conservative, rather business friendly.  Who decides who are the proven players?</p>
<p>Lead system integrator is new business development for the &#8220;major players&#8221;, the same old culprits, in government service contracts, a new growth sector.  It is politically and PAC motivated.  Private industry has been doing this for DoE in the national lab system for years and for FAA as well as NASA.  It is new to the national security business development model and more work for the shadow government while the real government ends up doing the same as it did before.</p>
<p>SAIC is marketing the idea that they can do better than the government planners, while planning is always a governmental function as it is the basis for funding and long term expenditure decisions and only makes sense to me to outsource if you want to plunder the treasury.</p>
<p>In the good old days the soldiers got their equipment from a Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE).  This was built from the company (200-250 soldiers) on up to the Battalion, made up of 4 or 5 somewhat similar TOE companies to the Brigade (now 4 or 5 battalions, used to be 2 or more battalions made regiment), up to a division with 4 to 6 Brigades.</p>
<p>The old days the TOE were built by Army staff guys.</p>
<p>Same kind of strategic thinking farmed out to the suppliers will be applied to the other services and homeland security.</p>
<p>The innovation is these resource lists are going to be done by SAIC, Boeing etc.</p>
<p>In many ways large global system engineering is the same as strategy development.  The tasks and functions are done to develop plans which become federal budgets.</p>
<p>A real mess when the evolution is to the contractors developing long terms plans for federal buying that they sell to.</p>
<p>This explains why soldiers don&#8217;t have adequate individual gear like body armour while we buy expensive solutions to fight WW II again.</p>

<p>In my fair city of Los Angeles, a lot of people speak Spanish.  And I have news for the former speaker of the House – their kids are learning English.  But if Newt thinks Spanish is the language of living in a ghetto, let me share some pictures from my favorite ghetto &#8211; <a href="http://www.red2000.com/spain/madrid/photo.html">Madrid</a>.</p>

                                <p>Update: <a href="http://www.rightintheshortrun.com/blog/2007/04/01/the-benefits-of-refusing-to-honor-patents">Adamess</a> proposes a price discrimination approach to monopoly drug pricing:</p>
<blockquote><p>The expected profits of research come mainly from the developed world, where countries are rich enough to pay the high prices that pharma charges for its medications. Developing countries are usually too poor to pay very much, and even if they might be able to pay, they may invalidate patents to avoid pharma’s markups. (To pharma, the possibility that countries refuse to honor patents simply reduces expected profitability.)</p></blockquote>
<p>I would argue we already have a differential markup approach but it’s not Big Pharma that is choosing the varying markups – but rather the decisions of local government.  Profit maximizing monopolists prefer to control how they price discriminate and not let governments control such matters.  </p>
<p>*****************************</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/03/newsweek_tortures_english_lang.html#016091">Dean Baker</a>, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17886719/site/newsweek">George Wehrfritz</a> reports on the approach that Thailand has taken towards the marketing of patented drugs:</p>
<blockquote><p>the generals are now winning points worldwide for an attack on pharmaceutical giants like Merck, Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers Squibb. By invoking vague World Trade Organization rules that allow governments to void drug patents during public- health emergencies, Bangkok has since November approved generic production of two popular anti-AIDS drugs and one blood thinner, slashing their cost to patients by up to 90 percent. Bangkok is now urging companies to begin discounting other drugs; Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla warned last month that &#8220;if negotiations fail, we are ready to act.&#8221; Experts have likened the WTO drug rules to nuclear weapons &#8211; deterrents best never used. Since the rules came into effect in 2001, drug companies have largely avoided becoming targets by slashing prices or extending royalty-free licenses to poor nations.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a bit of a self-contradiction here.  Several nations establish market structures where the pharmaceutical companies are not allowed an unregulated monopoly for their patented products.  Whether the threat of not extending patent protection or price controls are the reasons why these pharmaceutical companies sell their products at lower prices, not allowing unregulated monopoly power is a rather common place practice.  Mr. Wehrfritz presents both sides of this debate:</p>
<blockquote><p>Humanitarian groups like Oxfam and Doctors Without Borders argue that overpriced meds can cripple public-health budgets in emerging nations like Thailand as well as in poorer places, and have encouraged other governments to follow Bangkok&#8217;s lead. But Western governments are alarmed &#8230; &#8220;This is a massive political movement against intellectual property,&#8221; says Philip Stevens, director of the health program at the International Policy Network, a London-based think tank. &#8220;It&#8217;s not specific to Thailand, and it seeks to make medicine into public, not private, goods.&#8221; &#8230; In a 2006 study, the World Bank predicted that despite a model AIDS-prevention program, Thailand would see a surge in costs as the virus grows resistant to older antiretroviral drugs. New, patented drugs would drive up the yearly cost per patient from $481 to more than $6,700 because they&#8217;re not available in generic form &#8230; The nationalistic generals put generic production into the hands of a state-owned manufacturer with a track record of producing substandard copies that speed up resistance in AIDS patients. And they began pushing to make generics not only for AIDS drugs, but also for cancer and heart medications and antibiotics. A top health official suggested recently that patents on some 15 percent of rights-protected drugs now sold in Thailand could be eventually suspended. &#8220;Their aim is to make Thailand a regional manufacturing hub [for generics],&#8221; says Ste-vens. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of industrial policy and self-interest here.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean applauds the decision of the Thai government:</p>
<blockquote><p>By eliminating patent monopolies on several AIDS drugs, as well as a few other medications, Thailand was able to reduce prices by close to two-thirds.  Naturally, the drug industry is furious over the possibility that their patent monopolies may not be protected. Newsweek apparently shares the drug industry&#8217;s anger, telling readers that &#8220;advocates of free trade see Thailand&#8217;s move as a big threat.&#8221; Actually, any real advocate of free trade, almost by definition, would have to applaud Thailand&#8217;s action. After all, the Thai government is eliminating a government imposed monopoly and allowing drugs to sell at prices that are much closer to their free market level.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sure we’ll here from others why the protection of intellectual property rights is important.  I’ll try to pass along the other side of this debate when they do.</p>
