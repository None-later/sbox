<blockquote><p>The Psychoanalytic Couple and Family Institute of New England (PCFINE), with the support of other psychoanalytic groups throughout the country, has launched a new pro bono program called SOFAR: Strategic Outreach to Families of All Reservists. Through this program, SOFAR coordinates the delivery of psychotherapy and psycho-educational services to the families of Reservists and National Guard members who are stationed in or returning from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait.<br />The goal of SOFAR is to provide a flexible and diverse range of psychological services that fosters stabilization, aid in formulating prevention plans to avoid crises, and help families to manage acute problems effectively when they occur. Our highest priority is to help families to develop and maintain coping skills during the phases of Alert, Mobilization/Activation, Deployment and Reunion/Reintegration. Clinicians will be available to provide individual and family therapy and lead support groups targeted for families, mothers and parents on such topics as stress management, anger management and general coping skills.<br />SOFAR aims to reduce stress on Reservists and Guard Members by letting them know that SOFAR is there to support their families when the need arises. The program is beginning with more than 70 credentialed volunteers who are meeting with members of Family Readiness Groups of the Army Reserves, based in the Boston, MA and surrounding communities. Families of Army Reservists have received information about the program and are encouraged to contact the program by calling us at 617-266-2611 to request an assignment to one of the participating clinicians in the Greater Boston area. All families will be guaranteed strictly confidentiality within the limits of the law.<br />Once a family member requests services from SOFAR, the clinician will conduct an assessment and develop a treatment plan for the individual and/or family. The family member and the clinician will negotiate the duration and frequency of services to best meet the needs of the family with the resources SOFAR can provide. Should the family require additional community resources, the clinician will assist in making referrals to appropriate services.<br />Once the program has been assessed and appropriate changes made to accommodate the needs of the population, SOFAR will work to replicate the program nationally through the 27 local chapters of Division of Psychoanalysis (39) of the American Psychological Association and the 31 institutes of the American Psychoanalytic Association.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It is a well kept secret that Bechtel won a contract to privatize the water in Ecuador&#8217;s largest city, Guayaquil, just months after the massive citizen protests that threw Bechtel out of Bolivia.<br />In October 2000, a local Bechtel subsidiary, Interagua, signed a 30-year concession contract to run the water and sanitation services in Guayaquil. The privatization process was promoted by loans from the Inter-American Development Bank and a guarantee from the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a World Bank agency.<br />Now, more than six years later, the residents of Guayaquil are demanding damages from the company for water contamination, an end to water cut-offs, and a return to local, public control.<br />&#8230;<br />Interagua&#8217;s operations in Guayaquil earned $300 million in revenue. Despite these profits, Interagua did not initiate the rehabilitation programs it had promised. Concerns and complaints mounted over broken pipelines, floods due to malfunctioning sewage systems, exorbitant water rates, poor water quality, and environmental damage due to the lack of wastewater treatment during this first five-year period.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suppose there is no proof public or a public-private partnership would have done better, but it does not add to Bechtel&#8217;s resume. While there were humanitarian concerns, that was not the market failure. They did not spend the money on contract items.</p>

                                <p>Three Kentucky lawyers are sitting in a Kentucky jail on multiple fraud charges in relation to a Fen-phen malpractice suit (a discredited diet drug).</p>
<p>After settlement the lawyers lied to the victims, and told some of the victims that discussing the settlement with anyone else was a criminal act subject to jail terms. Nice thing to do to sick people.</p>
<p>It seems that of a $200 million settlement the lawyers ate up $150 million or so, while lying to the victims about the terms of the settlement. There are allegations that the lawyers created a charity with a paid board seat for the state court trial judge.</p>
<p>This case got lots of publicity not because the victims were slammed but because the lawyers used some of the money to buy a piece of Curlin, a famous race horse from the 2006 season, while victims were still awaiting funds to pay medical bills.</p>
<p>There was a small amount of justice in the case when the lawyers started fightin amount themselves, over the money of course.</p>
<p>The federal district court trial judge will not allow the lawyers to post bail because they have been stonewalling about the whereabouts of some of the money.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought for years that civil court settlements over $xx should be subject to a CPA review for proper distribution, and that all class action settlements should be reviewed. I&#8217;ve done this sort of review for a court when a juvenile was an accident victim. If everything is honest the cost isn&#8217;t that high.</p>
<p>This would, of course, drive the trial lawyers into a frenzy. But what about the victims?</p>

                                <p>You hear this a lot from his supporters, but I agree with <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/11/journalism_as_sadism.php">Matthew Yglesias</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The crux of the matter is this reputation for being a &#8220;tough questioner&#8221; and the notion that Russert&#8217;s brand of toughness is worthy of emulation. And it&#8217;s true that Russert is a tough questioner. Watch any Russert-moderated debate or a typical candidate appearance on Meet The Press and you&#8217;ll see that he goes way out of the way to put the politician in a tough corner &#8211; he&#8217;ll ask about some unimportant issue that&#8217;s politically awkward, he&#8217;ll drag up a quote from five years ago to try to trip you up, he&#8217;ll ask about stuff your husband said, he&#8217;ll harp on whatever recent story has most damaged your candidacy &#8211; he&#8217;s tough. But while I wouldn&#8217;t want to say that &#8220;tough questioning&#8221; is a bad thing, making toughness the goal is perverse. The goal should be to inform the audience &#8230; Russert doesn&#8217;t care &#8211; at all &#8211; about whether or not his actions inform the American electorate. Rather, he cares about creating a &#8220;news-making&#8221; event &#8212; likely something embarrassing for the politician &#8212; and about burnishing his reputation for toughness. He attracts a circle of admirers who share his perverse and unethical lack of concern for whether or not his work helps produce an informed public, gobs of less-prominent television journalists seek to emulate his lack of concern with informing the public, print journalists eagerly court opportunities to appear on the non-informative shows hosted by Russert and his emulators, and down the rabbit hole we go.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_11/012488.php">Kevin Drum</a> says this is a stale and clownish version of gotcha journalism adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>The gotcha routine, no matter who it comes from, is bad for everyone, both Republicans and Democrats. Second, Russert&#8217;s schtick perpetuates the idea that the worst possible sin in a politician is displaying even a hint of inconsistency. But you know what? It turns out there are worse things. Obviously politicians should be held accountable for their words, but Russert and his colleagues ought to focus a little more on what&#8217;s really important and a little less on what somebody said in 1998.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fire Tim Russert.  Fire him now.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://aldaily.com/">Arts &#038; Letters Daily</a>, a link to an article by Alan Krueger in The American entitled <a rhef="http://www.american.com/archive/2007/november-december-magazine-contents/what-makes-a-terrorist">What Makes a Terrorist</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project conducted public opinion surveys in February 2004 in Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, and Turkey, involving about 1,000 respondents in each country. One of the questions asked was, “What about suicide bombing carried out against Americans and other Westerners in Iraq? Do you personally believe that this is justifiable or not justifiable?” Pew kindly provided me with tab­ulations of these data by respondents’ personal characteristics.</p>
<p>The clear finding was that people with a higher level of education are in general more likely to say that suicide attacks against Westerners in Iraq are justified. I have also broken this pattern down by income level. There is no indication that people with higher incomes are less likely to say that sui­cide-bombing attacks are justified.</p>
<p>Another source of opinion data is the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, headquar­tered in Ramallah. The center collects data in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. One question, asked in December 2001 of 1,300 adults, addressed attitudes toward armed attacks on Israeli tar­gets. Options were “strongly support,” “support,” “oppose,” “strongly oppose,” or “no opinion.”</p>
<p>Support turned out to be stronger among those with a higher level of education. For exam­ple, while 26 percent of illiterates and 18 per­cent of those with only an elementary education opposed or strongly opposed armed attacks, the figure for those with a high school education was just 12 percent. The least supportive group turned out to be the unemployed, 74 percent of whom said they support or strongly back armed attacks. By comparison, the support level for merchants and professionals was 87 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then provides evidence that members of terrorists generally are more well-to-do than the greater population from which they derive.  Which leads to:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why are better educated, more advan­taged individuals more likely than others to join terrorist groups? I think of terrorism as a market, with a supply side and a demand side. Individuals, either in small groups or on their own, supply their services to terrorist organizations.</p>
<p>On the supply side, the economics of crime suggests that people with low opportunity costs will become involved in terrorism. Their costs of involvement are lower—that is, they sacrifice less because their prospects of living a rich life are less. In other domains of life, it is those with few oppor­tunities who are more likely to commit property crime and resort to suicide.</p>
<p>However, in the case of the supply of terrorists, while consideration of opportunity cost is not irrel­evant, it is outweighed by other factors, such as a commitment to the goals of the terrorist organi­zation and a desire to make a statement. Political involvement requires some understanding of the issues, and learning about those issues is a less costly endeavor for those who are better educated. I argue that better analogies than crime are vot­ing and political protest. Indeed, better educated, employed people are more likely to vote.</p>
<p>On the demand side, terrorist organizations want to succeed. The costs of failure are high. So the organizations select more able participants—which again points to those who are better educated and better off economically.</p>
<p>One of the conclusions from the work of Laurence Iannaccone—whose paper, “The Market for Martyrs,” is supported by my own research—is that it is very difficult to effect change on the supply side. People who are willing to sacrifice themselves for a cause have diverse motivations. Some are motivated by nationalism, some by religious fanati­cism, some by historical grievances, and so on. If we address one motivation and thus reduce one source on the supply side, there remain other motivations that will incite other people to terror.</p>
<p>That suggests to me that it makes sense to focus on the demand side, such as by degrading terrorist organizations’ financial and technical capabili­ties, and by vigorously protecting and promoting peaceful means of protest, so there is less demand for pursuing grievances through violent means. Policies intended to dampen the flow of people willing to join terrorist organizations, by contrast, strike me as less likely to succeed.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Consistent with the work on international terrorist incidents, countries with fewer civil lib­erties and political rights were more likely to be the birthplaces of foreign insurgents. Distance also mattered, with most foreign insurgents com­ing from nearby nations. The model predicted that the largest number of insurgents—44 percent—would have emanated from Saudi Arabia, a nation not known for its protection of civil liberties but with a high GDP per capita.</p>
<p>The evidence suggests that terrorists care about influencing political outcomes. They are often motivated by geopolitical grievances. To under­stand who joins terrorist organizations, instead of asking who has a low salary and few opportunities, we should ask: Who holds strong political views and is confident enough to try to impose an extrem­ist vision by violent means? Most terrorists are not so desperately poor that they have nothing to live for. Instead, they are people who care so fervently about a cause that they are willing to die for it.</p></blockquote>
<p>And I would add one thing, a comment I made a few days ago about US support for dictatorial regimes.  People with a boot on their neck remember, for a very long time, who paid for that boot.</p>

<blockquote><p>During his November 11 Meet the Press interview with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama (IL) on NBC&#8217;s Meet the Press, host Tim Russert asserted that &#8220;critics will say you&#8217;ve not been a leader against the war,&#8221; and then read a quote he attributed to Obama: &#8220;In July of 2004, Barack Obama: &#8216;I&#8217;m not privy to Senate intelligence reports. &#8230; What would I have done? I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; in terms of how you would have voted on the war.&#8221; After quoting two other Obama statements on the war, Russert concluded: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem that you were firmly wedded against the war and that you left some wiggle room that, if you were in the Senate, you may have voted for it.&#8221; However, in citing Obama&#8217;s comment &#8220;What would I have done? I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Russert did not quote the very next sentence of Obama&#8217;s statement, which was, &#8220;What I know is that from my vantage point the case [for authorizing the war] was not made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope Senator Obama’s campaign for this sheer dishonesty on the part of Mr. Russert.  But only after the Senator apologizes to Senator Clinton for that driver’s license flair up during the last Democratic debate.  <a href="http://www.mclaughlin.com/library/transcript.asp?id=623">John McLaughlin</a> explained why during the taping of <em>The McLaughlin Group</em> on November 2, 2007:</p>
<blockquote><p>Issue Two: The Non-Smoking Gun. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s tough to be number one, and Hillary Clinton is the number one Democratic contender for president. All the polls say so. So her rivals, Democrats all, tried to trap the senator with the smoking gun of double-talking out of both sides of her mouth. They targeted the issue of whether New York driver&#8217;s licenses should be granted to illegal immigrants in New York State. </p>
<p>By the way, there are over 500,000 illegal immigrants in New York State. </p>
<p>(Begin videotaped segment.) </p>
<p>TIM RUSSERT (NBC News): Do you, the New York senator, Hillary Clinton, support the New York governor&#8217;s plan to give illegal immigrants a driver&#8217;s license? You told the New Hampshire paper it made a lot of sense. Do you support his plan? </p>
<p>SEN. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D-NY): You know, Tim, this is where everybody plays &#8220;gotcha.&#8221; It makes a lot of sense. What is the governor supposed to do? He is dealing with a serious problem. We have failed, and George Bush has failed. </p>
<p>(End videotaped segment.) </p>
<p>DR. MCLAUGHLIN: We&#8217;ve all seen repeatedly the videotaped sequence on the alleged inconsistency in what Hillary said. So let&#8217;s go to Nashua. Tim Russert built his question out of Hillary&#8217;s comments to a newspaper editorial board in Nashua, New Hampshire. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Hillary said at Nashua: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s important to bring everybody out of the shadows, to do the background checks, to deport those who have outstanding warrants or have committed crimes in the United States, and then to say to those who wish to stay here, &#8216;You have to pay back taxes. You have to pay a fine. You have to learn English, and you have to wait in line.&#8217; And I hate to see any state being pushed to try to take this into their own hands because the federal government has failed. </p>
<p>&#8220;So I know exactly what Governor Spitzer is trying to do, and it makes a lot of sense, because he&#8217;s trying to get people out of the shadows. He&#8217;s trying to say, &#8216;Okay, come forward and we will give you this license.&#8217; But without a federal policy in effect, people will come forward and they could get picked up by ICE&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency &#8211; &#8220;tomorrow. I mean, this cannot work state by state. It has to be looked at comprehensively.&#8221; </p>
<p>Now, the question is, are there any differences between what she said in Nashua and what she said at the Democratic debate? I ask you, Eleanor. MS. CLIFT: Well, you can&#8217;t tell whether she&#8217;s for it or against it in that long response. And what she&#8217;s doing is &#8212; </p>
<p>DR. MCLAUGHLIN: I disagree with you. </p>
<p>MS. CLIFT: Well, she&#8217;s </p>
<p>DR. MCLAUGHLIN: If you analyze the language, she&#8217;s in favor of what Spitzer&#8217;s generally doing to bring aliens out of the darkness. </p>
<p>MR. ZUCKERMAN: The shadows. </p>
<p>MS. CLIFT: Yeah, but she says that in the context of the larger issue that it&#8217;s not a good idea state by state.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well – this needs to be done at the Federal level so Senator Clinton was getting this right.  Of course, once Russert dishonestly opened the door with his cherry picked gotcha, a sleaze ball candidate would have pounced on it.  I never thought of John Edwards and Senator Obama as sleaze balls – but pounced they did.  We also heard GOP sleaze Rudy Giuliani praising Obama as he also dishonestly attacked Senator Clinton.  While one would expect such garbage from Giuliani, I was shocked at the dishonesty from John Edwards and Senator Obama.  <strong>Shame on both of them.</strong>  </p>
<p>But seriously – why on earth does Tim Russert have a job at any outfit outside of Faux News?  This is nothing new from this hack.  <em>Meet the Press</em> used to be a stellar Sunday news interview show.  It could still be – once NBC fires Tim Russert.</p>

<p>U.S. business cycles do not follow some smooth form of a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sine.html">sine function</a> even if one annoying rightwing troll insists they do.  I was thinking about how to express this in terms of the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/11/tom-bozzo-defends-bob-herbert.html">employment-population</a> (EP) ratio when <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/11/why-stop-at-1990-for-ep-ratio.html">Divorced one like Bush</a> made this easier for me with:</p>
<blockquote><p>1948 to 1960 vacillation within a range of 1 point (55 to 56). Then the nation got use to an ever increasing E/P ratio from around 1960 to 2000.</p></blockquote>
<p>My read of the data goes a little differently.  As I see the data from 1948 to 1975, the EP ratio hovered about 56.6 percent and then went on an upward march to its 64 percent in early 1998.  Now I have suggested in the past that the natural rate of EP has been around 64 percent from 1998 onwards but I would seriously doubt that the natural rate of EP was 64 percent during either the Carter recession, the Reagan recession, or the Bush41 recession.</p>
<p>Now while this is certainly not a perfect way of capturing the natural rate, let’s postulate that the natural rate was 56.6 percent in December 1975, was 64 percent from January 1997 onwards, and steadily increased from 56.6 percent to 64 percent during the intervening months.  We then get our second graph which tries to capture the difference between the natural and actual rates. </p>
<p>Based on this metric, the Bush41 recession and subsequent recovery looks quite different from the 2001 recession and its aftermath.  One difference is that the gap between the natural rate of EP (or EP*) was only 1 percent in late 1992 and early 1993, while it reached 2 percent by September 2003.  Another difference relates to how fast we returned to the natural rate.  During the Clinton recovery, this took only two years.  Two years after the gap began coming down during the Bush43 recovery, we’d gotten only half way there.  OK, the gap continued to fall for the next year plus but we still had a gap as of the end of 2006.</p>
<p>There is one slight similarity.  Midway in Clinton’s first term, the FED decided to raise interest rates so the gap reappeared for a while during 1995.  But we returned to full employment in 1996 and 1997 before having what may have been a very strong labor market.  The FED also started raising interest rates during Bush43’s second term even before we got back to full employment.  So what little progress we saw in getting back to full employment has seen an about face during the first three quarters of this year.  </p>
<p>Beyond this slight similarity, it should be clear to most that the most recent business cycle is not at all like what happened during the 1990’s.  But then this should be no surprise as not all business cycles are alike – unless you are some rightwing troll who learned all of his economics at the feet of Donald Luskin.</p>

                                <p>We have a long history. Why not see what this nation was truly use to before we decide whether the opportunity (chance?) to be employed is good, bad or indifferent? I went to the department of labor site and used their graphing for the following charts.<br />First 1948 to 2007 E/P Ratio.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Rzd22ITbf6I/AAAAAAAAAE0/vYYgWVEmD_k/s1600-h/EP+Ratio+1948+to+2007.gif"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Rzd22ITbf6I/AAAAAAAAAE0/vYYgWVEmD_k/s400/EP+Ratio+1948+to+2007.gif" border="0"></a>What we see is 3 distinct groupings. 1948 to 1960 vacillation within a range of 1 point (55 to 56). Then the nation got use to an ever increasing E/P ratio from around 1960 to 2000. But, if we start with 1990, then yes, we are seeing a new level of vacillation. Thus, we have 30 years of ever greater (opportunity for) employment for our citizens changing to approaching 20 years of hit or miss. So, using the last 17 years, Brad and PGL are on safe ground. Using the full series, citizens are not seeing it so good as to their future. Have we not moved down the rankings of upward mobility?</p>
<div></div>
<p>Lets break it out male vs female, 20 years and older.

<p>Very similar curves other than the female starting at a lower number.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But, here are their E/P ratios.
<div>This is the Male EP ratio.</p>

<p>The men go from a high of 86.6 to a low of 70.6 in 1983 and hovers 1 point +/- at 73 although the over all trend since 1990 has been down.<br />The women go from a low of 30.1 in 1948 to a high of 58.6 2000 and 2001 and did not go below 57.1 after. But even for women, since 1990 the climb has been shallower with a flattening since 1996.</div>
<div>Wonder where the disconnect has been? I think we&#8217;re seeing it. As a family, 2 people working were climbing from the 60&#8217;s to 1990. Since then, and especially after 1996 with the female curve flattening, it just seems that the American citizen is not interested in working?  Or maybe they realize that working more is not getting them any more.  Maybe they have decided not to participate in the race to the top.  Or maybe this reflexs the lack of jobs making working worth the effort.  What ever it is, we&#8217;re flat and not growing.</div>

<p>Today&#8217;s WaPo had an article <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/09/AR2007110901940.html">Gift of thanks for the Troops</a> an article by Army major Elizabeth L. Robbins.  In it are a couple of keeper quotes.  Simple things do make a difference.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Those of us overseas know that &#8220;support the troops&#8221; is more than a slogan. Here we are besieged by what my master sergeant calls &#8220;paper love,&#8221; the cards, letters, posters and other gestures of support sent by people across America. The paper love is often accompanied by packages of snacks and comfort items.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this one on the effect of such gratitude. <br />
<blockquote>Cynics might think these expressions of goodwill from strangers are hokey, but they are tacked on the walls of nearly every workspace, living area and hospital ward in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230; </p>
<blockquote><p>This past May, a young soldier received several hundred tributes drawn by children at McNair Elementary School in Herndon, Va., where his mother does volunteer work. He taped them up along a hallway at Multi-National Force-Iraq headquarters, forming the letters T-H-A-N-K Y-O-U.</p>
<p>Members of our coalition partners&#8217; armed forces congregated in the hallway looking at the posters with wonder. They asked passersby, &#8220;American children send these to you? They are so beautiful!&#8221; Some shook their heads and confessed that they were stunned at the support we enjoy from our people back home.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if you are not already supporting our troops, please reconsider.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an excellent and easy to accomplish approach to support that helps some of our most needy troops:  <a href="http://soldiersangels.org/index.php?page=valour-it-donations">Valour IT</a> provides voice activated laptop computers for our wounded vets.</p>

<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/11/can-we-retire-b.html">Brad DeLong</a> had a number of critics of a recent op-ed from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/opinion/10herbert.html?_r=2&#038;th=&#038;oref=slogin&#038;emc=th&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;oref=slogin">Bob Herbert</a>.   While <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2007/11/i-give-this-one-to-herbert.html">Tom Bozzo</a> didn’t go after the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/11/whats-in-your-consumer-price-index.html">CPI claim</a>, he did offer a counter to almost everything else Brad complained about. </p>
<p>I’ll let others decide who is more correct on most of these, but Tom offers up several of my posts on the employment-population ratio as evidence that Herbert’s claim is right and Brad’s complaint is misguided.  Let’s recall that Herbert said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The job market has been weak for years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now let’s see what Brad said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The job market has not been as strong as the unemployment rate suggests, but it has not been extraordinarily weak.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our graph shows the employment-population ratio from January 1997 to September 2007.  My view is that the 64 percent plus employment-population ratio that we saw before the 2001 recession was an exceptionally strong labor market.  Surely, the labor market was quite weak in 2002 and 2003.  We saw some improvement over the next three years with the employment to population ratio reaching 63.4 percent by December 2006.  Several of our conservative economist blogger friends were suggesting that we were near full employment at that time.  I have also expressed concern that the labor market strength has been slipping since then.  On almost every AB post Tom provides, I got the sense that Brad had a very similar view.  For Mr. Herbert to say that the job market has been weak for years is not entirely accurate in my view.  I think Brad’s statement is.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: At Brad DeLong&#8217;s suggestion, I have extended the graph so that it starts in January 1990.  Thanks Brad for the suggestion.</p>
