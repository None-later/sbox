<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;refer=home&#038;sid=ahE8xVisWsbE">Here’s a little story about Wall Street that won’t last long</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shareholders in the securities industry are having their worst year since 2002, losing $74 billion of their equity. That won&#8217;t prevent Wall Street from paying record bonuses, totaling almost $38 billion.</p>
<p>That money, split among about 186,000 workers at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch &#038; Co., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos., equates to an average of $201,500 per person, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The five biggest U.S. securities firms paid $36 billion to employees last year.</p>
<p>The bigger bonus pool derives from a record $9 billion of fees for arranging acquisitions and $5 billion for underwriting initial public offerings and sales of junk bonds, the most lucrative securities, Bloomberg data show. Bankers&#8217; record fees help explain why 2007 will prove to be the industry&#8217;s second- most profitable after the subprime mortgage market collapse led to losses at Merrill and Bear Stearns. The last time bonuses declined was 2002 when the Standard &#038; Poor&#8217;s 500 Index fell 23 percent, and Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. went bankrupt. </p></blockquote>
<p>The usual argument for lavish remuneration is that those who are so well paid are those who make so much money for their customers.  Hey, Mr. Boiler Room Man, where’s my cash?  What’s that you’re stuffing in your pocket?</p>

<p>(Hat tip to<br /><a href="http://theissue.com/inreader.php?inreaderpage=botbinreader&#038;page=arstechnica.com%2Fjournals%2Fscience.ars%2F2007%2F11%2F09%2Frethinking-desalination&#038;storyid=5377">The Issue</a>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Last month saw the release of a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071027-new-un-environmental-report-paints-a-very-bleak-future-for-humanity.html">UN report</a> that paints a very bleak picture of how humans are shepherding natural resources on the planet. One of the greatest causes for concern is our use of fresh water, without which life is impossible.<br />Demands for fresh water come from both agriculture and drinking, with agriculture currently using almost 70 percent of global fresh water. The world&#8217;s population is estimated to grow to nine billion within 50 years, meaning we&#8217;re going to need to double the amount of fresh water for agriculture in order to feed everyone, according to the UN. Although desalination is often pointed to as the answer to this problem, a new paper published in Science suggests we are going to need to think again.<br />Israel is a world leader in desalination; this desert nation recently opened the world&#8217;s largest desalination plant at Ashkelon, which produces 100,000,000 m3 of desalinized water each year by reverse osmosis. The massive scale of the plant also makes its product the cheapest so far, with production costs below $0.55/m3.<br />Unfortunately, it seems that what passes for fresh water for drinking isn&#8217;t good enough to be used for agriculture. Israeli farmers have discovered that although Na+ and Cl- have been removed, so too has Mg2+, essential for plant growth. As if that weren&#8217;t bad enough, boron concentrations have increased. Although boron poses no threat to human health, most crops aren&#8217;t so lucky.<br />Last but not least, the altered ion balance in the desalinized water results in water that is less buffered, meaning that the pipes that carry it corrode faster. Although none of these problems are insurmountable, they will all result in greater costs, and in regions where millions already live below the poverty line, that&#8217;s not a good thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>I realize these technical problems in all probability can be compensated for through engineering.  I also remember the promises of the &#8216;Green Revolution&#8217; of bounty without unintended or ignored consequences.  Projects small scale often obscure major flaws because we did not know what to look for or consider important.  If farmers missed this aspect, what chance us cityboys and girls?  After all, some still want to drain the Great Lakes to subsidize other locations, without even considering the huge expense of moving water from one river to another in the same watershed.</p>
<p>With water at about $120 a foot acre or $1.50 cents per 1000 gal.(sewerage is $4.50 per 1000 gal.), de-salination is about 4-5 times the cost of current kinds of prices in the US.  If unsubsidized by governments, prices go up considerably.</p>

                                <p>Way back when, we had a President who said this during a Q&#038;A at a factory owned by one of his supporters:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m concerned about anybody who&#8217;s not working and wants to work.  And so we&#8217;ll let the numbers talk.  But in terms of policy and the focus of this administration, we&#8217;re going to do everything we can to increase jobs so people can find work.</p>
<p>One of the reasons we came here is Mike, in the midst of a significant downturn in his business, laid nobody off.  There wasn&#8217;t one layoff at America II.  If he was &#8212; well, you know, what about the numbers?  Well, the numbers here show that he was in a big slowdown.  Sales dropped by 40 percent.  And yet, he understood his responsibility as a decent citizen, and nobody got laid off.</p></blockquote>
<p>That President was <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020308-3.html">GW</a> in March of 2002.  </p>
<p>Employers have a responsibility to their employees as decent citizens?  GW said that? Has he ever said anything about those employers who weren&#8217;t what he would call decent citizens?</p>

                                <p>As I type this, I have before me a document entitled &#8220;A Statement on Communism&#8221; dated March 27, 1967, by John Edgar Hoover, then director of FBI.  (Sorry&#8230; no links&#8230; all I have is a hard copy.)  </p>
<p>Some excerpts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Inside the United States there is today an aggressive, bold and highly confident Communist Party.  Organized in 1919 at a convention in Chicago, Illinois, the Party has always been obediently loyal to Moscow.  At this moment, its officers and members, along with thousands of sympathizers or &#8220;state of mind members,&#8221; form a phalanx of treason in our midst.  The Party is working in every possible way to infiltrate, subvert and destroy our democratic form of government. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Actually, the communists are desperately seeking to change their public image &#8212; to be accepted as legitimate elements of our society.  Let&#8217;s be careful.  Remember that communists are not loyal to our democratic traditions.  They come as wolves garbed in sheep&#8217;s clothing.  Despite what they say, in beguiling language, they hate and detest the United States.  Their chief interest is not to build, to make a better Nation, but to wreck and destroy.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The language is the same, but at least the enemy was a world power, not cave dwellers and fanatics living in the 11th century.   But they walk among us &#8211; that&#8217;s a constant.  And there are always some deluded fanatics who fancy themselves capable of bringing down a large power like the US with a childish philosophy, and there are always fearful individuals who manage to be afraid of them.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the cross-dresser said about epic battles&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Americans should be proud of their country.  All too often today patriotism is regarded as old-fashioned, out of date, not to be taken seriously.  Nothing could be more wrong.  America needs citizens who will stand up and be counted, who are willing to do their share for the common good.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>No man has a right to a &#8220;time out,&#8221; a &#8220;leave of absence&#8221; &#8212; all must be on the front lines.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which leads us to a more recent, but already <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/05_01_30_corner-archive.asp#055419">classic call to epic battle</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for why my sorry a** isn&#8217;t in the kill zone, lots of people think this is a searingly pertinent question. No answer I could give &#8212; I&#8217;m 35 years old, my family couldn&#8217;t afford the lost income, I have a baby daughter, my a** is, er, sorry, are a few &#8212; ever seem to suffice.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Yves Smith over at Naked Capitalism has been following the sub-prime meltdown.  As part of that, today he looks at a speech by <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/11/feds-gary-stern-makes-lame-arguments.html">Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern</a>.  An excerpt from his post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even though regulation entails costs in terms of reduced efficiency and reduced profitability, the scale of the damage argues for incurring those costs. Yet, incredibly, Stern is arguing against meaningful change despite overwhelming evidence of serious problems.  How can that be?</p>
<p>I can come up with only three rationales:</p>
<blockquote><p>    1. The debate has gotten away from the Fed and is being driven by Congress. Stern is trying to tell the pols not to stick their noses in matters that are over their pretty little heads. While this is plausible, I don&#8217;t see Fed officials taking the steps needed for them to influence the debate around regulatory reform. You can&#8217;t expect legislators with very unhappy constituents to do nothing.</p>
<p>    2. Stern recognizes that what our financial system is what Richard Bookstaber, in his book Demon of Our Own Design, called a &#8220;tightly coupled system,&#8221; like a nuclear reactor. In tightly-coupled systems, measures to increase safety can often have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>    3. Stern (and likely his Fed colleagues) believe in a lightly regulated system and are unwilling to back the level of intervention and oversight that is needed to effect fundamental change.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the rationale for Stern&#8217;s posture may be 2, I believe the real reason for his belief is 3. He and his colleagues have grown up in a regime that sees minimal government intervention as virtuous, and find it difficult to consider anything else. While it is an ideological bias, it is so pervasive that many wouldn&#8217;t even recognize it as a belief system. It&#8217;s simply what is widely held to be good practice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Go read the rest.</p>

<p>Call me a Monkey’s Uncle.  Out of pure frustration with the name calling debate on immigration, I can’t help wanting to tweak some tails.</p>
<p>My daughter LittleVet is French/American and lives in Paris .  She has a living great-grandfather named Franz who is German and a former Luftwaffe pilot in WWII who learned a bit of English as a POW working in Louisiana cane fields.  She has a grandfather on the other side named Mohammed who lives in Algeria .  One great grandmother on my side emigrated from Bremen after the turn of the century in 1905, and other relatives emigrated as indentured servants from debtor’s prisons in Paris .  The wheel turns for LittleVet.  I’ve lived as a guest in eight foreign territories outside the US .  Moving around the world is something I understand in my bones.  This year I was told by my more liberal brother that I was becoming a “populist demagogue” and by my conservative brother that I was a “liberal social engineer.”  My sister told me I was “some sort of Libertarian capitalist.”  Who, me?  What is going on here?</p>
<p>Yesterday my neighbor Joe complained about lawsuits brought against our sheriff in Tennessee, who routinely picks up illegal immigrants found during arrests and turns them over to ICE.  Joe lost his job after 32 years last year when his factory shut down and moved to Mexico and his firm invested in a new plant in Russia rather than here at home.  He’s got a high school education.  I heard a young couple with a child &#8211; one white, one black, and one mixed &#8211; worrying about how to find jobs while we ate in a “meat-and-three” diner this week.  I heard virulent anti-immigrant rhetoric on “talk radio” as I drove into town one day, from a Rush Limbaugh wanna-be.  Joe and I were discussing the qualities of fire wood when Joe’s best friend from the plant pulled up – he was black.  They both talked about a mini-wave of Mexican crimes with Joe’s nephew, who is a cop, and they were worried about it.  What about my many Cuban immigrant friends and former co-workers in Miami?  One Cuban asked me what the churches were offering sanctuary to Mexicans for, from poverty?  He said the best cure for poverty was hard work, and if people wanted to be citizens, they should follow the same rules as everybody else.  A Mexican perfectly legal immigrant whose son used to help us plant trees, and whose daughter was valedictorian of her university graduating class, said the same thing last year.  The medical, educational, and policing costs are treated as the only costs of mass immigration, rather than the job losses and job downgrades and the loss of technological innovation in service industries.</p>
<p>I read blogs that call any anti-immigration writer “racist, xenophobe, and nativist.”  Virtually every economist of note whose works I read, and most intellectually interesting writers on politics, line up firmly in the camp of wide open immigration.  Labor unions, leaders of corporate America, both Democrats and Republicans, want open borders.  Church leaders talk about “sanctuary” for cities and churches to hide illegal immigrants on the run.  Virtually every leading politician wants some version of amnesty for those in the US without papers.  Technological innovation in low-tech service industries in the US is as close to Zero as you can get, and cheap labor is used as a substitute for capital investment in education or equipment.  Crowded cities are flooded with more poor people looking for jobs.  Religious leaders want more credulous minds and donors filling their pews in church, and labor unions want a flood of fresh laborers to swell their ranks.  Business elites from Bill Gates to Jack Welch to the WalMart Waltons want cheaper labor and higher profits.  College professors in safe tenured jobs declare their willingness to save the world’s poor rather than America ’s poor.  Ayn Rand sycophants shrug at complaints – let them starve.   Everybody wants to do something about the warming planet and melting ice caps, but nobody wants to talk about a population explosion that has caused it.  Less educated and less wealthy Americans compete with an unending stream of immigrant and outsourcing labor competition, while our elites nimbly move their capital around the world and acquire ever-more-sophisticated skills in short supply</p>
<p>My opinion is that there is a complete, non-political split between the educated elites in America, and the rest.  I can beam instructions to my broker via satellite from rural Tennessee and make money to supplement my small pension.  My neighbor is 60 and looking for a job that will cover health care costs, in competition with increasing numbers of young Americans and immigrants.  It’s ironic – his job moved to Mexico, and he now competes with Mexicans in America for jobs.  Joe told me he thought nobody game a damn, and I told him about 70% of Americans did, but they were not in charge.  Where here does the anger come from? </p>
<p>It’s from a sense of betrayal.  In a very crowded country, more immigrants are waived across the border like in a NASCAR finish.  A historical sense of being “one country” has broken down, and those who were willing to be workers and led by the elites of American society are rebelling.  The 70% majority of Americans have no one to turn to for help, or at least that is the feeling.  As “rdan” points out no measure taken so far come close to helping those who are losing out.  America is very good, in the final analysis, at spreading the costs of a society but very poor at spreading the benefits.   How do we get that dynamic spirit of immigrants with a sparkle in their eye, and at the same time lift the spirits and the fortunes of ordinary Americans?  Just saying it’s happening is delusional.  Either trust will be restored by the elites, who control the power and the money in this country, or it won’t. </p>
<p>IMHO, an historic blunder has been made both by those who lead and those who follow.  (a)  Leaders, especially political Democratic leadership, risk a complete rupture with its historical supporters in a risky gamble that new immigrants will swell their voter ranks (and, even a more risky bet, that they’ll vote Democratic.)  Republican leaders, who cynically collared fundamentalist religious voters successfully since 2000, are more closely in touch with poorer economic classes, and now shout about the immigration flood that they themselves have sponsored so successfully.  (b)  Those that follow – the 70% of Americans who just put one foot in front of another – have made the blunder of ignoring their educations, their work ethic, and above all their political system.  Some 46% of eligible Americans did not vote in 2004, and some 48% couldn’t be bothered in 2000.  Yet Americans feel they’ve been turned into organ grinders’ monkeys, and they’re passionate about that betrayal.  Disagree?</p>

<blockquote><p>With Congress and the White House engaged in a long-running feud over war funds, President George W. Bush criticized Democrats on Saturday for holding up money he requested for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. </p>
<p>Bush is seeking $196 billion for the wars for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Democrats who control Congress want to attach a troop pullout plan to the funding bill for the war but lack enough votes to pass the measure in the Senate. </p>
<p>The White House has warned that Bush would veto any bill with such conditions. </p>
<p>In his weekly radio address, Bush said Congress was &#8220;failing to meet its responsibilities to our troops.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;For months, Congress has delayed action on supplemental war funding because some in Congress want to make a political statement about the war,&#8221; he said, criticizing Democrats for leaving for their Thanksgiving break without approving the war funds. </p>
<p>A bill passed this week by the House of Representatives would have given Bush about a quarter of the $196 billion he wants for the wars while setting a goal that all U.S. combat soldiers withdraw from Iraq by Dec. 15, 2008. </p>
<p>Republicans stopped the measure in the Senate. </p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would not bring another Iraq war funding bill to the House floor this year. </p>
<p>Defense Secretary Robert Gates has warned that without a cash infusion, he would soon make plans to lay off civilian employees, terminate contracts and cut base operations. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>ILSM continues:</p>
<p>Just a couple of ideas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bush said Congress was &#8220;failing to meet its responsibilities to our troops.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here Bush is saying: Let me waste the troops some more, but allow me to make it seem as if I care more for them than you do. If Bush cared for them he would have a political agenda in Iraq to establish a government that can take over. He does not and will not do anything aside from assuring they are there for the ever profitable long term. </p>
<p>This debate is about long pointless war, not who is meeting their responsibility for the best use of the &#8220;troops&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then Bush insists that congress following the will of the people is micromanaging the commanders, a switch and ploy since he is the commander being micromanaged. The commanders in the field only do what the commander in chief tells them to do.</p>
<p>As to whether he or congress know better the past six years show Bush needs micromanaging.</p>
<p>Second issue: </p>
<p>Gates comes in and threatens the longevity of the war as a jobs program, which is its sole purpose for most of its supporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Defense Secretary Robert Gates has warned that without a cash infusion, he would soon make plans to lay off civilian employees, terminate contracts and cut base operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reader 2slugbaits can help here being closer, but I do not think civil service jobs are dependent on supplementals, if they were they would be temporary appointments, which are just that. The temporary work ends at the end of conflict when the US is supposed to &#8220;demobilize&#8221;, a frightening term not seen much since 1947.</p>
<p>Gates is adding economic fear to the false fears Bush uses to extend the long war.</p>
<p>It is about time the congress does what we sent them there to do. Let the debate continue&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>My timetable would be 15 Dec 2007.</p>

Let’s start with an piece by <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2007/11/17/2007-11-17_rudy_giuliani_200_reasons_why_i_would_be.html">Richard Sisk</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Former Solicitor General Ted Olson, who introduced Giuliani, may have provided the gaffe of the day. Just a week after the indictment of former Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, Olson said Giuliani had shown &#8220;the wisdom and humility to surround himself with talented, dedicated and energetic people&#8221; as mayor.</p></blockquote>
<p>A gaffe to Richard is “a funny” to <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/059156.php">Steve Benen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of all the ways to introduce Rudy Giuliani, this has to be the least sensible &#8230; Seriously? Giuliani&#8217;s strength is his choice in associates? Let&#8217;s put that to the test:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Attacks against British and Iraqi forces have plunged by 90 percent in southern Iraq since London withdrew its troops from the main city of Basra, the commander of British forces there said Thursday.</p>
<p>The presence of British forces in downtown Basra, Iraq&#8217;s second-largest city, was the single largest instigator of violence, Maj. Gen. Graham Binns told reporters Thursday on a visit to Baghdad&#8217;s Green Zone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought, &#8216;If 90 percent of the violence is directed at us, what would happen if we stepped back?'&#8221; Binns said.</p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s 5,000 troops moved out of a former Saddam Hussein palace at Basra&#8217;s heart in early September, setting up a garrison at an airport on the city&#8217;s edge. Since that pullback, there&#8217;s been a &#8220;remarkable and dramatic drop in attacks,&#8221; Binns said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what percentage of violence against civilians has disappeared, take a look at Binns&#8217; question again.</p>
<p>If there is more of a reduction in violence where the opposite of the Surge has happened than where the Surge has taken place, what does that say about the effectiveness of the Surge?</p>
<p>And if its not the Surge, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/11/success-in-iraq.html">what has caused the drop in violence</a>?</p>

                                <p>I want to revisit the moment when it became the policy of this administration to lie to the American public about fiscal responsibility.  And I want to revisit the point where I decided  that Mitch Daniels and Glenn Hubbard were hacks. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the start of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/08/20010825.html">President&#8217;s radio address on August 25, 2001</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Good morning.  Congress will shortly return to Washington to make its final spending decisions for 2002.  A new budget report, released this past week, shows that despite the economic slowdown that began in the third quarter of last year, the federal budget is strong, healthy and in balance.  In fact, the 2002 budget surplus will be the second biggest surplus in American history.</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the week, then OMB director <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/08/20010822-1.html">Mitch Daniels had said</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In 2002, we forecast a growing, a larger surplus, $173 billion.  I think it&#8217;s very noteworthy that in 2002, we will pass an important landmark &#8212; interest costs &#8212; the debt burden on the federal Treasury will drop below a dime on the dollar down to 9 cents of each dollar of federal revenue.  That&#8217;s the lowest interest burden in a quarter century since 1976, and it&#8217;s headed down very quickly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds good, right?  Of course, that&#8217;s not what happened&#8230;  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/hist.html">OMB Table 1.3</a> tells us that for FY 2002, there was a deficit of 157 billion.</p>
<p>Put another way&#8230; the financial situation was $173 &#8211; (-$157) = $330 billion worse than predicted.</p>
<p>Why the difference?  Wellllll&#8230; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/taxreform/">a few months later</a> we were told:</p>
<blockquote><p>The War and Recession &#8212; Not the Tax Cuts &#8212; Drained the Budget Surplus<br /># While some in Washington want to blame the tax cut for the declining surplus, the facts tell a different story:</p>
<blockquote><p>    * The Recession Erased Two-Thirds of the Surplus: The recession and declining tax revenues drained roughly two-thirds of the budget surplus.<br />    * Homeland Security and War Spending Used 19% of the Surplus: Immediately following the terrorist attacks, President Bush and Congress rightly passed significant spending increases for the war against terrorism, homeland security, airline security, and emergency response. This necessary spending accounted for approximately 19% of the surplus.<br />    * The Tax Cut Only Used 15% of the Surplus: Despite the claims of some in Washington, the tax cut used less than 15% of the surplus.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh?  In August 2001, with the recession more than half done, the Bush tells us that there&#8217;s going to be the second largest surplus in history.  A year later, we&#8217;re informed that the recession drained 2/3 of the surplus away?  What happened&#8230; the last stretch of recession was the tough part? </p>
<p>But let&#8217;s do some math, shall we?  When the administration tells us that 2/3 of the lost surplus was due to the recession, what they&#8217;re telling us is that 2/3 of $330 billion, or $220 billion in reduced income was due to the 2 months of recession in FY 2002.</p>
<p>That year, according to OMB table 1.3, the gubmint collected 17.9% of GDP in taxes.  I think its reasonable to assume they were surprised it was this low &#8211; so let&#8217;s say they figured on 20%, which is higher than they had any right to expect.   That means&#8230; if taxes were $220 billion lower due to a recession, GDP was about 1.1 trillion lower than it would otherwise be.  (If they assumed receipts were  equal to 17.9% of GDP, that would mean the recession knocked off 1.235 trillion.) </p>
<p>The administration was basically saying that two months worth of recession removed over a trillion bucks from the GDP!!  To understand the magnitude of that statement, consider that according to  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/hist.html">OMB Table 1.2</a>, GDP at the end of FY 2002 was 10.377 trillion. </p>
<p>Which means that at the end of FY 2002, barring the two months of recession, GDP would have been equal to $1.1 trillion plus $10.377 trillion or about $11.477 trillion.  That in turn means the (nominal) growth in GDP from the end of FY 2001 (GDP = 10.058 trillion) to the end of FY 2002 would have been&#8230;  (11.477 &#8211; 10.058)/10.058, or about 14.1%.  14.1% growth???  14.1% growth???  14.1%!!!!!</p>
<p>Note&#8230; presumably, some percentage of the homeland security and war spending was less efficient than the spending that would otherwise have taken place &#8211; which means without that, growth would probably have been even higher than 14.1%&#8230; but I&#8217;ll ignore this line of inquiry.  </p>
<p>Now, let us briefly flitter around reality for a moment, and let me note &#8211; while the 14.1% is a nominal figure, you have to go back to the Truman administration &#8211;  more than 50 years, to find a single year nominal growth rate over 14%.  Even during the high inflation period of the 1970s and early 1980s it didn&#8217;t happen.   But basically&#8230;  since GW and the boys weren&#8217;t  forecasting inflation, presumably this 14% would come primarily from, well, real growth.  Maybe what, 10% real growth rate?  11%? What sort of real growth did they have to be expecting in order to see 14.1% nominal?  How does a sane person with a working knowledge of economics assume such a growth rate?</p>
<p>Before we talk about what this assumption means, I want to talk about the cast of characters involved in this forecast.  GW himself&#8230; well, I honestly don&#8217;t think the coke and the drink left him with as many dendrites as God gave the average toaster in the last year that growth was above 14% a year, but we were constantly assured that he had good advisers &#8211; the grownups were in charge, we were told.  So who were these advisers? Who were these grownups?  Well, one obvious one was Mitch Daniels &#8211; then head of the OMB, now governor of Indiana (and up for re-election in 2008).  Another was the chair of GW&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisers at the time, Glenn Hubbard.  He&#8217;s now dean of the Columbia Business School, an economic advisor to Mitt Romney, and I believe he&#8217;s on some sort of a Fed appointed committee to look into the effects of globalization. Then there was Paul O&#8217;Neill, who was Treasury Secretary at the time.  I&#8217;m sure there were others at the top tier who could claim at least partial credit.  </p>
<p>So back to the assumption &#8211; a nominal growth rate in excess of 14%, and a real growth rate of somewhere around or above 10% in FY 2002 had there been no recession.  Now, its possible I made a mistake somewhere here&#8230; I&#8217;ve been pretty clear with my steps though&#8230; if there&#8217;s a mistake, I have little doubt someone will catch it.  So under the assumption that I haven&#8217;t made a mistake, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s left in terms of options, as I see it:</p>
<blockquote><p>1.  These guys weren&#8217;t able or willing to do the simple arithmetic shown above.   From what I can tell, none of the steps shown above is outside the capability of an average 7th grader or a somewhat slow senior in high school with access to a pencil. <br />2.  These guys understood that the administration&#8217;s collective position was that growth would have been 14% barring a recession, which in turn implies that:<br />a.  They believed it or<br />b.  They were willing to let it be said to the American public anyway</p></blockquote>
<p>If there&#8217;s another option, I simply don&#8217;t see it.  And I&#8217;m not sure which option is most damning.  To me, the first speaks to incompetence on a breath-taking level for folks who are supposed to advise the President on running the economy.  Where I sit, the second implies not just incompetence, but an almost incredible level of delusion.   I think the third option might be excusable in the old USSR where speaking out could have gotten the entire family of the person speaking out in trouble.  It might even work as an excuse for most Americans who are struggling to survive financially, but its hard to imagine that if Glenn Hubbard had gotten himself fired for speaking up he&#8217;d have been struggling to pay the bills.  </p>
<p>That said, I would be surprised if any of so-called grownups are worse off financially now than they were then.  There really are no negative consequences for their behavior&#8230; at least not for them.  For the rest of us, perhaps, but not for them.  And as long as that continues to be true, there will be another Mitch Daniels and another Glenn Hubbard.  Many of them, in fact.</p>
<p>Update&#8230;.</p>
<p>Reader CoRev notes that perhaps when the administration mentions the disappearing surplus, they meant the surplus from 2001.  Never mind the surplus they forecasted.  OK, fine.  My response to him (cut out from comments):</p>
<blockquote><p>The surplus in 2001 was&#8230;128 billion. That mens the turnaround was 285.8 billion. 2/3 of that is 190.5 billion. I&#8217;ll round down to 190 billion.</p>
<p>Assuming they were expecting 20% of GDP to be collected in taxes, that means they were assuming an extra $953 billion in GDP, or that they were expecting a GDP of 11.33 trillion for FY 2002.</p>
<p>Since the GDP in FY 2002 was 10.058 trillion, that means they were expecting a growth rate of 12.7% in FY 2002. (Again, note that I&#8217;ve gone with an unrealistically high tax collection assumption to make it look better.)</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s a heck of a lot more realistic. Of course they should have managed to achieve a 12.7% growth rate without a those two months of recession! I&#8217;m reassured now.</p></blockquote>
