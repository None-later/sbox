                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Ex-GF loves to play poker.  That, and the stuff Starbucks calls coffee, are her two big addictions.  Now, I&#8217;m not willing to take up coffee drinking, but I figured it helps if married couples share a few interests, so I started learning how to play poker.  I&#8217;ve probably played ten or twelve times in my life, all but two or three in the last six months.  And lately I&#8217;ve been lucky&#8230; last night I played a small (50 person) tournament and won it, taking home over $800.  And I&#8217;ve actually been making (small amounts) of money playing (I keep track &#8211; as a consultant you learn to think about hourly rates) in the last two or three months, even leaving out last night.  The Ex-GF thinks I&#8217;m a natural.  I think I&#8217;ve been very lucky, and that so far I&#8217;ve been able to read people better than they can read me&#8230;  which can change very quickly.</p>
<p>Which leads to a few thoughts:</p>
<p>1.  It took twelve hours to make $800.  And a lot of luck was necessary.  There was at least one hand in which I was all-in that I should not have won&#8230; once the cards were on the table, it was clear my odds were under 20%.  I also lost two big hands for which my odds of winning were very high.  <br />2.  I&#8217;ve noticed that as often as not, the best players in this poker league the Ex-GF plays in don&#8217;t make the final table.  Luck makes one heck of a difference.  Presumably this is true of the professional poker players.  How much is luck and how much is skill for people who know what they are doing?  How can you tell?<br />3.  Is it a good thing for the Ex-GF and I if I turn out to be a better player than she is?<br />4.  I have been playing up the bumbling fool persona (its even more on the spot in real life than it is with my on-line posts) &#8211; my feeling is that its better to be under-estimated than over-estimated.  But is that true of poker?  I&#8217;ve noticed people are more likely to fold to those players everyone knows are good.<br />5.  As per item 4&#8230;  while I was trying to sell my Inspector Clouseau routine to everyone, the Ex-GF was going around telling people about her husband, the &#8220;Ph.D. economist who makes a living crunching numbers.&#8221;  Did that help my cause or or hurt it?<br />6.  As a Ph.D. economist who makes a living crunching numbers and who has been very lucky as of late, my own opinion at this time is you don&#8217;t play the odds, you play the other players.  You have to have some idea of what the odds are, but if you play the odds you will be abused by people who play you.  <br />7.  Mistakes come from being emotional.  But if the price of not making mistakes is not feeling emotions (this does give me an advantage &#8211; I am extremely even-keeled in real life, and besides, poker is the Ex-GF&#8217;s thing, not mine) then is poker really a hobby for those who play it?<br />8.  My wife&#8217;s poker buddies are pretty cool people, on average.  I was expecting, well, a bunch of drunkards or something.  Instead, its an eclectic crowd, ranging from young barely twenty-something hip kids to some fifty something corporate types and hippies.  A surprising number of them, even for LA, have a connection to the film and tv industry.<br />9.  Women seem to make up anywhere from 20% to 40% of the attendees at each of these tournaments.  But there&#8217;s rarely more than one woman at the final table&#8230; and the last few players seem to always be male.  My theory&#8230;  women have a harder time disassociating the social aspect of game from the, well, winning aspect of the game.  That&#8217;s not to say that all men can do it&#8230; but the guys that I&#8217;ve noticed seem to be the best players in the group all can.  In fact, I told the Ex-GF that if she wants to be a better player, she&#8217;s going to have to stop playing like a girl.  Am I right about this?</p>
<p>Finally, I have a suspicion I&#8217;m going to have to play poker every so often (once every two or three weeks) for a long time.  Any suggestions to being a better player?  Or any comments about poker?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrill/%3C/a">John Robb</a> offers a viewpoint on progress in Iraq and lessons to be learned.</p>
<blockquote><p>When the <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2006/02/al_qaedas_black.html">Askariya shrine</a> was bombed in February 2006, it fractured Iraqi social systems along religious lines. In the fighting that followed, Sunni guerrilla groups underwent a transformation from small and loosely connected to large and bureaucratic. This change was driven by three factors:<br />Shiite militias, operating without much government interference, were able to field large military formations in their attacks on Sunni targets.<br />Sunni neighborhoods needed a permanent militia to defend them against attacks.<br />US forces were relatively ineffective against Sunni guerrillas up until that point and offered no meaningful counter. The guerrillas were flush with cash and confident the US posed little threat. The combination of organic group growth and formal cross group affiliation led to the formation of the bureaucratic structures necessary to maintain groups larger than 150 people (read: &#8220;<a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2004/03/what_is_the_opt.html">The Optimal Size of a Terrorist Network</a>&#8221; for more). Here&#8217;s an example from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/19/AR2007111902022.html?nav=rss_print/asection">Amit Paley&#8217;s</a> WP interview with a recently captured &#8220;al Qaeda&#8221; insurgent in Mosul:<br />The 28-year-old said he was responsible for running the bureaucracy and arranging payments to the 500 or so fighters for the group in the city, who he said try to carry out as many as 30 attacks a day. This expansion in group size led to a radical increase in violence against almost every potential target. It also changed the underlying dynamic of the insurgency. The process of increasing group size and a movement towards local protection forced the following:<br />As groups formally affiliated to form larger organizations, a schism developed between homegrown guerrillas and those operating under &#8220;al Qaeda&#8217;s&#8221; banner.<br />Tighter ties to local communities for protection against Shiite militias led to jihadi control over neighborhoods. This in turn led to jihadi overreach and a local counter-reaction.<br />The increase in group size finally made al Qaeda accessible to US counter-pressure. It now had a center of gravity to attack. This is yet another level of complication that should muddy the &#8220;lesson&#8221; of &#8220;the Anbar tribal revolt.&#8221; The US should military think long and hard before it squanders tens of millions (soon hundreds of millions) of dollars on Pakistan&#8217;s Frontier Corps.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sort of discussion goes on other blogs familiar with the topic. Levels of complication as we talk about success or failure is a useful approach, while political memes of &#8216;less violence&#8217; is not.</p>

It is worth thinking about. Current opinions on the justification for waterboarding are secret, and legal arguments in its favor less than convincing.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The DOJ trial attorneys handling the real-life prosecution of Chuckie Taylor Jr. are, on the other hand, not confused in the least about the law of torture. Here is what they&#8217;ve had to say:<br />First, a defendant doesn&#8217;t get to walk merely because the indictment charges acts &#8211; such as pouring hot water over a victim&#8217;s body and administering electric shocks to his genitalia &#8211; that are not specifically prohibited by the statute.<br />This argument &#8211; that a person cannot know whether his conduct falls within the definition of torture unless it is expressly proscribed by Section 2340 &#8211; is precisely the one we&#8217;ve heard from Michael Mukasey with regard to waterboarding. Unfortunately for the new attorney general, however, his subordinates on the front lines consider this contention barely worthy of discussion.<br />For starters &#8211; and here I must interject because the prosecutors obviously found this point too basic to mention in a court filing &#8211; almost no criminal statute purports to exhaustively list all the means by which it could be violated. First degree murder, for example, is usually defined as &#8220;an unlawful killing with malice aforethought.&#8221; No laws that I&#8217;m aware of specifically proscribe, say, killing your spouse by injecting his pumpkin pie with deadly bacteria in order to cause fatal septicemia &#8211; not something my actual spouse needs to worry about, by the way &#8211; but ordinary people contemplating this course of action would know that it could well constitute first degree murder, and really ruin a good Thanksgiving dinner.<br />The operative word here is ordinary &#8211; which is precisely what the Justice Department attorneys stressed in their response to Taylor Jr.&#8217;s motion. The test of whether a statute provides adequate notice to a prospective defendant, they pointed out, is the same in every criminal case. As the Supreme Court held years ago, the issue is simply whether &#8220;reasonable&#8221; or &#8220;ordinary&#8221; persons could consider their conduct in light of the language of the statute and know that they were at risk for prosecution.<br />Can ordinary people evaluate whether certain acts or courses of action could reasonably be considered as &#8220;specifically intended to cause severe physical or mental pain or suffering&#8221; such that they would fall within the prohibition of Section 2340 &#8211; even though those acts are not itemized or described in detail?<br /><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />Second, the Justice Department attorneys were equally dismissive of Taylor Jr.&#8217;s contention that the torture statute is overly vague because it does not separately define the term &#8220;severe&#8221; in the phrase &#8220;severe mental or physical pain or suffering.&#8221; This argument sounds awfully familiar as well, doesn&#8217;t it?<br />Unfortunately for the White House, this, too, is a common defense claim that the Supreme Court has addressed with a basic rule: When words are not defined in a statute, they &#8220;will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.&#8221; Nothing tricky here at all, the federal prosecutors argued in their reply to Taylor Jr.&#8217;s motion to dismiss. On the contrary, the criminal code is &#8220;replete&#8221; with instances of &#8220;statutory elements that call for juries to use common sense to evaluate terms such as severe pain, serious bodily injury, severe mental or physical pain.&#8221; The jury in the Taylor Jr. case would be equally capable of applying the common-sense meaning of &#8220;severe&#8221; to the facts of the case. The judge agreed.<br />Finally, what do Justice Department prosecutors and assistant US attorneys think of the notion &#8211; advanced by both defendant Taylor Jr. and the Bush administration &#8211; that the torture statute is so impossibly complex that it can only be interpreted by experts?<br />Not much. This is what they argued in their reply memo:<br />&#8220;Defendant is wrong to suggest that the torture statute presents novel questions for which courts and juries are ill-equipped.&#8221;<br />The DOJ lawyers prosecuting Chuckie Taylor on charges of committing and conspiring to commit torture are, of course, correct &#8211; on all of the above. And Attorney General Michael Mukasey already knows it.<br /><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Bush administration officials could claim they relied on legal opinions written by DOJ appointee Steven Bradbury. But in criminal law, the defense of reliance on advice of counsel requires good faith, proof of which would be an uphill battle when those legal opinions were kept secret because they purported to sanction conduct which has been universally condemned for centuries.</p>

<p>The 1% rule of Dick Cheney&#8217;s making does not work in the rule of law, and to actually institutionalize a waterboarding policy into bureaucracy is very dangerous to us all. And the rejoinder of other 1% threats or less when we do not invest in basic defense measures as defined in other posts makes the argument dishonest.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/01/pdf/poverty_report.pdf">Several economists</a> have prepared a report through American Progress about costs of poverty (not cost of programs to address the issue).</p>
<blockquote><p>Most arguments for reducing poverty in the U.S., especially among children, rest on a moral casefor doing so—one that emphasizes the unfairness of child poverty, and how it runs counter to ournational creed of equal opportunity for all.But there is also an economic case for reducing child poverty. When children grow up in poverty,they are somewhat more likely than non-poor children to have low earnings as adults, which in turnreflects lower workforce productivity. They are also somewhat more likely to engage in crime (thoughthat’s not the case for the vast majority) and to have poor health later in life. Their reduced productiveactivity generates a direct loss of goods and services to the U.S. economy.What’s more, any crime in which they engage imposes large monetary and other personal costs ontheir victims, as well as the costs to the taxpayer of administering our huge criminal justice system.And their poor health generates illness and early mortality which not only require large healthcareexpenditures, but also impede productivity and ultimately reduce their quality and quantity of life.In this paper, we review a range of rigorous research studies that estimate the average statistical relationshipsbetween children growing up in poverty and their earnings, propensity to commit crime,and quality of health later in life. We also review estimates of the costs that crime and poor healthper person impose on the economy. Then we aggregate all of these average costs per poor child acrossthe total number of children growing up in poverty in the U.S. to estimate the aggregate costs ofchild poverty to the U.S. economy.We had to make a number of critical assumptions about how to define and measure poverty, whatlevel of income to use as a non-poverty benchmark, and which effects are really caused by growingup in poverty and not simply correlated with it. Wherever possible, we made conservative assumptions,in order to generate lower-bound estimates.The upshot: Our results suggest that the costs to the U.S. associated with childhood poverty total about$500B per year, or the equivalent of nearly 4 percent of GDP.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A Republican scholar and former official who testified at the hearing, Ron Haskins, now a senior fellow at the <a title="More articles about Brookings Institution" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/b/brookings_institution/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Brookings Institution</a>, called the study superb and said that while economists might quibble over details, the $500 billion cost estimate costs “might be in the ballpark.”<br />Mr. Haskins noted that the authors had not specified the high cost of eliminating child poverty, which census figures show affected 12.3 million children in 2005, or 17.1 percent of those younger than 18.<br />“Do not think that if we suddenly gave a bunch of money to poor people, everything would change,” he told lawmakers, adding that behaviors, neighborhoods and parents’ actions need to change if children’s life paths are to change.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is another way to look at costs to us of doing nothing to address the issue.</p>

<blockquote><p>Democrats like to define themselves as the party of poor and middle-income Americans, but a new study says they now represent the majority of the nation&#8217;s wealthiest congressional districts … But in a broader measurement, the study also showed that of the 167 House districts where the median annual income was higher than the national median of $48,201, a slight majority, 84 districts, were represented by Democrats.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow!  Of the 435 districts in the U.S., 167 had median incomes that were greater than the national median.  And just over half of those were represented by the Democrats!  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives2/2007/11/019088.php">John Hindraker</a> strives to find an explanation of this observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, these numbers are skewed somewhat by the fact that Democrats tend to represent urban districts where average incomes are higher. But there is no disputing the trend: prosperous Congressional districts are increasingly turning blue, across the country.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/horsesmouth/2007/11/silly_new_wingn.php">Greg Sargent</a> is mocking these two noting: (1) being above the national median isn’t exactly rich; and (2) the difference in the total districts that sent a Democrat to Congress and the difference in the districts with median income above the national median likely is not even statistically significant.  The author this ho-hum study just happened to be Michael Franc of the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed110607a.cfm">Heritage Foundation</a>.  Franc tries to claim that the Democrats will come to represent the interests of the wealthy rather than the rest of us.  Yea, right!</p>

<blockquote><p>The skill, industry and productivity of American workers are the driving force of our free economy. The Nation&#8217;s labor unions, comprised of millions of working people, have advanced the well-being not only of their members but also of our entire free-enterprise system. We of the Republican Party reaffirm our strong endorsement of Organized Labor&#8217;s key role in our national life.</p>
<p>We salute the statesmanship of the labor union movement. Time and time again, at crucial moments, it has voiced its outspoken support for a firm and effective foreign policy and for keeping the Armed Forces of the United States modern and strong.</p>
<p>The American labor movement and the Republican Party have always worked against the spread of totalitarian forms of government. Together we can continue to preserve in America the best system of government ever devised for human happiness and fulfillment.</p>
<p>We are for the right of American workers and their families to enjoy and to retain to the greatest possible extent the rewards of their own labor.</p>
<p>We regard collective bargaining as the cornerstone of the Nation&#8217;s labor relations policy. The government&#8217;s role is not to encroach upon this process but rather to aid the differing parties to make collective bargaining more effective both for themselves and for the public. In furtherance of that concept, we will continue to develop procedures whereby the imagination, ingenuity and knowledge of labor and management can more effectively seek solutions for such problems as structural adjustment and productivity. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>To provide the same learning opportunities enjoyed by other American children, we have increased bilingual education programs almost six-fold since 1969.

<p>We will work for the use of bilingual staffs in localities where this language capability is desirable for effective health care. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>GW&#8217;s supporters like to say that, when looked at from &#8220;the same point in the business cycle&#8221; the growth rate under GW stacks up favorably relative to the growth rate under Clinton.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/11/at-same-point-in-business-cycle.html">Its not true</a>.  And as my fellow Angry Bear PGL noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/11/only-idiots-talk-about-same-point-in.html">its also not true for employment</a>.</p>
<p>This post takes a slightly different approach.  I&#8217;ve noted several times that GW&#8217;s poor performance comes despite massive help from the Fed.  How massive?  Let&#8217;s look at the percentage change in the real Money Supply since the end of the last recession.  </p>
<p>Monthly data (through October 2007) data on non-seasonally adjusted M2 can be found at <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/hist/h6hist1.txt">the Fed&#8217;s site</a>.  (That&#8217;s the broadest measure of money for which the Fed still produces data.)  Using monthly <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI-U</a> data, we can adjust for inflation.  </p>
<p>The table below looks at the percentage change in (non-seasonally adjusted) M2 since the end of the last recession.  (Note&#8230; since Nov 2007 data is not available yet, I used October 2007 data.)</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R0cVFbYBdLI/AAAAAAAAA4Q/2V0sVkEeJiw/s1600-h/real+M2+since+end+of+last+recession.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R0cVFbYBdLI/AAAAAAAAA4Q/2V0sVkEeJiw/s320/real+M2+since+end+of+last+recession.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Notice&#8230; six years after the end of the first recession, real M2 is still below where it was during the recession.  Anyone remember that being what the Fed should do to promote recovery?  That&#8217;s not what any of the textbooks I ever saw said.  In fact, it seems to be the opposite of what monetary policy looks when the Fed is trying to get the economy on its feet again.  Its almost like Uncle Alan was doing his best to screw things up, isn&#8217;t it?  And before you say &#8220;irrational exuberance&#8221; &#8211; in 1992?  1993?  1994?  In fact, the series bottoms out in 1995&#8230; if there was a time that cutting back on the real money lever might have made sense, its at least a year or two beyond that point.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the pattern after the 2001 recession.  GW got all the help a President could reasonable expect, and perhaps more.  And still, here we are.  Plus, the bill for some of that &#8220;perhaps more&#8221; looks about ready to come due.</p>

                                <p>In an op ed in the Financial Times, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dda3edc6-9786-11dc-9e08-0000779fd2ac.html">Grover Norquist</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The US was founded as a constitutional republic. There were to be no kings, dukes or other rapscallions in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Thomas Paine spoke for all of us in Common Sense, saying there was no role for hereditary monarchy in the new world: “For all men being originally equals, no one by birth could have a right to set up his own family in perpetual preference to all others for ever, and though himself might deserve some decent degree of honours of his contemporaries, yet his descendants might be far too unworthy to inherit them.”</p>
<p>America’s national constitution, written by representatives of 13 jealous states, even gives the federal government the task of guaranteeing a “republican form of government” in the states and adds: “No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States.” The queen of Hawaii had to go.</p>
<p>It could not be much clearer. No aristocracy. No king. No inherited titles.</p>
<p>Yet while Americans complain about Hosni Mubarak’s plan to replace himself as president of Egypt with Mubarak Junior, roll their eyes at Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, the son of the late President Hafez al-Assad, and giggle at North Korea’s Kim to Kim dynastic communism, we are about to hold a presidential election that may extend a sequence that gives the land of the free four years of George H.W. Bush, eight years of William Clinton, eight years of George W. Bush, son of, and the start of eight years of Hillary Clinton, wife of.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone remember whether Grover was saying this eight years ago, or is this anti-aristocracy thing new to him?</p>
<p>He goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>This creeping tendency to see elected office as a family heirloom is not just present in the executive. Congress is littered with the spouses and sons and daughters of former congressmen who wanted to keep the position in the family.</p></blockquote>
<p>So now he wants a constitutional amendment that reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Section 1. No spouse, sibling or child of an elected or appointed federal, state or local official outside the civil service may immediately succeed that official in the same elected or appointed office.</p>
<p>Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation, including exempting certain elected or appointed offices from its general proscription and defining the term “immediately succeed” to prevent circumventions.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then he ends with this&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>This can bring all Americans together to remind ourselves of the importance of being a republic and the dangers of anyone’s aristocratic pre­tensions, and to suggest to Chelsea Clinton and Laura Bush that they look for other lines of work in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gee&#8230;  I wonder what effect eliminating the inheritance tax is going to have on the  &#8220;aristocratic pretensions&#8221; of the children of the wealthy.</p>

<p>A first alert story by <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j733M6iHxh7lJ5HbV4ELJMgItSEA">Agence France-Presse</a> detailed a horrible story of how the rule of law works in Saudi Arabia .  The American press, except for Jack McCafferty on CNN, remains largely silent.  The US State Department calls the report “astonishing” and moves on at its press briefing.</p>
<p> The followup story by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7106234.stm">the BBC</a> reports some public comments by American politicians, none of whom are in a position to do anything about the outrage.  It also reports that the Saudi Ministry of the Interior has supported the verdict of 200 lashes and six months in prison for a 19 year old Shia rape victim by seven Sunni men, and also warned the public about “agitation through the media.”  </p>

<p>What could account for the strange silence by our leadership?  Perhaps it’s the years of business and personal friendships formed between the Bush family and the Saud family, decades of intertwined dealings.  Perhaps it’s something more immediate, and temporary.  For example a last ditch fling at peacemaking in the Middle East as suggested in <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12417840">this story</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>August 1, 2007 · Saudi leaders said they would seriously consider attending a Mideast peace conference later this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>This pow-wow seems a paltry reason for any of the following:  (a) friendship with the Saudi family regime, (b) failure to comment on the lack of democracy in Saudi Arabia, (c) abandonment of human rights as an American policy, or (d) support of theocracies and their brutal ways. </p>
<p>The Quixotic and demented effort by Americans to settle the grievances in the Middle East never had less chance than under the current US administration, IMHO.  Why?  How about – American armies invading the Muslim world?  And is it truly in our national interest to be “united rather than divided” from the ruling “royals” of Saudi Arabia?  How would they have treated Princess Diana, to draw an obvious parallel?</p>

<p>No, I don’t really think we are going to have to beg entrance to the Thunderdome with Mad Max.  There may, or may not, be a dramatic moment in economic history arriving in the next year.  Super-charged with cheap Japanese “carry trade” funds that have been used for all kinds of global financial investments, and under the influence of dynamic growth of emerging market economies, the US economy and investment markets have held their own in recent years.  This has perplexed many of us who are more pessimistic observers.  How can you argue with apparent success?  Yet now the US “real” economy is turning down along with credit markets and financial markets.<br />We may not have a clear path ahead according to <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/afd6e830-978b-11dc-9e08-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1">Martin Wolf</a> at the Financial Times.    Instead Mr. Wolf foresees, as do many other commentators and analysts, a period of years in which the US economy grows at a slower pace.  The pressures for this will be the financial unwinding of the house price bubble and the credit markets returning to some version of sanity.  He suggests there are two ways this “great unwinding” can go:</p>
<p>   1. Non-US economies can increase investment and consumption, to meet the increased ability of emerging market economies to supply the world, or<br />   2. Non-US economies, especially emerging market economies, will decrease supply to meet falling demand from the US.</p>
<p>His thesis is that the first option is better than the second. “Pick up the slack, or slow down the world merry-go-round,” so to speak.</p>
<p>Here are some worthwhile points to think about (and discuss):</p>
<p>   1. Of those US policy options and programs which we discuss every day, which will be affected most by a slowdown of the US economy?<br />   2. Will the governments of the emerging economies move their policies more toward domestic investment and consumption, or maintain their foreign currency reserves and allow exports to fall?<br />   3. What will happen to relative currency rates in the short-, medium-, and longer terms?<br />   4. What are the bright spots in the world’s economic landscape, if Mr. Wolf’s prognosis is correct?</p>
