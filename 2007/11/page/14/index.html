<blockquote><p>&#8230;In fact, waterboarding is just the type of torture then Lt. Commander John McCain had to endure at the hands of the North Vietnamese. As a former<strong> Master Instructor and Chief of Training at the US Navy Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape School (SERE) in San Diego, California I know the waterboard personally and intimately. SERE staff were required undergo the waterboard at its fullest. I was no exception. I have personally led, witnessed and supervised waterboarding of hundreds of people. </strong>It has been reported that both the Army and Navy SERE school’s interrogation manuals were used to form the interrogation techniques used by the US army and the CIA for its terror suspects. What was not mentioned in most articles was that SERE was designed to show how an evil totalitarian, enemy would use torture at the slightest whim. If this is the case, then waterboarding is unquestionably being used as torture technique.</p>
<p>The carnival-like he-said, she-said of the legality of Enhanced Interrogation Techniques has become a form of doublespeak worthy of Catch-22. Having been subjected to them all, I know these techniques, if in fact they are actually being used, are not dangerous when applied in training for short periods. However, when performed with even moderate intensity over an extended time on an unsuspecting prisoner – it is torture, without doubt. Couple that with waterboarding and the entire medley not only “shock the conscience” as the statute forbids -it would terrify you. Most people can not stand to watch a high intensity kinetic interrogation. One has to overcome basic human decency to endure watching or causing the effects. The brutality would force you into a personal moral dilemma between humanity and hatred. It would leave you to question the meaning of what it is to be an American.</p>
<p>We live at a time where Americans, completely uninformed by an incurious media and enthralled by vengeance-based fantasy television shows like “24”, are actually cheering and encouraging such torture as justifiable revenge for the September 11 attacks. Having been a rescuer in one of those incidents and personally affected by both attacks, I am bewildered at how casually we have thrown off the mantle of world-leader in justice and honor.

<p>I suggest you check his profile as well. And get ready for swiftboating during the hearing and after tomorrow if he follows through with his testimony. It is about time the MSM did some research&#8230;.oops, not on MSM, just stenotyping politicos. Either for or against.</p>

                                <p>I check out Robert Reich&#8217;s blog on occasion being that he is a person who was involved in the past.  <a href="http://robertreich.blogspot.com/">Yesterdays:</a>
<div align="left">
<blockquote>
<div align="left">Over a decade ago when, as Secretary of Labor, I hollered about the scandal of widening inequality in America, I’d get phone calls from Democratic officials who politely asked me to shut up. After all, I was part of the administration, and my complaints made it seem as if the administration wasn’t doing nearly enough. It wasn’t. <strong>We hadn’t delivered on Bill Clinton’s 1992 election promises</strong>. An expanded Earned Income Tax Credit helped the poorest but the old working class was going nowhere.</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Well, what&#8217;d yah know? Clinton&#8217;s progressive first run rhetoric was fluff.</p>
<p>He says there are 2 thoughts in this country; trickle down and bottom up.</p>
<blockquote><p>In a global economy, investments don’t trickle down; they trickles out to wherever on the planet the rich can get the highest return. If trickle down worked as advertised inequality wouldn’t be widening so fast.</p>
<p>Bottom up means giving all Americans what they need to be productive – universal and affordable health coverage, good schools, a chance to attend college, job retraining, affordable child care, and good public transportation to and from the job, for starters. But as we learned a decade ago, this requires money – even more, now. So the question is how the nation can afford it&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solution:<br />
<blockquote>The only way is to stop obsessing about balancing the budget and start pushing for a serious tax hike on the rich. Yet all Democratic presidential candidates are styling themselves &#8220;fiscal conservatives&#8221; and none has suggested raising the marginal tax rate on the richest beyond the 38 percent rate it was under Bill Clinton. They may talk bottom-up economics but they&#8217;re still wedded to trickle down.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think someone is feeling betrayed. So, what are the candidates talking?<br />I give you an interview by Charlie Rose of <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2007/08/06/1/economic-advisors-of-three-leading-democratic-presidential-campaigns">3 economic advisors </a>to 3 democratic candidates.<br />And, just for good measure here is an interview with<a href="http://www.frugalmarketing.com/dtb/leo-hindery.shtml"> Leo Hindrey, Mr. Edwards </a>econ adviser.</p>
<p>A teaser from the interview:<br />
<blockquote>In 1981 the Business Roundtable noted that CEOs have multiple constituencies, but in 2004 &#8211; after Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia, the NYSE, etc. &#8211; that very same Business Roundtable narrowed CEO responsibility back to &#8220;shareholders only&#8221;. How wrong they are! Unless and until CEOs acknowledge obligations as well to employees, customers, communities and the nation, misbehaviours will continue &#8211; and, by the way, management is not a constituency unto itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>My favorite line from the interview (cause I&#8217;ve noted here, and implied here the same question although Walmart is just his example):<br />
<blockquote>The question Wal-Mart simply needs to ask itself is &#8220;when is enough, enough?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What was that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/money-from-money-not-good.html">Mr Bogle </a>was saying about enough?</p>

<blockquote><p>Veterans make up one in four homeless people in the United States, though they are only 11 percent of the general adult population, according to a report to be released Thursday.</p>
<p>And homelessness is not just a problem among middle-age and elderly veterans. Younger veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are trickling into shelters and soup kitchens seeking services, treatment or help with finding a job.</p>
<p>The Veterans Affairs Department has identified 1,500 homeless veterans from the current wars and says 400 of them have participated in its programs specifically targeting homelessness.</p>
<p>The National Alliance to End Homelessness, a public education nonprofit, based the findings of its report on numbers from Veterans Affairs and the Census Bureau. 2005 data estimated that 194,254 homeless people out of 744,313 on any given night were veterans.</p>
<p>In comparison, the VA says that 20 years ago, the estimated number of veterans who were homeless on any given night was 250,000.</p>
<p>Some advocates say the early presence of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan at shelters does not bode well for the future. It took roughly a decade for the lives of Vietnam veterans to unravel to the point that they started showing up among the homeless. Advocates worry that intense and repeated deployments leave newer veterans particularly vulnerable.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>In all of 2006, the National Alliance to End Homelessness estimates that 495,400 veterans were homeless at some point during the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>In any discussion about those without health insurance, someone on the right invariably tells us that many (most?) of those who are uninsured choose not to have insurance.  With homelessness, that tradition goes back farther&#8230; Reagan himself told us many of the homeless were &#8220;urban campers&#8221; who chose to be homeless.  No doubt that explains the over-representation of Vets who presumably have better survival skills than most.  To the rest of us, its another cost of the war, borne disproportionately by a few.</p>

<p>Just read <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2173459/nav/navoa/">The bad economics of switching health-care plans</a> from Slate&#8217;s Dismal Science section.</p>
<p>20-30 percent of policy-holders switch carriers every year.  This wreaks havoc on preventative care, both in terms of incentive to provide it and, more significantly, on successfully sustaining care for chronic conditions.  The turnover rate over time has probably gone up due to increased job turnover (the old adage that a worker nowadays will have x times as many jobs in their life as a typical worker did x years ago), but also (more problematic for economic theory?) as competition increases among health plans to attract customers (with modern benefit documents looking more complex than cellphone policies).</p>
<p>Half of all turnover comes from employer groups switching among insurers, not from employees switching jobs.</p>
<p>I worked for some time as a web developer for a small business health insurance brokerage, and the goal of their website was to provide an easy to look at grid of the difference among health care plans available.  Eventually the insurance carriers stepped in and prohibited us from putting them on such a grid, with some justification, as the simplification would unequally hurt more or less complicated plans.  But there was also an element of the economic advantage of obfuscation.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>I have over 10 years experience in each of two thankless and often maligned organizations:  the US Foreign Service and the IRS. </p>
<p>The first was a popular and sought after job despite stressful living conditions, frequent overseas transfers, divorce rates, and from time to time personal danger or disease.  Nevertheless, there were (in the 1970’s) and still are today about 100 applicants for every job opening every year.  It’s considered a job for the “best and the brightest” who have a strong belief in public service despite the slurs against “cookie pushers.”  Mr. Kissinger spoke at my class orientation before our first assignments, and said that diplomacy was defined best as the simple words of an honest man.  The Ambassador to Saudi Arabia in the early 1980’s told his staff that “Service in this country requires an extra measure of patriotism.”   It may have just been a more hopeful time, but we all believed him.</p>
<p>People seem to hate the IRS in a generalized way.  Sometimes I’ve heard first or secondhand stories of  tough treatment of individuals, “cruel” liens on property, the terrible “ordeal” of an audit, and the discouragement of investment and small business through excessive record keeping requirements.  Television ads by law firms offering to “save you” from the IRS are frequent.  Jobs with the IRS often go unfilled and are not considered “high quality” jobs for any but the most ambitious accountants, lawyers, or economists who hope to vault into high paying private jobs after a few years.  It’s an enforcement organization that, through the strangest philosophical twist by otherwise law-and-order politicians, has been re-styled publicly as a “customer service” organization.</p>
<p>Personally, looking back, my informed opinion of the people who work as career employees of both organizations is that they were and continue to be bright, dedicated, honest people.  The only difference was that the Foreign Service job was sometimes fun, while the IRS was ultimately more useful to the public.  The lawmakers who make foreign policy and tax laws and appoint the political management of these organizations never seem to take the same “hit” as career employees, strangely enough.  I’ve heard perfectly sincere people of all political persuasions declare that “We ought to abolish the IRS and start over.”</p>
<p>Questions: </p>
<p>(1) Do you think taxes will collect themselves?  Or will your Grandma have to hop up out of her nursing home wheelchair and chase down her own taxes to pay for her Social Security check and Medicare? </p>
<p>(2) Would you like to make taxes go away by making the IRS go away?  Can you kill the bearer of bad news and make the news better?</p>
<p>(3) Why, or why not, have public servants and not simply contract everything to mercenaries?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>This one was by reader OldVet.  To our readers that are Bush supporters, I would amend OldVet&#8217;s first question as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Do you think taxes will collect themselves?  Or will your Armed Forces have to hop up out of their Bradleys in Iraq and chase down their own taxes to pay for their Defense Budget and Supplementals?</p>

For those that think Social Security is wrong, so be it, but it is there and is promised.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Texans were already lining up to get help at the Social Security office in Pasadena, a suburb of Houston, at 8 a.m., an hour before the office opens. The glass-and-concrete building, which sits in a no-frills strip mall, is &#8220;known for its long waits,&#8221; says Angelica Obregón, who was leaning against her walker on this muggy September morning, eyeing a gray sky that threatened rain.<br />&#8220;People bring chairs, people bring umbrellas, people bring their breakfasts&#8230;because they have a long wait—a long wait,&#8221; says Obregón, 49, who has visited the office repeatedly about her Social Security disability case.<br />The Social Security Administration (SSA)—which touches the lives of virtually every American—was once touted as the preeminent can-do agency. But budget cuts, staff reductions and a growing list of new duties involving everything from Medicare to homeland security processing are taking a toll on the system that administers the nation&#8217;s retirement program, its 1,500 offices in neighborhoods across the country—and the people who rely on them.<br />&#8220;This is a train wreck unfolding right in front of us,&#8221; says Sylvester Schieber, chairman of the Social Security Advisory Board, an independent, bipartisan body whose members are appointed by the president and Congress to report on the agency.<br />&#8220;People will be alarmed,&#8221; Schieber says, &#8220;to learn this agency they think they&#8217;re going to depend on … doesn&#8217;t have the resources to deal with the cases coming its way.&#8221;<br />In small towns and big cities, delays and backlogs at the Social Security office can sometimes be the rule—whether it&#8217;s an hour wait to see a representative in Pasadena, Texas, or a 1,020-day wait for a judge to hear a Social Security disability insurance claim in Atlanta.<br />Calling a Social Security office can be as frustrating as lining up there. Today, an average of 51 percent of all calls to local offices get a busy signal, according to the SSA&#8217;s own study.<br />The Bloomington, Ind., office, for example, serves five counties and has one person answering the phones, says Vicki Ketchum, who was interviewed before she retired as the district manager last month. &#8220;People have told me they&#8217;ve called the office for two weeks and couldn&#8217;t get through,&#8221; she says, &#8220;so they packed up the car and drove up to two hours to get here. That&#8217;s not right.&#8221;<br />Most disturbing may be the backlog in claims for disability insurance. Largely driven by boomers in their 50s—the years when working men and women are most prone to develop illnesses and disabilities, according to the SSA—the number of workers who say they are too sick or disabled to continue to work has grown by a staggering 60 percent in the past few years. Today 750,000 of these vulnerable Americans are waiting an average of 520 days—and in some areas close to three years—for a hearing on their claims.<br />&#8220;The agency is struggling to balance its new responsibilities and its traditional work,&#8221; without added resources, Social Security Commissioner Michael Astrue told a congressional hearing in May.<br />In a more recent interview with the AARP Bulletin, Astrue said that he is &#8220;trying to be optimistic. We&#8217;re doing our best to stay as far ahead of the curve for as long as we can.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Right now,&#8221; he says, &#8220;in most parts of the country the level of service is quite high. But waiting times in some offices are more than what I or anyone else would like to see. And the disability backlog is simply unacceptable.&#8221;<br />Among the agency&#8217;s new responsibilities is determining the eligibility of applicants for Extra Help under Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit. Since SSA started taking applications in July 2005, 6.7 million people have applied. In the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Congress assigned the SSA a whole raft of new homeland security regulations to enforce after 9/11, tightening or changing the rules for issuing or replacing Social Security cards.<br />In 2005, for example, offices were told women could not change their name on Social Security cards to a married name if they had only a foreign marriage certificate as proof, says Paul McGinley, a former operations supervisor in Knoxville, Tenn., who retired this year. &#8220;Fathers who had paid for big destination weddings for their daughters in Jamaica and places like that came down and gave us an earful. We fought that one almost every day for a year and a half until it was changed.&#8221;<br />Immigration-related legislation that Congress is considering would require employers to verify the employment eligibility of all new hires. That could significantly increase workloads at SSA, which already verifies huge numbers of Social Security numbers for employers—84 million in 2006.<br />As the workload has been increasing, the number of SSA employees has been shrinking. The agency has lost 4,000 workers in the last two years alone, and staffing is at its lowest level in 33 years.<br />&#8220;We&#8217;re not just treading water now, we&#8217;re sinking,&#8221; says Rick Warsinskey, who represents the agency&#8217;s managers and supervisors as president of the National Council of Social Security Management Associations.<br />SSA officials say the agency doesn&#8217;t have the funds to add to its staff, or even to replace all the employees who leave. In the last 10 years, the agency&#8217;s budget requests have been reduced first by the administration, which cut them to maintenance level, then by Congress, which cut them even further, &#8220;to the tune of $1 billion,&#8221; Astrue says. The agency&#8217;s periodic reevaluations of people receiving disability payments—to ensure continued eligibility—return $10 in savings for every $1 spent, but even they have been drastically cut back.<br />The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., says his staff &#8220;hears the phrases &#8216;completely outrageous&#8217; and &#8216;entirely unacceptable&#8217; repeatedly from North Dakotans frustrated by their experiences with local Social Security offices.&#8221; His committee recommended a Social Security appropriation of $430 million more than the president&#8217;s budget request for the agency for 2008.<br />The final bill is expected to allocate only $100 million to $125 million more. That might allow the agency to maintain current staffing levels, but not increase them.<br />And yet this month the first of 78 million boomers, three months shy of turning 62, can begin applying for early retirement benefits they are eligible to receive next year. Astrue says that he&#8217;s banking heavily on more boomers using the agency&#8217;s website for a wide range of services. But even if they do, experts say, SSA staffers must review and process the applications—using an antiquated computer system.</p></blockquote>
<p>We seem to be seeing a pattern among agency service delivery systems. Is this part of infrastructure of services and systems for the commons, a broken promise, or lousy administration. </p>
<p>It does appear to be bi-partisan as the fear of being blamed for failure for Iraq is laid on the American people and immobilizes looking at other priorities and other services.</p>

<p>No single approach to the dollar works all the time.  But the most important is interest rate spreads.</p>
<p>The reason the dollar appreciated so much in the early 1980s is that interest rate spreads exploded upward to attract the foreign capital needed to finance the structural federal defictit created by the Reagan tax cuts.  Int he early 1980&#8217;s &#8220;crowding out&#8221; worked through the dollar to crowd out the manufacturing and other sectors sensitive to the dollar rather then the interest rate sensitive sectors.  Later after a new structure of large foreign capital inflows to the US economy  been established as the new norm the currency moves did not have to be as large as they had been in the early 1980s.  But interest rate spreads were still the dominant factor driving the exchange rate.</p>

                                <p>Since the value of the dollar has been a topic in the news as of late, I thought I&#8217;d revisit the topic myself.  Here&#8217;s the value of the dollar, as measured by the Fed&#8217;s <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/summary/indexbc_m.txt">Price adjusted broad dollar index</a> for June of each year starting in 1973, when the dollar was decoupled from gold:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RzIB8B0ThcI/AAAAAAAAA1k/bSe2O4VDerM/s1600-h/Value+of+the+dollar,+June.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RzIB8B0ThcI/AAAAAAAAA1k/bSe2O4VDerM/s320/Value+of+the+dollar,+June.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The dollar declined in value during the Nixon/Ford and then took a tumble when Carter was elected.  </p>
<p>It rose precipitously in the first few years of the Reagan administration &#8211; it really was morning in America.  Why the huge drop at the end of the Reagan administration?  My guess is that the specter of the enormous debt was starting to make a dent on people&#8217;s psyche.  At the end of GHW&#8217;s term, it was essentially unchanged from the end of Reagan&#8217;s administration.</p>
<p>Under Clinton, it declined slightly at first &#8211; it would be hard not to, what with the Wall Street Journal and the various think tanks in Washington explaining how Clinton&#8217;s economic policies were going to destroy the economy.  When that destruction failed to happen, the dollar jumped quite a bit.</p>
<p>The rise continued through the early years of the GW administration &#8211; but eventually reality began to sink in.</p>
<p>Your interpretation?</p>
