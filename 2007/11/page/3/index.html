<blockquote><p>He increased state spending 65.3% from 1996 to 2004</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/11/steve-benen-has-post-on-mitt-romneys.html">Cactus</a> did some fact checking and suggests state spending rose by 61.5% over the past decade.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.bea.gov/regional/gsp">This source</a> suggests Gross State Product for Arkansas rose by 71.7% over the 1996 to 2006 period.  So it matters you is right here.  If nominal state spending rose by less than nominal Gross State Product, Le Club for Rich People have blown it again.  Then again – I wonder if this crew even gets why we compare government spending growth over time to GDP growth over time.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/13728.html">Steve Benen</a> has a post on Mitt Romney&#8217;s recent attacks on Mike Huckabee &#8211; the latter is closing in on the former in the crucial race for one of the particularly, ahem, uncorrelated-with-reality segments of voters in the race for the Republican nomination.    Benen cites <a rhef="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/11/26/romney-to-huckabee-youre-no-ronald-reagan/">CNN</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I must admit that I find the vision and the direction that Ronald Reagan laid out for this country to be very powerful and very compelling,” Romney told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “I’ll tell you, Ronald Reagan would have never raised taxes like Mike Huckabee did, Ronald Reagan would have never said let’s give tuition breaks to illegals like Mike Huckabee did, Ronald Reagan would have never stood by and pushed for a budget that more than doubled during his term as president.”</p>
<p>“Mike Huckabee as a matter of fact has a very different record than Ronald Reagan, and I’m pretty proud that my record stands up quite well.”</p></blockquote>
<p>To quote Benen again:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, I don’t much care which of these two Republicans most resembles Reagan, and it makes very little difference to me whose attacks are more effective.</p>
<p>But if the GOP is going to fight over Reagan’s record, they should at least try to get it right.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was curious about the figure, so I went to Google.  The first spot that came up was the <a href="http://www.clubforgrowth.org/2006/05/mike_huckabee_is_a_liberal_a_c.php">this blurb</a> from the tragically misnamed &#8220;Club for Growth&#8221; which really doesn&#8217;t like the Huck either:</p>
<blockquote><p>He [Huckabee] increased state spending 65.3% from 1996 to 2004</p></blockquote>
<p>Its hard to reconcile an increase in state spending of 65.3% over the length of Huck&#8217;s tenure with more than doubling the budget over the same period, especially since its evident that they&#8217;re both talking about nominal numbers.  Is Romney wrong, or the &#8220;Club for Growth&#8221; wrong, or both?  </p>
<p>Well, according to the <a rhef="http://www.census.gov/prod/99pubs/99statab/sec09.pdf">1999 Statistical Abstract of the United States</a>, the State of Arkansas&#8217; Total Expenditures were equal to $9.661 billion in 1996.  If I&#8217;m reading <a href="http://209.85.173.104/search?q=cache:Tkr5pHHjxg0J:www.arkansas.gov/dfa/budget/documents/fy2006_actual_expenditures.pdf+state+of+arkansas+budget+2006&#038;hl=en&#038;ct=clnk&#038;cd=1&#038;gl=us">this</a> right, the State of Arkansas operating expenditures (which I imagine is the budget more or less) amounted to $15.61 billion in FY 2005-2006.   That&#8217;s about 61.5%, nominal.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl">BLS inflation calculator</a>, we find that $9.661 billion in 1996 is equal to $12.41 billion in 2006&#8230; the real, after inflation increase in Huck&#8217;s budget was 25%.  </p>
<p>So Romney is off here&#8230; and the &#8220;Club for Growth&#8221; is in the ballpark.  (Someone wake  me when Hubbard or Mankiw, Romney&#8217;s economic advisers, explain the discrepancy, or when Romney corrects himself.)</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s look at Reagan, shall we?   <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/hist.html">OMB Table 1.3</a> tells us Federal outlays&#8230; i.e., the budget for 1980, the year before Reagan took office, were equal to $590.9 billion.  In 1988, outlays were 1,064.5 billion&#8230;  an increase of 80%.  In inflation-adjusted dollars, the increase was still an impressive 23%. (By contrast, the nominal and real figures in Clinton&#8217;s term were 29% and 10%, respectively.) </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a dog in this fight&#8230; frankly, I don&#8217;t know which candidate gives the the willies more &#8211; Romney or Huckabee.  But it seems to me that Romney is wrong&#8230;  once you take inflation into account, Huckabee looks very much like Reagan when it comes to the budget.  And I can&#8217;t help but think that Hubbard and Mankiw have found themselves a candidate who is perfect for what they do.</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/26/world/middleeast/26iraq.html?ex=1353733200&#038;en=82a218392f4c5bb2&#038;ei=5088&#038;partner=rssnyt&#038;emc=rss">NY Times had a story</a> the other day on Iraqis returning to their homes&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>By all accounts, Iraqi families who fled their homes in the past two years are returning to Baghdad.</p>
<p>The description of the scope of the return, however, appears to have been massaged by politics. Returnees have essentially become a currency of progress.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>As a result, the tally included Iraqi employees of The New York Times who had visited relatives in Syria but were not among the roughly two million Iraqis who have fled the country.</p>
<p>The figures apparently also included three people suspected of being insurgents arrested Saturday near Baquba in Diyala Province. The police described them as local residents who had fled temporarily to Syria, then returned.</p>
<p>Some Iraqi lawmakers said that overly broad figures were being used intentionally.</p>
<p>“They are using this number because they want to show that Maliki is succeeding,” said Salim Abdullah, a lawmaker and member of the largest Sunni bloc, known as the Accordance Front, referring to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. “But this does not make the number correct. I think dozens of Iraqis return home daily, but not 1,600.”</p>
<p>A half-dozen owners of Iraqi travel agencies and drivers who regularly travel to Syria agreed that the numbers misrepresented reality.</p>
<p>They said that the flow of returnees peaked last month, with more than 50 families arriving daily from Syria at Baghdad’s main drop-off point. Since Nov. 1, they said, the numbers have declined, and on Sunday morning, during a period when several buses used to appear, only one came. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A United Nations survey released last week, of 110 Iraqi families leaving Syria, also seemed to dispute the contentions of officials in Iraq that people are returning primarily because they feel safer.</p>
<p>The survey found that 46 percent were leaving because they could not afford to stay; 25 percent said they fell victim to a stricter Syrian visa policy; and only 14 percent said they were returning because they had heard about improved security.</p>
<p>Underscoring a widely held sense of hesitation, many of those who come back to Iraq do not return to their homes. Clambering off the bus on Sunday, a woman who gave her name as Um Dima, mother of Dima, said that friends were still warning her not to go back to her house in Dora, a violent neighborhood in south Baghdad. So for now, she said, she will move in with her parents in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>Raad al-Kihani, a prominent Shiite tribal leader in Baghdad and supporter of the prime minister, said that most people returning were still restricted by the fear of sectarian violence. “There are no Shiite families moving back to Sunni neighborhoods and no Sunnis moving back to Shiite neighborhoods,” he said.</p>
<p>The Iraqi government is using incentives and aggressive public relations to try to bring more people home. Iraqi officials plan to pay for buses to transport Iraqis from Syria. Prominent government figures recently visited Saab al-Bor, a largely abandoned town near Baghdad, to emphasize that families should feel safe enough to return.</p>
<p>The Displacement Ministry offers 1 million Iraqi dinar, about $800, to internally displaced families who can prove they have returned home with a letter from the police and their neighborhood council. But the movement has been limited. As of Thursday, 4,358 internally displaced families, about 25,000 people, had returned to their homes in Baghdad, the ministry’s registry of payments to returnees said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people are still leaving their homes — 28,017 were internally displaced in October, according to the latest United Nations figures. In all, the United Nations estimates that 2.4 million Iraqis are still internally displaced, with many occupying someone else’s home.</p></blockquote>
<p>Something is seriously wrong when people deported from Syria are pointed to as a sign that Iraq is becoming more peaceful.</p>

<blockquote><p>A penny saved is a penny burned.<br />A bird in hand is worth I don&#8217;t know how many in the bush.<br />Never invest your money in anything that eats or needs repairing.<br />Always spend your money before you have it.<br />There&#8217;s no such thing a free lunch (unless you;ve borrowed to buy it.<br />Money grows on trees (and in the ground!)<br />Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent leverage.<br />He who can, does; he who cannot, borrows.<br />The buck starts depreciating here.<br />It not what you pay a man, but when and in what currency you pay him that counts.<br />A fool and his money are easily parted when a bank is involved.<br />Nothing is certain but death taxes (and inflation).<br />Give a man a fish, he eats for a day; Teach a man to fish, he eats always. Teach a man to borrow in order to buy assets and he&#8217;ll be richer than Croesus.<br />Buy what thou hast no need of, else it will cost twice as much tomorrow.<br />When in doubt, leverage to buy assets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some might find this interesting.  While the press frequently talks about the deficit, they rarely distinguish between the total deficit and the primary deficit.  The primary deficit is the total deficit less debt servicing costs; i.e., interest payments.  The government’s long run budget constraint is really determined by the primary deficit and not the total deficit.  </p>
<p>The chart below shows the primary surplus/deficit for “on-budget” accounts as a percent of GDP.  In OMB accounting lingo, interest against the on-budget accounts is usually greater than net interest because the off-budget accounts (primarily FICA) are running a surplus and therefore accrue positive interest receipts.  So the FICA surpluses not only mask the on-budget deficit, but they also mask the interest payments required to service the on-budget deficit.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R0wTr7YBdMI/AAAAAAAAA4Y/JQmpNK7hKl4/s1600-h/2slugbaits+-+surplus.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R0wTr7YBdMI/AAAAAAAAA4Y/JQmpNK7hKl4/s320/2slugbaits+-+surplus.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The chart clearly shows that up until the mid-1970s grown-ups were in charge.  The government ran small primary surpluses during the good times and small primary deficits during the lean times, all the while paying down the massive debt from WW2.  But following the 1974-1975 recession we see the grown-ups went on vacation and no one was around to take away the punch bowl.  Party on Garth!  Thus began the era of permanent structural on-budget deficits.  </p>
<p>But during the Clinton years we see where fiscal sanity returned again and, to a large extent, reversed much of the damage done over the preceding 20 years.  Who’d a thunk it.  The President with the undisciplined personal life restores fiscal sanity to Washington.  By the end of the Clinton years economists and the Fed were actually beginning to worry that in a few years there might not be enough public Treasuries to facilitate open market operations.  Alan Greenspan actually wrung his hands over the prospect of massive Treasury surpluses moving into private equity markets.  </p>
<p>Then along came Bush 43.  While it is true that there were small on-budget primary surpluses in 2006 and 2007, those surpluses were disappointingly small given where we were in the business cycle.  We’re now in the sixth year of the economic expansion, so we would have expected much larger on-budget primary surpluses.  The Bush years were a blown opportunity to set the country’s fiscal house in order.  For a supposedly religious President you’d think that Bush might have paid more attention to the story of Joseph and the granaries.  </p>
<p>Data comes from the White House&#8217;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/hist.html">OMB Tables</a>.</p>
<p>The on-budget total surplus/deficit number. The difference between the two tables is the on-budget primary surplus/deficit.  This value was then divided by GDP (OMB table 10.1)</p>

<blockquote><p>Here is what&#8217;s happening: two companies-DaVita and Fresenius-provide most of the kidney dialysis services in the U.S. They want Congress to force kidney patients to stay on private insurance for a longer period of time before they can qualify for Medicare.<br />Usually, patients need to be 65 years old before they qualify for Medicare. But in 1972, because the high cost of dialysis put care out of reach for all but the wealthiest patients, Congress made the historic decision to extend Medicare coverage to dialysis patients of all ages. But patients who need dialysis have to stay on private insurance for 30 months before they are eligible for Medicare. DaVita and Fresenius want to make patients wait longer-another year-before they can get access to the program.<br />It&#8217;s not hard to figure out why DaVita and Fresenius want to keep kidney patients out of Medicare. These companies can typically charge private insurers-and ultimately employers and workers-nearly three times more than they can charge Medicare for the same services.<br />It&#8217;s staggering how much money is at stake with this &#8220;small&#8221; change. It&#8217;s estimated that dialysis providers like DaVita and Fresenius would cash in a $2 billion&#8230;over five years&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This note would have escaped my attention unless kidney dialysis was not personal.  Mrs. rdan&#8217;s brother had an infection in a knee from minor surgery that somehow spread.  In three months either the infection or the massive antibiotics to treat the infection caused scarring in both kidneys to the point of shutdown.  His job involved quotas which he found he could not maintain when on dialysis due to impaired stamina, which also takes 3-4 hours times three a week to live, so he lost his job, and access over time to insurance.</p>
<p>He had worked at this company for ten years and was a good worker.</p>
<p>What, if any, help does a community offer for the random events of the universe?</p>

                                <p>I am member of AAII (American Association of Individual Investors). They send out their Investor survey results every week. This weeks:<br />Bullish 25.58% Long term avg. 39.3%<br />Neutral 21.71% Long term avg. 31.9%<br />Bearish 52.71% Long term avg. 28.8%</p>
<p>We have all read exuberant stories about how wonderful Black Friday was. The WSJ is doing it&#8217;s part to <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/holidaysales/2007/11/15/holiday-pessimism-isnt-universal/">promote sales</a> prior to the event:<br />
<blockquote>For those seeking a second opinion on the gloomy holiday spending outlook, here it is:A survey of 2,570 Americans with household incomes of more than $35,000 suggests that the expectations of weak holiday sales are overblown.<br />“The doom and gloom is overstated. Unemployment is low. Real incomes are healthy,” said Michael J. Silverstein, a BCG senior partner. “Consumers overall predict that this holiday season will be just as good, if not better, than last.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately this is all based on a month old survey. A time when the $3.199 I just paid today to fill the oil tank did not exist. The schizophrenic side of WSJ had this to say<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/holidaysales/2007/11/16/a-strong-black-friday-might-be-false-signal/"> the next day</a>, 11/16/07:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fred Crawford, managing director at Alix Partners, a turnaround consultant, says: “The reason so many retailers are coming out aggressively is that they’re expecting a bad season.” </p></blockquote>
<p>There is a nice little chart of the expectations of the big retailers with this article. They&#8217;re not to excited.</p>
<p>I asked at a forum only for florist and related business: How&#8217;s it going now that Thanksgiving is past?<br />Some responses:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>“We hear a lot about how bad the US economy is doing but things are&#8217;nt great in Europe either. Retail suffered a lot in 2007 and Ireland was no different .Some times during the year I felt like tearing my hair out . It was really quiet during the summer but picked up from Sept and Nov was brilliant for me.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, it has been the slowest Sept. and Nov. that we&#8217;ve ever had. As I said in a previous post, maybe our moving has confused customers or it&#8217;s the economy. It is really scary to have just made a hefty investment in a new building along with moving and renovation costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>In our area, we can tell that gas prices are affecting sales &#8211; both holiday &#038; everyday.We filled up 2 vans yesterday at @ 3.15/gallon (OUCH!!). My local tracking trends tell me that when customers have less money to spend, they are looking for more &#8216;longer lasting&#8221;, &#8220;higher perceived value&#8221; items. Generally for us, that means that or fruit baskets business greatly increases, and often our plant/poinsettia business increases. We will be cautious in our fresh flower buying&#8230;.staying ahead of the game, but not in too deep!</p>
<p>Sales in Sept. were in the expected range but October was down significantly. November is not too bad but not great. Sure hope December brings better things or I will have to lay someone off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Our November so far, compared to the last year&#8217;s:<br />Local sales: up 17%, Wire-in: down 25%, Wire-out: same. Actually, it was disappointing. We usually do 20-30% better than last year&#8217;s numbers; this year is our 3rd year beginning July. The problem was the average sales price. Compared to the last year, this year&#8217;s average sales price in November is 10% down. It&#8217;s so clear. Our customers are cutting back the expense. We will use this info to adjust our price point for Christmas, which is more important than November sales.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is an even sadder story by a shop owner of 26 yrs in Kansas who bought houses, put kids through college etc, etc and is now thinking of closing because they can&#8217;t make it.<br />
<blockquote>We used to have a full business district, 3 clothing, 1 shoe, 3 hardware, 8 restaurants, 2 convenience stores, 2 pharmacies, 2 flowershops, 2 gift, 1 childrens store, 2 grocery, Dollar General, Duckwalls, and 1 lumberyard. We are down to me, 1 gift, 1 pharmacy, lumberyard, 1 grocery, Dollar General, 1 convenience, 4 restaurants. I have heard that Duckwalls and the gift store are going out of business by Jan 1. We are down to one mortuary, used to have 3. MY TOWN IS DYING! Small town america is dying.</p></blockquote>
<p>I worked in high school for a small family retail business, and the owner noted that such businesses were always ahead (by 6 months) of the national rhetoric as to the state of the economy.  My shop peaked in the summer of 2006. This year even credit card sales are down where as last year only cash was off but credit card sale were up. We were off 3.4% for the year until August hit. We are now 7.8% off. People are not even trying to spend “discretionary income”.</p>
<p>Here is one article quoting the <a href="http://www.gazette.net/stories/111607/businew10730_32368.shtml">National Retailers Federation </a>concerning Maryland:<br />
<blockquote>‘‘Our annual survey showed our members to be very pessimistic this season,” said Thomas Saquella, president of the 600-member state retailers group. One-third of business executives who responded to the Maryland survey predicted sales decreases during the holiday season, compared with only 7 percent in 2006. Only one-third believed that third-quarter sales provided some positive momentum for the holiday season, compared with two-thirds last year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Referring to the accuracy of prior surveys:<br />
<blockquote>If the projections are that accurate this year, this holiday season would see the smallest gain since 2002. Sales that year increased nationally by only 1.3 percent, according to the retail federation.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aDisryZePitQ&#038;">Bloomberg</a> had this to say yesterday:<br />
<blockquote>U.S. consumers spent an average of 3.5 percent less during the post-Thanksgiving Day holiday weekend than a year earlier as retailers slashed prices to lure customers grappling with higher food and energy costs. </p></blockquote>
<p>And, last but not least I dropped of the shop van at my friends repair shop this morning making an appointment for the personal van. He had today and ½ of tomorrow scheduled. The rest of the weekly chart was empty. He started building a new house this past March. Now he&#8217;s feeling the pinch cause he can&#8217;t sell his current house. The new house would have been paid in full if he could have sold the current house. Best laid plans&#8230;.</p>
<p>My sweet keep complaining about being poor (I told her she had to choose between Celine Dion and 1 of her weeks at the beach). I keep telling her we&#8217;re not poor, we&#8217;re broke. She responds with: &#8220;And why did we buy this flower shop?&#8221;</p>

But what if, even at the thing they have a comparative advantage, their absolute disadvantage is huge?  (And we all know some people like that.

<p>The Conference Board, a non-profit research group whose output includes the Consumer Confidence Index and Leading Economic Indicators <a href="http://www.conference-board.org/publications/describe.cfm?id=1379">reported</a> earlier this month that the percentage of households with discretionary income (as defined by the study, are those whose spendable income exceeds that held by households with similar demographic features) has increased to 63.5% in 2006 from 52.1% in 2002.  </p>
<p>In January 2005, the Conference Board <a href="http://www.conference-board.org/utilities/pressDetail.cfm?press_ID=2550">reported</a>  for the 2003/2004 period that the percentage of the American population with discretionary income had edged down to 51 percent, compared with 52 percent six years ago. </p>
<p>From March 1983 to March 1987, the number of households with discretionary income <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1153/is_n6_v113/ai_8682840">rose</a> from 28 percent to 29 percent of households.</p>
<p>From 2003/2004-2006, nominal average discretionary income increased 12.4% overall, but only increased 7% for the segment earning $100,000 or more (the latter is potentially attributable to either slower growth of the existing segment, or a large number of new households at the lower end that keep the average from growing, or a combination of the two).  From 1997/1998-2003/2004 nominal average discretionary income increased 27.4%, but decreased 8.6% for the segment earning $100,000 or more.  </p>
<p>2006 &#8211; Average discretionary income for [households earning more than $100,000 of] $66,451 is <a href="http://www.conference-board.org/utilities/pressDetail.cfm?press_ID=3254">2.7 times the national average</a>.</p>
<p>2003/2004 &#8211; Average discretionary income for [households earning more than $100,000], – $62,110 – is <a href="http://www.conference-board.org/utilities/pressDetail.cfm?press_ID=2550">nearly three times above the U.S. average of $21,657</a>.</p>
<p>1997/1998 &#8211; [T]he Conference Board . . . finds that average discretionary income among such affluent households [those earning more than $100,000]  exceeds $68,000 &#8212; nearly four times the U.S. average. . . . The study uses 1997 and 1998 data and defines discretionary income as income that is above median expenditure levels for similar households.  The last time the study was done, in 1993, it used different criteria, but found that the <a href="http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/pen-l/1999m08.b/msg00139">affluent had three times as much discretionary income</a>.</p>

                                <p>ILSM has been reading more about littoral combat ships.  As he read the articles, it occurs to him that perhaps a small glossary would be useful.  Not finding one, he developed his own&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Access: The ability to destroy the sovereignty of any entity we wish.</p>
<p>Anti Access: The enemy states&#8217; strategy to prevent the US from taking it over.</p>
<p>Asymmetrical Threats: The target is a kid with a small arm and we need to spend billions to kill each one. Code word for very expensive!</p>
<p>Capability: The ability to perform some unnecessary function. Becomes equal to a need, even though there is no real issue to get the capability to satisfy. The foundation of how the DoD describes what it desires. Never question the capability.</p>
<p>Codes for Military Terms I:</p>
<p>Concept: Addresses the capability. Code for describing hugely expensive things to deliver the capability.</p>
<p>Data Fusion: Bill Gates uses it this must be an important thing for developing the capability to sell this system.</p>
<p>Distributed Force: US forces garrisoned around the world can assist each other the same as X Legion marching across the Rubicon.</p>
<p>Employ: The least likely thing that could happen to the weapon system is to use it.</p>
<p>Flexibility: The key to military success. Not mentioned in the LCS article.</p>
<p>Littoral Environment: A place where the Blue Water Navy can cover a profitable new generation of ships which the shipyards cannot design.</p>
<p>Mission: Fictitious use for a capability. Applied concepts. Usually formulated as the most expensive, large forces way to do a job that is not needed to be done. </p>
<p>Modular: Refers to the modules going into the platform to keep it impossible to see whether the thing is done, works or delivers some capability.</p>
<p>Modules: Need huge ship that can be reconfigured for new missions. Make it impossible to figure out what the ship is supposed to do. Establish the need for a huge logistics tail.Code word for incredibly expensive!</p>
<p>Network Centric: A reason for huge communications infrastructure so some guy in Washington can help the on scene commander to justify a capability.</p>
<p>Open Systems Architecture: Archaic SW geek term. Sounds really technical. The kind of thing that some geek will know it when they see it. Fortunately admirals are not geeks, so they see it when it is done. Code word for very expensive!</p>
<p>Optimal Manning Concepts: Spend a ton more money on hardware and software so you don&#8217;t need so many sailors.</p>
<p>Platform: Code word for ill defined hugely expensive ships, airplanes or vehicles. Has to be complex and extremely expensive. Creates the environment to continually spend money to increase the platform&#8217;s complexity. Never ending engineering, keep the designers in the green.</p>
<p>Reconfigure: What you do to justify the modules. Usually takes a huge amount of time and so the flexibility suggested is not delivered. Code word for very expensive!</p>
<p>Smart Control Systems: How the guy in Washington makes sure the guy in the field is (not) doing it right.</p>
<p>Stealthy Surface Combatant: A big submarine that does not submerge. Can only operate at night and or inclement weather. Code word for very expensive!</p>
<p>Support Diplomatic Efforts: Fiction that the US has any diplomacy. Gunboat diplomacy.</p>
<p>Technology: The things that provide the capability, but not quite ready to put in the field.</p>
<p>Threat: Fear, fictitious fear that creates the pretense for a mission. Capabilities search for these. Should be identified before capabilities, but that is too limiting. Have to be creative with the capabilities then find the threats. Like cave dwelling Islamofascists.</p>
