                                <p>William Kristol Hearts Machiavellian Presidency</p>
<p>When did Faux News decide to slip truth serum into the coffee served to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/07/08/kristol-machiavellian">Bill Kristol</a>? </p>
<blockquote><p>This morning, the Weekly Standard’s Bill Kristol &#8211; who accurately predicted the President’s decision to commute Libby’s sentence &#8211; suggested the order was timed to provide political cover for the decision by attacking President Clinton. “Here’s why the president acted the way he did. He knew Bill Clinton was joining Hillary in Iowa on July 4th. No, I’m serious,” Kristol said. “So on July 2d, Ed Gillespie, who’s a very canny Republican operator, said, Let’s pardon Libby. Clinton will rise to the bait, and we could spend the last half of the week debating the unbelievable Clinton pardons against the defensible Bush pardon.” Kristol concluded, “I regard this as an extremely clever Machiavellian move by the president. It cheers me up about the Bush White House, and I’m really heartened.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s recall how <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipd/A0524702.html">Machiavellian</a> is usually defined:</p>
<blockquote><p>being or acting in accordance with the principles of government analyzed in Machiavelli&#8217;s The Prince, in which political expediency is placed above morality and the use of craft and deceit to maintain the authority and carry out the policies of a ruler is described. </p>
<p>characterized by subtle or unscrupulous cunning, deception, expediency, or dishonesty.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep – this White House is Machiavellian.  One has to admire Kristol’s admission, but might we suggest a true conservative would never be heartened that the government has turned Machiavellian.</p>

                                <p>It seems that Jim Lehrer choose to endure David Brooks on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/july-dec07/sblibby_07-06.html">News Hour</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And my rationale was this &#8211; and I think it was the same as the president&#8217;s &#8211; that Scooter Libby did lie. He did commit perjury. And, so, he deserves to be punished. He deserved the past two years of disgrace, and maybe he deserved six months in prison.  But this &#8211; that crime was surrounded by a vast circus of hypocrisy and partisan dishonesty</p></blockquote>
<p>What?  David Brooks is about to blast the right for their circus of hypocrisy and partisan dishonesty?  Oh no, I interrupted him in the middle of his sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>starting with the original case, which was allegedly about outing a CIA agent, when it was never really about that, because, once it turned out that was Richard Armitage, nobody cared anymore, and then the hypocrisy over whether somebody should go to jail for perjury, with Democrats saying one thing with Clinton, another thing with Libby</p></blockquote>
<p>Couldn’t someone tell Mr. Brooks that a CIA agent WAS outed?  And that Richard Armitage blundered himself into the middle of Dick Cheney’s scheme is irrelevant.  Of course, Bill Clinton was not involved with PlameGate but David has to go to the standard rightwing well. </p>
<p>It also seems that <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2007/jul/06/letter_to_a_neighbor">Larry Johnson</a> has to endure the fact that David Brooks moved into his neighbor.  I suspect Larry was rather angry at a recent oped by <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/2007/07/03/opinion/03brooks.html&#038;OQ=_rQ3D1Q26nQ3DTopQ252fOpinionQ252fEditorialsQ2520andQ2520OpQ252dEdQ252fOpQ252dEdQ252fColumnistsQ252fDavidQ2520Brooks&#038;OP=4e285a96Q2FQ27LXQ5DQ27myF88mQ27Q2FeecQ27ecQ27eGQ278Q51Q22Q7BQ228Q7BQ27eGQ5DF887y,qmgY">David Brooks</a> until he read the suggested edits from <a href="http://www.davidcorn.com/archives/2007/07/a_memo_for_davi.php">David Corn</a>. Check out Larry’s letter to his new neighbor.  In case, you are wondering about the title of this post, Larry <a href="http://noquarter.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/07/bobos-mailbox.html">explains</a>. </p>
<p>One of the claims that Mr. Brooks made – which is another rightwing favorite talking point – is how Joe Wilson lied in his NY Times oped.  Just in case you missed out this claim has been thoroughly debunked &#8211; <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/014985.php">Josh Marshall</a> goes over this one more time.  For all his smiling and soft talk – it has been well established that David Brooks is as dishonest as the rest of these water carriers for this corrupt White House.  So why on earth does PBS invite this hack on their shows?  Maybe they feel sorry for him as he can’t even get a decent mail box without help from a neighbor.</p>

Kraemer and Jason Dedrick</a> of UC-Irvine, who strive to figure out where the value-added from the iPod is created.  Varian notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who makes the Apple iPod Here’s a hint: It is not Apple. The company outsources the entire manufacture of the device to a number of Asian enterprises, among them Asustek, Inventec Appliances and Foxconn.  But this list of companies isn’t a satisfactory answer either: They only do final assembly. What about the 451 parts that go into the iPod? Where are they made and by whom?</p></blockquote>
<p>What is really interesting is that only $144 of the value-added goes to the manufacturers so when you paid $299, $155 of the value-added went either to the distributors who sold the iPods for Apple or to Apple itself for the designer of this device.  The authors estimate that about 25% of the retail price was captured by the distributors with Apple getting $80 per iPod:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on these values, Apple’s gross profit on those units would be $80, which is 36% of the $224 estimated wholesale price. This $80 profit is greater than the price of any single input, so it is definitely greater than the value added for any of its partners.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Dark Matter types should love this paper.  Others who might find it interesting are transfer pricing geeks as well as accountants.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: This iPod accounting got me thinking about that old rule of thumb popularized by Robert Goldscheider.  <a href="http://ip-updates.blogspot.com/2004/08/ip-law-business-goldscheiders-25-rule.html">IP Updates</a> explains what it is and where it came from:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Robert Goldscheider arrived at this now-famous calculation in 1959 when one of his clients, Philco Corporation, had about 18 European licensees for its radio and phonograph patents. Goldscheider calculated that Philco&#8217;s licensees assumed the major risk of commercializing their products, about 75 percent. That left 25 percent of the risk to licensor Philco, reflected in a 25/75 percent split of pretax profits.</p></blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that in these particular deals, system profits were about 20% of sales with the royalty rate being about 5% of sales.  Many IP economists have criticized the use of this rule of thumb especially for sectors where profit margins were very high.  If one thinks about the $80 per iPod that Apple gets as a percentage of either wholesale prices or even retail prices, it exceeds 25% of revenues.  The authors of this paper note that much of the value-added for the manufacturers and distributors is likely captured by wages rather than profits.  So as a percent of system profits, Apple’s take is much higher than 25%.</p>

                                <p>Andrew Samwick offers us <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/07/how-to-advise-on-fiscal-policy.html">How to Advice on Fiscal Policy</a>.  While the whole post is worth a read, let me offer some highlights:</p>
<blockquote><p>The overriding problem in conducting fiscal policy is that politicians, in both the executive and legislative branches, face electoral pressure to please their current constituencies. It is extremely tempting for them to boost spending or lower taxes today, handing out windfalls to today&#8217;s voters and leaving an unrepresented constituency &#8211; future taxpayers &#8211; to foot the bill.  It takes an enormous amount of energy to resist that temptation. That energy has to come from the politician&#8217;s advisers &#8230; There are other advisers with a central role to play in fiscal policy, however, who are Presidential nominees who undergo Senate confirmation and who can be called to testify to Congress on the President&#8217;s policies. We should expect them to be the ones who look at the larger picture, who take a longer horizon into their policy discussions, and who do the heavy lifting to help the politician resist the temptation to use future generations&#8217; resources to buy votes today. On fiscal policy, the three main advisers are the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.  To address the overriding problem, these three advisers must insist on an explicit budget target &#8230; The standard can be that simple, and it isn&#8217;t as austere as I&#8217;m trying to make it sound. It doesn&#8217;t rule out cutting taxes during the weak part of a business cycle, for example, but it does rule out cutting taxes to run a deficit that the Administration has no intention of paying back during the strong part of a business cycle. As a corollary, it does rule out passing tax cuts with explicit sunset provisions and then arguing to extend them with the budget not in balance … Twice a year, the Administration makes an economic forecast to underlie the budget or its mid-session review. I&#8217;d be surprised if you ever see such a forecast that predicts an upcoming recession. That means that every budget or mid-session review should be projecting on-budget surpluses or their quick resumption if we are just coming out of a recession. As I&#8217;ve discussed elsewhere, the &#8220;cut the deficit in half in five years&#8221; policy was at variance with this standard … Taxing someone in 2020 to pay for our spending binge in 2003 violates my notions of fairness, and that is a substantially more salient issue here than any additional concerns about efficiency.</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, the actual fiscal policy stances of the Bush Administration are not consistent with how Dr. Samwick would have advised the President.  Perhaps the internal advice that Glenn Hubbard and Greg Mankiw gave President Bush were roughly consistent with how Andrew Samwick would have advised the President.  If so, the President clearly ignored his CEA.  Which raises the question as to why these two gentlemen did not resign sooner? </p>
<p>One note to Andrew Samwick on this excellent post &#8211; I suspect the sources you link are very good ones, but when I tried to reference them, the links were not working properly.</p>

                                <p>The latest from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 132,000 in June, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.5 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Employment rose in several service-providing industries, while manufacturing employment continued to decline. Average hourly earnings rose by 6 cents, or 0.3 percent, over the month.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Household Survey actually reports an employment increase equal to 197,000, which increased the employment to population ratio from 63% to 63.1% &#8211; which kept the unemployment rate steady even as the labor force participation rate edged up.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=07&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=decent_job_growth_bad_producti">Dean Baker</a> reports a few details:</p>
<blockquote><p>The June jobs numbers came in somewhat better than expected largely due to the government adding 40,000 jobs. The health care sector accounted for 42,300 of the 92,000 jobs created by the private sector. Over the last three months the health care sector has accounted for 131,000 of the 345,000 jobs created by the private sector or 38 percent. The better than expected job growth implies another quarter of weak productivity growth. With hours growing at a 2.3 percent annual rate, productivity for the quarter will be approximately 1.0 percent if GDP comes in near the consensus forecast. That means that we will have had three full years with average productivity growth of less than 1.5 percent. This has to raise serious questions about whether the post-1995 productivity upturn has come to an end.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2007/07/june-employment-report.html">CalculatedRisk</a> looks at employment growth since President Bush took office as well as employment in the residential construction and retail employment sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19630959">AP</a> covers the latest from the BLS and wants you to believe that wages are rising:</p>
<blockquote><p>The latest picture of the nation’s employment climate, released by the Labor Department on Friday, also showed that workers saw solid gains in their wages last month &#8230; Workers saw modest wage gains in June.  Average hourly earning rose to $17.38, a 0.3 percent increase from May. That matched the rise anticipated by economists. Over the last 12 months, wages grew by 3.9 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>So were these “solid gains” or “modest wage gains”?  A 3.9 percent increase over a year might sound nice until one realizes that AP is talking about nominal increases.  Our graph shows average hourly earnings of production workers in constant dollar (1982) terms, that is, in real terms.  Notice something.  In May 2007, the real wage was $8.26 – which was the same as the real wage as of September 2002.  Over this period, real wages have varied. During periods when inflation exceeded nominal wages increases, the reported real wage declined.  For other periods, the nominal wage increase actually did exceed inflation so the reported real wage increased.  So with real wages so a lot of variability but no particular trend, why is AP trying to convince us workers are better off.  Did they outsource their reporting to Lawrence Kudlow?  </p>

<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2007/07/06/fed-may-be-questioning-labor-market-tightness">Greg Ip</a> cites Janet Yellen and a few other smart folks suggesting that the labor market is not all that tight:</p>
<blockquote><p>But there are signs the labor market isn’t as tight as the low unemployment rate suggests. One reason is the absence of a notable acceleration in wage growth. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in June from May and were up 3.9% from a year earlier, in line with the rate of growth for the past year. The more comprehensive employment cost index grew 3.5% from the previous year in the first quarter, in the range of the past several years. Broader measures of compensation accelerated in the first quarter, but that may reflect the vagaries of employee stock options and one-time bonuses &#8230; Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Janet Yellen, in a speech delivered via video conference to the Risk Management Institute of Singapore early Friday local time, said, it’s possible “labor markets may not actually be particularly tight,” citing the restrained growth in employment costs &#8230; The low unemployment rate reflects in part a recent drop in the “participation rate” &#8211; the share of working-age people either on the job or looking for work &#8211; from 66.4% in December to 66% in May. It edged back to 66.1% in June. Much of the drop in the participation rate has been among teenagers; contrary to the Fed’s expectation, the participation rate of older workers has actually risen. Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, noted the participation rate has fallen especially sharply for young people, blacks and Hispanics, groups who are “especially sensitive to the economy’s ups and downs.” If those missing workers were reported as unemployed, the jobless rate would be 5% instead of 4.5%, he said in a report.</p></blockquote>
<p>We should note that the discussion of labor compensation was in terms of nominal growth with real growth being near zero.  We should also that the employment-population ratio 64.4% at the end of 2006 and is only 63.1% now.  Finally, we should give hat tips to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/labor-force-par.html">Mark Thoma</a> and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/how-close-are-w.html">Brad DeLong</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update III</strong>:  Go figure &#8211; <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZGQzNzg4YjNhNGU1OThmMzhjMzdjNWFhYjQ2ZjViOGQ=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> thinks the labor market is great:</p>
<blockquote><p>Year-to-year wages for non-management workers increased 3.9 percent. Comparing that with the 2.3 percent increase in the headline inflation personal consumer deflator (for May, the latest month) leaves about 1.5 percent improvement in real wages. The unemployment rate remains at a historically low 4.5 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Kudlow does not realize that the employment to population ratio has declined over the past six months – but that labor force participation rate has also declined.  Incidentally, could someone tell this National Review nitwit that the unemployment rate has been much lower than 4.5%?  Heck &#8211; it was below 4% towards the end of the Clinton years.  And that wasn&#8217;t even near the historical low.  </p>
<p>Sure real wages in May 2007 were higher than that really low $8.17 (1982$) figure for May 2006.  But real wages in May 2007 were no higher than they were as of September 2002.  Leave it Kudlow the Klown to confuse what is noise with what is NOT an upward trend.</p>
<p><strong>Update IV</strong>: <a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-commerce/2007/7/6/economy-booming-so-what-might-start-the-next-recession.html">James Pethokoukis</a> outdoes even Kudlow for dumbest comment on wages:</p>
<blockquote><p>Real wages for workers &#8211; not managers &#8211; increased by 3.9 percent, year over year. Deflate by the core May inflation rate of 2.3 percent &#8211; the latest numbers available &#8211; and you get real wage growth of 1.6 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Real wage growth minus inflation equals real wage growth.  James?  That is really stupid.  No, nominal wages grew by 3.9%.  The rest seems to be a cut and paste from Kudlow’s Korner Krap.  Both of you – consumer prices from May to May grew by over 2.6%.  I checked the BLS data for the period from July 1979 to July 1980.  Nominal wages during the year rose by 7.86% but consumer prices rose by 13.13% over the same period.  But here’s the rub.  Consumer prices did not change from June 1980 to July 1980.  So this Kudlow-Pethokoukis calculus would have suggested a large real wage increase for a period where real wages fell. <em>Brilliant!</em></p>

                                <p>This post looks at the prime earning demographic and whether that can explain some of the patterns in real median income we observe in Presidential administrations since Ike. What’s the prime earning demographic? According to the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p08ar.html">Census</a>, since 1983 it has been the 45 – 54 year old cohort. Before 1982, it was the 35 – 44 year old group (with one exception, 1978, which we will disregard). </p>
<p>This is a follow-up to yesterday’s post where I looked at real median income and 45 – 54 year olds… I wrongly assumed that 45 – 54 year olds were the prime demographic through the entire post WW2 era. Apologies. </p>
<p>The point of the post is simple…if demographics are the explanation for the extremely fast increase in real median income during the JFK/LBJ and Clinton administrations noted in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/real-median-income-by-presidential.html">my post on real median income</a>, presumably we’d expect to see much more of these prime-earning folks wandering around during those administrations than at other points. Similarly, given the drops in real median observed during the Carter, GHW, Nixon/Ford, and GW administrations, we’d expect to see a lower percentage of these high earning folks during those administrations. So let’s see.</p>
<p>Demographic data from 1980 to 2005 comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0011.xls">here</a>, and demographic data going back to 1952 was obtained from <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/pre-1980/PE-11.html">here</a>. Real median income also comes from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p07ar.html">Census </a>.</p>
<p>So here’s what the prime earning population as a percentage of the total population looks like over time.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yWzb6OFI/AAAAAAAAAYo/9MKxO38eOoI/s1600-h/Prime+Demographic,+Graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yWzb6OFI/AAAAAAAAAYo/9MKxO38eOoI/s320/Prime+Demographic,+Graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Note… the big drop is the year the prime earning group changed from one cohort to another. </p>
<p>Here’s a summary…</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yRzb6OEI/AAAAAAAAAYg/I6GMWZuuZL8/s1600-h/Prime+Demographic,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yRzb6OEI/AAAAAAAAAYg/I6GMWZuuZL8/s320/Prime+Demographic,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Only 6 years of the Reagan admin was used because of the change in cohorts.) </p>
<p>Well… Clinton did have the fastest growth rate in the high earning folks… so maybe some of his real median income performance is due to that. But he was followed by GHW, Carter, and GW… under whom real median income growth was, well, not exactly growth for those of us who consider growth to be movement in a positive direction. JFK/LBJ, under whom real median income grew faster than under any other administration, actually had the biggest decrease in the prime earning demographic. So for whatever reason, it doesn’t seem like the percentage of the population in the prime earning demographic doesn’t seem like the driver of earnings in any given administration. Some figures…</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yDTb6OCI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/ZfM9QCHerFo/s1600-h/Prime+Demographic,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yDTb6OCI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/ZfM9QCHerFo/s320/Prime+Demographic,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Yes, there is a positive correlation between the change in the percentage of the population that is made up of this prime demographic and the percentage change in the real median income, but its not particularly high. Interestingly enough… the correlation hits its peak some six years out… the change in the percentage of people in the prime earning demographic in any given year is correlated with percentage changes in real median income six years later.</p>
<p>And now a graph.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yKDb6ODI/AAAAAAAAAYY/B9fc5_k74JQ/s1600-h/Prime+Demographic,+Graph+2.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ro4yKDb6ODI/AAAAAAAAAYY/B9fc5_k74JQ/s320/Prime+Demographic,+Graph+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So… the excellent performance of the real median income during the JFK/LBJ, Clinton, and to a lesser extent Reagan years doesn’t seem to be explained the prime demographic? And as we’ve noted in earlier posts, economic performance is also not explained by the Congress, the recessions, lags, etc. Which brings us back, as always to… either its policy or its quite a coincidence, but almost all of the series we’ve looked at so far (economic or social) have JFK/LBJ and/or Clinton at the top of the heap.</p>

<p>The London Doctors and the Myth of the Suicide Bomber (Part II)</p>
<p>Michael Ledeen in National Review (please don&#8217;t stop reading) discusses terrorism as  a manifestation of man&#8217;s evil nature <br /><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/ledeen/ledeen200507190807.asp">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The evil can&#8217;t be explained by economic misery, or social alienation, or even by the doctrines adopted by the terrorists. The problem lies within us. â€œ</p>
<p>They are not misfits or sociopaths. They are people who find it fulfilling to kill us and destroy our society. As time passes, we will meet more and more of them. And, in the fullness of time, we will remember that Machiavelli warned us half a millennium ago that &#8220;man is more inclined to do evil than to do good,&#8221; and that the primary role of statesmen and other leaders is to contain the dark forces of human nature. Evil cannot be &#8220;fixed&#8221; by some social program or suitably energetic public-affairs strategy, or by &#8220;reaching out&#8221; to our misguided comrades. It must be dominated.</p>
<p>How do we contain the dark forces of  human nature?</p></blockquote>
<p>James Q Wilson in <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/html/14_1_what_makes_a_terrorist.html">What Makes a Terrorist</a> goes through the many recent terror-type movements from World War II Nazism to Communism, to abortion clinic bombings in an effort to understand and find an effective response to Islamic terror threat today.  Given that the al-Queda threat is comprised of many small groups that cross state boundaries, but united in their desire to bring Islamic rule to the West, supported by a milieu of supportive Islam society and resources.  Does it make sense to look at this as a small group problem?:</p>
<blockquote><p>While some suicide bombers have been the victims of blackmail, and some have been led to believe, wrongly, that the bombs in their trucks would go off after they had left them, my sense is that most recruitment today relies on small-group pressure and authoritative leaders. Anyone who took social-science courses in college will surely remember the famous experiments by Stanley Milgram. In the 1960s, Milgram, then a professor at Yale, recruited ordinary people through a newspaper ad offering them money to help in a project purporting to improve human memory. The improvement was to come from punishing a man who seemed unable to remember words read aloud to him. The man, a confederate of Milgram’s, was strapped in a chair with an electrode attached to his wrist. The punishment took the form of electric shocks administered by the experimental subjects from a control panel, showing a scale of shocks, from 15 to 450 volts. At the high end of the scale, clearly marked labels warned: “Danger—Severe Shock.” As the subject increased the imaginary voltage, the man who was supposed to have his memory improved screamed in pretended pain.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of the subjects Milgram had recruited went all the way to 450 volts. Only two things made a difference: the absence of a clear authority figure and the presence of rebellious peers. Without these modifications, almost everybody decided to “follow orders.” This study suggests to me that, rightly managed, a cohesive group with an authoritative leader can find people who will do almost anything.</p>
<p>Terrorist cells, whether they have heard of Stanley Milgram’s Obedience to Authority or not, understand these rules. They expose members to unchallenged authority figures and quickly weed out anyone who might be rebellious. They get rid of doubts by getting rid of the doubters.</p>
<p>This is not very different from how the military maintains morale under desperate conditions. Soldiers fight because their buddies fight. Heroism usually derives not from some deep heroic “urge” or from thoughts of Mom, apple pie, and national ideology, but from the example of others who are fighting.</p>
<p>Milgram did not train terrorists; he showed that one instinct Cynthia Ozick neglected—the instinct to be part of a team—can be as powerful as the one that tells us to be decent to other people. But suppose Milgram had been the leader of a terrorist sect and had recruited his obedient followers into his group; suppose teachings in the schools and mass propaganda supported his group. There is almost no limit to what he could have accomplished using such people. They might not have been clinically ill, but they would have been incorporated into a psychopathological movement.</p>
<p>The central fact about terrorists is not that they are deranged, but that they are not alone. Among Palestinians, they are recruited by Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, among others. In Singapore, their recruitment begins with attendance at religious schools. If ardent and compliant, they are drawn into Jemaah Islamiyah, where they associate with others like themselves. Being in the group gives each member a sense of special esteem and exclusivity, reinforced by the use of secrecy, code names, and specialized training. Then they are offered the chance to be martyrs if they die in a jihad. Everywhere, leaders strengthen the bombers’ commitment by isolating them in safe houses and by asking them to draft last testaments and make videotapes for their families, in which they say farewell.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is there a micro solution, rather than George Bush&#8217;s macro solution?</p>

<blockquote>Statistics are one way to tell the story of the approximately 1.4 million servicemen and women who’ve been to Iraq and Afghanistan. According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2004, 86 percent of soldiers in Iraq reported knowing someone who was seriously injured or killed there. Some 77 percent reported shooting at the enemy; 75 percent reported seeing women or children in imminent peril and being unable to help. Fifty-one percent reported handling or uncovering human remains; 28 percent were responsible for the death of a noncombatant. One in five Iraq veterans returns home seriously impaired by post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>Words are another way. Below are the stories of three veterans of this war, told in their voices, edited for flow and efficiency but otherwise unchanged. They bear out the statistics and suggest that even those who are not diagnosably impaired return burdened by experiences they can neither forget nor integrate into their postwar lives. They speak of the inadequacy of what the military calls reintegration counseling, of the immediacy of their worst memories, of their helplessness in battle, of the struggle to rejoin a society that seems unwilling or unable to comprehend the price of their service. Strangers to one another and to me, they nevertheless tried, sometimes through tears, to communicate what the intensity of an ambiguous war has done to them. One veteran, Sue Randolph, put it this way: “People walk up to me and say, ‘Thank you for your service.’ And I know they mean well, but I want to ask, ‘Do you know what you’re thanking me for?’” She, Rocky, and Michael Goss offer their stories here in the hope that citizens will begin to know.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their stories are in <a href="http://www.texasobserver.org/article.php?aid=2537">the article</a>.</p>

                                <p>I have to confess – I love the <em>Men in Black</em> movies.  So many really silly lines, so little time.  <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/meninblackii">Men in Black II</a> had agent K working at a post office where many of the employees just happened to be aliens.  Well, in Men Black III, we might see J &#038; K replaced with Jerry Bowyer and Neil Cavuto with one of the premises that the US health care system has been nationalized and is being run by aliens.  Or was that terrorists?  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/07/05/fox-news-universal-health-care-breeds-terrorists">Amanda</a> previews the script:</p>
<blockquote><p>A state run health care enterprise is bureaucratic, and I think the terrorists have shown over and over again, whether it’s dealing with INS or whether it’s dealing with airport security, they’re very good at gaming the system with bureaucracies. They’re very good at getting around bureaucracies.…And if one of your guys is a jihadist, if one of your doctors is spending all the time online reading Osama bin Laden fatwas, someone’s going to notice that. But the National Health Service is more like the post office, you know there’s a lot of anonymity, it’s easy to hide in the bureaucracy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Come to think of it – the producers of Men in Black are not this stupid.</p>

<blockquote><p>The day before Senate Watergate Committee minority counsel Fred Thompson made the inquiry that launched him into the national spotlight &#8211; asking an aide to President Nixon whether there was a White House taping system &#8211; he telephoned Nixon&#8217;s lawyer. Thompson tipped off the White House that the committee knew about the taping system and would be making the information public. In his all-but-forgotten Watergate memoir, &#8220;At That Point in Time,&#8221; Thompson said he acted with &#8220;no authority&#8221; in divulging the committee&#8217;s knowledge of the tapes, which provided the evidence that led to Nixon&#8217;s resignation. It was one of many Thompson leaks to the Nixon team, according to a former investigator for Democrats on the committee, Scott Armstrong , who remains upset at Thompson&#8217;s actions.  &#8220;Thompson was a mole for the White House,&#8221; Armstrong said in an interview. &#8220;Fred was working hammer and tong to defeat the investigation of finding out what happened to authorize Watergate and find out what the role of the president was.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the same fellow who thought Scooter Libby should not go to jail.  Go figure.</p>
