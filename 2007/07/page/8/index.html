<p>Whatever one thinks of the war in Iraq and recent progress that may or may not be occurring there, I don&#8217;t understand what is gained by writing something like this. Consider a simple thought experiment&#8230;.</p>
<p>1. What percentage of Iraqis not from Anbar would agree to spend two weeks in Anbar, with the proviso that they have to spend at least an hour or two a day walking around populated areas unescorted and unarmed, if offered the equivalent of one year&#8217;s median income for an Iraqi in exchange?<br />2. What percentage of Iraqis would agree to spend two weeks in NYC, with the proviso that they have to spend at least an hour or two a day walking around populated areas unescorted and unarmed, if offered the equivalent of one year&#8217;s median income for an Iraqi in exchange?<br />3.

What percentage of Americans not from NY would agree to spend two weeks in NYC, with the proviso that they have to spend at least an hour or two a day walking around populated areas unescorted and unarmed, if offered the equivalent of one year&#8217;s median income for an American in exchange?<br />5.

How much would it take to get the author of this piece to spend two weeks in Anbar, with the proviso he has to spend at least an hour or two a day walking around populated areas unescorted and unarmed?<br />8.

<p>I imagine the answers to the even number questions are significantly different from the answers to the odd number questions.</p>

                                <p>This post is on the number of jobs in the US economy over time. Just about every candidate for President promises he/she will create jobs, and just about every President that can boasts about job creation. So let’s see how they do. Data on job creation comes from <a href="http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm">BLS table Table LNS12000000</a>, Seasonal Employment Level. </p>
<p>OK. So what does the (annual average) seasonally adjusted civilian labor force look like? </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpyunrCZtcI/AAAAAAAAAco/uSVFAdXfxCk/s1600-h/Civilian+Employment,+Graph.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpyunrCZtcI/AAAAAAAAAco/uSVFAdXfxCk/s320/Civilian+Employment,+Graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpyusLCZtdI/AAAAAAAAAcw/Z4qq4FEV6hk/s1600-h/Civilian+Employment,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpyusLCZtdI/AAAAAAAAAcw/Z4qq4FEV6hk/s320/Civilian+Employment,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Fastest growth… Carter. Second fastest… Nixon/Ford. Then Reagan leading Clinton and JFK/LBJ by a smidge. Recall that the four administrations under whom <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">growth rate of real GDP per capita</a> was the fastest were in order JFK/LBJ, Clinton, Reagan, and Carter. A fast growing economy creates jobs, and jobs create a fast growing economy. More on this in a moment, but first a couple comments… First, a means test under the null hypothesis that the creation of jobs under Reps is the same as the creation of jobs under Dems is rejected at the 10% level (P value of 0.095). If the assumptions of the means test are acceptable under the circumstances, it would seem that job creation is more favorable under Dem administrations than under Rep administrations. Second, GW likes to talk about job creation since mid-2003. Well, the annualized rate of job creation between 2003 and 2006 is… 1.59%. Five administrations did better (during their entire term) than GW did under the cherry-picked term. </p>
<p>Back to: a fast growing economy creates jobs, and jobs create a fast growing economy. Or is that what we should conclude? Do more people getting jobs lead to growth? Does faster growth lead to more employment? Both? Neither?</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpyuxbCZteI/AAAAAAAAAc4/HCJ0wlleRpw/s1600-h/Civilian+Employment,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpyuxbCZteI/AAAAAAAAAc4/HCJ0wlleRpw/s320/Civilian+Employment,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The table indicates that the strongest correlation between the growth rate of the two series occurs in the same year. But… a quickly growing economy is also correlated positively (0.35) though not strongly with an increase in employment next year. The table seems to indicate that a fast growing economy is more likely to generate new jobs than new jobs are to generate a fast growing economy.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>I think from here the place to go is the employment population ratio. And I think that particularly statistic should be split into male versus female&#8230; the ratio of women who want jobs has changed over time as cultural norms have changed. I&#8217;ll try to write up a post on that some time soon.</p>

<p>Reader Dan adds to the WTO GATS trade agreements posts:</p>
<p>This site defines who is writing the US Trade Reps:  </p>
<blockquote><p>The World Trade Organization has set a July deadline for negotiating a text within the WTO’s Working Party on Domestic Regulation (WPDR). States are concerned because the negotiations could affect services that states traditionally provide or regulate such as public utilities, health facilities and licensing of professionals. The negotiations are authorized under GATS, the General Agreement on Trade in Services. </p>
<p>Letters to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) have come from three multi-state working groups (on services, energy policy and prescription drugs), oversight committees in Maine and California, the governors of Maine and Oregon, and a joint letter from attorneys general in 25 states. Two of the working groups submitted detailed case studies of how the WTO proposals could affect domestic regulation: one on coastal regulation of liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities and one on nursing qualifications.</p></blockquote>
<p>We learn more <a href="http://quebec.indymedia.org/en/node/13082?PHPSESSID=d360da731fc605a1b3ec4bac75d26216">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two other  sets of documents suggest that LOTIS and other corporate lobbyists appeared to have been astonishingly successful in getting Western governments to adopt their plans to radically expand the reach of the GATS treaty. A confidential memo dated March 19th obtained from inside the WTO&#8217;s Secretariat, written four weeks after the LOTIS meeting on the matter, indicates that European negotiators had accepted industry-favored amendments to GATS Article VI.4, known as the &#8220;necessity test.&#8221;</p>
<p>The necessity test requires nations to prove that their regulations &#8212; from pollution control to child labor laws &#8212; are not hidden impediments to trade. Industry wants the WTO to employ a necessity test similar to the one in the North America Free Trade Agreement which has worked to reverse local environmental rules. For example, Mexico has been forced to pay $17 million to an American corporation, Metalclad, for delaying the operation of the company&#8217;s toxic waste dump and processing plant. Local Mexican officials had attempted to block the plant&#8217;s operation on the grounds that it was built without a construction permit, and would not have received one, as the plant handling toxins was placed above the area&#8217;s drinking water supply.</p>
<p>According to the secret March 19 memo from the Working Party on Domestic Regulation, issued to WTO members by the organization&#8217;s Secretariat, European negotiators reached a private consensus to change the worldwide GATS agreement to include a much stronger form of the necessity test than found even in NAFTA. The Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico only requires that a nation&#8217;s regulations be &#8220;least trade restrictive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the GATS, as proposed in the memo, national laws and regulations would be struck down if they are &#8220;more burdensome than necessary&#8221; to business. The difference between the NAFTA language and the proposal for GATS is subtle, but the effect would be enormous. The language in the WTO memo effectively removes trade from the equation. Rather, a nation would have to adopt rules which are, in the memo&#8217;s words, the most &#8220;efficient&#8221; &#8212; that is to say those which carry the lowest cost to business.</p></blockquote>
<p>Freeing up some barriers to trade can work to benefit all, and bi-lateral agreements do include &#8216;necessity tests&#8217; to help smooth trade barriers away, many more than NAFTA.  WTO GATS Article V was a comparative advantage document between nations for economic integration, Article VII addressed de jure non-discrimintory issues, and VI.4 is to address domestic regulation through &#8216;necessity tests&#8217; that the nation must prove are &#8216;efficient&#8217; or not &#8216;more burdensome than necessary&#8217;.  The burden of proof is on the member, not the WTO.  Interesting approach as a grand experiment, but apparently, as always with so much money involved, is being gamed as well.  </p>
<p>Free is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>What is going to happen in globalization is well on the way, and promises many benefits, but is it sufficient to say the Hand will provide?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/13/AR2007071301709.html">Bill Kristol</a> does three things here: (1) suggests Bush’s tax cuts kept America’s economy from total meltdown; (2) credit Bush’s leadership for the fact that we have not had a second 9/11; and (3) totally gets silly on Iraq:</p>
<blockquote><p>And third, and most important, a war in Iraq that has been very difficult, but where &#8211; despite some confusion engendered by an almost meaningless &#8220;benchmark&#8221; report last week &#8211; we now seem to be on course to a successful outcome … First of all, we would have to compare the situation in Iraq now, with all its difficulties and all the administration&#8217;s mistakes, with what it would be if we hadn&#8217;t gone in. Saddam Hussein would be alive and in power and, I dare say, victorious, with the United States (and the United Nations ) by now having backed off sanctions and the no-fly zone. He might well have restarted his nuclear program, and his connections with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups would be intact or revived and even strengthened.  Still, that&#8217;s speculative, and the losses and costs of the war are real. Bush is a war president, and war presidents are judged by whether they win or lose their war. So to be a successful president, Bush has to win in Iraq.  Which I now think we can. Indeed, I think we will.</p></blockquote>
<p>I keep asking this – how do these neocons define win?  OK, we got rid of Saddam four years ago.  But we leave our troops there.  Kristol wants to do a counterfactual here – what would the place look like had we not toppled Saddam four years ago.  Number one – Al Qaeda would not be there.  In fact, we might have beaten Al Qaeda completely had we stayed focused on that threat and had we not given Osama bin Laden the best recruiting tool he could have ever wished for.  Number two – Iran would not be the dominant player in the region.  But now there are.  Of course, Kristol digs into his bag of rightwing lies to suggest Saddam was working with Osama bin Laden and had an active nuclear program.  But <a href="http://time-blog.com/swampland/2007/07/why_bush_will_be_a_winner_.html">Jay Carney</a> doesn’t even need to go there to mock the most recent stupidity from Kristol: </p>
<blockquote><p>Blowing past years of disastrous mismanagement of the war, Kristol says that Bush will ultimately be viewed a winner because &#8220;we now seem to be on course to a successful outcome&#8221; in Iraq. Now, even if you believed from the beginning that invading Iraq and toppling Saddam was the right thing to do. And even if you&#8217;ve never wavered from those convictions. And even if you argued last winter that more troops were necessary and that &#8220;surging&#8221; was the right thing to do. And even if you insist that there have been some modest &#8211; very modest &#8211; signs of improvement in a few (not many!) areas of Iraq in the past few months, wouldn&#8217;t you be deluding yourself, and testing the gullibility of your readers (given the cumulative experience of the past four-plus years, and all the mistaken predictions you and others had made about how well things were going in Iraq), if you suddenly decided that these few modest signs of improvement somehow proved that a) &#8220;we now seem to be on course to a successful outcome&#8221;, and b) Bush&#8217;s presidency will therefore be judged a success? What&#8217;s next? Promises that Iraqis will welcome new rotations of American G.I.&#8217;s with roses? Assurances that the next $200 billion in war costs will be paid with Iraqi oil revenue?</p></blockquote>
<p>Jay?  Jay?  What’s this $200 billion?  Bill Kristol predicted back in 2002 that the Iraq invasion would cost only 0.1% to 0.2% of one year’s worth of GDP.  That’s about $20 billion.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>In 2003 the tiny Caribbean nation of Antigua filed a case against the<br />US with the WTO. The case was about US initiatives to restrict online<br />gambling. These initiatives effectively barred all foreign run online<br />gambling companies from operating within the US.</p>
<p>In 2004, the WTO ruled for Antigua, and in 2005 an appeal by the US also ruled for the tiny nation. The US was given 11 months and 2 weeks to comply. To comply, the US had to repeal it&#8217;s laws allowing interstate gambling, specifically the Interstate Horseracing Act (and a similar one allowing gambling between 2 states as long as it is legal in both), or allow all Internet gambling. The US chose not to do either.</p>
<p>In 2006, The US passed a law, making it illegal for credit card companies to process payments for online gambling sites. It also started arresting directors of foreign online gambling companies who happened to set foot on US soil. This has served to strengthen Antigua&#8217;s hand in it&#8217;s WTO proceedings. It was also against the US GATS commitments in the WTO. These commitments were the same ones that the US pushed so hard for and spent years negotiating. They basically bring services into the purview of the WTO.</p>
<p>Because of the intransigence of the US, the WTO expanded it&#8217;s look into state gambling laws, which it had initially refused to consider, and found them to be also in violation of the GATS agreements. Things like state run lotteries, Indian casinos, and limits on numbers of casinos were now under threat. On top of that, Antigua is asking for $3.4 billion per year in sanctions until the US complies with the WTO order.</p>
<p>The US is trying to withdraw gambling from it&#8217;s GATS commitments. Initially, it tried to argue that it didn&#8217;t mean to include gambling, which didn&#8217;t do down very well with the other WTO members. From some sources, the US is still maintaining that it doesn&#8217;t have to do anything to withdraw, but from others it is using the GATS provided for mechanism for withdrawing obligations. The mechanism allows a member to withdraw it&#8217;s obligations in one area by opening up other services to other countries. Services like education have been mentioned.</p>
<p>Any government that says its interests are harmed by a change to pledges opening borders at the WTO is entitled to request negotiations with the US. Action by the EU, India and Japan have been started, with talks of Canada and Brazil also joining in.</p>
<p>Do we, as a country, really have any moral objections to gambling? No. It&#8217;s everywhere. Then why have we painted ourselves into this corner? What are we going to give up to protect gambling in the US? To the rest of the world, this is just another example of the US reneging on it&#8217;s commitments when it doesn&#8217;t suit US interests, and many are starting to wonder why they should live up to their commitments when they are counter to their own country&#8217;s interests.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hurting in opinion polls and haunted by charges of lavish personal spending, Democrat John Edwards took his presidential campaign on Monday to some of the most impoverished parts of the country.  With America&#8217;s poor the crux of his campaign, the former vice presidential candidate launched an eight-state tour in New Orleans, a city that exposed U.S. poverty to a global audience following Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. His focus on poverty challenges his top Democratic rivals, Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and enables Edwards to present himself as a leader with a cause bigger than his own ambition, analysts said.  &#8220;This is not a political strategy. This is a huge moral issue facing America&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed it is.  Critics of Edwards might legitimately ask the question as to what government policy could do to address the poverty problem.  That is a fair question – and let’s have that debate.</p>

                                <p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/business/15gilded.html?ex=1342152000&#038;en=b93e1c0193b4182c&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">NY Times </a>piece is making a comparison to yesteryears when those mansions in Newport, RI were built. It starts with Sanford I. Weil of Citigroup and how he compares to Andrew Carnegie.</p>
<p>First, how does this period compare: <br />
<blockquote>Only twice before over the last century has 5 percent of the national income gone to families in the upper one-one-hundredth of a percent of the income distribution — currently, the almost 15,000 families with incomes of $9.5 million or more a year, according to an analysis of tax returns by the economists Emmanuel Saez at the University of California, Berkeley  and Thomas Piketty at the Paris School of Economics. (I have posted from their data in the past.) Such concentration at the very top occurred in 1915 and 1916, as the Gilded Age was ending, and again briefly in the late 1920s, before the stock market crash.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr Weil view:<br />
<blockquote>“I once thought how lucky the Carnegies and the Rockefellers were because they made their money before there was an income tax,” “I want to give away my money rather than have somebody take it away,”</p></blockquote>
<p>We have Mr. Kenneth C. Griffin, who received more than $1 billion last year as chairman of a hedge fund, the Citadel Investment Group, declared:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The money is a byproduct of a passionate endeavor.”<br />“We have helped to create real social value in the U.S. economy,” he said. “We have invested money in countless companies over the years and they have helped countless people.” “The income distribution has to stand,” Mr. Griffin said, adding that by trying to alter it with a more progressive income tax, “you end up in problematic circumstances. In the current world, there will be people who will move from one tax area to another. I am proud to be an American. But if the tax became too high, as a matter of principle I would not be working this hard.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such positions are summed up with:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Carnegie made it abundantly clear that the centerpiece of his gospel of wealth philosophy was that individuals do not create wealth by themselves,” said David Nasaw, a historian at City University of New York. and the author of “Andrew Carnegie” (Penguin Press). “The creator of wealth in his view was the community, and individuals like himself were trustees of that wealth.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Really?  They are the Trustees?</p>
<p>Can it be anymore egocentric? Why yes they can:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lew Frankfort, chairman and chief executive of Coach the manufacturer and retailer of trendy upscale handbags, who was among the nation’s highest paid chief executives last year, recaps the argument. “The professional class that developed in business in the ’50s and ’60s,” he said, “was able as America grew at very steady rates to become industry leaders and move their organizations forward in most categories: steel, autos, housing, roads.”</p>
<p>That changed with the arrival of “the technological age,” in Mr. Frankfort’s view. Innovation became a requirement, in addition to good management skills — and innovation has played a role in Coach’s marketing success. “To be successful,” Mr. Frankfort said, “you now needed vision, lateral thinking, courage and an ability to see things, not the way they were but how they might be.” (Like this was not needed in the past?) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please note, Mr. Frankfort is not emphasizing the manufacturing, he is emphasizing the marketing. </p>
<p>What would be the “problematic circumstances” of being more progressive in the tax structure? Why do they not want to pay the help that they acknowledged got them where they are? Even in the good old days of Carnegie, paying the help was not considered a charitable thing to do.</p>
<p>I have posted that things have changed. We make money differently today. The article notes: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 outlawed the mix, blaming conflicts of interest inherent in such a combination for helping to bring on the 1929 crash and the Depression. The pen displayed in Mr. Weill’s hallway is one of those Mr. Clinton used to revoke Glass-Steagall in 1999. He did so partly to accommodate the newly formed Citigroup, whose heft was necessary, Mr. Weill said, if the United States was to be a powerhouse in global financial markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article does offer counter opinions to this self aggrandizement. I&#8217;ll leave it to you to read the rest except for this which I think sums up the counter opinion (in a more polite manor than I would have): </p>
<blockquote><p>“I don’t see a relationship between the extremes of income now and the performance of the economy,” Paul A. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve Board chairman, said in an interview, challenging the contentions of the very rich that they are, more than others, the driving force of a robust economy. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Going through the presidential candidates&#8217; financial reports, it&#8217;s interesting to see how top Democrats have controlled their spending — fiscal restraint! — while some top Republicans are either living beyond their means or are operating close to the edge. With the exception of Rudy Giuliani, it appears that the Republicans are not as good as Democrats at managing their money.</p>
<p>As of the end of the second quarter of 2007, Hillary Clinton took in $27 million, spent $12 million, and has $45 million in cash on hand, with a total debt of $3 million. Barack Obama took in $33 million, spent $16 million, and has $36 million in cash on hand and a total debt of $922,000. John Edwards took in $9 million, spent $6.3 million, and has $13.3 million in cash on hand with a total debt of $0.</p>
<p>We all know John McCain&#8217;s money problems. But Mitt Romney is burning money at a rate very close to 100 percent. Romney took in $21 million, spent $20.5 million, and has $12 million in cash on hand, with a total debt of $9 million. That debt, of course, represents Romney&#8217;s personal cash infusions into the campaign, without which he would have run a big deficit in the second quarter and would have ended the period with about $3 million in cash on hand. Giuliani took in $17.5 million, spent $11 million and has $18 million in cash on hand with a total debt of $0.</p></blockquote>
<p>York is clearly surprised that Rep candidates don&#8217;t seem to be fiscally responsible relative to Dem candidates.

                            </p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post is on the Civilian Labor Force level and how it changed over time. I will be using data from the BLS, in particular <a href="http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm">Table LNS11000000</a>. Because the data is produced monthly, I will be looking at the data for January of each year, as January is the month in which a President takes (and leaves) office.</p>
<p>A few comments before I go on. I recognize that the Civilian Labor Force is not especially affected by actions of the President, but I feel its important to look at this series because it may help explain some of the difference in economic performance between Presidents. For instance, one would assume that real GDP per capita might grow more quickly as the Civilian Labor force grows more quickly, in part because presumably that increases the ratio of potential workers in the economy, and in part because of network effects. </p>
<p>I also hasten to add… as pointed out by <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/1127154466917452793/#648637">reader I Kitov</a> on another thread, there are problems with this series. In particular, “the BLS used postcensal estimates before 2000 and intercensal estimates after 2000.” Now, I’m going to use this data anyway because I want to look at the employment to population ratio in a follow-up post, and the employment rate developed by the BLS is based in part on the same population estimates and I want to be able to look at the two series (civilian labor force and employment to population) together. One does what one can…</p>
<p>OK. So what does the seasonally adjusted civilian labor force look like? </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rprg8LCZtZI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/95RIDMUVAMg/s1600-h/civilian+labor+force+graph.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rprg8LCZtZI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/95RIDMUVAMg/s320/civilian+labor+force+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Eyeballing, it looks pretty steady. But is it? Here’s a summary…</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RptekbCZtbI/AAAAAAAAAcg/Y_onVoiL9uk/s1600-h/civilian+labor+force+table.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RptekbCZtbI/AAAAAAAAAcg/Y_onVoiL9uk/s320/civilian+labor+force+table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The slowest growth rate of the civilian force… under GHW. Second fastest under GW. Third under Ike. In terms of growth rate of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">growth rate of real GDP per capita</a>, these three came out last, third last, and second last of all administrations beginning in 1952. So far, what we expect. But Carter and Reagan at the top of the Civilian Labor Force growth rates? they were 4 and 3 in terms of real GDP per capita. </p>
<p>I Kitov suggests in comments that perhaps the yearly average makes more sense&#8230; a one month figure could be heavily skewed by error. Table 2 below looks at that. (Hence, for Carter, the growth rate is the change from 1976, the year before he took office, to 1980, his last year in office.)</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RptegLCZtaI/AAAAAAAAAcY/PugbQaM_Ucc/s1600-h/civilian+labor+force+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RptegLCZtaI/AAAAAAAAAcY/PugbQaM_Ucc/s320/civilian+labor+force+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Offhand, results are even less suggestive of a relationship between a change in the number of civilian workers and a change in real GDP per capita. </p>
<p>FWIW, the correlation between the % change in real GDP per capita and the % change in the average size of the civilian labor force is only 0.2. And between % change in the average size of the civilian labor force and next year&#8217;s % change in real GDP, its -.11. (i.e., negative 011)</p>
<p>Clearly something is not right. My guess… it’s the folks that are employed, and the ratio of the employed to the total population that matter. I’ll try to post on these topics soon.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Update.</p>
<p>My Friday post seemed to be riddled with errors. Fortunately, readers caught those errors, and I made changes. Whatever the problem was Friday, there seems to be a residual of it still here today&#8230; I Kitov points out the ranking on the summary table as originally posted was misleading, and that led to changes in the verbage as well. Hopefully I&#8217;m now over these mistakes, or I have to spend a bit more time editing. Apologies.</p>
