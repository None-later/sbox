<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/21/news/companies/bear_stearns/index.htm"> The Wall Street Journal</a> reported: </p>
<blockquote><p>The two funds suffered double-digit losses through April after making bad bets on securities backed by subprime loans, according to Reuters. The subprime market, which gives home loans to borrowers with weak credit, has been roiled by rising defaults.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns has also been negotiating with JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and other creditors in an attempt to restructure the hedge funds. Other big lenders include Goldman Sachs (Charts, Fortune 500) and Bank of America (Charts, Fortune 500)&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/bear-stearns-hedge-fund-liquidates/story.aspx?guid=%7B326ABF86-C1C5-4B4E-B544-B8DCDD0F65E4%7D">MARKET WATCH</a> indicates:</p>
<blockquote><p>Losses suffered by the Bear Stearns fund weren&#8217;t surprising because the investment bank has aggressively expanded in all parts of the mortgage market, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bear has been among the most aggressive players in every aspect of this market &#8211; from origination to servicing mortgages and through to the trading of these securities,&#8221; he explained. </p>
<p>Bear Stearns didn&#8217;t invest much of its own capital in the fund and its exposure is relatively small, so the problems shouldn&#8217;t have any material impact on future results, Sam Molinaro, chief financial officer of Bear Stearns, said according to a transcript of a Thursday conference call.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not such a bad deal for Bear Stearns COS, having only two sequestered funds in trouble.  It is important to follow gainers and losers with any economic model, flawed or not.  Bear Stearns was always well protected.  Will keep you posted.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>There have been two impeachments of the President – both by radical Republican Congresses.  In both cases, the 1868 impeachment of Andrew Johnson and the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton – the Senate failed to sustain the allegations.  And for good reason – both instances represented brazen partisan politics.  </p>
<p>There have been two Presidents whose behavior was so outrageous that they should have been impeached.  One is the current President who will likely run out the clock.  Besides, some in the press including David Broder strike me as carrying the water for this Machiavellian disaster we somehow elected twice.  The other, of course, was Richard Nixon who had to resign in 1974 because of what we now call the Watergate scandal.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/the-highest-bro.html">Brad DeLong</a> reminds us of what David Broder wrote way back then.  An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the House votes to impeach Mr. Nixon, there would be little need to revise the widespread predictions of significant Democratic gains in the November election. In truth, those predictions are premised on an unfavorable verdict against the President.  But suppose the House goes the other way? Suppose there are few Republican defections and that enough Democrats cross the line to exonerate Mr. Nixon of every charge leveled against him by the Judiciary Committee in its expected bill of impeachment? Legally, that would be the end of the matter. The cloud over Mr. Nixon&#8217;s future would disappear and he could go back to being a full-time President. Congress could go back to legislating. Messrs. Doar, Jenner, and St. Clair could return to their firms. But politically, the fireworks would just be starting, for anyone can see that a drama as great as Watergate itself would begin no more than 24 hours after the House refused to vote impeachment. The first reaction would probably be a wave of recriminations within the House itself &#8211; with the anti-impeachment majority lashing out against the Judiciary Committee members for spending $1.5 million and uncounted thousands of manhours to produde an indictment so weak that the House itself would not sustain it. But that reaction would be a passing ripple compared to the tidal wave of public sentiment that would sweep over the Congress if the House voted against impeachment. Mr. Nixon&#8217;s spokesmen have already made the accusation that the impeachment investigation ordered by the Democratic leadership last October is nothing but a partisan assault on the integrity of the presidential office. If the Judiciary Committee were repudiated by a majority of the 248 Democrats and 187 Republicans in the House &#8211; no matter in what proportions &#8211; the White House charge would surely have been proven to the public&#8217;s satisfaction. The President&#8217;s supporters in the country would cry vengeance against a Congress which spent the better part of two years not dealing with energy or inflation but harassing the President for no purpose. The President&#8217;s critics would no doubt take a vote against impeachment as a final proof of the craven cowardice of congressmen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Tricky Dick’s men tried to claim Watergate was just a political stunt.  But by July 10, 1974 – only those who were truly deaf, dumb, and blind had any doubt that Nixon was presiding over his own Machiavellian regime and was personally involved with the Watergate cover-up.  Was a young David Broder really this stupid?  Or was he another one of the Nixon water carriers?  Brad’s point is well taken:</p>
<blockquote><p>David Broder: He came to Washington. He trashed the place. And it wasn&#8217;t his place. It was never his place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe – but the David Broders of the press seemed to have multiplied over the past 30 plus years.</p>

<blockquote><p>President Bush has promised to veto seven Democratic spending bills &#8211; including the Labor-HHS-Education bill &#8211; and sign five others, on the grounds that he wants to rein in spending. So, CBPP checked this out and found that the seven bills Bush is likely to veto will actually cost less, when you adjust for inflation and population growth, than they did in 2002-06, when Republicans ran Congress. And the five bills he&#8217;s planning on signing into law will actually cost more.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/7-18-07bud.htm">CBPP </a> provides the details.  Check it out and compare to the BS that emanates from the White House.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=5048766">Josh Marshall</a>, <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/localPolitics/view.bg?articleid=1012402">this story</a> in the Boston Herald:</p>
<blockquote><p>In an apparent violation of the law, a controversial aide to ex-Gov. Mitt Romney created phony law enforcement badges that he and other staffers used on the campaign trail to strong-arm reporters, avoid paying tolls and trick security guards into giving them immediate access to campaign venues, sources told the Herald. </p>
<p>The bogus badges were part of the bizarre security tactics allegedly employed by Jay Garrity, the director of operations for Romney who is under investigation for impersonating a law enforcement officer in two states. Garrity is on a leave of absence from the campaign while the probe is ongoing.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“They (the aides) knew the badges were fake and probably illegal,” said a presidential campaign source who asked for anonymity because the story could damage the individual’s career. “But they went along with it because Jay (Garrity) pushed it on them.” </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Two additional sources confirmed that the badges &#8211; described as bright silver plates with a state seal attached &#8211; were first created and used by Garrity while Romney was still governor. Under state law, it is illegal to use a badge without authority, an offense that carries a fine of not more than $50. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Garrity referred all questions to the Romney campaign. </p>
<p>The campaign source said the badges were used extensively by Garrity and staffers on Romney’s advance team, which is responsible for coordinating events for his presidential campaign. </p>
<p>Sometimes, the source said, a staffer would use a badge for crowd control to restrict access to Romney. Other times, they were flashed to gain quick access to emergency exits and back hallways at campaign venues. In at least one instance, a staffer used a badge to go through a Massachusetts Turnpike toll booth without paying, the source said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to leave aside snide remarks about the Romney campaign and the people he employs and focus on a different question&#8230; it isn&#8217;t all that rare for people with some degree of power to get caught engaging in acts that are, well, stupid. </p>
<p>Possible reasons I can see include some combination of:<br />1. Power corrupts<br />2. These people were corrupt to start with, and power gives them the opportunity to act on their corrupt impulses.<br />3. The fact that these people have power means their corruption is more likely to hit the public eye if they&#8217;re caught.<br />4. The fact that these people have power means their corruption is less likely to have consequences if they&#8217;re caught, so its a rational thing to be more corrupt.</p>
<p>Possibility 4 is particularly disturbing to me.</p>
<p>So, which is it? Are there other possibilities I&#8217;m missing?</p>

                                <p>Bruce Bartlett was kind enough to alert us to <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/07/the_optional_flat_tax_1.html">this post</a> from Senator Brownback:</p>
<blockquote><p>I propose an optional flat tax that would exist alongside the current code. This approach does not gore any of the tax code&#8217;s sacred cows and it could actually be enacted into law. An optional flat tax would generate economic growth and be vastly more transparent, simple and family &#8211; friendly than the current code &#8230; To account for the complicated credits and deductions in the current system, the optional flat tax would offer a generous personal income exclusion indexed for inflation. For individual tax filers, their first $20,000 of income would be excluded from taxation. For joint, married tax filers, their first $40,000 of income would be excluded. Looking at the work of many tax experts, I expect the optional flat tax rate would be in the range of 15 to 20 percent.  The flat tax would partially pay for itself by boosting GDP growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bruce wasn’t endorsing this crackpot idea but rather expressing his frustration with the dishonesty of those who push it.  It certainly would not be fiscally neutral as only those who would pay less in taxes would adopt it.  And this notion that a top marginal rate equal to 20 percent would not lead to a huge revenue drain is just stupid.  Brownback claims that this would be a move to tax simplification, which is beyond absurd as one would have to calculate one’s tax under both systems to figure out which one to adopt.  Let me just add the following – Brownback’s claim that a tax rate cut would lead to faster GDP growth is idiotic.  After all, giving people their money back so they can consume more translates into lower national savings. The post is the same old free lunch BS we are hearing from most of the GOP Presidential candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110006227">Stephen Moore</a> discussed this crackpot idea in early 2005:</p>
<blockquote><p>Former senators Connie Mack of Florida and John Breaux of Louisiana, the chairmen of President Bush&#8217;s new tax reform panel, have been granted a historic opportunity to dramatically overhaul our economically debilitating federal tax system. The surest way for the tax panel to crack through the political gridlock that has paralyzed this issue for decades would be to endorse the Freedom to Choose Flat Tax. This is an idea that I first introduced in The Wall Street Journal eight years ago &#8211; to an extraordinarily enthusiastic reception.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moore claims this additional layer of complexity (having to do your taxes two ways) would somehow lower compliance costs by over $110 billion per year.  If this unsupported claim were not bad enough, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>On top of that, economist Dale Jorgenson of Harvard estimated several years ago that if the U.S. tax code were replaced with some kind of flat and simple consumption tax, the economy would grow about 10% faster. This would mean that instead of the economy growing at 4% a year, it could grow at almost 4.5% a year, and in that case the nation could expand its way out of many of its thorniest problems, such as low wage-rate growth, stubbornly high poverty rates, the $413 billion budget deficit, and the decline in jobs in the manufacturing sector.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ten percent faster versus having a growth rate that was about 1.1 times the usual growth rate.  Nice bait and switch language.  But the economy does not grow at an average rate of 4% and the free lunch Brownback proposal is not going to increase long-term growth rates.  So let’s call this free lunch lies what they are – lies.  It would seem that Mr. Moore has been pushing this nutty idea for the last decade with Bruce Bartlett rightfully criticizing it the whole time.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been trying to work out why US Sharemarkets are booming while the US Dollar is simultaneously tanking &#8211; and I have this theory that it may be because people are fleeing from the debt (bond) markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>I encourage you to read the rest of the piece. </p>
<p>That said, I don&#8217;t disagree with One Salient Oversight often, but I think there&#8217;s a simpler explanation which doesn&#8217;t occur immediately to people who are used to stable countries, even fictional stable countries. Regular readers know I was born in the US, but grew up in South America in the 1970s and 1980s, and it colors my thought process to this day. Hyperinflation, currency devaluations, a foreign tourist walking a rat on a leash on Copacabana beach, I&#8217;ve seen it all. And while the currency devalues, prices, which are nominal rise. And that includes the price of stocks. </p>
<p>If the dollar continues to devalue, the nominal price of the stock market will continue to rise, but in devalued currency. And that&#8217;s not a good thing, no matter how Lawrence Kudlow tries to spin it.</p>

<p>The entire Army is to learn about brain, stress disorders according to <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_6398855?source=rss">this article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>By The Associated Press<br />Article Last Updated: 07/17/2007 09:45:32 PM MDT<br />Washington &#8211; The Army is launching an education program to teach 1 million soldiers how to recognize symptoms of brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder, the two signature injuries of the Iraq war. </p>
<p>The program aims to encourage troops to get treatment &#8211; and to help erase the stigma of doing so, Army officials said Tuesday. </p>
<p>Beginning next week, a program will begin to educate the entire Army within 90 days, whether at home or overseas, and including active military, the Army Reserves and the Army National Guard. </p>
<p>Everyone is to receive a one- hour briefing on brain injuries and stress, in which teachers will be equipped with videos, slides and a list of expected questions and answers. </p>
<p>It will be done through a rarely used &#8220;chain teach&#8221; program, that is, the subject is taught to leaders, who then teach it to soldiers, continuing down through the Army&#8217;s chain of command. </p>
<p>The program is one of many being taken by the Army and the Department of Defense to try to keep up with a rising number of patients who have overwhelmed the system. </p>
<p>Roadside bombs are the top killer in Iraq and also responsible for brain injuries ranging from mild concussions up to severe trauma. </p>
<p>Exposure to combat, especially for long and repeated tours, also has caused increasing stress and mental health problems among soldiers. </p>
<p>Officials say that as much as 20 percent of troops are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with stress symptoms or brain injury.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting response from the Army and DoD concerning this issue.  Not having seen the one hour presentation, I will not comment yet.  I assume this is a first response.  I also assume it is affecting the way soldiers are performing.  How such information helps stigma and career paths remains to be seen, of course, but at least the issue will be open to the general public as well.</p>
<p>How the issue helps with treatment and overwhelming the care system also remains to be seen, because the budget costs have not been resolved to date.  For today, I will smile. </p>

<p>Greenspan and Bernanke laud the flexibility of the American labor market, so let&#8217;s try policies that increase labor flexibility.</p>
<p>How about outlawing non-compete clauses, and other labor-stifling contractual agreements? Like the one that says &#8220;if you leave the company, you can&#8217;t contact your ex-coworkers for X years for the purpose of employing them at your new company.&#8221; </p>
<p>After all, CEOs seem to profit quite handsomely from their high-level contacts and interlocking boards; why should the frontline grunts be barred from profiting from their contacts?</p>
<p>These contracts stifle the free market for labor and seek to protect companies from competition. Since open competition is what the market is all about, our friends on the right should greet these changes with open arms, no? </p>
<p>I suspect, however, that in actual practice, increasing competition is pretty low on the corporate priority list. 🙂</p>

<blockquote><p>We never argued that he played a role 9/11; political opponents manufactured the claim to question the president&#8217;s integrity.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the rest of this is either brazen dishonesty or unbelievable optimism:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most astonishing argument is the claim the United States (or the Bush administration) is responsible for this terror wave. Terrorists are responsible for terror, period.  The al-Qaeda of 2001 no longer exists. We&#8217;ve killed or captured two-thirds of its senior leadership. The new National Intelligence Estimate says our nation has become a tougher target. That&#8217;s because our government has adopted aggressive measures to gather intelligence, protect Americans and strike enemies before they can strike us.  Al-Qaeda doesn&#8217;t have the strength it had six years ago, but it remains committed to killing Americans. It also wants to find a safe haven, as it had in Afghanistan. It sees Iraq as its best hope.</p></blockquote>
<p>Osama bin Laden is somewhere near the Afghan/Paki border but Tony Snow says these thugs no longer exist.  Yippie!  We won!  Oh wait – Al Qaeda is gaining strength but that decision to invade on March 19, 2003 had nothing to do with Al Qaeda’s ability to gain new recruits.  Wow – I have had this wrong all along.  Thanks to Tony Snow for setting me straight!</p>

<blockquote><p>Former CIA operative Valerie Plame lost a lawsuit Thursday that demanded money from Bush administration officials whom she blamed for leaking her agency identity … U.S. District Judge John D. Bates dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds and said he would not express an opinion on the constitutional arguments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dismissed on a technicality and not the merits.  But where have we hear about this John D. Bates before?  <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_02/12.11A.bates-cheney.htm">Oh yea</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a case involving bedrock constitutional issues, a federal judge today threw out a lawsuit brought by an agency of Congress against Vice President Dick Cheney over the formulation of the administration&#8217;s energy policy. Judge John D. Bates of Federal District Court found that Comptroller General David M. Walker, the head of the General Accounting Office, did not have sufficient standing to sue the vice president. Mr. Walker had asked the judge to order the White House to reveal the identities of industry executives who helped the administration develop its energy policy last year. In declining to do so, and in dismissing Mr. Walker&#8217;s suit, Judge Bates said that granting the G.A.O. chief&#8217;s request &#8220;would fly in the face of the restricted role of the federal courts under the Constitution.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Again – the Federal court is not the right venue for what appears to be a Federal case.  What is it with this judge?  Hat tip to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/07/19/breaking-judge-dismisses-plames-civil-suit">Think Progress</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/07/19/278430.aspx">Robert Novak</a> defends his outing of Valerie Plame:</p>
<blockquote><p>Novak contends in his book that Plame Wilson was “not now and never would be again” a covert agent. But he admits that CIA spokesman Bill Harlow asked him “to keep Mrs. Wilson’s CIA connection out of my column” and that the “revelation of her name might cause unspecified ‘difficulties’ if she traveled abroad.” He inferred based on his “experience with CIA jargon” that Plame “at one time had been engaged in covert activities abroad but was not now and never would be again.” He says he “learned much later” she had already been outed by a Soviet spy, “which had ended her career as a covert agent long before I wrote about her.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Novak’s “defense” is based on statements that are clearly not true.  OK, Novak’s rightwing buddies love to tell these lies.  But repeating someone else’s lie does not change the fact that it is a lie.</p>
