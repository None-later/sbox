                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19850951">Tim Russert</a> interviewed Senator Feingold on Meet the Press today.  Senator Feingold was excellent as usual.  After this interview, he brought on Bob Woodward (sometimes a Bush water carrier) balanced but notable liberals Stephen Hayes and David Brooks (OK, the latter two are full time Bush water carriers).  Where to begin – oh wait, I gave it away as I want to go straight to what irked <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/015681.php">Steve Benen</a> (Hayes babbling):</p>
<blockquote><p>I think one of the things we saw this week, and this, this speaks directly to what the vice president told me, is with this &#8211; the release of this NIE we saw a shift in thinking. I think for a long time administration critics had begun to make the argument that really this al-Qaeda threat is overblown, that they misled us into the war in Iraq, they&#8217;re misleading us about the seriousness of the threat from al-Qaeda. And I think what the NIE does, even though in some ways it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s very critical of the administration, is it strengthens the basic case that the administration has been making that al-Qaeda remains a serious threat.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This threw Steve off but he recovered:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have no idea what Hayes is talking about. Or, more precisely, Hayes has no idea what he&#8217;s talking about. Where are these mysterious White House &#8220;critics&#8221; who&#8217;ve been arguing that the al Qaeda threat is &#8220;overblown&#8221;? Seriously, name some prominent Bush detractors who have argued this, in Hayes&#8217; words, &#8220;for a long time.&#8221; I&#8217;m relatively clued into Democratic talking points and I can&#8217;t recall any Democrat or left-leaning political figure ever making this argument in any forum, in any context. Hayes appears to have simply made it up in the hopes of making the NIE appear more favorable for his White House allies. Which segues to the other problem: the NIE doesn&#8217;t strengthen the Bush&#8217;s gang&#8217;s &#8220;basic case&#8221; at all. The White House has said, repeatedly, that thanks to the president&#8217;s leadership, we&#8217;ve destroyed al Qaeda&#8217;s leadership and have the terrorist network on the run. The NIE, in stark contrast, shows the opposite and vindicates what White House critics have been arguing for years. While the president&#8217;s policies have been failing in Iraq, al Qaeda is rebuilding, recruiting, and refilling its coffers &#8211; in large part because of the president&#8217;s failed policies in Iraq. And yet there was Hayes, on national television, making an argument that was clearly false, predicated on straw men and imaginary progress. The mind reels.</p></blockquote>
<p>But me thinks Mr. Hayes was trying to say we Democrats never got the point that we had to toss Saddam Hussein in order to stop Osama bin Laden.  What?  What? Reality says that invading Iraq on 3/19/2003 actually was a major boost to Al Qaeda?  Of course, Hayes realized he could get away with this dishonesty after listening to Woodward being just stupid, nothing, or whatever followed by the following from David Brooks: </p>
<blockquote><p>I would still think he thinks the fundamentals are, are true, that in the long run he’ll be proved right, and that’s kind of remarkable.  I think a lot of us who supported the war, the failures of the war have set off a whole cascade of philosophical thinking.  “Maybe in the Arab world they’re not culturally ready for democracy.  Maybe we don’t have the power to do it, we just don’t have the competency as a government.” It’s created a whole set of serious debates.  It doesn’t seem to have created that in the president’s mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm – the reason we invaded Iraq was to establish a democracy at the point of a gun?  All that 2002 talk about WMDs and Saddam working with Osama bin Laden was something that I just dreamed?  What a load of horseshit?  With all due respect to Senator Feingold – how in hell do you lower yourself to appear on a show run by Tim Russert?  </p>
<p>And the mystery remains why NBC still considers its Sunday mornings owned by Faux News.  Fire Tim Russert, fire him now!</p>

<p><big>Health Care in America 2006 Survey</big></p>
<p><a href="http://www.kff.org/kaiserpolls/upload/7572.pdf">This</a> ABC News/Kaiser Family Foundation/USA Today survey has a lot of interesting information about the public (who incidentally vote) opinion of the Health Care situation in this country. There is a lot of &#8220;survey support&#8221; for some form of Universal Health Care for those supporters here.</p>
<p>But the most telling survey result to me is the juxtoposition of Chart 2 &#8220;How Satisfied are you with each of the following?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqPeZUPDHZI/AAAAAAAAAd4/AiW9jh6K8kg/s1600-h/Sammy%27s+Healthcare+Table.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqPeZUPDHZI/AAAAAAAAAd4/AiW9jh6K8kg/s320/Sammy%27s+Healthcare+Table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Note from cactus&#8230; I took the liberty of modifying Sammy&#8217;s post slightly by putting the results in table form.)</p>
<p>(This depicts a system that is delivering high quality )</p>
<p>With Chart 1 &#8220;Are you satisfied/dissatisfied with&#8230;.</p>
<p>Total cost of health care 18% Satisfied<br />Quality of health care in this country 44% Satisfied </p>
<p>In other words when asked about their <em>own personal health care experience</em> with quality (89% satisfied) and cost (57% satisfied) they are pretty strongly positive, compared to when asked about their <em>perceptions of other peoples health care</em> with quality (44% satisfied) and cost (18% satisfied).</p>
<p>Why the disconnect? Could it be that these perceptions are being created through the liberal and bad news-oriented media, and by politicians seeking to get votes by exaggerating a problem? Are we being conned into turning over our health system to the government?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Regular readers know I disagree with Sammy on a lot of issues. I&#8217;ll post my response in comments.</p>

                                <p>Get this. The problem is that globalization is being threatened, all that good could be lost. The solution; Social Security.</p>
<p>In the July/August issue of Foreign Affairs (published by the Council of Foreign Relations) is an article: <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070701faessay86403-p50/kenneth-f-scheve-matthew-j-slaughter/a-new-deal-for-globalization.html">A New Deal for Globalization </a>by Kenneth F. Scheve is Professor of Political Science at Yale University. Matthew J. Slaughter is Professor of Economics at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.<br />Seems some people somewhere are getting concerned that their pet project might be getting derailed.<br />
<blockquote>“<strong>Advocates of engagement with the world economy are now warning of a protectionist drift in public policy.</strong> This drift is commonly blamed on narrow industry concerns or a failure to explain globalization&#8217;s benefits or the war on terrorism. These explanations miss a more basic point: U.S. policy is becoming more protectionist because the American public is becoming more protectionist, and this shift in attitudes is a result of stagnant or falling incomes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors say they don&#8217;t know why the incomes are falling, that there are no clear answers:<br />
<blockquote>“Over the last several years, a striking new feature of the U.S. economy has emerged: real income growth has been extremely skewed, with relatively few high earners doing well while incomes for most workers have stagnated or, in many cases, fallen. Just what mix of forces is behind this trend is not yet clear, but regardless, the numbers are stark.”</p></blockquote>
<p>First &#8212; “new feature”? Did they not read about the early years of the rise of the industrialists and the division in income way back when? Or is it that they as others took for granted that those making the money via globalizing their operations were going to be nice to those who worked for them at home and share the spoils via wages. Now that would have been a “new feature”. Being nice that is. I know, maybe they just thought everyone could and would outsource their own labor.</p>
<p>Actually, they do know about the old days:</p>
<blockquote><p>“By some measures, inequality in the United States is greater today than at any time since the 1920s.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s the solution to rising protectionism talk? Well, first what is not going to work (read carefully all you who think it&#8217;s just a matter of the populace getting off their intellectually lazy butts):</p>
<blockquote><p>“They must also recognize that the two most commonly proposed responses &#8212; more investment in education and more trade adjustment assistance for dislocated workers &#8212; are nowhere near adequate. Significant payoffs from educational investment will take decades to be realized, and trade adjustment assistance is too small and too narrowly targeted on specific industries to have much effect.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, go to school, get a job is not it. Darn! The solution envelop please, (I&#8217;m so nervous):</p>
<blockquote><p>“The best way to avert the rise in protectionism is by instituting a New Deal for globalization &#8212; one that links engagement with the world economy to a substantial redistribution of income. In the United States, that would mean adopting a fundamentally more progressive federal tax system.”</p></blockquote>
<p>WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!! REDISTRIBUTION?</p>
<blockquote><p>“The notion of more aggressively redistributing income may sound radical, but ensuring that most American workers are benefiting is the best way of saving globalization from a protectionist backlash.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And they said they didn&#8217;t know why “income growth had been extremely skewed.” Well, if they didn&#8217;t know, then how is it they are channeling what was proposed before? They are even referring to it in it&#8217;s historically correct name: New Deal.</p>
<p>The article is very basic thinking and made me wonder why does it take 2 professors writing for 6 pages to state what I was taught under the lesson of morals: that is to share and share alike,<br />And then under the lesson of civics: that is social commons,<br />Then what I learned in history: Ford paying the help and Roosevelt&#8217;s New Deal. Why?</p>
<p>I think the answer is because then they could not write as if skewed income distribution is &#8220;a striking new feature&#8221; and thus suggest as an example of effecting redistribution by targeting the last remaining New Deal concept expressed in the program commonly called Social Security. They specifically rule out that other monster of a New Deal brain storm:</p>
<blockquote><p>“<strong>This does not, however, mean making the personal income tax more progressive, as is often suggested. U.S. taxation of personal income is already quite progressive.</strong> Instead, policymakers should remember that workers do not pay only income taxes; they also pay the FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) payroll tax for social insurance. This tax offers the best way to redistribute income.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well if that is not the ultimate bastardization of the purpose of Social Security. It&#8217;s now proposed to use it as an income redistribution machine.</p>
<p>Think I&#8217;m being to distrusting?</p>
<blockquote><p>“In many ways, today&#8217;s protectionist drift is similar to the challenges faced by the architect of the original New Deal. In August 1934, President Franklin Roosevelt declared:<br />&#8220;Those who would measure confidence in this country in the future must look first to the average citizen. . . .”</p></blockquote>
<p>See, they know the answer.  They know exactly what they are doing here. By the way esteemed professors, stupid is not written on our foreheads.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/07/22/bill-clinton-edelman">Amanda</a> starts her post with something from Bill Clinton as she notes something from ABC News:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clinton said Undersecretary Eric Edelman was “wrong” to send a letter to his wife, Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., criticizing her request for a briefing from Pentagon officials about military plans for a future withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq … In an interview with ABC’s Kate Snow in Lusaka, Zambia, Bill Clinton called Edelman “one of the more ideological holdovers” in the Defense Department. I think it’s wrong to politicize national security,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then Amanda links to <a href="http://thenexthurrah.typepad.com/the_next_hurrah/2007/07/oh-it-was-eric-.html">Mary Wheeler</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>He&#8217;s the bright guy who first suggested leaking Plame&#8217;s identity to rebut Joe Wilson. And, as it turns out, he realized after he suggested to Libby that the information in question may have been classified.</p>
<p>After a June 2003 article about Iraq and the uranium issues that caused concern to Edelman and Libby, Edelman asked Libby whether information about how the Wilson trip came about could be shared with the press to rebut allegations that the Vice president sent Wilson. Edelman testified that Libby responded by indicating that there would be &#8220;complications&#8221; at the CIA in disclosing that information publicly. Ambassador Edelman indicated that he understood that he and Libby could not further discuss the matter because they were speaking on an open telephone line and Edelman understood that this might involve classified information.</p>
<p>Edelman then went on to write a leniency letter, hailing Libby&#8217;s loyalty, with no concern that&#8211;as the guy who first suggested the leak &#8211; the invocation of loyalty reeked of impropriety. You can&#8217;t take someone like that seriously!</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though Edelman put his letter in the public domain, I have heard some of the rightwing water carriers trying to blame Senator Clinton for letting this go public.  Then again &#8211; these same hacks blamed Ms. Plame for her own outing by Dick Cheney and his minions.</p>

<p>The title is from a story by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/business/22refine.html?ex=1342756800&#038;en=812a14004909d5c9&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">Jad Mouawad</a>, which sort of gave me an excuse to summarize some data on retail gasoline prices from <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gaspump.html">this source</a>.  I was looking for an excuse to go there ever since I purchased gasoline in Los Angeles for only $3 a gallon for the first time in a couple of months.  </p>
<p>Our graphs report the real retail price per gallon – where my deflator is the CPI divided by 200, which effectively reports the retail price in terms of 2005QI constant dollars.  The first graph shows that the price today is around twice what it was in early 2000.  We first floated with $3 a gallon gasoline right after Katrina with gasoline prices being on a bit of a roller coaster ever since.  Notice also that the oil components was around $0.75 a gallon in early 2000 and it’s around $1.50 a gallon now.  So oil is about have the story with the doubling of gasoline prices corresponding with the doubling of the oil component.  </p>
<p>But this also means that the sum of non-oil components – taxes, distribution margin, and refinery margin – has also doubled.  Our second graph shows each of these components.  The distribution margin has been quite volatile and at $0.40 per gallon is about twice what it was seven years ago.  But this approximately $0.20 per gallon increased is partially offset by the $0.11 a gallon decline in taxes.  So when discussions turn to refinery margins – this is certainly part of the story behind the increase in gasoline prices.  And over the past two years, the volatility of oil prices appears to be attributable to the volatility of refinery margins.  </p>
<p>Jad Mouawad tries to quickly dismiss one explanation of why refinery margins have increased:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some critics of the industry have theorized on Internet blogs that the squeeze on gasoline and other refined products points to a deliberate effort among oil companies to bolster profits by keeping supplies tight. But experts point out that the companies have little incentive right now to hold back on fuel supplies. “Every refinery would like to run as much crude as possible but they simply can’t,” said David Greely, senior energy economist at Goldman Sachs, who in a recent report compared the drop in domestic refining with an “invisible hurricane.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Mouawad and Greely must have never heard of cartels – a theme we’ll return to.  Rather they see a perfectly competitive market at work:</p>
<blockquote><p>There have been blazes at refineries in Louisiana, Texas, Indiana and California, some of them caused by lightning strikes. Plants have suffered power losses that disrupted operations; a midsize refinery in Kansas was flooded by torrential rains last month. American refiners are running roughly 5 percent below their normal levels at this time of the year. “You have a system that is taxed to the limit,” said Adam Robinson, an energy research analyst at Lehman Brothers. “This is what happens when spare capacity is eroded.” After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita disrupted the nation’s energy lifeline two years ago, oil companies delayed maintenance on many of their plants to make up for lost supplies and take advantage of the high prices. But, analysts say, they are now paying a price for deferring repairs.  As a whole, refining disruptions have been considerably higher than in previous years: they averaged 1.5 million barrels a day in the first quarter, compared with 700,000 to 900,000 barrels a day from 2001 to 2005. In the days after the hurricanes, refiners were forced to briefly halt as many as five million barrels of production.  In 2006, when refiners were still reeling from the impact of the hurricanes, disruptions in the first quarter averaged 1.35 million barrels a day.  Many factors have led to the rise in gas prices, including disruptions in oil supplies from places like Nigeria and Norway. But analysts say the refining bottleneck in North America has been one of the main drivers of higher energy prices this year. The refining crunch has pushed wholesale gasoline prices up 35 percent this year and has contributed to a 23 percent gain for crude oil prices. Oil futures in New York closed at $75.57 a barrel on Friday.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Mother Nature is to blame for the reduction in refinery activity.  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=07&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=refineries_going_down_is_the_o">Dean Baker</a>, however is not so sure: </p>
<blockquote><p>conspiracies do sometimes exist. In the case of energy pricing, we need only go back to the manipulations by those clever boys at Enron that earned the company hundreds of millions of dollars and sent electricity prices soaring in California back in 2001 &#8230; Of course any individual refinery would certainly benefit from pumping out more gas at the current price. But if there was a wink and nod agreement by a few of the biggest companies not to rush repairs, they all would benefit more from the higher prices that result from these refineries being kept off line. My guess is that there is no such agreement and the basic story of refineries being down for needed repairs is true. However, the conspiracy theory folks were right in California in 2001, and the dismissive experts were wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>If an effective refinery cartel were established, the refineries could benefit from withholding supply in order to drive up the wholesale price of gasoline.  But as soon as refinery margins increased, the individual members of the cartel would be tempted to cheat in the form of sub-rosa price cuts in order to gain market share.  A similar view had been put forth with respect to the OPEC cartel by <a href="http://%20/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262011387/lewrockwell">M. A. Adelman</a> many years ago.  Could it be that the recent drop in refinery margins is a sign that this (alleged) cartel is breaking up?</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/07/tim_donaghy.php">Matthew Yglesias</a>, I arrived at <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2943095">this story about the NBA referee</a> who was gambling on games, even games he officiated. </p>
<p>Apparently the FBI is involved, but:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nevada gambling regulators were not involved in an investigation and had no information about the allegations, said Jerry Markling, enforcement chief for the state Gaming Commission and Gaming Control Board. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying that what this guy allegedly did was OK. I can see why the NBA would be unhappy, and a lot of the bookies and folks who wager on sports. But why is it a government matter? I assume if someone finds a way to cheat a blackjack and shows up at a casino, the casino (upon detecting the cheating, or for no reason at all for that matter) can have that person chucked out. But I don&#8217;t think its illegal to cheat at blackjack or other casino games. (Am I wrong about this?) </p>
<p>Clearly I&#8217;m missing something here. It may be because I don&#8217;t wager on sports and therefore am woefully underinformed about some key detail. Apologies for my ignorance, but would someone set me straight on this?</p>

                                <p>Little things have been consequences. There are some things the government simply does better than the private sector, and if the government decides not to do it, we all suffer. </p>
<p>An example coming down the pike is the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6909887.stm">failure to replace the QuickSCAT satellite</a>&#8230; which will hurt our ability to predict storms (read: hurricanes) coming. I note&#8230; QuickSCAT itself is one heck of a success story. It was a rush job, sent up quickly to replace another satellite (NSCAT) that failed, and it was only designed to last 2 to 3 years after its launch in 1999. </p>

<blockquote><p>There was cleavage on display Wednesday afternoon on C-SPAN2. It belonged to Sen. Hillary Clinton.  She was talking on the Senate floor about the burdensome cost of higher education. She was wearing a rose-colored blazer over a black top. The neckline sat low on her chest and had a subtle V-shape. The cleavage registered after only a quick glance. No scrunch-faced scrutiny was necessary. There wasn&#8217;t an unseemly amount of cleavage showing, but there it was. Undeniable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oliver thinks this is really stupid.  I agree.  But if you want cleavage – try <a href="http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/images/blpic-marycarey.htm">Mary Carey</a> who says she has joined the Republican Party.  No, I’m not endorsing a porn star for President but she couldn’t be worse than Rudy McRomney. </p>
<p>What is the next story from Robin Givhan?  What Fred Thompson has that makes his ex girl friends still fond of him?  Pathetic!</p>

                                <p><a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/015667.php">Steve Benen</a> goes back a few weeks to a story written by <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-rudy28jun28,0,5447923,full.story?coll=la-headlines-nation">Maria L. La Ganga</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The world according to Rudolph W. Giuliani is a very, very scary place.  Just listen to the former mayor of New York City in a hotel ballroom in the scorching Midwest, two minutes and 14 seconds into a speech on &#8220;Restoring Fiscal Discipline and Cutting Wasteful Washington Spending.&#8221; &#8220;I will continue to keep America on offense in the terrorist war against us, because I think that&#8217;s the overriding issue of our day,&#8221; he declared. Then he leaped into a detailed discussion that wound its way through earmarks and out-of-control federal budgets to the threat of Democratic tax increases and &#8211; as always &#8211; back to terrorism. While talking taxes, Giuliani spoke of listening to a Democratic presidential debate. &#8220;They never mentioned the word &#8216;Islamic terrorist&#8217; during the debate…. Maybe they think they&#8217;re going to be insulting somebody if they say it. I&#8217;m trying to figure out who would be insulted &#8211; other than Islamic terrorists.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the citizens of Iowa thought they were listening to the ramblings of Sean Hannity.  We already know that Giuliani has decided to repeat the free lunch supply-side lies to justify cuts.  He’s also sounding a lot like Mitt Romney on wanting more defense spending.  Neither one of these candidates have told us where they’d cut Federal spending.  In fact Steve notes that Giuliani supports more Federal spending for <a href="http://www.iowaindependent.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=608">HIV treatments</a> and added:</p>
<blockquote><p>My general experience has been that the federal government works best when it helps and assists and encourages and sets guidelines… on a state-by-state, locality-by-locality basis. It&#8217;s no different from the way I look at homeland security.  Maybe having been mayor of the city, I know that your first defense against terrorist attack is that local police station, or that local firehouse.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are going “huh”, so is Steve who adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m generally not in the habit of offering advice to Republican presidential hopefuls, but I have an idea for the Giuliani campaign. As a way to save time at future appearances, perhaps one of his aides could give Giuliani a placard with the word &#8220;terrorism&#8221; on one side, and &#8220;9/11&#8221; on the other. That way, whenever anyone asks him a question about anything, he can simply point to the sign, instead of having to go to the trouble of coming up with an excuse to end up at the same point anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>Giuliani is not exactly on solid ground talking about fiscal responsibility.  Nor is he some expert on national security.  But hey – he is running for the Republican nomination where honesty is not exactly a prerequisite.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader Sammy finds a piece by <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/06232007/postopinion/opedcolumnists/reaganite_rudy_opedcolumnists_deroy_murdock.htm?page=1">Deroy Murdock</a> of the National Review (this time writing for the NY Post) entitled Reaganite Rudy: Real Fiscal Discipline.  Even though Mr. Murdock’s mendacity has been well established and even though St. Ronald didn’t exactly slash Federal spending either, let’s take a look:</p>
<blockquote><p>* Require that federal agency chiefs propose 5-20 percent spending cuts annually. This would make them streamline their operations and improve services for less money. <br />* Slash federal civilian employment by 21 percent. By 2017, 42 percent of federal workers will retire. Giuliani would replace only half those vacancies. These 150,000 unfilled bureaucratic slots would save taxpayers $21 billion annually, while sparing Americans that many meddlers and nannies. <br />* &#8220;GAPStat,&#8221; a proposed Governmentwide Accountability Program, would evaluate federal activities and correct or eliminate failures. <br />* Place mandatory sunset clauses on all federal programs. Congress would have to rate and reauthorize federal initiatives, or let them expire. <br />* Require Congressional Budget Office price tags on legislation before voting begins on any bill. <br />* Make Washington follow the same Generally Accepted Accounting Principles that it demands of publicly traded companies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn’t amazing?  Not one specific proposal to cut down on the services provided by the Federal government and not one specific proposal to reduce transfer payments.  Just a request that agency chiefs “streamline their operations”.  I have suggested that Mitt Romney is a coward on these issues with his magic formula that has not an ounce of substance.  My apologies to Mr. Romney as Rudy is the truly gutless wonder.  Murdock calls these clever plans.  This is not a plan.  This is a joke. But it’s par for the course for the leaders of the modern Republican Party.</p>

                                <p>Something I&#8217;ve been wondering for a while is whether the real growth rates seen in the FDR administration would be <em>allowed</em> today. Its a strange question considering the number of people who are convinced that the economy simply didn&#8217;t grow in the FDR years until the war started &#8211; they seem to forget the crash and the bulk of the decline that followed occurring during the Hoover administration.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s real GDP per capita for 1929 &#8211; 1932 (Hoover&#8217;s term) and 1933 &#8211; 1940 (FDR&#8217;s first 8 years, before the war).</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqILr0PDHXI/AAAAAAAAAdo/ut4bQcDPthQ/s1600-h/Hoover,+FDR+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqILr0PDHXI/AAAAAAAAAdo/ut4bQcDPthQ/s320/Hoover,+FDR+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Incidentally, the data on real GDP per capita comes from the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">NIPA Table 7.1, line 9</a>, so its as official as it could possibly get.) </p>
<p>In table form with annual percentage growth&#8230; here are the growth rates:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqINDEPDHYI/AAAAAAAAAdw/aUHAhGQm-44/s1600-h/Hoover,+FDR+Table.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqINDEPDHYI/AAAAAAAAAdw/aUHAhGQm-44/s320/Hoover,+FDR+Table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Notice the annualized growth rate&#8230; 5.37%.</p>
<p>This is almost 2 percentage points a year faster than the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">annualized growth rate</a> under JFK/LBJ, the administration under whom growth was fastest in the Post-WW2 years. It was more than twice as fast as under Clinton or Reagan, the second and third fastest growing administrations, and almost 4 times as fast as the annualized growth rate seen so far under GW.</p>
<p>So the question arises&#8230; would the Fed, today, allow that sort of growth rate without clamping down hard for fear of inflation? Does the fact that the economy had dropped 27.5% from 1929 to 1932 make the fast growth that followed, well, OK?</p>
