<blockquote><p>For many economists, questioning free-market orthodoxy is akin to expressing a belief in intelligent design at a Darwin convention: Those who doubt the naturally beneficial workings of the market are considered either deluded or crazy … “There is much too much ideology,” said Alan S. Blinder … Economics, he added, is “often a triumph of theory over fact.” Mr. Blinder helped kindle the discussion by publicly warning in speeches and articles this year that as many as 30 million to 40 million Americans could lose their jobs to lower-paid workers abroad. Just by raising doubts about the unmitigated benefits of free trade, he made headlines and had colleagues rubbing their eyes in astonishment &#8230; “What I’ve learned is anyone who says anything even obliquely that sounds hostile to free trade is treated as an apostate,” Mr. Blinder said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Blinder recently published his concerns over offshoring in <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060301faessay85209/alan-s-blinder/offshoring-the-next-industrial-revolution.html">Foreign Affairs</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In February 2004, when N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard professor then serving as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, caused a national uproar with a &#8220;textbook&#8221; statement about trade, economists rushed to his defense. Mankiw was commenting on the phenomenon that has been clumsily dubbed &#8220;offshoring&#8221; (or &#8220;offshore outsourcing&#8221;) &#8211; the migration of jobs, but not the people who perform them, from rich countries to poor ones. Offshoring, Mankiw said, is only &#8220;the latest manifestation of the gains from trade that economists have talked about at least since Adam Smith &#8230; Although there are no reliable national data, fragmentary studies indicate that well under a million service-sector jobs in the United States have been lost to offshoring to date … That said, we should not view the coming wave of offshoring as an impending catastrophe. Nor should we try to stop it. The normal gains from trade mean that the world as a whole cannot lose from increases in productivity, and the United States and other industrial countries have not only weathered but also benefited from comparable changes in the past. But in order to do so again, the governments and societies of the developed world must face up to the massive, complex, and multifaceted challenges that offshoring will bring. National data systems, trade policies, educational systems, social welfare programs, and politics all must adapt to new realities. Unfortunately, none of this is happening now.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this seems fair enough, <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/07/how-to-be-apostate.html">Greg Mankiw</a> launches four objections:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Alan&#8217;s views are a challenge to the economic mainstream.</p>
<p>2. Alan did not present his new views in a refereed academic publication but instead in Foreign Affairs, a publication aimed at the broad policy community, and then in the Washington Post.</p>
<p>3. Alan&#8217;s new views are conveniently consistent with the political party with which Alan is affiliated.</p>
<p>4. Alan&#8217;s arguments are not persuasive. </p>
<p>It is as if I wrote an article saying that the broad-based income tax cuts raise tax revenue and then published it in the Club for Growth Newsletter with a summary on the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal. My fellow economists would look upon me as an apostate, and they would be right.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll let others be the judge on #4, which is a fair area to debate.  But is Greg saying that a member of my party who is also an economist is not allowed to raise distributional issues?  Fine – then the converse should hold &#8211; every Republican economist must start by discussing the distributional issues of trade policy. And while one has to concede that Foreign Affairs is not the Journal of Political Economy, to compare it to a dishonest rag like the Club for Growth Newsletter is really insulting.  But let me stop and just turn the phone over the Alan Blinder (his comment at Greg’s place):</p>
<blockquote><p>I never blog, and may never again. But this one is over the top, Greg. &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; who posted at 2:28 has it exactly right:</p>
<p>1. Out of the mainstream? Both my friend and former student and I teach introductory economics to some pretty smart students. With me, the first lesson on international trade is that (and why) there are gains from trade. (I love Ricardo!) The second is that trade always creates both winners and losers, though the nation as a whole gains. Don&#8217;t Harvard students hear the second?</p>
<p>2. This is silly. As Greg knows well, refereed journals don&#8217;t publish &#8220;think pieces&#8221; such as mine in Foreign Affairs. And yes, I was tryng to reach non-economists. They are, after all, 99.999% of the human race. (I believe Greg also writes occasionally for nonprofessional audiences&#8211;though not in Econometrica.)</p>
<p>3. Consistent with my party&#8217;s views? That&#8217;s not what many in my party think.</p>
<p>4. Not persuasive? Well, persuasiveness is in the mind of the beholder. I clearly haven&#8217;t persuaded Greg. But, then again, I never persuaded Milton Friedman to stop watching M2.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>This post is on spending on homeownership rates and how they changed over time. And yes, I’ll look at how it changed by administration. Why not? Presidents like to take credit for it. Consider.</p>
<p>Here’s stuff on the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/homeownership/">White House web site</a>. Here’s a speech by GW at HUD <a href="http://www.hud.gov/news/speeches/presremarks.cfm">talking about some of his plans</a>. And <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/03/bush-takes-credit-for-home-ownership.html/">here’s</a> a vintage Angry Bear piece… Kash catches GW crediting an insignificant amount of tax incentives for increased homeownership increases. But there are many reasons a President might affect homeownerhsip. As noted in GW’s speeches, the President funds programs that help people buy homes. There’s HUD. There are tax incentives. And of course, the effect of the economy.</p>
<p>Data goes back to 1965 and comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/hvs/historic/histt14.html">the Census</a>. Given the data is quarterly and not annual, I’m going with Q1 of the year figures. Thus, I’m crediting each President with the first quarter of the year they leave office… hence, Clinton’s figures go from Q1 1993 to Q1 2001, and the percentage change I’m using is the percentage change over that time.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpYXlbCZtKI/AAAAAAAAAaY/zguwT2iHGDY/s1600-h/Homeownership+rate,+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpYXlbCZtKI/AAAAAAAAAaY/zguwT2iHGDY/s320/Homeownership+rate,+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And a summary.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpYYRrCZtMI/AAAAAAAAAao/xjC6MWEEfX8/s1600-h/Homeownership+rate,+table.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpYYRrCZtMI/AAAAAAAAAao/xjC6MWEEfX8/s320/Homeownership+rate,+table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The three Dem admins are one, two, and three. (FWIW, the a means test indicates that the average increase in the change in homeownership is different between Dem and Rep administrations with a P Value of 0.031.  (Note correction&#8230; earlier I had posted .021)) GW comes in fourth, but with rising interest rates, he may yet drop. </p>
<p>And GW has been the beneficiary of extremely low real interest rates, which should only boost home ownership rates. On the other hand, Reagan suffered from high real interest rates as the Fed continued to worry about inflation returning even toward the end of his administration.</p>
<p>But do real interest rates determine the whole thing? Well, no. Under GHW, real interest rates fell&#8230; but so did home ownership. Under Clinton, real rates rose, and were higher for most years than all other administrations except Reagan. LBJ/JFK seems to be in the middle of the pack for real interest rates. </p>
<p>So clearly, other things matter too. </p>
<p>I guess this post suggests some further posts&#8230;. funding on housing programs, and real interest rates. I&#8217;ll try to get to those soon.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>In comments, reader Spencer notes&#8230;  </p>
<blockquote><p>At Census they have ownership rates back to 1900 although it is not as frequent.</p>
<p>What this data shows is that the homeownership rate was very steady in the low 40% from 1900 to 1940. But from 1940 to 1980 it rose steadily from the around 40% level to around 65% level you show in the chart.</p>
<p>If you look at the longer term trend since 1940 the recent rise appears in a different perspective. What it would show is that the rate of increase in homeowners ship rise from 1995 to 2005 <br />is about the sames as was experienced from 1940 to 1980 &#8212; about a half a percentage point each year.</p></blockquote>
<p>I also add&#8230; part of the reason for sustained high real interest rates under Reagan not mentioned earlier was the rapid run-up of the national debt.  So Reagan wasn&#8217;t entirely a victim of circumstance&#8230; this was partly self-inflicted.</p>

                                <p>Is CNN trying to out Fox Faux News for stupidest commentary on cable?  Dr. Sanjay Gupta might come across as a nice guy who knows something about his specialty, which clearly is not health care economics.  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=07&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=michael_gupta_says_medicare_is">Dean Baker</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>CNN’s health care analyst is now telling people that Medicare is going bankrupt.  What does this mean? Medicare’s costs are projected to exceed its revenue and drain the surplus from its trust fund in a bit over a decade, but this has been true at several points in the past. Did Congress tell tens of millions of beneficiaries to get lost? No, Congress appropriated the money needed to keep the program going &#8230; If Dr. Gupta meant to imply that Medicare, as a government program is uniquely inefficient, then he is way off the mark.</p></blockquote>
<p>The other day &#8211; Dr. Gupta got into it with Michael Moore when the former tried to claim that other countries spend more on health care when one adds in what the public sector ponies up.  <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/003176.html">Max Sawicky</a> brings us what Mr. Moore had to say – and why Mr. Moore got this one right too.  If Dr. Gupta wants to play a neurosurgeon on TV – fine.  But let’s stop pretending he’s an expert on everything that is health related.</p>

A few key excerpts from the NY Times article follow:</p>
<blockquote><p>The figures suggested that incremental adjustments by the Beijing authorities in the value of the currency, the yuan, had so far done little to alter a trade picture that has angered American lawmakers and some business groups in Washington &#8230; But the hefty surplus, which increased 27 percent from June 2006, also reflected slowing growth in imports. Imports in June expanded at a relatively modest 14 percent compared with the year before.  The yuan has been allowed to appreciate by a little over 9 percent since China broke the currency’s fixed tie to the United States dollar two years ago. The Bush administration and members of Congress have pressed Beijing to allow the yuan to rise much faster, with some arguing that it be allowed to appreciate by a third or more against the dollar … Mr. Rothman said the value of the yuan was not the most important factor in the Chinese trade picture. American exports to China have increased 188 percent since 2001, a much faster pace of growth than the United States has had with any other major trading partner, despite what some economists argue is the yuan’s artificially low purchasing power.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean is not happy with Andy Rothman:</p>
<blockquote><p>Andy Rothman, a business economist located in Shanghai, asserted that the value of the yuan was not a big factor in the trade deficit that the United States has with China. In other words, if the dollar fell by 20-30 percent against the yuan, and the relative price of Chinese imports to the United States rose by a similar amount, (and the price of U.S. exports to China would fall by a comparable amount), Mr. Rothman believes that there would be little impact on trade.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/dean-bakers-ire.html">Brad DeLong</a> follows up:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is Milton Friedman&#8217;s first rule? That demand curves and supply curves are never vertical, and never horizontal. Demand curves slope down. Supply curves slope up. Quantities matter for determining what prices are. Prices matter for determining what quantities are.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what was Mr. Rothman really saying?  I think the key here is that the Chinese government has allowed the yuan to appreciate by less than 10 percent.  Consider the contention of many that the yuan was overvalued by as much as 40 percent so this process of managed floating has allowed only a partial movement along the demand curve for yuan.  Other events could have shifted the demand curve by more than enough to offset this.  </p>
<p>I like the way that Brad frames this in terms of “Milton Friedman&#8217;s first rule”, which strikes me as a market-clearing approach.  In other words – if the demand curve shifted upwards, then under a floating exchange rate regime the yuan would appreciate by perhaps quite a bit.  But when I push this free floating view of international markets as an endorsement of U.S. fiscal restraint (aka the dollar will devalue which should encourage more net exports), folks remind me of the reality that the yuan is not allowed to freely float.  So maybe Mr. Rothman’s point is that changes in relative prices have not mattered much because the Chinese has not allowed the market to determine the exchange rate.  In other words – if they adopted free floating, how much would the yuan appreciate and how much of an effect on trade flows would this have?  If that was Mr. Rothman’s point, the coverage of his comments in the NY Times article did not convey this very clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: With a hat tip to AB reader Juan, let’s take a look at a discussion by <a href="http://www.feer.com/articles1/2007/0707/free/p014.html">Jonathan Anderson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For those who closely follow the mainland economy, the last few years have provided another interesting spectacle. Remember that the yuan has been strengthening gradually against the dollar, by 2% in 2005, another 4% in 2006 and at a 6% year-on-year pace so far this year. At the same time, Chinese rural migrant wages, which were rising leisurely at 3% to 4% per year at the beginning of the decade, are now shooting up by 10% or even 15% annually as factories come to terms with a dwindling supply of young, single farm workers.  This double-edged sword of an appreciating currency and rising labor costs should have imposed palpable damage on China’s traditional export sectors: toys, clothing, furniture, appliances and electronics processing. However, according to industrial earnings and profit statistics, overall light manufacturing margins have been as steady as a rock, with no signs of pressure so far. Why? Because exporters simply passed on the costs to overseas buyers. In a world where individual country figures rarely tally on pricing trends, one of the startling facts is that Chinese, Hong Kong, U.S., Japanese and European data all agree that mainland export prices have started to rise in the past three years. From 1995 to 2003, dollar prices in traditional manufacturing industries like clothing and toys were falling on the order of 3% to 4% per year. Since 2004, however, those same prices have been rising by 3% to 4% per year, a very visible turnaround from the previous picture. Exactly the same is true for it electronics. According to partner country data, Chinese electronics prices used to fall by 6% to 10% per year in dollar terms. Now they are barely falling at all &#8211; and mainland data actually show a sharp increase in prices since the beginning of the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, China’s productivity has been improving in certain sectors.  At first, their wages were not keeping pace but now with wages rising and the modest amount of yuan appreciation, what had been a steadily falling relative price for Chinese made goods had flat lined if not start reversing itself.  Mr. Anderson makes a case for revaluation without trashing the notion that fixed exchange rates might prove beneficial in certain situations.  In all, an interesting read.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I don&#8217;t see how it can happen with GW in charge, but let&#8217;s say he pulls out a victory in Iraq.</p>
<p>So what does victory look like? MY guess&#8230; best case scenario, at the end of another five or six years of fighting, our allies impose an Islamic theocracy on Iraq. (Or multiple Islamic theocracies of a few different flavors, as has happened in a number of regions in Afghanistan outside Kabhul.) Most of the population is too cowed to say anything and lives in fear. One region of the country is openly more-or-less allied with Iran, another looks something like Pakistan. And just like Pakistan, a very large percentage of the population is openly anti-American, with the remainder being at best indifferent to Americans. Also like Pakistan, the country continues to export instability to the rest of the region.</p>
<p>Its not an unreasonable assumption&#8230; the elements that have been gaining power are religious (Shiites like al Sadr, the Sunni sheikhs in al Anbar that are so conspicuously fighting Al Qaeda), and none are the kind of folks that wouldn&#8217;t happily slit the throat of any American if they thought they could get away with it. </p>
<p>Am I wrong? Is this outcome less likely than a flowering of a pro-Western democracy that leads to peace and prosperity throughout the Middle East? And if I&#8217;m not wrong&#8230; then what? Will such an outcome have been worth it? Will it be worse than the alternative that is likely if there is a pull-out? And where do we go from there?</p>

                                <p>This post is on spending on education by administration.  Its a follow-up to a post I wrote yesterday on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-is-our-children.html">enrollment in school</a>.  </p>
<p>Data comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist03z2.xls">OMB Table 3.2</a>, and I’m using spending on elementary, secondary, vocational, and higher education, along with spending on research and general education aids, all as a percentage of the total federal spending.</p>
<p>So here’s what it looks like.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpTB6Tb6ORI/AAAAAAAAAaI/-hBM0LPao2w/s1600-h/Fed+Budget+on+Education+Graph.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpTB6Tb6ORI/AAAAAAAAAaI/-hBM0LPao2w/s320/Fed+Budget+on+Education+Graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>A summary.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpTB1Db6OQI/AAAAAAAAAaA/_y7v-O7Mv9c/s1600-h/Fed+Budget+on+Education+Table.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpTB1Db6OQI/AAAAAAAAAaA/_y7v-O7Mv9c/s320/Fed+Budget+on+Education+Table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Spending figures may go some way toward explaining the big increases in educational enrollment under JFK/LBJ shown in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-is-our-children.html">in my earlier post on education enrollment</a>.  There were also increases under GW, but he was more middle of the pack despite the big increases in spending in his administration so far.  Now, it may go some way toward excusing him, but considering enrollment was above 90% for the 14 to 17 year olds, there wasn’t much further upside.  Except, of course, that with people picked by Rod Paige counting the numbers, who believes them?  On the plus side, all that spending has  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Bush">attracted some of the finest minds</a> into the industry, so no doubt there really is some progress of some kind.  It’s a welcome change to see that W getting some results after a huge amount of spending.</p>
<p>Some correlations&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpTBvTb6OPI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/wDGG4M4n1Bw/s1600-h/Fed+Budget+on+Education+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpTBvTb6OPI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/wDGG4M4n1Bw/s320/Fed+Budget+on+Education+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>It isn’t much, but it does seem like a spending increase in one year leads to a bit of an increase in enrollment in the next year (14 – 17 year olds) or the year after (20 – 24 year olds), though these correlations aren’t strong.  And the more people enrolling in college, the greater the increase in federal spending the next year.  I assume part of the difference is that a lot of the funding comes from state and local sources.</p>

                                <p>Now that I&#8217;m married, its time to act kinda responsibly. So its time to get new living wills, powers of attorney, etc.</p>
<p>Most of these forms are available online. As to the trust&#8230; I can&#8217;t find copies online, but I have an old trust form I paid for some years back &#8211; hard copy only. Its now outdated&#8230; it comes from the time before I met the Ex-GF. I don&#8217;t feel like paying for it to be updated, and besides, I&#8217;d like to have a soft copy so I could make more changes as my life changes further without having to go to an attorney every time. So I&#8217;m starting to type up the trust form myself. </p>
<p>Its boring but educational. And confusing. People always say you need a trust rather than a will to avoid probate. But if I understand things correctly, you still need a will. And the will turns everything over to the trust. And then the trust turns everything over to the beneficiary. Is this right? What kind of convoluted nonsense is this?</p>
<p>Anyone care to explain what is going on in comments. I bet I&#8217;m not the only one confused.</p>

                                <p>Over the past few years, Atrios has been documenting the Friedmans; every few days he has a link to something said by someone in the administration, a congresscritter, or a cheerleader about how it is necessary to give the current situation in Iraq another six months. In each case, the quote is from six months earlier, and he&#8217;s been doing this for years, and some of the same characters crop up again and again and again. </p>
<p>Apparently, this week there&#8217;s a bumper crop&#8230; <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/escalation-list/">Think Progress</a> got into the act put together a list of some of them all in one place. <a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/">Atrios</a> has even more scattered throughout various posts today.</p>
<p>And now that another Friedman has come and gone, so what?  Well, we need another Friedman, or three.  At which point we&#8217;ll need another.  This is how the Hundred Years War became the Hundred Years War.</p>

                                <p><strong>George Will Blames FDR for the Continuation of the Great Depression</strong></p>

<p>Nobel Prize Winning Economist (NOT) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/06/AR2007070601927.html">George Will</a> dusts off an old favorite from the rightwing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some mornings during the autumn of 1933, when the unemployment rate was 22 percent, the president, before getting into his wheelchair, sat in bed, surrounded by economic advisers, setting the price of gold. One morning he said he might raise it 21 cents: &#8220;It&#8217;s a lucky number because it&#8217;s three times seven.&#8221; His Treasury secretary wrote that if people knew how gold was priced &#8220;they would be frightened.&#8221;  The Depression&#8217;s persistence, partly a result of such policy flippancy, was frightening…. This transformation was actually assisted by the misguided policies &#8211; including government-created uncertainties that paralyzed investors &#8211; that prolonged the Depression.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Will seems to be in love with <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780066211701/The_Forgotten_Man/index.aspx">The Forgotten Man</a> by Amity Shlaes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shlaes also traces the mounting agony of the New Dealers themselves as they discovered their errors. She shows how both Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt failed to understand the prosperity of the 1920s and heaped massive burdens on the country that more than offset the benefit of New Deal programs. The real question about the Depression, she argues, is not whether Roosevelt ended it with World War II. It is why the Depression lasted so long. From 1929 to 1940, federal intervention helped to make the Depression great &#8211; in part by forgetting the men and women who sought to help one another.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess you would not be surprised to learn that Ms. Shlaes used to write op-eds for the Wall Street Journal.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Forgotten-Man-History-Great-Depression/dp/0066211700">Amazon</a> provides an interesting review of her new book:</p>
<blockquote><p>This breezy narrative comes from the pen of a veteran journalist and economics reporter. Rather than telling a new story, she tells an old one (scarcely lacking for historians) in a fresh way. Shlaes brings to the tale an emphasis on economic realities and consequences, especially when seen from the perspective of monetarist theory, and a focus on particular individuals and events, both celebrated and forgotten (at least relatively so).</p></blockquote>
<p>Her tale seems to be a very old story indeed.  But back to Mr. Will who focused not on monetary policy but on the increase in government spending:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before Roosevelt, the federal government was unimpressive relative to the private sector. Under Calvin Coolidge, the last pre-Depression president, its revenue averaged 4 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 18.6 percent today. In 1910, Congress legislated height limits for Washington buildings, limits that prevented skyscrapers, symbols of mighty business, from overshadowing the Capitol, the symbol of government.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where to start?  Let’s give the microphone over to <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_07/011658.php">Kevin Drum</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dude: That was 74 years ago. What&#8217;s more, there was even a reason for it. Roosevelt scholars should feel free to jump in and correct me if I get this wrong, but my recollection is that FDR wanted to raise the price of gold as a way of inducing inflation — a policy that, correct or not in hindsight, was certainly defensible given the farm crisis he was dealing with at the time — but that he wanted the price to rise gradually and erratically so that speculators couldn&#8217;t take advantage of predictable movements. Lots of people were appalled by Roosevelt&#8217;s apparent casualness about the gold price, but as usual, there was method to his madness. I, for one, am glad that he was president in 1933 and not George Will.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep – the debt deflation theory that economist bloggers debated about six months ago.  We mentioned it <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/does-deflation-increase-aggregate.html">here</a> with links to a few other posts and readings that George Will apparently cannot follow. </p>
<p>On the size of the government, Will wants to compare Federal revenues under Coolidge to what we are seeing today without admitting to his readers that Federal transfer payments today are higher than they were under FDR.  But why don’t we look instead at total government purchases in 1929 (first year of recorded data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis), which was almost 14% of GDP as compared to the somewhat higher level under FDR today or today.  But hey – we have a larger defense establishment today than we did in 1929.  Is Mr. Will advocating we get rid of the Pentagon?  </p>
<p>As we noted earlier in the year, investment demand does not appear to be spooked by FDR’s Administration.  But just in case Mr. Will needs a picture – he can check out our graph of investment demand (2000$) from 1929 to 1940, which is taken from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">this source</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDFlOGU5OGFhOWE2MTFlZTA4Njg5ODJmZWNiN2ZhMjM=&#038;w=MQ==">KLo</a> interviews Amity Shlaes and asks her about the books she relied upon when writing her own book on the Great Depression.  Not mentioned were Friedman and Schwartz’s A Monetary History of the United States of Charles Kindleberger’s The World in Depression, The General Theory by Lord Keynes, or even Schumpeter’s Business Cycles: A Theoretical, Historical, and Statistical Analysis of the Capitalist Process.  No mention of any of the academic publications on this period either.  No – her main reference seems to have been FDR’s Folly by Jim Powell.  While it may be the perfect book for the wingnuts, I’m not rushing out to purchase it myself.</p>
