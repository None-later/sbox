                                <p><a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2007/jul/02/predicting_with_a_handicap_why_are_economists_predictions_so_often_wrong">Jared Bernstein</a> did say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economists sometimes serve vested interests, and will change their views accordingly. The best example is also one of the best economists, Greg Mankiw. This textbook-writing Harvard prof was Bush’s chief economist for awhile, and during his confirmation hearing and subsequent tenure at the White House, he constantly defended Bushonomics, including supply-side beliefs that he once argued were the musings of “cranks and charlatans.&#8221; Now, Mankiw may well have felt he could do the nation more good if he were working from the inside, trying to nudge the administration’s economic policy in a better direction (if so, he failed). But if we’re going to argue in support of ideas on Monday that we correctly dismissed as nutty last Friday, we’re unlikely to be either correct or credible.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/07/on-charlatons-and-cranks.html">Greg Mankiw</a> objects:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jared Bernstein, a bigshot at the left-wing thinktank Economic Policy Institute, seems to think I am a hypocrite.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Now we’re getting personal</em>.  But there is a problem with what Greg said as <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/003161.html">Max Sawicky</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the question is whether Mankiw&#8217;s performance at the CEA was faithful to his academic militance. For that one would have to dredge up CEA statements that conflict with textbook and other academic statements. In his book, NGM is forthright that the giant revenue response from a tax cut is hokum. In his testimony, he is less emphatic, or as he puts it, &#8220;skeptical&#8221; of such claims. Moreover, he asserted that the Bush Administration did not adhere to the &#8220;extreme&#8221; view</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s sort of like saying this White House never claimed Saddam and Osama were linked.  Max also reminds us of what <a href="http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2007/03/mccain_and_mank.html">Brendan Nyhan</a> said when Mankiw went after McCain’s conversion to free lunch supply-side-ism:</p>
<blockquote><p>But what Mankiw doesn&#8217;t mention is President Bush and Vice President Cheney&#8217;s expressed &#8220;fealty to the most extreme supply-side views,&#8221; which Mankiw conspicuously failed to change during his tenure as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2003 to 2005. Indeed, during his Senate confirmation hearing, Mankiw was asked about claims that tax cuts were self-financing, and he disavowed them, saying &#8220;I remain skeptical of those claims.&#8221; However, he also stated that he thought the administration had not made such claims, which was &#8211; and is &#8211; false</p></blockquote>
<p>Brendan also asks whether Mankiw will keep Mitt Romney from making free lunch claims.  So far – it is an open question.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/max-sawicky-on-.html">Brad DeLong</a> has more.</p>

<blockquote><p>On June 9, 2003, just one day after his national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice, got beaten up on the Sunday shows for claiming no one in the administration knew that the Niger intelligence was bunk, George Bush expressed concern about the allegations. Scooter Libby passed on that concern to vice president Cheney. Bush&#8217;s concern set off a chain of events that ended up in the outing of a CIA spy, Valerie Plame, and the indictment and conviction of Scooter Libby &#8230; the real effect of Bush&#8217;s actions is to prevent Libby from revealing the truth about Bush&#8217;s &#8211; and vice president Cheney&#8217;s &#8211; own actions in the leak. By commuting Libby&#8217;s sentence, Bush protected himself and his vice president from potential criminal exposure for their actions in the CIA Leak. As such, Libby&#8217;s commutation is nothing short of another obstruction of justice.  Cheney&#8217;s involvement in the CIA leak case is central. He personally undertook research on Joe Wilson and his trip; while doing that research, Cheney learned that Wilson&#8217;s wife worked in the counter-proliferation division of the CIA, the part of the clandestine services that fights the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Cheney then passed on the news of Plame&#8217;s CIA identity to Libby. When, on July 6, 2003, Joe Wilson publicly accused the administration of fixing the case for war in an op-ed in the New York Times. Cheney cut out the op-ed and wrote his notes on it. &#8220;Have they done this sort of thing? Send an ambassador to answer a question? Do we ordinarily send people out pro bono to work for us?&#8221; After writing those questions about the circumstances of the trip, he wrote one more question, making an accusation that would show up later in leaks to journalists. &#8220;Or did his wife send him on a junket?&#8221; When Joe Wilson criticised the administration publicly, Cheney&#8217;s response was to insinuate that Wilson&#8217;s wife &#8211; whom Cheney knew worked in the clandestine side of the CIA &#8211; was somehow doing something improper.  The next day or the day after, Cheney ordered Scooter Libby to leak something to the New York Times&#8217; Judith Miller. Libby hesitated. He couldn&#8217;t leak it, Libby said, because it was classified. But Cheney reassured Libby that President Bush had unilaterally declassified the material. Libby was still worried, so he asked Cheney&#8217;s counsel, David Addington, whether the president could just unilaterally declassify something. When Addington assured him that the president could, Libby seemed satisfied.  Shortly thereafter, Scooter Libby leaked to Miller Valerie Plame&#8217;s identity and the contents of the CIA report on Wilson&#8217;s trip to Niger. Libby would later say that Cheney had declassified the NIE, and not Plame&#8217;s identity or the trip report. But there&#8217;s no paperwork to support this claim, just the word of a convicted perjurer. Furthermore, Libby testified that Cheney had ordered him to leak this material exclusively &#8211; and Libby had already leaked the NIE to two other reporters. The two pieces of information that Libby leaked to Miller exclusively, after Cheney ordered Libby to leak information to her, were Plame&#8217;s identity and the CIA report on Wilson&#8217;s trip. The following Monday, July 14, when a Robert Novak article published Plame&#8217;s covert identity, Cheney and Libby already knew it would appear. The first thing they did that morning was ask their CIA briefer if he had read it &#8211; they told him that it was not his problem. As if they already knew it was somebody&#8217;s problem.  Later that fall, as the scandal erupted, Libby asked Cheney to ensure that the White House spokesperson publicly exonerated him, as he had earlier done for Karl Rove. To make sure this happened, the Vice President started to write a note, &#8220;Not going to protect one staffer [meaning Rove] and sacrifice the guy the President&#8230;&#8221; But then Cheney stopped. He crossed out the first four letters of the word, &#8220;President&#8221; and finished the sentence: &#8220;&#8230;that was asked to stick his neck in the meat grinder because of the incompetence of others.&#8221; He came close to writing that President Bush had asked Libby to take the lead on responding to Wilson. And then, according to some trial testimony, he got Bush to make sure Libby got his public exoneration, a public claim that Libby had nothing to do with the leak of Plame&#8217;s identity. Then, finally, before Scooter Libby told the FBI his now-discredited story about learning Plame&#8217;s identity anew from Tim Russert, Libby went and told the vice president what he was going to tell them. The only person, apparently, that Libby shared his lies with was the one guy &#8211; the vice president &#8211; who knew they weren&#8217;t true.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did Dick Cheney start a chain of events that led to the Novak column?  Of course he did.  That was the plan.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/marcy-wheeler-o.html">Brad DeLong</a> also understands PlameGate:</p>
<blockquote><p>The balance of the probabilities is that Scooter Libby perjured himself and obstructed justice because he knew things about Cheney that were deeply embarrassing and discrediting, and because he believed that Patrick Fitzgerald was a special prosector like Kenneth Starr &#8211; one who believed that the core of his job was to leak as many grand jury secrets as he could as long as they were discreditable to the president&#8217;s party. Thus Libby thought that perjury was the better part of valor given that he needed to protect his boss from the discreditable and embarrassing possibility that people would learn how he behaved.  There is also the possibility that Scooter Libby perjured himself because for him to testify truthfully would have led to the impeachment and removal from office of Cheney and Bush. Now we will never know which.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, I think we do.  Had the truth come out before November 2004, John Kerry would be President today and this talk about impeachment would be moot.  Which is why the White House slow rolled this investigation.  Had Libby told the truth sometime after the November 2004 elections, we would be having impeachment hearings if not a Senate trial by now.  But it seems actual impeachment occurs only for partisan reasons as the impeachment of Andrew Johnson by the radical Republicans in 1868 or the impeachment of Bill Clinton by the corrupt Republicans in 1998.  Nixon’s corrupt behavior deserved impeachment, which never occurred.  But that’s because Nixon resigned in August 1974 when principled conservatives like Senator Goldwater called on him to resign.  Bush and Cheney are much more corrupt than Nixon ever was.  So where are the principled conservatives today?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2007/07/03/BL2007070301366.html">Dan Froomkin</a> also understands PlameGate:</p>
<blockquote><p>All of this means that Bush&#8217;s decision yesterday to commute Libby&#8217;s prison sentence isn&#8217;t just a matter of unequal justice. It is also a potentially self-serving and corrupt act.  Was there a quid pro quo at work? Was Libby being repaid for falling on his sword and protecting his bosses from further scrutiny? Alternately, was he being repaid for his defense team&#8217;s abrupt decision in mid-trial not to drag Cheney into court, where he would have faced cross-examination by Fitzgerald? &#8230; Bush&#8217;s written statement announcing clemency was a clear attempt to suggest that he was splitting the difference between those who supported and opposed a pardon for Libby. But in fact, Bush&#8217;s order grants Libby everything he needs in the short run while still keeping open the possibility of a pardon in the long run, as Bush heads out the door. And to law-and-order types, Bush&#8217;s message may actually be more galling. For Bush to state he believed Libby to be innocent would at least have been defensible. Instead, what Bush is saying is that acknowledges the guilty verdict &#8211; but, when it comes to his friends and colleagues, he just doesn&#8217;t care what the justice system concluded was a fitting punishment.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is clear – yesterday’s commutation was a continuation of the cover-up.  CNN just played Mitt Romney excusing this act by saying Bill Clinton issued pardons too.  Not only is Mitt Romney playing the childish game exhibited by Bush apologist buffpilot (see comments to my posts on this), he is missing the whole point about this cover-up.  Or does Mr. Romney think GOP cover-ups are simply patriotism?</p>

The issue involved the following hypothetical:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the [Constitutional] convention George Mason argued that the President might use his pardoning power to &#8220;pardon crimes which were advised by himself&#8221; or, before indictment or conviction, &#8220;to stop inquiry and prevent detection.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>James Madison noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]f the President be connected, in any suspicious manner, with any person, and there be grounds tp believe he will shelter him, the House of Representatives can impeach him; they can remove him if found guilty</p></blockquote>
<p>J. Elliot noted this in The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 74.  Elliot further noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>the President could be suspended when suspected, and his powers would devolve on the Vice President, who could likewise be suspended until impeached and convicted, if he were also suspected.</p></blockquote>
<p>James Madison’s wisdom certainly applies today.</p>

                                <p>This post looks at the male population 18 – 24 and the homicide rate. Not long ago, I had a post on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-murder.html">homicide rate</a>, and I noted that the murder rate declined fastest under Clinton among all Presidents. Naturally, that means something else is at play (just as it was with other series, such as the abortion rate, real GDP per capita, paying off the debt, etc.), because we all know Clinton can’t possibly be given credit for something that went well during his administrations. Two culprits emerged… either it was the states with their 3 strikes laws, or demographics just happened to favor Clinton. (Note… the post also showed a positive correlation between the stock price of Sturm, Ruger as a share of the S&#038;P 500 and the subsequent’s year murder rate. Sturm, Ruger was chosen because unlike other publicly traded gun manufacturers, guns are its primary line of business, and it sells mostly to civilians in the domestic market.) </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have a comment about 3 strikes laws at the end of this post. But I now have some cleaned up Census demographics data. Data from 1980 to 2005 comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0011.xls">here</a>, and reader I. Kitov pointed me to data going back further <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/pre-1980/PE-11.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>OK. So here’s what the male 18 – 24 population, them folks most likely to commit murder and mayhem, looks like…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Roo-Mjb6N8I/AAAAAAAAAXg/Anh-o3OVZk8/s1600-h/Males+18+-+24+Graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Roo-Mjb6N8I/AAAAAAAAAXg/Anh-o3OVZk8/s320/Males+18+-+24+Graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here’s a summary…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Roo3ijb6N4I/AAAAAAAAAXA/IrNbs0JyN1E/s1600-h/Males+18+-+24+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Roo3ijb6N4I/AAAAAAAAAXA/IrNbs0JyN1E/s320/Males+18+-+24+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Well… it doesn’t appear that the big drop in the homicide rate under Clinton is due to demographics. Ike, Reagan, and GHW all had much more favorable demographics, but of those, only Reagan showed a decline in the murder rate, and much, much lower than under Clinton.</p>
<p>Here’s the murder rate per 100,000 and the males 18 – 24 per 100 people. </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Roo3rDb6N5I/AAAAAAAAAXI/ddSmHK3XeDU/s1600-h/Males+18+-+24+Graph+2.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Roo3rDb6N5I/AAAAAAAAAXI/ddSmHK3XeDU/s320/Males+18+-+24+Graph+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what conclusion I can reach from this, but concluding that the decline in the murder rate under Clinton was due to demographics seems a stretch. </p>
<p>Which leads to one final excuse&#8230; does anyone know where I can find a list of all the states that enacted three strikes laws and in what year. Here&#8217;s my reasoning&#8230; presumably, if those laws are the reason for this, as reader Sebastian Holsclaw insists, the murder rate in each state will decline beginning with the passage of the law. Meanwhile, states without those laws shouldn&#8217;t show much or any decline in the murder rate.</p>
<p>Offhand, I only about three states&#8230; Washington passed the first 3 strikes law in 1993, CA in 1994, and NY didn&#8217;t pass one at all. Here&#8217;s the problem&#8230; <a href="http://bjsdata.ojp.usdoj.gov/dataonline/Search/Homicide/State/StatebyState.cfm">Bureau of Justice Statistics State Homicide figures</a> show that for CA, the number of homicides in the state did in fact peak in 1993, which would be consistent with the notion of 3 strikes having an impact. Sadly, it bottomed out in 1999, without any repeal of the law. </p>
<p>NY&#8230; the peak occurred in 1990, and one heck of a decline (number of murders dropped from 2605 in 1990 to 889 in 2004 &#8211; far more impressive than the decline in CA) after that&#8230; without any 3 strikes law. In Washington, murders peaked in 1994&#8230; after the 3 strikes law was already in place. So&#8230; the 3 strikes story is plausible for CA, a stretch but possible for WA, and not useful for explaining the really big drop in murders. </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>I’ll see if there’s any more information I can extract from demographic info soon.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/02/libby.sentence/index.html">CNN</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush has commuted the prison term of former White House aide I. Lewis &#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby, facing 30 months in prison after a federal court convicted him of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators.  Earlier Monday, a federal appeals court unanimously ruled that Libby could not delay his sentence. The charges relate to the 2003 leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame&#8217;s identity.  Libby was only weeks away from surrendering to a prison.  Bush was under great pressure by Libby allies to pardon the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. In a written statement issued hours after that ruling, Bush called the sentence &#8220;excessive.&#8221; But he also rejected calls for a pardon for Libby. &#8220;The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer, public servant, and private citizen will be long-lasting,&#8221; Bush said. But he said Libby was given &#8220;a harsh sentence based in part on allegations never presented to the jury.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The President dusts off the rightwing talking points.  Pathetic.  But in one way the sentence was “excessive”.  Having the prospect of serving a 30 month jail sentence, the pressure for Mr. Libby to rat out Dick Cheney and George W. Bush might have become too much for him to bear.  </p>
<p>The good folks at <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/003579.php">TPMmuckraker</a> have the President’s incredibly dishonest statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit today rejected Lewis Libby’s request to remain free on bail while pursuing his appeals for the serious convictions of perjury and obstruction of justice. As a result, Mr. Libby will be required to turn himself over to the Bureau of Prisons to begin serving his prison sentence. I have said throughout this process that it would not be appropriate to comment or intervene in this case until Mr. Libby’s appeals have been exhausted. But with the denial of bail being upheld and incarceration imminent, I believe it is now important to react to that decision. From the very beginning of the investigation into the leaking of Valerie Plame’s name, I made it clear to the White House staff and anyone serving in my administration that I expected full cooperation with the Justice Department. Dozens of White House staff and administration officials dutifully cooperated. After the investigation was under way, the Justice Department appointed United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois Patrick Fitzgerald as a Special Counsel in charge of the case. Mr. Fitzgerald is a highly qualified, professional prosecutor who carried out his responsibilities as charged.<br />This case has generated significant commentary and debate. Critics of the investigation have argued that a special counsel should not have been appointed, nor should the investigation have been pursued after the Justice Department learned who leaked Ms. Plame’s name to columnist Robert Novak. Furthermore, the critics point out that neither Mr. Libby nor anyone else has been charged with violating the Intelligence Identities Protection Act or the Espionage Act, which were the original subjects of the investigation. Finally, critics say the punishment does not fit the crime: Mr. Libby was a first-time offender with years of exceptional public service and was handed a harsh sentence based in part on allegations never presented to the jury. Others point out that a jury of citizens weighed all the evidence and listened to all the testimony and found Mr. Libby guilty of perjury and obstructing justice. They argue, correctly, that our entire system of justice relies on people telling the truth. And if a person does not tell the truth, particularly if he serves in government and holds the public trust, he must be held accountable. They say that had Mr. Libby only told the truth, he would have never been indicted in the first place. Both critics and defenders of this investigation have made important points. I have made my own evaluation. In preparing for the decision I am announcing today, I have carefully weighed these arguments and the circumstances surrounding this case.<br />Mr. Libby was sentenced to thirty months of prison, two years of probation, and a $250,000 fine. In making the sentencing decision, the district court rejected the advice of the probation office, which recommended a lesser sentence and the consideration of factors that could have led to a sentence of home confinement or probation. I respect the jury’s verdict. But I have concluded that the prison sentence given to Mr. Libby is excessive. Therefore, I am commuting the portion of Mr. Libby’s sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison.<br />My decision to commute his prison sentence leaves in place a harsh punishment for Mr. Libby. The reputation he gained through his years of public service and professional work in the legal community is forever damaged. His wife and young children have also suffered immensely. He will remain on probation.The significant fines imposed by the judge will remain in effect. The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer, public servant, and private citizen will be long-lasting. The Constitution gives the President the power of clemency to be used when he deems it to be warranted. It is my judgment that a commutation of the prison term in Mr. Libby’s case is an appropriate exercise of this power.</p></blockquote>
<p>The line about “I made it clear to the White House staff and anyone serving in my administration that I expected full cooperation with the Justice Department. Dozens of White House staff and administration officials dutifully cooperated” is a bald faced lie. This commutation was part of the cover-up process.</p>
<p>Earlier, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/07/02/joe-wilson-libby-pardon">Faiz</a> brought us the recent words of Joseph Wilson who rightfully argued that the proponents of a Libby pardon were accessories to an ongoing crime.  I would add to that the simple premise that George W. Bush abused his Constitutional powers to complete this cover-up and obstructions of justice.  I can hardly wait for the celebration from the National Review – which has been central players to this ongoing obstruction.  Rule of Law Party my a$$.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>So the President intervened and commuted Scooter Libby&#8217;s sentence. The official White House statement is <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/07/20070702-3.html">here</a> and includes these paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Libby was sentenced to thirty months of prison, two years of probation, and a $250,000 fine. In making the sentencing decision, the district court rejected the advice of the probation office, which recommended a lesser sentence and the consideration of factors that could have led to a sentence of home confinement or probation. </p>
<p>I respect the jury&#8217;s verdict. But I have concluded that the prison sentence given to Mr. Libby is excessive. Therefore, I am commuting the portion of Mr. Libby&#8217;s sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison. </p>
<p>My decision to commute his prison sentence leaves in place a harsh punishment for Mr. Libby. The reputation he gained through his years of public service and professional work in the legal community is forever damaged. His wife and young children have also suffered immensely. He will remain on probation. The significant fines imposed by the judge will remain in effect. The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer, public servant, and private citizen will be long-lasting. </p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I think:<br />1. His reputation is not &#8220;forever damaged&#8221; &#8211; at least not among the folks on the Right. They don&#8217;t think he did anything wrong. Otherwise, they wouldn&#8217;t have been pushing so hard for a pardon. <br />2. As a result of 1., friendly Republicans will pay his fine. Not directly, of course&#8230; they&#8217;ll pay him a big speaking fee for a few engagements. <br />3. Nobody will pay any price for burning Plame, and everyone else associated with the same cover agency&#8230; regardless of the cost to the taxpayer. Well&#8230; I guess if the conviction holds, Scooter isn&#8217;t going to be able to open a bar that serves alcohol, at least until another Republican President sees fit to give him a full pardon. <br />4. And I wonder what message this gives to other administration folks thinking of perjuring themselves. </p>
<p>And then I have one more thought&#8230; isn&#8217;t this argument, in effect, saying that child molesters shouldn&#8217;t have to serve time in jail? After all&#8230; someone convicted of child molestation really, truly has their reputation shredded into tatters, and as we learned from Mr. Bush, a fine, probation, and a damaged reputation constitute &#8220;harsh punishment.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>The piece in the Times got me thinking about this question of why members of my profession are competing with weathermen for accuracy kudos. So let me count the ways: here’s a list of reasons I think economists often get it wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jared was referring to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/02/opinion/02schwartz.html?_r=2&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">this piece</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The assumption that underlies the project is simple: people respond to incentives. If you want people to do something, you have to make it worth their while. This assumption drives virtually all of economic theory. Sure, there are already many rewards in learning: gaining understanding (of yourself and others), having mysterious or unfamiliar aspects of the world opened up to you, demonstrating mastery, satisfying curiosity, inhabiting imaginary worlds created by others, and so on. Learning is also the route to more prosaic rewards, like getting into good colleges and getting good jobs. But these rewards are not doing the job. If they were, children would be doing better in school.  The logic of the plan reveals a second assumption that economists make: the more motives the better. Give people two reasons to do something, the thinking goes, and they will be more likely to do it, and they’ll do it better, than if they have only one. Providing some cash won’t disturb the other rewards of learning, rewards that are intrinsic to the process itself. They will only provide a little boost. Mr. Fryer’s reward scheme is intended to add incentives to the ones that already exist. Unfortunately, these assumptions that economists make about human motivation, though intuitive and straightforward, are false. In particular, the idea that adding motives always helps is false. There are circumstances in which adding an incentive competes with other motives and diminishes their impact. Psychologists have known this for more than 30 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jared adds four other pieces of baggage that we often carry around with us when we try to forecase the future:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are other things economists do well. Our empirical methods, in the right hands, can be highly informative and useful. But, like Yogi said, prediction is hard, especially when it comes to the future. When you’re carrying all this baggage along with you, it’s even harder.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t even try to forecast.  And if I did try forecasting something like the stock price of a company, most of my friends would likely short sell the stocks that I think will do well.  But the local weatherman is saying the Fourth in LA will be hot and sunny.  You think?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: William Polley comes to the defense of traditional economics in a post entitled <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2007/07/#000867">Does Tiger Woods ever play golf just for fun?</a>.  After a lot of reflection on the op-ed by Barry Schwartz, Bill answers his rhetorical question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Would Tiger Woods play more golf than he does now if he was only doing it for fun and there was no financial reward? Probably not. So Tiger Woods appears to be responding in a standard economic way to the incentives, but the children in the study are not.  What gives?</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm.  Nursery school children don’t have to make choices as to the allocation of their scarce time which would fundamentally impact the economic well being of their families.  But adults do.  Hey, I would love to run more but my talents aren’t such that I could make a living doing so.  Alas, the talents that pay me involve sitting at a keyboard writing.  Then again – I’m not paid to blog so one does have to wonder why I’m doing so right day and not running down some Los Angeles trail.  Oh wait – it’s that weather thing again.  If only we had an air conditioned indoor mall with a track around it.</p>

<blockquote><p>A secret U.S. law enforcement report, prepared for the Department of Homeland Security, warns that al Qaeda is planning a terror “spectacular” this summer, according to a senior official with access to the document.” This is reminiscent of the warnings and intelligence we were getting in the summer of 2001,” the official told ABCNews.com.  U.S. officials have kept the information secret, and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said today on ABC News’ “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” that the United States did not have “have any specific credible evidence that there’s an attack focused on the United States at this point.” As ABCNews.com reported, U.S. law enforcement officials received intelligence reports two weeks ago warning of terror attacks in Glasgow and Prague, the Czech Republic, against &#8220;airport infrastructure and aircraft.&#8221; The warnings apparently never reached officials in Scotland, who said this weekend they had received &#8220;no advance intelligence&#8221; that Glasgow might be a target. Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff declined to comment specifically on the report today, but said &#8220;everything that we get is shared virtually instantaneously with our counterparts in Britain and vice versa.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It would be an outrage, indeed, if we had solid intelligence about an attack in the UK and didn’t get around to warning them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Who to trust – ABC News or the Bush Administration?</p>

                                <p>I was waiting for this. From Betsy&#8217;s Page, a blog on the right, a story about <a href="http://betsyspage.blogspot.com/2007/07/david-broder-sorta-gets-one-rightand.html">Ron Paul</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which Representative from the Houston area would you bet has the most earmark requests? Well, the surprise is that the leader is the <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/metro/4935311.html">libertarian Ron Paul</a> who supposedly disdains almost all federal spending.</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Lake Jackson, the Libertarian-leaning contender for the Republican presidential nomination, long has waged war on the widespread federal spending he views as outside constitutional boundaries.</p>
<p>But the congressman, who often votes against spending bills, including funds for the Iraq war, leads the Houston-area delegation in the number of earmarks, or special funding requests, that he is seeking for his district. He is trying to nab public money for 65 projects, such as marketing wild shrimp and renovating the old movie theater in Edna that closed in 1977 — neither of which is envisioned in the Constitution as an essential government function.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, the irony.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess that makes Ron Paul <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-size-of-government.html">similar to Ron Reagan</a>. But then, which Republican candidate isn&#8217;t?</p>

                                <p>As I’ve mentioned before, I’m thinking of collecting a lot of posts into a book form.  I figure the graphs produce a useful history, even if you don’t believe that the President could possibly have had anything to do with anything involving this country.  </p>
<p>So here’s the rough plan going forward for the next few whiles…  a few posts on things the President doesn’t control… demographics and maybe some Fed stuff.  Then a few on education.  Also… I’d like to have a few posts on the military… I’ve found that recently they’ve changed the location for a lot of military data and a lot of the links I have are now broken.  I think I can data for number of military personnel from the Statistical Abstract of the US.  But… I’m also interested in standards applied to new recruits (I keep hearing that standards have dropped in recent years – is this true?) and one on pay for military personnel… if possible, for enlisted personnel and for officers separately.  Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>Also… anyone know where I can get annual data on Veteran’s affairs?  The Statistical Abstract has assorted years, and the VA site is awful for that purpose.  I’ve also located a bit of data on education.  Any other topics y’all wanna see covered?  No guarantees of course, but I can do my best.  And of course, pointing to a data source is not unhelpful.  </p>
<p>Anyway, as a starting point… here’s population since 1980 <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0011.xls">population of the US since 1980</a>.  (I can only find detail on various age subgroups through 1980.) As always, I’ve broken it up by President, though I don’t think the President has much effect on population.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RojrZDb6N3I/AAAAAAAAAW4/o2s0oq7jQpo/s1600-h/Population,+Graph.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RojrZDb6N3I/AAAAAAAAAW4/o2s0oq7jQpo/s320/Population,+Graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here’s a summary, by Presidency.</p>
<p>I’ll have some posts looking at some specific demographic issues soon.  For instance, readers have insisted that one of the explanations for the drop in the murder rate or the rapid increase in real income or some other thing that occurred in the Clinton administration were due in part to demographics (murder to the number of young men, real income to those in their prime earning years, etc.).   The data only goes back to 1980, but we can check some of these assertions.  I predict that at least some of these assertions are not true.</p>
