                                                                    </div>

                                <p>When I read <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/04/clinton.libby/index.html">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Former President Bill Clinton blasted his successor&#8217;s decision to spare former White House aide I. Lewis &#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby from prison, telling Iowa radio listeners that Libby&#8217;s case differed from his own administration&#8217;s pardon controversy. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to understand, this is consistent with their philosophy,&#8221; Clinton said during an interview on Des Moines news-talk station WHO.  Bush administration officials, he said, &#8220;believe that they should be able to do what they want to do, and that the law is a minor obstacle.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I figured <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/05/clinton.libby/index.html">this</a> was coming:</p>
<blockquote><p>White House spokesman Tony Snow fired back at former President Bill Clinton after Clinton charged that the Bush administration believes the law is a &#8220;minor obstacle&#8221; in the &#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby case … In an op-ed piece in USA Today on Wednesday, Snow defended Bush&#8217;s action, charging that Clinton was &#8220;in a mad rush to push through pardons with dizzying haste &#8211; 141 grants on Clinton&#8217;s final day in office, part of 211 in the final nine weeks.&#8221; &#8230; Clinton&#8217;s flurry of last-minute pardons issued as he left office in 2001 &#8211; particularly his absolution of fugitive financier Marc Rich &#8211; sparked largely partisan outrage. Critics alleged that the pardon of Rich was linked to contributions raised for Clinton&#8217;s presidential library by Rich&#8217;s ex-wife.  Libby&#8217;s defenders have pointed to Democratic support for Clinton during that period to accuse critics of Bush&#8217;s commutation order of hypocrisy. Asked by a reporter if he was asserting that &#8220;two wrongs make a right,&#8221; Snow said: &#8220;Do we feel we&#8217;ve done wrong? Do we feel we cut corners? The answer is no.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The answer to the report’s <em><strong>actual</strong></em> question was yes &#8211; that precisely was Snow&#8217;s game here.  But two wrongs do not make a right.  Tony Snow, however, made up his own questions &#8211; and then lied.  The commutation of Libby’s jail time was a continuation of the cover-up of a very serious matter.  This Administration outed a CIA agent for purely partisan purposes.  That is clearly wrong.  And the cover-up is wrong.</p>
<p>I have never excused the pardon of Marc Rich.  In my opinion, that was wrong.  But that pardon is indeed different than the outing of a CIA agent &#8211; unless Marc Rich did out a CIA agent.  Did he?  If not, Tony Snow was being his usual horse’s a$$.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Since we will have to endure the stupid comments from the water carriers of this corrupt White House as to whether there was a crime or not, let me highlight what <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/07/were_crimes_committed.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> and <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/07/distinguished.php#comment-292352">Steve </a> said.  First – the key portion from Steve’s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The real issue is what Cheney knew and when he knew it. Libby&#8217;s lies were intentionally designed to keep Fitzgerald from getting a closer look at Cheney and determining what role Cheney had in the leak campaign and whether he knew Plame was covert. That&#8217;s why the obstruction was a big deal. That&#8217;s why no one was charged; the IIPA requires that you prove knowledge and Fitzgerald couldn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now Matt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of Libby&#8217;s defenders &#8211; George W. Bush, David Brooks, etc. &#8211; don&#8217;t seem to be denying that Libby committed a crime by lying under oath to investigators. They want us to say that, rather, he deserves to be treated very leniently because there was no big deal here. The alleged absence of an underlying crime is key to that theory. The converse theory is that there was an underlying crime and the crime can&#8217;t be proven because Libby lied to investigators. If that theory is wrong &#8211; if there really was no crime &#8211; then it seems we ought to get some kind of explanation from Libby as to why he lied &#8230; He&#8217;s not even trying to convince us that he had some other reason to lie.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course he isn’t.  This is incredibly simple.  Libby knows his boss set this whole thing in motion.  In other words, he knows Cheney is guilty as charged.  But he knows as does the White House that the only path to proving this in Court is through Libby.  So we have the deal.  Libby falls on the sword and Bush promises that Libby will not spend one day in jail.  Neat trick – eh?</p>

                                <p>A while back – Bruce Bartlett was so kind to email a link to his <a href="http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_12_01_01_bartlett.pdf">“Starve the Beast” Origins and Development of a Budgetary Metaphor</a>.  Within this history behind this phrase and how it has been (ab)used by certain politicians, I’ve been meaning to argue that Starve the Beast is not he correct metaphor for the modern Republican Party.  As <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/delong_economics_only/2007/07/jared-bernstein.html">Brad DeLong</a> objected to the latest from <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/07/on-charlatons-and-cranks.html">Greg Mankiw</a> (for somewhat different reasons than <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/cea-before-1966-credit-crunch-v-cea-in.html">my objection</a>, he points to a wonderful piece from a true small government conservative &#8211; <a href="http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1143">Alex Tabarrok</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I favor a much smaller government but I do not favor the Bush tax cut. Or, to be more precise, I would support a tax cut if one had been proposed. But so far President Bush has neither proposed nor implemented a tax cut &#8211; only a tax shift. To grasp the difference between a tax cut and a tax shift, we must first understand that what ultimately drives taxes is spending. If spending increases, as it has under the current administration, then sooner or later taxes must increase (or inflation, a type of tax, will go up). Milton Friedman, the libertarian-leaning Nobel prize-winning economist, has long reminded us to be suspicious of any tax cut not matched by a spending cut. If spending isn’t cut, then less taxes today means more taxes tomorrow. Thus, the Bush tax cut plan is really a plan for future tax increases … although Bush’s tax proposal does shift taxes away from capital (which, other things equal, would promote long-run economic growth), the mismatch between the tax cuts and spending increases means a rise in government borrowing to make up the difference. Some of this borrowing will come out of capital markets, thereby draining the source of private investment. Thus, on net, I don’t expect significant gains in long-run economic growth from these tax cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Bush Administration not only gave us a bloated prescription drug benefit program but has also increased defense spending.  Outside of Ron Paul (who will not get the GOP nomination for 2008) those GOP hopefuls to replace George W. Bush all seem to be calling for even more defense spending.  This includes especially Mitt Romney who has Greg Mankiw as one of his economic advisors.  While Bruce Bartlett and Alex Tabarrok may be advocating less government spending, the political leaders of the GOP are not really listening.  Credit goes to both Bruce Bartlett and Alex Tabarrok for understanding the implication of “big government conservatism” &#8211; to use the oxymoron once used by Fred Barnes – that this means taxes must go up for someone at sometime.  OK, Fred Barnes isn’t smart enough to get this but I would trust Greg Mankiw is.  </p>
<p>But let’s go back to what Bruce wrote to suggest the size of the government really is not what is at issue here.  Rather, it’s who should pay for this government.  Some key excerpts follow:</p>
<blockquote><p>The budgetary experience of recent years, in which Congress has enacted large tax cuts and large spending increases at the same time, has caused some former supporters of the starve-the-beast idea to reconsider their view. However, the metaphor remains a powerful one. In this article, I trace the origins and development of the idea and the reasons why it rose to prominence not just among policymakers, but among professional economists as well &#8230; The earliest recent use I have seen of the precise term starve the beast as it relates to the budget appeared in a Wall Street Journal news story in 1985. Reporter Paul Blustein quoted an unnamed White House official as lamenting that not enough had been done to cut spending during the Reagan administration. “We didn’t starve the beast,” the official said. “It’s still eating quite well &#8211; by feeding off future generations” &#8230; when the next Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, took office in 1953, he strenuously resisted efforts by Republicans in Congress to cut taxes. He insisted that balancing the budget had to take precedence, even though tax rates were extraordinarily high owing to the Korean War. As Eisenhower explained at a press conference on February 17, 1953, “Whether we are ready to face the job this minute or any other time, the fact is there must be balanced budgets before we are again on a safe and sound system in our economy. That means, to my mind, that we cannot afford to reduce taxes, reduce income, until we have in sight a program of expenditures that shows that the factors of income and of outgo will be balanced.  Now that is just to my mind sheer necessity” &#8230; Richard Nixon, Eisenhower’s vice president, continued this policy of resisting tax cuts and supporting tax increases after his election as president in 1968. One of his earliest actions in 1969 was to ask Congress for extension of the 1968 surtax, despite having promised during the campaign to allow it to expire on schedule … Gerald Ford, after succeeding Nixon in 1974, similarly resisted political pressure to cut taxes permanently, supporting only a temporary tax rebate in 1975, while asking for higher taxes on individuals and corporations and allowing inflation to raise taxes automatically as taxpayers were pushed into higher tax brackets and business depreciation allowances were eroded</p></blockquote>
<p>It is true that the Republican Party from the Eisenhower Administration to the Ford Administration did adhere to long-run fiscal restraint but something changed when Ronald Reagan began campaigning for the White House:</p>
<blockquote><p>In an influential article in early 1976, Wall Street Journal editorial writer Jude Wanniski blasted Ford for timidity in cutting taxes. He argued that the nation needed each political party to be a different type of Santa Claus &#8211; the Democrats being the spending Santa Claus and the Republicans being the tax-cutting Santa Claus. By refusing to play its proper role and instead being the party of the balanced budget, Republicans had hurt not only themselves, but the nation as a whole. Declared Wanniski: “The political tension in the marketplace of ideas must be between tax reduction and spending increases, and as long as Republicans have insisted upon balanced budgets, their influence as a party has shriveled, and budgets have been unbalanced.” &#8230; Writing on the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, which often sets the Republican agenda on economic policy, columnist Irving Kristol made clear the political connection between tax cuts and government spending. Tax cuts, he explained, are essential to shrinking the size of government. Republicans and conservatives, he said, “have learned the lesson of Proposition 13, which is that tax cuts are a prerequisite for cuts in government spending. The politics of the budgetary process is such that a cut in any particular program will provoke intense opposition from a minority, and only indifference from the majority. In such a case, it is unreasonable to expect politicians to pay the high political costs involved. They can only cut when they are seen to have no alternative”.  At this point, the circle had been largely squared. Instead of being viewed as the height of fiscal irresponsibility, cutting taxes without any corresponding effort to cut spending was now seen as the epitome of conservative fiscal policy. Trying to cut spending in isolation was both doomed to failure and counterproductive because<br />focusing attention on the deficit was more likely to lead to increasing taxes and thus expanding the size of government. The only way off the treadmill of higher spending leading to higher taxes leading to still more spending was to refuse to play the game.  Just cut taxes, the conservative intelligentsia now argued, and concern about deficits will be channeled into lower spending &#8230; During the 1980 campaign, Ronald Reagan endorsed the Kemp-Roth tax cut, but he also insisted that he would sharply cut government spending. Upon taking office in 1981, he followed through on this promise and asked Congress for spending cuts as  well as tax cuts &#8230; However, Reagan was unwilling to hold his tax cuts hostage to congressional inaction on spending. In explaining why tax cuts should precede spending cuts, he said that the former would pave the way for the latter, as the starve-the-beast theory posited.</p></blockquote>
<p>We should stop right here and simply note that Federal spending did not decline during the Reagan Administration.  But let’s return to what Bruce has to say about that 1993 debate over whether to raise taxes:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Capitol Hill as well, the modified starve-the-beast theory made inroads even among moderates who had previously supported tax increases to reduce budget deficits. After taking so much political heat, many members of Congress were apparently dismayed to see that so little progress was accomplished toward permanent resolution of the deficit problem. One of these legislators was Senator Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), who during floor debate on Bill Clinton’s proposed tax increase in 1993 said: “The history of the U.S. Government is that when we increased taxes, we spent them; we did not apply it to the deficit. It does not matter that the President has stated, ‘Let us have a deficit reduction trust fund.’ We have never followed that; we instead spent it.  I predict that if we raise these new taxes, we will spend them, also. We will not cut spending. We will spend it on new programs or expansion of existing programs”</p></blockquote>
<p>OK – but Federal spending as a share of GDP actually fell during the Clinton Administration.  Fast forward to the 2000 Presidential debate:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the 2000 presidential campaign, one of George W. Bush’s major themes was the need for a tax cut to reduce the budget surplus that had been accumulated during the Clinton administration. Again echoing the starve-the-beast theory, Bush argued against the virtues of a surplus, saying that it would only fuel additional spending &#8230; Despite the lack of evidence during the George W. Bush administration that tax cuts restrain spending increases, let alone cause spending to be cut, a number of leading conservative economists continue to insist on the basic correctness of the starve-the-beast theory, including Edward Lazear, who became chairman of the CEA under President Bush in May 2006 … many on the political left have long charged that the ultimate goal of starve-the-beast advocates has been to create a deficit so massive that entitlements &#8230; will have to be cut when a fiscal crisis finally emerges. In the words of Peter Beinart, editor of The New Republic: “It’s middle-class entitlements, however, such as Medicare and Social Security, which make the federal government so big (and so popular). And the GOP’s only hope of undermining them is to create a fiscal crisis so huge that now-unpopular Republican solutions, such as privatizing Social Security and turning Medicare into a voucher program, become politically feasible. In roughly a decade,<br />when multiple Bush tax cuts and an enormous defense buildup run smack into the baby-boom retirement, they might just get their wish” &#8230; This argument would have much more plausibility, however, if George W. Bush and a Republican Congress had not massively expanded Medicare spending in 2003 by adding a new prescription drug benefit to the program. Moreover, most Republican concern about federal spending these days tends to be channeled into demands that “pork-barrel” spending on public-works projects be curtailed, even though &#8211; perhaps because &#8211; it is a trivial component of overall spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>There you have a very good summary of the fiscal debate today.  While the GOP political leadership wants you to believe we can have this prescription drug benefit, larger defense budgets, and low tax rates simply by curbing pork-barrel spending – the numbers do not add up.  Even with fuzzy math – you can’t come close to justifying this kind of Bushian nonsense.  So what is the real agenda?  While big spending necessitates big taxes, this realism does not tell us who will ultimately pay all of these taxes.  Some conservatives who favor lower taxes on capital income are honest enough to propose other forms of taxation – such as Bruce’s idea to have a national Value-Added Tax.  </p>
<p>But most of the GOP political leadership is not as honest as Bruce.  They may prefer what I’ve called a Back Door Employment Tax Increase – that is, a cut in future Social Security benefits that exceeds any proposed reduction in payroll “contributions” and the alleged long-run Social Security shortfall.  While George W. Bush claims his privatization plan will make young workers better off, but simple finance tells us that this claim is nothing more than a big fat lie.  So the GOP leadership has decided to simply package this as “entitlement reform”.  And sadly, some economists including Greg Mankiw parrot these dishonest labels.  But let’s speak plain English – a plan to abuse the Social Security Trust Fund reserves to pay for cuts in taxes on capital income is a massive shift in taxation from capital income to employment income.  To do so by deception strikes me as Grand Larceny.  Of course, to tell young workers they’ll have to continue to pay high employment taxes as they get less in Social Security benefits could cost the GOP future elections.  Then again – robbers rarely call the bank president just before they decide to rob the bank.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post looks at the population 45 – 54 and how it changes over time, and whether that can explain some of the patterns in real median income we observe in Presidential administrations since Ike. Why population 45 – 54? Well, according to the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p08ar.html">Census</a>, that’s the income group making the most money. Thus, if demographics are the explanation for the extremely fast increase in real median income during the JFK/LBJ and Clinton administrations noted in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/real-median-income-by-presidential.html">my post on real median income</a>, presumably we’d expect to see much more of these prime-earning folks wandering around during those administrations than at other points. Similarly, given the drops in real median observed during the Carter, GHW, Nixon/Ford, and GW administrations, we’d expect to see a lower percentage of these high earning folks during those administrations. Of course, that’s all a big if.</p>
<p>Demographic data from 1980 to 2005 comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0011.xls">here</a>, and demographic data going back to 1952 was obtained from <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/pre-1980/PE-11.html">here</a>. Real median income also comes from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p07ar.html">Census </a>.</p>
<p>So here’s what the prime earning population as a percentage of the total population looks like over time.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RozyOTb6OBI/AAAAAAAAAYI/8JK1Dz1fsuc/s1600-h/Pop+45+-+54,+Graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RozyOTb6OBI/AAAAAAAAAYI/8JK1Dz1fsuc/s320/Pop+45+-+54,+Graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here’s a summary…</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RozcCjb6N-I/AAAAAAAAAXw/sVe-rYsyOd4/s1600-h/Pop+45+-+54,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RozcCjb6N-I/AAAAAAAAAXw/sVe-rYsyOd4/s320/Pop+45+-+54,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Well… Clinton did have a fastest growth rate in the high earning folks… so maybe some of his real median income performance is due to that. But he was followed by the Bush boys when it comes to growth rate in that prime earning demographic… and both were underperformers when it comes to real median income growth… and just about everything else we’ve looked at so far. JFK/LBJ, who posted the fasted growth rates in real median income, and Reagan, who followed JFK/LBJ and Clinton, both had decreases in this prime demographic.</p>
<p>It makes it hard to conclude that demographics are what’s driving the difference in performance we observed in real median income. A bit more formally…</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rozb8Tb6N9I/AAAAAAAAAXo/P04pwbhDIMI/s1600-h/Pop+45+-+54,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rozb8Tb6N9I/AAAAAAAAAXo/P04pwbhDIMI/s320/Pop+45+-+54,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And now a graph.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RozcIjb6N_I/AAAAAAAAAX4/fZ-TmdEst4A/s1600-h/Pop+45+-+54,+Graph+2.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RozcIjb6N_I/AAAAAAAAAX4/fZ-TmdEst4A/s320/Pop+45+-+54,+Graph+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So… is the excellent performance on real median income growth in the JFK/LBJ, Clinton, and to a lesser extent Reagan years explained by a veritable plethora of the prime demographic? Not much. Some of the dismal performance of Carter and Nixon/Ford might be due to a decrease in this prime demographic, but the Bush boys don’t even have that excuse. And if we look at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/this-post-looks-at-disposable-income-by.html">real disposable income less the increase in a person’s share of the national debt</a>, this demographic excuse gets even more shredded… </p>
<p>Conclusion… while real median income is affected a bit by demographics, its effect seems to be at the margin&#8230; when demographic conditions are abysmal, real median income growth rate is abysmal. But the performance of most Presidents doesn&#8217;t seem explainable by demographics.</p>

                                <p>In the wake of the recent attempted car bombings on London and Glasgow, reader Sammy sends along a link to <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=1038722007">this article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]e are confronted with the uneasy reality that our cosy assumptions about who becomes a terrorist and why have once again been shattered.</p>
<p>For most of us, the profile of the suicide bomber is not particularly complex: young, male (mostly), religiously devout, alienated, angry, disenfranchised, living on the edges of normal society, poorly integrated, and as a result, socially and psychologically outcast &#8211; what we assume is the perfect recipe for vulnerability to violent radicalisation.</p>
<p>But once again, and with more cases being uncovered across the country, these simplistic attributes we can only dismiss as naive and misleading. Evidence from research at the University of St Andrews tells us that not only has no terrorist profile been found, but that it is unlikely one ever will be. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We can easily identify what I have termed predisposing risk factors for involvement in terrorism. These include:</p>
<p>• Personal experiences of victimisation (which can be real or imagined);</p>
<p>• Expectations about involvement (for instance the lures &#8211; such as excitement, mission, sense of purpose &#8211; associated with being involved in any &#8220;insider&#8221; group and its various roles);</p>
<p>• Identification with a cause, frequently associated with some victimised community;</p>
<p>• Socialisation through friends or family, or being raised in a particular environment;</p>
<p>• Opportunity for expression of interest and steps towards involvement;</p>
<p>• Access to the relevant group.</p>
<p>It must be stated that individually none of these will ever help explain why people become terrorists but, taken in combination, they do provide a powerful framework for understanding why one person might become involved in terrorism and the other does not.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sammy goes on to note&#8230;</p>
<p>On the contrary, based on every spectacular terror attack on Western soil, and according to a former CIA operative who collected the life histories of almost 400 members of the <a href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/002391.php">deadly movement</a> :</p>
<blockquote><p>The stereotype that these terrorists are poor, desperate, single young men from Third World countries, vulnerable to brainwashing, is wrong, Dr. Marc Sageman told an international terrorism conference in Washington this week.</p>
<p>Most Arab terrorists he studied were well-educated, married men from middle- or upper-class families, in their mid-20s and psychologically stable, said Sageman, a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia . Many of them knew several languages and traveled widely.</p>
<p>But when they settled in foreign countries, they became lonely, homesick and embittered, he said. They felt humiliated by the weakness and backwardness of their homelands. They formed tight cliques with fellow Arabs and drifted into mosques more for companionship than for religion. Radical preachers convinced them it was their duty to drive Americans from Muslim holy lands, killing as many as possible. â€œ<br />â€œSageman served as a CIA case officer in Afghanistan from 1987 to 1989, running agents against the Soviet occupation. In a book, &#8220;Understanding Terror Networks,&#8221; published in May, he traced the roots of the movement to a centuries-old Islamic tradition dedicated to purifying Muslim lands of &#8220;infidels&#8221; and restoring the past glories of Islam.</p>
<p>He described al-Qaida and its global allies as &#8220;a violent Islamist social movement held together by an idea: the use of violence against foreign and non-Muslim governments or populations to establish an Islamist state in the core Arab region.&#8221;<br />For its members, terrorism is &#8220;an answer to Islamic decadence &#8211; a feeling that Islam has lost its way,&#8221; he said. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is backed up by a very <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=465570&#038;in_page_id=1770">authoritative source</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was a fanatic..I know their thinking, says former radical Islamist.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>I remember when we used to laugh in celebration whenever people on TV proclaimed that the sole cause for Islamic acts of terror like 9/11, the Madrid bombings and 7/7 was Western foreign policy. They also helped to draw away any critical examination from the real engine of our violence: Islamic theology. The foundation of extremist reasoning rest upon a model of the world in which your are either a believer or an infidel</p></blockquote>
<p>George Bush&#8217;s idealistic goal in Iraq is that freedom and democracy were the antidote to this. There is some logic <a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v49/i39/39b01001.htm">here</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[T]he only variable that was consistently associated with the number of terrorist was the Freedom House index of political rights and civil liberties. Countries with more freedom were less likely to be the birthplace of international terrorists. Poverty and literacy were unrelated to the number of terrorists from a country. Think of a country like Saudi Arabia : It is wealthy but has few political and civil freedoms. Perhaps it is no coincidence that so many of the September 11 terrorist and Osama bin Laden himself came from there.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, this seems like a longshot at this point.</p>
<p>If not stopped, the terrorists will get more and more powerful weapons, culminating with nuclear. Countries will be subjugated. How do we fight them?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>

                                <p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/07/on-charlatons-and-cranks.html">Greg Mankiw</a> reminds us of what he said back on <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/mankiw_speech_nabe_20030915.html">September 15, 2003</a> and adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking back after four years, I think this holds up pretty well.</p></blockquote>
<p>After arguing that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts had desirable short-term Keynesian aggregate demand effects, the speech goes into the alleged long-run supply-side benefits.  I was scratching my head thinking “crowding-out” and lo and behold we finally got to see this wisdom:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, the expansionary effects of the tax cuts will be offset to some degree by the effects of the budget deficits that arise from lower revenues. Deficits can raise interest rates and crowd out of investment, although I should note that the magnitude of this effect is much debated in the economics literature. The main problem now facing the U.S. economy is not high interest rates, but at some point continued deficits would matter and could impede growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we go back to what the Federal Reserve was thinking by late 2003, they were already increasing interest rates.  Why?  Because they thought we were about to have a revival of investment demand with or without the 2003 tax cuts.  We were also seeing an increase in defense spending from the Iraq debacle and were also seeing a push for a very expensive prescription drug benefit.  In a word, the fiscal triple whammy that so concerned the CEA back in late 1965.  Then it was the 1964 tax cut, Vietnam, and the Great Society.  The CEA warned President Johnson that if fiscal stimulus was not reversed, the Federal Reserve would likely raise interest rates and crowd-out investment.  But Dr. Mankiw continued in his speech with:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is why, as the President has said, spending restraint is so vital.  The Administration would prefer not to have deficits, but deficit reduction is only one of many goals. Reversing the tax cuts today, as some have suggested, would depress growth and job creation. This is a matter of priorities: In the face of a shrinking or barely growing economy, an investment slowdown, and continued job losses, the President made growth and jobs his number one economic priority. There are others who think he should make deficit management the top priority – but the Administration does not share that point of view. Deficits are worrisome, but not as worrisome as an economy that is not growing and is rapidly shedding jobs. It is also important to be aware of how these deficits arose. About half of the change in the fiscal outlook since the President took office is attributable to the weak economy, including the stock market. About a quarter is due to higher expenditures, mainly on homeland security and defense. The last quarter is due to reduced revenue from the tax cuts. And these estimates are based on static scoring, so they surely overstate the role of the tax cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounded more like drinking from the Kool Aid than stern advice to a President who seemed hell bent on fiscal irresponsibility.  In his own words, Greg Mankiw unwittingly admits that the fiscal advice in 2003 was not on par with the fiscal advice offered to President Johnson in late 1965.  Of course, that advice went largely unheeded back in the late 1960’s.</p>

                                <p>I woke up this morning to the 231st birthday of our nation and decided not to blog given the stain on this birthday from George W. Bush’s commutation of Scooter Libby.  Then I learned about what <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2007/07/04/Worldandnation/Bush_s_reprieve_for_L.shtml">Gus Bilirakis</a> had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>So far, however, only one congressional Republican from Florida, Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Palm Harbor, has publicly broken with party leaders and the president, saying Bush&#8217;s decision was wrong. Most of the others have just kept mum.&#8221; Mr. Libby was tried by a jury of his peers and was convicted of a felony,&#8221; Bilirakis said in a statement. &#8220;The fact that Mr. Libby committed this crime while serving as a public official makes it all the more egregious. Excessive or not, Mr. Libby&#8217;s sentence should be respected.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Good for Congressman Bilirakis!  </p>
<p>Let me take this opportunity to blast the press for repeating the following line ad nauseam (see for example <a href="http://www.charlottesvillenewsplex.tv/news/headlines/8303387.html">here</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush was under pressure from conservatives to pardon Lewis &#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby</p></blockquote>
<p>I have two problems with this oft repeated line: (1) it insults real conservatives; and (2) it confuses causes and effect.  On the first- there is a big difference between being a conservative and being a rightwing water carrier for this Machiavellian Administration. OK, most of these water carriers pretend they are conservatives.  But when I think of what a conservative would do in such situations, I think of the time when Senator Goldwater approached Richard Nixon and told it was time to resign from being President.  Congressman Bilirakis took a baby step in this direction but he’s no Goldwater.  And the fact that the rest of the GOP members of Congress have gone silent shows we have no Goldwaters today.  And don’t get me started on Mitt Romney or Fred Thompson who seem to think the outing of a CIA agent is in the finest of American traditions.  </p>
<p>But to suggest that these rightwing water carriers pressured Bush forgets who is giving the marching orders.  This Administration intended to do anything to cover-up its outing of a CIA agent.  And we heard the parade of lies from the likes of the water carriers over at the National Review from the git-go.  You recall: (1) there was no underlying crime; (2) Plame wasn’t a NOC; (3) it was all Richard Armitage’s fault: (3) Ms. Plame is a liberal Democrat; (4) Joe Wilson somehow lied.  We are still hearing the same old crap today.  It’s like Karl Rove wound up these talking puppets four years ago – and now that they have gotten out of control, he doesn’t know how to turn them off.  </p>
<p>No – the National Review and its ilk did not pressure Bush to do anything.  He had this in mind from day one of this scandal.  The job of the National Review has never been to advocate policy.   Rather its job is to act as Bush cheerleaders floating the trial balloons and setting the stage for the corrupt behavior of this Machiavellian Presidency.  Now one might ask why a group of conservatives would assist a Machiavellian Presidency.  But that’s a stupid question as the right wing water carriers of the National Review are not conservatives. </p>
<p>Do we have any hope as a nation returning to what our Founding Fathers envisioned.  I don’t know.  But if the GOP can shed its current corrupt leadership in favor of the likes of Gus Bilirakis – we may have a chance.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Fourth of July!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Did I say something about Mitt Romney?  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19586943">AP</a> says more:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who as Massachusetts governor refused to pardon an Iraq war veteran&#8217;s BB-gun conviction, on Tuesday called President Bush&#8217;s commutation of Scooter Libby&#8217;s prison sentence &#8220;reasonable.&#8221; &#8230; The prosecutor in the case &#8220;went after somebody even when he knew no crime had been committed,&#8221; Romney said. &#8220;Given that fact, isn&#8217;t it reasonable for a commutation of a portion of the sentence to be made?&#8221; &#8230; In his presidential bid, Romney often proudly points out that he was the first governor in modern Massachusetts history to deny every request for a pardon or commutation during his four years in office. He says he refused pardons because he didn&#8217;t want to overturn a jury. During the four years Romney was in office, 100 requests for commutations and 172 requests for pardons were filed in the state. All were denied.</p></blockquote>
<p>Romney is not only a hypocrite but also one who seems to think the outing of a CIA is AOK (“no crime had been committed”).</p>

                                <p>On June 15th an F-16 crashed north of Baghdad.</p>
<p>I remember thinking that another family would be in mourning.</p>
<p>My mother called me two days later – the pilot was a resident of the small village where I was born and raised. His family farm is about two miles from our former family homestead.</p>
<p>Kevin was 13 younger than me, so I didn’t know him, but I knew his parents (not well) and his extended family. He was a Delta Airlines pilot, a Lt. Colonel in the Ohio Air Guard, and he always made time in the spring and fall for planting and harvest on the family farm.</p>
<p>The little village has had other tragedies over the years, and has always pulled together and recovered. During WW II the little village of 350 people lost 7 men KIA, which seems horrific to me, and I hear it was.</p>
<p>The churches and the American Legion Post are the bedrock of the community, and those groups will help the community stay upright and move on. The Legion has been a major force in the community since the post WW II years.</p>
<p>Seven times in the last decade I have stood in various small town cemeteries, tried not to flinch at the rifle volleys and failed to stay dry-eyed during Taps. Those ceremonies though were different, the veterans were carried to their rest by their grandchildren and great-grandchildren after long and full lives.</p>
<p>This is not the day to rant about the war, whether it is right or wrong, but a day to wonder at the courage of those few who stand watch over all of us, without question, and then to feel a bit of the sadness of the families and friends.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Presented without comment, the unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature&#8217;s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
<p>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</p>
<p>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>
<p>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</p>
<p>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>
<p>He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</p>
<p>He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</p>
<p>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</p>
<p>He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.</p>
<p>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p>
<p>He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.</p>
<p>He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.</p>
<p>He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.</p>
<p>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:</p>
<p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>
<p>For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:</p>
<p>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</p>
<p>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:</p>
<p>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:</p>
<p>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:</p>
<p>For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies</p>
<p>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:</p>
<p>For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p>
<p>He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.</p>
<p>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p>
<p>He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &#038; Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</p>
<p>He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.</p>
<p>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</p>
<p>In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>
<p>Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</p>
<p>We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. — And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor</p>

                                <p>The LA Times has a story on the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-na-private4jul04,0,5808980.story?coll=la-home-center">outsourcing of the Iraq War</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The number of U.S.-paid private contractors in Iraq now exceeds that of American combat troops, newly released figures show, raising fresh questions about the privatization of the war effort and the government&#8217;s capacity to carry out military and rebuilding campaigns.</p>
<p>More than 180,000 civilians — including Americans, foreigners and Iraqis — are working in Iraq under U.S. contracts, according to State and Defense department figures obtained by the Los Angeles Times. </p>
<p>Including the recent troop buildup, 160,000 soldiers and a few thousand civilian government employees are stationed in Iraq.</p>
<p>The total number of private contractors, far higher than previously reported, shows how heavily the Bush administration has relied on corporations to carry out the occupation of Iraq — a mission criticized as being undermanned.</p>
<p>&#8220;These numbers are big,&#8221; said Peter Singer, a Brookings Institution scholar who has written on military contracting. &#8220;They illustrate better than anything that we went in without enough troops. This is not the coalition of the willing. It&#8217;s the coalition of the billing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The numbers include at least 21,000 Americans, 43,000 foreign contractors and about 118,000 Iraqis — all employed in Iraq by U.S. tax dollars, according to the most recent government data.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m actually quite OK with the idea of hiring Iraqis&#8230; they&#8217;re there and pretty inexpensive.</p>
<p>However&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>But there are also signs that even those mounting numbers may not capture the full picture. Private security contractors, who are hired to protect government officials and buildings, were not fully counted in the survey, according to industry and government officials.</p>
<p>Continuing uncertainty over the numbers of armed contractors drew special criticism from military experts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have control of all the coalition guns in Iraq. That&#8217;s dangerous for our country,&#8221; said William Nash, a retired Army general and reconstruction expert. The Pentagon &#8220;is hiring guns. You can rationalize it all you want, but that&#8217;s obscene.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The article continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>But critics worry that troops and their missions could be jeopardized if contractors, functioning outside the military&#8217;s command and control, refuse to make deliveries of vital supplies under fire. </p>
<p>At one point in 2004, for example, U.S. forces were put on food rations when drivers balked at taking supplies into a combat zone.</p>
<p>Adding an element of potential confusion, no single agency keeps track of the number or location of contractors.</p>
<p>In response to demands from Congress, the U.S. Central Command began a census last year of the number of contractors working on U.S. and Iraqi bases to determine how much food, water and shelter was needed.</p>
<p>That census, provided to The Times under the Freedom of Information Act, shows about 130,000 contractors and subcontractors of different nationalities working at U.S. and Iraqi military bases.</p>
<p>However, U.S. military officials acknowledged that the census did not include other government agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department.</p></blockquote>
<p>Excuse me?  The number doesn&#8217;t include the State Department?  </p>
<p>And how about the contractors?  How many sub-contractors do they have?</p>
<blockquote><p>The companies with the largest number of employees are foreign firms in the Middle East that subcontract to KBR, the Houston-based oil services company, according to the Central Command database. KBR, once a subsidiary of Halliburton Co., provides logistics support to troops, the single largest contract in Iraq.</p>
<p>Middle Eastern companies, including Kulak Construction Co. of Turkey and Projects International of Dubai, supply labor from Third World countries to KBR and other U.S. companies for menial work on U.S. bases and rebuilding projects. Foreigners are used instead of Iraqis because of fears that insurgents could infiltrate projects.</p></blockquote>
<p>What about the Blackwater types?</p>
<blockquote><p>The most controversial contractors are those working for private security companies, including Blackwater, Triple Canopy and Erinys. They guard sensitive sites and provide protection to U.S. and Iraqi government officials and businessmen.</p>
<p>Security contractors draw some of the sharpest criticism, much of it from military policy experts who say their jobs should be done by the military. On several occasions, heavily armed private contractors have engaged in firefights when attacked by Iraqi insurgents.</p>
<p>Others worry that the private security contractors lack accountability. Although scores of troops have been prosecuted for serious crimes, only a handful of private security contractors have faced legal charges.</p>
<p>The number of private security contractors in Iraq remains unclear, despite Central Command&#8217;s latest census. The Times identified 21 security companies in the Central Command database, deploying 10,800 men. </p>
<p>However, the Defense Department&#8217;s Motsek, who monitors contractors, said the Pentagon estimated the total was 6,000.</p>
<p>Both figures are far below the private security industry&#8217;s own estimate of about 30,000 private security contractors working for government agencies, nonprofit organizations, media outlets and businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given how much outright disinformation we&#8217;ve been provided about this war so far, my bet is that even these FOIA numbers are waaay understated, even taking into account that they don&#8217;t include State Dep&#8217;t figures.</p>
