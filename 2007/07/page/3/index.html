                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I had a post this morning looking at the evolution of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-national-debt.html">real debt per capita and debt as a percent of GDP</a> over time, focusing on changes by Presidential administration.  </p>
<p>The graph, which went back to 1952, showed that all the Presidents in the sample except St. Ronald the Reagan, GHW, and GW managed to decrease the debt.  It was suggested that perhaps this was due to business cycles.  Regular readers this was also given as a possible reason for an earlier series of posts in which it was shown that for whatever reason, growth in real GDP per capita tends to be higher under Dem administrations than under Rep administrations.  Regular readers know I also went through a whole series of posts showing that even taking the business cycle into account, that wasn&#8217;t the explanation.</p>
<p>So I want to address the issue when it comes to debt as well&#8230; but I really don&#8217;t want to have to write a whole bunch of posts on this one issue.  I figured I&#8217;d do something a bit different this time&#8230; I took one of the graphs from the earlier post on debt, and I added in periods for which there was a recession (in black).  </p>
<p>Periods for which there was a <a href="http://nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">recession</a>:</p>

<p>Real GDP per capita since 1952</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqlFHUPDHoI/AAAAAAAAAfw/LYXnYDsNijU/s1600-h/recessions+since+1952.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqlFHUPDHoI/AAAAAAAAAfw/LYXnYDsNijU/s320/recessions+since+1952.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I tried to put a black bar in wherever there was a recession during the fiscal year &#8211; hopefully I didn&#8217;t screw up.  (Recall&#8230; fiscal years ran through June until 1976, and through September thereafter.)  I realize that in some years, the recession lasted all year, and in some years, it was over quickly, but this was the best I could do on a graph.</p>
<p>Assuming I didn&#8217;t screw up, it really doesn&#8217;t look like recessions are the reason debt increased under the 3 fiscally irresponsible presidents.  Granted, all three of them had recessions early in their term, but they kept driving up the debt long after the recession ended.  Besides, JFK/LBJ and Nixon/Ford both had recessions early in their terms, and managed to decrease the debt.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>BTW&#8230; Data on debt comes from OMB Table <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist07z1.xls">White House OMB Table 7.1</a> &#8211; the figure used was debt held by the public.  Where the debt was made “real” and “per capita”, inflation was calculated from <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI figures</a> and population came from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">BEA NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  CPI figures used were average for the fiscal year, and population figures were for the quarter the fiscal year ended.  (Note that the fiscal year ended in June until 1976, and in September thereafter.)</p>

                                <p>Wal-Mart is moving through the midwest converting stores to “super-centers.”</p>
<p>A super-center includes an auto service shop and full service grocery.</p>
<p>“Converting” is really the wrong word, because W-M almost always builds a new store and abandons the prior building.</p>
<p>And what happens to the abandoned building?  In most communities no business needs that  much square footage, so it sits empty. And sits. And sits. And creates a ghost center, if not an eyesore.</p>
<p>Where are the trial lawyers when we need them?</p>

                                <p>This post looks at national debt by presidency. (Long time readers may recall I did this <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/national-debt-by-presidency.html">once before</a>, back in the day before I figured out how to put graphs up on blogger.)</p>
<p>Data on debt comes from OMB Table <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist07z1.xls">White House OMB Table 7.1</a> &#8211; the figure used was debt held by the public. Where the debt was made “real” and “per capita”, inflation was calculated from <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI figures</a> and population came from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">BEA NIPA Table 7.1</a>. CPI figures used were average for the fiscal year, and population figures were for the quarter the fiscal year ended. (Note that the fiscal year ended in June until 1976, and in September thereafter.)</p>
<p>Here’s real debt per capita…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiLN0PDHkI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/FlCWzntUK30/s1600-h/debt+-+graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiLN0PDHkI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/FlCWzntUK30/s320/debt+-+graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here’s debt as a percentage of GDP.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiLGEPDHjI/AAAAAAAAAfI/Sjs-rBw0-ps/s1600-h/debt+-+graph+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiLGEPDHjI/AAAAAAAAAfI/Sjs-rBw0-ps/s320/debt+-+graph+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>A couple summary tables…</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiKvkPDHiI/AAAAAAAAAfA/gNA__XDvR88/s1600-h/debt+-+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiKvkPDHiI/AAAAAAAAAfA/gNA__XDvR88/s320/debt+-+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiKp0PDHhI/AAAAAAAAAe4/n7DPCeTs52A/s1600-h/debt+-+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiKp0PDHhI/AAAAAAAAAe4/n7DPCeTs52A/s320/debt+-+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So, what do we see… In terms of real debt per capita, Clinton was the big debt decreaser, distantly followed by Ike, himself distantly followed by Nixon/Ford and Carter and JFK/LBJ. Bringing up the shameful rear, the only 3 Presidents to increase the size of real debt per person were GW, GHW, and St. Ronald the Reagan.</p>
<p>When it came to cutting debt as a percentage of GDP, Clinton came first, followed by JFK/LBJ, Ike, Nixon/Ford and Carter. (JFK/LBJ did better by this count because real GDP per capita grew so quickly in that period.) Once again, GW, GHW, and especially St. Ronald the Reagan were the three fiscally irresponsible presidents, being the only ones who increased the size of the debt. </p>
<p>Is debt a bad thing? Well&#8230; it depends&#8230; driving up the national debt is like driving up a person&#8217;s debt &#8211; its fine if its a temporary thing, and it leads to greater growth. (E.g., borrowing to go to school can be fiscally responsible if it will lead to a high paying career.) But unfortunately, it <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_19.html">does not appear that this has been the case for Reagan, GHW and GW</a>.</p>
<p>Some will also protest that the President is merely a bystander when it comes to debt, and Congress is the culprit. Its true that Congress is an enabler, but the President submits the budget. Besides&#8230; take a look at the graphs&#8230; do the patterns seem to change when Congress changes, or when the President changes?</p>
<p>And one more thing&#8230; Presidents talk about their effect on the debt. The very first item on the list of <em>Major Policy Initiatives</em> on GW&#8217;s Economic Blueprint (released February 28, 2001) was <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">Pay Down the Federal Debt</a>. In fact, it has this nifty graph&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiPAkPDHlI/AAAAAAAAAfY/gGe4oy7ze4U/s1600-h/debt+-+GW%27s+Economic+Blueprint+Chart.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiPAkPDHlI/AAAAAAAAAfY/gGe4oy7ze4U/s320/debt+-+GW%27s+Economic+Blueprint+Chart.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And we are told this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, the President&#8217;s Budget pays down the debt so aggressively that it runs into an unusual problem—its annual surpluses begin to outstrip the amount of maturing debt starting in 2007. This means that the United States will be effectively unable to retire any more debt than what is assumed in the Administration&#8217;s Budget over the next 10 years—the President achieves &#8220;maximum possible debt retirement&#8221; in his budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>And now an editorial comment / daily installment of Bush Derangement Syndrome&#8230; can GW&#8217;s failures on the debt be excused by 9/11, the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the end of the tech bubble? I don&#8217;t think so&#8230; JFK/LBJ inherited a recession and fought a war &#8211; it was also fought in an undeveloped country, but not only did they have to contend with insurgents, they had to contend with a regular army, and both were trained and supplied by a super power. Nixon fought the same war, and had to contend with an oil embargo at the same time. Both managed to cut the debt, and JFK/LBJ produced far, far more impressive growth in real GDP per capita to boot. </p>

<p>The GAO projects greater deficit spending for state and local governments in <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d071080sp.pdf">this report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For over a decade GAO has run long-term simulations showing that absent a change in policy, the combined effects of demographic changes and growing health care costs drive ever-increasing federal deficits and debt levels. The Comptroller General has repeatedly warned that the current fiscal path of the federal government is “imprudent and unsustainable”. State and local governments provide an array of services to their residents, and the federal government relies on these governments to assist in the realization of national goals. State and local governments also rely on federal grants to varying extents. These subnational governments may also face fiscal stress. To provide Congress and the public with a broader national context, GAO has developed a fiscal model of the state and local sector.<br />The GAO state and local model projects the level of receipts and expenditures of the sector in future years based on current and historical spending and revenue patterns. In the “base case” model we assume that the current set of policies in place across federal, state, and local governments remains constant. The primary data source for the model is the National Income and Product Accounts. The timeframe for the simulations parallels that of our federal fiscal model—the simulations extend until 2050. The state and local model examines the aggregate fiscal outcomes for the sector and does not examine the condition of any individual state or local government.</p></blockquote>
<p>The report has a picture:</p>

<p>Selling assets is becoming a trend to fund the requirements of sub-national governments, especially highways at the moment, and water resources for things like bottled water, which generates large profits. That is for another post, but is a reflection of a trend of declining revenue</p>
<p>There is another trend in WTO GATS agreements that also undercuts local and state functions of regulating for public good. Of course, our own system is built on Federalism.</p>
<p>WTO GATS agreements VI.4 stress treating much of what we have financed publicly as commodities, with particular kind of market rules.</p>
<p><em>&#8216;National treatment&#8217;</em> is a benchmark for eliminating sub-national regulation of trade, meaning highways, water resources, electricity etc, US corporations are used to operating with different sets of state rules, and of course seek consistency. But GATS rules make challenges to any local rule much easier by anyone in the world who has a corporation, and domestic company advantages in commodities like water are removed.</p>
<p><em>&#8216;market efficiency&#8217;</em> Within the frame, local regulation can be challenged in the name of restricting market operations. Comparative advantage is sort of smoothed out.</p>
<p><em>&#8216;least burdensome regulation&#8217;</em>, and<br />If one state&#8217;s rules are stricter than another, the stricter regulations can be challenged on this basis. Domestic rules for an industry become less relevant.</p>
<p><em>&#8216;objective criterion&#8217;</em>. Public Utility Commissions often have unstated assumptions about public good and such, so will be restricted to only defined and replicable criterion.</p>
<p>How does this play out in the real world? And who plays?</p>

                                <p>Reader Dan follows up the posts earlier this week on suicide by finding <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/06/11/vets.suicide/index.html">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The risk of suicide among male U.S. veterans is double that of the general population, according to a study published Monday. </p>
<p>&#8220;We need to be more alert to the problem of suicide as a major public health issue and we need to do better screening among individuals who have served in the military, probe for their mental health risk as well as gun availability,&#8221; said Dr. Mark S. Kaplan, professor of community health at Portland State University in Oregon, lead author of the study in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.</p>
<p>For 12 years, Kaplan and his team of researchers followed more than 104,000 veterans who had served in the armed forces at some time between 1917 and 1994 and compared them with more than 216,000 non-veterans.</p>
<p>In all, between 1986 and 1997, 508 of them committed suicide &#8212; 197 veterans and 311 non-veterans.</p>
<p>After adjusting for a host of potentially compounding factors, including age, time of service and health status, the study showed that those who had been in the military were 2.13 times more likely to die of suicide over time.</p>
<p>At biggest risk were veterans who were white, those who had gone to college and those with activity limitations, according to the study, which was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
<p>&#8216;Life is too complex&#8217;<br />Still, Kaplan would not say that the study proves that military service itself results in an increased risk of suicide. &#8220;I never feel comfortable claiming a causal relationship,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Life is too complex.&#8221;</p>
<p>No surprise was the finding that veterans were more likely to use guns to end their lives than were their non-veteran counterparts.</p>
<p>One unanticipated finding was that being overweight appeared to confer protection from suicide by more than 50 percent, the study found.</p>
<p>Kaplan cited a paucity of data on the subject, but said it might have to do with the fact that people who are underweight are more likely to smoke, and smokers are more likely to be depressed.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>British concerns did not appear to &#8220;materially&#8221; affect US actions in its &#8220;war on terror&#8221;, the UK&#8217;s intelligence and security committee has said. <br />The committee, which reports to the prime minister, was probing possible UK involvement in rendition flights. </p>
<p>It said America&#8217;s &#8220;lack of regard&#8221; for UK concerns had &#8220;serious implications&#8221; for future intelligence relations. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The committee said the UK services &#8220;used caveats specifically prohibiting any action being taken&#8221; when they handed over the intelligence on the men. </p>
<p>It says the UK security services did not foresee that the US authorities would disregard the caveats, given that they had honoured the caveat system for the past 20 years. </p>
<p>&#8220;This case shows a lack of regard on the part of the US for UK concerns &#8211; despite strong protests &#8211; and that has serious implications for the intelligence relationship,&#8221; the report concluded. </p>
<p>&#8220;In fighting international terrorism it is clear that the US will take whatever action it deems is necessary, within US law, to protect its national security,&#8221; it said. </p>
<p>&#8220;Although the US may take note of UK protests and concerns, it does not appear materially to affect their strategy; the rendition programme has revealed aspects of this usually close relationship that are surprising and concerning,&#8221; the report warned. </p></blockquote>
<p>Note&#8230; this is the UK.  Perhaps our closest ally.  What does it say about people when even their closest allies have misgivings about cooperating with them?</p>

                                <p>A couple of years ago, we paid <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/economists-enabling-tax-cheats-why.html">tribute</a> to <a href="http://www.epinet.org/newsroom/releases/2005/04/050411_McIntyre.pdf">Bob McIntyre</a> and to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591840198/qid=1113517951/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-4414318-7674360">David Cay Johnston</a> for recognizing how U.S. based multinationals can abuse the transfer pricing regulations to shift income abroad to low-tax jurisdictions.  Johnston’s <em>Letter to Switzerland</em> chapter focused on how Big Pharma plays this game.</p>
<p>An international tax guru might fire back that Big Pharma eventually pays taxes when the profits are repatriated.  OK, these companies get to defer taxation and the present value of $1 million in tax paid in 10 years is a lot less than the $1 million without the deferral benefit.  But this gets better as reported today by The New York Times:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Two years ago, when companies received a big tax break to bring home  their offshore profits, the president and Congress justified it as a one-time tax amnesty that would create American jobs.  Drug makers were the biggest beneficiaries of the amnesty program, repatriating about $100 billion in foreign profits and paying only minimal taxes. But the companies did not create many jobs in return. Instead, since 2005 the American drug industry has laid off tens of thousands of workers in this country.  And now drug companies are once again using complex strategies, many of them demonstrably legal, to shelter billions of dollars in profits in international tax havens, according to their financial statements and independent tax experts.  In one popular accounting move, companies declare their foreign markets as far more profitable than their American businesses &#8211; even though drug prices are typically higher in the United States than anywhere else in the world.  Drug makers are not the only American multinationals using tax loopholes to declare large portions of their income beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. The Brookings Institution estimates that multinational companies are using overseas tax shelters to lower their payments to the Treasury by about $50 billion a year. But the drug industry accounts for one of the biggest portions of that shortfall, according to the I.R.S. and independent tax experts. And the nature of their business gives drug makers techniques, like sheltering valuable pharmaceutical patents in tax-friendly havens like Ireland, that many other industries cannot use. Moreover, the sheer heft of the American drug industry, which had about $60 billion in pretax profits last year, can give disproportionate weight to the economic impact of its tax sheltering techniques. Even though the tax amnesty legislation has expired, its passage encouraged companies to be even more aggressive about sheltering money, expecting another holiday in the future, said H. David Rosenbloom, director of the international tax program at New York University. Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation, which passed with sizable majorities in October 2004. &#8221;Congress can swear on two stacks of Bibles that it&#8217;ll never do it again,&#8221; Mr. Rosenbloom said, &#8221;but they&#8217;ve lost their virginity.&#8221; With a few narrow exceptions, the drug companies are supposed to be paying as much as 35 percent of their worldwide profits in United States federal taxes. In reality they pay much less. Last year, for example Eli Lilly, the sixth-largest American drug maker, paid less than 6 percent of its profits of $3.4 billion to the United States government, according to its financial statement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some rough numbers on Eli Lilly’s profits and income taxes.  Last year, its pretax income was $3.42 billion and this story is saying that its US taxes were about $0.21 billion?  If their US tax rate was 35%, then their US income was only $0.6 billion with $2.82 billion declared in foreign affiliates.  Its total income taxes were about $0.76 billion so foreign income taxes were running around $0.55 billion.  The effective tax rate on non-US income was therefore less than 20%, while the overall tax rate was around 22%.  It does sound like this company – like a lot of other Big Pharma companies – is parking a lot of profits abroad. And it’s not exactly the case that foreign markets provide more monopoly protection as compared to the US market.  So it does seem to be a case where massive transfer pricing manipulation is occurring.</p>
<p>And they get this repatriation on the cheap because of the tax break we gave them a couple of years ago.  Why on earth did President Bush and certain members of Congress think that this large tax giveaway would create more American jobs?  Were they talking about jobs with tax law firms and accounting firms?</p>

                                <p>By way of <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/07/25/nonny-mouse-goes-down-under/">Crooks and Liars </a>comes an article about our declining international tourism industry. This article is a personal account of stopping in the US as the author travels from London to New Zealand.<br />The first paragraph is the econ specifics:</p>
<blockquote><p>The travel and tourist industry is one of the United State’s biggest money-makers, generating $103 billion in tax revenue every year. Without this tax revenue, every American household would pay nearly $1,000 more in taxes every a year. But while the travel business is flourishing internationally, tourism to America has been on a steep decline, dropping 36 percent between 1992 and 2005, with a loss of $43 billion in 2005 alone. The nation’s international tourism balance of trade declined more than 70 percent over the past 10 years &#8211; from $26.3 billion in 1996 to $7.4 billion in 2005. </p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t stop there. Read about how the author&#8217;s fellow passengers were cataloged via photo and finger prints even though they were not visiting the USA. They were just stopping over for fuel. Is it any wonder we are seeing such a decline in tourism? One passenger summed it up:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8216;You bloody Yanks seem to think terrorism is something new and only ever happens to Americans,’ he groused to me&#8230; ‘We’ve had the IRA and the French have the Algerians and the Spanish have ETA. Now you know what the rest of Europe’s been living with for the last few hundred years. Why don’t you lot just grow up?’</p></blockquote>
<p>I know our reputation in the world has become suspect via what is reported, but people with first hand accounts such as what these passengers experienced I would assume are more probative when judging us.  What these passengers experienced is the results of setting policy as driven by paranoia.   I personally do not want to be associated with such a mind set.  At the same time, what the heck happened to all that we learned from  the focus on paranoia and it&#8217;s harm in the 60&#8217;s?  I can recall many bands having songs about it as we became aware of how it was driving policy then.  This is one of my favorites:<br /><a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/grand-funk-railroad-paranoid-lyrics.html">Grand Funk Paranoid</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Did you ever have that feeling in your life That someone was watching you? You don&#8217;t have no reason that&#8217;s right But still he&#8217;s there watching you Someone is waiting just outside the door To take you away</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The Big 3 and the United Auto Workers start talks this week, with the futures of the companies and the union at stake. No pressure there!</p>
<p>A massive issue is legacy costs, both retirements and healthcare, especially healthcare. The UAW played a huge role in securing healthcare benefits for American workers.</p>
<p>Both sides made massive promises when the Big 3 had 80%+ of the domestic market, those days are long gone. The Big 3 claim that these “legacy” costs amount to $25 per current labor hour, a huge add-on burden.</p>
<p>The UAW has three constituencies:</p>
<p>1) active workers<br />2) retirees who are not yet Medicare age (at greatest risk)<br />3) retirees who are Medicare age</p>
<p>Only the active workers can vote on a new contract, so the Big 3 will play the workers against the retirees. UAW officials are in a really tough spot.</p>
<p>(There was and is a presumption that many blue collar workers often cannot physically work their jobs until the age of 65, which I believe remains true.)</p>
<p>A recent proposal is for the UAW to take over the retiree benefits through a Voluntary Employee Benefit Association, known as a VEBA [IRS Code Section 501 c (9)].</p>
<p>This would do the following:<br />a) shift the risk and management to the UAW (major burden)<br />b) protect the retirees in case of a bankruptcy filing (huge benefit)</p>
<p>The UAW would inevitably have to cut retiree benefits, which will not play well with the retirees, although something is usually better than nothing.</p>
<p>This whole deal may be moot because the Big 3 may not have enough cash to fund the present value of the benefit stream, The numbers are HUGE.</p>
<p>(Ford is continuing to rack up losses, look for a sale or bankruptcy within two years.)</p>
<p>This is unlikely to set a precedent for the future, the number of companies making such promises has diminished  (and many deals have been flushed through Chapter 11).</p>
<p>What will happen in the future to blue collar workers who cannot do their jobs until they qualify for Medicare coverage?</p>
<p>Will a creative solution be found? Will there be a strike on this or other issues? Can a union operate such a complex insurance entity?  Will current UAW workers throw the retirees over board? Stay tuned.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Given the recent post on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-suicide-rate.html">suicide rates over time</a> and how its changed over various presidential administrations, Reader Dan finds <a href="http://www.sprc.org/library/SuicideTrends2.pdf">this presentation</a> (warning &#8211; PDF file). Its worth a look. Here are its conclusions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suicide rates declined over the 20-year period.<br />• The decline was led largely by declines in firearm<br />suicides.<br />• Elder and youth suicide rates have declined;<br />suicide among the middle-aged has not.<br />• Declines have been strongest among Black,<br />Hispanic, and Asian Americans.<br />• The declines of the 1990s have stalled or reversed<br />in the early 2000s for all age groups except elders.<br />• Recent increases are largely among suffocation suicides.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not that I&#8217;m contemplating suicide myself or anything, but it seems to me that suffocation has got to be one of the least pleasant ways to go.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of us will end up going that way &#8211; suicide by suffocation&#8230; but it won&#8217;t make the suicide figures. By that I mean&#8230; many of us have medical directives (and have spoken to our loved ones) that if we&#8217;re in a vegetative state, we aren&#8217;t to be resuscitated and no extraordinary procedures are to be used to keep us alive. Many would pick euthanasia in those circumstances, if given a choice, but the choice doesn&#8217;t exist &#8211; in large part because people who talk a lot about how important it is for the government to stay out of people&#8217;s business seem to think its important for the government to meddle in the most important business a person has. So the choice we&#8217;re allowed is whether to linger for a very long time and die in a very undignified fashion, or to linger for a few days and die in a very undignified fashion.</p>
<p>I remember some years back when my grandmother, after years of failing health, was slowly dying in the hospital. On top of it all, she had Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and hadn&#8217;t been herself for several years. (On the one or two occasions over the past few years where she had been lucid if only for a moment, her disgust over the Alzheimer&#8217;s was palpable.) So she was in a hospital, with tubes down her throat, in pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>My grandfather (they had been married almost 75 years) couldn&#8217;t bear the idea of letting her go, and insisted that doctors do everything they could to keep her alive. My mother and my aunt (the two children of that marriage) begged him to let her die &#8211; the pain she was in obvious, and heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Finally, my sister spoke to my grandfather. My sister, who had undergone heart surgery several times knew what it was like to have a tube down her throat. She explained that even under sedation, even unconscious, you feel that tube. The tube is un-natural, and every instinct you have is to get that tube out, to claw it out if you have to. But you can&#8217;t, because you can&#8217;t move.</p>
<p>My sister told him &#8211; &#8220;You are condemning her to the worst feeling you can impose on her for as long as she lives. Its not like she&#8217;s in surgery or recovering from something, in which case it would be justified. She&#8217;s never going to come out of this.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to report that my grandfather agreed to have the tube removed. Bad as the choice was &#8211; allowing my grandmother to starve or suffocate, whichever came first &#8211; the alternative was worse, but those were the only choices the government would allow.</p>
