<blockquote><p>The last go-round in the Gulf produced at least three spectacular domestic terrorists: Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols (Oklahoma City) and John Mohammed (DC sniper killings). Both McVeigh and Mohammed were reported to be unbalanced by their experience during the Gulf War. </p>
<p>The levels of stress on our troops is quite high. Combine this with the continuing spread of anti-government ideologies through terrorism-related conspiracy theories and the encouraging (or at least failure to suppress) of activities like vigilante border patrols which combine racism with xenophobia.</p>
<p>Iraq will be &#8216;The Timothy McVeigh Finishing School&#8217;.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope he&#8217;s wrong.</p>

<p><a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/opinion/24brooks.html&#038;OQ=_rQ3D1Q26hp&#038;OP=202a54b5Q2F)Q5Dwu)FQ3DeQ7BQ7BF)Q25xx6)x6)Q25,)Q7B84p4Q7Bp)Q25,ueQ7BQ7BoQ3DAfF2G">David Brooks</a> entitles his latest spin <em>A Reality-Based Economy</em> and opens with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The neopopulist story line about skyrocketing inequality and the tides of globalization is incredibly simple-minded.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I’ve seen many folks smarter than me on this issue say that inequality is rising but none have used the word skyrocketing.  And I’m not sure what tides of globalization even means.  But the real problem with this spin – as pointed out by <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=07&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=david_brooks_sets_record_for_m">Dean Baker</a> &#8211; is how much misinformation Brooks has to use to write his 750 word piece of nonsense.  Let’s take my favorite:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brooks says &#8220;after a lag, average wages are rising sharply. Real average wages rose by 2 percent in 2006, the second fastest rise in 30 years.&#8221; The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average hourly wage is 1.2 percent higher than its year ago level and still below its December 2002 level. That&#8217;s almost five years of zero growth. In the late 90s, real wages were growing 1.6 percent annually.</p></blockquote>
<p>The skyrocketing real wage canard seems to have become a favorite among the rightwing.  Since I’ve been looking for some excuse to update a graph of real wages among production and nonsupervisory workers, Dean’s correction of this latest spin from David Brooks is a great opportunity.  Our graph doesn’t show a lag but rather a decline.  The latest increase in real wages – as measured from June 2006 to June 2007 – is only 1.2% as Dean suggests.  OK – if one measures this from January 2006 to January 2007, you get a higher increase.  I guess David Brooks has been asleep for five months.  Now if he had said – we have had a five-year lag in real wage growth, his op-ed would be more factually correct.  But then admitting this reality undermines the main theme of what he wrote.  Then again – what David Brooks usually writes is completely divorced from reality.</p>

                                <p>This post is on suicide rates and how they changed over time since the 1960s when data became available. Data comes from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0108.xls">Statistical Abstract of the United States</a>, but originates with the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics. Rates are age adjusted… that is, the population age is standardized to the year 2000 levels. </p>
<p>Before we go on… what affects suicide rates? Well, presumably suicide is a function of despair and/or mental illness. Despair might increase with poverty rates and reduced chances for employment. Similarly, cuts in mental illness treatment is likely to increase despair. Even something as nebulous as feeling the President cares might make a difference… or does it? </p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqXp_EPDHbI/AAAAAAAAAeI/yicji1bhxG4/s1600-h/Suicide+Rate,+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqXp_EPDHbI/AAAAAAAAAeI/yicji1bhxG4/s320/Suicide+Rate,+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqXp4UPDHaI/AAAAAAAAAeA/JAED5WJQrRQ/s1600-h/Suicide+Rate,+table.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqXp4UPDHaI/AAAAAAAAAeA/JAED5WJQrRQ/s320/Suicide+Rate,+table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Assuming fewer suicides are a good thing, Carter comes in first, followed by Clinton, then GHW, and then JFK/LBJ. The remaining administrations saw increases in suicide rates. (Incidentally… a means test looking at whether the average change is different in Democrat versus Republican administrations indicates we should reject the null hypothesis that the changes in suicide rates are the same under both Dems and Reps… the result is just barely significant at the 90% level, having a P-value of 0.10.) </p>
<p>So what’s up with this? Why the poor performance in the Nixon/Ford, Reagan, and GW years? Nixon/Ford – probably some residue of Vietnam, and the tanking of the economy probably didn’t help either. Also, this was a period when many people really didn’t feel the gubmint was on their side. Reagan… probably the largescale homeless dump made a difference. I was living abroad at the time, but the Ex-GF, who was growing up in Baltimore at the time, said the change was pretty evident even in her early teens. I would imagine some number of the formerly institutionalized, or as Reagan once called them, urban campers, eventually committed suicide. If they did so on someone’s front lawn, it might even have caused real damage, driving down property values and whatnot. GW? I’m not sure. Like many series we’ve looked at so far, the positive trend in the Clinton administration halted once GW came to office. Perhaps it is simply a result of the end of <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784">our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity</a>. Or perhaps the war in Iraq, the fear of having to see Denny Hastert on the news on a regular basis, and other factors (were there cuts in psychiatric spending?) made a difference.</p>
<p>The surprise for me among the positive Presidents is GHW. Just a guess… it may be that the suicide rates among (current and recently retired) military personnel and their dependents are a not insubstantial part of the suicide rate in general, and Gulf War I’s somewhat antiseptic victory reduced the suicide rate among this group? </p>
<p>Anyone have ideas? Also&#8230; anyone have any idea where I can get historical data on homelessness?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Correction&#8230;  as originally posted, I mentioned my guess that suicide rates might be higher among military personnel and their dependents.  I forgot to mention&#8230; I think it may also be higher in those recently retired from the military.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/07/13/more_entering_army_with_criminal_records/?page=full">this</a> in a few places, and I&#8217;ve posted on it before: </p>
<blockquote><p>Nearly 12 percent of Army recruits who entered basic training this year needed a special waiver for those with criminal records, a dramatic increase over last year and 2 1/2 times the percentage four years ago, according to new Army statistics obtained by the Globe.</p>
<p>With less than three months left in the fiscal year, 11.6 percent of new active-duty and Army Reserve troops in 2007 have received a so-called &#8220;moral waiver,&#8221; up from 7.9 percent in fiscal year 2006, according to figures from the US Army Recruiting Command. In fiscal 2003 and 2004, soldiers granted waivers accounted for 4.6 percent of new recruits; in 2005, it was 6.2 percent.</p>
<p>Army officials acknowledge privately that the increase in moral waivers reflects the difficulty of signing up sufficient numbers of recruits to sustain an increasingly unpopular war in Iraq; the Army fell short of its monthly recruiting goals in May and June.</p>
<p>Since Oct. 1, 2006, when the fiscal year began, more than 8,000 of the roughly 69,000 recruits have been granted waivers for offenses ranging in seriousness from misdemeanors such as vandalism to felonies such as burglary and aggravated assault.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>Army officials say the majority of such recruits committed relatively minor offenses and have not been in prison. They point out that waivers are granted only after a careful review of each soldier&#8217;s history &#8212; and only when the applicant has shown remorse or changed behavior.</p>
<p>But former military officials and defense specialists said they fear that enlisting more soldiers with criminal backgrounds will increase the risk of disciplinary problems and criminal activity among soldiers in uniform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody who has demonstrated themselves to be guilty of misbehavior in civilian life has a good chance of behaving in the same way in the military,&#8221; said John Hutson , judge advocate general of the Navy until 2000 and now dean of the Franklin Pierce Law Center at the University of New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Hutson said he witnessed the consequences of allowing former criminal offenders to join the ranks in the 1970s, the last time the military enlisted high numbers of soldiers with criminal histories. The numbers of recruits with criminal pasts who were allowed to join in the 1970s is not available, according to the Army. But Hutson said such soldiers often showed up in military court for committing new offenses.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were all kinds of what I call &#8216;frustration offenses,&#8217; &#8221; he said, citing drug use, burglary, and violent behavior. &#8220;Some people are incapable of coping with the regimen of military life so they act out in all kinds of ways.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>But other Defense Department officials maintain that the rise in criminal waivers is also a direct result of the Army&#8217;s struggle to meet recruiting targets.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is terrific pressure put on the recruiters,&#8221; said Alan Gropman , a professor at the Pentagon&#8217;s National Defense University. &#8220;They have to meet their mission so they request more waivers. In order to make the numbers they have to lower the standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since 2003 the Pentagon has taken unprecedented steps to try to meet its recruiting goals, including lowering education standards, raising the maximum age, and steadily increasing the amount of bonuses for new volunteers. But granting more waivers for criminals, specialists said, could end up backfiring.</p>
<p>One former senior Defense official, who remains a consultant to the Pentagon, said there is growing concern in the ranks that members of street gangs have been joining the military and then engaging in criminal activity.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Reader Dan found this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/21/business/worldbusiness/21trade.html?pagewanted=1&#038;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FA%2FAgriculture"> article</a> in the NYT on the WTO GATS Doha round and agricultural tariffs:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are disputes pitting Europe against the United States, rich countries against poor countries, and farming countries against industrial countries. </p>
<p>But a major new factor in the deadlock is a global economic realignment that has vaulted China, India and Brazil into the top tier of the world’s emerging markets, much to the concern of other developing countries like Mexico, Chile and Thailand. </p>
<p>India and Brazil are refusing to lower their tariffs out of fear of export-driven economies like China’s. A second tier of developing countries that are trying to compete with India and Brazil are complaining that they are being shut out by India, Brazil and other rapidly developing countries. Meanwhile, the poorest of the poor countries in Africa and elsewhere charge that the richer emerging market economies, which portray themselves as champions of the poor, are actually ignoring their needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reader Dan wrote a letter to the author, NYT reporter Steven Weisman:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you write about the Doha negotiations, it occurred to me there are several ways to look at them. Sort of day to day and reporting official comments, or also writing an investigative series about several issues important for readers to understand the direction the agreements are taking us. Because GATS and other agreements like NAFTA, CAFTA, AUSTR, and a number of bi-lateral agreements use similar language, they form an interlocking network of rules that should be raising eyebrows if only for the US and Canada represent big changes for peoples&#8217; lives. These are NOT simply issues of freer trade versus protectionism. Each country has special interests to appease internally, but use high sounding moral speech to cover the real money issues involved. More importantly, if the Deregulation language is approved from VI.4, and eventually used with other treaties, profound changes in our own governments are in store. V was about comparative advantage, not the latest rounds. </p></blockquote>
<p>Weisman responded&#8230; he seems to be in agreement.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Reader Spencer, like a lot of other folks who frequent this blog and similar blogs, has an annoying habit of looking at data, and data has an annoying habit of not necessarily doing what our betters tell us theory says.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Spencer looking at Minimum Wage increases&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>With the Federal minimum wage increasing from $5.15 to $5.85, or 13.6% this week I expected to see several discussion of it on the Web. But it seems to be generating little interest.</p>
<p>But it did suggest that I should take a quick look at what happened so far this year in the seven states that raised their minimum wage in January, 2007. It is too early to have detailed data or comprehensive studies, so I’m just taking a quick first pass at the available data. </p>
<p>The industry most dependent on minimum wage employees is the restaurant industry, so I will compare restaurant employment to trend and employment in other sectors. If the theory that increasing the minimum wage causes minimum wage employment to fall is correct, it should negatively impact these two comparisons.</p>
<p>ARIZONA raised the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.75, or 31.1% they also raised the minimum wage for employees earning tips from $2.13 to $3.75, or 76.1%. From 1997 to 2006 Arizona was one of the fastest growing states and total nonfarm employment rose at an average annual rate of 3.5%, as did employment in Arizona restaurants. In the 12 months ending in June, 2007 total Arizona employment rose 2.9% while employment in</p>
<p>Arizona restaurants rose 4.9%. In the 6 months from December, 2006 to June, 2007, the total actually fell -1.4% while restaurant employment increased 4.1%. This is not seasonally adjusted data, so you have to be careful about using it. However, the evidence shows that restaurant employment rose much faster than other employment and in particularly rose much faster than it had over the previous 9 years when the minimum wage was held constant. Needless to say, this is not what the opponents predicted would happen.</p>
<p>COLORADO raised the overall minimum wage 44.0% and the minimum for those receiving tips 79.8%. Over the past decade total Colorado employment grew at 1.1% rate and restaurant employment expanded at a 1.7% rate. Over the past 12 months total employment rose 1.7% or about 12% faster than the recent trend. Restaurant employment rose 3.75%, or 71% faster than trend. In the last six months the not seasonally adjust gains were 1.1% for total employment and 6.3% for restaurant employment.</p>
<p>MISSOURI raised both its total minimum wage and the one for tip earners 26.2%. The trend growth rate here was 0.5% for total employment and 2.0% for restaurant employment. Over the past year total employment expanded 0.9% while restaurant employment was up 3.6%. The past 6 months NSA gains were 0.8% for the total and 5.8% for restaurants.</p>
<p>MONTANA raised its minimum wage 19.42%. This is the only state in the sample were the trend is for total employment to grow faster than restaurant employment. But over the last year total employment grew 1.6% versus its trend growth rate of 1.9%. But restaurant employment was up 1.4%, or slightly more than its trend growth rate of 1.2%.</p>
<p>The last 6 months NSA increases were 4.1% for total employment and 6.6% for restaurant employment.</p>
<p>NEVADA also raised its minimum wage 19.42%. Navada total employment rose 1.7% this year versus its trend growth rate of 4.8%. Restaurant employment was up 4.5% as compared to a trend growth rate of 8.2%.. So total employment was 36% of trend while restaurant employment was 55% of trend.</p>
<p>OHIO increased both the total minimum wage and the minimum wage for tip earners 33.0%. In Ohio the 9 year trend is for zero growth in total employment and a 1.1% increase in restaurant employment. From June, 2006 to June, 200 total employments fell 0.3% and restaurant employment rose 0.3%.</p>
<p>MASSACUHUSETTES only increased its minimum wage 11.1%. Over the past year total employment rose 1.1% as compared to a 0.4% trend. Restaurant employment rose 1.1% versus its 1.5% trend &#8212; making it and Ohio the only states with below trend restaurant employment growth. The six month NSA increases were 1% for the total and 6.3% for restaurants.</p>
<p>So we had seven states raising their minimum wage from between 11% and 78% for tip earners. The worse case was in Massachusetts where restaurant employment grew at the same rate as total employment. In the other six cases restaurant employment growth was stronger than total employment growth&#8211;what appear to be the normal pattern. But in four states – Arizona, Colorado, Missouri and Montana – restaurant employment growth was above trend. Massachusetts was the only state with above trend total employment growth and a below trend increase in restaurant employment – what the opponents of the minimum wage would predict.</p>
<p>These comments do not pretend to be conclusive, and is only a quick first look at the data. I do not claim it proves anything. But at best, Massachusetts is the only one of the seven states that appears to support the opponents of the minimum wage argument that it causes minimum wage employment to drop and harms the minimum wage employee. In every other case restaurant employment relative to trend was stronger than total employment growth relative to trend, exactly the opposite of what should happen if minimum wage increases cause minimum wage employment to fall. </p>
<p>It will be very interesting to see more studies of these seven states and of what happens on a national basis after the increase in the federal minimum wage. </p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; </p>
<p>The Commonwealth Fund, a non-partisan think tank, <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/publications_show.htm?doc_id=482678">charts other factors to determine rankings of a country’s health care</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. health system is the most expensive in the world, but comparative analyses consistently show the United States underperforms relative to other countries on most dimensions of performance. This report, which includes information from primary care physicians about their medical practices and views of their countries&#8217; health systems, confirms the patient survey findings discussed in previous editions of Mirror, Mirror. It also includes information on health care outcomes that were featured in the U.S. health system scorecard issued by the Commonwealth Fund Commission on a High Performance Health System.</p>
<p>Among the six nations studied—Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States—the U.S. ranks last, as it did in the 2006 and 2004 editions of Mirror, Mirror. Most troubling, the U.S. fails to achieve better health outcomes than the other countries, and as shown in the earlier editions, the U.S. is last on dimensions of access, patient safety, efficiency, and equity. The 2007 edition includes data from the six countries and incorporates patients&#8217; and physicians&#8217; survey results on care experiences and ratings on various dimensions of care.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/05/15/1198/">Common Dreams</a> indicates that as was found in past surveys, the U.S. is an outlier in terms of financial burdens placed on patients. One–half of adults with health problems in the U.S. said they did not see a doctor when sick, did not get recommended treatment, or did not fill a prescription because of cost. Despite these high rates of forgone care, one-third of U.S. patients spent more than $1,000 out-of-pocket in the past year. There were wide and significant variations in access and waiting times on multiple dimensions across the six countries. </p>
<blockquote><p>Respondents in Canada and the U.S. were significantly less likely than those in other countries to report same-day access and more likely to wait six days or longer for an appointment. At the same time, majorities of patients in New Zealand (58%) and Germany (56%), and nearly half in Australia (49%) and the U.K. (45%), were able to get same-day appointments. Waiting times for elective surgery or specialists were shortest in Germany and the U.S., with the majority of patients in both countries reporting rapid access.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Relative to the U.S. and Canada, the four countries reporting comparatively rapid access to physicians—Australia, Germany, New Zealand, and the U.K.—also had significantly lower rates of emergency room use.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><br />
<blockquote>The authors say that no country emerges as a clear winner or loser. All survey countries experience high rates of safety risks, failure to coordinate care during transitions, inadequate communication, and a lack of support for chronically ill patients. These areas of shared concern, they conclude, will likely require policy innovations that transcend current payment and delivery systems.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The last vestiges of monetarism may have been put to rest on June 28, 2007. Wayne Angell, retired member of the Federal Reserve Board, appearing that night on Larry Kudlow’s show on CNBC, observed that the Fed was targeting the federal funds rate and, as such, implied that it could not control the money supply at the same time. Rather, Angell said growth in the monetary aggregates reflected the shifting demand for money, or in other words that the market determined the amount of money by demanding more (or less) of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mind you – I don’t claim to be a monetarist, but I can spot the logical flaw in the following stupidity from Mr. Nugent:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Journal piece also included this revealing Laffer paraphrase on inflation: “The ‘velocity’ of money is soaring as the world demands more of it (money), [Laffer] says, so there is no inflation threat.” In other words, Laffer is implying that the demand for money is dramatically increasing, even though the Fed deserves high marks for controlling the growth in the money supply as measured by the monetary base.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s think this through in terms of the standard IS-LM model noting that money demand depends on part on income and in part on other factors.  If the demand for money rises not because of an increase in income but due to changes in the demand for liquidity (e.g., increased risk aversion), then the LM curve shifts inward absent a change in the money supply.  The resulting higher interest rates tend to lower income along the IS curve.  Of course, the Federal Reserve could and should accommodate such money demand instability to keep interest rates from rising so as to avoid a recession.  But note – velocity declines in this case.</p>
<p>Art Laffer and Thomas Nugent appear to be babbling about an outward shift of the IS curve, which would tend to raise income and the demand for money.  Were we are full employment when the IS curve shifted out, anyone would had bothered to read a 1970 paper by <a href="http://econpapers.repec.org/article/tprqjecon/v_3A84_3Ay_3A1970_3Ai_3A2_3Ap_3A197-216.htm">William Poole</a> would recognize interest rate targeting and accommodations of such increases in money demand would be inflationary. Yet, 37 years later – we have Thomas Nugent babbling about this topic proving that he is as clueless as the rest of the nitwits at the National Review.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Reader Susan Webber of <a href="http://www.auroraadvisors.com/">Aurora Advisors</a> has an article in the <a href="http://www.conference-board.org/articles/atb_article.cfm?id=393">Conference Board Review</a>:</p>
<p>No one would dream of calling you a bigot. You’ve been a vocal supporter of diversity, made sure your few fast-track women got good job postings, and have even privately counseled gays who were worried about their chances for advancement. Perhaps some of your close friends are black.</p>
<p>But when you look around, your good intentions and actions have had little impact. Above a certain level in your company, the demographics haven’t changed much in the last decade. Every promotion decision, individually, seemed justified, yet the aggregates would support a charge of bias. And across corporate America, your experience has been replicated at dozens of companies.</p>
<p>Why does this problem persist? Why, despite all the exhortations, training programs, acknowledgment of the business case, and headline-making litigation, is it so hard to get minorities and women into executive ranks? We can talk about the usual suspects: the limitations of the talent pool or pipeline, the fact that minorities of various sorts often don’t get adequate mentoring or lack robust internal networks, that women face work/family conflicts. But these don’t completely explain the phenomenon.</p>
<p>I believe that prejudice is still a factor—yes, even after all these years of soul-searching and anti-discrimination workshops, even in the most enlightened corners of the country. And it’s not about only women and Hispanics and African-Americans&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>[These cases point up a fundamental issue: Are companies making unduly conservative choices based on their beliefs about what makes a successful candidate, when those may not be grounded in fact?&#8230;.</p>
<p>Columbia University professor Amar Bhide coined the phrase “novelty aversion,” to describe how investors shun ventures that are unprecedented—notably, both Federal Express and Cisco found it difficult to secure early funding. It isn’t much of a stretch to extend his logic to hiring and promotion. Both venture capitalists and corporations are in the business of picking winners—the former attractive investments, the latter talented employees&#8230;..</p>
<p>Consider the experience of Oakland A’s general manager Billy Beane, the hero of Michael Lewis’s Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. The baseball industry has always measured players’ skill and achievements by a handful of well-known statistics, but in recent years researchers have questioned the value of those traditional measures. To make the most of a limited budget, Beane used the new principles to sign low-salaried players whom his analysis showed were dramatically undervalued. The result: The team, with one of baseball’s lowest payrolls, has placed first or second in its division each of the last eight years.<br />Here, then, you have a business where the recruiting is unusually transparent, the basic rules have remained unchanged for decades, competitive encounters are in full view, and the incentives for success are high. This would seem to be the perfect environment for developing good decision rules, yet the entire industry was largely wrong.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Read the rest of it. Its a different way of looking at discrimination</p>
