                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Regular readers know my formative years were spent in South America in the dictatorship years. Whether its a positive or a negative, I often think of politics like a South American might have done a few decades ago.</p>
<p>So consider this. Say your country is fighting an existential struggle against a foreign collectivist philosophy, and there are two political parties &#8211; the Patriots and the Collaborators. (The name of these two parties differed by country, but otherwise the similarities were sufficient across Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, etc., from about the 1930s to the mid 1980s that I hope the reader will excuse my taking a shortcut here.) The Patriots are allied with the military, old money, and big business and are willing to fight to keep that foreign collectivist philosophy from gaining any foothold. The Collaborators&#8230; well, I picked the name for a reason &#8211; the Patriots call them collaborators. For whatever reason, folks like students, university professors, union members, peasants seem to throw their lot in with this group in whatever country you&#8217;re talking about. Granted, if you asked them, most of the Collaborators would insist that their opposition to having the military/old money/big business call the shots doesn&#8217;t make them supporters of this foreign collectivist philosophy, but hey, they&#8217;re Collaborators so why would anyone believe them?</p>
<p>The story differs by country, but it was often the case that the Patriots were forced to have a coup in the the 1930s or 1940s, in the 1950s, and also again in the 1960s or 1970s. And it was for the good of the country. </p>
<p>Now, consider the position of a President from the Patriot party. He&#8217;s fighting a war &#8211; perhaps its metaphorical, perhaps not. Either way, the war is not going well. Consequences of losing the war, of course, would be disastrous for the country, and the fight is worth the price. Granted, he hasn&#8217;t instituted the draft, or if he has, it only snags the poor (in a country like Chile or Argentina, you wouldn&#8217;t find the sons of wealthy families in the military &#8211; maybe just maybe you&#8217;d find a few members of the middle class depending on the decade, and in Brazil, I doubt even that was true), and he isn&#8217;t willing to change that, but still, he understands its a desperate fight, worth the lives of soldiers and the enemies. Its also worth borrowing a lot of money to fight that war&#8230; paying for it out of taxes, though, would clearly be a silly idea, as any member of his Party could explain.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s consider decisions this President might have had to make. Put yourself in the position of this President &#8211; you know, absolutely, and without any doubt, that this threat is existential. Which of the following are you justified in doing?</p>
<p>1. Using government resources to promote Patriot candidates.<br />2. Using government resources to suppress votes among perceived supporters of the Collaborators.<br />3. Using government resources to monitor perceived Collaborator voters.<br />4. Using government resources to monitor Collaborator candidates.<br />5. Using government resources to hurt perceived Collaborator supporters.<br />6. Using government resources to hurt Collaborator candidates.<br />7. Arresting perceived supporters of the Collaborator party.<br />8. Arresting candidates of the Collaborator party.<br />9. Killing perceived supporters of the Collaborator party.<br />10.  Killing candidates of the Collaborator party.<br />11.  Openly killing perceived supporters of the Collaborator party.<br />12.  Openly killing canddiates of the Collaborator party.<br />13.  Cancelling elections.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know&#8230; its a tough question, but if you know, if you truly absolutely positively know without any shadow of a doubt that this existential fight to the death is on, you should be willing to take all of these options. And these are things that happened not once but multiple times in every single one of the countries that I mentioned from the 1930s to the 1980s. I note&#8230; in many cases, I think it could be said that the President wasn&#8217;t a true believer &#8211; just some SOB who liked to be in power.  I also don&#8217;t think (and this is just my opinion talking) the taking of these steps was justified in even a single case of which I&#8217;m aware in South America from the 1930s to the 1980s.  Not one.  </p>
<p>(Note&#8230; this isn&#8217;t to say that I don&#8217;t think its possible to come up with real world circumstances where these steps are all justified.  But its not as easy as you think&#8230; consider the classic (Latin American) example of Cuba, for instance&#8230;  keeping Fidel Castro and his thugs from power would probably have been worth that price, but would it be worth the price if keeping Batista and his thugs in power was added to the bargain?  And is it not likely that the fact that Batista was exercising all these options, 1 through 13, long before Castro came to the scene was partly responsible for creating Castro in the first place?  If you didn&#8217;t like the thugs in power, what options did you have?  Who could you support?  And how could you gather enough information, in that environment, to find out that the alternative might be worse?) </p>
<p>Just for grins, pretend a guy we all know, GW, was placed in the position of this President. My guess is that GW, or some of the people he surrounds himself with are quite comfortable with , <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/25/AR2007032501048.html">option 1</a> and <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2167284/pagenum/all/#page_start">option 2</a>. I don&#8217;t think a lot of people would be surprised if it also turns out that some <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/washington/29nsa.html?ei=5090&#038;en=d689a624e9208b40&#038;ex=1343361600&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss&#038;pagewanted=all">perfectly justifiably programs were used for option 3</a>, but most of us would be surprised if he was comfortable using them for option 4. Similarly, it would seem that there is a willingness to play <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/06/05/cia.leak.trial/index.html">option 5</a>. </p>
<p>I could see instances where option 6 would also be on the table for GW&#8217;s people, but I don&#8217;t see options 7 or 8.  And options 9 through 13, I do not believe GW or his people would do it under any circumstances.  The thing I wonder is&#8230; if he truly believes, and I believe he truly believes, why isn&#8217;t he willing to take these steps? I&#8217;m glad he isn&#8217;t, but I still wonder why.  And I wonder about some of his supporters.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Cons:</p>
<p>My wife wanted me to run around the countryside shopping for curtains yesterday, and she bribed me by buying my lunch at Red Lobster (I’m easy).</p>
<p>While enjoying my feast I looked out the back window of this particular site and looked straight at an abandoned Wal-Mart. The place looked almost new, just abandoned.</p>
<p>On our way to the curtain store we passed a brand new “Super” Wal-Mart, about 500 yards from the abandoned store.</p>
<p>Does this make sense to anyone?</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Many lower income people are not especially welcome at banks.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart has a new form of prepaid Visa debit card, enhanced over prepaid Visas available elsewhere by serving a check cashing function (if the cashed check is put on the card, no fee) and allowing direct deposit of a paycheck. I believe the debit card be used to withdraw from an ATM.</p>
<p>For those who are not familiar with these cards, they are name imprinted and can be refilled at tens of thousands of retail stores for a modest fee (certainly more modest than payday loan and check cashing places). The card can be used anywhere a Visa debit card can be used.</p>
<p>We found these cards helpful when our children traveled, had car emergencies, and etc. so they can be useful to lots of people. The new Wal-Mart version has the additional features.</p>
<p>So although Wal-Mart was blocked from banking, this seems to be a useful addition to their services. For someone without a bank relationship this could reduce the need to carry cash and allows the convenience of a debit card.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart still has the standard gift cards and reloadable “student” gift card, good only for shopping at Wal-Mart.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/07/blinder-on-taxing-carried-interest.html">Greg Mankiw</a> comes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/business/yourmoney/29view.html?ei=5090&#038;en=973b345a4a0b4227&#038;ex=1343361600&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">Alan Blinder</a> on the taxation of carried interest:</p>
<blockquote><p>An arcane debate is raging in Congress over the appropriate taxation of the bountiful incomes of people who manage private-equity and hedge funds &#8211; incomes that can range into the hundreds of millions a year. I don’t recommend trying to master the details unless you have either an accounting degree or insomnia. But one thing is easy to understand, though hard to swallow: Some people who are richer than Croesus are paying 15 cents in federal income taxes on the marginal dollar, while you may be paying 25 or 35 cents.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/alan-blinder-lo.html">Mark Thoma</a> found the following interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why do we have a preference for capital gains in the first place? The main argument is that lower taxes on capital gains boost investment. But the evidence on that point is iffy at best, and there are better ways to spur investment, like, say, the investment tax credit. Besides, lower taxes on capital gains reduce the tax bills of the rich relative to the rest of us &#8211; after all, they own most of the capital. But in this age of hyper-inequality, shouldn’t we be making the tax code more progressive, not less? A far more important objection is that the tax preference for capital gains undermines capitalism &#8211; a system in which capitalists, not the state, are supposed to make the investment decisions. When I discuss this issue with my Economics 101 students, I show them an example of a proposed investment that loses money before tax (and which, therefore, should be rejected) but which actually turns a profit after tax because of the preferentially low capital gains rate. (Accountants and tax lawyers live this example every day.) The government thus induces people to make bad investments, which is a good way to run an economy into the ground. Come to think of it, that’s just what the old Soviet Union did. It invested copiously, but badly. BUT would taxing capital gains like other types of income imperil our economy? No. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 did exactly that, and it did not end capitalism as we know it. In fact, the gross domestic product in 1987 and 1988 grew at about the same rate as in 1985 and 1986, and the investment share of G.D.P. barely budged. As the tax debate unfolds, you may find it difficult to follow the mind-numbing complexities. Who doesn’t? So just remember one simple principle: If we tax Activity A at 15 percent and Activity B at 38 percent, a free-market economy will give us more A and less B. Some of this shifting will represent genuine movements of resources out of B and into A &#8211; including those bad investments I just mentioned. The rest will be paper manipulations devised to avoid taxes. Which of these do you think our tax code should favor?</p></blockquote>
<p>The distortion effects from preferential treatment of certain kinds of capital income is a point that I think deserves more attention.  The pseudo-economists from the right (many who write for the National Review) want us to believe that cutting tax rates for capital gains promotes growth.  Alan Blinder presents a very coherent argument that they may have this all wrong.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Who really wants the yuan to rise? Who does not and why? Two parties are not interested in the yuan being seriously revalued. The first is China; the second is the Treasury Department, which now speaks primarily for Western firms in China. The reason? The answer is <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-07/28/content_5445216.htm">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to Vice-Premier Wu told a dinner in Washington in May attended by Paulson and Bernanke that the yuan&#8217;s value was not the cause of the deficit.<br />She added that about 85 per cent of China&#8217;s surplus with the US is from foreign companies exporting products no longer made in the United States, such as shoes. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Eighty-five percent,&#8221; economists. Western firms in China, not indigenous Chinese firms, account for eight-five percent of China&#8217;s trade surplus with the U.S.</p>
<p>Meanwhile&#8211;as reported in the above article and <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/070727/us/politics_usa_china_bill_dc">elsewhere</a>&#8211;the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday voted 20-1 on a bill that would give the U.S. the tools to address the currency misalignment as well as countering dumping. But the Treasury Department really does not want anything to do with this proposed legislation, insisting that &#8220;discussions&#8221; are the way to go. Chuckle.</p>
<p>Quite honestly, this administration likes the peg, and will be led kicking and screaming to do anything serious about it. Foreign companies, especially American ones, are doing quite well in China&#8211;and profiting handsomely from the peg.  Apple&#8217;s profits are skyrocketing. In fact, American companies, mnc&#8217;s cozily ensconced in developing nations, have led the stock market boom of recent years. The only thing that will hurt them is the credit crunch in the U.S. &#8211;the consumer exhaustion&#8211;and the persistent high cost of energy, which is sure to go higher as we get ever closer to peak oil.</p>
<p>I have written frequently on the trade deficit and on how globalization is being mishandled, favoring large corporations and investment firms that can chase cheap labor and low taxation everywhere on the planet. I know the Treasury Department is in the pocket of these firms. I suspect that even those dreamy-eyed liberal economists who thought that globalization as structured might now be having second thoughts. But dreams die hard.</p>

<blockquote><p>Earlier yesterday, it seemed that the candidates were fleeing the unconventional format, in which the public asks questions via video. Mr. Romney told The Union Leader in Manchester, N.H., that it could be demeaning for presidential candidates to “answer questions from a snowman,” a reference to a video question that was presented to the Democratic presidential candidates in their YouTube debate on Monday … Mr. Madden said the Romney campaign’s decision not to participate was “not a question of format, it’s a question of our travel schedule.” Still, Mr. Madden said, “a lot of Americans would wonder whether we should be answering questions from a cartoon.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Madden’s choice of words will cause at least some embarrassment for Mitt the Twit.  Yes, I despise the two-faced campaign being put on by Mr. Romney but not nearly as much as the campaign being put on by Rudy Giuliani.  His latest to call Democrats a party of <a href="http://www.myfoxhouston.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=3888866&#038;version=2&#038;locale=EN-US&#038;layoutCode=TSTY&#038;pageId=3.2.1">losers</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani called Democrats &#8220;the party of losers&#8221; for demanding a scheduled pullout of American troops from Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank goodness for <a href="http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2007/jul/27/happy_hour_roundup">Joe Biden</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tough talk and cheap shots won&#8217;t make America any safer&#8230;. It is absurd for Rudy Giuliani to call Democrats ‘losers&#8217; after five years of failed Republican policies in Iraq&#8230;. Giuliani and the rest of the Republican candidates continue to cling to this Administration&#8217;s failed policy that a strong central government can be propped up in Iraq. If these are the positions he wants to defend, I invite him to debate me on these important topics.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Giuliani will likely decline this invitation for reasons similar to those for ducking the YouTube debate as explained by Katherine Seelye:</p>
<blockquote><p>Matt Lewis, who is director of operations at townahall.com, a conservative Web site, and who was not part of the petition, said Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Romney had the most to lose. I’m sure their advisers are telling them that a lot of bad things could happen in a YouTube debate,” Mr. Lewis said. “When you’re the front-runner, you don’t think so much about how you can win but how you can avoid losing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In a YouTube debate, Rudy might have to field a question from someone who is not about to tolerate his parade of lies.  Or worse yet, Rudy might have to field a question from a NYC fireman.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader brings us the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0BPnnvI47Q">snowman</a> that scares Mitt Romney. While Sammy was trying to defend Mitt the Twit, let’s thank him because this rather funny YouTube question was about Global Warming.  Yes – that important policy issue on which much of the GOP leadership has just flat lied to the American people.  A little humor from a citizen scares Romney – while brazen dishonesty from the leaders of his own party is AOK.  I get it.</p>

                                <p>Reader Dan sends a letter (the link he provided no longer applies) in the WSJ:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your page-one article &#8220;Note to Medicaid Patients: The Doctor Won&#8217;t See You,&#8221; July 19) provides a shocking commentary on the difference in attitudes and behavior to two populations, the elderly and the poor.</p>
<p>As the first chairman of the Secretary&#8217;s Medicaid Advisory Committee in the mid- and late-1960s, I can attest that these differences existed from the first days of Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>Of course it is shocking to find the difference in payment &#8212; and treatment &#8212; for the two populations by the same government.</p>
<p>If $357.58, the amount paid by Medicare, is the &#8220;correct&#8221; payment for the treatment of a broken arm, then how can $184.51 be the correct payment for a Medicaid patient? Either Medicaid is underpaying or Medicare is overpaying. We all know which.</p>
<p>Even so, it is also shocking that so few physicians will see Medicaid patients given that these physicians were more than willing to accept and be the beneficiaries of the large subsidy by government to their medical education.</p>
<p>I would suggest that each person entering medical school be given a choice: Don&#8217;t take the subsidy (somewhere in the neighborhood of $150,000 to $200,000) and be free to choose your patients as you see fit, or accept the subsidy and in return agree to treat all patients who need your help. This isn&#8217;t involuntary servitude. In the words so dear to all, the prospective physician would be &#8220;free to choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since Dan doesn&#8217;t comment, I will.  This is a phenomenom I&#8217;ve seen in a lot of industries.  One can be a rugged individualist free-market type while getting all kinds of bennies from the government.  Rugged individualist free-market views only conflict with others receiving bennies from the gubmint.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Regular readers know one of the things that annoys me is people shading or hiding information. Without information, one cannot decide what&#8217;s going on. So I was dismayed to read <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/11609.html">this piece by Steve Benen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For some inexplicable reason, Republicans have been preoccupied for quite some time with Baghdad’s electrical supply, pointing to it as one of the good-news stories that Americans allegedly don’t hear about. The <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/7883.html">White House urged</a> the media to cover it more a year ago; <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/7702.html">Tony Snow bragged</a> about Iraq’s electricity-generating facilities; and then-House Speaker boasted of Baghdad’s shining lights as an example of progress in the war.</p>
<p>At one point, the president even <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/07/20060707-1.html">felt a little sorry for himself</a>, whining to reporters at a press conference, “[I]ncreasing electricity in Baghdad is not the kind of thing that tends to get on the news.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The reason Benen feels this focus makes little sense is that&#8230; the electricity supply to Baghdad has been dropping and dropping and dropping&#8230; Eventually, reality catches up even with this administration, so they came up with a plan to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-na-iraqpower27jul27,0,7131927,full.story?coll=la-home-center">do something about it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the Bush administration struggles to convince lawmakers that its Iraq war strategy is working, it has stopped reporting to Congress a key quality-of-life indicator in Baghdad: how long the power stays on.</p>
<p>Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week that Baghdad residents could count on only “an hour or two a day” of electricity. That’s down from an average of five to six hours a day earlier this year.</p>
<p>But that piece of data has not been sent to lawmakers for months because the State Department, which prepares a weekly “status report” for Congress on conditions in Iraq, stopped estimating in May how many hours of electricity Baghdad residents typically receive each day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead, they&#8217;ll report on &#8220;electricity generated nationwide&#8221;, rather than electricity actually received anywhere. There are three advantages to this I can see for folks who are more interested in manipulation of data than actual results:</p>
<p>1. The new series is not comparable with the old series, making then and now comparisons harder.<br />2. Electricity generation is easier than actually getting it supplied somewhere.<br />3. Electricity generation figures are easier to fudge than electricity supply figures. One can always say: &#8220;We produced X gigawatts.&#8221; How do you check? But if they claim &#8220;Baghdad is receiving 20 hours of electricity a day&#8221; anyone at a hotel in the city can tell you whether that figure is in the ballpark or not.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a bad sign all around. Its a bad sign that once again, data is being manipulated. And its a bad sign that things are getting worse in Iraq. Come to think of it, hiding this data in itself gives us some data about what is going on.</p>

                                <p>Apparently the New Republic published an article by a soldier in Iraq describing some bad behavior he had observed committed by some US troops.</p>
<p>Read <a href="http://jonswift.blogspot.com/2007/07/punishing-scott-thomas-beauchamp.html">Jon Swift</a> to get a snarky view of the reaction of the right blogosphere. (BTW&#8230; he has a link to a video taken from inside a hummer driving in Baghdad &#8211; its worth a watch.) </p>
<p>I have no idea if the guy from TNR is lying or not and I don&#8217;t read TNR. I do recognize that bad things happen in war, and if whether its accurate or not, its extremely unlikely that no soldiers in Iraq are behaving more or less as described. So what I found interesting about the views from the right is the idea that <a href="http://betsyspage.blogspot.com/2007/07/scott-thomas-identified.html">someone with real concern &#8230; would have reported such behavior to the authorities</a>.</p>
<p>So I went rummaging around and found this fascinating paper presented <a href="http://www.usafa.af.mil/jscope/JSCOPE02/Bordin02.html">military&#8217;s Joint Services Conference On Professional Ethics</a>. It describes a few examples of, um, &#8220;distaste for independent thinkers&#8221; that have occurred in the military. </p>
<p>Consider the difference in the career paths that happened two characters involved peripherally in My Lai massacre. (Also noted in the report I cited.) </p>
<p>Hugh Thompson, who tried to stop the massacre, was &#8220;at grave risk of being courts-martialed for his actions and was ostracized and eventually involuntarily discharged from the U.S. Army.&#8221; On the other hand, Major Colin Powell, &#8220;refuted and disparaged the few enlisted soldiers who came forth to report the atrocity&#8221; and we all know where he eventually ended up. </p>
<p>More recently, there was the Tillman incident, and the Jessica Lynch incident&#8230; but those were the well-known incidents. Perhaps you feel those were all the incidents&#8230; who would know about most of them? Who would know what happened to the people involved? </p>
<p>And given how long it takes for the record to be set right in the cases where it is set right (again, we all remember who made out better in the end &#8211; Thompson or Colin Powell, just as one example), why would we expect anyone to speak up? Seriously?</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Aside 1. I find it interesting that at one point Powell was seriously considered a presidential contender. Its not just the My Lai massacre, he also was involved in Iran Contra. Clearly towing the line what people look for in a soldier.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>This post should not be understood as anti-military. In my opinion, most large organization &#8211; and that includes most large corporations &#8211; develop a certain amount of groupthink and punish those who violate that groupthink. Regular readers know I&#8217;ve written about that in the past.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>There is a lot of antiwar sentiment here on this blog and in the country.  We get our information mainly as it is presented by the media and filtered through the pundits.  This post is not to cast aspersions on the anti war but to celebrate the honest heartfelt motivations of this 23 year old, UCLA  grad, married young man who voluteered to go to Iraq and he encapsulates the best of why we fight over there (if only GWB was this eloquent) on his <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&#038;friendID=46348938"> myspace page.</a>  Please read it carefully.  Some of the highlights:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why I Joined: This question has been asked of me so many times in so many different contexts that I thought it would be best if I wrote my reasons for joining the Army on my page for all to see.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>What was once a paralyzed state of fear is now the staging ground for one of the largest transformations of power and ideology the Middle East has experienced since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Thanks to Iran, Syria, and other enlightened local actors, this transformation will be plagued by interregional hatred and genocide. And I am now in the center of this. Is this why I joined? Yes.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>I joined the fight because it occurred to me that many modern day &#8220;humanists&#8221; who claim to possess a genuine concern for human beings throughout the world are in fact quite content to allow their fellow &#8220;global citizens&#8221; to suffer under the most hideous state apparatuses and conditions. Their excuses used to be my excuses. When asked why we shouldn&#8217;t confront the Ba&#8217;ath party, the Taliban or the various other tyrannies throughout this world, my answers would allude to vague notions of cultural tolerance (forcing women to wear a veil and stay indoors is such a quaint cultural tradition), the sanctity of national sovereignty (how eager we internationalists are to throw up borders to defend dictatorships!) or even a creeping suspicion of America&#8217;s intentions. When all else failed, I would retreat to my fragile moral ecosystem that years of living in peace and liberty had provided me.</p></blockquote>
<p>One final note: he was <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/homepage/article_1547859.php">killed</a> January 2007.  </p>
<p>Was his life wasted?</p>
